5,Son enjoyed this.,"My son enjoyed this game once he put down the NBA Live. What else can I say, I got my money's worth."
5,The best in the series,"Man I bought this gameback when it was 50$ but even then it was worth it dozens of skaters to beat the game with not to mention you can change what the look like and you can even create your own skaters the goals are fun and not that hard except a few you can unlock some cool charecters such as Darth Maul, Woverine, and some from the first such as Officer Dick and you can also unlock levels from the first such as the Warehouse and Burnside overall the graphics are good the soudtrack with keep you tricking off for hours this is huge game and will take you awhile to complete with dozens of unlockables ... you can't go wrong"
4,Not your typical skateboarding game...,"Let me start off by saying that I HATE skateboarding, biking, snowboarding, skiing, and all other extreme sports games. They're repetitive, boring, and get old very quickly. Imagine my surprise, then, when at a friend's house, I actually truly enjoyed playing this game.Other reviewers have talked about how cool the levels are and how smoothe the gameplay is, but I'd like to talk about a feature that not a lot of people have mentioned: the custom skater feature. You can create your own skater, customize his or her appearance, and set your ability levels for six or seven different categories. The coolest part, though, is that the different skin shades, body types, and articles of clothing, allows you to create a skater that really LOOKS LIKE YOU!! Why would I want to play as Tony Hawk or anybody else, when I can watch myself on the screen catching major air and landing McTwists?Definitely a worthy game to buy (or at least to bum off of your friend! :)"
3,Tony Hawk's Pro Scater 3,"The package came like brand new. Was very impressed on the quick ship time and what great condition it came in . THE ONE THING I WAS NOT IMPRESSED ABOUT IS I MADE 5 PURCHASES THAT DAY AND THIS IS THE COST OF SHIPPING AND HANDLING WAS $$$ AND THE PRODUCT WAS ONLY $$$ . WHATS WRONG WITH THIS PIC. NON OF MY OTHER 2 GAMES OR OTHER 2 DVDS CHARGED ANYWHERE NEAR OR CLOSE TO WHAT YOU CHARGED FOR SHIPPING. GUESS THIS IS A WAY TO MAKE YOUR MONEY BACK AND GET THE SELL AND THEN HIT PEOPLE ON SHIPPING ... NOT FAIR AND NOT RIGHT PER THE CONSUMER . JACQUE WOODS 11618 Opossum Creek Corpus Christi, Texas 78410 Disappointed only in shipping price."
5,The Awesomeness,"I got this game for Christmas with Madden 2002. I play it almost all the time. I loved Tony Hawk 2, but this is so much better. I love how you can interact with other people, and revert helps so much. I like how it is easier to balance grinds and manuals. This gane is awesome."
3,"wow, it was so easy","by far this is the best THPS game, with amazing graphics and tricks there is no reason to not enjoy it. this game was very fun while it lasted. only 8 levels with 9 easy missions, WHAT WERE THE CREATERS THINKING? i dont know. if they come out with a fourth tony hawk make at least 20 level with at least 15-30 difficult missions. that it why i only gave it 3 stars, it was a fun game but it was too short. if you get tired of it play it with your friends while you are stoned."
2,Yoko Ono,"I think the graphics are improved from Tony Hawk 2 but not too significantly. I think Tony Hawk 2 was a more fun game to play than Tony Hawk 3, the levels on the 2nd one are better and the ramps are laid out better to get huge amounts of points. I wish I hadn't bought the 3rd one without renting it first."
3,Great Tony Hawk style but lacking depth!,"I was a huge fan of THPS2 on Dreamcast. I think I beat the game with every character and opened up all the secret levels. So naturally when I bought my PS2 I ran out and grabbed THPS3. Well at first it was great. Same great style and fun to play but after I gotinto it I realized that it was just the same game in some new levels. Now the levels were more creative than 2's but they were not as compelling to play. In fact I downright hated many of the levels you got to. There were few improvements over 2, just the revert eveyone talks about and the create-a-park was pretty much the same. I never really got into this version and I beat it through in a few days and gave it on to a friend. I can't wait to pick up THPS4 because that is where they really make strides in bettering this already great series."
4,"Outdated, but still the best Skatebording game around.","This game was made over 1 year ago. It has average graphics (nothing to show off here). However the gameplay more than makes up for the visual dissapoinment. You can create your own skatepark, and play throughout the many pre-made levels. If you beat certain levels you can select new skateboards. Overall this is a great game...."
3,First Slayers CD,"The Slayers is one of best animes there is, and the music is just as good. The main intro song, Get Along, is one of the best on the cd. It is a must buy for Slayers fans."
4,Dragon Slave!,"This cd was definatly worth the wait I had to wait. This cd had awsome vocals and wonderful BGM. Even though I would think it would be better with more vocals, the 3 vocals they have on it are just as good. Most of the songs on this cd are short and simple and last no more than 1-3 min. The vocals on it are longer. These songs are only from the first series of Slayers even though some of the BGM can be heard in other series. They made a mistake with the title calling it Slayers Next:Bible 1 it is actually called Slayers Excellent 1.This cd was really good and it still is when I listen to it in fact you have a hard time pulling me away from my head phones ^_^ I definitly think anyone who loves the Slayers or just good music should order this. Getting this cd has made me order other Slayers cd's which I can't wait to get! ^.~"
3,Wait for it to go on-sale.,"It sounds like a Glenn Frye/Don Henley album (former Eagles band members). This album contains love songs, but I'd recommend Bonnie Raitt. Country music should have biting lyrics like Lyle Lovett's. For better Clint Country, I'd recommend ""No Time To Kill.""""Nothin' But The Tail Lights"" talks about Kentucky License plates, but the inside cover shows California plates! Clint has Gone Hollywood. The guitar and drumming are great, but the lyrics don't seem to ride along. ""What I Feel Inside"" and ""You Know It All"" are poems with (slightly disconnected) background music.I loved him in concert, but not so much with this album. I hope this sound isn't the future of Country. It's all sounding way too much like mid-70's rock and roll to me. ""pop-country"" uugh."
4,"Intelligent lyrics, excellent musicianship, sweet sound","Love it! As on No Time to Kill and The Hard Way Mr. Black isn't afraid to let his band and collaborators shine. I have to admire any frontman who doesn't let ego prevent him from letting an excellent band show off their chops. Jerry Douglas, Allison Kraus, Mark Knopfler - what a dream team! I also love lyrics - especially country lyrics - that are intelligent and articulate. And, while it may be a little corny for some, Something That We Do, is THE song I would write for my wife if I had the skill."
4,An Excellent Blend of New Country,"Although ""Nothin' But The Taillights,"" doesn't match the intensity of Clint Black's first album, ""Killin' Time,"" ""Nothin' But The Taillights"" combines heartache, love, and life into a wonderful album. The title track is the album's best, with ""Something That We Do"" and ""The Shoes You're Wearing"" also highlighting the album. Not surprisingly, all three went to #1 on the national charts. Although other fans and I would like Clint to return to the honky-tonk tradition of his first three albums, ""Nothin' But The Taillights"" is worth the money. As with all of Clint's albums, he had a hand in writing every song!"
5,great for upper body,I am a little picky about my videos. i like a intense video for upper body. i found it here. cathe takes the band and puts it to good use. give it a try it is intense and invigorating. enjoy.
5,a hidden gem...,"I also stumbled across this disc by accident. I was aware of Ms. Purl as an actress but not a singer. I love this disc!! The choice of songs and arrangements are impeccable. There are many familiar songs but with fresh new takes. Among my favorites are ""I Can Let Go Now"", Teach Me Tonight"" and ""This Girl's in Love With You."" When's the follow-up coming out?"
1,Again???,"I find some of the songs danceable, but not really my favorite style. If you prefer a more modern, fusion-style bellydance, you may like this CD.The low rating, because this CD is getting published over and over again in different packaging. These songs have already been published as part of ""Belly Dance - An Erotic Blend of Music"". It was also published as ""Modern Belly Dance by Maroon Shaker"" - once again a different picture. The songs are identical, not even worked over and republished with a different sound. Enough already!"
4,Shirley will dance forever,"As usual, Shirley weaves her wonderful thoughts about life throughout the book. It's an inspiring book about what it's like to get older and how it effected Shirley's life. I especially liked the parts about her daughter as she isn't mentioned much in the other books. I would love to hear from any one interested in Shirley and what she has to say."
5,Works Great - Looks Great,"Gone is the strip of pantyhose/nylon stretched over a loop made from an old coat hanger.... My setup looks that tiny bit more professional....This clamps very tightly to my mike stand - I have adjusted it, bumped into it, etc. and it is still in place. It seems to work and cost very little - particularly when you look at prices on anything to do with a studio.... Recommended"
5,Awesome!,"All my p's and s's no longer make a loud pop sound. It does what it's supposed to. The filter is actually double. I blew into the filer and felt the air in front of my mouth and the air on the other side, and almost none of it got through. Also, my mic doesn't have a stand, but the clamp just grabs onto anything, which is nice. The flexible arm is also really nice, and I see it lasting a few years. If you have a mic and make videos or music you NEED one of these. And why look any farther? This one is cheap and really good quality. Also, I recommend the C-1U mic, for anyone looking for a USB mic."
4,great product great price,"It does exactly what it's supposed to. Some people have said it seems large and although I haven't purchased other pop filters, I'd say the size seems pretty standard. I suppose other filters come in 4"" which seems like a good size and I might have liked that better. The flexible cord easily shapes to adjust where you need the filter, but it also remains to be relatively sturdy. I use it with a desk stand primarily and my AT2020 mic."
3,cheap filter that does the work,"It has its ups and downs, first of all the clamp is a bit hard to place so that it doesn't swing here and there, second the wire(or the line that holds the filter what ever you call that) likes to move a lot, it just wont stay still until you try hard. third the filter itself is very fragil so be careful with it, I had to get a replacement(which was free because it was not my fault) but yea it was ripped when i opened the package and i think it was due to poor handling? I don't know but again take care of the filter its FRAGIL!!!"
5,Works!,This pop filter is easy to install and is very important to take your vocals over the edge for the best studio quality. GET IT!
1,Do Not BUY THIS,I would not recommend this to anyone.Do not do what a pop filter is supposed to.Please do not waste your money.
5,Great deal!,"My local music store sells pop filters for like $30 and that's for the generic brand ones, This is a great deal and they ship out fast, it got here the same day as my mic stand and I couldn't have been more excited snag this thing!"
3,You Get What You Pay For,"I record as a hobby so I wanted to get a filter, but saw no need to purchase an expensive one. So after searching Amazon I came across the Nady and it was cheap. That's all it took. It looked good initially, but just after using it twice the screw nob became very loose and I wasn't able to tighten it completely. I managed to rig it and made it work and I'm content with that. Wasn't expecting much, but still was a bit disappointed that it ""broke"" so soon."
4,Good for a standing microphone,"The Nady is a good utilitarian filter at a great price. If I wanted it for a microphone stand, it would have been a steal. It will cover just about any sized microphone, is made from good solid metal, and does its job as advertised. My only problem is that the online page gives you the impression that it is perfect for a desk-top microphone like the ones popular for podcasting. Nothing is further from the truth. The clamp will only fit on classic microphone stand."
4,Good for the price,"Works well for what I payed for it, the neck on it isn't quite strong enough to hold it up sometimes"
3,"clamp is difficult to use, neck loses support","This pop filter does it's job, but the clamp often slides and doesn't tighten as well as I'd like it to. The bendy neck is also starting to lose its strength."
2,Nady MPF 6 inch pop filter,"Where this is attached to the plate is very loose and makes it very difficult to get into the position needed without touching the mic stand. Mounting this to a round tube mic stand is interesting as well, as the rubber foot in the square holder wants to fall off with any amount of force applied with the tightening screw."
3,Keeps Falling Down,"The filter and clamp part is awesome. The filter works like it should and the clamp easily connects anywhere on my mic stand. The only problem I have is that the flixible arm will not hold up the filter hardly at all. As soon as I get the filter where I want it, it starts to slowly drop and it gets frustrating at times. I end up having to take my filter and put it up and over the mic to where it is resting on the top of the mic and thats not ideal. Next pop filter I buy Im gonna make sure it actually holds its place."
1,Flimsy,"I returned this days after receiving it. The filter is too heavy for the bendable lever, so it droops. Very unhappy that it didn't work out, but turns out I didn't need it for my purposes!"
4,Decent quality and I got a good price,The tightening screw is a little cheezy but it works well and is easy to position where you need it.
4,Does the trick,"I am new to voice acting, but I definitely see a big improvement in my recordings with the pop filter. I haven't tried others to compare, but this do the trick!"
3,Sucky arm,"Eh, whatever. It's a cheap thing; the arm just doesn't really stay where it's supposed to. Which is kind of the idea of the product, isn't it, that it's modular? But no, you have to move it around on the mic stand until it's where IT wants to be, and hope for the best. Otherwise, it sags like crazy. It can't support the weight of itself."
4,Hmm,This item does what it's suppose to do blocks the breathing and spit when singing or rapping very good for price though the goose neck sucks as supportment.
3,Pretty legit,Good product. Clamps well to the rugged/rubbery part of the mic stand. Has some troubles staying secured on the smooth part of the stand. Overall solid piece of equipment...especially for the price.
2,"Eh, it works, kinda",It works perfectly for its intended use of preventing plosives. Gives me much better mic sound.The adjustment arm is almost useless as it doesn't hold its position. I decided to simply tape it to my mic stand instead of sending it back.
2,Average at best pop filter.,"I've been pursuing voiceover for three years. I've been using this filter for the last couple and have had mixed success using it with two different mics (A Samson C01U and a Studio Projects C-1). Unfortunately, errant pops sneak into my recordings fairly often. I will grant that they're quiet pops, only loud enough to be heard with studio headphones. But still, a quiet pop is just enough to ruin the recording if you strive for professional quality. If you're a hobbyist looking for a cheap filter that'll work okay, go ahead and grab it; just be aware that some pops will show up in your recordings. If you're looking for something that will completely eliminate all plosives, I'd recommend paying a little extra money for something better."
2,Untruthful Seller,"I ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it ""New,"" and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First, the package was stapled, that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new, I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone, I would not recommend buying from this seller."
3,NADY Pop Filter,"The Filter works very well.The head is made of good material, the flex arm holds position and is also made of good materials.the base and clamp is acceptable but I would like to have seen a better screw design.To open it up enough to fit around a mic stand or tripod leg it screws past the threads. once around the leg you then have to re-thread the screw back into the base.On the end of the screw where it contacts the leg is a plastic pad, this should have been made to swivel on the end of the screw so that it would contour to the device you are attaching to andIt also would have made it easier to clamp tightly. The way it is designed since the pad is fixed it wants to walk off the leg and makes is difficult to tighten securely.Overall is works fine and does the job it was designed to do, it just could use some improvements.Still a good buy for the price."
3,Works great but a little heavy,"This item does what it is intended to do, stop pops in your sound system. The flexable neck is a little weak or the filter is too heavy for it because it keeps falling down. Has come up with fix though so I would say it is worth the money."
1,Poor Neck Quality Compromises Product,"The flexible neck between the clamp and the ring isn't strong enough to carry the weight of the nylon filter. The result is a pop filter which cannot be used with boom mic stands. The filter refuses to stay in place, and will drop the moment you remove your hands. This means that product needs constant re-adjusting. Which, of course, results in the sound of fidgeting with the pop filter is picked up the mic."
4,"Seems to work fine, but has a large footprint","I bought this along with the On Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand, Black. It's a little large for this set up. But, as far as pops and clicks, so far it works just fine in front of my AKG Perception 220 in its spider cage."
3,Not bad for the price,"The price for this filter is good. I'll say the clip is a little hard to use and the bendy arm sometimes doesn't want to bend where you want it. The filter itself works well enough and for my recording purposes, buying something more expensive didn't make sense."
1,Awful design,Doesn't clamp onto many things because of the fact that the clamp on the bottom side comes like a triangle clamp and not flat. Also the bolt that holds together the filter doesn't stay tight ever
2,loose?,It wouldn't stay on the stand and stop moving... like a loose screw caused it or something. There is no difference when I used it for my Blue Yetti mic and stand.
3,"Cuts the pop, but not much else","While this does cut pops, it's primary focus, the mount itself is rather filmsy. It doesn't hold terribly well and the screw holding it to the mount allows for the filter to drop depending on how you're trying to position it."
2,It developed a run...,I've had this filter for 4 months and it started developing a run that is slowly widening and spreading all the way across. I think these things may be fragile by nature since they look like pantyhose material.
2,Poor build,You would think the engineers behind this pop filter would have known that the weight of the pop filter should be able to be supported by the goose neck. Whenever I set the pop filter to its correct height the weight of the filter makes the goose neck bend further throwing off the alignment. Cheap filter with cheap results. The filter does work when its in position. Good luck getting it there though.
2,CRAPPY DONT BUY,"ITs not worth it. I bought it and it came in crappy packaging, and after leaving it for like a day, i returned to find holes as if the fabric was too stretched. Very poorly made...Would NOT recommend."
2,Crappy Box,I bought this pop filter for my boyfriend for his b-day and the pop filter packaging looked very worn. Overall I'm displeased with its appearance. As for the product it self wouldn't know as of right now.
1,"okay, except the fact SCREEN IS A BIT TORN","I just received the product. shipping was fast. product sealed in the plastic box.The product fits well to the microphone stand. The screw-holder holds the body well.However, PART OF THE THE SCREEN IS RIPPED out of the box.Buyers BEAWARE."
3,"Not bad, but there's better values out there","I'm a newbie to vocal recording. I knew I needed something like this with a Condenser mic, but didn't know anything about gear brands. Right after I bought this online (I'm way too used to shopping online), I decided to go see what was available at a local music store. There were much higher quality pop filters on sale there for about the same price.There's nothing particularly wrong with this, but the nylon arrived a little shabby, and the metal neck is weak (doesn't hold it's position very well)."
3,The Product is Very Flimsy,"Overall, it is a good product but I would not buy it a second time. It gets the job done, the one that I received was very flimsy it would not stay in place."
2,Damaged goods sold as though they are NEW,Item was NOT new and NOT in working order and in fact was damaged. There were marks on the flexible arm where it connects to the clamp as though someone had tried to loosen or tighten the connection --- which I discovered as I was examining the item trying to figure out why it would not stay put in the same place I moved the flexible arm. Very disappointed that a damaged product (that was CLEARLY pre-owned)like this would be sent out. Have to use TAPE to get it to work how it should be working.
4,filter,for the price we paid it's a pretty good pop filter ... but should be better for the filter part ... it was delivered on time and it was relatively cheap . it's adjustable... and relatively well made
1,Not worth it,"You might as well buy some thick wire, make a circle about 6"" wide, and stretch 2 layers of nylon over it tightly. Thats how poorly made this product is. If youre going for the look of something professional then I guess its worth it, but if youre just looking for something that works and filters the ""pop"" sounds then just make your own, dont waste your money. This product is not worth $15 or even $20 and can be easily made at home."
3,Decent but nothing special,This pop filter definitely works but the neck of isn't very strong and doesn't stay in place half of the time.
3,"It's OK, weak arm.","Does what it's supposed too but the arm it is on does not work well, at least the one I have anyway. Near the base that you use to connect to other things the arm is rather weak, and my one at least will not offer much support and starts to slowly drop downwards. I can overcome the problem but am disappointed that it does not offer better support for such a long neck."
3,"Not Bad, Could Be Better","This is a pretty good filter, but like someone else mentioned, it's a little weak when it comes to holding itself up. I bought the filter for use with the Blue Snowball and sometimes, it just goes flopping all over the place. So, it's a good filter as far as getting rid of most of the ""pop"", but I can only give it 3 stars because it's just not as sturdy as I'd like it to be & the clamp that attaches it to the microphone stand sticks out quite a bit, but it'll do for now."
2,"""inexpensive"" junk",The screen fell out as soon as I pulled it free from the packaging. I have had to rig the thing to keep it together. I probably should've just made my own with a wire hanger and stockings. Everything else kinda works. The clamp clamps and the adjustable arm allows for just that.
3,it's alright,"The part that attaches to the stand, gives in. It buckles. The screen is loose and will easily fall out."
4,Decent Pop Filter,"It does what it's supposed to do. It's as well made as most, I think. They all look cheap to me, unless you get a studio professional grade. The screen pops out easily, but it will pop back in. It works well for my home recording."
4,"It's necessary, so get one already!","A needed accessory for any vocal recording, period. My only gripe about this model is why the straight bracket part needs to stick out so dang far, since you can bend the arm out in any position anyway."
4,It makes a difference. How much? Check out the video for a comparison,"Length:: 0:59 MinsThe video review compares audio samples, with and without the filter, recorded using aBlue Microphones Snowball USB Microphone (White). It also includes some observations on this excellent product.2+ year update: I've had the pop filter clamped to my Snoball mic for over two years and it's still good as new. (Not surprising since it's built like a tank.)BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews, accompanied by detailed videos, can take the place of first-hand experiences that are often lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and try to return the favor as best as I can. I hope you found this review helpful and the video at least entertaining. If there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it."
1,Something Funky Going On,I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).
4,Does the job well...,"Great quality and construction. Does it's job well. Only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline. These bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy. Overall, stays in place and does it's job well. A workhorse for sure."
2,Over Priced,There are many competitors to this product with similar functionality. This one (and other similar products) is over priced compared to the material and technology used to manufacture the product.
5,Lovving it,My B's and P's Finally don't pop!Great quality materialLight very light.It fits perfectly with my microphone stand but it slides around sometimes no matter how tight I tighten it too.
4,Pop Filter,I used to have such trouble with popping my 'P's until I tried out this Pop Filter. It really makes a difference in how my words are projected and still lets all of the sound come through. This product really makes a big difference with external microphones.
2,The box has been opened before,I opened the box and i noticed that its been opened before. i see this because there were staples holding it together.
1,PS Solomon,"The thing seems to function as intended, but it wasn't shrink-wrapped? There were just two Staples along the top of the plastic packaging. Really? How unprofessional is that? I'm not certain whether this is indicative of the seller or Amazon as a whole, but I'm guessing the latter because I've purchased several things on Amazon that are in this state. Secondly, the packaging was dirty (scratched and beat up) and there were a multitude of bits of thread/string inside the packaging (initially, I thought it was hair). Wow, next time, I'm going to a retail location."
4,Vanilla Cake Mix,"The cake is quite good, the price was great. However, you need to watch the experation date on box as it was past the date to be used. I still found it to be very fresh and usuable."
4,Useful for teachers needed to add in music,"These games are great for using music to stimulate thinking, planning and connecting with emotional response. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS BOOK if you are looking for ideas around a progressive (building each week on previously learned) music skills education curriculum. It is great for incorporating music, rhythm and sound into everyday teaching environment."
4,Actually pretty good!,"The book is small and the instructions are brief, but the book has some good games in it. I would especially recommend the book for Elementary School Teachers, who want to include some music games in the curriculum."
2,Just didn't meet my needs,"I'm sure that this is a great resource for some, but for me, this did not help with the goal of trying to adapt lessons in a church setting for a weekly 15 minute game session. I actually only found two games out of the 101 that I could effectively adapt for the goals of three rotating sessions (games, instruments, and singing) for children music ministry ages four through fouth grades."
3,Games,"There are a lot of ideas for games in this book. I wouldn't quite call it 101 games though because there are 4 music quizzes involved & the answers aren't even provided - they actually require the teacher to do some research. Ex: ""Name the song that sold the greatest # of records last year and the group that recorded it."" Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't sound like a game. Most of the games I've used out of the book, I've tweaked to make them work for me & my students. I haven't had a lot of luck with older kids (grades 6-8). Also, some of the descriptions don't make a whole lot of sense. Overall, not a bad book though. It's helped out quite a bit on ""music game day""."
3,Not for Parents,"This book has some great ideas for classes or large groups, but if you're looking for music games and activities to do at home with just one or two kids, it's the wrong book."
3,Okay,The activities are very simple to implement and easy to understand. This book is geared more towards classroom teachers. It used some terminology that those who are not musically trained may fins slightly confusing.
4,"Good book, not as musical as I thought.","This is a good book for music teachers to have, but don't expect to use all 101 games. Many are variations on a theme, are impratical in the classroom, or simply are not very musical. An example of this is a game where students have to act out the titles of songs, like Charades. Sure, it'd probably be fun, but it's hard to say what the students are actually learning about music from that. I'd say there's 10-15 games I think I might use - or leave for a sub to use. I also would modify most of them to make them more appropriate for a limited classroom space."
2,Not as useful as I'd thought.,"After reading the raving reviews I ordered the book - I needed ideas and help because I'm a music teacher who is now teaching elementary music, yet I had limited experience in that area. I couldn't afford the Kodaly books, so I thought this would be a good start.What a disappointment! A lot of the games involve blindfolding the students, which isn't appropriate in classrooms anymore, especially because most elementary music classes will have 20-30 kids, no matter what size the school. On top of that, the games don't actually involve the kids singing much - there are rhythm games, but good ones are very few.Overall, this book seems very outdated in it's ideas and games. It wasn't a wise investment for me."
2,not that many good classroom music games,"I borrowed this book to get some ideas for my K - 5th grade classroom music students. I have around 30 students per class and I found that this book had limited usability for me. There were some good ideas, some that just wouldn't work, and some that weren't really that focused on music. I think that out of all 101 games, I only really liked about half a dozen. Not enough of a resource for me to want to purchase the book for myself."
5,Funtastic,Music is fun for play and doesn't always have to be taken so seriously. These well thought-out games are adaptible for so many different moods integrating the rhythum and beauty of auditory art into activity for kids.
5,Worth every penny!,"I can't beleive I'm spending this much for 64 oz of laundry detergent, but I'll do so gladly again and again! This was given to me as a gift and the scent is so lovely I had to go online and order more. I use it for all my son's clothes, my unmentionables and on occasion our bedsheets for a treat. The stain remover is also great and I will buy that once mine has run out. Do keep in mind that it is a high efficiency detergent for high efficiency machines, so you don't have to use very much for a load."
4,Great for baby clothes and bedding!,"I couldn't disagree with the previous reviewer. I love Caldrea's Sweet Pea laundry detergent. It's designed to be used for baby and children's items, and always leaves my baby's clothes and bedding clean and smelling fresh with a very lightly sweet scent. I find comfort in knowing that the ingredients are all natural and safe for baby. Some dark or bright stains require further attention than just a throw in the wash, but otherwise I've been very happy with this product."
1,Horrible,"This product smells nice in the bottle. I was excited when it arrived. I had a blanket with some fresh dirt stains from the dog jumping on the bed. Took the blanket right away and washed it in Caldrea Lavender Pine detergent. I added the fabric softener of the same scent. While in the washing machine ( new HE LG machine) the detergent smelled great. I took the blanket out and voila- not only it didn't retain any of the scent, but all the dirt stayed exactly where it was. So I had to rewash the blanket in Era. And the cheap old boring Era washed the blanket sparkling clean and smelling fresh.This detergent and fabric softener is not worth the money."
4,Caldrea laundry,"If you are buying strictly for the scent, lovely when wet, scent completely disappears when dry. Biodegradable natural ingredients does a good job of cleaning all fabrics, low sudsing quality, wish the bottle was larger. Again the scent is quite lovely, you will enjoy doing the wash."
3,VERY light...,"A bit thinner than I was expecting...it does say it is featherweight and it means it! I dont feel there was anything wrong with the product I just had never purchased the ""featherweight"" before."
3,Not what I excepted,Not bad but not what I was really looking for. May need to purchase hand held joy stick forbetter play.
4,Nikon Luminosi sun glasses,I am pleased with this product.. the look and feel is freat.. I had a pair of Nikon's before..but this takes the cake... a master build..
5,"Heinleins BEST Novel, A Must Read For Any Teenager!","The second American Revolution, showing how the individual is empowered to change things for the better. A complete demonstration of the affects and effects of Religon and Politics on each other Society in general and People in particular. This gripping novel will keep you on the edge of your seat to its ironic ending."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Another part of Heinlein's archetypal 'Future History' covering takeover of government by hardcore religious orders, and that sort of thing, along with moving out into solary system engineering projects.A little more sophisticated, perhaps.Revolt in 2100 : If This Goes On - Robert A.

4,A lot of fun...,"This game is a lot of fun. Lots of dogfighting and ground targets to destroy, along with some tricky missions. Replays are cool, but in-game movies are cheesy and the gun sound fx are completely unsatisfying. The programmers might argue the sounds are true to life, but I'm much more interested in high drama for a more entertaining experience. But other than that, I liked the controls, the various planes, and the different weaponry. I'm not entirely sure the buy and sell options for planes and weapons is necessary.I haven't had the chance to play 2-player, and I bet that'd be great fun. If you're someone who sits and plays games for a weekend straight, pick this up used or as a rental. Its 18 missions offer under 25 hours of gameplay, I'd guess (playing the same mission over and over doesn't count)."
4,better than average,"The graphics are pretty cool,and control is excellent...the only thing that kept it from being a 5* game is the fact it's so short...the 18 missions were just not long enough,and i beat it in about 7hrs of total gameplay!"
5,excellent game!!,this is the most realistic air combat game that I have ever played!! the graphic is awsome and missle and control of the plane are realistic. recommand buy item!.
3,East meats West,"This is one of the few flight sim fixes you can get on the PS2, but flight sim fans be warned, this is not a true flight sim. It's a bit ""arcadie"" to be a sim.I liked this game right up to the second to the last battle. The whole ""Megalith"" thing rubbed me the wrong way. In fact, so did the Stone Henge thing too. I would have prefered more realistic campaignes.What it comes down to is this is a warning for flight sim fans to rent this title first."
3,Fun... but over (and over) too quickly,"The graphics and controls are great while the audio really blows away any other flight game I've played. However, the game can be played through in a matter of hours and it does get rather repetitive bombing and bombing and bombing...I highly recommend this game - for a weekend rental."
3,Worth a rental,"Ace Combat 04 has a lot of eye candy and looks great. Unfortunately, the flight model is way too simple for this game to be anything but an updated Galaga.Literally, there is a button to go fast, slow, up, down, left and right. Stalls, spins, damage, etc aren't part of this game. Namco has put in carrier and airstrip landings, but they are ridiculously simple and offer no challenge at all.The first time I played, for example, I finished about 4 missions in an hour. I made a perfect carrier landing on one mission despite my plane being at 94% damage. Not bad for a rookie in a beat up prayer of an airplane, or, just a very very simple arcade interface.Some missions are tedious - score 2000 points in 11:00 minutes for example. It's fun blowing up the first 20 land targets, then boredom sets in. Besides the time limitations on some missions, the most challenging part to the game is not hitting the ground."
3,"ace combat 4, or is it 3.","I was hoping it would have huge improvements on PS2. The game plays just like the first, with better visuals. That is about it, for the money, you would be better off renting it. You could beat all the missions in a weekend."
4,Ace Combat 4 Is Da Best!!!,"This game is one of the best flying games ever! I like the choice of planes and variety of levels, even though most are easy to beat. The loading of the game takes only a couple of seconds. If you enjoy playing flying simulation games, Ace Combat 4 would be a good game for you.The only negative thing I have to say about the game is the fact that the missions could take up to 45 minutes and the Yellow Squadron is almost impossible to shoot down. The plane names get confusing, because they use numbers instead of the plane's actual names. Otherwise, this game is #1!!!"
4,Rating of 95/100,"ok listen up people this game is hot, actually not just hot, its blazin. the only reason i take 5 points away is because if you blow up a plane from close up, it looks kinda weird, it dowsnt look fuzzy or anything, its just not explody enough. and yes the ground does look weird from close up but thats the price u have to pay for great graphics, great sound that it perfect for each mission, and AWESOME planes that have perfect graphics. theirs a nice selection of graphics, and you dont have to go and land and take-off every 5 mins for running out of ammo. i love how when you shoot down a plane, it catches on fire and goes spiraling down and explodes on the ground!! GREAT GAME!!"
5,This game is why everyone should buy a ps2,"Full of detailed graphics, smooth flight controls, and challenging missions, this game is one you will play over and over again. Once you've mastered and defeated the game on the normal difficulty, you have an uncontrollable urge to go back and beat hard, expert, and ace; not only to unlock more fighters but just to prove you can outfly and out dogfight every pilot you go against. This is the best flying game out yet, it beats Top Gun, Lethal Skies, and Dropship by 150%. If you own a PS2 this game HAS to be in your collection of games."
4,Best fighter game ever,"This game is the coolest fighter game out there. Nothing matches its graphics and story line. Must have for any gamer, big or small talent. Only down side is I beat it in 5 hours."
4,Pass Grandma's oxygen please!!,"I can now understand why the commercial for this game has the guy taking Grandma's O2. This is definitely a thrill to play. The graphics are great and quite believable, and the controls are pretty good too. I have only two complaints with the game...Those damn voices (radio traffic) get pretty annoying after extended play, (just like they did in the other editions) and the text print of the radio traffic obscures the compass on the HUD. I could have also done without the little story thing in between missions. The story line is good, but if you're going to use it, spend the time and do an actual full-motion cut scene, don't just paste a static picture in front of me and then tell me a story.Those things kept me from giving it 5 stars, but this is definitely one to have on your shelf."
5,Awesome graphics in a great game,"A must have for the player of the air combat genre.Everything about this game was done perfectly. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is exactly what you'd come to expect from the 4th edition of the series.However, the 2 player mode is very lacking. The inability to change the view while playing with another person can almost ruin it for anyone who prefers the other views.I like the game so much that I played it through on all difficulties to get enough cash to unlock ever single plane (Including the awesome X-02)."
4,"Overall, a pretty good game.","I played Ace Combat 2 on playstaion, and even played ac 3 (japanese version). Both were pretty good. So when ac4 came out, I eagerly preordered. Graphics (3.5): the game itself is pretty good. However, I don't know why, but plane/weapon selection screens are dark, and a bit confusing. Sound (4) : accoustically, it's decent. Music is a bit lame (not enough guitar riff- metal/hard rock core) for my taste. Game play (4.5): I haven't completed it yet, but like ac2 and ac3, the game play itself will draw you to the game. Controls (4.5): take a little bit of adjustment. It took me about 20 minutes of game play to adjust to the controls. The good thing is it comes with a tutorial, so you can train yourself before going on the missions. Overall (4.2): this games did not disappoint me."
2,tedious video game,"I used to play a game called Chuck Yeager's Air Combat. The graphics stunk compared to this game, but now I know that the gameplay is what matters, because although the graphics on this game can be very nice, the game is very boring. The cut scenes are unbearable to watch or even skip through. The missions are too easy and not interesting enough. Your wingmen are completely useless, which is too bad because some of the missions where you basically have to bomb dozens of targets would be more interesting if you didn't have to bomb each and every one yourself."
4,a great game but the language is bad,"This is another fun air combat sim. Cool storymode and missions. Provide Air-to-ground support in some missions. Or take out enemy ships but watch out for the SAMS( Surface to Air Missils)On some missions you must provide cover for a pedestrian ship and taking out radio jamming towers.The only thing bad about this game is the Language. On your radio they swear at least once every 3 min. Overall a good game. Why I rate this 4 not 5 is the story mode is kind of short. and 2 player mode is not much fun to play. At first the controls of this game are hard but it gets easier. This game is one of those games where the screen rolls around and makes you sick. Even after I play for about an hour I get to feel sick, and I am really good at handiling with things like that."
2,Doesn't belong on the,"This is a decent fighter game but by no means is it at the PC level. Its very limited with such things like landings being optional and the ability to just fly off the map to reload.Timed missions are annoying, sometimes you want to just fly around after the mission, and destroy more targets, but you can't because the times up and the mission is over.Cut scenes are ultra-cheesy illustrations and a dumb story.Different airplanes don't behave that differently. Flight physics model is not that great.I beat the game on normal in a day and a half. I wish I rented it first."
2,Top Gun for NES Revisited...,"This game reminds me of ""Top Gun"" for the original Nintendo console.Its a button masher, one button to fire your cannon and another to lock-on/fire your missiles. (And somehow, your aircraft is capable of carrying 50+ missiles.)In short, its an arcade shoot 'em up game.No functioning fire control computer, no true MDU's, no NAV aids, no ATC integration, no anything that one would expect to find in an aircraft. You simply just ""fly"" and fire your 50+ missiles.The flight model? Well, the aircraft fly like Star Wars spacecraft. You can't even stall the aircraft if you try."
3,dissapointed,"I played this game half year ago, and I have to say for me, an ace combat 3 fan, this game comes as a bit of dissapointment. Not that it's not good or anything, it's just not as good as I expected it would be. For one thing, it does not has a fasinating storyline as ac3 had. The players cannot interact with the world like what we did in ac3, we merely see the story unravels from two points of view, and the story is really way too simple. And the result is the game is really short, you can beat it under 10 hours if you have played its predecessor or you are an experienced gamer"
5,OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME,"One word for this games is ""BREATH TAKING"". I'll be honest I don't know much about the story but I know its deep and well thought off. All I know is your flying a superb jet plane fully loaded and there is a made up island which is having problems and you are sent in. The graphics are lovely and fantastic. The PS2 shows off its graphics capability. Which are impressive. I strongly recomend this. Get this..."
3,Not a bad game,I went out and bought the game the day it came out. It turns out that it is a great game but it also has a major short fall. It is way to EASY!!!! Even on the hardest setting I cleared it in a few hours. Take that away it a great game
4,Very cool!,"This game is so much fun! I highly recommend it. It doesn't take too long to complete. It only took me about 2 weekends off and on to finish. Unlocking the different planes and color schemes is way cool. But be sure to pick the right plane for the right mission. I remember trying some missions and they were tough until I picked the right plane with the right weapons. I recommend getting an online walkthrough in order to purchase the best planes for each mission in the first run through. You can always buy the other planes later. So if you enjoy flying games and war games, then you will love this because you get both in one. Have fun!"
4,Very good Album,"I ordered this CD to add to my Ranma 1/2 collection since I got plenty of room in my new home now. This CD has been on my mind for a long time, and getting a copy is a treat - a very rare CD to find nowadays. I knew the album was in Japanese (it's obviously since the show is Japanese, and character song album is just made in Japan only), and enjoy each song pretty good. Some are nice and calm music, and others are full of energy. Overall, it's a good album for any Ranma 1/2 fan."
4,Awsome songs,"Hey who cares if it's in japanese and you can't understand? These are some great songs whether you know what the words are or not! You can still tell who's singing and make pretty good guesses of what they're basically saying. And if you want to know exactly what they're saying, you can just go to ... some other site that has all the translations. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because there are 1 or 2 songs that I didn't absolutely LOVE. The rest were all great! Oh yeah, and you probably shouldn't get it if you haven't seen the show, but then why would you even be reading this review if you haven't?"
3,Ranma 1/2 Song Calendar,"I didn't like this CD because it was in Japanese. If you like Japanese songs, buy the CD."
2,Very slow delivery,"I ordered this plate in plenty of time to have it by the time I needed it for a projector installation. I was promised two-day delivery, but I guess they waited a week before they decided to ship it 2nd day. At any rate, I had to buy another plate locally at a higher price to get the job done. Now I have a plate that I don't need. Anyone need a frisby??"
3,Super soft but small.,My six year old niece loved this little seal. It was a gift for her and I loved how super soft it was...extremely. Yet I was also surprised at how little it was. Very small for a stuffed animal I thought. But still cute :)
1,false advertising,Ordered the book for my son. It had the picture of the DVD and dive chart so I ordered it. When it arrived neither was with the book. Had to ship it back the next day. FALSE AD.
2,Open Water Diver Manual,The book was a used item so I didn't expect it to be in perfect shape. It was cheap and in a shape that was OK. I can live the written remarks in the book - but I think it should have been mentioned in the ad. Worse was that on the picture in the ad a CD and dive tables were shown - they were not included when the book arravied. Disappointing!
3,Nice Solid Collection of Rock Instrumentals for Completists,"A nice roundup of rock instrumentals from 1961 to 1966 - no hidden gems though and certainly none of the classic rock or surf guitar tracks. This one is really for instrumental completists (or people who enjoy rock bands with names that just scream from the early 1960's such as: The Checkmates, Sons of the Piltdown Men or Mike Ford and the Consuls :-)(There is one track from the Dave Clark Five)All the tracks are fun, the musicianship all professional and the sound quality is surprisingly good."
3,For the curious.,"I found the book very interesting to read but not to believe. i don‘think i will be recommending it to any of my friends, most of them could never accept it."
1,Not Dantes Friendly,"I purchased this book, brand new, online for the purpose of obtaining the knowledge I needed to take a DANTES test. I found that the book consisted of the writings of philosophers and not narration of the philosopher's beliefs. The anicient writings are incredibly difficult to decipher. I ended up having to locate another source from a library and tossing this book into the dumpster! If I had not gotten the secondary source of information I would have been lost during the test."
3,Great Textbook for Music Lover's,I bought this book for a college music history class. 3 years later I still own it because it has a lot of information about how different genres of music gave birth to new genres since the turn of the 20th century. I discovered new artists that I now feature in my Itunes list.I rated 3 stars because I felt like it was too general in areas and that was a huge disappointment.
1,Worst book I have ever had for any class,"This book is just horrible all around. First of all he jumps around from one musician to the next without sometimes giving even any small details about them, their songs or albums would be nice!He jumps around too much from one genre to the next, it is frustrating.My next problem was that for the price you pay for this skinny book you should at least get a CD with the songs he gives details about. All he does is recommend you go to ITunes!! Why not just tell people to go to Project Playlist, at least that's free.The most annoying thing is that I love music and this book made me hate the class, I kept wanting to rip it to pieces it is written so badly!!Don't buy this book if you can avoid it."
3,awesome product,This is a test review which is needed for C7Y r8n script. This product is really good and will be voted on
2,Strontium 90 - 'Police Academy' (Ark 21),"Anyone remember Mike Howlett?He was bassist for the band Gong until he left in 1977.Within that same timespan he just happen to bring together an unknown singer (we now) know as Sting together with drummer Stewart Copeland and guitarist Andy Summers to play on his demo.Strontium 90 was a short lived band but they did manage to perform at a large hippie festival in Paris in May,1977 where the three live tracks on this release was taped,""Three O'Clock Shot"",""Electron Romance"" and ""Lady Of Delight"".The ONLY Police cut on here you're likely to recognize is ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"".The only other decent tunes here are ""Visions Of The Night"" and ""Towers Tumbled"" because they do feature Sting's trademark vocals.I was pretty dissapointed with 'Police Academy' mostly for the reason is that it just SEEMS that it could've been so much better.On the upside,however if you happen to be a MAJOR Police nut,you may very well enjoy it.Nice cover,though."
2,Recorded motor noise spoils otherwise superb camera,"After researching the digital camcorder field for three years, I decided this camera looked like the best in the less-than-$400 market. The camcorder performed magnificently for me for the three weeks I had it and it has an extraordinary feature set for the money. However, the motor emits an extremely annoying noise which is captured on the tape and sounds like you were recording everything in a machine shop. On going back to the Internet and researching other reviews, I found that this is a very common problem with this camera. So sad! I loved this camera, but the recorded motor whine killed what was otherwise a 5-star camcorder."
2,Good video quality but horrible sound distortion,The video quality on this camera was great but all that was ruined by a VERY VERY loud tape drive. The sound coming from the MiniDV tape drive was so loud that it was picked up by both the built-in microphone AND an external microphone placed a good 5-6 inches from the unit. The distortion was so bad I returned the camera. Canon needs to address this issue as I have been reading about this a lot lately. Let the buyer beware with this camera.
1,Tape drive noise makes this camcorder unusable,"I got this because cnet recommended it as the best budget camcorder. Unfortunately, the microphone picks up the whirring of the tape drive while it records. During playback the whirring on the tape is so loud it makes the video unwatchable. If you've ever watched an old silent movie on a projector and can remember all of the noise that the projector makes, well that's the level of noise that gets recorded to your tape.I returned mine and would not recommend this one."
1,Motor Noise Ruined It,"The motor noise that is picked up when recording is absolutely unbearable. Unless you plan on watching the video muted, don't bother with this camcorder."
2,Heed the motor noise warnings!,"What is the story with the motor noise on the Elura 100?! I just don't understand how this product made it through the design/production process with such an obvious defect. Perhaps the annoying noise is louder in some units than others - that's the only explanation I can come up with for how many 5 star reviews are posted here.I love the features, size and image quality of the Elura 100 and am a huge Canon fan. But, like the people who posted negative reviews here, I just don't think I can live with such a loud hum as background noise to all my videos. Some reviewers say the noise is only audible if you film in a quiet room, but that's not my experience at all. I just made a short video on the sidewalk by a busy street and the noise is too annoying to ignore.Like another reviewer here, I was impressed by the # of positive reviews and ignored the warnings about the motor noise. If I could find the exact same camera, minus the noise, I'd buy it. But this one's no good."
2,"Canon Elura 100~ wow, the whirring noise is overpowering!","I just received the canon elura from Butterfly Photo and am promptly returning it for another. I hope not to have the same issue with the motor noise, but the one they sent was terrible. I recorded for about five minutes and the replay on both the camera and T.V. was very noticable and problematic. I went to Best Buy to hear their floor model and did not hear anything compared to what this camera's motor noise was emitting. Did Butterfly Photo send me a refurbished camera? It seems that there have been various reports of this issue. Obviously, some of the cameras do not have the motor noise problem, while others clearly do. Butterfly promptly sent another camera without the motor noise. Thanks!!"
4,Keep an open mind,"I have now owned this camera for 7 months and have used it extensively. From the previous reviews you can see that while some camera's may have some sound issues this is hardly standard. I for one have had absolutely no sound issues. The picture quailty is very good outside or in a brightly lit room. As with any camera in this price range it will struggle in low light situations. For the price you will not find a better more compact camera. Amazon has a great return policy...if you end up with one that is too ""noisy""...return it."
4,Better than my old VHS-C,"Have used mine about a week. Picture plenty crisp and clear, even in lower light. Don't know how low folks are complaining about, but it performs fine indoors, at night, with the lights on. Daylight through open windows provides plenty of light, but then I've got a lot of windows; ) Autofocus plenty responsive and smart enough to pick out the main subject. 20X optical zoom more than enough.Wee bit of motor noise, but far from 'nails on chalkboard'. Using the analog to digital pass through (which works no problem with iMovie) I've noticed more motor noise on my old Panasonic VHS-C camcorder's tapes.Ergonomics are a bit wonky for my big hands, camera is kind of 'boxey' but it is more than manageable.Can't comment on still pics as I haven't, and probably never will, use it for that. Overall I'd definitely recommend it. Just recently purchased the Lowepro Edit 110 bag and it will fit this camcorder, it's accessories, a spare battery and two spare tapes, all snugly and securely."
5,Unbelieveable for under $350!,"Quite simply you can't touch anything this good for the price. Great picture (real 16:9), great features, good still shooting. If you want a better camcorder (and there are better ones) you will need to spend about $500 to get anything comparable. I did a lot of research. For $500-$600 you can get an quite fablulous camcorder (better than this model) but there is nothing close to Canon Elura 100 in its price range which is why I'm giving it 5 stars."
5,Canon Elura 100,"When I went Camcorder shopping, I looked at all the reviews I could find. My final choices were the Canon Elura 100 and the JVC GRD-650.The reason for this is that these were the only 2 camcorders with 3 ccd's that were priced under $500. I never got to actualy see the JVC model in the stores, so I bought the Canon. I'm very pleased with it. I have some spectacular images of our cruise ship leaving Aruba at night. My experience with Amazon.com was Fabulous. The camera even came a day before the expected delivery date, and I live in a small town in Puerto Rico. This is a first rate product with first rate service. THANKS!"
2,"Elura 100 ""Remove Cassette"" errror""","This is the most unreliable camera I've ever owned. I've owned a Sony and a JVC but wanted to try out the DV format (both of my old ones were 8mm). The infamous ""remove cassette"" error is persistent after 2 yrs. I was told that I am among the lucky few to have used it that long. I don't want to make this up, yes I was ""happy"" for 2 yrs. But does 2 yrs equate to ""Canon reliability"". I am in the market for a camera whose manufacturer name does not start with a ""C""."
4,Great Little Camcorder,"After putting my 10 year old Sony to rest, this camcorder is a real treat.Easy to use, very portable and fun. The only negative is that the little flap to access the memory storage card and back up battery is so flimsy and poorly attached by a single hinge that it is sure to snap off at some time. Otherwise, highly recommend."
2,Too much motor noise comes through on playback,"I just purchased this camcorder and I will make two observations supporting what many others have stated- both here and in other reviews. The motor noise is for real. The noise I am getting is a high pitched motor/ tape transport noise that is annoying while shooting and a major problem on playback. There is also a lower pitched constant rumble that combines with the high pitched noise to really ruin the playback experience. I tested this in different environments, and it is clearly the camcorder and not any surrounding noises.The only other negative thing that other reviews mention and that I will confirm is that it is, for me, an uncomfortable camcorder to hold. Try before you buy. If it were not for the motor noise I could live with the way it is held.Other than that, this is a great little camcorder. Too bad about the noise."
4,I'm very satisfied,"The experts had a lot of good things to say about this camera, so I bought one.I would recommend this camera to anyone who intends to transfer their footage to a computer for (even small amounts of) editing and eventual transfer to DVD.The still images, while of decent quality (especially with respect to the price of the camera) are not great. The still images appear to be highly sensitive to hand motion."
2,Avoid this if you can,"I am sorely disappointed with this camcorder. Its lighting is not only poor -its erratic !! Sometimes at whatever angle I record, even in bright light, the resulting picture has unpredictable dark and bright lighting. This camera is just not worth it. The rewind and forward operations are plain frustrating. JVC wins hands down anyday!"
5,Such a blessing,"I am currently deployed to an undisclosed location and I ordered this camera, but had it sent to my wife back home. She recorded a full tape of my son, my parents, her parents, and herself before sending it my way. It was such a good surprise and what a blessing. The picture quality is amazing and it is also so easy to use."
3,It's fine for the money,"The camera is fine for the money you pay, but I'm not that happy with it over all. The motor noise in the recording is ridiculously loud. The picture is not nearly as good as the Sony I had before this though. If your looking for a camera under $400, this has some nice features, but if your looking for quality picture, you could do better."
2,Too noisy,"My camera was too noisy to handle when I tried to watch it on the computer(my luck?)but was not as noticable on TV; the quality of night shots is just poor, I couldn't understand the purpose of the LED light; after converting the film onto a DVD film, the film was way too fuzzy for my taste (remember that the camera comes with a basic program); I was able to take much better short films on my SD630 than this camera; I had to return it. I guess it was okay for others."
4,"Good product, good price","Good value/price. picture colors are good, sound is ok but need an external micro."
4,Great from word work!,I am really happy with these stamps. I plan on using them for the Daily 5 word work next year in my classroom. They come in a nice storage case. It is easy to determine which letter is which stamp. I think my students will really enjoy using these.
2,"Lots of projects, but not enough dye info","This book is 110 pages and most of it is taken up by detailed descriptions of various moderate and advanced multi-colored dyeing projects. The important information on the various types of dyes and basic dyeing techniques is brief. Since the book was published in 1988, many of the brands of dyes and sources are no longer valid. If you are looking for a book that will tell you the best dyes and current brands to use on various natural and synthetic fabrics and blends, this book isn't it. It is fine if you can buy the book for $5 or just want some dyeing project ideas. However, for fabric dyeing fundamentals, there are better, newer books. There is also a lot of information now available on the Net and on the dye manufacturers' web sites about dyeing techniques and the brands to use for various fabrics."
5,Beautiful and moving pictures of Mexico City,"I really loved this book. It has black and white photos of different areas of Mexico City, all taken by Mexican children. It also includes captions for each picture in Spanish and English. I lived in Mexico a long time ago and ""Picture Mexico City"" really captured the soul of the city, and the Mexican spirit. The Getty Conservation Institute is contributing so much to the world and its children with the ""Picture"" project, and I hope they can continue it with other cities."
5,mandala,"although a bit heavy for daily wear, this necklace has a powerful feeling when worn. the low price and high value make this purchase an A+++"
1,review of simply wild,This is the worst book that I've read in a very long time. The book was more mystery than romance and a complete waste of my time and money. The author did not capture or keep my attention.
1,Simply Wild,"This was the worst book I have read so far this year. The story moved at a fast pace, I had to go back to re-read pages to understand what was going on in the story. Their was not enough romance, it was basically about a guy trying to clear his name for a murder he did not commit. It should have been a suspence novel instead of a romance novel. The other Simply... books in this series was the same way."
1,Not a Good Book at All,"This is my first time reading a Shelby Lewis book and I am sad to say that I stopped reading it after the 3rd chapter, had to put it down and pick it up . I could not get into the story at at all. It seemed to me to start off too dull and the meeting of Holly and Jake was boring and not interesting at all. He came to pick up some lace from her shop and I didnt feel the sparks fly at all. There was no build up to their meeting and I didnt feel any familiarity with them to really be happy about them meeting and going on a date so soon. Not a good book at all for me. I hope there are other better Shelby Lewis books around."
5,Love this collection,"Her voice goes from bluesy to 20's. (I can picture her in a speak easy!)Her songs are playful to thought provoking.I'm not a fan of female vocals, as they usually sound like they are whining to me.Lari has a pure easy listening voice."
4,Fun Record - Great Singer - Bluesey Edge - I LIKE IT,"My friend Dave took a look at this record and said ""Larry, Huh?"" -- Sure you might not be familiar with Lari White but you'll probably enjoy this record - It has some great songwriting and is filled with lovely bluesey soft country gems - and Lari's voice is controlled and very very pretty. She's one of those who should've been more noticed! Very fine playing and singing on the fun title track, and the rest is a mix of soulful soft melodic tunes framing Lari's perfect tone and a bit of upbeat fancy foot-shuffling hotties! Check it out!"
4,Good size,"I like these bowls because of their depth and how much they hold. I would have given five stars but I had trouble when I received them getting them apart. Two were stuck so tight I didn't think I would ever get them apart. I tried heating the bottom one with hot water (to expand it) and putting cooler water in the top one. I tried putting them in water in the microwave. My husband suggested oiling them and when I sprayed cooking oil generously around the rim of the lower one they came apart right away. Also, after I ordered these, I found the plain white ones cheaper and with no shipping at our local Walmart. Plain white would have been fine with me and I would have bought those if I had seen them first."
4,Bowels,"Product was what I expected. However, there was no bubble wrap on any of the bowels and one was broken."
4,RAW&MESSY.-EVERYTHING NEW YORK HARDCORE WAS ABOUT.,"I HAD THIS ONE ON CASSETTE, AND NOW ON CD. IT'S A MUST HAVE FOR ANY HARDCORE/PUNK COLLECTION ESPECIALLY NYHC.ALTHOUGH I CAN RAVE ABOUT THE ALBUM FOREVER IT DOES HAVE IT'S FALTS. EVEN NOW WITH THE REMASTERD CD AVAILABLE THE ORIGIONAL RECORDING WAS A BIT LOW BUDGET SO THE SOUND QUALITY BY TODAY'S STANDARDS IS LACKING.THIS IS THE ONLY REASON THIS ONE GETS 4 OF 5 STARS.ALSO CHECK OUT JAYBIRD FOR SOME MORE GREAT TUNES FROM NYC."
2,Bah.....,"This album is completely overrated. I haven't heard the CD, but I have the vinyl from years ago. The only good song on here is ""The Edge"", which is amazing. ""Jaybird"" is MUCH better."
5,Great Item!,"The book is in perfect condition, just as I had anticipated -- no marks, scratches, or tears. I'm greatly looking forward to using it. Thank you very much!"
2,Reading for lightweights,"Yawns all around. Nothing there. The plot was weak. The characters were ineffective, even in Anderson's trying to convey their shallowness. Can't anybody sit down and write a good book anymore? Wait a minute - wait a minute...that's it! I'll do it! OK guys, gotta go... I'm gonna go write the great American novel. Just hold my mail and take a message if the phone rings. See ya in a few weeks..."
1,"Jim Cramer likes it, but I didn't","TheStreet.Com's Jim Cramer (who I admire as a trader and financial writer) plugged this book, written by a buddy, and especially mentioned the realistic portion of the book that has to do with stock trading as especially realistic - in fact based on Cramer's trading activities. But the first 150 pages or so were so affected, so pompus, so boring, so poorly written, with characters so unsympathetic and one dimensional, I had to slam the book shut unfinnished. Cramer, while I love you, stick to financial writing, not book reviews."
1,soulless and joyless,"high expectations led to a book that gives you next to no reason to read it after page 5. what a pointless vivisection of nyc-centric nothingness, no narrative momentum, just endless self-referential cleverness of zero interest to anyone who lives outside of Manhattan, and only scant interest to those who live within."
2,What was all the fuss about?,"I bought Turn of the Century because of the good publicity. The publicists exaggerated somewhat! I really can't see what all the fuss was about. I tried, and I tried and, in the end, I just had to give up on it.Sorry but this book was definitely not for me."
2,Sick reflection on our times?,"Couldn't wait to finish this book. Who cared what happened to these people. If this a reflection of the 90's generation, who is going to pay for my retirement!"
2,Very Old Plot Line,"An infidelity rehash. All done up in hipster jargon. Jealousy and suspicion are, predictably, green wounds. Ho hum!"
5,the classic novel for our era,"Kurt Andersen has written a novel that pretty much gets what this late 20th century/early 21st century is all about. Yeah, broad sweeping statement, but this book covers entertainment, culture, and the stock market with a level of dexterity we save for decathalon athletes. I know Andersen, so take it with a grain of salt, or a box if you want, but I wouldn't waste my Saturday banging out this review if I didnt think you should read this book. This is the Rosetta Stone to our culture. With the added spice of being incredibly funny. I have referred to this book more than two dozen times already in conversation and it is day three after I have finished it. Get on board and lets discuss."
5,A meditation and satire on America's media culture,"I picked up Andersen's long novel with hesitation but found it all but impossible to put down. His plotting is intricate but impeccable in terms of plausibility and every thread was quite satisfyingly resolved. His characters, down to the marginal bit players, are nailed in three dimensions. Finally, as a contemporary morality tale it will stand the test of time."
5,"A novel exploding with ideas. Rich, disturbing, very funny.","He nails it--""it"" being show business, the media, stock trading, entrepreneurial net craziness, all of it. And great characters, not cartoon stick figures like in most ""comic"" novels. Also, the subtle, careful plot blooms excitingly and hilariously in the page-turning finale."
5,THE REAL THING! A NOVEL YOU CAN READ AS WELL AS BUY....,"As reviewers line up to trash or praise this book, aren't you wondering why there is such a wide arc of disagreement? Read it and find out for yourself. There is talent shining through on every page--and yes there are a lot of pages, because its a BIG SPRAWLING WONDERFUL READ--"
5,Excellent. Awesome. Soulful and wise but also fun and funny.,"The heroes aren't perfect, and the villains aren't evil. The humor bores deep into our culture, and the dark shadows aren't nihilistic. This is just splendid, and full-bodied, and even though I'm sure he won't write a sequel I'd buy it immediately."
2,I was very disappointed,"Like others have said I also found the plot to be rather thin. Anderson is a gifted writer and I believe he will write a great novel someday. It isn't a waste of time to read, but don't expect too much."
2,"Too smug, a regrettable exhibition of poor taste","Forget this book, wait for Anderson's next one, or better yet, read one of the fine recent releases like ""East of the Mountains"" or ""The Triumph and the Glory""."
2,little more than in-phrases and product placement references,"A really disappointing effort. basically the book had no plot at all. A series of quasi-related subplots which went nowhere, and with various of the substories or themes just drifting off and disappearing. A reader would have no particular sustained interest in any of the major characters, all of whom are beautiful, talented, brilliant, wealthy and otherwise fundamentally quite secure in their privilege. I had hoped for an effort in the nature of Tom Wolfe, with the occasional line that might make you laugh out oud, but was sorely let down. Its one of those books where you realize half-way through that its actually not going pick up from there and turn into something that you will find engaging."
2,Novelization of a sitcom,"I'm halfway through this book and still waiting for something interesting to happen. Instead I keep seeing the same predictable sitcom cliche's, dressed up with a few quirky ""postmodern"" twists and swear-words. I guess the conceit here is that Anderson's characters are exactly like the silly stereotypes in the TV shows and video games that they produce. In fact, if the main character weren't missing a hand, I would have no sympathy for any of the yuppie jerks in this novel, and would be looking forward to something awful happening to the lot of them. (Perhaps the handicap was suggested by an editor who felt the same way.)"
2,"Don't buy the hype, this is trash and not good trash at that","Anderson obviously knows everyone who ""counts"" and thus this book has received an inordinate amount of hype in high-profile places. But ultimately, this is a boring book--much too long, too flatly written for all the glitzy subject matter, and ultimately a snore. He's really a Tom Wolfe wanna-be but without the dazzle. Don't buy the hype"
3,An entertaining read hampered by its excessive length,"As a media junkie, I liked this quite a bit... for a while. Toward the end, even as the plot quickens, the novel starts feeling more like an endurance event. Unlike ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" or ""A Man in Full"", this never developed into a fast read. But long stretches are immensely enjoyable, even if Andersen never gets too far beneath the surface of his characters. If you're not in too much of a hurry to get somewhere, this would be a good read for the summer."
1,Tom Wolfe it ain't,"Oh, what high expectations I had for this book, how I looked forward to settling down to a zippy rip-roaring tale of lust and greed and power in the New York media world....and what did I get? ZZZZZZZZZZZZZz....huh? Oh, srry, I nodded off. Right about page 100 of this book, actually. We all know these New Yorkers that Anderson writes about are small, vain, fussy people...so what's new? Where's the spunky Wolfeian wit? Where's the fun? Where's the heart and soul? Not here."
2,"Starts Out Great, Soon Turns Tedious","I don't know why this novel had to be 659 pages! Starts out with a bang. Loved how the author drew me into the techno/media word with the cool jargon, like Doug Coupland's GENERATION X, but unlike GEN X, this book was waaaaay too long and all the hip-slick-cool language grew tiresome and the characters grating. I didn't feel for Lizzie or George and their gimme-gimme lives and by the end---yes I read the whole damn thing, brought it to the beach with me and had no other reading material---secretly hoped that George's plane was going to crash en route to Mexico! Wouldn't recommend reading it unless you have alot of time to waste...life's too short!"
4,Great book for the turn of the century,"Sure there are plenty of comparisons to Tom Wolfe. Yes, the book may be a bit long for some. But what a great story Kurt Anderson has put together. And it finishes just as strong as it starts. Remember all the television coverage ringing in the new year? How we all became glued to the hype and hoopla? Now imagine all those TV and marketing and software execs spinning their wheels right now trying to come up with the Next Big Thing. Basically, that's where Anderson takes you with Turn of the Century. I personally liked the character of George McTier a great deal (most of the time). Harold Mose offers reminders of those media titans we all read about in the magazines and see on TV. And the world Anderson creates really isn't that far off the mark. This novel moves at top speed. And speed kills... at least careers and brain cells for some characters. A great (and long) read that kept me entertained from start to finish."
4,a big messy satire,"I can understand why so many people gave up on this book, but I can't help but feel sorry that they did. For me, Kurt Andersen wrote a novel that perfectly reflects the CNN/Fox News sound bite journalism and MTV/YouTube short attention span entertainment that rules our culture today not just with his story, but with the structure of the book. He overloads the reader with information which he repeats again and again until it finally comes together like the sections of a pointillist painting to present Andersen's very cynical and very funny view of the Information Age. It's like a mirror reflecting a mirror, reflecting a mirror, ad infinitum. I admit it's not an easy read, but if you can dance through it, you'll find a story and point of view that's unusually original, entertaining, and most definitely worthwhile. As for me, I'm off to buy Heyday."
4,Prescient and a Great Read,"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. It is reality in spades, taking you into the heart of today's digital, media, high-tech world. My only complaint, which cost it a star, was too many insider references to today's pop TV shows, which many readers won't get. Likely readers aren't of the same demographic category as those watching prime-time TV on a daily basis, I suspect. But otherwise, this is a must have."
2,No Tom Wolfe,"Interesting but the comparisons are too facile. Wolfe always had a point. In buying this book, I got carried away with all the hype. How can almost 700 pages be such worthless drivel. The only reason why I'm even giving it the two stars is because I'm in the diplomatic corps and the pop culture references are rather smart. Wait for the paperback, but for a better read, try Hometown or The Girls Guide to Fishing. Shorter and full of plot."
2,A snooze by an editor who badly needs an editor,"This isnt a novel, it's a screed with a few potted jokes, most delivered with hamhanded timing, about the author's pals in the New York media, a world that I'm sure fascinates us all. A few passages come alive, the characters never do. (Dick Tracy was more three-dimensional.) As a piece of hype, it's the literary equivalent of the movie Titanic. As a piece of literature, it's the faux-literary equivalent of the boat Titanic. Save yourself."
1,A Celebration of Shallowness,"This is a shallow, nauseating book that suffers from the very qualities it ostensibly critiques -- shallowness, emptiness, lack of values. It does capture these money-obsessed, depth-free times, but inadvertantly -- by mirroring them."
1,"A Terrible, Terrible Book","It's really awful. Trust me. Worse -- it's BORING! Satire should be funny, cutting and inventive -- not read like a bad public access comedy skit. Mr. Kurt is not a very good writer, and should not be publishing fiction of this low quality. It has many of the hallmarks of workshop writing: the clumsy sentences, the characters cribbed from sit-coms, the overdone attempts at humor. The author is like a very young writer who needs more practice, reading time, and a good editor. It's quite surprising, really, that it got published."
1,Soulless,"Having just read today's NY Times, I can tell Martin Arnold why this book has not sold: you cannot fool the people. To even 'hip Type A' New Yorkers, Turn of the Century is banal, boring, and soulless. Where is the language of a novel? The poetry? This is so far from Bonfire it's ridiculous. There's nothing to care about it in here and the reading public senses it. Much ado about nothing. Random House should get the money back."
1,The least interesting piece of fiction of the decade.....,"I gave up after 200 pages. No character registered, the ""narrative"" (I use heavy quotes here) was non-existent, the dialogue banal, and the point beyond elusive. Fiction, while it should be incisive, must also be entertaining. This is neither. Alternately dull, frustrating, pretentious, inconsequential, and infuriating. Some have compared it to Wolfe; DO NOT believe them."
1,Good news; Bad news,The good news is that Amazon saved me 40%; the bad news is that I bought it at all.This one might be subtitled the Yuppie Yankee's revenge for having been made to study Faulkner in college.The book herks and jerks with poorly defined characters sputtering terse and abrupt New York-ese about matters irrelevent beyond 50 miles of show biz ground zero.Jim Cramer of TheSteet.com (whose throw-away lines are better prose than Anderson's all-time best) was even seduced by some alchemy ......and recommended the book.TURN OF THE CENTURY is simply neither productive nor enjoyable investment of reading time.
1,Empty,"Americans who attempt the comic novel rarely seem to realize that proper nouns are only a very small percentage of humor. Read the Brits like Waugh, Wodehouse, and Barnes, and realize that character, construction and ideas are important, too."
1,"Long, boring and ultimately pointless.","As social satire, I suppose that this book has some value. It effectively reveals the silliness of the television industry, for example. As a novel, however, this book is not very good at all. It is almost impossible to relate to or care about any of the characters (unless you're a television producer or Silicon valley executive, perhaps.) The plot is unengaging and somewhat implausible. In contrast, Bonfire of the Vanities had a good story to tell and interesting (if not sympathetic) characters. In Wolfe's novel, you actually cared to find out how the book turned out. It's a boring book that you will forget all about the day after you finish reading it. As Jerry Seinfeld once said, ""If I want a long, boring story with no point to it, I've got my life."""
2,A big disappointment,"Enough already! Don't we hear enough about the pretentious preciousness and self-consciousness of Anderson's folk in Vanity Fair and Talk? I found this book to be very un-interesting and had to restrain myself from throwing it across the room. Should have been written (if at all) 10 years ago - or it already was once, and better, by Tom Wolfe. Sorry, Kurt, I love your stuff for the New Yorker. Maybe next time."
1,"Wordy, conceited and sarcastic","I'm no Pollyanna when it comes to my choice of literature, but this novel left me with a really bad taste in my mouth. And I only read the first eighty pages!! That's when I decided to quit. The dialogue left me feeling that perhaps I wasn't ""hip"" enough to be reading it. I had nothing but disdain for the main characters and I couldn't stand their children. For me the author's conceit and sarcasm towards anything he did not consider acceptable (which basically is anything that anyone but the filthy rich experiences) oozes out from between the lines. I can usually plow through anything, especially when I buy it in hardcover, but the labor of interpreting the book's dialogue and the ensuing understanding of its banal content made me give it up. I couldn't convince myself that I would ever enjoy finishing it. Truly the worst book I've tried to read in a while. (and I've read some real stinkers!)"
3,"No Bonfire, But Amusing","Anderson's prose and clever dialogue keep this, too long, novel from turning into a bad joke. The character as caricature technique has been done much better by others, but the hit or miss satire and humor hit's often enough to make it work. The comparison to Tom Wolfe is inevitable and, I think, intentional. Wolfe's ""Masters of the Universe"" were so perfect because their real life counterparts were so ridiculously over-the-top to begin with. Anderson doesn't stand a chance in competing with his Hollywood / Silicon Valley / `90s caricatures. Even Wolfe had trouble repeating his feat in his own Man In Full. Besides the Hollywood stereotypes aren't new and have been done to death. Nevertheless, I found the book amusing and, if nothing else, good for conversation."
2,FROM 5 STARS TO ONE STAR,"THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THIS BOOK WAS WORTH 5 STARS, THE LAST QUARTER WAS A ONE STAR. THE LAST 100 PAGES WERE PREDICTABLE AND BORING. I FELT THE AUTHOR JUST WANTED TO GET THE BOOK OVER WITH. TOO BAD."
3,"Ambitious, but it misses the mark for dumb reasons","This book tries to capsulize a particular moment, wrap it in portent and a prayer that it keep for 10 or 20 years. That won't happen. If Anderson had stuck merely to the anthropological, he could have been profound. In fact, much of the novel approaches and sometimes achieves this brilliance. However, there's too many brand names and inside jokes, not to mention red herrings, weighing down this book's rise to greatness.I'll give him credit for one thing - the book's message seems to be ""appearances are everything, and they mostly lie"". Combine this axiom with the abundance of information flying around (ChopperCam is a great example of the syndrome), and Anderson perfectly nails the modern condition. Would that he were to follow his own example. Turn of the Century could have been a masterpiece at 400 pages. At 659, it's merely interesting. I recommend reading it in any case."
3,A fun book which lacks real depth and focus,"Although Mr. Andersen's book delivers a fun experience because it's full of brand names and high technology topics, it doesn't have any explicit point or focus. The implicit gist of the novel is contained within the first 100 pages, and those are fun to read. Thus the last 600 are sometimes laborious to read and boring."
2,"If it were 200 pages shorter, it would be 100 percent better","In a future that is supposed to rely on instant gratification, Andersen takes nearly 700 pages to tell a story that cannot sustain that length. He badly needed an editor to help shape this novel that is intriguing but in the end too taken with itself to draw much enthusiasm from readers."
2,complete inability to move the story along!,"forget the tom wolfe comparison. this book is simply BORING! i'm half through reading it, but i'm still waiting for something interesting to happen. if nobody tells me that the second half is much, much better than the first, i'm going to throw it away (which i rarely do). how could i believe this excellent book review (in a swiss newspaper)?"
1,Unreadably bad,"A book legnth portion of Andersen's lingo-centric, anti-received opinion style of journalism. This is not really a work of fiction, it is more of an agglomeration of puns, once au currant concerns, and careerist tribulation. No one with an ear for language will be able to read this ugly beast."
1,Protracted Boredom,"Encouraged by glowing literary reviews, I persisted in plowing through this flat and oddly unfunny satire long after reason told me to stop. Unlike good social satire, in which characters are engaging despite their vanities and foibles, the characters here are bereft of life, and serve only as portals through which the writer cudgels us with his allegedly trenchant observances. Thus it was that I read the entire 600 and something pages without ever being genuinely amused or entertained. The observances seem dated -- haven't we all had our nouvelle cuisine experiences by now? -- and devoid of the imaginative twists one looks for as leavening. Turn back unless you have low expectations and lots of time to kill."
1,Airport fodder for junkies,"Only those who value the literary acumen of Beverly Hills hair colorists and the L.A. Times who solicit their opinions, will find anything of human insight or passion in this pile of redolent garbage."
2,Quite a let-down,"I acquired Turn of the Century with high anticipation. A fan of the old Spy, I was sold by the frequent comparisons to Tom Wolfe, one of my favorite authors/social commentators. This book was quite a let-down, however. I forced myself to pick it up several times despite my complete lack of interest in any of the characters. I thought I would surely begin to like it at some point given the author's pedigree and the marketing claims behind it. It never happened, though - I found the book to be a pointless encyclopedia of the modern entertainment industry and culture, lacking in deeper insight, narrative force, or emotional impact."
2,There's a decent book in the middle....,"of this way too long novel. The first 100 pages nearly bored me to death. The last 100 pages suffered from predictability. The editor must have died and was never replaced. I know this is satire, but do the characters have to be so paper thin? George is the only character I can stand at all. There is excessive techno/industry speak throughout. Sorry...but Mr. Anderson is no Tom Wolfe."
3,"Engaging Characters, Clever Writing, Meandering Story","It was an exquisitely painful experience getting through Turn of the Century. The story never grabbed my full attention -- but the characters -- with all of their quirks -- and Andersen's way of using pen as sword to take on all that is holy in our ""digital,"" media-driven culture kept me turning the pages. The most memorable passage is the interview of contestants in the 2000 Miss America Pageant...""Miss Mississippi is blind, and will use her seeing-eye dog during the pageant. That will be good television, George thinks. Miss Oregon has one leg, and her talent is modern dance. Miss Nebraska has no apparent handicap herself, but says her dream is to use ventriloquism to aid the deaf."""
5,top notch 21 st century anguish,read this and maybe we wish the millenium was bringing us into the 19th century !ps why does lizzie land in haneda instead of narita when she comes to tokyo ?
2,Could Have Been Much Better...,"This CD is mostly just awful. Sure, it's her ""greatest hits,"" and they're all here (less the singles ""Money"" and ""Mary and Willie""), but it's the new songs - mostly awful - that break up the flow of the old classics. K.T. sounded her best when she was produced by Harold Shedd. The new songs are just awful tripe, with the possible exception of ""New Way Home,"" and even that production is overblown. Keep her old albums and make your own contribution."
5,I Love Jonathan Creek,"I have the entire series. However, I can only play it on my computer because when I went to buy it, it was only available in the european version. Alan & Caroline played well off each other. They made a great team & the series is excellent. You will be intrigued by each episode. Try as you might, I defy you to figure it out before the end of each show. Their comedic timing & terrific acting make this a series that you will want to watch over & over again. What's this I hear about the title character being reprized this year in a new series?marciajean223@yahoo.com"
4,Easily the most approachable book on Hindu practice I've see,"Initially I purchased this book for the multitude of color photographs contained within it. Once I began leafing through its pages, I realized it was written in such elegant simplicity that I was drawn in immediately.Each chapter covers a different aspect of Hindu worship in India: worship in the home, with one's community, at a temple, etc. The book does not so much explain Hinduism as it does the way Hindus approach their faith.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Indian culture or Hinduism. It's a fascinating read."
5,The best book on Hinduism,"Stephen Huyler filled his book with beautiful pictures, revealing stories and genuine insight into the daily life and worship of Hinduism. Many presentations of Hinduism focus too much on the esoteric elements or the philosophical schools. Huyler's presentation focuses on the common, real-life of Hindu worship, the heart and soul of the religion. He also touches on the other points without obscurity or distortion. This book is appealing and easy to understand. If you want to learn about Hinduism from books, you must read this one."
3,Hardcover not a hardcover,"I specifically ordered the hardcover version of this book, even though it was more expensive, because I just like the nicer quality of a hardcover book. What I received is a very sturdy softcover. It is very nice quality, not like a cheap mass market paperback. It is a beautiful book and I am not unhappy with it. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is as a ""heads up"" to people who actually read these reviews because some people might be disappointed if they think they are getting a ""real"" hardcover book and that's not what they receive."
3,Another wide-eyed innocent.,"This is the story of a girl who gets work as a horse trainer, not knowing that this is a type of prostitution ring. Its an ok story but it has a little too much of the wide-eyed idiocy for my stomach. But many Barbara Cartland books have that so if that is your taste the book is interesting."
5,Excellent!,"A really excellent live recording! The performances are outstanding, but the thing that floored me was the sound quality. This one will rock the house, thats for sure! Pristine and powerful with bass like you were right there. Awesome!"
3,Didn't make me more of a fan,"I'm a casual listener, not a great fan, of Sheryl Crow. But the great Amazon recommendations service keeps recommending her music to me based on my past purchases or browsing. So I thought I'd take a look. After surfing around the Crow catalog awhile, I decided that if I was going to get one Sheryl Crow album, this would be it.I've listened to this CD several times at work now, and I think: It's OK. Not great, not going to make me over into a huge fan, not revealing new aspects of her work. My original conclusion was on the mark: I could have done without a Sheryl Crow CD, but if I wanted to get one, this was a fine choice."
2,Not focused enough,"This book offers too much discussion of general software engineering. I suppose an enty-level developer might find that useful. I just wanted a book that teaches Struts, from ""Hello, world"" to the dirty details. If you already know the benefits of n-tier applications, much of the text is a waste. If you already know the value of design patterns, and how to apply some, then much of the text is a waste.I found the Wrox book, Professional Jakarta Struts, to be much more focused and useful. That book sticks to the topic, and provides very good reference information on the configuration file and tag libraries.Having said that, I did find the chapter on XDoclet to be useful."
4,Good Intro to Struts,"The book provides a good introduction to Struts and a starting point for more advanced topics & design patterns which may be found on-line. It does cover simple scenarios for extending the stuts framework. May be usefull for those who are not familiar with related technologies such asxdoclet, commons logging, and OR mapping. Overall it is not an advanced book."
2,Flashy terms for developer common sense,"The book packages developer commonsense as patterns and anti-patterns with some flashy names such as Tier Leakage, Data Madness etc. Nothing much of value here. Looking for serious Struts stuff? Just move on."
5,Great TV & Incredible Convenience,"We bought this unit to replace an older 25"" TV and separate VCR so that our boys could have their own TV in the playroom (i.e., the living room) with minimal mess of cords and components. Wow! The picture on this TV is ultra-sharp; colors are clear and bright, images have smooth edges. Put in a DVD and you will even more impressed. VCR playback was not quite as good but still very clean. We love the complete lack of cords and cables - little boys are that much less likely to get into trouble. We've only had it about two weeks, but so far we love this and are actually jealous of the boys as they now have a better TV than mom & dad!"
3,"Toshiba MW24F52 24"" Flat TV with DVD and VCR","Toshiba MW24F52 24"" Flat TV with DVD and VCRI purchased this television less than two years ago at Sears. There is a problem with the screen. The top two inches of the screen appears to have white lines as though it is missing pixels. Also the DVD player only works occasionally."
4,Nice tv,"Overall a very nice tv. It did have a small dent on top of tv like most of the other reviews stated. Definitely a manufacturers packaging problem. One thing I was really disappointed about was there was no memory card slot like the description said. This is one of the reason I decided to purchase. It does have a USB port though in front of the tv which is why I decided to keep. Amazon had best price for this tv online, plus no tax and free shipping."
1,had to return,Product came with a bad picture tube. It had purple clouds on it. The TV may have been damaged in shipment. We decided to return it because Toshiba would not provide at home service and the unit weighed 86 pounds. The service center was also 15 miles away. Amazon paid for a UPS pick up and the TV was tracked as returned but we have yet to get a refund. Amazon was than out of stock of this item or stopped carrying it and could not provide a replacement. Other partners in their system had it a higher price with very high shipping prices so we bought a different brand from Wal-Mart.
2,Kid didn't like it,"The kid opened it, pulled everything out, was completely unimpressed, and never did play with it. This was a 9-year old boy who likes putting stuff together and likes science-kinda stuff, so he is the target audience for this toy.If I had to guess, I would guess that the poor packaging put him off. It's very bland and boring and doesn't look like it would be fun at all, judging by the box. If it were colorful and had action and people pictures, and a fun set of directions, my guess would be that he would have been far more interested. As it was, though, nothing.To be fair, my coworker recommended this as a gift item--he used to have one as a kid and loved playing with it. Different strokes, go figure."
3,Answers for your Cravings,This book gives some excellent insight into our way of thinking and our behavior from what we are craving to eat! For the most part I have found it to be on target with how or what I was feeling at the time of my craving and the author gives some suggestions for a different way of thinking if or when the craving comes again.
2,Silly book would not buy again!~,Silly book would not buy again!~Constant Craving A-Z: A Simple Guide to Understanding and Healing Your Food Cravings (Hay House Lifestyles) donated to my local library!~
1,I'm craving a more helpful book,"If I want a 3 Musketeers bar, repeating the affirmation ""I enjoy this moment now"" is not going to help me. I won't enjoy the moment until I have a 3 Musketeers bar! How about telling me an alternate, healthy food I can eat that nullifies whatever internal chemical reaction causes the craving? Don't buy this book if that's the information you're looking for."
5,Enormous Info on Obscure Battle,Mr. Womack is to be commended for his attention to a particular element of World War II. Rather than trying to encompass the entire war into a single book he spends time examining a pivitol yet widely unknown saga of WWII. Historians and war buffs will want to read this book.
1,"Lame. A tourist visits the ""other.""","After reading this book, one is glad that Davis was mugged in front of his ritzy apartment. One only wishes that the mugger had broken Davis' typing fingers, so we readers could have been spared this idiotic tome"
5,best there could ever be,this is the most on time on beat ablum i ever heard if there was any over way to prove thereslves they did it no there the hottest thing because of the soul ful powerful ablum and the#1 song is 5steps
4,A Good Start for an Emerging Artist,"Kany Garcia's ""cualquier dia"" is a interesting CD. I wasn't sure what to expect when I loaded it onto my CD player, as Ms. Garcia is a new artist and I have not read or heard anything about her before.""Cualquier dia"" is a hard CD to categorize. Looking at the CD cover, I thought it was a jazz CD, a la Norah Jones, but ""cualquier dia"" is an interesting mix of pop music, with ballads, and songs that clearly have a country sound ""Amigo en el bano"" and rock ""Mujer de tacones."" One song, Si ya no estas conmigo,"" sounds like it could have been sung by Alanis Morissette.I liked this CD, and I will be listening to it again. Ms. Garcia has a good strong voice, and her backing band is versatile. She clearly shows promise and will become an even stronger performer once she discovers her niche."
3,perfect for working,"There are different categories of music that I like and I am not referring to genres, but rather music that I like to listen to while I'm driving, cleaning, working, and the like. I found Kany's cd was one that I liked to work with. The CD would be on and would be in the background, so I wasn't actively listening while I'm working. I enjoyed the CD.I did listen to it in the car, as well, but found that I'd listen to track and jump forward to another. This CD reminded me of a Latina Leona Lewis. LL sounds similar to Mariah Carey and Kany reminds me of other Latina artists, so she didn't exactly stand out. If anything, it's pop music that has been ""Latinized."" I know that this wasn't the intention, but that's what I got out of it. And, I do understand Spanish and I'm also Latina.Would I recommend buying this CD? I'm not sure. I think that one or two of my siblings might like it. My overall suggestion--give her a chance."
5,Discovering at 36000 feet....,"I discovered Kany at 36000 feet altitude in an America Airlines flight between Miami to Rio de Janeiro, and her three themes in the audio program captured immediately my attention and soul. It was so profound, so real with such a great voice that I searched and ordered this CD asap. As a matter I even ordered two, offering one to friends who visited us from France during ""new year""!Kany, a great carreer in front of you, and looking for the next Album!Marc- Miami/FL"
1,My review looks like it may be in the minority... BUT,"I didn't like this at all and I am of latin heritage. I do understand the language as it is used here or the music, and found this to be absolutely boring. The only track that had a little rythm to it was track 9 ""Carla se fue.""The background music was uninspiring, and even though her voice is pleasant enough, it just isn't enough to keep you interested in listening to more. She has potential, maybe with better accompaniment in her next one. Thumbs down on this one!One more thing: My copy of the CD shows 12 tracks listed but there are only 11 (with the digit 11 skipped - jumping from number 10 to 12) I don't know if all copies were printed this way."
3,Just okay...,"In my opinion, none of the songs on this CD really stand out apart from the others. The whole album sounds too much the same and there isn't really a uniqueness to the music that grabs your attention. I tried very hard to get into it by listening to it all the way through a few times... but in the end, it just wasn't my cup of tea. For her credit, she does have a nice singing voice but the songs just weren't that great or memorable. As far as albums go, it isn't terrible. I think the best words that I can use to describe the album is that it's just ""incredibly average""."
3,Decent,"It's probably not exactly fair to review such a CD when I can't completely understand the lyrics. However, there are other things to recommend a CD. The singer on this one has a clear, nice voice, and though the music wasn't exactly what I was looking for, it was quite pleasant. This is not a CD of sultry Latin sounds or pounding rhythms, but is instead a smooth, emotional ride carried by Ms Garcia's melodious voice. If you enjoy female singers whose voices can carry you away, rather than their onstage antics, this could be the one for you."
5,Very Good CD!,Very good CD. I saw her on a video and decided to give her a try. Bought the CD and I have to say it is very good!
2,not really impressed,"I just didn't work for me. I bought this(pretty expensive) product after reading all the good reviews about it. After, i used it for a few days this thing left a blueish layer on my scalp. It doesn't smell very good. What i did to remove that smelly layer on my scalp was to shave my head and start over with this solution and repeating that same next month. I saw no hair gain or loss. I don't use Rogaine, but i can clearly see the layer on scalp created by this product can definitely stop Rogaine from doing its job. My hair are still pretty thin after using it for 8 months, now."
2,No new hAir,All it does is make your hair feel thicker like a hair gel. I was disappointed. For its cost it should have grown a few new hairs
5,Won Me Over,"I love Elisa Kleven, the illustrator, but thought it was a silly story. I finally got a copy, read it to my children and preschool students, and they love it! I love the pictures and letting them search for ""perros"" and ""gatos"", ""pájaros"" and ""globos"". The children learn Spanish as they look!"
5,Gorgeous!,"This is a wonderful book for kids and adults, alike. It's a very loving and imaginative story paired with breath-taking illustrations. They colors are gorgeous and there are endless tiny details to point out in the pictures.I recommend this book very highly!"
3,Enjoyed but got a little tedious.,"I know I'm in the minority here and I did enjoy the first half of the book, but the second half started to drag and I found myself just trying to get to the end. The cute / funny comments Chris made on every page and almost every sentence were tiresome. But overall an okay read."
1,Sophomoric and repetitive,"Too bad there isn't a zero stars rating.Being a fan of the various NYC historical fiction books (Alienist, Time and Again, etc.) I was looking forward to a good satire of the genre.The first chapter is somewhat amusing. But then Elliot repeats the same jokes. Over and over and over. Flatuence and excrement, in the place of wit, abounds.The illustrations are amateurish. Sorry Elliot, your sister is not a wonderful artist.Astonishing that this was compared to the delighful and funny work of Doug Adams. This book simply does not compare."
1,This is the worst book I have ever read.,"I am an avid reader and a lover of books. I will generally read anything cover to cover, whether I am enthralled in the story or forcing my way through the end of an awful yarn. I couldn't even finish this book. It was HORRIBLE! I had prepared myself for a hilarious adventure (such as any of Douglas Adams' books) and instead got a disgusting, boring set of chapters that seem to have been forced onto the page by an immature, high school drama student. Don't even bother with this book. You'll be disappointed."
2,Funny....for a few pages,"Chris Elliott writes very much in the style of Dave Barry, which is a good or bad thing depending on your opinion of Dave Barry.Since both authors are basically making jokes and puns for the sake of making jokes and puns, the humor comes over as being very forced after more than a few pages where the aim is to get as many jokes into as many sentences as possible.The plot, such as it is, was an interesting framework to base the buffoonery on, and there were some definite funny ideas, such as the NCNYPD - Nineteenth Century NY Police Department - and the wooden oil-fired mobile phones.A certain, decent percentage of the time, Elliott can make you laugh. Not every joke is telegraphed, and he can be genuinely amusing. But this is a 350 page novel, and the relentless barrage means there will inevitably be misses, and the whole enterprise becomes tiresome way before the end.Recommended only for Elliott fans or those who love zany, virtually non-stop humor."
5,A must-read for anyone with a sense of humor!,"For years I've been searching for a book with this particular brand of witty, outrageous, inventive humor. I've always been a big fan of Chris Elliott's but this book just blew me away. Even though the ending of the book is particularly brilliant, turning that last page was bitter-sweet because I didn't want to put it down. Give us more Chris!On a side note, I would love some recommendations for similarly hilarious books."
5,Funniest book I have read in a long time...,"Maybe even the funniest ever. In NYC in 1882, a mysterious serial killer is running around killing ""four prostitutes, two women who looked like prostitutes and, oddly enough, a cow."" Author Chris Elliott narrates the story while narrating himself researching the story. Imaginative (because of the story itself), intellectual (because I had to look up some of the words he used in the dictionary to figure out what they meant), hilarious and (sometimes) suspenseful, it's The Da vinci Code meets The Simpsons, all wrapped in Chris Elliott's own twisted version of ""'Murder,' She Wrote."""
1,Disappointed,"My son insisted I read this book. I enjoyed ""Get A Life"" and even ""Cabin Boy,"" even though I appreciate the humor of Chris's father more than I do his. However, I tried to get into this book but could not get beyond the first 50 pages. I found it very self-indulgent, as if he was chortling himself over every ""witty"" sentence he wrote. Since the age of 10 or so I haven't found it funny for people in the 19th century to supposedly arrive somewhere in an airplane or for people to boast about accomplishments (the charge at San Juan Hill) that haven't happened yet. And what is funny about making Teddy Roosevelt the mayor of New York? I love Monty Python and off-color humor and am open to just about anything, but this just seemed a pointless sophomoric exercise. We got some ""Get A Life"" DVD's today for Christmas and I'm glad to get back to them."
2,Weak,"Elliott's cutesiness wore thin by the time I was one-third of the way through the novel -- seemed as though his bizarre twists were contrived on the spot without much forethought as to how the novel would evolve. Certainly a few clever plays on life in NYC, but I needed a mouthpiece to avoid grinding my teeth to a powder as I fought to finish the book."
2,Silliness Masking as Literature,"Yes, it was intended as a ""fun"" read (literature of the absurd?) and it did evoke several chuckles, especially at the first. But as literature (read into that word what you will) it's an abysmal failure. Crammed with so many jokes, puns, outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action, one's interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices. It's a case where you can't see the forest for all the intervening trees.I had expected a ""straight"" tale similar to the Alienist. Then when I discovered it was a humorous take on the police procedural I perked up. It was only after the 100th hyperbole and cutesy 20th century reference that I grew weary of the whole thing. Toward the end it descended into caricature. What's sad is that the idea was a good one - maybe the author should stick to SNL and the visual media. In fact, the book seemed very visual, almost as if the author were transcribing a SNL skit."
1,Dont waste your money!!,"After trying (and failing) to stay awake whilst reading the novel, I can recommend it as a sure-fire cure for insomnia! Aside from that the book is boring, badly written and a real disapointment."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This is really a worthless book, full of juvenile bathroom humor and forced jokes. I somehow got through a couple of chapters before I called it quits. My mistake was reading the good reviews and glossing over the poor ones. Buyer beware!"
5,AMAZING,This could be the most fun you will ever have with a book.Chris Elliott unfortunately will go down in history as one of the most intelligent comedians of all time and nobody will get it until it's too late.
5,Best bridge book I've read (and I've read a bunch),"What I like about this book is that he takes his time to build a point slowly and methodically, with lots of examples. You understand the logic behind the ""rules"", so you can figure them out for yourself. After reading it, I went back and picked up ""Bridge for Dummies"", and B4D paled by comparison."
1,Consider a MTH Z 1000,"The picture of the CW 80 is of an old Lionel transformer. I guess the seller does not care. I own a CW 80, and it works. However, if you should short out the unit for a few seconds the fuse will blow. Then you have to have a special tool to take it apart or send it out for repair. The fuse is not expensive, but it is hard to get to.I would recommend a MTH Z 1000, as it has a capacity of 100 watts and a circuit breaker. Should there be a short circuit you only have to wait a few seconds for the circuit breaker to cool off and press it to reset the unit. It's throttle is very smooth, and it activates the bell and whistle on all my locomotives. The MTH Z 1000 runs about $80 - 90, and being an electronics engineer I can say that is a great unit!"
2,Lionel CW-80 80 Watt,"My family loves the Polar Express train set, however we are on our third ""Transformer"". Sent back for repairs and the only thing Lionel can do is just keep replacing them. Not very fun when it dies right before Christmas, the kids were really let down, two years in a row."
4,The Master of Disguise (Star Wars Jedi Quest #4),"Jude Watson captures the essence of Star Wars in all her books, but this one was exceptionally good. I recommend it to all SW fans."
5,Hillarious as Always,"It's Jim Gaffigan, what more can I say? This CD is beyond Excellent.*Caution*: listen to this CD at your own risk while driving, I almost drove off the road laughing so hard"
3,"It's fine, just fine","I really wanted to like this album. I like Jim Gaffigan but this album just didn't have it. First off I started listening to it and thought I had a bad download, the sound would go in and out. Well it's edited for reasons I don't know. Whenever an album is edited it takes away from the album. So while listening to it, I unintentionally start listening for the edits. The album is okay, nothing that will leave you laughing in tears.If you are a Jim Gaffigan fan you should check it out, but if you are looking for a real funny album, this isn't it."
5,"Gaffican Rocks; Buy DVD ""Beyond the Pale""","If you like listening to comedy, this is great. Gaffigan is hilarious.His DVD ""Beyond the Pale"" is more my style; I like vegetating in front of the TV. This was a gift, but well received.Choose your media, but buy Gaffigan."
4,"I laughed, I cried.","I can't count the stand-up routines I hear or see and hardly crack a smile. Not so with Jim Gaffigan. Even after repeat listenings, I still laugh out loud many times it's so funny. The jokes and observations are excellent, and his delivery makes it even better. He definitely has his own thing going on. I also own and love his ""Last Supper"" disc, but this one is kind of a best of Jim, and comes with a DVD as well, so it's a no-brainer. Another hysterical combo is the last disc from Mitch Hedberg. Now that Mitch has past on, Jim is the best comic going from what I've heard. ""Doin' My Time"" is even better when enjoying a tasty Hot Pocket."
1,Censored! WTF??,"I love listening to Jim Gaffigan, and really enjoy all of his work. I was extremely disappointed to find out that this MP3 download is the censored version. Why would anyone want that? I wouldn't consider purchasing any other artwork that has patches of it removed because someone thought it would be too much for me to see the entire thing. I'll decide what's good for me, thank you. Keep your hands off of the original."
3,I wanted more!,"I love Gaffigan's stand up, and whenever anyone talks about a movie based on a book, I'll always quote his line ""You know what I liked about the movie? No reading"" But so much of the cd is the same as his material from the comedy central presents special. They only have the broadcast version of his CC special, not an unedited extended version like the Mitch Hedberg and Dane Cook CD's, and the CD doesn't have the routine I heard on Sirius radio that inspired me to buy this. So while I think he's terrific, if you've seen him on Comedy Central, I'd worry that there wasn't enough new stuff to justify buying this"
5,Hot set for Hoooot Pooockets.,"This was a plesent suprise a couple of years ago when I caught part of his act on Comedy Central, then I heard the CD at a local CD store, and happend to hear the Hot Pocket Skit, and I bought the CD on the spot. I have been guitly of the Hot Pocket purchase. Always sound like a great Idea for a quick snack/lunch, but can be exactly as described by Jim Gaffigan. His newer CD, Beyond the Pale, has The Hot Pocket skit on there as well, but this is the longer edition and original. Also, this is a set with CD and DVD. Both CD's Are great and have new different material on each, but If you have to buy one, this one would be the first one to pick up. Definitely will keep everybody laughing."
4,I like Jim,"The CD was pretty funny. I first saw Jim on Comedy Central Presents and I liked him better on TV. On the CD he keeps doing this weird little voice that's supposed to be the audience commenting about him and it gets real old, real fast. Besides that though, I did like it a lot."
1,Shocked!,"My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it. However, when I received it, there was a ""Parental Advisory"" label on it that read that it had explicit language. I was shocked! Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this. I am shipping it back right away."
1,reading the fine print,perhaps the information included the fact that it comes with a bonus DVD...but we missed it and now we have 2 of his DVDs...i hope we can find a use for it...expensive mistake?
1,Out of Date,Unfortunately Cisco has revised their on line curriculum to include Linux. This book only covers Solaris.
5,Utris Rocks,"Utris is one of the most unique bands around. Every song has it's own flavor You won't know what to expect when the next track comes up, which is more than I can say for most rock bands out there. If you can see them in concert, do it, they're great. Utris Rock On!"
4,Love it,I enjoyed reading the adventures of Pippi Longstocking as a child. I also greatly enjoyed the movies. Iplan to share both with my own children.
5,Great book!,This is great story that though it is older is a great book for kids to enjoy now too. Enjoy!
4,Good Fun,My children and I loved the stories. Watch out for the last story however. The generous Pippi shares guns with her friends. I had to explain to my six year old that this is from a different time in a different country and that she should never ever touch a gun.
2,Disappointing,"It's funny but it doesnt take the reader in me all the way to the end. One chapter, two the most, then the books gets boring. There is no continuity to the story. It's a bit like watching it on tv episode by episode. I'd say I'm disappointed!"
2,Good story but galling audiobook,"The story is good but perhaps a bit boring for children under 7 or 8 years of age. The narrator of the audiobook does a decent job but is not as lively as other narrators I have heard and unfortunately grossly mispronounces the name of one of the three main characters (which, given the number of times she is mentioned, becomes galling)."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"A book that is aimed at young girls, but is a kid's book in general. The young P L lives by herself, and has plenty of money. (Ok, well, she does have a monkey, so points for that).Basically, she goes around having a good time, and causing havoc for any nogoodniks that get in her way."
5,This album ROCKS,"I really like Starship, period. But this album is the best. All of the songs have great lyrics, and great sound. My two favorites though would have to be ""Nothings Gonna Stop Us Now"" and ""Sara"". If you haven't heard this album, then I really recommend it......"
5,One of Dick Dale's Best,"Dick Dale is a founding father of Surf music and this 1964 album demonstrates just how much this music had matured in a few short years. The title track is my favorite, a beautiful piece of Surf music with a very complex guitar sound. It's truly a study in good taste, reverb and tremolo.The rest of the album is likewise solid Surf music and in my opinion represents the genre at the apex of its first wave, just before the Beatles changed the musical landscape. Dale's blending of Rock & Roll and Spanish musical influences truly makes for a fine listening experience.Forty five years later Dick Dale is still a force to be reckoned with. He has beaten cancer twice, lived a life filled with music, family, friends, big cats (Lions, Tigers etc.) and he's still going strong. He's well worth listening to."
4,Nice little espresso cups,Attractive colors. What more can I say? They are little cups made expressly for espresso. Enjoy your coffee in small sips!
3,does break globes,"So I've gone through 3 globes with mine in as many years. After the last one I think i've figured out how not to break them and there have been no problems since.If the lamp is very cold when you light it, and the bottom of the globe heats up and expands faster than the top, you're gonna have a bad time. When you're putting the globe on after lighting it, start the flame as low as you can and give it a couple seconds to warm up. After that everything's cool.Aesthetically, this thing holds up. The brass is lacquered so the luster holds up.Structurally, I noticed that one of the three self tapping screws has totally stripped, perhaps with vibration over years.This can burn paraffin with no smoke or odor.So if you need a lamp, this can do the trick, you just have to be careful when you're lighting it or be ready to order a spare globe."
1,Was told you CANNOT get replacement arrows!,I bought this for my son's birthday and he and his younger brother like it a lot. However in less than 24 hours one of the arrows got a split in it after very careful use. The arrow is not able to be used now so we only have two. I called Hasbro and was told that they do NOT make replacement arrows for this toy because it is a Toys R Us exclusive.The toy is great but it is fairly useless if you really can't get replacement arrows...so I give it 1 start overall. They couldn't tell me if any of their other arrows worked with it either. Unless you can find a source for replacement arrows (it only comes with 3) I'd suggest that you spend money on something else and beware of ToysRUs exclusive toys!
4,Big bad bow...,"I got this as a christmas gift and participated in some of our neiborhood battles. It is quite powerful and fast for a nerf gun. Also, the scope is a nice touch. The only bad things are the arrows that it comes with. They would tear easily and break. Overall, this is a good nerf gun to beginners and pros alike."
1,No Replacement arrows???!!!,My son and daughter have loved this toy but after 6 months I came back to get replacement arrows and found out they do have them - What??? What good is a toy that you can not use because you can not get more arrows? I guess that fact that I am so frustrated is that my kids really love the toy!
4,Go somewhere else!,"The price on Amazon for this cool toy from this retailer is 3X the price on Target.com, same as several other Nerf products. Caveat Emptor!"
5,pretty awesome,"I really like this 'bow', its too bad you can't get it in stores anymore it seems, but thats what Amazon is for and why I love it.Its a little tricky to put together at first- definitely at least glance at the instructions.I put ikea furniture together all the time without looking at instructions- but for this I did.it seems really sturdy and its a lot of fun."
5,This and the CS-35 gun are the best fighting weapons,"We bought several Nerf guns, and just had our first family war in the back yard. This bow is reliable, shoots very far, and with a bulky dart has an impact. It looks awesome, and my 10 year old girl dogged me with it. It shoots a few arrows, and probably suits an older kid oor adult since the arrows are big. The CS-35 with circular clip is the best gun as it shoots as far as this one, holds more, and allows for more play time. I would both of these for a good competition."
4,Replacing earlier review after I read the directions,"This was a gift my wife and I bought for my son't birthday. At the party while my son was still opening gifts a friend put it together ""reading the directions"". Well, actually I found out today when I was cleaning things up where we had the party he didn't read the directions too well and the way I had rigged th bow to work was the proper way for it to be set up.It isn't a great product, but it is fun and now from reading other reviews and replies people made I see I can get extra arrows cheap enough because they are just foam and probably won't last long. Not sure what the deal is with Amazon showing the darts from the guns because from what I have read the darts won't work with this without some modification."
4,Good toy once you figure some key things out...,"This is a pretty good toy plagued by two issues:1. Given the size of the gun, 35 (at best) feet seems lousy.2. It only comes with three arrows.However, these are EASILY dealt with:1. Take out the air restrictor. It's louder, but shoots better. You can cut off the end so it will shoot microdarts, too. Your choice. Search BBB mods and you'll find it.2. Instead of going through all the trouble to order replacement arrows from Hasbro, buy the Air Zone Foam Arrow refill pack. They work fine and actually seem to shoot further than Nerf's arrows! For $6, I now have 6 better shooting arrows.Read the other reviews if you want more info about the actual item, but these issues were the only real complaints I had, and they're fixable."
1,save ur money,"you should buy something better than this. The old nerf crossbow, now that was fun this thing barely makes it across the room."
2,Looks better than it shoots,"Purchased in order to try as an addition to the suction tip dart shooting crossbows I like for skirmish games. Rather annoying to assemble unless one skips the purely decorative string. Primary deficiency is weak shooting. Even if one could manage to accurately target an opponent beyond four feet, anyone with a pulse can dodge or block the arrow. The ""other"" brand's replacement arrows were somewhat more effective once they were made to fit the Nerf weapon correctly. Good for playing catch with foam arrows at close range but no match for the crossbows in ""combat."""
2,This is not a crossbow,"When we got this together (gift for a 10 year old), it was ok, but not at all what was expected. Perhaps I didn't read the description carefully enough, but it is not a crossbow, but a dart gun. The bow is purely decorative. It works well enough and seems sturdy. It took three of us to decipher the assembly instructions, and I usually have no trouble assembling toys. Also the resident 7 year old girl seems to like it better than the 10 year old boy does."
5,Worth its weight in gold,"This is one book I can't do without. I was introduced to Kenneth Koch's work when I was at the University of Wisconsin-Madison taking a workshop from an author who had taught with Koch. It has been my ""writing Bible"" ever since. I have used almost every exercise at one time or another with elementary school children, with fantastic results. Along with Koch's ""Rose, Where Did You Get That Red?"", this is a classic."
3,Pretty Good - little dated,This book has some nice ideas for getting children thinking about poetry and some techniques for developing the writing process. Good for teachers who are worried about teaching poetry; it has a lot of examples of student poetry. The text could be improved with more recent student poems (many reference pop culture of the 70s) and more writing techniques from an up-to-date educational perspective.
5,Professional quality,"I was looking for a trigger outlet to control my power amp with my processor. I didn't want to hook up my 1,000 watts Rotel amp to just any consumer grade power bar that had this feature (Monster 1000 comes to mind) so I got this one. Built tough and capable of handling the high current peaks of my amp, instead of restricting it. Quality build second to none, very easy to hook up and works just as expected. Don't settle for anything less if your looking to trigger a non-trigger optioned power amp. The AC3 won't limit the current of the 20amp dedicated breaker I had installed to feed this amp. Top socre *****"
5,great for old amps,have two parasound amps that don't have 12v trigger. I always forget to turn them off. used the 12v trigger out from my receiver into this and now my problems are solved. i'm sure it will pay for itself quick with energy savings and extended amplifier life.
2,Flawed by sloppy research,"An interesting, well-written book that gets many facts right. It should, however, be read with a grain of salt Passages that I have first-hand familiarity with are woefully wrong. The problem, as I see it, is that author Walker relied on sources who deliberately mislead him and, rather than seek different accounts and opinions, published the self-serving distortions. That is a shame, because it casts doubt on the veracity of the book's entire content and could easily have been avoided if more responsible research had been done."
4,Simply put... Keitel's Best,I have seen a ton of Harvey Keitel movies and he is awesome in everyone but he stars in very few. Well he certainly stars in this one. This has to be his defining role. His performance was so great that i dont know how anyone couldnt enjoy this movie unless they simply are not a fan of his. The movie itself is pretty good too but Keitels performance is what makes this flick. I applaud the director for having balls and i applaud Harvey for showing them off. If your a fan of the shield or just enjoy gritty cop dramas then this is for you. If yoru easily offended then you might want to stear clear of this one.
4,A Disturbingly Realistic Film!!!,"'Bad Lieutenant' is less about guilt than it is about redemption. Harvey Keitel gives a gutsy performance as the Lt., he bravely delves into the complicated mind of this disgusting character. An admirable actor/director teaming, Abel Ferrara directs with surefire tempo and adds a cinema verite style to the film. The film is a slow descent into the vowels of hell, as we see the Lt. degrede himself in various ways; doing or selling the drugs he confiscates, drinking vodka like it were water, sleeping around with women, gambling dangerously. He is a very bad man, but as he gets a rape case involving a nun, he starts to question his existence and even has a spiritual experience. A disturbingly graphic film that remains one of the sleaziest films ever made, but also a brave film that is undeniably gripping if not a bit too uncomfortable. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
3,This guy had a LOT of problems,"From the beginning when he started snorting coke in front of his kid's school you knew this wasn't the Dick Van Dyke Show. Loses at least one star just for those noises he kept making. Gains one just for having Harvey who makes any character a little better. The scene with the two girls in the car was interesting but had the potential to be more intense. Not sure which was worse his gambling problem, his drug problem or his sexual problem. A good example of some very self destructive behavior. Not a guy I liked seeing with a gun."
1,Abomination of all that is holy!,"Although this is an older movie, I felt compelled to write a review after I recently saw it. Besides the fact that this movie has no redeeming moral values at all, it is also utterly depressing. After watching this I wondered what the actual point of this movie is. It seems like the director is trying to make some profound statement about the human condition, but I fail to fully understand his message. If you really want to see a classic movie dealing w/ corrupt cops then go rent Serpico. It made me sick to think that there probably are morally unjust cops like Harvey Keitel's character.Do yourself a favor and dodge this absolutely stagnant garbage. I would easily watch Shaq-Fu continuously, than suffer through this film again. If you decide to disregard my words and rent this movie, then make sure you bathe yourself in holy water after it's over."
1,The Most Nihilistic Movie I've Ever Seen,"If you are a jaded, cynical person with a rotten view of life (and these days, who isn't?) you'll...well, you won't necessarily ""enjoy"" this movie, but it will satisfy you in the same way that manic-depressives satisfy themselves with razorblades.Will appeal to the same folks who reveled in the violence and/or depravity of ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""Happiness,"" ""Boogie Nights,"" ""American Beauty,"" etc."
1,No Redeeming Qualities,"There are no redeeming qualities about the script, which overwhelms its viewers with drugs, corruption and violence until the lieutenant meets his untimely end. It is a movie that contains so much depravity, which is brilliantly portrayed that it will leave you feeling depressed once its over. Don't let children watch it because it could corrupt their minds. My advice is don't buy it, if you must see it rent it, but remember, you've been warned!"
2,Harvey must have needed to pay the bills to take on this one,"I believe this is [the] bottom of the barrel performance of Keitel's life. The story was stilted, disjointed and incoherent. Maybe it was meant to be that way, but it was a dumb movie, altogether. I won't waste my time detailing the premise of the story, but there are parts that will make you laugh out loud - the car scene with the two young girls that Keitel ""gets his rocks off"" (literally), that's absolutely hilarious. I really don't feel that this movie was meant to be serious, because it was too far out there. It's possible that the drug-induced scenes were real, because Harvey Keitel had to have been on drugs to perform the way he did in this film. The Director must've been on drugs when he made this movie....honestly."
3,What happened to the original?,"This film was fantastic in the theater! Left me with that dark erie feeling when I left the theater. What happenened? Although there is not that much actual film cut, the missing scenes leave a gaping hole in Harvey Kietels ""Bad Lieutenant"". Wish I had known this version had been cut. Still give it 3 stars because Kietel is in it. Anything that Harvey is in gets that just for having him."
3,Bad Lieutenant,"In this movie Harvey Kietel does more drugs, drinks more alcohol, and shoots his gun while driving his police car than most criminals do in the course of their day. Harvey drops his kids off at school then does coke. He goes home and drinks. He goes and shoots heroin. Then a nun is raped and he tracks down the assailants.This isn't a bad movie, I just wonder how he can do so much drugs and alcohol and keep his car on the road. He shoots his radio because the LA Dodgers lose baseball games (which he bet large sums of money). In the end he is shot and presumably killed. Too bad we didn't get to see a scene where his supervisor gives him his annual performance appraisal."
1,STREAMING VERSION IS EDITED!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an excellent movie. The digital version of this movie offered through amazon as a streaming rental is EDITED with near full scenes deleted. I believe they are going the way of Blockbuster with the ""all family appropriate"" mentality. I had seen this movie several times and wanted to re-watch it, and to my horror i ended up paying for a ""clean"" version. It would be nice if Amazon let you know this before you pay!"
3,Blu-ray details / ...not bad for a Bad Lieutenant,"This is a BLU-RAY REVIEWBD does show some but far from spectacular improvement over SD DVDFilm: 7/10Picture quality: 7/10Aspect ratio: 1.78:1 (orig.: 1.85:1??)Audio: EnglishST: Engl.; Span.

1,Bad Movie,"Yes, Harvey Kietel is one of the best actors of his generation. Yes, he should be admired for taking on risky roles such as the title character here. But give me a break. This film is so bleak and Kietel's character so unlikeable that the movie is absolutely no fun to watch. And as for the grotesque religous symbolism, I don't even want to go there. Almost any of Kietel's other movies (yes, even Bill Cosby comedy ""Mother, Jugs and Speed) would be a better purchase than this one."
1,Disgraceful!!!,"Harvy Kietel is one of my all time favorite actors. I kept reading that this was his best movie so I went and rented it. All it is is one scene after another showing us what a screw up this guy is. After all the drugs and all the corrupt acts of the first 45 minutes I turned it off because all it did was waste my time. For good Kietel, rent Reservoir Dogs."
2,Waste of Time,"This boring and uneventful film is so bad after I heard the 'great' reviews, how many times is one suckered into believing that independent films can all be good? Well, there's plenty of stinkers in the lot! Don't get this unless you are a depraved sicko who likes to watch Keital in his B-day suit, a total artless flick."
1,Don't bother,"I love Harvey Keitel movies, but not this one.It was painfully bad to watch.It reminded me of when Dan Aykroyd used to do hisskit on Saturday Night Live, ""Bad Cinema.""I love bad movies too, because sometimes they areso bad that they are good; however, this one is not oneof them. Luckly, the price is so cheap that if you buy itanyway you wont be losing much. Don't say you weren't warned."
4,RATINGS GOOF,"I love this very, very dark film. But this is merely a correction. The Lionsgate rating is NC 17 not ""R"" as Amazon lists it. Meaning that all the sex, doping and Keitel's private parts are on healthy display."
5,True Story,"I saw this movie years ago and still have to watch it again when I see it on TV. Harvey Keitel plays a role so conviencing, of a man barely hanging on to sanity. Personally having close friends to the same type of addiction makes this very accurate. This is the type of movie that you never forget about. Director and actor do a excellant job. Watch it....."
4,Crackhead Cop,"The Bad Lieutenant is an interesting movie for the simple fact that Harvey Kietel's performance is one of his best.His is a character with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.If you wnat to see how many dispicable acts a Police officer can commit in the space of 90 minutes or so, this is the movie for you.Other reviewers have knocked the Director for his style here so I will not disagree with that.To me that is of secondary interest to the inhuman meltdown that Keitel undergoes as he sinks deeper and deeper into the depths of his addictions and other sordid behaviors.It is the greatest implosion I've seen a character undergo in a movie.Just when you think he can get no lower he commits some other vile act(the scene when he pulls over 2 teenage girls for instance).He makes any other corrupt cops look like Elliot Ness in comparison."
3,Wrong Version,"The version that I just saw on Amazon Prime is NOT the unrated version, in fact it is the R rated version. I prefer to see my movies the way they are advertised. Anyway the movie itself isn't all that bad (no pun intended). It just seems to be a little dated to me. Yes I know that the movie is old, it just doesn't make me feel nolstalgic watching it like let's say Scaface or Carlito's Way! I would recommend that people should see the unrated version of this film and give it a chance so that you could decide for yourself. Enjoy! :)"
3,Keitel is brilliant; film is depressing but means to be,"Harvey Keitel is a great actor; no exception in this picture. A deeply ""bad dude"", Keitel captures the humanity trapped in a depraved human. The film is bleak, the cinematography brilliant, a little too depressing for me, but a great work, no doubt.NOT A DATE MOVIE! If your girl sees the gratitous-and it really is the most unneccessary nudity I have EVER SEEN, you better be packing a massive schlong because Keitel sure does! Forget John Holmes, this guy is HUGE and appears to have no erectile issues! Despite the humbling natue of the nudity, it is ridiculous as it serves NO PURPOSE in the film, at all. Otherwise, brilliant, depressing movie; reminded me of feelings""year of the Dragon"" brought up"
1,Boring!,This review is written to save 2 hours of one's time that will never be recovered. The plot develops slowly - too slow for my taste.
2,Big Disappointment,"Going into ""Bad Lieutenant"" I expected a gritty character focused film about a man who is extremely flawed but a dedicated cop nonetheless. What I got was a messy, rather unfocused film that thinks it is much more artistic that it actually is. First off, while I commend Harvey Keitel for his performance (the little of it that was actually shown) the movie fails to elicit any kind of interest in either the character or the ""story."" Harvey really doesn't put on much of a performance at all. He doesn't have much dialogue nor does he have much in the way of physical expressions. All in all this movie isn't worth getting. Nic Cage's Bad Lieutenant is WAAAAY better. I'd highly recommend that one."
1,Nothing redeeming about the character nor the movie,"The main character is a total low-life. The movie was a waste of time, even though I ended-up fast-forwarding through it.If you're watching it and expecting the character or movie to get better, well, neither do. They just get worse as the movie progresses."
3,"""Bad Lieutenant"" Review","Abel Ferrera's controversial 1992 film about a self-destructive police lieutenant is not for everyone. Keitel gives a solid performance as the title character, an obsessive crooked cop who is called into investigate the sexual assault of a nun. Ferrera loads the film with shocking images that will offend sensitive viewers but unfortunately, the movie falls a little short in the storytelling department. The movie never really steps out of the boundary of its basic premise which is about a man trapped in his own personal demons. While often compared to Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"", it plays out more like Larry Clark's ""Kids"". It is a raw and realistic portrait of a character that could very well have been pulled out of today's headlines."
4,EVERYTHING TRAINING TRIED TO BE.,"MY TITLE FOR THIS REVIEW IS ALL THE REVIEW THIS NEEDS.FOR THOSE WHO THOUGHT TRAINING DAY WAS ALL THAT,CHECK THIS OUT TO HOW IS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE."
4,He's soooo BAAAAD!,"Harvey Keitel is excellent in this disgusting portrayal of a cop gone bad. He's so bad that the character's name is never mentioned in the entire movie to include the credits. You can just refer to him as ""The Bad Lieutenant."""
1,5.1 digital??..yeah..right!,loved this movie have the dvd and laserdisc..but i was glad to see on the packaging finally a 5.1 soundtrack...NOTTA!!!...its the 2.0..unbelieveable i clicked on audio choices...you have the choice between 2.0 and the audio commentery...stick with the original from aartisan...very decieful
1,"""Only for cult followers...""","The whole time you follow Harvey getting drugs, using drugs, placing bets, and doing other bad things while on duty. It's tedious and painful to watch; I can only give it points for its ""right there,"" documentary-style camera-work and Harvey's effort in portraying the character. Rent it first to see if you want to buy... But be warned, Harvey will do an anguished, tormented whine/cry of agony that will stay with you for 3 days at least..."
3,lousy father,"living in an attached economy grade house, he tells his kids that they are spoiled because he has to ""chauffeur"" them to school, then he goes off to do all the things that this movie is notorious for - drugs, sex, general street trash behavior. This movie has nothing to do with the crime of the nun getting raped but about this ridiculous adventure of an abusive a-hole. Don't let the Catholic stuff fool you. He identifies with the two rapists. Don't blame Catholicism for what he does in the end at the bus terminal."
2,YAWN,"Watched about 45 minutes, then had to stop. Just wasn't interested enough to go watch it. It just didn't have the grab ya story line to suit me."
4,Entertaining subject,"Holy Skirts depicts a real-life character, the Baroness, who is at times fascinating and exasperating. She is a pioneer in many ways, but deliberately and repeatedly puts herself in harm's way for no discernible advantage. The writing is in general very good. The author, however, focuses on the Baroness's efforts to have her poems recognized, and ignores the fact that she was a found-object sculptor in the Dada vein."
5,Yummy Gingerbread,This is a great gingerbread mix that you can use all year round. It is great during the holidaysand great as a bread with a fruit plate during summer!
5,Outstanding,"I ordered a bulk load of Betty Crocker gingerbread cookie mixes. They came quickly, efficiently, and well packaged. No problems at all."
1,Very Disappointed,"We are very disappointed with the Aviva Arctic Station. There is a rip in the plastic at the seam, therefore the dome does not stay inflated. The kids were very disappointed when we tried blowing it up a couple days after Christmas."
4,"Odd Toot, The - Bampot","The Odd Toot's debut, BAMPOT, at first sounds like straight up jazzstep (as in the opener, ""Stoopid Oopid""), but the weirdness quickly takes over. True to its jazz roots, the tracks diverge and go in entirely unexpected directions. There are sharp and funky breaks too, like on ""Scattergood"" or ""Noog,"" for the unrepentant beatheads in the house. But they also know when not to take things too far: ""Man in Black"" is beautifully atmospheric, smooth and frenetic, and stays that way for its running time, and ""Crank Up the Perhaps-A-Tron"" speeds along with a jazz-fiddle (no, really!) at the fore. ""Spuds `Take Them Oh Take Them' Song"" is a little slice of sleazy listening intercut with a shrill acid line. ""Hot Rock Tee"" merges the jazz and the breaks into a cohesive whole, while keeping a sly sense of humor about it."
1,Useless,"This could have been an interesting book. The effects of revivals on one urban area, in this case St. Louis, Missouri, would make a worthwhile study in the hands of a competent author. Beller, however, is not that author. For one reason, he seems to me to see his particular fundamentalist Protestant denomination as just about the only Christian church there is. Too much space is wasted in sectarian carping at other Christians, both Catholic and Protestant. Even Billy Graham is not immune.For another reason, Beller believes that Protestant Christianity died in St. Louis around 1900(one chapter is entitled ""Why St. Louis Went to Hell"")and he allows nothing to shake him from his idea. Any St. Louis revivals after Billy Sunday's in the early 1900's are completely ignored, including the 1973 Billy Graham revival at which I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior."
5,DON'T THINK TWICE,"DJ Rhettmatic lays down some very serious mixes with authority built by an exclusive range of top notch hip hop that invigoratingly schools all those that partake. Rhettmatic takes you on a trip through top notch Cali rhyme sayers (primarily - among others) that could only be equaled by DJ Babu's World Famous Beat Junkies [East Coast] set. But that's apples to oranges - Rhettmatics set stands apart from many mixmasters if only in his ability to dig into intense psyche stimulating artists. This two CD set will change your take on the tracks as originally recorded and allow you to build appreciation for lingual artistes you've come to explore. This CD set is a SOLID GOLD buy - a few listens and you'll be wondering why it isn't broadcast nationally, if only to set the standard of hip hop that should be aired."
2,Sometimes more is less,"The only way I can like this novel is by assuming its excesses are tongue in cheek digs at the degeneration of the lesbian crime novel into political uncorrectness. The detective heroine is ""scarred"" and a moral midget. She has no principles. For some unfathomable reason, her highly educated supportive and working lover is always sexually available. Our heroine is allowed to sleep around without being punished, something that usually doesn't happen in dyke crime. She doesn't solve anything, but Scoppetone's been doing that for years. She's just the paid witness to a ""bizarre"" tale anyone who has seen Ricki Lake would yawn at. But even though I never took the book seriously and could enjoy, at some level, its deviance from genre correctness, its stand on drugs irritates me. Any author presenting cocaine consumption as less damaging than it really is, is doing readers a disfavor. Read Redmann instead."
2,Through a Howling Wilderness,Quite good and well written. So much like Kenneth Roberts' Arundel that it is worth reading but you don't need both in your library.
4,Through a Howling Wilderness,".The more I read about Benedict Arnold's trek to Quebec, the more interesting it becomes. Desjardin is one of the few authors that bothers to explain why the invasion of Canada was important and what its long-term impact on the American Revolution may have been.I especially liked Desjardin's comparison of this trek to that of Hannibal's ancient march. The sufferings and the stoicism of Arnold's men were both terrible and fascinating and should be better known.This is a very readable book. Although it is aimed at the general market and quite similar to Kenneth Robert's classic novel, ""Arundel,"" it is well worth reading. It would be a good book to give as a gift to a young adult reader.""Through a Howling Wilderness"" has an extensive section of notes at the end, making it useful to scholars and historians. This is both good history and a great adventure story.This would be an excellent choice for a high school or History 101 book report.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware"
3,"""Through a Howling Wilderness""","Although this is a good book, the author keeps a distance from his subject and it never comes alive. General Arnold's march up the Kennebec River was an American epic of courage and folly, and the final doomed assault on Quebec City was important for what it could have led to. The author reports the facts without seeing or feeling their sweep, or trying to enter the minds of those involved or even sensing the urgency of attacking a stronghold in winter before enlistments expired. The march had supposed that many French Canadians would support the revolution, but it may have turned more against the American cause."
4,Nice Table,"I had my fears this would be a shabby plywood assembly with cheap game tables, but they were unfounded. The quality is impressive. Everything is heavy and feels solid. The game tables are great and the wheel isn't as crappy as I feared. I'm very happy with this table. I took a star off because the wood is a darker color than oak. It might just be stained darker than the picture. It's not that big a deal. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase."
1,Totally disappointed!!!,"Poor plot, speechlessly confusing storyline, none scary or gory, the longer I watched, the more ""?"" I got, wondering why other viewers could give more than 1 star???The ending scene is meaningless and made me laugh, the wicked killer-mom came back from the dead and killed the blood-coated boy, who was supposed the dead too? God, what was the message supposed to deliver?I love horror movie, but this one...sorry to say that it is really a waste of my money to have bought this DVD."
1,What's 97 minutes of your life worth?,I'm 20 minutes from the end and i don't care how it turns out this is still a piece of garbage on any budget. On a positive note the actors seem to sincerely try to polish this turd to no avail. Pay attention to who is giving the great reviews on the dvd it's usually a clue as to what awaits you. At least it was a library rental.
1,Waste of time.,"This movie was difficult to watch. Very cheesy, not scary. It is the type of movie you might see on the sic-fi channel. My 12 year old son thought it was pretty good. If you are a preteen you might like it, but that said, even then I do not think I would have liked it as a 12 year old. I enjoyed true classics as a teen like Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Evil Dead 2. This movie does not have the potential to be a cult classic. I was glad when it was over. I should have paid the $2.99 for Brainscan."
3,Better Than most,"It was worth the time to sit and watch , better than most b list movies. I give it Three stars."
2,bad,So bad my husband couldn't watch the whole thing. He says he might give it another try later when bored.
2,Shallow Story,Seemed like it would be something a bunch of teenager would make a movie about. Very poor horror flick. Two thumbs down on this one.
3,Quick review,"Shallow Ground is worth at least one viewing if you are a horror fan. It won best picture at the Dead by Dawn Film Festival 2004. Quite bloody and gruesome at times with a somewhat solid story backing it up, and I felt the acting was decent too."
2,shallow ? yes this is a shallow film.,"in my opinion shallow ground was a low buget mediocre film that seems to try way to hard to impress audiences,also by calling this independent film a horror movie, psychological maybe. Splashing buckets of blood on the floor and on a naked boy who walks throughout the entire film with creepy crawling bugs DOES NOT MAKE IT A HORROR MOVIE . 45 mins into this film i seemed to have lost a bit of interestsbut i was hoping for a tragic ending or even something out of the ordinary but sadly i was not impressed. The movie doesnt seem to go anywhere but under ground. 97 mins was long enough some of the acting was below standard acting and the story line itself had potential but failed by not giving a full detail ending. worth a rent but do not expect much at all"
1,Shallow Plot More Like....1 Star for makeup!!!,"What the #@?!.... Oh Dear, dear, dear & it all started so well. It all started off so interesting, but then the writer must have decided to shoot off to the pub for a few and left the script with his 5 year old daughter! I can't tell you how utterely disapointing this film is...I am begining to think that us westerners just can't make a decent horror flick. Out of the last 15 horror films I have watch only 2 have been any good (The eye & Into The Mirror). A coincidenc that they are both Asian films..I think not. Now I know everyone goes droll on about subtitles but I would much rather have to read titles than have to watch this Bristish and Americam trash that flies out from the Box office. WESTERN FILM MAKER - WATCH AND LEARN!!! Please don't bother renting this crap."
4,THIS IS A DAMN GOOD HORROR FILM !,I don't think i watched the same movie all these bad reviewers watched!?! The movie i just watched was way too good to be the same movie getting these ronchy & VERY uncalled for reviews. SHALLOW GROUND boils the slasher genre together with the supernatural genre & the result is a excellent new horror film with plenty of jolts & tingles & buckets O blood! I'M SHOCKED BY THE HARSH REVIEWS! the movie i watched was a breath of fresh air!
2,Not the best but not the worse,"This movie was not scary at all. If you want a scary movie, DONT Buy it. If one of your family members was in it buy it just to see that they were in the movie. Otherwise its not worth your 26 dollars."
1,Shallow Ground.,"Movie has it's spooky moments but it doesn't make the cut for me. And the ending was even worst. All the blood and gore couldn't save it,but I will say the story is different from other movies."
2,Very Shallow Indeed.....,"Yet another movie I rented hoping to see a good horror flick. The only thing good about this movie is the blood and gore ( reason for the 2 star rating ) I guess you can't expect too much from such a low-budget film. Confusing plot when a young boy covered in blood walks into a sheriff's office. Eventually, the sheriff's department learns not to touch the boy or his blood or they will suffer the consequences. You see some ""revenge"" of ""the dead"" but overall, boring plot. This movie was not good enough to keep me interested. A big letdown."
1,Not what I expected!,"If you have a large food processor and an interest in stocking your freezer with Anderson's required ""mixes"", (necessary in order to use many of her recipes), then you'll probably like this book. I have neither the food processor nor the freezer space, so the book was a big disappointment to me. I've always disliked cookbook authors who expect you to do everything exactly the way they do, with no other options. Unfortunately, Anderson is one of those authors. The mixes you have to prepare ahead of time may shorten the actual preparation time for a recipe, but it also requires you to have time to stock up on these mixes in advance. Why would I want to allot time to prepare several of these mixes in advance and stuff them into my freezer when I don't even know which recipes will take my fancy on any given day? And all of this assumes I can afford to go out and buy a large, expensive food processor! Most of these recipes give you no other option. Very disappointing."
1,NOT SO great performance,"I bought this to replace an MSD Digital 6 that had crapped out after 3500 miles on my Cobra replica with a 460 CJ motor. The Mallory was very well priced, about half of what I paid for the MSD box. It feels like it has added another 30 horses. Can't wait to see if gas mileage also goes up. Makes me want to get a dyno run again as the MSD was dogging it.Spoke too soon-after 800 miles this box just quit. Had to buy another one over the weekend (MSD 6AL) to get my car to a car show today. Amazon refuses to help me out and say I have to work through Mallory to get any restitution. Too bad it could not stand the test of time."
1,Quickly Discolors,"I received this cell phone case for Christmas and was quite pleased at the time--it's even nicer-looking than the picture. My only complaint was that the strap is very long, so if you like to wear your cell phone from your belt loop, it hangs down and flaps against your thigh awkwardly.Within a month of regular use, one of the little studs fell off and the case (especially the back) became worn and dirty-looking where the suede rubbed against my pants. It looks like I have used it for years. I am not at all pleased and will have to replace it."
3,Megaphone review,"Megaphone works mostly as promised. However, we need to use it in a gymnasium (which is real echo-y), and cannot turn the volume up enough to combat the echo. Most likely I cannot blame the megaphone, but the environment. I just wish I could make it louder. It shipped very fast!! May be better to use outside."
2,megaphone broke after 5 days of use,The megaphone broke after 5 days of use and I need to get another one?
1,Bullhorn - not as advertised.,"I could not get this product to operate at all. I thought it might be something I did not know about the operation. (however, all it needs is batteries). A friend who would know about such things also could not get it to operate. AND it did not come with an extra microphone. I considered it to be junk and false advertising by the manufacturer.The Amazon Market Place dealer was very easy to deal with. My money was promptly refunded plus the cost of return shipping."
5,This album will affect the rest of your collection,"Get this! Get it now. Occasionally someone drops a hiphop LP that makes you wonder why other artists cannot make an album like this. The beats from one song to another are a masterpeice. Illogic's verse on track 3 is superb. It sounds of new, sounds of old - just amazing lyrics/songwriting AND believe it or not - production! Get this!"
1,my wife is manipulative,"The passive-aggressive subtext is an interesting study in unacknowledged sexism. They make such a big deal that ""he"" means ""spouse"", but - look here! - they use ""one"" where they actually mean ""she"". And who can trust any book that purports to study and describe problems in marriage without any discussion of domestic violence or abuse? hmm. maybe it's because those aren't common marital problems, from the perspective of MEN.In terms of actual useful advice, here, I'll summarize: communicate your actual needs, and be honest about where they're not being met, and listen to your spouse when she does the same. That one sentence is the most helpful thing this book has to say."
5,"A terrifying story, very well told . . .","Once again, Ann Rule proves why she is one of the best. ""Lust Killer"" is a concise and insightful look into the life and crimes of serial killer Jerome Brudos. But more than that, it is a chilling look into the often forgotten realm of victimology. Think you're safe when you go to the mall at high noon? Read this book. Think a man who looks like a big dumb teddy bear can't possibly be a threat to you? Read this book. Think a chance encounter with some stranger in a typical middle-class neighborhood is no big deal? Read this book. Oh, and one more thing . . . be ready to look over your shoulder the next time you go shopping."
5,Packed with horror and suspense,"I loved this book. Ann Rule writes so that you feel as though you are there. The book begins with a recitation of the events as the police learned them; then after the killer was arrested, his confessions and the evidence gathered during searches provides unbelievable detail. Unless you already know the story of Brunos, you won't believe what happens, even after he's sentenced and in prison. This book is a strong message to everyone, especially young women, to be aware of your surroundings!"
4,Gripping!,"Not my favorite Ann Rule novel, but all her novels are so well written, if you are interested in true crime novels, this is the author to check out."
1,Overrated!,"I bought this book based on glowing reviews by a majority of readers; Ann Rule was touted as an outstanding writer. I found this book to be about as gripping as a newspaper article. Dull and boring. Sorry, Ann Rule fans.Now I am trying another of her books ""Every Breath You Take, and it is starting off even worse. I hope it gets better or my review on that one will be another grudging one star."
4,VERY GOOD BOOK!!!,"Ann as usual did an excellent job of writing this story, Giving the reader an insight into the dark psyche of the killer.I enjoyed reading this book."
3,An early effort by Ann Rule,"This is one of the earliest books written by Ann Rule, and one can tell. Ms. Rule hasn't yet honed her talent for drawing the reader into the world of the victim and the criminal. That's not to say that this is a bad book - far from it! It's just not quite as polished as Ms. Rule's later books. I have always enjoyed Ms. Rule's books, and I recommend this one, with the caveat that it is an early book."
4,lust killer,"The book was good. Just read it. If you know Ann's writting then you won't be disappointed at all. If this is your first time reading Ann, then hang on. Ann is able to take you to where horror lives. Her descriptions of the killings and killers are intriguing. The worse part is this is all true crime. Ann having the back ground in law enforcement is how this author is able to get so detailed. I won't write about what's in this book because you just need to read all of Ann's books. This may not be helpful but, you know what. I got started on Ann because I picked the book up and just started to read it. Now, go out there and read !!!"
4,Lust Killer,"Ann Rule delivers another chilling, true-crime story with Lust Killer. Often reality can be more fearful than fiction.Jerry Brudos was indeed a very sick individual with a hatred of women that started in early childhood. Some of the twisted things he did to his victims was nothing short of shocking. He felt no remorse for the young women he violated and killed.There is also a lesson to be learned by reading this shocking story: be aware of your surroundings, and those around you; fight, scream, or do anything you can to draw attention to yourself if you are in a threatening situation; never believe your kidnapper when he says he won't hurt you if you come along quietly.If you are a true crime fan, I would recommend this book!Book Hollow[...]"
3,Just OK.,I've read l lot of true crime books and this one is just OK. Perhaps I didn't like it much because aside from being a very sick human being there didn't seem to be anyone in his life that found him to have any redeeming qualities. Even the people in his life who saw potential had to admit that he did absolutely nothing to nurture it into a real livelihood. My heart goes out to the families of those women that he murdered and never showed any remorse for doing so. I hope his wife found the strength to build a life for herself and her children. May Brudos never be released from prison.
1,Just my opinion,"What a waste of even the miniscule amount I paid. Having read the last three books of Ted Bell, I was interested to learn more about the man. THIS IS NOT WHERE TO DO SO. I got more info off of Google just by searching his name. All they have done is copied parts of other reviews. Ted Bell is the BEST. This effort by someone else, is the WORST. Worthless in my humble, unimportant, I don't drive a Hummer, opinion."
2,Clipped,"verions of some of the songs make this a lousy buy. But I'm not what you'd call a huge Santana fan anyway. I like ""Oye Como Va"" a lot and thought that ""Soul Sacrifice"" at Woodstock was impressive, but mostly, Santana to me has been ah, not very interesting to listen to. I don't think much of Clapton either-all style and no substance. That they are both great guitarists I will not deny, but they make me sleepy. The discovery of wilder white noise has spoiled me. All the hits you know from the seventies are here, if not in their best form."
2,"Not bad, but 1998 ""Best of"" disc much more complete","I bought this CD a few years back and was fairly happy with it, but found the 1998 Best of Santana disc to contain a wider range of tunes. I personally enjoy the somewhat ""pop"" songs such as Open Invitation and Winning, which may not sound like classic Santana, put are melodic and entertaining nonetheless. Plus, the addition of She's Not There makes the later release a much better buy for the money, since it includes almost all the other songs from this disc."
4,Not Bad,"This isn't a bad album at all, has their three biggest hits ""Oye Como Va"", ""Black Magic Woman"" and ""Evil Ways"", so if you are looking to find those songs all in one tidy setting this is the place."
5,absolutly essential recurding,this is undoubtedly satan's gretest colection of songs9 pickthis up if you love all things rock an latin. SERIOUS!
1,Still Waiting,"I ordered 3 items on the same day, this item being one of them. I received the other two items from their seller, but have not received this one yet. I'm still waiting."
1,I Wouldn't Go Here,"This hits collection is a cheap,skimpy set that draws ONLYfrom the first Santana trilogy.Sure ""Oye Como Ve"",""Evil Ways""and ""Balck Magic Woman"" are undisputed classics but so are""Santana"",""Abraxas"" and ""Santana III"" as ALBUMS.Santana are really an album-oriented band anyway so what's the point here?"
1,Complete waste of money (allow me to explain),"The reason I give this album 1 star is not the compilation of music, which clearly deserves an easy 5 stars. But did anyone care to mention that almost every song is cut off or shortened? This album is 33 minutes long! Black Magic Woman ends at the beginning of the solo, Evil Ways is drastically shortened, as well as everything else. I wish I had known this before I wasted 18 dollars on this album. If this album had been complete, I would have praised it for everything it's worth, but in this case, it's worth absolutely nothing. Go buy the albums instead. Buying this album is like downloading 3/4 of every song and burning it onto an album. So if soundclips are what you're looking for, you might as well check out the clips here -trust me- the album is not much better."
2,Don't buy this album!,"Don't buy this album. Sure, it does contain some of Santana's greatest hits-- and I do love Santana's music-- but it's not the group's best collection album. I urge you to buy ""The Best of Santana"" (1998) instead. It has all the classics this disc contains, plus additional great hits from the later 70s and early 80s, plus much better sound quality on all tracks."
3,It Was Greatest Hits For Its Time,"One must realize before buying this CD, that the original music was released on LP in 1974 and it WAS his Greatest Hits for that time. But as you know, Santana has since propelled to the top of the charts again and again and again. These are studio versions of his early hits. And while they do sound great, nothing and I mean NOTHING compares to Santana live. Might I also suggest Santana Live in South America? Amazon.com sells it, and I think it gives his best performance of Black Magic Woman. As for this CD, the two biggest hits are Black Magic Woman and Evil Way's. But the rest of the CD is cool also. You are going to get that Latin sound. This is a combination of Head Music with Good Rock, great vocals and great rhythm mixed in. This is a CD to share with on a date, or just relax too."
2,"Get ""The Best of Santana"" instead.","If there's one thing I hate, it's when songs are cut short to be able to get played on the radio. Usually, the best part of the song gets cut. This album is no exception. An instrumental part of Black Magic Woman has been cut, and Gypsy Queen has been taken out completely. Jingo is about half as long, Evil Ways is cut short, and No One To Depend On isn't even here! Radio versions of songs suck, and should not be allowed on albums.It is highly recommended that you get The Best of Santana vol. 1 and 2 instead of this. You'll get the real songs, not some shortened radio edit versions. And you'll also get the actuall best of Santana, not just the commercial successes."
5,Power Paced Fitness Circle exercises,"Moira is the best fitness instructer; very soft spoken, and tells you how to do every move, as well as when to breathe in and out. She targets all parts of your body, arms, back, legs, inner thights, outer thighs, abs, and chest muscles. If you don't already have a Magic Circle, I would get the 14 inch for greater resistence. The circle adds just the right amount of resistence. I would like to get the Amazing Tone DVD next, with the little weight balls. Since I've been exercising for most of my life, I will buy the 3 pound balls instead of the 2 pound."
2,so so...,"Ok, the review by ""trend jewlery nut"" is dead on. I vouch for every single point about the book in their review. It is a decent read, and it IS written well, however, the author really needs to develop her characters better. The girl in the book is an absolute moron. Not to mention it completely urked me that after every sentence from the Native American characters that ended with a question mark, ended with an ""eh?"" after it. Ok, they're Comanche....not Canadian. Had a hard time really getting into the book because of all the unrealistic annoyances with the characters. Def better reads out there. This just did not have the ""wow"" factor i was looking for and would want to read again."
3,Comanche Moon,"Any Catherine Anderson book I have read I have always loved, but this one was not one that I cared for. It didn't have the same romance between the two characters and it was hard to ascertain how they would overcome their obstacles. It just seemed forced."
5,A Beautiful Love Story!,I can't say enough about this book. It has been a long time since I read a book where I wasn't able to put it down. This book is so well written. It captures your heart from the very start and doesn't stop until the end. I literally did not want the story to end! I am so looking forward to sequel.
2,Lame,"After seeing so much praise for this book I had thought this was a safe bet to read but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. I had to force myself to see this book through to the end. The heroine, Loretta, is what ruined this book for me. She was absolutely ridiculous and frustrating. By the first half of the book I had lost all sympathy for her. The hero is the typical alpha male but he really wasn't all that bad and truly had more honor than the heroine. By the end I didn't even care what happened to them. The most interesting part was reading the small parts that included the other tribal members in the village."
3,Disappointing.,Comanche life is well written and the hero worked well for me. The heroine however was an almost constant whiner. She didn't want the hero while she had him then wanted him desperately when she thought she had lost him - very unsatisfying and drawn out romance. Can't recommend this book. I struggled to care what happened at the end.
2,American Dissappointment,"I'm a big fan of the House Jacks, and I was really looking forward to hearing this album. Unfortunately, it did not deliver. The songs Austin wrote for the House Jacks were thought-provoking (my favorite was ""All Of My Life""), but also with a sense of hope. The sons on this album are one bummer after another. They're well-written, but I won't be listening over and over to this album."
2,Be Careful On What You Buy,"For Americans, please be aware that the DVD is region 2, meaning that it will not play in DVD players made for America. I bought this, waited weeks for the thing to ship, then got it and realized that the DVD is the wrong region.Also make sure that you are aware that there are two versions of this album. Domino UK and Domino USA have different versions.I didn't know that either until I bought this version.As for the music, I think it is not as good as I wanted it to be. The remixes are kind of trance music, not what I would expect from this band. I expected loud house style bass-driven anthems. As for the demos, unreleased tracks, and the edits.. the demos are horrible, the unreleased tracks don't sound like Test Icicles, and the edits seem very near the same as the originals.I think this should only be bought if you know that you can play the DVD and you are a big fan of test icicles and you want their stuff."
2,Competent but unmoving sci-fi,"This book is way too long and as other reviewers have pointed out, runs out of steam about half-way through.The concept of the Eater is quite interesting but the book comes across as more of a creative writing exercise than as a satisfying novel.Competently written but unmoving."
2,Poor Design,"The emails and shipment were outstanding. However, the quality of this media shelf leaves much to be desired. The base is too light; very prone to tipping. The instructions have a stupid solution to the problem: Nail a strap into your wall that attaches to the back of the shelf. However they forget to mention that you need to nail into a wall stud to be even remotely useful. Otherwise putting a hole into sheetrock won't help hold the shelf upright. The shelf assembles as two pieces that attach together, one atop the other. For my unit, the alignment of these pieces was visibly off. While I like that I can configure the space between each shelf, some shelves don't sit tightly on the metal pegs used to keep them level. Overall, as a consumer I was very disappointment in the unit's quality and design, especially considering the cost; I would recommend avoiding this product."
5,Excellent for the collector.,If you are a collector of Edison phonographs...you are aware that there are very particular difference between models. Frow helps you to identify your model...Ever curious about the cloth that covers the grill? This provides for you. Do you have a model without a grill...been there..atleast you have a picture to recreate it....good book.
2,Night of the Living Dead redux.,"A therapist gathers together a group of patients and their spouses for a weekend retreat. Meanwhile a group of militants on a hijacked plane suffer brain damage when their air pressure is lost. When the plane goes down nearby the Group Therapy session becomes prisoners of the now shambling, zombielike and quite murderous militants. Overly familiar material mixed with unsympathetic characters sinks Russo's rewrite of the NotLD story."
2,Make sure you have the right doll,This is made for the Madeline doll series. Not what I was expecting when I ordered it. I guess it is ok as far as doll clothes go. But I dont own a Madeline Doll.
1,CAUTION!!!,"Order this with extreme caution! I ordered it and the princess outfit for my daughter after searching under ""Dress-up"". I was so excited to find a reasonably priced dress-up outfit for my little girl. The package came today and was I disappointed! This is for the Madeline doll...not little girls! Nowhere does it say that. Now I am short presents for my daughter and Christmas is 4 days away. There is no time to get my money back before Christmas!"
5,Great Value,"I was really pleased with the vendor on this one. while the case was a little tattered, the disc was in good shape, so I got it for an awesome price. Now, the music on the other hand...was okay, but not what I expected from having heard previous Tilly and the Wall albums."
4,in love again fleur de la passion by YSL,"I LOVE ALL OF THE IN LOVES AGAIN, BUT THE ONE I LOVE THE MOST IS THE ORIGINAL. I NOW HAVE ALL THREE OF THEM AND LOVE THEM ALL. THE ORIGINAL IS VERY HARD TO FIND, THE OTHER TWO ARE VERY CLOSE AND WILL REPLACE IT WHEN I RUN OUT"
1,$8 to ship an 0 ring that weighs less than an ounce?,"Okay, I'm sick and tired of the shipping and handling gouge. It's abusive. We're all too used to it. Check with local stores. You'd have to live at the North Pole to make this item reasonably priced. Even then, I bet they'd send it First Class."
1,Hilariously bad,"""Eye of the Killer"" is one of those movies that falls in the category between bad and unwatchable: it's so bad, it's hugely entertaining. Kiefer Sutherland ought to be blacked out for the duration of the movie based on how much he drinks on screen, and the word ""Jabberwocky"" is said dozens of times by dozens of people. The plot is somehow hackneyed and confusing at the same time, the characters are totally unbelievable - it's just really, really, bad.That being said, if you're looking for a good drinking game: every time Kiefer drinks or someone says the word ""jabberwocky""..."
3,Typical,"This movie is a typical crime drama with a twist ending that can be figured out in the beginning. Neither the plot nor the characters are really that deep. There are some subplots that just make the movie feel very static. Such as the ex-wife sleeping with Mickey's boss. That doesn't fit very well and would have done better lying on the editing room floor. Although, I do have to say that the saving grace of this movie is Kiefer Sutherland."
3,"Disc 1- really good (4), disc 2- fair/not great (1 or 2)","The first disc of this box set (although maybe there should've been smaller paper for packaging like a regular 2-CD set, but with the same liner notes and pictures, to make it less expensive) shows why Dolly Parton is a legend. With really good recordings like ""Jolene,"" ""Down From Dover,"" and ""Just Because I'm a Woman,"" among others, she shows to be a great country singer and songwriter with an at times heartbreaking repertoire. The second disc shows why Dolly is a superstar. However, more pop recordings like ""Here You Come Again"" are sometimes good, but mostly fair and unindelible. If you can, borrow the first disc from someone and tape it or something. Then, you'll get one really disc that'll make you forget the downside of Dolly Parton's success."
4,"Again, Extremely Enjoyable","Not like Tubthumping at all, but definitely a lot like it. (Huh?)Very energetic and definitely a lot of fun. Absolutely infectious.I don't agree with their views a lot of the time, but that Microsoft slam really works (""Where do you want to go today? Somewhere you could never take me."")I may give this 5 stars in a week or so."
1,rubbish,"remember whan chumbawamba were good? this is not. they used to stand for something before they sold out for corporate america. now all they sing about is rubbish, something you nag about down at the local pub. sad."
1,WHAT YOU GET IS TRASH.,"They are best known for their only hit ""Tubthumping"", which was a infectious anthem song for their 15 minutes of fame.Well Chumba comeout with a new CD trying to cover the whole pop spectrum with 22 songs....here we go again with quantity instead of quality....This CD lacks any luster of their predecessor with boring and mundane songs that really have no sense of where they are going.Out of the 22 songs on this disaster there is a couple of standout songs ""Shake Baby Shake"", and ""Jesus In Vegas""....You would think with 22 songs their would be some more standouts.Furthermore the production throughout this CD goes up and down...I think they had more than one producer because some songs sound better produced than others.The CD is completely inconsistent and overall this CD stinks."
3,"Okay, but not thrilling...","This is a good album, but there is not much surprise in it. I think Chumba's high point was the Shhh!/Slap/Anarchy period, and this album doesn't have the anger or sonic thrills of that era (but then again, neither did the two albums before WYSIWYG). But the inevitable has happened: The Americanization of Chumbawamba. After spending what was probably too much time in the US promoting and playing Tubthumping, they have discovered and become obsessed with our dumb and huge pop/consumer culture. I don't know, but as an American, it strips some of their mystique away to hear them railing against such obvious targets as Elvis, Florida, etc. And maybe I've been listening to them for too long now, but aren't they treading on the border of self-parody?"
2,Not a practical book for everyday women,"Although Kevyn is a very talented make up artist, this book is for (1) the very young with no wrinkles (2) models (3) movie stars. I wish Kevyn would do a book for the everyday women. This would have been more helpful to me. I just can't see myself sprinkling glitter all over the character marks (also known as wrinkles) my eyelids or face. Kevyn, get real, there are more of us aging baby boomers out there that want practical advice!"
4,Great book,"This book is my second favorite of Kevyn Aucoin's three books (The Art of Makeup and Face Forward are his two others). Making faces shows the different types of effects that can be created through the application of make-up. It has practical models as well as those perhaps more suitable for theatrical make-up artists (Madame Butterfly, etc.) I feel the book impresses upon one the power of make-up.I am an absolute beginner at this - actually his books were the first fashion books I've ever owned. I've never even read a fashion magazine, either, so I feel confident that any one can find his books helpful."
5,Making Faces is a MUST HAVE book for makeup!!,"This book is a must have! As a certified makeup consultant, I'm constantly learning new methods of applying makeup to achieve certain looks. Making Faces shows you how to create all types of looks on different types of people. Kevin AuCoin is incredible. There are many makeover pictures. You can believe what Kevin can do with makeup. He transforms people into anything they want to be! It's amazing. I take this book with me everywhere I go. My customers love it! It gives them great ideas and looks to try out. I would recommend this book to anyone. It's great for anyone from beginners to advanced makeup artists. The looks are varied from basic natural looking makeup to dramatic evening and costume makeup! This book is a must have!!"
3,Great Tips. Pictures not realastic,this book was good but the picture peoples makeup was makeup that you would not wear on an everyday basis. the pictures were good and he showed you how to do it but you wouldnt want to do it anyway becuase it was so bold and kind of scary. The part in the begining was very helpful he talkeed about what each brush did and where there used and what he recomended with the techniques and stuf so... yeah you decide
3,Kevyn's book is easy to follow,"I found the photos facinating and I enjoyed Kevyn's writing style - very honest! If I'm not mistaken, his beautiful sister Carla is on Alley Mc Beal (Billy's new secretary). If not, the girl sure looks like Carla! After I read about 3 chapters I got a hold of my tweezers and followed his suggestions and made an easy and noticeable improvement. I look forward to reading the other chapters !"
2,Not the book to learn how to apply makeup for beginner or if you want detailed instruction.,"I purchased book years ago before his passing after an appearance on Oprah. He does FABULOUS makeup and this book is more for admiring that....how he can transform celebrites like T-boz, Gweneth Paltrow,etc. He gives you very basic info but not detailed instructions like instead of saying get MAC such and such color lipstick or Nars such and such colored blush he says taupe colored lipstick or orangey shade blush, descriptions like that.....not good if you don't know what blush is orangey or if you need something warm or cool, etc...More high level for maybe an aspiring makeup artist with plenty of makeup experience. Haven't found a good book for makeup application but there are several great tutorials online...you can see real time application and exact products to purchase to achieve a look. More for admiring not teaching. Recommend going online until you find a better how-to book."
3,Lovely photos,The photos are wonderful. I am a makeup fanatic and so enjoy looking at makeup. I only gave 3 stars because the techniques were not practical for a middle-aged woman with saggy lids and jowls!!
4,Great Visual Makeup Guide!,"The Book provides a new dimension in makeup application and techinique. I've had this book for over year or so, and I find myself referring back to it quite often. It's indeed a indispensible read with stunning photographs and brilliant visuals. Being a novice in makeup application, this book gave me a a whole new insight on the variety of makeup techniques that was used to achieve a certain desired effect; ranging from goth, mod, hollywood glam, all the way to the neutral pallette (for simpletons like myself). Even if one doesn't wear makeup, this book will defintely inspire you to do so."
4,Making Faces,It was a gift well received! My granddaughter was pleased to receive it and is using it and getting raves.
5,Love it,"First time I looked through this book I knew I had to have it. It's got alot of different, how tos, etc"
4,Inspirational,"Lots of great tips and photos for inspiration. The best lesson is that make-up is not about rigid rules, its about experimenting and having fun."
5,Definitely satisfied!,"My product arrived in a timely manner, well packaged, and in the conditioned promised. I was very satisfied, and would buy again."
2,Very Basic,I received the book and it was large. Larger than I was expecting so I was excited expecting to see lots of nice pictures and details. In a way I did get that. However I found a lot of the pictures to be kind of dull and chalky. There were pictures of women that looked plain. Even with the make up. They didn't look pretty to me. The colors were bland and the skin very pale. Just a covering of paleness on the skin. Add lipgloss nicely done hair and that's basically this book picture for picture. Also it told you obvious things like using concealer and lipgloss and mascara erm...der. :/ I don't know I was looking for maybe a collection of colors that would go great for certain eyes and skin types and different looks with those colors. Also it doesn't name anything specific. Like what kind of concealer?? What color are you using on the woman's skin?? How much is it?? Honestly a girl's magazine is better and will tell you more than this book.
4,Great book,I like the book I just think it needs to be updated since it has very old pictures and actresses. Still has great pictures and explains how to creat great looks so I liked it after all.
2,This book are just ok,"I had the 2 books of Kevyn Aucoin. After reading page by page, and reading many books of makeup. That one are very old styles techniques of makeup. No trends looks of makeup. There have a basic makeup looks. Not fashion makeup. Good for someone looking for sample style/looks.You can found others books betters then this!Only thing I like from this book is because they had the chart of contouring & highlight.But there was not the best explanation for contouring & highlight and not the best techniques.I am expecting more on this book before I have it. I am a little disappointed after reading page by page this book.This are not the best book you can have.I suggest this book:Makeup guide by Rae Morris.Thanks,"
5,Excellent Vendor,Product was exactly as described and shipped quickly. Would definitely use again. Thanks very much!
4,an incredibly artistic book,"Making Faces is an excellent book. However, it might not be what you expect. This book is wonderful provided you are looking for something a little more outlandish, extravagant, or theatrical. It focuses on color, mood, and the art of makeup. Making Faces also has sections devoted to: shadowing,(the use of light and dark to make features appear slimmer or bolder) as well as a method to change eyebrow shape,(with the use of wax and heavy makeup) and other professional techniques. If you expect to find more than a display of Kevin's work, some rather interesting aproaches to beauty, and quite a few beautifully artistic photographs, this book may not be what you want. Yet, if you'd like a change or a different perspective in the world of makeup, go for it!"
4,"Over-rated, but a good read....","The pictures were simply stunning, which I believe has more to do with the photographers than it does with Kevyn Aucoin himself. I personally did not find any terribly useful makeup advice and found that he had little to no foundation in his techniques... I come to this conclusion because he's constantly talking about ""freedom"" and such. I did enjoy the make-overs of the celebreties immensely, and would have bought the book just for the pictures alone. This is a wonderful book to have if you don't expect too much out of it."
3,Not what I expected,"I was not too impressed with this book. I was expecting more details to be provided on how to achieve certain looks. Step by step instructions, with pictures included, would have been extremely helpful. After I purchased the book, a friend of mine showed me Bobbi Brown's Makeup Manual...I was upset that I didn't purchase her book instead of this one...her book provided information on what MUA's should carry in their kit to the proper way to clean brushes. Don't get me wrong, this book had some good information, but not enough for me to feel more enlightened and empowered as a MUA."
2,A great Coffee Table book,"Kevyn Aucoyn is a wonderful, talented artist and an incredible human being-and this is a lovely collection of ""made over"" celebrities who (like so many of us)also adore Kevyn. Not a practical book for the ""day to day"" looks you can quickly use as you rush out of the house. Buy it for the celeb pics (and keep it on your coffee table or in the bathroom)-and get Bobbi Brown's book for real life make up tips."
4,"My favorite how-to, with a ton of ideas and tips.","With this book, you get introduced to makeup and how it works. Then, you get information on what to use it with and how to apply it, featuring illustrated guides and photo shoot examples. Kevin basically lets you know just about everything that can be done with the complexion, eyebrows, eyes, eyelashes, cheeks and lips.Some of the instruction is advanced - for example, it explains how to cover your eyebrows completely, and draw new ones on. But most of it is for regular lighting and normal life. There are more tricks and ideas in here than any magazine you've ever read. Kevin was one of Hollywood's best and I'm glad he revealed his secrets and techniques for others to use, before he died.I'm not giving this book 5 stars, because there's something important that a reader can't gain by reading the book -- skills with practice. The information is only good for people who get good at using it."
5,The greatest book!!!,This is a wonderful book. It tells you how to apply make-up and explains all of the make-up tools. He is wonderful at make-up and transfers this into his book. Because of his death his books and tips will be even more remembered and cherished. he shows you how to acomplish the innocent look and other such looks. He shows differnet techniques for doing make-up to make it look more stunning.
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"Kevyn's voice in this book is so nice and not condescending, that half the fun was just reading his anecdotes. The transformations he effects on people are amazing, just look at the pages with his sister Carla!The looks presented toward the end are just amazing, the people are mostly unrecognizable, but the first part talks about make-up for you and me. Do you want to spotlight your eyes? Try the Julia Roberts smoky look, I did and amazed myself!I also like that Kevyn doesn't use brand names or specific shades, I can't afford $50 eyeshadow, so I have to work with what I can, or with a shade that I prefer, and he allows for that. It's all about your choices and what you want to do.And that teacher's note at the end is so sweet...."
3,Not What I Expected,"If your looking for a teenage makeup book, this wouldn't be my first recommendation. This book was more about the history of makeup and had a few makeovers in it, but it wasn't really what i was lookin for; a book with makeup instructions and tips of teenagers, but this book was really for an older person"
1,why are there so many 5 stars?,"I purchased this book due to the 230 of the ""5 stars"" reviews. Much respect to the late Kevin Aucoin, but this book does not deliver much of makeup tips/tricks. This book should be rename as Photoshop 101 because all of the gorgeous pictures in here are massively ""photoshoped"". I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
2,Ehhhh......,Not very impressed with this or any of the books I ordered from Kevin Aucoin..... I have read much better.
4,GREAT BOOK; COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER,"THIS BOOK IS GREAT! COVERS EVERYTHING ABOUT MAKEUP, EVEN HOW TO DO SHADING TO MAKE A NOSE LOOK SMALLER! THE ONLY THING I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT THE AUTHOR DOES NOT SAY WHAT KIND OF MAKEUP HE IS USING ON THE MODEL. FOR INSTANCE I LIKED ""THE BOMBSHELL"" LOOK WHERE THE MAKEUP ARTIST MADE LISA MARIE PRESLEY LOOK LIKE MARILYN MONROE. I WAS THINKING, IF LISA MARIE PRESLEY CAN LOOK LIKE MARILYN MONROE, THEN SO CAN I. I HAD LONG BROWN HAIR LIKE RAQUEL WELCH IN HER YOUNGER YEARS & I CUT IT OFF & BLEACHED IT BLONDE, LIKE MARILYN. BAD IDEA. EVEN THOUGH I FOLLOWED ""THE BOMBSHELL"" LOOK DIRECTIONS, BLEACHED & CUT MY HAIR, I STILL DO NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THAT PICTURE. I HAD NO CLUE WHAT COLOR MAKEUP TO BUY! I THINK IF YOUR INTERESTED IN COPYING ONE OF THE LOOKS IN THIS BOOK YOU SHOULD TAKE IT TO A PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST, BECAUSE EVEN SOMEONE WHO HAS SOME SKILL WILL MOST LIKLEY NOT BE ABLE TO COPY THE LOOK THEY ARE GOING FOR."
5,Fast and items was in prefect condition,I received the book fast and it was great. The book was in great condition and I am learning a lot of looks.
5,"From a fellow artist, I can say I only wish I got tomeet him","I am also a Makeup Artist in Los Angeles, where makeup artists are on every corner, and I must say Kevin is/was a true talent. When I read his heartfelt words, I realize he's not only a genius artist, but the most open-minded humanitarian as well. Him AND his work are truely inspirational...his art, I personally think, puts other makeup books to shame. From a proffesional standpoint I think his book is extremely good to have but his book will also be useful to the everyday person as he goes into alot of different helpful techniques. His book is amazing-so if you love makeup, go get it!"
5,Inspiration and Instruction!,"This is one of those books you buy on Amazon because of the high recommendations and appreciate for the amazing illustrations as well as the information within. The makeover transformations of celebrities is astounding, especially when you realize that it doesn't really matter how you look without makeup, but that you can look fabulous with the right application. Kevyn Aucion uses color and style, rather than specific cosmetics, to create whatever personna he sees for each woman. A great ""picture book"" and an excellent reference!"
5,Marvelous Book,I bought this book for my daughter who heard about it through another author. She got it out of the library and kept bringing it back late so I decided she needed her own. She adores old movies and glamour of the old days. She is just wild about this book. She learned a lot about make-up and she has mastered quite a few of these styles herself. It's a wonderful book.
4,The ultimate makeup book,"Making faces is the ultimate makeup book. It is full of wonderful photos of a variety of makeup styles from everyday makeup to glamorous looks. The book also gives the reader detailed how to instructions on how to achieve the desired looks, and also informs the reader on what kinds of makeup products work the best. It also has wonderful before and after makeover pictures. What a book!"
5,Kevyn Aucoin's Making Faces is a must have for everyone.,I was not a wearer of make-up nor was I interested in make-up books until I picked up Making Faces at a friends house. I immediately bought the book and haven't let it out of my sight since. It is well written and beautifully photographed. Kevyn Aucoin has also made it easy for the beginner to use this book and make them very capable. I would recommend this book to everyone.
4,"Calendar as a step by step action guide to ""Making Faces""","At first reaction, this calendar was a disappointment since it has nothing that is not in Kevyn's book ""Making Faces"". Those ""obsessed"" with makeup, from fashion magazine editors to ""posters"" and ""lurkers"" on the newsgroup alt.fashion can never get enough of Kevyn's work. Upon careful observation, several of the monthly photos are different views than what is published in the book. Also the idea of having the different makeup techniques broken down on a semiweekly basis may prove to be an interesting guided systematic learning process to trying different cosmetic application techniques."
4,A Really Beautiful Book,"Not really what you would call a resource or manual...but, very pretty and nicely put together. It's a show book, more than anything...not really a technique tool. His talent is clear, but this isn't on the same par as say Bobbi Brown's book. He's a wonderful artist and his book represents that. A nice addition to a photography/coffee table selection."
4,"This book won't leave you ""Making Faces""","When I picked up ""Making Faces"", the first thing that I thought was that there are a million books that are supposed to help you make your face prettier and I have seen them all. The instructions leave you confused with gobs of makeup all in the wrong places. With ""Making Faces"" I was dead wrong. This is not another book with instructions that leave you wondering where your browbone is. Everything is illustrated and explained so well, that there is no room for mistakes, just clear instructions for specific looks that are nothing short of spectacular."
3,Not impressed.,The book has a few good make overs for the common women but it has way too many magazine over dramatic make overs which cannot be used to get out of the house unless you are going to a Halloween party. I feel that this book is worth no more than five dollars as you can probably get the same information for free on the internet.
2,Good beginners Tips,This book is definitely from the 90's lots of older looks but some are definitely simple and timeless and can be worn now. Def worth a look at.
5,Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin,Kevyn Aucoin was a premier makeup artist. A genius with makeup he shows us how to use makeup in an exceptional manner. He is an excellent teacher and his work is absolutely beautiful. Anyone can benefit from his lessons in this book. I miss him.
5,Great Book!,Love the way Kevyn shows you how to achieve the looks on the pictures. This book is awesome for beginners! I definitely recommend it!
2,interesting but outdated - came out in '97,"This book includes styles for both supermodels and average-looking people. However it was published more than a decade ago (copyright '97) and styles have changed since then. This is most notable in the use of ""outlined"" lips or super-dark lipstick on about 90% of the photos in the book. The ""edgy"" pictures are even more dramatic and outdated. All in all, an interesting book, but not very usable for makeup tips in '08."
5,"Making Faces, wow","Making Faces is an excellent book. However, it might not be what you expect. This book is wonderful provided you are looking for something a little more outlandish, extravagant, or theatrical. It focuses on color, mood, and the art of makeup."
2,The makeup in this book is totally unrealistic and unnatural,"Kevyn aucoin was definately an artist, but I didn't like this book. The makeup he presents is too obvious and fake. The pictures are excellent but he offers little step by step advice. The makeovers are great, in pictures. I would be scared to find someone with that much makeup in the street. This book is certainly missing the real-life/real-makeup element. If he was the master behind so many great looks on celebrities (i.e. Gwyneth Paltrow), why didn't he show us how to achieve their natural but polished style? Maybe he didn't want to give his secrets away!!!"
2,"Ok, for the $",Pages are very fragile and there is a blur on the cover. Possibly stained. It was supposed to be a gift but I'll have to order another for her.
2,"overwhelming, out of date","I think this book must be for looks in the 80s and 90s. Totally out of date and the information is cluttered. The looks were not good either, unless you like bland or covered in glitter... and nothing in between."
4,Great for Inspiration,"I was excited to receive this book since I had always admired Kevyn Aucoin's amazing work. I thought the introduction to the book was wonderful. For me, as a how-to guide the book falls short (yes, even with the explanations and drawings). Somehow I cannot get my make-up to ever look like the photos. But as a book to draw inspiration from this is a great book! I am glad that Aucoin's work and legacy can be preserved with this publication (and with his other books as well)."
5,Very Beautiful,This book is a must have. The makeup artist shows real celebrities and how he can transform their looks into another celebrity its crazy but wonderful. LOVE LOVE LOVE.
2,No so helpful,I thought this book would give me all the tips and tricks to become an expert at applying my makeup. Not so. It is pretty basic and I did not find it to be very helpful.
3,Not for beginners,"I bought this book because I don't have a lot of prowess with makeup at all, and I wanted to develop some skills using basic tools. This book, filled with beautiful pictures of beautiful people, assumes a basic knowledge of makeup and a steady hand for application. Maybe eventually I'll make more use of it, when I master the simple steps from other sources of information."
2,Not for the average schmoe,"I must say I am surprised at the reviews! It's a great book, if you're in the profession of makeup. None of the looks are fit for the average 30 woman who's going to the local mall or to work. This looks are for professional models on the runway. He tells you have to achieve the look, it's true, but he leaves out little things, like sometimes you can clearly see the model is wearing eyeliner, but he fails to put that in the steps to get the look. I had fun with the book when I first got it, but now it's gathering dust in my closet. I guess it depends on what looks you are going for and how seriouse with make-up you are."
2,Not Really Useful...Or Applicable,Techniques which I wanted to employ were not present in this book. Most applications were not applicable to me. Also I didn't care for the extra stories. I just wanted to learn.
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed with this book. Simply put it does not contain nearly enough information pertaining to technique or application. It is mostly a tribute to Kevin's artistry and the man was a true artist. However it provides little in the way of instruction or guidance when attempting to replicate these looks yourself.The book is filled with pictures of celebrities and supermodels wearing over the top makeup, makeup that the average woman will never attempt or come close to achieving. In fact, most of the applications shown in this book are best left to true make up professionals unless you wish to look like a clown (or like you just left the MAC counter after the sales girl finishes applying every product they have to your face).Stunning pictures of already stunning women with little instruction."
4,I needed this book! Why didn't anyone hand this to me sooner?!,"I'm 30 years old and the only make up I know how to do properly is one eyeliner technique. Sad isn't it? ;)This book is filled with vital information about the basics, and a bit more advanced, of how to apply make-up. Obviously getting the result he has pictured takes practice, but since acquiring this book, I've never looked better. I enjoy putting on makeup now, whereas before I hated it. I've always had the same look. (on dark features) Black eyeliner, maybe some eye shadow and lip balm. He's got me wearing lipstick! He's the female friend I've never had, one who knows how to apply make-up and how to explain it!This also makes a great coffee table book for people into theater, make-up, fashion, or any of the arts."
5,Excellent book!!!,This book was my inspiration and my guide in all matters concerning the makeup!.Excellent!.Hardcover is better!
3,In my opinion,"This book is alright. I really enjoyed the beginning, which was basic techniques, and just basic facts on make up. I'm a make up amateur, but was still impressed that I learned something new. Once I got into the different ""Faces"" of make up, I kind of got bored. It seems as though after the first few types on full faces, the make up just varies by color, but not really technique. Everyone knows how to swap colors for each technique. With that, I found the whole second half of the book pretty useless. Nice pictures though."
3,Better for beginners,"I was really excited to receive this book after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon. However, after reading it, I did not really feel that I had learned anything new. I have read countless magazines and online articles, and almost everything in the book can now be learned for free via the internet (blogs, websites, Youtube). The pictures are really nice and high-res, but I wish there were more details for specific makeup shades or brands. I'm glad that the book was pretty inexpensive, because I don't see myself referring to it that much in the future--in retrospect, I wish I had looked it over at the library or bookstore before buying it. The book would be most helpful for people who do not know much about makeup."
5,PROFOUNDLY INSIGHTFUL,Ms. Conta has given intellectual perception and emotional depth to the roller coaster ride of young love. She writes with great intensity about matters of the heart and demonstrates wisdom and insight beyond her years. Very gifted in her ability of self-expression. Most can relate to her own journey. I highly recommend this read for women of all ages.
1,Review for Super Octain,"I bought two of these from [a local toy store] with the intention of racing them. The problem is, while they look fast, the're painfully slow. One hundred bucks is short money for an RC, but again, this one is just too slow to enjoy. For the same money you can get the Radio Shack Lightening 2, which is much faster, and uses a hobby class standard 7.2V battery. [The local toy store] was excellent though, in that they took them back with no problem."
3,Super?? Octane,"My son received this car for Christmas. We took it to his school to let him race it around. By looking at it, you would think that it was ""super"" fast. It isn't. It goes, but not as fast as you would expect with it being named ""Super Octane"".The battery was charged for 4 hours as directed.We took an ""Edgerunner"" car with us. The two cars hit and the Super Octane's suspension broke. Nothing happened to the Edgerunner. I was able to fix the car, but I had to disassenble the front end. Luckily we found all the parts."
1,it is bad.,When I fist got this car it went about 15 mph. Two days after that it lost half of it's speed. Then I ran it into a curb and half of it's bumber broke off. So I do not recomend this car because it is a piece of junk.
2,Defender/Super Octane,"I recently purchased this r/c car thinking that it would be better than some other ones that are half of the price, I think I was wrong. After charging the battery for 4 hours I played with it for a few minutes before it bumped into a wall, in doing so it knocked something loose in the motor and it began to tick/knock. I then returned it for another one...The vehicle is not nearly as fast as I thought it would be, and it has the largest turning radius of any r/c vehicle I have owned. I will now be returning the r/c car because this is one very overpriced r/c car. I will be doing more research before I purchase another one."
3,Reference to American Psycho,"Though it looks intriguing, I have not read this book. I came across a reference to a similar title in the chapter titled ""Yale Club"" in Brett Easton Ellis' novel, ""American Psycho"", a must read for anyone interested in '90s East Coast sartorial arcana and serial mayhem. A character poses a question, ""Can a sweater vest be worn with a suit?"" The answer lies in the pages of (the presumed fictional book) ""A Guide to Quality in Menswear"". Perhaps it is in Boyer's book as well."
3,Being Tool doesn't make it great,When I got into Tool it was when nima came out. Maybe that is why I really don't think that Opiate is that good of an album. Yes I own it and yes I love it but it recieves very little play time when you compare it to the rest of Tool's work. Really the best part is not the music (with the exception of Opiate) it's the live feel this CD has.Any one who has not gotten into and learned to fully appreciate Tool should NOT buy this album. Wait until the band fully grows on you and then pick it up so you can see where they came from.
3,I'll be honest here...,"This is a great CD, but compared to Tool's other three CD's, this one stands idle. Let's go through the CD's, shall we?-OPIATE: Nice, heavy, but not quite as deep as the later stuff.-UNDERTOW: This is a great CD. Not the deepest, but heavy and powerful nonetheless.-AENIMA: This is their best CD. It is heavy, angry and deep, just what a Tool fan would expect. Get it if you don't have it already ;)-LATERALUS: This is an odd CD. The songs average about 8 minutes long each, and they go from loud and then the rest of the song is soft.So unless you are a die hard fan, skip this and just get the other three."
5,opiate,Let me start off by saying that the first time I heard tool I thought they sucked. This was a conclusion drawn by many first timers to tool. To fully enjoy this music takes a longing to first of all. This is the last tool album i purchased and while it isn't the greatest one it is better than anything you will find on any radio station that has a top 40 format. If I were to recomend a first tool cd it would have to be nima wich has the best songs and is proably the greatest album ever.
3,Short and Powerful,"The songs are full-speed-ahead alternative rock. Simple, basic and catchy. Explicit lyrics are used where they get the greatest impact. I would expect nothing less. Buy this album if you cen get it cheap because it is an EP with only 6 songs. 6 great songs."
4,BANG,"Anger, racism, live sets, what more could one ask for? This one has a rawness and purity never to be equaled. With tons of emotion and the spooky crescendoes which sealed their fame this album is nonstop in your face genius.(4.7)"
4,"4.5 starts, actually","If you are new to Tool, and want to hear where the band came from, get this. It is much more trash-style than Tool's other stuff, but it is still great. The song Opiate is the best indication of the route the band would take with later albums. All the members of the band do a great job with their role. Highly recomended."
5,A Sleeper that has become one of my Favorites,"This disk is a sleeper. You will buy it, listen to one or two songs on it and then relegate it to your dusty CD rack. During the next big snow storm when you get tired of all your other CD's you drag this one out to listen to that one song you like. One song leads to Two, and Two leads to Six. Before you know it you are saying to yourself ""Where has this disk been all my life?"".It happened to me and it will happen to you..."
5,Their best cd,"This cd plain out rocks! It is Tool's hardest, powerful and to the point album. There are no slow and songs you just want to turn off on this album. They're all good. It is the perfect album to listen to when you just feel really p***** off at somebody, or you feel like banging your head. And you'll just have to do some serious head bangin' to these kick ass songs."
5,A great start,"Opiate is Tool's first big release, and surprisingly, for them anyways, it is pretty acessible. The songs on here aren't half as long as those contained on ""Lateralus"" and ""Aenima"" but they still have that distinct Tool attitude. ""Sweat"" is a great opener, it has great lyrics and is really energetic. ""Hush"" is one of those really short tracks, clocking in at under 3 minutes. My favorite song on the whole CD would have to be the title track, ""Opiate."" I mean, who can forget the chorus? (Deaf and dumb and blind and born to follow/What you need is someone strong to guide you) You can't go wrong with the Opiate EP, it may only be 6 tracks long, but it is definetly a worthy buy. If you don't own it already, you need to get up and go to the music store right now and find yourself a copy."
1,"""Opiate"" by BMG Sony Europe","This CD is made in Germany. Contents is great as always with Tool, however quality of recording itself is far worse than other Tool CDs I have (all of them made in US).If you want to buy ""Opiate"" go for US Volcano edition instead of German cr...p."
4,A great breakout album for the acid rock kings.,"Tool in 1992 a then unknown band with vocalist Manyard JamesKeenan put out this impressive debut album, to someone who doesnot like agressive lyrics it would probly sound like loud ranting.For the many fans who love Tool like me it was diffrentand suprisingly good for there first shot, although not as goodas undertow or aneima or lateralus it has enough goods to showthat this band was not to be underestimated with titles likeJerk Off and Opiate.Short songs in comparison with there otherreleases but the songs are original even if they do sound hostile.Tool has been going on strong still for 14 years withthere latest release 10,000 days.It is worth buying for anyone who adores Acid Rock."
5,GREAT ALBUM FOR THERE FIRST ONE,THIS CD WILL BLOW THERE NEW CD AWAY.IT'S A LOT COOLER AND MORE METAL.
4,This great album has live and studio tracks.,"The first album (EP) by the band gives clear indication what Tool would become - tight playing, dramatic, influencial and mesmeric. The best tracks on it are the live ones, I have never heard a more accomplished playing of heavy rock. You can hear all types of influences - Rollins Band, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath etc. Lead singer Maynard James Keenan performs in his trademark manner, sliding from insectile to jet blast power. Tool impress without having to shock, and shock without being predictable."
5,Anger put poetically plus great instruments and vocals...,"A raw and powerful album, the quartet outdid themselves early, releasing a marvelous EP before they even knew what to do with themselves. This is a great CD, possibly their best."
2,wiccans(new witchcraft) at their best,"I got this album and immediately liked the heavy bass playing, but the lyrics were controversial along with the art displayed in the album. ""A part of me"" is an anti-military song in my opinion and as far as showing the priest rising to power on the cover, it is very wiccan--a new form of craft."
1,Waste of money,"This cd sucks, the music all sounds the same, the vocals sound just as bad live as they do in studio, the riffs are generic, the lyrics are dumb and the sound over all sucks."
2,Disappointed,"My advice -- avoid this product. Within three months of light use, it began skipping ever more frequently. Within six months it had deteriorated to the point that I had to stand completely still to avoid the skips. So much for portable listening.For the price I expected durability. What I got was a disappointment."
5,A great player. A value at this price.,"This is a great looking and sounding player. It's much more sleek than the pictures seem to represent.The sound quality is great. The headphones that are delivered do sound great, but, hey, maybe it's just me, but they really make my ears warm. It's almost like wearing earmuffs. If I were to make one suggestion on how to create more value/quality to this product offering, I would suggest Sony try different headphones, or better yet, offer a choice to those purchasing on the Web.In addition to the quality of the sound, you also have a plethora of options when using the player. It's easy to program your own playlist, set one song to repeat, or put the player in ""hold"" status so that you don't either accidentally turn it off or on.Enough said. This is a player I would recommend to any music lover."
2,Not something I would buy again,"Sony basically makes a pretty lousy portable cd player. I got one for Christmas a year and a half ago, and it might as well be dead. I treat it very well, but somehow :A.) It skips excessivelyB.) Right side of headphones don't workC.) Cannot read disc half of the timeD.) Even when I pop in a BRAND NEW cd, and the discman isn't bumping around, it STILL skips.E.) I'll be listening to a cd and sometimes the cd player will just stop for no reason (fresh batteries, mind you) and it happens A LOT!There are some good sides though, it has a GREAT battery life and the sound WAS good while it lasted.If I were you though I would stay away from this brand, another brand to avoid is RCA. Try Philips Magnavox, they work REALLY good."
3,"If You Want To listen To A CD Alot, This One Isn't For You","I wish I could write a great review for this. But I really can't. The rating I'm giving it is very generous. We'll start with the sound. It's just plain OK, thats it. The headphones are pretty cheap, so they don't help the sounds depreciating quailty besides. The skip protection is good (25-35sec.) The battery life somewhat good about 15-20, mabey not even that....the quality just isn't their. I had it for about 4 months(bought in 5/6/00) after I bought it, it was goofing up on me. When it was bumped or not, it would just turn off. This was very, very annoying because your listening to a song and it quits, you turn it on again, and it quits a minute or two later...The bottom line, DO NOT BUY IT...You'll just waste your money..."
1,DON:T BUY THIS!!!!!!!,"This CD player is nothing but a pieace of junk. I've had mine for about a year and and the skip protection is not that great. And if you plan on using it in the winter outside (I like to listen to music walking to class, i am in college) then this one won;t help. If it is even RWEMOTELY cool outside it will shut off on it's own all the time making it impossible to listen to anything. Now...I dunno, but CD players are not supposed to do that...especially a portable one ment to be carried around. DO NOT BUY THIS! It's a waste of money!!!!!!!!"
1,for 60 bucks air sounds better than this skipping cd player,unless you are the type of person who buys pet rocks and pretty toilet plungers DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't want to give the thing 1 star but the form made me
3,"Did not fit, but otherwise decent value for $","Got this for my truck console, but did not fit the right way. Returned to Amazon with no fuss. Console was ok, as expected for this price. Amazon no fuss return policy is really nice."
2,Disappointing,"This was a difficult read and very dated. The first few hundred pages were ok, but then it got bogged down in long winded monologues, with the same theme being reinforced over and over again. Ayn Rand is a wonderful author, but this book was about 400 pages too long."
2,"Tries to be funny, but misses for me","Bradshaw spoke at one of my wife's company's functions and she said he was a great speaker, so I was looking forward to this book. However, his style does not seem to transfer to the written page. He tries hard to be likable and funny, but I rarely laughed at his stuff and only managed a few smiles."
2,Not up to par,"This is arguably the worst of the Fred Astaire movies. The script is ridiculous, Minelli's ""innovative"" sets and figures are overblown and irritating, and the music is astonishingly bad. Yes, there is ""Coffee Time,"" but how much of a song is that? Try playing it and you'll fall asleep the second time through. I've never understood the studio's abandonment of Lucille Bremer. She was a fine actress and a capable dancer. Moreover, she was a raven haired beauty. (Her singing in this film was dubbed by one Trudy Erwin, heaven knows why.) Astaire was fine, but the dancing was outside his range and often feels labored. Comedy relief? Depth? Memorable moments? Forget it. This film bombed at the box office and hasn't improved with age."
1,yolanda and the thief,Unable to review as product was defective and returned for exchange. Currently waiting for new item and hope it arrives soon. Displeased with DVD labeled Yolanda and the Thief and it was instead an old black and white silent movie.
2,The least of the Fred Astaire movies,"After a long search for Yolanda and the Thief, I finally obtained a copy. It wasn't a total disappointment because there were a couple of wonderful dance numbers but on the whole the movie is a waste of time in spite of the efforts by Astaire and Frank Morgan, both of whom gave their usual professional performances."
4,Violets are Blue,"Loved this movie! For those of us who grew up the on the east coast, this was like going home...going back in time...bringing back those long lost memories of youth, freedom, first love, the beach. Movie set was in ""old"" Ocean City, Maryland, and portrays a young woman returning home and finding her ""long lost love"" who now belongs to someone else. Upon seeing him, love is rekindled....and the question is...can we go back? Can we pick up where we left off? In the end...reality sets in...and with broken hearts, they once again go their separate ways. A must see for those who have ever loved and lost."
5,Wow so much like life...,This movie so moved me because it is so much like life...If you do not believe in romance and what could have been...Then this is not the movie for you...
2,Violets Are Blue,"I was somewhat disappointed upon receiving the video.It is quite worn and the first few minutes of film is blury and difficult to see.To say the least, I suppose my expectations wre not fulfilled with this video. ...Karen..."
5,Great memories!,Another Kevin Kline forgotten classic. Just as good as I remembered it to be. Truly hold up against the test of time.
4,"Bad cop, not bad movie","I am a big Andy Lau fan and watched this movie years ago.Hong Kong singer/actor/superstar Andy Lau stars as Lee Rock, a real life person who was one of the Hong Kong Police most corrupt policeman in the 60s. This story traces his past as a wide eyed honest rookie to becoming one of the dirtiest cops in the department.The movie makes him out to be a sort of a good guy who was forced under circumstances to turn bad but he actually has a good heart. While the real life Lee Rock was probably an all out bad guy, Lau plays him as a very sympathetic figure.As a standard Hong Kong movie, the movie has very good gun fight scenes. The story was not bad and the action sequences were just as good. Definitely a must buy if you are into Hong Kong movies."
5,"Great, Essentioal live versions of two classics","This import has two great live songs available on CD nowhere else. The 10-minute ""Incident on 57th Street"" here is the finest version of this great song ever done (available only as a single b-side and all versions I heard of the single had loud popping record noise on it - it's clean here). Also this live wersion of ""For You"" is wonderful. Highly recommended for these two songs. Its a very high priced import, so try to get a good price of it used."
3,You've got to be kidding me,"Simply not worth it for the price, especially now that the Hammersmith '75 show, long a popular bootleg, has been released ('73-'78 was Springsteen's real peak as a live performer) to complement the other multiple Bruce live sets already available. It's a fun listen but I certainly wouldn't pay more than $15 for it, unless you're the sort of Bruce fan whoa absolutely has to have everything, in which case no price will be too high anyway."
5,Collectible for all E-Street Band fans,While there are only 4 songs on this CD it does have two live versions you won't find anywhere else. Great collectible for any E-Street Band fans. Just being able to hear The Big Man again made it worth it for me.
1,Don't waste your money and time on this product,"I saw mixed reviews on this so thought I would give it a try. Big mistake, It quit working after a week. It would no longer rotate the head back and forth. Also I could not get it apart to clean it. It did move water across my aquarium while it worked but that was a short period of time. For freshwater it might work ok but for marine aquariums forget it, it will clog up quickly.My assessment is1. Its way too heavy and it won't stay on the suction cups for long.2. It uses way too much electricity (23 watts) come on, other pumps use 1/3 the juice for the same amount of flow3. Its big and takes up much space4. Its almost impossible to clean so that eventually leads to the powerhead not rotating properly.5. The water flow rate was disappointing as well."
5,A great songstress for all seasons!,A great collection of songs from a favorite artist. I have been a fan of Ms Clark for years. This set tops off all that anyone could want from this extremely fine performer.
2,"Good on science, bad on fiction","The author gets high marks for plausible descriptions of interstellar space travel and human biological modifications, but the story is weighed down by a reactionary feminist agenda. The women characters are all uniformly intelligent, brave, and capable. The men are all stupid, brutish, and craven in different ways. The primary functions of the men seem to be giving massages to the women, getting beat up by women in martial arts competitions and mucking up the mission. They are only redeemed when they submit to the ministrations and authority of the female characters. A good story, but it was tough getting through all the sophomoric psychological characterizations."
3,Sometimes too much,"There's an endorsement from David Brin on the cover of the book, saying something along the lines of ""*this* is science fiction."" And I am the kind of guy who really does enjoy reading about ramscoops and ansibles. But I found Brotherton's descriptions of the ship's propulsion and the binary star system to be a bit much to read through.I like the world he's created, with the abundance of cheap biotech (as will be crammed down your throat in the first three pages), but compared to the richness of the technology, his characters are relatively flat. The story is servicable, but holds no great surprises. A fine book overall, but won't become one of my all-time favorites."
3,new phones shouldnt break,"like many people, i agree that this phone is pretty, small and well. that's about it. yes, you can make calls on it and yes!! it has speakerphone... but that's where the goodness ends. the fingerprints ALL OVER the phone drive me crazy and the fact that my phone and my boyfriends phone (different color, same model) both stopped working when we first bought them (we bought them a month apart and in two different states). and then, miracles of all miracles, my phone started to work 2 weeks later!! who knows what went wrong, but tech support was of no use to me."
1,Another F*CK UP!!!!!!!!,Thanks VZ u messed up AGAIN!!!!!!! They mess up another signature phone with VZ nasty user interface. Everbody hates the MENU style SO PLEASE STOP making every new phone have the same MENU STYLE!!!!!! nobody wants it!!!!!!! When will VZ ever get it RIGHT!!!!!!???????
4,"Great Phone -- Pretty, Compact, and Light","I love this phone. It's pretty, compact, light, and functional. It's Bluetooth compatible and the camera works great. I get a lot of compliments on it for its looks.My only complaint would be that the screen size is small. That's probably not a problem for teenagers, but the over 40 crowd might want something a little easier to see!"
3,low quality,"I've had my phone for about 9 months now, and am going to get a new one. While not a *terrible* phone (i.e., it WORKS), there's a lot of little annoying things about it. 1. text messaging is difficult -- you have to go through about 4-5 screens before you can start entering text, and it's a pain to switch to symbols or caps etc. 2. battery life is short -- after 9 months, my battery can barely hold a charge. 3. the center button on mine started playing a fun trick on me the other day -- where it's literally sliding around when I press it. Turns out the button is only held on by some gooey gel. Thus my getting a new phone. 4. while pretty, the ""metallic"" casing gets dirty FAST.That being said, it's worked fine, I can hear my calls fine, camera is what you would expect for a cell phone...I think I'm just not crazy about how motorola designs their phones. i've had several samsungs and loved them all -- guess what i'll be buying this next time?"
2,you call this a music phone?,"wow. when i first got this phone, i liked the shiny red and the sleek design but wow. i tried getting ringtones from my computer to my phone and the ringtone came fine BUT I COULDN'T SET IT AS MY RINGTONE!! it just saved it as my sound. you do not know how frustrated i am. now i have to buy the ring tone >:( stupid phone.good phone overall but one more problem. it looses batteries VERY quickly and then takes forever to charge fully. it also lags a bit, but i guess all motorola phones are like that.ps. ringtones provided suck"
1,Do NOT BUY a K1m,Do Yourself a favor and NEVER BUY A MOTOROLA K1m! My K1m Has Been the Worst phone I've EVER Owned! The K1m Locks up for no reason without any warning at all. You can't even turn the phone off or on when it's locked up it's just frozen. The mp3 players software is NOT VISTA compatible! I cant even enjoy all the phones feathers because the battery drains too fast! MOTO SUCO
2,better get a smart phone,"Software crashed in 3 monthsVZ changed the phone but kept the battery.Battery needs to be charged twice(!) a day.talk time was 20-40 minutes.Plus my contract was extended because I 'upgraded' my 'equipment'!no games on the phonesyou have to buy everything separately.I think I have to pay to smell my phone.....I have resigned to my fate.Hang on Motorola and VZ, let me bend over and you guys can ride as long as my contract lasts!"
2,Keep trying Motorola,"As a phone, it's OK. Battery life is subpar.As an MP3 player it is a poor performer. If you click options while the MP3 player is running, you get a loud click over the speaker when you scroll through the options.ONLY expandable to 1GB!?! You're kidding Motorola. What's more, of the supposed 1GB, MP3 player only recognized 23 of the more than 60 MP3s I put on the phone. If you want reliability go with LG."
5,"pretty, pretty!!!!","Pros:Very good lookingGreat phoneGreat soundExtremely good lookingI like the feel and it is just the right size for meVery user friendlyLocation of hte memory cardCons:VerizonVerizonVerizonI just love this phone and the features but Verizon cripples it to get up to the last cent from us. Could not transfer my files from my V710 (ringtomes, pictures)The SD1 card works great with it but had to limit the names of songs to 2 words or less.The MP3 has a good sound for being a phone, and the headsets I have (for now) are OK.In all, the phone is great, but I wish I had the guts to break away from Verizon and their pretty phones to get more functionality. Maybe if Cingular improves my next phone will be the Apple phone (or better in 2 years)I still think this phone rocks. However, it has one more feature that it is blocked: Bluetooth connection to your PC. I was able to do that with my old phone but not with this. You can do it IF you buy Verizon's software separately. :("
1,Nice hardware with crippling software,"The krazer works fine, the trouble is the low battery signal. You can't turn it off. No matter what. The problem with that is, the low battery indicator is absolutely ridiculous. The phone has 70% left of its charge and it puts up ""low battery"" and starts beeping. Of course you can always charge it... but then your making the battery worse. If you don't fully discharge the battery the battery is weakened so that it gets worse and worse. Motorola of course knows this. The batteries would actually be fine if the software didn't force you to ruin them."
5,"Funny, Insightful, Great!","Wow, I picked up a copy of this book in paperback near where I live and I loved it. Just LOVED it. I'm lucky it made it up here where I am. I'm a big Duck fan, so I wanted to read more about the history and stuff, but I never knew how well-spoken a man Carl Barks was, and this Donald Ault--he's super! He's super because he takes Barks seriously AS A CREATIVE GENIUS, which he is/was. I see from the back cover Ault's written some pretty deep stuff, he's a professor, but he's really readable. I tend to think most (or lots) or people who are really into the Duck are pretty intelligent folks--those I know are. I don't have a heck of a lot of education, like a master's degree or book writing or whatever, but I read this whole book and I understood it and it's truly enriched my experience--and not just of Donald Duck. I can't recommend it enough.~Rudy C."
5,Back in black no. 1...,"Those dark Brooklyn boys make their return with their newest masterpiece. They come back to us in a time of need with their energy & music quality that is sadly lacking in today's music scene. Peter's sexy, deep vocals & bass are perfect, and the guitar work & keyboard are just superb as always.This cd remenises of Bloody Kisses with songs like ""I don't wanna be me"", ""I like goils"", ""Angry Itch"" give into their faster,punk rock tendencies and ""A dish best served coldly"", ""Life is killing me"", ""How could she?"", ""The dream is dead"" ""Less than zero"" lean towards their familar goth side. All and all this is listenable all the way through, couldn't say there's one song I would skip.For anyone who appreciates good music, why not give this a try. For it certainly won't displease."
3,misconception,"This album is good but in no way ""better"" than World Coming Down which was just as diverse only more subtle with its various sounds (and without the punk). Most people don't get into it and appreciate its understated brilliance because it had a very linear flow. Life is killing me is very streamlined, direct and catchy without the stoner, doom rock pacing; requiring much less patience than its predecessor."
4,Could Use A Transfusion,"OK, first of all, let me say that this CD is better than 99% of the current crop of music. However, it just does not have the same sense of majesty that Bloody Kisses and October Rust had. If you like Type O, you will enjoy it. It's better than World Coming Down, but it kind of lacks the emotion of the first two albums. When I listened to it first, I thought it sounded like the whole band had gone on anti-depressants because all the peaks and valleys and interesting quirks and flourishes were just not there. That being said, go ahead and buy it. Pete and the boys are better, smarter and more original than any other hard rock band operating today."
2,A parody of themselves,"I am a huge Type O Negative fan, own all of their CD's including lead singer and song writer Peter Steeles' former band Carnivore.Music Genius to me is music that's able to penetrate the soul in whatever direction it's aimed. Peter Steele has writen some of the deepest soul penetrating music that I've ever heard. October Rust is a perfect album to hear what Peter Steele is capable of.LIKM is the shallowest album ever by TON, even the earlier works had penetrating anger in them. Bloody Kisses, October Rust and World Coming Down had massive amounts of effective depression, sorrow and death.Possible because of burnout or the end of their record deal, every song on this CD sounds like a shallow copy off an earlier record. I never thought TON would become a parody of themselves but that is what LIKM is all about.The Dream is Dead."
2,Life is Killing Me is missing Type O originality,"One thing that really distinguished Type O from others in their past albums (before LIKM) was the use of that organ, comical / dark lyrics and hard hitting guitar work. Type O truly was a different breed in their first seies of albums. This album (Life is Killing Me) is more mainstream than what I would have liked to hear. The masterful organ work Type O used to employ (""Unsuccessfully Coping"", ""Chrisitan Woman"", ""Love You To Death"", ""Be My Druidess"" etc etc...) is all but gone. The dark / comical lyrics have disappeared. True, Kenny Hickey does a lot more guitar than in prior albums but now they sound just like another metal / punk band out there.The distinguishing characteristics which once separated Type O from the pack are not there in Life Is Killing Me. Every song sounds strikingly similar which is something this band never did. I'm disappointed to say the least."
5,Life is lovely...,"This is one of those rare albums that you leave the repeat button on. Songs like I don't wanna be me & I like goils give the album that speed metal feel like the early ones, but this album has It's share dark slow ballades as well such as Iydkmigthtky (gimme that) or Anesthesia. It Is like depression on zoloft. I listen to all kinds of music and it is becsuse albums like this that Type O Negative is my favorite band. If your a fan you will love it, if your not you will love it anyway."
4,Best since Bloody Kisses,I really did not know what to expect from this CD. After their past two cd's I didn't have the highest hopes. I was very surprised at how good this Cd. I would say it is the second best Cd that Type O has put out. Very good recovery effort after their last (and my least favorite Type O) CD.
3,GOOD PARTY RECORD-HOWEVER...,"What can one say about Type O with all the reviews contained herein?I am not a Type O ""Groupee"", therefore I buy & review the material for what it is.Seems like once a band creates a following, certain fans become somewhat ""positive biased"" to whatever material the band produces. Even if the material is vague, un-artistic or manufactured.GOOD PARTY ALBUM-HOWEVER...Good party album, can become ""dry"" at times. None of the songs really ""jump out at you"" except ""I Don't Wanna Be Me"" might show some intellegent songwriting.INDUSTRIAL-GOTH?Definitely NOT as hardcore industrial & gothic as some of these previous reviews may lead you to think. May be more of a ""manufactured rock"" album. A mild & refined ""commercial"" forte.Nonetheless, still a good one to toss into the changer.Amazon's the one with the nice price!!!"
1,I was expecting much better..,"I am a fan of heavy music and after hearing many songs from Type O Negative I decided to get this CD. I had heard the song ""I Don't Wanna Be Me"" and ""Angry Itch"", and figured the rest of the album would be somewhat like that or good. However, once I listened to the CD, I found it all sounded the same, meshed to together, and in the end was a total waste of time and money. Almost ALL of the songs drag on with no meaning and sound boring. Good long songs and softer songs have a purpose, this is boring and long for NO purpose, it never amounts to anything. I can't name a particularly bad song because really I can't remember one from another nor do I want to. It is all just dragging and very boring. Peter Steele needs to write better lyrics, too, as I find all these cliche and old. If you are looking for good metal that you won't find on radio, look to KILLSWITCH ENGAGE, CHIMAIRA, and other good artists. This is just trash..."
5,Life is Killing Me,"Brilliant new album, the likes of which we haven't ever seen out of this fantastic band. The songs are all unique, and most are of a ""new"" style, but they all have a distinctly hard and Type O sound. There are riffs and tones that point to past albums--this album is beautiful. Favorites include: ""Nettie"", ""Anesthesia"", ""Less Than Zero (<0)"", and ""A Dish Best Served Coldly"", as well as the instrumental ""Drunk In Paris"". I highly recommend this cd..."
5,Original - cut & dry,"Nevermind the first reviewer. He apparently held some expectations that Hissanol would sound like NMN. It's not.This album is intense, dreamy, and full of life. The best part is that it was a transatlantic collaboration between friends overseas. I think its definately one of a kind and worth the buy. It's rather old now, but was played many many times in it's day.It's a keeper."
1,It is rugged. Functions intermittently; practically useless,"Plus notes - It is well constructed and installation went fast.Then I plugged in brand new batteries and followed the programming steps.It took hours of repeated tries, removing the batteries overnight, and trying different brand of fresh from the package batteries.Finally it worked, so I called my wife over to show her how to unlock and lock our garage door, and it would not work.Again I pulled out the batteries and left it overnight. The next afternoon I plugged the batteries in, and it worked in both directions - lock and unlock. My wife tried it and it did work. Later that day, I wanted to lock the door, and it wouldn't work.Again remove batteries over night. Next day OK for one operation, then it wouldn't work.The final straw is the business I purchased it from thru Amazon will not return phone calls nor emails.Do NOT buy one."
1,Cannot recommend,Worked fine for about a year then the keypad failed. seems to be a very consistent problem (see several other reviews)
1,Sucks Period,Guess I'm a little luckier than most as my unit hasn't completely died on me yet. I did not buy it on Amazon and it's going on 3 years. The electronic unlock action is intermittent. I need to enter my code 2 or 3 times and / or cycling the lock function because the bolt always sticks on the return. This is not a battery issue and a major pain unlocking at night.
2,Numbers rub off,The numbers on the external keypad have rubbed off after 2 years. Have to renumber with a Sharpie every few months. Other than that it works fine. Batteries last about 9 months. Bolt retraction slows down when it's time to change.
1,Disappointed,"I liked the lock while it worked, BUTEach time the batteries wear out, my Powerbolt 1000 stops working (Yes, I mean with new batteries installed)I am at my 2nd battery change. Each time the batteries have lasted a little over a year. After the 1st battery change, the lock did not work despite multiple attempts / battery changes / etc so I left it alone for 2 - 3 weeks, then came back to it - and it worked.Now: I made 2nd battery change a couple weeks ago, tested them, etc. Still not working.I emailed Kwikset support. They answered with a 800 number saying I should buy a new board. Fat chance. I'll purchase a different brand.Lowell"
1,$100 ONE YEAR LOCK,Stopped working in less than a year. Would never buy this or any product from Kwikset again!!!
5,Perfect,this was the second one that I have purchased. the product functions just as it should. I tried a model from a different manufacturer and was totally unsatisfied.
2,This idems didn't work for me,The mechanism didn't exactly match the one I was replacing... the item did not fit correctly- I couldn't tight the screws completely because the lock would bind up
1,stops working too soon,Have had this unit a little over a year and now it isn't working. Now I have to find the same unit so I don't have to drill new holes in my door.
2,"keypad, no good","I bought three, and three failed. One failed after about two months. The second took six months to fail. The third lock, which was installed on an interior door of a residence, took nearly a year to fail. It seems to be the keypad that fails in these. Mine started beeping all by itself at night and then failed to beep at all when trying to use."
4,"Does what it should do. Nothing more, nothing less...","I have this deadbolt at my house. I like to leave and go out for a walk on the beach without having to carry a key around. I punch in my code, and when I get home, it unlocks! I have yet to be locked out. When I leave, I just hit the middle button, and the deadbolt engages and locks the door.Just in case - I hid a key on my property, but I have not used in in the past two years. The batteries (4 AAs) last about 9 months to a year, but I change them every six months. You can actually hear when the power is diminished.All in, great product, and if you like to leave without keys, this is for you!"
1,This electronic deadbolt is junk!,"We installed our Kwikset smartcode electronic deadbolt in August 2008. The electronics failed by December 2009 and the electronic warranty expires after 1 year. We contacted Kwikset's warranty department and they informed us that for $45, they would be happy to send us a new electronic unit, with no additional warranty that we could install ourselves! I will never buy their products again, save your money!"
2,Doesn't stand up to heavy rain,"Installed on the outside garage door easily. Within a month, after a thunderstorm, 2 buttons quit working. So, got a new one and this time caulked the outside face plate. Within 2 months, heavy rain soaked and disabled all the buttons. Don't think this device is designed for areas like FL where heavy thunderstorms are routinely seen. Perhaps should have a slide cover to protect buttons."
1,This is the second Kwikset Powerbolt to malfunction in two years!,"I have purchased and installed two of these locks over a two year period. Both started to malfunction within a year. The motor whines but the bolt only moves halfway in or out of the lock. I tried taking the cover off and lubing everything with silicone spray which worked for about two or three weeks.I really liked the look of this lock so I purchased a 2nd one to replace the first one after I was tired of performing ""maintenance"" on it so often. The 2nd lock worked for a while then started doing the same thing.After reading other reviews it appears this lock has a fundamental mechanical defect that is not conducive to long term residential use. My next lock with be a brand other than Kwikset. I have no patience for inferior, sub-standard products."
2,Just OK while it lasted--Quirky. But Dreaded Beeping after 2 years,"I would NOT recommend this product. Worked just OK (quirky--while it did work) but after just over 2 years, the continuous beeping started. Going to Schlage."
4,It's worked for me for over 3 years,"I guess each person has their own experience, but this lock has been wonderful and ""no"" I don't work for Kwikset. I can change the code as needed. It has not failed on me yet. The only reason I would change it is due to the fact that the numbers are starting to fade. So I know in a couple of years, this may not be as great. Nonetheless, I've had a great experience with this product."
2,Poor product. Buy the Schlage,"I bought the powerbolt about 1-1/2 years ago. Worked good but pretty noisy and you can tell it's not nearly as well built as the Schlage. It was easy to install and worked until two weeks ago. It started beeping continuously. I installed new batteries but didn't help so I called tech support and they told me it was the keypad. I talked them into replacing it for the cost of freight and have been waiting over a week for the part to arrive. Not happy. When you look at the price of the Powerbolt compared to the Schlage, you'll save about $30.00 but regret it later. Reliability is the issue. Buy the Schlage!"
2,"Good, cheap, but flimsy","Good, cheap manuscript paper. Very bright. Very thin. Very frustrating (because it sags-folds over onto itself in the slightest breeze). But if you want inexpensive and utilitarian scratch paper, this is it."
3,"Good, but ...","The paper quality and thickness makes this product good, but a suggestion for an improvement is that the chemical make up of the paper surface should be such that normal No 2 lead pencil could be used and a normal rubber erasurer does not leave a big red mark after a correction."
1,Almost as crappy as Passantino paper,"This paper is ultra lightweight, but not as thin as its equivalent in Passantino brand. Uncoated. Very bright white.If you want real manuscript paper that takes both pencil and ink wonderfully and is good and sturdy, get Fischer's King Brand--but it's only available in 10-stave.The best, heavy, coated, ivory 12-stave folded manuscript paper was unfortunately discontinued by Fischer a few years ago."
3,HJC Helmet Size Recommendation Incorrect,"These helmets seem to run big, order a size down. After measuring my head exactly per the HJC recommendation I ordered the appropriate size, 24"" head diameter = Extra Large. But after wearing the helmet a bit I found it was a little too big and moved around with wind direction changes at highway speeds, and I also had a lot of wind coming in around the visor. Unfortunately by the time I realized this helmet was too big I had already thrown the packaging away so I was unable to return it. I have another helmet which is a regular size Large and it fits properly. My new helmet is now for sale after just a few uses."
5,My favorite helmet,"This is currently, my favorite helmet. I like the fact that it doesn't completely cover my face like a full helmet. It fit true to form."
1,Piece of Crap,"This memory card is great for holding memory, but the format feature just doesn't seem to exist. That means that a corrupt file would definitely be dead, and so will your card. It has already screwed up on my gamecube, and don't get it messed up with yours."
4,Nice Product,Works great. I'm using it to control 4 speaker pairs with Volume Controls. It also has a button to protect your receiver if you plan to run more than 1 speaker pair at a time
1,A complete disappointment and waste of money.,"My complete disappointment in this product actually inspired me to write my first amazon review. The top half of the sun falls off if a cricket chirps too loudly and the ""planetarium"" part is nothing but a bunch of big blurry dots with illegible writing unless you hold it sideways 2 inches from the wall. Your child will get nothing from this product that they couldn't get from a cheap plastic mobile. Save your money."
2,Not too much milage out of this one,"My son liked this toy for a week or two, but now he is bored with it. It was good to show him a 3D model of the solar system, but I agree that it's wrong to have the planets all travelling at the same rate of speed. Since he wanted the toy to ""do"" something, he promptly took it apart. We are now missing Uranus! It does make a good decoration for his room, though, even though we are missing a planet. Also, the planetarium feature that is supposed to show the constellations on the ceiling was not too effective."
3,The physics profs were too hard on this item,"While this toy does not demonstrate the actual relative speeds of the planets around the Sun (planets closer to the Sun move faster), you shouldn't expect it to for 40 bucks. That kind of authenticity would cost a lot more. The educational value of this toy is still sound and anything that increases the awareness of the worlds outside our own for our kids is of value."
4,Nice toy for younger kids.,I bought this even after reading the reviews and my 5 year old son LOVES IT! Yea sure they all orbit at the same speed. For a 5 year old that likes planets this is great. He has not stopped playing with it since he opened it. He says it the best Christmas gift he got.
2,Don't!,"I'm NOT a physics professor, but I guess my expectations were much higher than some of the other reviewers. [$$$]is too much money for this toy. If your purpose is to demonstrate to your child the workings of our Solar System, then a reasonably true movement of the planets around our Sun IS important. You won't get that with this toy. If all you're after is to provide your child with a fun model that demonstrates the order of the planets this model does that. I also wasn't impressed with the overhead constellation map."
2,Not Accurate...,"I was just looking at this in hopes of getting a realistic view of current planet alignments... I realize they can't be perfect, but the whole idea I had was to see when things like planetary alignments occured, or what planets are relaively (relatively being the key work) close to earth...I essentially wanted to be able to power it up, set the current alignment, then let it sit running indeffinately... This does not do what I'm looking for..."
4,How to get to heaven without guilt,"This is trully a remarkable book. While reading this book everything within me wanted to give the author lectures and quote verse and authority to him. But he won me over to feel that one should give substantial weight to his position in balancing one's own position. While I was not bowled over by the genius and brilliance of a Merton, or seduced by Mertons gift with language, I felt that the Holy spirit might just have offered a little input to this work, as I am certain he did with much of Merton's work as well, but a true humility seems to shine through all the while presenting something that seems to shake our roots, though often those roots are little more than the church's equivalent of old wifes tales."
4,Former Philly cop delves deep into the the Scarfo mafia.,"Frank Friel shows his mettle in this extensively detailed book about his involvement in breaking up the Nicky Scarfo mob in Philadelphia. Friel was the cop end of a special task force where the FBI and local police cooperated in breaking up the Scarfo syndicate.Friel's descriptions are extensive with interviews with mafia players and extensive details on the construction of Scarfo's mafia hierarchy and the conviction of Philly mafia wiseguys.At times Friel comes off as too saintly but manages to avoid boring the reader with too much self promotion. Instead, his nuts-and-bolts information on the Philly mob is hard hitting and to the point. He knows all the players well and by the end of the book so will the reader.Unlike other mafia books where mobsters sound romantic and rebellious, Friel shows the brutality and petty nature of the real deal.A must-read for anyone beginning to learn about the Philly mob scene."
5,Best canner on the market.,Excellently machined and designed. This is the best canner I have ever owned don't waist your money on any other canner.
5,Good stuff...,"I bought this as my first pressure cooker/canner and after doing some empty test runs(to test stove and make sure everything was sealed) the first batches I did was canned beef, raw and hot packed. Over the last 6months I've eaten one whole batch and it tastes as good as beef from a slow cooker. In-fact I have to restrain myself from eating too much, it's just too easy to have a quick good beef meal. 1 pint =~ 1lb of beef. at $199.99 it was best canner I could find. I only wish it was made of stainless steel, as I don't like the idea of cooking with aluminum pots(canning is ok since food is in glass).I might add a lot of pot manufacturers have switched to aluminum bases away from copper; they claim it is superior heat distribution but it is not, only cheaper; Look it up, copper has better conductivity and higher melting point."
5,Pressure Canner,"Excellent canner, easy to use, great size, strong looking and it will obviously last forever.. I agree that you wouldn't want to use it on a smooth top stove.. the weight of the canner is pretty significant... we use it outside on the porch, on a propane burner.. absolutely stupid instruction manual though... you learned things on page 17 that you needed to know on page 2.. and it tells you things to NEVER EVER can, but two pages later tells you how to can them... (such as beans) but if you disregard the goofy manual and use other amazing canning books such as ""Putting food by"" by Janet Greene, you will love it."
5,Amazing tool for my kitchen!,"I had a Presto canner before I bought this one, and I think both canners are great values for the money. The Presto did a great job, but wasn't anywhere nearly as solidly built as the All American 921. This canner is amazing. It's built like a WWII battleship. It also made less noise during canning than the Presto.I think I'm going to buy a smaller one as well to pressure cook meals in. Pressure cooked roast is amazing, and this one is too big for convenience in cooking meals."
5,The canner's friend,"This is my site but my wife and I are writing this.On my old one I broke the glass face on the PSI gauge, and it was a replaceable gasket type which I wanted to get away from. This one works great. It is a little heavy and I'm not very mechanical minded but my husband helped me get initiated. Now I wouldn't have any other cooker. An excellent investment."
5,Excellent!,"I've used my pressure canner several times this first season and it works beautifully. The major selling point, aside from the quantity of other high reviews, was that it is made in the USA. I really wanted a durable product made in the USA and that is exactly what I got. I had put off purchasing a pressure canner because I had heard so many scare stories about them blowing up if you don't use it right and after using it several times, I can honestly say that as long as safety and directions are followed, theres nothing to be afraid of with this product. I highly recommend purchasing this product."
5,Excellent service,"I ordered the All American canner hoping that it would arrive in time for a class I was teaching. The canner arrived in just a few days, plenty of time to spare for the class. I recommended Amazon and the great service I received to each of the students. This is the best pressure canner on the market, hands down."
4,All American Pressure cooker/canner,"Very well made, kind of heavy to move but I would rather have that than it be flimsy. Directions were easy to read. I was kind of worried having never used one before but it went a lot better than I thought."
5,Good as expected,All American lived up to it's reputation. No rubber seal and works everytime i used it.No presto- Buy All American
5,The reviews of this item are true!,"This pressure canner is the best I have ever used! If you want a canner that works great and will last, this is it!"
5,"Awesome, five star service.",The item arrived very quickly and was exactly as described. Very excited about using it this weekend. Thanks so much.
5,the only one to ever buy,"I purchased the smaller unit for myself. A word of caution, if you have a range hood the larger model may not clear it. All pressure cookers say not to cook on a ceramic or glass top...well, I've used mine for years on my electric glass top with no problems...I am careful not to jossle it around when full but that's the only precaution I take. With no gaskets, this cooker will last a lifetime. It's quite heavy but that's what makes it so solid a cooker. If you like to can, this is the only pressure cooker you should buy. Highly recommended"
4,Won't know until I actually use it next summer....,"You know, I think I'm going to like it just fine. It's made here in the US and it appears to be very sturdy. I won't actually use it until next summer so will have a better idea then. Amazon kept pushing me for a review, so I thought I'd get it out of the way."
5,if only everything was made this well!,"Built like a bank vault and made to last several liftimes.looks like a throw back to the 50'S when ""Made in America"" was all you had to see to know you were buying a quality product that was more than worth the money and would be a purchase that you only had to make once.so...worth the money? dont even hesitate and even consider a ""cheap"" one at about half the price.buy this and know right out the box that it is going to be a family hierloom for generations to come even with heavy use.came on-time no problems or hassle. works great. read the book."
5,One of the best canners,I have another one of these pressure canners but much bigger. They are the easiest to use and be safe with. It is worth the extra dollars to get something that works well.
4,monster canner,this is my first pressure canner so i do not have much to compare to. i am very happy with its construction and thorough instructions
1,I am mad!!,"My mother in law has had the 315 canner for many years and it still works well. We bought the 921 and have had nothing but grief! The first one we ordered refused to seal so they replaced it on warranty. The second one seals maybe 1 out of 10 tries!! The Foundery is offering to replace again with the smaller model(?) so I guess we will try our luck with that one, but the 921? Never!!"
5,Excellent Pressure Canner,We have a massive garden at the cottage and this is the perfect pressure canner to can all of our garden goodies!
5,works great,"Hay, I can food alot and this canner is great for that. It is such a joy to use I started cooking food in it. I can make ribs that are fall off the bone in 15min! The only thing that I have found that you should know is the seal needs some lube and needs to be clean or it will leak. No big deal! Get the blue ball book and enjoy cooking and canning with a great pot. Lastly, it will hold only 18 pint jars, I think I read it will hold 19? It may, but I don't see how? Maybe if you smashed the last one and put it in pices."
4,All American 21 1/2 qt. pressure canner,"This is a great canner. Takes a little getting used too and occasionally I have a problem turning the lid to take it off after canning. But overall, it's really good! Everything I have canned has sealed and I would recommend this canner if you are looking for one."
5,Best canner made also the best bang for your buck,"This thing is bullet proof!!! everything about it will last!!!!I use it over a turky frier at 175,000 BTU and it dose great, unlike the cheap crap you find other places(Presto)If you look at what the 21 1/2 qt holds for jars, it the best bang for your buckGood american made stuff is hard to find anymore but this is on the list!!!!!!"
1,this cracked the third time I used it,there is a crack on this pressure cooker. I had used it three times. Do I dare use it or not
5,Best Pessure Cooker Brand EVER!,"I bought this pressure canner/cooker 10 years ago at a garage sale. Its still going strong! You will never need to buy another pressure cooker. This brand is made well with traditional good ole fashioned quality.It not only cans, but it sterilizes as well!"
5,Excellent Quality - Worth the extra money,"My husband and I bought this pressure canner about a year ago, and it is very heavy duty and very good quality. We have used this a lot this year for canning, and its the best I've seen. I'm actually thinking of buying a second canner in a bigger size so I can do 14 quarts at a time. I will definitely buy the All American again!"
4,Just what i wanted,"I shopped for quite a while for a pressure canner to take to the beach this fall to can fresh-from-the-boat albacore. The friend that usually comes and brings one wasn't coming this year. I bought a Presto brand one from a local store but the directions said it could not be used on an open flame (!)and it was made in China, so it went back to the store. This was the best price I could find for this product. It arrived quickly and we took it to the beach and canned 90 jars of tuna. It performed perfectly, kept a steady pressure for the full 90 minutes that each batch required. I also like that it was made in the USA and has no rubber seal that would need to be replaced probably each year. It is just kinda expensive (over 3 times more than the Presto)for something that is only used a few times a year. I am happy that I bought it."
5,Excellent canner,"Purchased this for use as a canner, not a cooker. It's a little heavy as a cooker. Instructions were straight forward and easy to follow. It was quick to set up and use. I like the idea that there is no gasket to fail, just the steel to steel seal which performs well. I have used it for both pressure and water-bath canning and am very satisfied. It's a perfect size for the number of quarts and pints in my favorite recipes so saves time."
4,Samsung 800-Watt 5.1 Channel Home Theater System,"Pretty cool system. Remote functionality could be tweaked abit with Samsung TV remote, and cable TV. When you place a DVD or CD, and open system it always switches to DVD or CD mode. This is a pain when your watching a play-off game. Over all I'm pretty satisfied."
2,Not what I expect from Samsung,"Samsung has become the global leader in consumer electronics, home A/V and appliance markets. But I guess this is not one of their better products. The styling is fine, but the sound quality is not quite there (very shallow), and the DVD player can get very picky on the DVD it wants to play.Overall not the best product I got from Samsung. I do recommend their LCD/LED TVs. Great Colors and contrast."
2,A disappointment,"I'm a Caldrea fan. I had initially thought that it would be a luxurious choice, but with all the other Caldrea products I've used, I've found that they were so much more effective and long-lasting than their grocery store counterparts that they weren't extravagances at all.So I was glad to see these. I like the convenience of surface wipes, but don't like to use disposables for environmental reasons. This seemed like a good compromise.Unfortunately, they aren't. Where I can use one grocery store brand surface wipe to clean all my kitchen counters, these disintegrated so quickly that it took three to do my counters.The scent is not reminiscent of sweet peas, and in fact I found it unpleasant. This was a big surprise; normally, Caldrea products smell so good that they make the experience of cleaning downright enjoyable.I'll go back to Caldrea's all-purpose cleaner and sponges."
2,I love Stockard Channing but her series were subpar,"I fell in love with Stockard Channing in her tv movie where she got revenge on all the football heroes and cheerleaders on her college campus and from her work in ""Grease."" I was so excited in 1979 when her first series, ""Stockard Channing in Just Friends"" premiered. It was not good. A year later her re-tooled series then called ""The Stockard Channing Show"" returned. It was a definite improvement, and it included the late great Ron Silver. All in all Stockard should have associated herself with a better production team. I still love Stockard Channing."
4,Great resource for 4x4 routes in Colorado,We had never been 4 wheeling in Colorado and found this resource to be very helpful. We had a great time.
4,20 Favorites from Scottish 30-60 Various Artists,"This CD has some good stuff on it, however, the quality of some tracks is at best poor. For those of you who remember The White Heather Club, Andy Stewart and The Jimmy Shand Band will put up with the quality because of the memories."
1,Does not work,"I bought two of the whistles, one for each of my children, thinking they would love them. They are terrible! Only an adult has the strength to blow into them hard enough to make the train whistle sound. What a waste of money."
3,4 oz bottles,CAREFUL - NOTE that the cleaning solution and the dye are both just 4 ozs each. IT says that the packagge weight is 12 oz...not sure how...but the bottles are only 4 oz each. CAREFUL if you are expecting each bottle to be more.
1,SHOE POLISH,PRODUCT IS SHOE POLISH WITH DIFFRENT LABLE-PEELS OFF WHEN IN SUN-DIFFICULT TO APPLY-I WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN-SAVE YOUR MONEY
1,NOT for the Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo WJ,This product won't work for the dark gray bumpers and door guards of the Grand Cherokee Laredo WJ (99-03). I followed perfectly all the instructions and this ruined my Grand Cherokee's rear bumper. Works great ONLY on Black trims.
3,better ending,It W's a great series but it seems clear that the writers were not prepared for season cancellation. It left too many open questions.
3,Difficult assembly,"I didn't realize when I was buying this shed, that it has no assembled walls, just the long narrow boards from which the walls get assembled. Takes forever, had to hire someone for a full day to do the job."
4,Great shed but time consuming to put together,"After reading several negative reviews on this product decided to buy the shed and provide extra bracing if the shed wasn't very sturdy. Since I live in southern Arizona I thought going metal would be best since the sun seems to destroy everything else. Overall I am really pleased with the shed. It is a lot nicer than other reviews made it out to be. The installation process is very time consuming, took about 6 hours with two people. There were a lot of screws, but once put together the shed was very nice. Very happy with the product and would buy again. Extra things I did I put a coat of paint on the shed to match my house and used silicon to seal the shed better from bugs and dust. I also built a wood foundation since the shed would be setting on a slope to set the shed on. I also plan to build some shelves in it for storage."
5,Excellent all-over workout,"This tape is excellent. I really appreciate the instructor's frequent tips and reminders about alignment to help prevent injury. She's obviously very experienced and knows her stuff. The workout itself is great--covers the whole body, and you'll feel toned and tightened all over."
5,A great book from a young neighbor,"Zippy was a wonderful little girl. She grew up in an area familiar to me and a couple of generations of my family. I can vouch for her description of life there --the streets, the cemetery where my grave plot is. Whatever we may think of Zippy's family and some incidents that took place daily, I sensed that Zippy was always loved, and she loved back. It is comforting to know that a loving family can produce a successful child--one who loves--in spite of whatever may befall that family. Long live the Zippys of this world, and their small hometowns. It is a funny, heart- touching book. Please, Haven, write us another!"
4,"Very good, but be forewarned...","This was a very good book, funny, poignant, and worth the time. Zippy was quite the character; and the author paints her thought processes as a young tomboy with accuracy and whimsy. But I wish I had been forewarned: there are a lot of small dead animals involved in her growing up in rural Indiana. Most of those stories are in the first part of the book. I actually got to the point where I said if there is one more sad/abused animal story, I'm going to stop reading. Luckily, I didn't have to stop and ended up enjoying the book a great deal. I would recommend it with reservations."
2,Audio CD: Lake Woebegone without the wit,"I guess I was thinking this would be something along the lines of Garrison Keillor, but I found there to be no wit to this audio cd at all. If you like listening to boring, wholesome stories about people sewing clothes, getting up early to go to Church, and the like, you will love this book. Otherwise, just go do that yourself and save yourself the money.The female voiceover is okay, fitting for telling stories about a small town. Sounds like a relatively young woman (under 40) who speaks without any major intonations, accents, or defects. At times the CD irritates me, but I think it's more the content."
5,Never laughed so much!,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend. She suggested that I keep a tally of the number of times I laughed outloud. I should have done it...I know it would have filled a sheet of paper. I didn't keep a tally, however, because I was too busy reading...and re-reading to my husband, because he wanted to know why I was laughing so hard.Kimmel is an amazing writer! She skillfully describes the real world through the unassuming eyes of a child."
4,quirky fun memoir of growing up in town of 300 people,"Zippy is the nickname of a girl who grows up in a very small town in the Midwest, and it's as if she grows up in a different historical era. The book is light, and there are touching scenes, and it ends on a moving note. I don't often read memoirs of young girls growing up, but I was drawn to the book, and I can heartily recommend it as a sweet diversion from whatever your main diet is. Not that there's anything wrong with heavy confession, but it's nice, too, to have a more delicate repast upon occasion."
5,A GIRL NAMED ZIPPY-GROWING UP SMALL IN INDIANA,"LOVED THIS BOOK! SAW MANY PARALLELS OF MY OWN LIFE ""GROWING UP SMALL IN SMALL TOWNS"". HONEST, UPLIFTING AND ENTERTAINING! SOUR GRAPES TO CINDY SUMMERS OF INDIANA. I THOUGHT THE BOOK FLOWED VERY WELL AND LOOK FORWARD TO A SEQUEL."
5,Heartwarming and wonderful,"I first heard about this book when listening to a review on NPR, and immediately picked it up from the library. I was finishing up law school exams, and wanted to save it as a treat for when they were over. But I made the mistake of picking up the book that same day and leafing through it - and was immediately hooked. My studying was put on hold until I finished reading it. And even then, I rushed to order a copy so that I could have my own.This book has everything - wonderful characterizations of both people and animals, rich and hilarious imagery, and a tone of nostalgia throughout that leaves you with a wonderful sigh at the end. When I finished this book, I wanted to know Zippy's family and the residents of the town (except maybe Edythe), I wanted to live in Mooreland and ride my bike with streamers flying out of the handles, and most important, I wanted to be best friends with Zippy."
5,A great memoir...,"I thought this was an adorable book. Very funny. Haven Kimmel describes her childhood beautifully. Zippy is such an energetic little thing, it was nice reading about a childhood that was enjoyed (I just finished Running With Scissors not to long ago...wow).Some of the animal scenes wern't the most pleasant to read about, but then again life isn't perfect, and animals do meet unfortunate ends. If you can't handle it, don't read it. I highly recommend this book, it really was a great read, and I'm looking forward to her newest novel, Something Rising."
4,Terrific peek into small town life,"Although the author grew up in Indiana, her stories could have been set in almost any small town in America.We all have/had a local drug store with terrific fountain drinks. We all had to learn not to be too attached to the farm animals. Every small town in America has an 'evil' woman who stews puppies for dinner. We all had that one horrible teacher who bedeviled us in elementary school. And, we all had siblings who drove us nuts.What sets this book apart is the sharp, crisp writing of its talented author. I laughed out loud when she described how her sister had told her she was adopted. I laughed even harder when her mother confirmed the sister's allegations with an even more elaborate tale of gypsies and a green velvet bag for trade!This is not Proust, but it is a glimpse into a life/time that we probably will never see again....innocence and a sense of community.Enjoy!"
2,Far fetched...,"I thought that this was supposed to be a true story(I may be wrong) but if it is supposed to be true it is rather far fetched. One example is that Kimmel tells how her dog would pick her up by her diaper and put her back it the yard. Sure,maybe in a Disney story! And how she didn't say a single word until she was three and then she said an entire precocious sentence where she strikes a deal with her father. I don't know what it was but something just turned me off to this book. I must be honest, I never even finished it because I was so unimpressed. I grew up in a very small midwest town similar to Mooreland and I just don't feel that her story rings true. I don't know what else to say aside from read the first couple of pages before buying the book (especially in hard cover)and see what you think. If you decide to purchase this book based on the other reviews I hope that you will find pleasure in this book (unlike myself) and prove my review wrong."
3,Animal Lovers Beware,"In the first 75 pages of this warm and fuzzy book, the following happens (and not much else): a piglet dies, a dog dies of worms, a hen and rooster are dragged off by dogs, the dogs get shot, a cat is stolen and starved in a basement, oh, and a rabbit has its ears stapled to a fence and its head chopped off. One would expect plenty of death on a farm but there's no farm in this story. Just a backyard."
1,Shame,"I did not find this book funny at all. In fact, it was more disturbing that so many people found humor in the way she told her stories. I found it upsetting that the author just casually spoke of situations that are rather violent, like her friend flinging the baby pig to her vicious dog and smiling at the sight of it flying through the air or her brother smacking her sister for being what is essentially a teenager. I was a child of a drunk father and a depressed mother, but I never used someone else's misfortunes as an excuse to laugh and see the better side of life. In all honesty, I am disgusted by this author and by the people who gave her great reviews. It made me more sad than happy. Shame on you, Zippy, for making small town folks sound like animals."
3,Zipped right through it!,"It was a required read for our book club. Can't say I would have picked it on my own. Felt like reading someone's journal although I liked the style of writing, you could visualize every event. It was a nice finish to our reading season, we take the summer off. I would recommend it to certain individuals but not everyone."
2,A Girl Named zippy: Eng. Homework for West Hills College,"Hello my name is Gus and i thought the book was alright. Zippy was not the best book ive had read. Its funny in certain ways, it could make you laugh believe me but, sometimes her plot did not make sense to me. I could question about what she went though her life and maybe relay about how she lived in a small town like i do. But everyone in that town is very different in that book."
3,Not as Good as I thought..,"I guess I considered a memoir to be more factual. Some of her stories/conversations she couldn't possibly remember at a younger age. I have a 6 yr daughter and consider it important to try and keep up with the mind of a young girl. She did seem very self-centered and bratty. I suppose these can be issues for most girls growing up. I got kind of turned off on her as the book went on. I imagined she was sort of a bully. I guess I probably wouldn't have liked her much, like she said most adults didn't. There were many parts of the book, though, that were funny and thought-provoking."
3,Ummmm....No,"Despite its lack of plot and structure, this book wasn't all that bad. It had some fairly interesting parts along with some quite funny parts. I disliked the lack of plot in the book and the way it seemed to just describe every little detail it could. It seemed as if she was just trying to make the book longer. The begging was extremely boring with few parts that kept my interest, but towards the end it seemed to pick up and involve more exciting incidents. Despite the poor writing structure (in my opinion), the writing was extremely good and very descriptive (too descriptive at some times as I said before). I also disliked the fact that it would change subject between every few paragraphs, telling a different story each time, only to come back to the original story, sometimes causing confusion.Overall, the book was bad, but at its good points, they were pretty damn good."
1,Disorganized memoirs,"I found this book very disjointed and unconnected. It is hard to determine how old Zippy is in any given chapter. Chapters do not flow. There are no transitions. I also thought the author told tales that are probably embarrassing to the families involved. These are real people and some she considered her best friends. I am glad I was not a friend of Haven (Betsy) Kimmel in Mooreland, In."
1,"The ""Me"" Generation - Zippy","Well written but it is hardly deep or cerebral. Read about someone who is very taken with herself and wanted to write a book. So is this what our new generation of writers is about? The world is full of miraculous wonders, great pain and suffering, revolutionary ideas that people die for, and Zippy got a ""piano"" for Christmas. My copy is for sale."
2,Who's the writer in the family?,"I started A Girl Named Zippy prejudiced in its favor, based on reviews I'd read, and at first I wasn't disappointed. In fact, my initial reaction was so favorable that it took me a while to admit to myself how disenchanted I later became. After a while, the narrator stops seeming charmily witty and comes across, instead, as nasty. ""I thought she just got disgusting,"" my 19-year-old daughter said forthrightly. (More discerning than I, she simply stopped reading a third of the way through.) What appears to be a complete lack of any spiritual dimension is, I think, what does Kimmel in; it's one thing to reject the specific religious tradition of one's family, but a childish brat with no larger frame of reference just isn't appealing. It occured to me later that in the first pages of her book, Kimmel relies heavily on quoting from entries made in her baby book by her mother; maybe the mother is the one whose memoir I'd really like to read."
5,!!! Grate Book !!!,"This is one of the few good books that I have read. I recomed this book to anyone who has reading as a hobby, because every time you read it its like having a small movie in your head. Not to mantion it tells about Zippy adventures while growing up in a small town."
1,to be avoided ?,"anyone wondering about this book would surely be warned to avoid it by the two official reviews chosen by amazon -picking four lines at random i quote, thus:'The truths of childhood are rendered in lush yet simple prose''Over and over, we encounter pearls of third-grade wisdom revealed in a child's assured voice''The startling baby photograph on the cover should catch browsers' eyes''multitudes of animals, including a chicken she loved and treated like a baby'i rest my case!"
5,A Great Buy,"This is a laugh out loud book. Told from a childs perspective. If you can remember back that far, you will LOVE this book. Beautifully written."
4,"Sweet, funny, uplifting","This was the first book in the memoir genre that I have read, and I really enjoyed it. Zippy is told from the author's childhood voice, is full of humor, and takes you back to when you were a kid having the same thoughts. I'm amazed that someone could remember so much about their childhood and tell the story in such a fun way. It's a quick, easy read and will leave you feeling uplifted! I also recommend it's sequel - She Got Up Off The Couch..."
5,Zippy brings Zip into a childhood memoir!,"Great book! Although Zippy's childhood is far from perfect and has dysfunction written all over it, her child's perspective is funny and refreshing. Laugh out loud at small town drama though the eyes of a child."
3,A Girl Named Zippy,Cute and thoughtful. An easy read that makes you remember how things were different way back when.
5,"Unique, Touching & Hilarious","The true genius of this book is the combination of honor, honesty and humor. Kimmel shares her memories with an unlikely combination of warmth and sarcasm. Each person is shown to be a clown and a hero simultaneously, the author most of all."
5,Utterly beguiling and wonderful. Deeper than it appears,"This book is proof that each of us has plenty of material in our `ordinary' lives to use as material for writing a memoir. What most of us DON'T have, however, if Haven Kimmel's ability to write so well that what was really a very simple small-town childhood can be elevated to a 280-page book that utterly captivates. Kimmel achieves what many others have attempted to do and failed: she writes entirely from the child's voice without losing her audience, without becoming cloying, without making us want to smack her and say `get on with it.' By turns wickedly witty, humorous, poignant, sweet, heart-wrenching, wise, A Girl Named Zippy is simply one of the best books I've read this year, a poem to a happy childhood.I resisted it for over a year, fearing it was going to be a sappy, feel-good story. Wrong. It's utterly original, utterly uplifting, utterly hilarious, utterly wonderful. Do NOT fail to read this book."
2,Don't waste your time,"You know that feeling that you get when someone corners you at a party and tells you ""funny"" stories about their childhoods or college experiences? That's how I felt when I was reading this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Boring stories and boring characters."
1,Stories of cruelty to animals,I got a third of the way through this book and had to stop. Kimmel describes the way her family and her neighbors treat animals as if it is amusing. But it's actually just disturbing.
2,Odd book,"I enjoyed some of the little girl humor, but was often confused about Zippy's age throughout the book. Notice I call it a book rather then a story. I kept waiting to find a purpose for this book and never found it. I would only recommend this book at 1/3 the price because normally you get what you pay for."
1,Very disappointed,"I grew up near Mooreland, Indiana and thought this would be a fun and interesting book. Boy, was I disappointed. Yes, there were some entertaining parts in the book, but I could not finish the book as the author spent too much talking about and describing death. I wasn't even through half of the book and had to get rid of it. I really did not want to read about what the neighbor boys did to the poor, defenseless rabbits. UGH!!! Definately what I expected. One star is too much for this book."
3,"Pleasant little book, lacks an arc",I read this book because it was featured on the Today show. I was a little disappointed given the glowing praise it got. It is a pleasant book and the author has a nice writing style. The book is humorous and has a fair number of smiles although few laugh out loud parts. My biggest complaint is that book lacked an arc of a storyline. It is just some memories of her youth in a small town in Indiana. But it is a short book that can be read in a few hours so probably worthwhile.
5,Nostalgic and very funny...,"I loved this book! I would have never picked this book up had it not been for a bookclub at work, luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. This book made me remember things in my own childhood that were not only funny but best told in my adulthood.I had several friends read sections of the book and they all agreed they were funny. In addition we could see these things unfolding and sympathize with the reactions a child would have as well as the appreciation of those same moments seen with the eye of maturity."
4,A quick read that ran out of ZIP at the end,"I confess that I read this book in a few shourt hours. Fascinating. The author has captured her voice as a child admirably. The first half of the book is suprising clever and I found myself laughing outloud often, but by the end, the stories began to feel a little too over the top, like the author was trying too hard to be sensational... instead of just being her clever like she was in the beginning. Still, an awesome book."
2,A Girl Named Zippy,"Very slow reading. I'm having trouble finishing it. I bought the sequal to this book also, hope I can get to it!"
5,Three cheers for Zippy,"Zippy was loaned to me. After I read it, I knew I needed it in my house to savor as needed. The occasion and content of Zippy's first words are priceless, and I'm trying to memorize them. There's no self pity, no self-righteousness or judgment in this story of a self-possessed child sailing through what to others might be considered a precarious childhood. And it made me laugh, again and again."
2,Couldn't stand it by the end...,"The animal cruelty and the glee the author finds in retelling the stories was quite disturbing. Zippy's complete lack of compassion or empathy for animals and unfortunate humans was neither cute or entertaining.Plus, this is one of the most self-conscious memoirs I've read. The author makes a great effort to portray herself as precocious, when she was really just obnoxious and annoying. She also makes a lame attempt to show her ""intellect"" by quoting a couple of poems. It didn't work or fit into the stories she was telling."
4,"Reads like a novel, very entertaining","Haven Kimmel's account of growing up in the small town (pop 300)of Mooreland, Indiana,is a wonderful look at small town life. Small and hair deprived, she is called Zippy by her father. Quickwitted and imaginative, Haven recounts a pleasant life defined by school and church and a quirky, but supportive family. The fued between Kimmel's father and the neighbor Mr. Reed over the family dogs is hysterical. It is a world where every old lady could be a witch (until proven otherwise), you could still buy a fountain drink at the drug store, and you still believed that you could be bought from the gypsies. She remembers family,neighbors, friends and the expanding world of a child and paints it with a humerous and kind touch. This is immensely readable and provoked many memories of my own growing up."
5,Wonderfully hilarious!,"If you grew up in small town America, you will relate to this more than you'd like to admit. Be aware where you read it - when you laugh out loud, be prepared for funny looks from passersby! The sequel is worth reading, too."
4,Cool take on a child's life.,"Haven Kimmel offers a refreshign take on her life in a small town in Indiana. She captures her every day happenings in her voice as a youngster quite well and makes an average life colorful, with countless stories that will make you laugh and sadden you."
3,Zippy,This book started off very funny and I thought I hand found a real gem but it slipped into strange as it progressed and wasn't always as funny as I had anticipated from the beginning.
3,Not bad,"A cute, but bland story of a young girl named Zippy. It was a quick read with a few funny characters. My only complaint is it really isn't ""about"" anything. No indepth story, no crime, etc. just a general snapshot of a young girl in West Moreland, IN."
2,Lack of Drama,I just couldn't get into the book; I did try. I finally stopped on page 60 and speed-read the rest of it. It seemed to be well written but I felt it did not have enough drama in the plot.
4,GOOD BUT FAR FETCHED,"I gave the book 4 stars because I actually missed hearing ""Zippy's"" stories after I was finished. I wanted a sequel so she could keep on telling her life. I did think it was funny and even had a tear here and there. The thing I found most disturbing was the fact that she continuously told how she didn't believe in God. She doesn't just say it once, but every chapter is filled with her disbelief. Also, it did seem far-fetched at times. I did however find it funny and enjoyed it. As far as the animals, yeah, there are several who die, etc. But, I just saw it as small town stuff. Like when the dead baby pig gets thrown to the dog. I myself wouldn't do it, but I suppose some would and see nothing wrong with it in farm life??? If you get easily offended, I would not recommend this book. If you like feel-good, going back to when life was simple books, then you would probably like it."
5,Tells it like it is-but with a lot of humor,Haven has told her story with humor and thoughtfulness. She is a great story teller and is able to find humor in even the most human of circumstances. It's very nice to read a story that allows people to be who they are. Thanks for the trip back to the 60's!
4,Excellent compilation.,"Boy, am i glad i copped this when it was available! Rodney Franklin was one of jazz music's great pianist of the past 30 years. He put out some real nice melodic and sometimes funky grooves for us jazz lovers. The only reason i gave this a 4 star rating was because they left off one of his most popular signature songs. ""Song For You"" was my jam and quite a nice romantic recording. How do you leave that track of all songs off of this greatest hits compilation. It's a shame that this disc is no longer available for the fans to go out and purchase. It is a truly must have for real jazz fans."
5,AWESOME COLLECTION!!!,"In 1988-90 there was a company called Oak Lawn Records in Dallas, Texas who produced some of the most unique and coolest music ever. Only problem? Only available on vinyl. Then in 2006 this collection became available ON CD!!! It would be worth the money for the CCCP tracks alone, MCL and VIM too? AWESOME!! The track-listing is not complete but this compilation covers all the good stuff with remixes included!!! Buy it today and enjoy it forever!!"
3,Madam Blavatsky: The Woman Behind the Myth,This is a very well written book although I was quite surprised by the story of Madam Blavatsky. A little dissapointed at the least. As I have looked up to Madam Blavatsky and have heard nothing but good stories about her until I read this book.
3,"Clear, but uncomfortable after a while","Clear , but uncomfortable after a while arove the ears. Not sure why. The price was great as well and I got them fast. But they serve their purpose."
4,"DARK, AMBIENT AND ROOTS INFLUENCED!!","As a fan of reggae music this album is probaly the most interesting of anything I have ever heard. There is no other reggae album that captures the atmosphere it projects. It is dark and beautiful. The deep slow bass lines are roots reggae. But this one may be a little out there for the hard core roots reggae lovers. Adrian Sherwood has been criticized for over producing material (the over use of studio gimmicks). However, this project is stripped right down to the bone. This is recommended for the fans of reggae that is a little progressive."
2,not as shown,I too ordered these boots for my daughter for christmas but they are not as shown. There is NO rubber sole! They will get ruined in no time. Back they go and now I'm scrambling a week before christmas to find the ones I want. Ugh!
2,NO SOLE like the pic. MISLEADING!!!!!!!,"I realize after getting them in the mail, that the description says soft sole. Duh on my part, but in the picture there is the rubber sole. That made me think I was ordering them with the rubber sole. I will be sending them back to order the mocs with the sole."
1,Product missrepresented.,Super disappointed with this company (shoemart). They sent a pair of boots that did not have the rubber sole as depicted. I felt it was a misrepresentation of the product. I tried to exchange them for the ones in the photo but they don't carry them. I asked to be reimbursed for return shipping because of this but customer service was quite rude. They did not return my calls or appologize for their mistake and would not refund shipping. Bad business in my opinion. I had never had any issues ordering from amazon in the past and this is the first time I have ever written a negative review.
2,Don't Buy the Same Books Twice!,"This trilogy contains two books previously published under the title ""A Convinient Marriage"" back in 1996. Don't buy the same books again! They were so boring, that I actually got more than 20 pages into the first story, before ""deja vu"" hit me!"
1,Is this REALLY Stephanie Laurens?,"I've read a few of her Cynster novels and found them very interesting but this? I only read the first two and I quit. The stories seem to drag with no true character development and no sensual love scenes. I hated their pettiness and dumb arguments. I will not give up on Stephanie, because I know she can write BETTER than this. Until next time."
1,Yawn,"... The stories and characters, perhaps due to their shortness, were bland. Because they involved members of the same family, I expected crossover of characters to weave the three stories together and compensate for the abreviated character development. There was none and I was left feeling slightly cheated. I guess I shouldn't expect 3 great romances for the price of one. ..."
3,Catalina Magdalena Hoopensteiner Wallendiner Hogan Logan Bogan Was Her Name,I did not like the way the spine was repaired. I don't remember if this was part of the description when it was purchased. It was done with packaging tape. I took it apart and did it with book repair tape.
3,tough to open and close,A great tool but very difficult to operate with one hand. Dangerous if not careful.. Stanley no help with problem.
3,Classic Monstor Trucks cant be beat,"Anyone who's anyone has to have a Monstor Trucks in their gaming collection. It's easy to get hooked on this game. First, go for the free trial version on the Microsoft website, then, once you decide you are having fun, buy it here at Amazon. This CD loads easily into my XP system. There were no techincal problems. You get half a dozen tracks and trucks to choose from. My son and i have two XP systems networked through our Internet connection and therefore can use the multiplayer gaming option to play against each other. Also, you can add trucks and tracks to your *.pod file to extend your library of playing options. [...]. Oveall, we enjoye this game. I give the graphics a good 3 stars, but really not the best since it was produced in the '90's. For the price, give it a try."
5,Looks great...,I bought this poster for my dorm room and I'm really happy with it. At first I was worried the size might be too big but it looks great and the quality is fantastic. I bought another poster from a different online store and the paper quality can't compare. This one is much thicker and has a better finish. It's obvious when they're side by side because this one is darker but richer in color.
1,eb% Vibrant Eyes,This product was a waste of money. One of my 80 year old clients asked me to order it for her so I did and purchased some for my self. It did not have any promising results.
5,Buster Baxter Cat Saver,"My class of first graders loved this story. This story hasfunny things happen to the characters. Arthur is upset because Busterthinks he is better than everyone. This story has many plots and mysteries as Buster's friends try to show him that he is not as brave as he thinks. It is easy to read and easy to follow, but NOT BORING!"
5,To the point.,"Did you ever just want a book get to the point and tell you what you need to know? This is that book. If your new to winsock, this book will get you rolling quickly."
5,Brilliant!,"This book delivers a good understanding of sockets. I have read one or two other books regarding the subject. The thing I like about this one is A) the whole book is dedicated to it. B) Its explanations are probably the best I have read regarding any topic in programming. Remember first starting C++, and the first chapters of the book taught you how to add integers? You kind of sit there saying ""Yeah, Yeah, get on with the hard stuff"". As a total compliment: That is how this books makes you feel about sockets! The explanations and examples almost make it impossible to believe it is really that simple."
2,Disappointed!!!,"I am disappointed with this bag. The purse is not firm sided, it is floppy and has no body to it. The picture makes it look like it would stand up on its own. However this bag is like a wrinkly old 70's purse. I do not like the thick strap which is wooly and hot. The zipper is too large and very hard to zip."
3,"Good for the price, but one issue.","First I should say that the overall quality of the bag is pretty good. It's a good size - it had plenty of room (even for a bottle of water) without looking huge. It lays nice and flat against the body, and the strap is wide enough that it's comfortable on the shoulder, even when loaded down.There's really one thing I think you should be aware of though: The zippers do not function very well. (I don't think mine is defective, it's really just the zippers.) I'm sure a lot of you know what I mean - the zipper is CONSTANTLY getting caught and the ""teeth"" are really big. Not smooth-functioning at all! It wasn't enough to make me want to return it, but I'm sure I won't use it as often as I'd hoped. I spread a bit of liquid dish soap along the zippers (a tip from my Mum) and it has helped a bit. So, if this is something that really irritates you, I'd suggest another bag!"
1,es la resena mas tonta e incompleta que he visto,yo creo que esta resena es de lo mas peor apesta y estoy tan decepcionada que jamas volvere a comprar una resena de nadie.
5,This is one of those *MUST HAVES* for baby,"I LOVED this for my little girl when she was a baby. She never liked blankets and neither did I for fear of it covering her face. So when I found these Halo sleepers, I was soooo happy. They are perfect for the baby and they are so roomy & snuggly at the same time.I would just have her in a little onsies and then put her in the Halo sleeper and she was set for the night. The arm openings are big enough to allow some air and movement for the little ones arms.I have 2 pregnant friends and I am going to highly recommend this to them. When I have #2 this will be on my MUST HAVE list for sure!They have them in fleece & blanket material so you can't go wrong for any season. :)"
3,hungry for such kind of book,Client/Server Application is one of the hottest topic in today tech field. The chance to understand concept how to programming is rare to find. This book :Multi-Threaded Programming in C++ is a great help to freshment or junior level programer.
3,Math yuk!!,"I was only a little miffed when I got to class and noticed that this book did not come with the lab (MATHXL) registration information. I had used the specific ISBN number that should have had the Book, CD lectures and the MATHXL registration I ended up spending more money for that."
4,"Good quality, SLOW shipping",The book was exactly as described. The seller however was super slow when it came to shipping. It took me a month to get this book.
2,not a good experience,"did not have a good experience with this seller, the description of the item did not reflect the same thing when I received it. cover was torn. returned the book but did not get a full refund."
3,"IF YOU BUY NEW, IT DOES NOT COME WITH EVERYTHING!","The book itself was great but it does not come with the supplements like the description says! I bought it brand new from Amazon (not an authorized seller) twice due to Mymathlab not being included and both did not come with Mymathlab! When I called customer service they even stated that the supplements were included. So, needless to say I am sending back the second book and back to square one. Beware! The description is not correct you are better off going to the manufacturer's website and getting the whole package without the headache!"
1,Don't buy this book,Don't buy this book!Yes there are pictures..good ones at that but besides the names of the plants you know nothing about the plant. It would be well and good as a coffee table coaster and an expensive one at that.
3,good referance,"dont expect alot in terms of care guides, as they are brief and already, somwhat dated (eg, tepot indicates that metal halides are the only way to light planted tanks: simply not true). but it has an exalent encyclopdia of both true aquatic and terrestrial plants often sold as aquatic. again, its a good referance."
3,Highly technical treatment of the topic.,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. The pictures are absolutely wonderful but I had difficulty tying the text and pictures together. I must admit some of the text was over my head. All in all, I am not sorry I bought this book. Posibly someday, it may prove invaluable for me."
2,Disappointing Story,"This film's plot did not exactly meet with the description I had read. It was described as being a thriller revenge story with suspense and tension, and it could have been that, too. Instead, it bogged down and lost my interest. I still watched to see if there would be revenge, though we didn't get to see a revenge plot develop as I had hoped. It's well-acted but not very interesting."
3,Newspaper stories of the Spanish Civil War,"This is a New York Times book. The book has taken a collection of stories of different types to paint a picture of the SpanishCivil War. These stories reflect the internationalization of the war with Germany and Italy's active commitment.I learned some things from this book that are missing in other books on this war. First, Nazi Germany's Naval blockade of the Spanish coast, while actively helping Franco and the rebels. Also the Loyalists targeting of Nazi naval units, plus their barbarism against conservatives and clericals. Many contemporary books portray the Rebels as the villians, but perhaps both sides can share this label to an equal extent. Since these are stories that appear in the newspapers, some of the facts are wrong and this is why I gave it three stars."
1,Good Movie - Awful Print,"It is unfortunate when a classic is treated with such disregard and carelessness as this one has been.The film quality is 'ok' but with some fuzzy scenes and a few missing frames and film burn here and there. The sound is of poor quality, dropping off to near silence at many points. To add insult to injury, my copy came complete with a manufacturing defect that stops the film short of it's conclusion.All is not lost however... ""Reel Enterprises"" was kind enough to include a persistant watermark of it's logo in the lower right hand corner throughout the entire film. Otherwise I would have definitly thought this was a bootleg or Korean import.A real shame for such an otherwise great film.No menu, no extras, no frills but cheap at $10.00"
2,propaganda plus,"Good cast, some well-orchestrated scenes, but a strange choice for to be made by the director of ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and Lilian Hellman at her worst. The ""happy singing peasants"" as a chorus of saintly comrades is especially cloying. Look instead to two other very similar films (with some of the same cast members): DRAGON SEED and, especially, the far superior EDGE OF DARKNESS."
3,Hollywood pornography with no sex,"North Star is the very BEST example of 1930s Hollywood communist sympathizers kissing up to Uncle Joe Stalin personally. The result is pure pornography in the truest sense. Picture a farm commune in which everyone has too much to eat. Yeah! They are attacked by the evil Nazis who begin medical experiments within 5 minutes. Only the partisans 100% loyal to Uncle Joe can save them! This film is actually more one-sided in its ""white"" depiction of heroic, happy poverty-stricken communists vs. ""black"" aristocratic Nazi torturers than anything either Ilya Ehrenberg or Joseph Goebbels ever dreamed of. Amazing stuff!"
4,Five years later and we were told to hate these people!,Here we have Walter Brennan and Dean Jagger leading an all star castin a movie telling how brave the Russian people are.There were several of these early 40's war movies showingour solidarity with the Russian against the Germans.The same governments turned on each other just a short time further on.In a time when the KGB has fallen we still have the CIA:they are the same sort of beast as these governmentsthat tell us to love them one year and hate them the next?There is a lesson here of history.
2,Ok for beginners,"I am a dancer and use pilates to keep my muscles toned and my body flexible. I like Moira Stott who is not in your face but rather calm and detailed in instructing. This video of hers I found too easy for me, though I'm sure a beginner would enjoy it if they like slow, controlled toning."
4,enjoyed this workout,"I am a video workout enthusiast, and enjoyed this workout. Moira Stott's soothing instructions is as easy or as hard as you want it to be. Excellent cuing, without bouncy, hyper movements. Enjoyed this tape and highly recommend it."
3,kindle sample not helpful,the kindle sample contains less than one page by author. it has a looonngg essay about the author and the stories. totally worthless as a sample of the book.
3,Muito bom....:)),Este Cd é do melhor.Principalmente no dia de passagem de ano...1999!!!!! Alto som!!!Great Sound!!! Don't try to search for the next music because they start and end in the same way!!! Don't leave your home Without It!!!
5,Wonderful and Inspiring True Story,"It is clear how much the author loved, respected and admired Monique. This personal memoir is well written and gripping. I could not put it down. Besides giving us a very intimate view of one inspirtational woman's life, we also get a clear picture of what life is like in rural Mali."
2,how to love Africa?,"I am reading the book Monique and the mango rains.I also lived for many years in Ghana and I am discovering the so many similarities in those West African cultures and traditions. The daily life described by Kris is exactly the copy of a day in Ghana in the rural areas.So congratulations to Kris for the ability in transferring images and emotions.I have some reserves however because eventually it seems that also Kris fell sick with the ""Aid workers syndrome"": willing to be involved but in reality totally distant from the souls of those people. It is the main sin of the Aid Workers: the pride dressed under an appearance of humility.No problem: it is the commonest sin and can be forgiven if only there is repentance.I suggest the reading of Dead Aid of Dambisa Moyo; The lords of Poverty of Graham Hancock; My African Mission (written by myself).A friend of Africa"
5,fantastic,"A wonderful story of friendship and an interesting look at life in the Peace Corps and Mali in the 80's. The author's style is so easy to read; I felt like she was sitting next to me, telling me her story."
4,An Inside Look at Malian Culture,I loved the glimpse of life in Mali and the opportunity to learn of such an exceptional person as Monique. It was amazing to see her excel as a midwife working with such rudimentary facilities. She was a truly outstanding human being who rose up out of adversity. I think most readers with a curiosity about the world would enjoy her story.
4,Great Real Life Story,This was a great real life story about a Peace Corp member and her experience working with a midwife in Mali. Recommended for anyone going into the medical field.
4,The Power of Shared Womanity,"I would never have taken the time to read this book for pleasure. I read it as a course assignment, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it and how emotionally invested I became in Monique's and Kris's journeys. Their shared experience of being women who care about others and spend their life energy helping others bridged the gap between their cultures. The values Kris brought to the Peace Corps enabled her to affect people's lives beyond the boundaries of her official duties. I was so happy to hear in the discussion that took place in my class, that Kris is still going strong and making a difference around the world. One person can make a difference. A woman who cares can make a huge difference. No matter how many obstacles prevent us from changing everything that we think needs to be changed, the things we are able to do still make a huge difference. Keep on keeping on, sisters!"
2,Slow,I did not finish this book because it was very slow and dragged on. But i do intend to finish it because i would like to find out what was accomplished for these women through the help of Monique and the Peace Corp
4,Good,"This book was good. It is worth reading if you are interested in women's health, public health, birthing, or in Mali in general. The author uses her personal relationship with Monique, the town midwife, to teach about village life and health care in Mali."
4,Great!,"I got this book really fast, I was so surprised to find it in my mail today. Thank You :) I am really Satisfied, already read the first Chapter this morning. I Love this Book, has so many wonderfull details."
2,Ripoff!,"What a rip off! This is basically a boardgame copy of, this game: [...]You would definitely be better off playing the original."
2,Interesting story not very well executed,An interesting story not very well executed. Kind of fun as an experiment in making a Gory Western and definitely with a dark view of humanity.The story is set in Idaho but filmed in Spain. I grew up in the area where the movie is supposed to take place and the exteriors filmed in the Pyrenees mountains look surprisingly like they were filmed in the Central Idaho mountains.
1,"Return to ""Get A Clue""","This is one of the least interesting books I've read in a very long time. No drama, no plot other than perhaps a middle-aged lawyer reliving his own disaffection w/ his comfortable family & wife & falling for a beautiful young woman. The history of New Orleans as related by the author is quite good, but as a book, a novel, give me a break. Perhaps this might fall into a category of ""reimagined autobiography"". A novel it isn't, that's for sure. The story line is trite, the writing brittle and boring. This book has about as much suspense, drama and engaging scenes as a walk down a midwestern street on a football Saturday. There ain't nothin' happenin' there. Please don't waste your time."
4,Nice book,"Pleasant Valley gives me a glimpse into early life in Ohio. From Indians to through the Industrial Revolution, from farms to factories..changing life in Ohio and the midwest as people expanded west. Interesting look at families and life."
3,A 30 dollar tripod is a 30 dollar tripod.,"I was slightly disappointed in this product for several reasons1. It is quite heavy. A far cry from the lightweight tripods.2. Despite it's heaviness, it is quite wobbly. Not terribly so, but definitely noticeable.3. There is no bubble level. Almost all tripods have this, why not this one?4. The mechanisms to regulate tightness are marginal.5. No carrying bag included.6. Overall marginal quality.Things I do like:1. Removable camera holder2. Quite tall!3. sustains much weight4. Semi-compact"
4,Not just for holding up a camera,"I wouldn't use this tripod for a camera, unless it were a tiny point-and-shoot. I use it as a speedlight stand for off-camera flash. Its best attribute is the fact that it can have a tiny footprint - no more than a 4 inch circle. Great for hiding lights behind things when photographing a room. Compact, lightweight, easy to use."
4,great,"Not as perfect as #1, but still very good. Perhaps too many plot directions happening at once - also some things a little hard to believe as compared to in the first book, such as the convenient stampeded of mammoths. Can't wait for the next 4 in this series to be published in English. NBM, Dargaud, please hurry!"
2,Not catastic.,Unfortunately our resident purr becomes too distracted by the rolling huming ball to chase the mice. The overall emotional effect of the cat is closer to fear and confusion than to playfulness.
5,"Elvis, The King Of Rock, And Roll",This is a great set for any Elvis fan. If your a new fan or have loved him for years.It has so much to offer besides his music. I really recommend it because you get hours of joy from it.
5,From Nashville to Memphis,This was a must have for my Elvis library. It was just a little disapointing as I was looking for a couple songs that I hoped were on it but were not but it is still well worth the money
4,Glad to see I'm not the only person who HIGHLY appreciates,the 60s ELVIS! How so many songs went by unheard and underappreciated is a crime.-20 something Elvis fan.
1,Dont Buy It!!!,"Horrible TV--The first day we had it, the tv would get 'stuck' on a digital channel it was trying to tune in and would be unusable for about 10 minutes to half an hour. The second day, the bloody thing wouldn't even turn on either by remote or the power button on the tv. Shell out a few extra $ for a Sony instead."
4,"Excellent acting, intelligent script. Entertaining.","Entertaining, high quality film making here.A little slow in the middle but ultimately satisfying story about smart kids working hard to make sense of their world. Outstanding performances by the actors."
5,From the Publisher,"""The National Museum of Women in the Arts was founded in 1987 to celebrate the diverse artistic achievements of women, challenging traditional histories of art and uncovering the works of women artists who have been overlooked and unacknowledged. The images collected here are a brief but striking introduction to art created by women, ranging over nearly three hundred years, from the eighteenth through the twentieth century. Included are works by Mary Cassatt, Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keeffe and Berthe Morisot.""Pomegranate's books of postcards contain thirty top-quality reproductions bound together in a handy, artful collection. Easy to remove and produced on heavy card stock, these stunning postcards are a delight to the sender and receiver. ISBN: 0-7649-1365-4; size: 4 3/4 x 6 7/8"".""-- Pomegranate"
2,Okay if you know what you're doing already,"I ordered this book as I needed a step by step refresher of everything mathematics including order of operations for algebraic expressions. This book is great if you need some extra problem sets to help enhance what you know. If you have forgotten how to do the math and need a step by step refresher, do not buy this book. The author sets up the example without explaining why it is set up that way and then gives an answer to the problem without showing how it is solved. It leaves somebody like me very frustrated."
3,too confusing,It is not for someone who is lost already!!!i was too confused to understand. had to get something else
5,Very helpful,When you've been out of school for a long time its good to refresh and this book definitely helped me do that.
2,Disappointing for a Schaum's,"I've used Schaum's texts numerous times for everything from bookkeeping to algebra and thought they were extremely helpful and well-organized, so I was surprised by how rushed the presentation in this book is. The ""solved"" problems jump from a to b to z with no explanation of the steps involved or, often, even the formulas used. I ended up using Google to find better explanations to answer the problems and finally just gave up on this book. Hopefully the precalculus is better."
2,Not very useful.,This text was required for a graduate level math class. I ordered it before the class started and wish I had waited. I didn't find this useful at all. I found more useful information on the internet (for free).
3,Secrets and More,"Austin Clarke's novel The Polished Hoe is a noel with a purpose. Like George Lamming's novel In the Castle of My Skin, it is a critique of European colonialism and the imposition of European history on the Island of Barbados. The novel is the murder confession of the main character Mary Mathilda. On top of that it is the history of Barbados as Mary Mathilda has observed and lived. Mary Mathilda has been forced to be the mistress of Mr. Bellfeels, the manager of the plantation where Mary and her family have worked for generations. Since she was a teenager Mary was forced to be Mr. Bellfeels' woman and she has finally done something about it. Through a series of revelations, we find out the plantation's secrets and see the effects of colonialism.I enjoyed this novel. The main story line was entertaining and kept me interested. When Mary went off on tangents in the middle of the story, I became disenchanted with the novel, but overall it's an enjoyable read."
3,The Polished Hoe,"Austin Clark's novel, The Polished Hoe, takes place on the island of Bimshire (referring to Barbados). The novel begins with Mary Gertrude Mathilda, a respected woman throughout her community, calling the police station to confess a crime she has committed. When Sargent Percy Stuart is sent over to record her story he tries to stop her, for he has been in love with this woman for quite some time and it is hard for him to hear such a tragedy. The novels spans across a 24 hour period where Mary Mathilda recounts her life story, telling of the disgraceful acts against her that led up to her murderous rampage. She tells of the lifelong sexual and physical violence of the plantation owner, Mr. Bellfeels, which she has had to endure.The book starts out pretty slow when she is reminiscing on the history of her life and the plantation but it then eases into the good stuff. The story also tends to jump around quite a bit with time and place, which could be confusing to the reader at times."
2,The Polished Hoe Unraveled,"The Polished Hoe is a novel about a woman confessing to a crime. But while she confesses her crime to the police sergeant, who is also her childhood friend and romantic interest, she gives a historical account of Barbados, or Bimshire, the island she lives on, and herself. The novel is in stream of consciousness style, which tends to be confusing as the characters bounce randomly from topic to topic as they reflect on memories and events, but does give the story a flavor of authenticity that would be absent in a more traditional writing style. The novel takes place in a single, extremely long and drawn out night, during which the main character Mary Mathilda leads up to and finally states her confession. The story is not really about the confession itself, but Mary Mathilda's motivations, which derive from the hardships of the post-colonial life of blacks in Barbados and other parts of the Caribbean."
2,I thought it was just me,"Got halfway through this book (and I mean page 236) and said enough!!! Although I think the history is a good one and the story could have been a good one, the rambling narrative, skipping from past to present, skipping between the dialogue of one character to the other, going from the thought of one person to that of another etc., made this story very difficult to read. In essence, it was more work than enjoyment."
2,It Wore Me Out!,"This book became such a tiresome experience! I read a lot (more than most professional book reviewers, I'll bet), and this is one that I'm not exactly sure how it has garnered some of the acclaim it has. It is steady flow of digressions and tangets and ho-hum prose. If I wrote a short story in the same style for a literature class, I would receive a failing grade. The basic plot carries some intrigue, and would probably make an excellent story under different circumstances. But it takes the entire book of 400+ pages to advance a mere 24 hours. Rather than being a book that you can't put down, it is an exercise in reading a book that you would rather put down. I suggest you skip it and read The Known World (Pulitzer prizer winner Edward P. Jones) if you're looking for a moving book that will teach you about slavery."
2,Too wordy,"My favorite book is Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, closely followed by The Hours. Pilgrim shows you that I like words - when they're selected well. The Hours tells you that I appreciate brevity - why take 500 pages to describe what can be done in 200? This book was far longer than it needed to be. Verbosity for the sake of length does not make for a great read."
3,Caribbean Queen,"The pace of the narrative mirrors that of the characters it is about - island time. If you're looking for brain candy that you'll speed through in a couple hours, this isn't it. But it's pretty good if not quite great and I'd definitely recommend this novel to fans of well written literary fiction."
3,repetitive and wordy,"this is the first of this author's books i have read, impulsively ordering it after hearing of his award. I am less than 1/3 of the way through and doubt will finish, having scanned through to the end, little changes. honest, well written characters do not make up for the repetitiveness and general boredom of this book."
3,A good read albeit a circuitous one,"I am always interested in Caribbean fiction. This is definitely not a quick read on the train ride home. This book brings the horror of the slavery and post-slavery era home. Up close and personal. By telling the stories of the characters in his book, Clarke forces the reader to take a bigger bite of what has already left a bad taste in the mouth. The struggles of the ""heroine"", Mary Matilda, her mother and grandmother as well as the other characters in the book are painstakingly painted. I must say though that I found the pace a little slow at time. Clarke shifts between time and place, stretching dialogue and story to the near breaking point.Altogether a good read but be patient. Reminds me of ""A Hundred Years Of Solitude"".ShermanCaribbeanAbroad.com"
1,Madly uninteresting!,I hated this book! Apparently Clarke's motto goes something like...why use ten words when you can use a thousand! Overwritten in the extreme - this is one long and painful read.
1,What books did this one beat inorder to win the Giller?,Oh My God! This book is torturous. I have read the above reviews and saw where someone notes that it's at the last 10 pages that we discover who's been murdered.The last 10 pages??? I just cannot do that to myself. Sorry. If I had a cat I would put the pages of The Polished Hoe to a more suitable use...Sheesh...
1,Didn't get past page 25,"When I picked up this book, going by the description, I was so excited to read it. However, as I started plugging along, I just could not get into the story and narrator at all. I rarely ever put down a book, only when I feel that I will not enjoy any reading of it, and I did put this book down. It was so bad, I just couldn't go on. And judging by the other reviews, seems I'm not the only one. Very disappointed."
2,This book is terrible!,"Man this book was awful! I took it out of the library b/c it had won the Govenor General's Award, so I figured it had to be good. Boy was I ever wrong!This book is dull. It is s-l-o-w moving from start to finish and it is written in this slang type speech (which I suppose was common for the age but) which makes it very difficult to read. So put all of these issues in a blender and you have one horrible book/story.Avoid this book like the plague."
2,Boring,"Half way through this book, I didn't care who killed whom with what. I just wanted it to be over! It was repetative, droning, and had too much detail! I wanted to visualize everything, but the narrative made me lose interest by the time the speaker got to the point. I always stick with a book no matter how boring, but this one, I should've left alone. I did sympathize with Mary's struggle, but I wish this book was paced better."
1,Ok for the first few days.....,"We purchased this stroller for my three year old daughter for Christmas, it looked so cute and I had read a few good reviews about it however looks can be very deceiving. It was not very easy to put together and when you do finally get it put together the canopy just breaks off anyways along with the tray just alltogether I was not satisfied with it at all so we are just going to end up throwing it out and purchasing hopefully a better one! My suggestion would be not to buy it especially if your child wants to play with it everyday like mine."
2,DONT BUY..JUNK JUNK JUNK,I just want to say that all of these ocean wonders doll accessories are junk.. I got them for my girls (who are 3 1/2 and 1) for Christmas.. we bought everything there was and it was 150 dollars.. I bought these for them since we had all the ocean wonders stuff for my one year old when she was a baby and as soon as I saw it.. I knew I had to have it.. Boy was I wrong.. nothing stays together.. kids being kids.. my one year old sat in the stroller and it bent it.. the swing will not stay together.. the highchair broke after only having it for 10 min.. I mean need I say more.. I am really upset about having to return this stuff because I was so excited about it.. but I can not keep it because it is not worth what was paid for it !!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS.. You will regret it
2,Snap-ons Snap off!!,"I have to agree with the other folks to complained about the durability of this stroller. The snap-on attachments snap off WAY too easily. I would have rather spent an extra 10 minutes putting it together with a few screws than having to re-attach the canopy and the little Ocean Wonders thing all the time. My 2-year old daughter loves it though! Also, the ""mommy"" tray at the top of the handle is totally for show. It would have been nice if the cup holder would have been big enough and deep enough to actually HOLD a sippy cup, but oh well.She's perfectly happy with it--it's Mommy and Daddy who are a bit disappointed in this Fisher-Price toy."
2,stroller durability,"Having 3 granddaughters, I purchased several pieces of the ""Ocean Wonders"" doll accessories. I am very disappointed in the quality of the product. Assembly was easy, however the pieces keep falling off, coming unsnapped, and overall poor quality. Given the price of each of the items and the Fisher Price brand I expected more of a durable product."
2,Return!!!,We bought this for my 2 year old daughter. It was difficult to assemble. The fish tray and canopy cover keep popping off the stroller. We were better off buying a less expensive one that doesn't have all of the fancy bells and whistles! We are returning it for sure!
4,A Pretty Toy (The whole collection),"I first saw this stroller online and i knew this would be the one i would buy. I actually have a graco one, and i had a graco travel system on layaway at another store. To get to the point, we just opened this stroller and put it together, it was very tedious to put together and i feel that the manufacture could have put more of it together. Some of the parts dont fit as i feel they should, kids are rough and toys should be made to handle a few bumps without popping out of place. I am happy with this product and I may be a little biased because i am just in love with the print and the little things that make this stroller different. If you want a very durable stroller that will last very long try Graco, but if you don't mind little defects get this one, it really is beautiful."
2,Already returned one...,"My mother bought this as a christmas present for my daughter. The print is so cute and it looks adorable! However assembly is not easy. My mom tried to put the first stroller together but mis-read the directions, so I took it back and got another. I just got done putting it together and I had the worst time putting the bady doll seat onto the frame. It doesn't ""snap"" into place like the directions claim. Hopefully with more time they improve this product."
2,Do not waste your money,I bought this stroller because of the little fish bowl that attatches. When my husband put it together the whole frame was bent. There was no way to straighten it out. It looked horrible. The sun shade couldn't be attatched because of how bent the carriage was. The fish bowl played this horrible music that was not appealing. If you tried to adjust the stroller a little bit the seat would pop off. I bought my daughter the graco one too and had no problems with it. I was really disappointed because this stroller was real cute and I liked the basket that hung on the back.I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it because I am sure they are all going to be bent somewhere and then you will just have to pack it all up again.
3,Not what I expected,"I am an intermediate level Pilates practioner who has taken a few classes. The description on the cover of this tape led me to expect a fast-moving, challenging intermediate level workout. Instead, this tape turned out to be a relatively slow-moving Pilates practice which would be more appropriate for beginners. Many of the exercises are modified versions of the classic Pilates moves, but those brand-new to Pilates might have difficulties following along, as there is only limited instruction given by Moira Stott to her two students. This workout would be best suited to advanced beginners who want a workout that moves at a steady pace and can be completed in under 30 minutes."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"My 8 year old son loves science related investigations and toys. I remember Capsela from my childhood and thought my son would love it too. And he was pretty excited while building the first assembly but once he had that one built there wasn't really any challenge in building the other configurations. Also, we have one piece that fits very loosely into the connector which causes a problem keeping the unit together."
5,A classic,I Have not heard this album in many years. It was great to hear it again. Lots of pleasant memories.
5,A neat little book,"Sarna's book guides the reader through Exodus, and tries to place it in the context of other Middle Eastern cultures (while at the same time not ignoring the key differences between Israel and its polytheistic neighbors). The book is full of interesting little tidbits: for example, ""Mose"" (meaning ""son"" or ""one who is born"" in Egyptian) was commonly a part of ancient Egyptian names, and kings had names like ""Thut-mose"" (so it makes sense that the egyptians would name a baby ""Moses"" or some variant thereof). Basically a work of history rather than theology--that is, it doesn't really purport to address the big questions of who wrote Exodus, etc. Rather, it shows readers how Exodus made sense to ancient readers familiar with heathen customs."
2,OK for MP3 or ipods.,"The cord is on the left ear side and it is short. Too short for a home stereo system, but OK for, say, an MP3 player in your shirt pocket...arm band, or belt.Sound is a bit subpar, but not the worst I've ever heard.Found mine at Big Lots for 10.00!"
2,dated,"the rest of my workshop class liked this, but 5 years later, i wouldn't plan on re-reading it, and i doubt that any of my classmates would take it as seriously. sophomoric."
1,ripoff,"I want to rate this ""no stars"". The price is a ripoff. Barons is just as good, especially for NY, and $30.00 cheaper."
1,"Terrible But, You Do Not Have a Choice","This, so called book, is at best a cheap xerox copy of some intresting information. The information is very standard however, it currently is the only available book regarding the Tahitian Language. The book itself is terrible. Pages are not straight, finger printed pages, hard to read light and dark areas within the pages. For the price it isnt worth it. It should be price at about $1.00 since thats about the quality of workmanship the publisher used when producing the book. I am in the printing industry and if I produced such poor quality I would be out of business. Be ready if you choose this book."
1,its'not goonvery very bad the book.,i'mnot spiking english but a shiping este book end son puras hojas copiadas realmente no VALE LOS 26.20 Q PAGUE POR EL ES UNA MINIATURA THE BOOK DEBERIAN COBRAR 2 DOLLARES POR EL MEN.I DON'T BELIVED IDON'T TO RECOMMEND.I SORRY .
5,"sticky rocks like a band should ,no-frills, sonic ear candy","as a music fan from austin, tx, i love this band. they truly rock. what happened to this band? i heard that they disbanded, what a shame. this ep, doublesuperbuzz will be classic in the future. once the post alternative dust clears and the immitators are gone this will remain as a true rock record. if you like the replacements, big star, acdc, the flaming lips,the velvet underground, the beatles, archers of loaf, superchunk, neil young, etc. you need this record. really, seriously. buy it, you'll love it."
3,What a wonderful story.....,"Deb Stover, takes an engaging idea and weaves a wonderful story. The plot and Zach & Hilary's story are worth reading. My biggest disappointment is in the writing itself. There was vey little description, and the plot flies along. One minute Zach arrives in his deserted ghosttown, and the next day they are madly in love, declaring their undying devotion to each other. (Besides the fact that Zach thinks Hilary is certifiably crazy.)Ms. Stover also tackles the disease of alcohalism. This is a very tough topic, especially in a romance novel, and she does a commendable job. I don't know how accurate some of the ideas she portrays are (like getting someone to stop, and so vehemently, just by talking to them for a few minutes, it usually takes a bigger impetus than that), but the idea that she tries, is great. Showing Zach's fight against wanting to take a drink when things get bad, is heartwrenching. Definitely worth reading for a ""pick me up""."
3,Good game but feezes,"Dracula Unleashed is a great game, the only problem with it is that it freezes during game play through out different parts of the game. Very frustrating."
1,Garbage,"We bought a tube of this at a local store because it was specifically marketed for ""kitchen and bath"" use, and we figured it'd hold up well against the rigors of the damp bathroom environment. Not so! After carefully cleaning, caulking, and waiting for this stuff to cure, my wife and I happily resumed taking showers. Not a week later trouble began: our new caulk turned to goo. This stuff is NOT waterproof, and should not be used anywhere where there's even a slight chance that it will get damp (in my case, that means it just shouldn't be used). I HIGHLY recommend that you consider other caulks."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,My husband just caulked our bathroom shower. We waited 2 days before running any water. As soon as the caulk got wet it turned into mush and began peeling away. It will be going back to Ace. Very disappointing as it was highly recommended at the store.
1,Caulk that's not waterproof?,"I followed the directions exactly and nowhere was it thick at all and waited the 24hours. I took a shower then before I left I checked out the tub and the caulk was flaking off. Maybe I didn't wait long enough? I removed everything, cleaned it up, applied it and waited one week. After the first shower the stuff was flaking off again. Completely worthless and a waste of time."
1,Failed,Lots of prep work and three days without the shower operating just to be on the safe side. The first shower caused the apparently dry seals to ribbon up and pull from the joint. I am beyond frustrated with this product. Don't use around water.
4,Great for decoden,"Yes, I know. This is supposed to be for kitchens and baths. I got this for decoden. If you don't know what that is, it's a hobby of decorating phone cases. I use this as the frosting. It is quite white and it does the job.It doesn't dry squishy like most caulk but pretty hard. It takes days to dry though. It dries faster if you leave it in front of a fan. I haven't tested the case in water but according to the other reviews, it doesn't seem like it would be a good idea. Good thing phone cases are not meant to be in water anyway.In short, if you're buying this for phone case decorating, do so without hesitation. Just make sure it is completely dry. If you are patient, wait 3-4 days. Leave it in front of a COOL fan to speed up the process. If you're buying this for kitchen and bath, it seems like you should look somewhere else."
1,Kwik Seal & Kwik Failure,"Followed the instructions to the letter (including in-depth removal of old caulk and cleaning). Six months after applying around my tub, it is, literally, falling away from the cracks.UPDATE six months after the Kwik Seal failure:Recommendation: use GE Silicone II, Kitchen and Bath. Six months after using it, it is still in perfect condition."
1,Not even worth 1 Star,"This stuff is a joke. Like many other reviews, I followed the instructions to the letter, and probably waited a little more than 24-hours. Before we even showered it was not looking promising and after the shower it was peeling. Wish I would have read these reviews before I put so much effort into this project."
2,not b-room savvy,"like others said wont hold up in high water areas, left two days for drying. but miniscule amounts saturate in water had to redo shower"
1,Doesn't stay in cack.,I used it in my shower. Cleaned the shower thoughly. It stretched over a couple of days and came right out of the crack. I tried 6 times. One time I even stayed out of the shower for a week. It came out again. After six months it is getting worse an worse. The entire seal has stretched out. It looks like a ribbon.
2,Does not work well with water.,"DAP really needs to revise the label on these tubes. Its advertised as kitchen and bath but does not work well in tubs, showers or anywhere that sees a lot of water. After a thorough cleaning, and waiting over 2 days for the caulk to cure, areas of the caulk already started peeling up after the first shower.It works ok on areas like counter tops, around sinks, toilets, and small cracks in walls."
1,DO NOT BUY! Failed within 1 week!,"Would give this zero stars if I could. Installed this product to seal the gap between a bathtub and wall surround on a super clean (new) surface. Spent a lot of time making sure the sealant bead was applied perfectly evenly and smooth and then waited at least 24 h before using the bathtub (as per manufacturer's instructions). One week later, the sealant surface is puckered up an peeling away from wall and tub. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,A Wonderful Night In Paris!,"Some refreshing arias and songs were well accepted by this music listener! However, the apparrent age is looking over Domingo's and Pavarotti's shoulders! Domingo instilled a harsh edginess with his vocals where as Carreras ,I thought, outshined them all! As for Pavarotti, well, his screeching has got to go! When he sang his first three note from Verdi's "" Luisa Miller"" most famous aria ""quando le sere al placido"", I knew that it was not Pavarotti's night! Jose Carreras sang beautifully! He may be a shade lighter in sound, but he expresses what he sings and transfers that feeling to you, the audience better than anyone in the opera world! Very Sinatra-like I would say. The medleys were well thought out and in my opinion, the best of the three concerts so far! I already have my tickets to see the Three Tenors In Concert in July of '99 in Detroit. CAN'T WAIT!"
2,Not the best tenors album.,"First of all, the change of the conductor. We were used to the thundering conducting of Mehta. Then, Pavarotti is not the same man that he was in '94 and in '90. His range fell a lot. Then, he dared to sing a song that is traditionally sang by Domingo (Granada) It lacks opera arias. Not a good purchase. Buy the first or the second albums."
2,Try another brand.,I have used and installed many home theater systems in my lifetime. These banana plugs were used on my latest install and they dont hold the speaker wires well. Definitely not a SOLID connection. Try another brand.
4,Plugs,"Nice plugs, the only downside is the method you have to fray/spread the wires and then screw the back over it just seems improvable. They do work well though and at a good price."
2,"They work, but connection is clunky","These connectors work, but the mechanism to attach the speaker cable to them is a little weird. The body comes apart. You run the speaker wire through the back end and spread the wire over the screw threads. Then you attempt to screw the body back together, over the wire. It might work with a smaller gauge wire, but with a normal gauge wire, the body won't completely screw together. I don't see how this method would work with braided wire or ribbon style speaker.I recommend buying another brand."
2,"A digest of the dead, white, and right","Lukacs' fluid writing style is this book's greatest merit. He points out a great deal of classical and modern history of outstanding merit and durability. This booklet, however, is published by the ISI's publishing house. Reading it is like being flung back into the academic culture of East Coast Universities in the 1950s. The sensation is bizarre, and horribly exclusionary. Almost any other introduction to the discipline for undergraduates would be better by showing that non-European, non-Christian stories also have merit. History is not only the study of personal and national heritage, but the trials and value of all human cultures, even those not personally relevant. The book lacks such generosity, often termed imaginative sympathy. Too bad."
2,"Short, and Disappointing","I've read and thoroughly enjoyed Margolin's seven other novels. This one -- to me, short at 292 pages less the equivalent of about 45 blank pages -- simply has an overcomplicated plot and underdeveloped characters. Sounds like a book forced out to meet a deadline. The fact that it's organized into 54 chapters -- so like 5 pages each -- gives you an idea of how choppy this story is. Plus real lawyers just don't do stuff like this. The one tactic I liked was the mini-novel of an much earlier murder (that more or less gets solved right along with our fresh one) as it diverted one from the story at hand while bringing you back to real time from out in left field. Tighten up the plot, get us better acquainted with the characters, hopefully fewer in number, and add some flesh to the story and we might have something here."
5,Another excellent story by Margolin,"Not a very long book, but one with a lot of unexpected switches; certainly among his best books. A real fast read."
4,Margolin does it again,Great book- Highly recommend it to those thriller/mystery readers out there. Margolin keeps you reading and wanting to read more. Can't wait to read his next book!
4,a good mystery read,"This is a very good read. A lawyer is defending a pharmaceutical company because he thinks they are not guilty concerning the horrible birth defects that the other side is presenting. All goes well until he finds a memo written by one of the scientists for the pharmaceutical company which seems to tell another story, and he begins an investigation for himself and therein lies the rest of the story.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,confusing,"This book is all over the place and hard to get a handle on. I think the author was trying to do too much with this. I haven't quite finished it yet, but I will because I can't put down a book this far into it. I would not, however, recommend it to anyone else."
1,Gone and Forgotten,"Margolin's latest effort is a far cry from the giants such as After Dark and Gone, But Not Forgotten. The book premise is ludicrous and does not get started. The book's plot development holds no suspense and is by far the worst of all his efforts. Usually, his books are the highlight of my summerr reading activity but this fails to generate any excitement. I wish they would find the real Philip Margolin because he certainly did not write this book. Oh!! How the mighty have fallen. This book is about 300 pages too long. Once you get past the copyright page, it is all downhill from there. This book should be Gone and Forgetten. I strongly recommend that you do not ""Associate"" yourself with this novel and wait for his next effort. Please may the real Margolin come back and replace this imposter."
2,A Major Disappointment by Margolin!,"Daniel Ames, ""the Associate,"" keeps making the same mistakes throughout the book. His character becomes maddingly annoying simply for his stupidity. Since he supposedly was bright enough to put himself through law school and be hired by one of the top-notch firms in Portland, this premise alone lacks credibility. Actually, Daniel Ames is not especially likable nor the majority of the company he keeps. While the plot has some possibilities, there are no real surprises. Hopefully, Mr. Margolin will get back to basics and his next offering will be more entertaining."
3,VERY AVERAGE STORY,"One reviewer said that if you don't read this book in one or two sittings you will forget some of the characters. Totally agree with this. Parts of this story are so easily forgotten, sadly.Daniel Ames, a blue-collar associate at a white-collar law firm, gets conned by a pretty work colleague into reviewing thousands of pages of documents. The client, a pharmaceutical company, is charged with falsifying test results on a new drug that appears to cause horrendous birth defects. Daniel is sure the company didn't do it, but among all the documents he overlooks a letter that could destroy his client's defense. The opposing counsel gets hold of it, next thing, Daniel's in the middle of a murder as well as the attendant in a legal fraud suit.This isn't Margolin's best, I preferred SLEEPING BEAUTY by Phillip Margolin"
4,Good if routine,"Margolin's latest book is an entertaining but relatively routine legal thriller. In this book - a semi-sequel to Wild Justice, as the two books share some characters - a young lawyer gets entangled in a high-stakes lawsuit over a medication that may or may not cause birth defects. People start getting murdered and the lawyer winds up as a suspect.The book has a good amount of suspense and plot twists, but it suffers from a weak main character who bounces from situation to situation without taking any real action of his own. He is a nice enough guy, but he rarely takes any initiative.For Margolin fans, this novel is good, but not great. People who are newer to the genre might be more entertained, but others will find that this story is nothing special."
4,A Fast and Enjoyable Read,"As with most of Philip Margolin's novels, there is nothing fancy about ""The Associate"". This is simply a very readable, thoroughly entertaining, and hard-to-put down legal thriller. What ""The Associate"" lacks in believable or deeply developed characters or setting, it makes up for with a quickly moving and multi-threaded plot that is sure to hold one's attention. A series of parallel story lines and plot twists fuse together in a conclusion that while mostly predictable, is still well worth the journey. All in all, ""The Associate is traditional Margolin fare: a clever and well conceived story line that while ultimately forgettable, is lots of fun while it lasts."
2,What a disappointment!,"I usually love Phillip Margolin's books and was so excited when I saw he had a new one but I was very disappointed upon reading this one. I think he may have written it a long time ago and resurrected it once he became famous. The dialogue is stilted and at times downright embarrassing, the plot is ridculously intricate for no good reason and the ultimate outcome is so obvious it makes you feel like you've wasted your time. I miss the old Mr. Margolin of ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"" and most recently ""Wild Justice"" - I hope he returns to that kind of quality writing soon!"
2,Typical and tired...,"There is nothing fresh or particularly imaginative about this legal thriller. At it's best, it is a cookie-cutter novel, without any of the drama or suspense that the top authors in this genre (Grisham, Ellis, Lashner) weave so beautifully throughout their work. At it's worst, it relies on predictable plot twists that move this tepid novel along barely fast enough to keep the reader from putting it down for good. If you suffer from insomnia, then give this book a try. Otherwise, leave it aone."
2,Not Satisfying,"I rate this novel somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. There are some nice plot twists, but overall the story is a disappointment. Without revealing plot, I can only say that the ""bad guys"" are a disappointment and not really that menacing or believable. The main character also makes some silly mistakes that make you crazy as it is obvious what is he is walking into. The best characterization lies in the female investigator who helps sort out what is going on. If you are in to lawyer suspense, I recommend you skip this one and go on to other novels this auther has written (or finish all of your Baldacci reads first...)."
4,"Intriguing, entertaining - a good read","This was a really good book, one that keeps you guessing from the beginning. I found myself running through some scenarios to try and figure out my best guess to what was going on, and was completely surprised with the ending. Being about a pharmaceutical company, this book is loaded with medical terminology and is pretty much on the mark in some rather complex principles. There were TONS of characters in this one, maybe a few too many. I had to keep up with who was doing what, who was on who's side, and who worked for which outfit. This only adds to the mystery of the novel, and, overall, I was really impressed with this one. I'll be reading more of Mr Margolin's works!"
1,VERY disappointed Margolin fan,"After reading and loving the far superior ""Undertaker's Widow"" I was excited to get an opportunity to read another of Margolin's fast paced legal thrillers. Maybe I was hoping for another plot which places a highly ethical character in a morally ambiguous situation, but what I was treated to instead was an implausible scenario which is made even worse by the actions of the main character which defy common sense. Unlike other Margolin novels, this novel is full of flaws from the main character's reactions and actions that reach new heights in stupidity to the very contrived conclusion that wrapped everything up a little too neatly. Save some time and money and read any of Margolin's other efforts, and I promise you you will leave with a better impression of someone I believe to be a very talented writer."
3,Plot device not so clever,"I read Margolin's preface, where he credits his wife for coming up with the ""plot device that drives the book"". While I enjoyed this book, I also figured out the ""device"" really quickly. It's a good, diversionary read, and the characters are interesting even if you can see exactly what is going to happen. Amanda Jaffe has a small role."
2,A Disssapointed First Timer,"This is the first book I read by Phillip Margolin. The book started-out well - and I liked the plot of Daniel Ames, small time boy making it in big time law. About 120 pages in things started to get confused for me. Maybe am slow to catch on, but I got confused with all the characters and confusing plot line. The end came together for me - for cut out the middle 75 pages."
2,Only buy this book if you are used to reading highly academic pieces,"This book was very hard to read. Both authors use an unnecessary high vocabulary and technical terms that make for very difficult reading. I did read the entire book during a long flight but it was not enjoyable reading, and I read lots of psychotherapy books and usually enjoy them. When I was finished reading it, I didn't take away anything useful for my practice."
5,I cannot stop thinking about JETTY MAN.,"Jetty Man is a book I found hard to put down. The story contains down-to earth characters who face horrid real-life situations. It is a story of trials and tribulations and pits good against evil. For those who have experienced growing up in a small ""back-roads"" Southern town, where worldliness was little known and where kindness sometimes was mistaken for weakness, this story will be one you can relate to. It is a story that touched my heart in numerous ways and left me continuously thinking about it long after I had finished reading it."
5,THIS BOOK WAS WONDERFUL.,MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH READ THIS BOOK. I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL READERS AND NON-READERS. CAN'T WAIT UNTIL WE GET MULLET RUN.
4,Works great,"Got a sample of this at Sephora. Dawn dishwashing liquid removes oil from skin as well as dishes, so my hands had become very dry and rough. The tips of my fingers were the worse. I could tell a big difference after only one treatment. A little goes a long way. Will buy more when sample runs out. I don't notice any strong smell."
2,"OK, expensive for what it does","I can get the same results using commercial moisturizers - Cetaphil, Aquaphor, Euricin. Applies evenly like Cetaphil but leaves skin greasy to the touch minutes later. W-a-y to expensive for what it does. Also, leaves slight camphor smell."
5,The BEST moisturizer I have EVER tried in my 51 years!,"I have dry skin, and i've tried almost every commercial moisturizer there is over the decades. My requirements are threefold: 1) should be natural, with no artificial or chemical based toxic ingredients; 2) should not feel greasy after application; 3) should work well on various parts of my body, including hard, dried out elbow, knee, and heel patches. I am happy to say that Yu-Be passes with 'flying colors' on all 3 counts! I-Be very Hap-py with Yu-Be!"
5,"Bye bye, luxury brands. This $24 cream blows you out of the water","I could retire on the money I've spent over the years on high-end moisturizers. I've tried them all -- La Prairie, La Mer, Sisley. It turns out this $24 jar of cream is it. I purchased it as a hand cream, tried it on my face one day and never looked back. Just buy it, you won't be sorry. Thank you, Japan!"
5,Works well for my baby's eczema,"I have tried at least a dozen different products to use on my baby, who has mild to moderate eczema. This product hasn't ""cured"" it, but it has been the only product I've tried that shows results. When she has a flare up, I'll apply this on her hot spots, and after about 2-3 days, the flare up has cleared. I much prefer this over using a steroid creme. The creme is completely scent free. Every baby with eczema seems to respond to different products differently, so for my baby, this is the one reliable one that I'll continue to invest in."
4,it's cool,"Initially I didn't care for the medicinal smell, but you get used to it and the smell dies down a while after use. My cuticles look and feel much better."
3,Not so great,This product is a good moisturizer for hands but has a powerful scent when first put on like moth balls. Itried using it on my face and found it too sticky for facial use.
4,Very moisturizing BUT,This is very moisturizing and obviously is ideal for those with severely dry cracked skin. I used this and I did see a difference but the scent is intolerable. It's camphor. I eat nonwestern foods and I still had trouble with this. You just don't want to use a cream that smells that bad. Moisturizers are supposed to smell good at least in my planet.
2,Too sticky when applyed on face...,"This product, as I said in the title. It's a little sticky, not easy to apply evenly on face...but it works well as a moisture."
3,"Ehhhh, not a favorite in our home","I love LeapFrog products. The LeapStart table and Drum were hits in our home, as are the Fridge Phonics. However, this one just doesn't have that much to it! The lights action is very basic (think leds - very 70's) and leaves much to be desired. In addition to that, the letters aren't very clear - V, B, G, Z... all sound like they are making the same noise.My son hasn't shown much interest in the item, either. He will play with it for a minute or two and then that's it.I would have given it less than 3 stars if it were not durable. That is IS. But fun? Don't think so!"
3,Does this strap to the back of one of the front seats?,"Does this strap to the back of one of the front seats?Do the vibrations from your child get transmited to your front seat, and if so is it annoying and distracting to your driving?"
5,Great Toy!,I really love this toy! It keep my kids happy forever! They have fun driving and learing all the neat things it has to offer. They don't get board with it. It is a great car toy as well. It keeps them busy and keeps me happy!
5,The best funk album available to date,"This is a very underrated album - FACT. It's a recording of Curtis playing live in 1972 (or earlier) at ""The Bitter End"", a well known club in New York. What I like best about the album is the dialogue with Curtis to the audience. It makes you feel as if you are actually there! He really does have a clear head with how the world should be, and how people could be if they tried. He does a great version of the Carpenter's song ""we've only just begun"". He shows his true colours (black) through the song ""move 'em on up"". I still find Curtis's accident to be one of the most tragic things that has ever happened. Ironically, I believe that he is and always was one of those people who appreciated every sun-rise & sun-set, and who felt as if he had to write songs about how beautiful life really is if you see it in the right light. After every time I listen to this album I feel cleansed. (comments from a non-religious person)"
1,This film irritated the hell out of me.,"I watched this film with a University German class over 30 years ago. We suffered through it in silence until Herr R. ran amok, at which point everyone cheered. At last something was happening! Herr R. is a miserable man with a miserable life, and I feel for him, but murder and suicide as an existential statement in response to profound boredom is silly. It annoyed me then, and it annoys me now. This is NOT a great film, but a pretentious,posturing waste of time."
5,Next Day Gourmet Deville Flatware,"This is very good silverware and perfect for everyday use. We had bought some pieces of the ""Next Day Gourmet Deville Flatware"" and just needed the teaspoons and now our collection is complete. I would recommend this silverware to anyone looking for a silverware set that will hold up to everyday use, it is fairly heavy for balanced use and the pieces are dishwasher safe."
2,Nice idea... not well made,"I like that the truck is wood. It has a nice, substantial feel to it. But a lot of shortcuts were taken, and therefore for the price I'm not that happy with it. For example, the ladder is really just set on top-- there is a small wooden plug that tries to hold it in place, but if you carry the truck across the room, the ladder just falls to the floor. A little bit of hardware would have secured it to the truck, but they didn't bother. Also, the 4 ""helping hero"" figures are sold separately, bringing the cost of truck + firefighters to $45. I don't think I got a lot of value for the money."
3,Great truck but falls apart quickly,"I bought this truck for my 2 yr old son who loved it. It is a great basic fire truck with ladder and hose. However, even though my son is fairly careful with things, the pieces of this truck started falling off quickly. I have had to glue back on almost every piece. The only things that have not fallen off yet are the wheels and I am kind of waiting for those to go as well. Too bad, if the parts had been fastened more securely I would love this truck."
3,Nice for budding scientists,"My son got this for his 7th birthday. He loves everything having to do with science. There are a few different ways you can configure the components of the weather station - including temperature, wind direction, wind speed, rain gauge, etc. - but we have yet to find a way to connect EVERYTHING at the same time. It would be perfect if there was a way to attach all the devices at once. Also, the instructions state there are 7 connectors but there were only 6 in the plastic package."
1,Future Scientist's Mom,I was so excited to purchase this only to be totally disappointed with the quality. The pieces would not stay together. The unit toppled over when we tried to set it outside to gather rain. Definitely bumbed us out!
1,Awful,When I was using this at the begining I thought it was pretty good.When I looked inside the box there were no instructions!I don't think you should waste your'e money on this piece of junk.
1,Not worth it,We gave this as a present to a child who is very into weather. It came in a ton of small peices and was so much smaller than we expected. It just wasn't worth it.
2,not so great,It really did do pretty well but the instructions were hidden.Ijust couldn't believe why they did it!but if your looking at this toy DON'T GET IT!
1,Agreed - a waste of money,"I agree with Daniel - this video is a waste. And so was the money I wasted on the arc barrel. The video is exactly as reviewed - a tutorial for trainers and not useful for the home Pilates enthusiast. Moreover it is not a ""workout"" but a documentary as Moira takes her students through a short variety of stretches. I could not accurately adjust myself on the barrel at home, or I kept sliding off of it. Moreover, Moira shows most exercises on one side only.The barrel itself was a waste of money. I can't find any trustworthy resources to help me utilize it and it sits around the house. I can't even unload it for 1/25 of what I paid for it!! My husband calls it ""The Hump."" The most activity I get from it is moving it to vacuum."
5,Nice!,"This was a nice video to watch, but not one of my favorites by the Williams Brothers, but it was really nice to see the Quartet groups come together and make this video. I was still blessed by some of the songs on the tape."
3,"Great photos, bad design","The books contains numerous great photos, but the design of the book brings down the overall impression. First of all, the format is unusual, unattractive and cumbersome. Too small to be a coffee table book, too tall for many bookshelves.Additionally, the fact that the captions (and explanations) are all found in the back of the book is a huge error. When browsing the images one has to continually switch back and forth between image page and caption page. I also agree with a previous reviewer that the fact that so many images have no information/file available is a huge loss. The quality of the image material is,however, beyond comparison. Very impressive and interesting photos indeed."
1,Please don't waste your money,"Bought 3 complete systems for a museum, plus an additional 3 vcr recorders (at $600 each!). It, as you would imagine, took a long time to set up and wire properly for the 12 locations we wanted monitored. It worked pretty good. Wasn't too sharp but we could see what was going on where. The monitor quality started to fade after just a couple weeks and all they had all died within a few months. Replaced all the monitors and then the cameras started going. Spent thousands keeping it working over the next couple of years. Gave up and bought a ""real"" system from a security company. No troubles. By the way, the picture shows you can see all four views at once on each monitor - you can't. It flips from one to another but only one camera view at a time. Also bought the same replacement systems at Home Depot. They had different nameplates but were all the same junk. Really, really a bad experience."
5,Have we lost something?,"Modern man has lost the knowlage of the spirit world. But not all of us. This is the true story of a Canadian Native Trapper and Medicine man who comes to know Jesus. But he is not your ordanary man for he KNOWS that there are spirits all around us and he knows what they are all about. Yet he does not know the greatest spirit of them all. At least not at first. Walk with him as he tends his trapline and watch as he learns about Jesus. Then be amazed as his simple faith changes the life of seasoned christians. Dare to belive as he discribes the spirit world around us and your life will never be the same again. ""For we battle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers"". How can we win a war against an enamy we don't even know exists? So learn about this enamy and put on the Whole Armor Of God. This is a book that every serious christian should read."
3,Adequate information for children to use,"The book was less informative than the title suggested. It was far from complete in its description of butterfly behavior, planting for butterfly gardens and in butterfly identification; however, I found the 2 pages on caterpillar identification very informative. Overall, for very basic knowledge, the book was helpful and would probably be enjoyed more by children. Children would especially like of the number of large photos. Also unlike what the title may suggest, the book read more like a magazine in length which may appeal to children more, too. The book is an easy read and can be completed cover to cover in under an hour. This book is for you if you have only a basic knowledge of butterflies and want a simple, easy to read reference. If you're looking for a substantial reference book, you may want to look elsewhere."
4,butterfly gardens,"While visiting the Butterfly Garden exhibit in Boston's Science Museum, we asked a person in charge which book he recommended for growing one's own butterfly garden (my son lives in Framingham, MA). The answer was Stokes, and he wrote it down for us. The museum does not sell it.The number of butterflies identified is smaller than some guides, but the details about their preferred plants are very good. Since I bought the book for my son (I live in California), I cannot provide more details except that he and his wife are very happy with it."
4,"Great, but limited","Yes, this is a good ""beginner"" book, but falls short on the amount of butterflies that are around. I have enjoyed learning from this book. It does have lots of garden ideas to attact butterflies. In general, it's a great beginner book. JT"
3,Soothing Background music,I use Dolfins for meditation or just background sound in my classes...I find it vert soothing.
4,Delarue at His Best,"This is a beautifully performed collection. It represents Delarue at his best, doing what he does best... fine playing, inspired interpretation and it doesn't sound shallow or thin. I first heard this while getting a massage at a spa here in Santa Fe and I immediately bought it. Highly recommend this if you need to de-stress yourself."
1,Do not be misled... this is not the famous Goa Mix!,"Do not be misled... this is NOT the famous Goa Mix by Paul Oakenfold that is widely rated to be best dance music mix of all time!I haven't rated this CD because I haven't heard it, so I won't comment on it... it might be good. I've given it 1 star, because amazon forced me to choose stars."
1,What on earth is this rubbish?,"I have read books on history, I have read books on UFOs.This is neither, because it barely even qualifies as a ""book."" It is rather a string of sourceless internet posts and sensationalist articles that would should make its author feel quite ashamed. Did he stick this together in a single afternoon?"
3,UFO History Doesn't Start Here,"The author of the book seems to have started out with a more or less honourable idea: to cram as many UFO-related incidents as possible into the shortest possible space. As a UFO researcher myself I appreciate Rife's effort to deal with material that most researchers don't usually bother with. However, the final product is a book filled with incidents that the author has done nothing to investigate independently, contains various factual errors, and whose bibliography is unacceptably vague. Many of the cases 'discussed' are taken from sources that not even Rife can identify, and when a source is given he very often casually writes ""Internet posting"" as if this counts as a bibliographical reference.As a researcher myself I may consult Rife's book from time to time 'just in case', but it does nothing to fill in gaps in the history of UFOs that other researchers such as Jerome Clark and Chris Aubeck are filling with their work."
3,Too Much Delay Between Money Shots,"I am a fan of H. G. Lewis, but I have to admit that this movie is a little too slow to develop. Of course, by ""develop,"" I do not mean any semblance of plot, but getting the viewer to the highly celebrated ""gore"" scenes. I know that whatever plot exists is just a means to an end, but this one seems to really drag. Compare it to the transitions in ""Blood Feast"" where the menacing Mr. Ramses is alone worth the price of admission, or ""Two Thousand Maniacs"" where overacting (if you can call it acting) is so astounding that it takes a few viewings just to take it all in.In short, it is a good flick, but Lewis did better."
2,Not up to the hype,"I thought this was going to be a lot better than it actually was. Maybe i'm just jaded, but i could not believe the effects for a second, and the acting was terrible. I know this is supposed to be in the category of ""so bad it's good"" but maybe with a commentary track by Mike Nelson (Mystery Science Theater 3000) it would be worth owning. Other than that, i found it just boring."
2,Wizard of Snore,"Back in the 70's/early 80's, Herschell Gordon Lewis made a slew of splatter films that were weak on plot and acting, but compensating with practically vomit inducing scenes of bodily carnage. Wizard of Gore is one of the weakest of the lot. Even though all of HGL's movies look pathetically cheesy by today's standards, Wizard suffers from blah grossout scenes and way too much filler material between them. It's the type of movie where your finger's on the fast forward button for 7/8ths of the flick. A great intro to HGL's films is the impressive 2000 Maniacs, which combines original death scenes along with some sharp black humor. Wizard is just drab in all aspects."
3,SILLY GORE - A - RAMA......,"I don't know why I watched this ridiculous ""gore"" spectacle from the 60's but I did. Herschel Gordon Lewis was never my idea of a horror film director anyway. But in this one I saw his tongue firmly planted in cheek. It's so funny and the acting so hammy you can't possibly be offended by it. Montag the Magnificent performs stage illusions where women from the audience are hypnotized as they're gored on stage. The trick is they seem perfectly fine afterward, seemingly unaware of what happened. Then later their guts fall out in restaurants or they end up dead---mutilated as they were on stage. A nosy ""Hints For Women"" type TV personality sets out to uncover the truth. The ending is WAY out there---what's illusion, what's reality and to whom?The ""gore"" is so ludicrous you know it's fake and the film so cheesy it's laughable. And the acting couldn't be any worse. See this if you're game---but remember, it's all an ""illusion""!"
1,crappy movie,"just don't like it, i like horror, but this was just stupid, blood and guts but not entertaining, will sell soon..."
5,Seems good,"I started to make my own food for my dog and wanted to make sure he was getting the necessary nutrients. This stuff seems to do the trick. I'm not sure if it is due to using this or just because I started feeding him better quality food compared to store bought dog food, but his coat is shiny and he seems pretty healthy.On a side note, this stuff is kind of stinky (smells like goldfish food) but my dog seems to like it without needing to try and ""cover it up."""
3,works good,"works good but you have to intalled the drivers right, and everytime you use it on another set up you have to reinstall the thing, but its a cheap IO and thats all I needed"
2,SOUND NOT GOOD,This is definitely a budget item. If you want a good sound card please spend more money. The sound is very pour..
1,Horrible compatability issues,"As most have written, this is basicaly an amazing device IF you can get it to work. If your system has any issue recognizing the device, then forget it. I have tried this unit on 3 laptops and 2 desktops with 3 different versions of Windows. None of them could get this device to work. Sending it back unfortunately."
3,Works!,"I bought this to use for my son's Numark MIXTRACK PRO, and come to find out you don't really need it. All the ports needed to run a mic and speakers are already installed on the Mixtrack Pro so there's no need for this item. He may need it down the road."
2,Error,I tried installing the DJ I/O and all it tells me is that it did not install (Error: 0x0007) at the end of the set up. Absolutely does not tell me why. Can someone please explain to me why?
3,If you can get it working....,It works well... but had to uninstall and reinstall the driver about 5 times before it started working. Also the control panel sometimes does not detect the device even though it is plugged in. Especially after a reboot. Unplug and replug the device to fix that.Sometimes the latency is messed up. This will take a full uninstall of drivers. Cold boot to reinstall. Cold boot and unplug/replug to get rid of.This is a perfect case of the same sickness CreativeLabs sound cards have: Great hardware but poor poor drivers.
3,Its a good item for a beginner/learner,"Since I'm a new bee to Dj'ing, this was the ideal, worth the buck product. I took some time to set it up since I needed a longer jack to connect my normal headphones to the headphone jack of the DJI/O and also accquire RCA cable for the sound.I wanted to know all that was required for the product to work seemlessly since this gadget was aimed at people who are new to this. Since I didn't pre-purchase the needed wires before the shipment arrived, I was disappointed once I tried to set it up. It ended up in my closet for a month or so till I figured out what all I needed to get from the store.But now that its all set, its amazing... Sound is crisp and I also advise people not to go cheap on wires and connectors (as quality matters).Go for it!"
4,Numark DJ I/O,"Perfect for the price, works very well with the Numark Mixtrack, easy to use and install, very happy with this product"
5,Great sound card!!!,Sound card was a great purchase. I've had problems with imitation cards and my DJing software. I haven't had any issues with this card yet! Software runs smoother and hasn't crashed yet. I recommend this card to anyone that needs one. It's a great sound card at a reasonable price.
4,Excellent service!,"Brand new, fast shipping, what else can I ask for! Amazon gives a great service & Numark provides quality.HI-FI sound & great performance for live audio mixing."
4,Can't go wrong,"Gotta Love it! Can't go wrong on this ASIO usb device from Numark. Works great, great service, can't really say much more. Just wish they'd come up with an ASIO Mixer Board that's not plastic and costs 200 bucks."
5,i use it with the mixtrack,this thing is cool man it works great with the numark mixtrack i bought it and set it up and works great with the dj io you can cue up a song while the other deck is playing i love this thin it has an input for headphones and a microphone and rca ouputs so u can conect it to a amplifier or powered speakers
2,Numark DJ I/O,It's decent when it wants to be. The software (driver) acts up every now and then and I have to re-install it.If you can afford this I recommend saving just a little more and getting something else.Only thing I see that it's good for is the fact that it has a separate headphone jack. And even then you have to configure your software (youtube) to learn how to go about doing that.
5,Hits the spot,"My DJing needs were pretty minimal; I wanted to use PC software to mix outputs via an external source. The DJ I/O filled that need perfectly. This box is relatively inexpensive, it's compact and I found it very easy to install and use with open source mixing software."
3,Works Good...When It Works,"I bought this a week before I switched to Windows 7. I was using it on Windows Vista Business 64bit and it worked great along with Traktor Pro, however, it doesn't seem to like Windows 7 at all. This could just be a Traktor problem, but all my drivers are up to date and such. When it did work, the sound quality was amazing. I reformatted last night to Windows 7 64bit and have yet to try it out, but I hope it works better than it did on 32bit. If you can it to work, then it is a great product that I would highly recommend. I have many friends that use this, and the week I did have it working it was amazing."
2,"Admit it, Amazon, it's (just) noise.","One would be hard-pressed to find music farther from the mainstream (however, see ""Miss Murgatroid"") than this ""alternative industrial"", which I deny to be either an apt or honest description. I listened in headphones for the anticipated full effect; to play this on a stereo even a tick above minimum volume would earn a sure citation and scare the living daylights out of anyone of physical or emotional propinquity. I must take issue with the 5-star ""classic"" ratings, given the rather narrow audience. I like freeform just as much if not considerably more than ""the next"" guy, but I do not enjoy the sensation of blood trickling out of my ears. In the end, I wonder why I listened to this, and I do not think I will seek any more. I think I do see the ""art"" of this noise, but I cannot appreciate it. The initially daunting but ultimately (and comparatively) slight 51 minutes will leave the nonetheless exhausted listener ranting, ""IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?!"""
2,Poor transmitters,"The Quality of transmitting is poor, and I cant get these things to give a clear picture."
4,"great stuff, wish flavors more equal","I LOVE the bubblegum flavor of Chap-Et and hoped I'd get at least 10 of that flavor in the tub. Well, not quite. My breakdown was:Cherry 20Vanilla 11Plain 7Bubblegum 6Mint 4At least I didn't get 10 mint and 2 bubblegum like the other reviewer! Having seen that I don't know if I'll ever risk another purchase of the tub. I'd totally give Chap-Et 5 stars if I could just buy the flavor I want."
5,Chapet Meets Goldilock's Expectations,I first discovered Chapet in my local grocery store over five years ago. I was an instant convert. Bye-bye Chapstick and Blistex. The first was too waxy. The second tasted medicinal. Chapet suits this Goldilocks. It is just right. Since my store stopped selling Chapet several years ago I was thrilled to find an affordable resource of Chapet.
3,Chapet review,"My Chap-et just arrived. It smells really good, the texture is smooth and nice. I bought it for kids, so that is a great thing to have 5 different flavors.However, I only gave it 3 stars because it had some issues.First, I only recieved 47 instead of 48.Secondly. One of them, a bubblegum flavor was shrinkwrapped without a lid. Well, it was good for a laugh.Would I buy it again? Probably, since the value still seems good. But then again, maybe not."
5,Best lip balm/conditioner ever!!!,My wife and I are big fans of Chapet! If we have a choice we will use no other brands. I purchased the tub of tubes for a Christmas gift for my wife and she was tickled to death with it. Great product!!!
1,Huge disappointment,"I have spent the last two nights watching this series on Star TV(it's on for five nights}and I am greatly disappointed. A bunch of old codgers reminiscing about when the Beatles were in their mid teens. A couple of them were in the Quarrymen.One fellow ,their first manager,seems more interested in tooting his own horn rather than getting to more intesting facts about the Beatles. In the first two segments there has been very little footage of the Beatles and I have a feeling the series will continue in this manner, I hope not. I will continue through the next three segments because I am curious but I cannot imagine forking over the cash to buy this box set."
3,Ok but not a Radio Flyer!,You get what you pay for. I didn't want to spend double the money for the brand name so I got half the product. Quality that is. I think the wagon will do the job for carting around my kids but it's definitely not a Radio Flyer. If I had to do it again I would probably go the same way as I'm sure it will still hold up. I'll let you know in the summer.
1,Read if you want to be bored!,"When I saw this title, I thought, WOW! However, once I started reading, I realized I had made a mistake. It took me three weeks to read (do to falling asleep from the constant droning of the author). If you can avoid reading this, good for you. If you want to read about detectives, realize that this profession is mostly dull (this is from experience) and spend your money on something else."
2,The guy is a jerk,"...With his vacuous babble, snarky cockyness, & outright rude demeanor. You should feel like he is having fun and enjoying the people around him. Instead he is boring and seems to dislike many of the people he meets, or they dislike him. It's unfortunate that he has the best job on the planet, since he is so hard to watch.Just watch how he treats the bartender in Glasgow who has been voted best Martini year after year. He forces the BT to make it shaken, then makes the BT drink it."
4,Unusual collection,"This collection brings together some of Jaco's recordings as a sideman. Included on this CD are ""Dreamland"" from Joni Mitchell's Don Juan' Reckless Daughter, as well as tunes recorded with Brazilian percussionist Airto and jazz multi-instrumentalist Ira Sullivan."
5,A joy,"I have both this and the Kirov version with Gergiev. The production and most of the singing are clearly superior here and only the picture quality is clearly superior with the Kirov. Given that the picture and sound on this DVD are quite acceptable this is the version to have if you only want one, and worth the purchase if you have the Kirov already. It's that enchanting."
3,Not the greatest of the IMAX titles,"I have pretty much all of the WMVHD disks (including the more obscure ones like Muffin Man and Step Into Liquid). The film transfer of this title isn't as crisp as the other IMAX titles, and in general, the cinematography is not as stunning. Still nice, but it just doesn't compare to the others. The story line is a little campy, but they do a good job of covering a lot of ground, from 1600's to the future, showing how explorers risk everything to break new ground."
2,"I ""Discovered""... not to buy this.",I didn't know there's such thing as a bad IMAX movie until I came across this.
2,A mediocre IMAX movie,"As many have said, this was not the best IMAX movie ever made.I wanted a copy for myself because I have a 10 second cameo in this movie (am I vain?). I worked on the Magellan Venus Radar Mapper project at JPL, and helped generate the images that went into the simulated flight over the surface of Venus. This was probably the only part of the whole movie worth seeing. My coworkers and I were invited to see this movie at its first public showing at the IMAX theater in LA. I was blown away by the simulated flight segment, even though I had seen it many times before in our labs. Even so, I found it difficult to spend money on this weak piece of work.With my apologies to Greg MacGillivray."
1,Lost Discoverers,"I purchased this DVD as a teaching aid. It is worthless from a pedagogical point of view. It is nothing more than a pastiche of disconnected topics. It displays none of the intelligence nor logic of Boorstein's book. It's not even very entertaining-- a colossal waste of time, money, and film."
4,an odd view of humanity,"""The City and the Stars"" is a sort of extended version of ""Against the Fall of Night"". This confused me as a young adult as I read both versions and did not, then, understand why Clarke would do both titles. ""the City and the Stars"" is the longer and more polished version and is somewhat better.I always felt that Clarke seemed to have an odd view of humanity in this novel. I never understood why he would have only one person who found it hard to live with such a long status quo. Nor am I happy as to why humankind would choose to live in a status quo.In any case, after a long status quo, one person is born who looks for a way out of that status quo and finds it.The story is a good one."
5,One of Sir Arthur's Best,I agree with the first reviewer. I've read this novel in my childhood and re-read it many times.I am very saddened by his death. It has been a great loss to humanity.
5,The best novel ever written,This novel is so awe-inspiring and yet so down-to earth simultaineously. The main character's struggles are rich in superb symbolism. The setting Clarke describes is fantastic.I wish a movie would be made.
5,You must own this book!,"Calling this ""classic"" science fiction seems like too droll of a description. This book will not let go of you once you've read the first sentence. The characters, the plot, the suspense and the reward are fantastic. It pulls you in so completely you won't even feel like you are reading -- as if you are traveling the moving ways through Diaspar itself, watching the Jester's tricks or struggling against the bonds of the City. I've picked up City and the Stars, flipped to a page in the middle and gotten instantly drawn into Alvin's story again and again and again. This is by far my favorite science fiction book ever. Buy two copies and put one in a sealed plastic bag for the time when your first, ratty and torn copy turns to dust!"
3,ok,Mostly hotels not really camping which I was looking for. But it's great for hotels if you need something for that.
4,Make sure you have correct power supply!,"After ordering here and receiving this item (from Dell Direct), I missed the fine print. But the copy above *does* say that you need a PA-10 type power supply. As received from Dell, the item came with absolutely no documentation (or even an invoice for that matter.) So here I go ordering another $25 power adapter in order to use it. I'll be back if this isn't great."
5,Why can't Dell sell them this cheap?,Works just like the expensive one from Dell. No more fumbling with the laptop in the morning or evening. Just disengage and go. Thanks
2,why cant u include the ac adapter,"and charge as needed, so i don't have to futz around trying to make sure i find the right one"
2,Nice Ring,"I was told that the wide of this ring was 3/8"" and was 1/4"" I realize about that until I received it. I didn't get what I wanted. The ring its ok."
2,concerns on kool Kooshion ventilated seat,"Comfort Products Kool Kooshion Ventilated Seat Cushion Black[...]Size is smaller that looks in the pictures; it does not cover the complete back. The illustration is not in a real scale or the chair where it is supported is smaller than a real chair.The product and the concept are ok, but unfortunately are for kids or small persons."
3,"OK, not great","Does heap keep you from getting hot, and fits into our small Miata. The back, however, does not go all the way up leaving your shoulders still against the seat.Neither helps not hinders comfort."
4,Big help for the hot weather!,"I use this in my work truck that has vinyl seats and it keeps you above the seat about 1/2 inch so air is in between. This is not made to cushion but to ventilate. I use tie wraps to connect to seat because of heavy use but in a car you might not need this.I went to Pep boys they did not have this ,amazon had it at my door in two days,Great item!"
1,Not Comfortable at all,"I was hoping this was like the old one I had 25 years ago which was comfortable. But it's not, this thing tortures you!"
1,A must to avoid,"This is not so much a review as a public health warning - this boring, unbelievable, poorly-written and -acted(??) rubbish should be avoided at, if you'll pardon the expression, gunpoint. On one of my favourite gripes; autos get hit by streetcars every day, but they don't explode in fireballs. I'd no idea that gasoline was so explosive. I think I'll give up driving.I give this DVD only one star because I can't give it any lower. In fact, this movie truly merits the Teemacs Five Black Hole Award. I'll not be seeing ""3""."
2,Why Did Hollywood Do This?,"I'll keep it short and sweet.Sniper 2 was not as good as the original and the plot was very hard to follow. Also, the premise that Master Gunnery Sergeant Beckett was the only sniper that could carry out this mission was absurd."
3,It's not the greatest,Most of the movie is about him trying to escape. The first one was better because it was about getting to the sniping destination. This one it's like they just show up there.
4,one shot two kills,if you have seen sniper? your going to want to see sniper 2. follow the best sniper the u. s. has. this is a great second movie. a lot of follow-ups of movies are very boring but i think your going to like this one. tom berenger at his best.
2,"Famous Quotes from ""Sniper 2""","Famous Quotes from ""Sniper 2"": ""We've got company!"" ""Let's finish this!"" ""Hey, that's a suicide missiion!""Look, it's still cool to see an actor at Tom Berenger's age pull off being an action lead in anything. He is the best thing about this movie.Enjoy!"
2,Sniper 2,"This is a poor second try at repeating the original ""Sniper"" movie. Poor plot, poor direction. Just another meaningless action movie."
3,To tell you the truth...,"...I don't remember ever buying this movie. Amazon sure thinks I did, though. I've seen the movie. It was okay but nothing worth running to the store for."
1,No comment,Just had an urgent need to let you know that this movie absolutely sucks. Please don't waste your time at watching this cartoon. You'll regret it if you do.
4,sexy cross,It is a beautiful piece of silver jewelry. It looks and feels sexy. Looks great on my fiance. A great buy for people into Celtic CrossesBBAmber
1,"HARMFUL TO FISH, ESPECIALLY LIVE BREEDERS","You will see as soon as you add this to your tank that your fish are experiencing a great deal of trauma. They will become frantic, then slow down, clamp their fins then settle at the bottom for awhile. If you have mollies, they are particularly sensitive to these chemicals and are likely to become very ill or die. I firmly believe this product should be pulled from the market."
5,Love Lobo's music!,Lobo's music takes me back to high school days and lots of good memories. His child and mine were in the same daycare at one time.
5,great music from the past,"this is a collection of the best of Lobo, great music, brings back a lot of memories I have had other best of but this is the very best of and it is you wont be disapointed"
3,grich,"It was OK. He had a few good hits that I heard on the radio when I was a kid and although he was a pretty good singer/songwriter, he was not one of the great ones of his era."
4,"loved it, recommend it to everybody who likes this kind of music.",I already had this in an album and couldn't find it and was very glad to find it again in a cd. Love this kind of music and was not disappointed in the cd at all. Would recommend it to anyone. And the service I got was great when I ordered it. Got it very fast.
3,Missing Rings,"This is a great compilation with one MAJOR flaw: it does not include one of my favorite Lobo songs of all time ""Rings."" If you are looking for a greatest hits with Rings, the only one to get is the Rhino collection. I wish I had paid more attention when ordering this disc. I am very disappointed that Rings is missing. :("
3,Good Collection but missing a couple of hits!,"A previous reviewer claimed this to be the most complete collection with ALL the hits.Wrong.It's missing his last big hit ""Where Were You When I Was Falling in Love?"" ( #1 AC, 1979 ) and the follow-up ""Holding On For Dear Love"".There still isn't a domestic release that fully covers Lobo's hits."
3,Polite warning!,"My favorite song of his was, Don't Expect Me To Be Your Friend. If you are looking for the exact recording that was heard on the radio back then....this is not it. On the record, The Best of Lobo (Blue Cover) that is the original. As for the others I don't know but one of the other reviewers eluded to that more bluntly!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,[...].THIS IS RE-RECORDED CRAP.Don't throw away your hard-earned money on this worthless CD.
3,Get what ya pay for...,Gave as a gift to my fiance for Christmas. Its costume jewelry so I didnt expect much. She liked it but it took them a while to ship. Almost 3 weeks delivery.
1,needs a base plate,"recently changed out motherboard on dell 518 with a asus board just an upgrade original board still good.No base plate,hp to dell has different threads.couldnt use.Not a good enough description.add the baseplate!"
4,WWF Road to wrestlemania,"Hey, folks! this game rocks!I personally love the tag matches being Undertaker & Kane. There's no alliance on the game, but there are 23 wrestlers and super kool graphics. The entrances are like on the smackdowns- they take up the full screen, but are the quality of live tv. There are 4 rings- RAW, Smackdown,KOTR and wrestlemania.This is written by the coolest guy in the uk.damn, probably the world as well."
5,WRESTLING RULES!,"I haven't even played it and I know it's going to be good. I'm a HUGE wrestling fan. In my opinion of what I saw, this game has better graphics than WWF Warzone and WWF Attitude for N64!"
1,Terrible game,"The gameplay in this game is the worst I have ever experienced. Be smart and save your money. It is impossible to execute moves or even punches and kicks on this horrendous game. In addition to the atrocious gameplay, the graphics and sounds are really 2nd rate. They are no better than anything available on Gameboy Color. Come on WWF! Make a GBA game worth playing!!"
4,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"This game sucks compared to Road to Wrestlemania X8, which in turn, is still not as Fire Pro Wrestling. I found out the hard way by buying this after I bought Road to Wrestlemania X8. Please do not waste your money."
3,As the Rock fades away,"This game is sort of fun, but it yet sort of dull. It can get quite boring at some point in the game. It is the same thing as all the other wwf games. You are also almost the same people from all of the other games. I only give it three stars, the middle. It can be fun yet boring. I honestly would only recommend it to really big wrestling fans."
1,No!!!,"Fun!??! 5 stars!?!? that means these people havent obviously played Fire Pro Wrestling. Lets check the differences:r2Wrestlemania: Fire Pro Wrestling:24 superstars 150 superstars include WWE,WCW,ECWcage cage,deathmatchsame moves for everyone thousandas of different movesonly different for finishers amazingcool entrances decent entrances5 different rings about a dozen different ringsand 5 different arenasfew decent modes tons of different modesable to choose wrestlers able to make wrestlers and leaguesshould i do more?"
4,Boxer research,I am trying to learn all that I can about the Boxer rebellion because my grandfather was one of the marines trapped there in the embassy compound. My goal is to write a book about him and his experiences.
2,I can't believe Pete let this package go out *as is*,"Quadrophenia DVD is great--spot on as I remember seeing it on consecutive nights in 1997. Little too much with the film taking away from the bands performance, however worth the money nonetheless to have this performance alone.Tommy--unbelievable. The music overdub is out of sync with the actual performance. Makes Pete and Roger look like they are spastic dancing off beat and Pete strumming chords where they don't exist. The drums are the worse--hitting cymbals off beat to what you are seeing and fills that don't exist or are totally off. I had to turn it off. Couldn't watch such a total botch job of a great piece of music.Reminded me of watching Dick Clark's American Bandstand in the 60s where the band would horribly lip-sync over records and guitarists would play without cables leading to their amps.Pete--did you watch this production before it hit the streets? This was supposed to be LIVE concerts--who are you fooling? Anything but."
3,Awesome...but,"This live version of Tommy is the best...but, the picture and sound track were slightly out of synch. Material on DVDs are worth 5 stars, and are great to listen to. It sucks that Rhino manufactured the DVDs with out of synch sound. It's difficult to watch."
2,Got Fooled Again!,"Most likely my own fault for making an impulse purchase without researching the product prior thereto. I had no idea of the number of guest ""stars"" featured at the gigs; several of whom I had never heard of. Whoever that was (is) doing the Punk and several other Quad tunes ruined the whole thing for me. I was expecting the Who, the whole Who and nothing but the Who. Granted I assumed that Billy Idol would be featured grabbing his groin as he did at the Quad show when they first toured the album. But other than him, I just wanted the band (along with the band's supporting musicians of course). Especially regarding Tommy which is so full of guest performers that I could barely get through the whole show. Anyway, that's my beef. As far as technical quality and camera angles go, I have no comment as I couldn't bring myself to watch the DVDs more than once."
5,The Who - Tommy and Quadrophenia Live,One of the best rock shows ever caught on tape whit the greatest list of guests ever .If you don't like this one you have no sole
5,"Great music, great execution !","The music is great ! The execution is outstanding !P.S. Pity that Pete only plays acoustic guitar on stage At the time of the gigs word was out that Pete's hearing problem prevented him from playing his electric axe. He relied on another musician (the name escapes me) to play electric on stage.Anyway, this DVD is a great, great buy !!"
3,All star cast,Pretty good shows. Lots of guest stars. Have only watched once or twice. Guess I should play again soon. Fun to see Entwhistle playing.
1,Where's the bass?????????,"In both performances, the mix has rendered John Entwistle's bass inaudible. It sucks. The only place you can hear it is during the solos in Underture from Tommy and 5:15 from Quadrophenia.I saw the live performances and the bass cuts through like a 747 going overhead. It doesn't on the DVD. Infact, you wouldn't even know Entwistle's there. R.I.P., John."
2,Who fans deserve better,"Who produced the Quad DVD? It's unacceptable that a band with the caliber of The Who, releases a concerto where video and sound are out of synch. Some parts of Quad are so badly done that I gave up watching. Besides that what's the point of using video shots at a super production concert, where you can't see the stage from far away, you don't see the band as a whole, and no visual effects are shown! Maybe 95% of the concert was filmed with the cameras really close to the band members. That sucks! It's the same shots over and over again, and it looks like a cheap production kind of thing. When I read about this release I got happy, now I'm not.The Tommy video is great. The Quad video is a shame."
3,kinda dissapointed,"first of all, to reviewer ""galen"", if you're gonna slag the band, at least spell their names correctly.i love the who and was dying for this...not great but i agree that it's hard to top '30 years' 'kids' and 'albert hall'. i didn't like the ensemble thing too much, on tommy especially. but it's the who! and i love them, and this is a worthy addition to my collection.mostly, though, it made me wanna watch my boot of the '75 houston summit show, which is so fantastic, it makes all other bands and just about all other who video pale in comparison. '30 years' would probably be my second fave. why? keith moon, of course. period."
3,Who is this?,"When I bought this dvd set, I expected a similar performance to the ones seen in the Royal Albert Hall and Live in Boston Dvd's but it was totally different. They had a huge band that they used to reenact the albums. It takes away from the kind of rock performance that makes The Who great. It is one thing for Brian Wilson to do something like that, but I found that the songs just fell short. And Pete Townshend has a ridiculous looking pony tail."
3,Very good documentary,This documentary just shows that people are the same every where you go. There are drug addicts and prostitutes in Iran just like there are crooked cops every where.
5,A Damning Indictment of Irans current Government,"This documentary video details prostitution, hard drug use and more under the Islamic Republic of Iran, which lets poor women be forced into prostitution. According to the documentary some of the women's customers are religious authorities. This is totally against the Muslim religion which not only condemns prostitution and immoral behavior, but, also emphasizes charity.It provides one example of how the Persians are suffering under their current government which is extremely hypocritical.This documentary is only suitable for mature audiences"
4,Winter Cahnce by Ron Gamer,Winter Chance was one of the best books I ever read!! It was cool when the wolf became Travis's friend. I liked how Seth was the one who found Travis instead of the search party. I would never go in the woods by myself.(...)
4,My Review,I thought the book was really adventurous. In the book there was kids around our age and that we could understand it more. Winter Chance was one of the best books I have ever read. I liked the parts when first travis saved Midnights life then at the end Midnight saved his.By Vanessa
4,Winter Chance Rocks!!!,Winter Chance is one of the best books I ever read. It is so interesting. I think you should make more of them. You should start a new series they are so good. I like that you made Travis so smart. If it was me I wouldn't have survived. I read ahead in class it was so good. I am your #1 fan.
3,My Review,I kinda liked the book! I liked it when it talked about seth. It was one of my favoite book I read. It was a good book because it was based outdoors and i kinda like the outdoors(when it is warm!?!?!?!?!?)
4,winter chance reveiw,"Winter chance was a good book. It had a good description of mystery lake, the forest and the chararcters. When you get to the next chapter it gets you excited of what will happen next.Ron Gamer is a good writer.The adventures in the book are dangerous sometimes."
3,How Good Winter Chance Was,There were some good and bad things in the book. A good thing was that it was adventurous. Another good thing was that it gave good descriptions of Travis and Seth. The only bad thing that I thought about it was that he didn't make hardcover. My overall thought of the book was that it was awesome.
3,joe vito,I liked the parts when Travis was in trouble like when he forgot the food packets. Also when the potchers found Travis and took him deed into the woods and left him for dead . When Travis fell and hurt his leg i thought he was going to die. When your new book comes out i will buy it as long it has Seth and Travis
5,*Winter Chance is addicting!*,I didn't like to read much but Winter Chance drew me right in. I love reading now. Ron Gamer coudn't have done a better job. RON RULES!
4,kids reveiw,The book was cool!I liked when he went out in the woods!It was a very intersting book!It was a good book!!
4,one of the coolest books,it was one of the best books i have ever read. it was at my ages reading level. the author came to our school and it was a really nice thing for him to do.
1,My Review,I did not like Winter Chance. It was confusing. I never want to read Winter Chance again. I didn't like it.
3,Barbara Tells a Good Story,"Barbara Barrie does a good job telling a coherent, compelling tale of her experience of colon cancer but her outright honesty about her own denial of long-term symptoms makes you want to shake her! Anyone undergoing the bodily image changes of an ostomy will identify with her embarassment and ultimate acceptance of a difficult, but liberating (it gives you your life back), adjustment."
2,"Boring, boring","Well, I guess I had a different take on this book than the other reviewers here. Having a new colostomy, I was really hoping that there would be a lot of information about that in this book. Unfortunately for me, most of the book was about her acting gigs, which I have no interest in. And there was a lot on her botched colostomy, which is really awful but again, not something I'm dealing with. Her attitude is wonderful, and I can't even imagine how she could have chemotherapy and then work the same day. I truly admire who she is. But the information I personally was hoping would be in this book (from the sound of the title) just wasn't there."
5,Works great for me,"I purchased this product from a competitor and have had it for about 4 years connected to my Dish Network box in the basement to transmit to my TV in my bedroom (directly above). The only time I've had the display problems mentioned by others is when the coax cable has worked loose when we've moved furniture or TV's. When I tighten the cable connection, video issues are gone. I love it."
5,A very interesting book,"This book really goes behind the scenes in the NBA. While Keteyian and Co. certainly don't pull any punches, it might have been nice to see some of the positive things in the NBA discussed. But I guess sensational news is what sells and this book has no shortage of it. The authors talk about David Stern, Michael Jordan's gambling and the murder of his father, the drugs and gambling problems that plague many players, and also about how Joe Smith and his family coped with NBA life. I was really shocked to see how deep the problems with gambling and drugs go. If you are an NBA fan, definitely read this."
5,This is so much fun!!!,"I bought this for my 5 year old grandson, he is VERY active and I thought it would be a good way to burn up some of that extra energy! Not only does he love it, but so does his 2 year old sister. My daughter tells me that they both dance and dance, until they fall down laughing. This was certainly a good buy!"
2,disappointing,"It says that it works with vibration, maybe if you are dancing on a trampoline. The kids are not really that impressed."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"Our boat cover is three years old and had developed a couple of soft spots where water would seep through when it rained. We put the Starbrite solution into a regular hand spray bottle and with the cover on the boat, we sprayed a layer over the whole thing. That was on Sunday afternoon and of course, on Wednesday and Thursday we had torrential rains, so when we went to the boat Friday evening, we expected to see some of the usual water inside. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NONE!!! The cover is now completely waterproof again and even more surprising, it's as soft as the day we bought it!This is a truly fantastic product and we'll be using it to treat our cover every year from now on!"
3,boat cover treatment,"First, even after following the directions, it did not cover the square area claimed. You will need 30% morethan it claims. I cannot comment on how it performs as it has not rained yet. Amazon fept bugging me to review, so here it is."
3,Okay,Seemed to work ok. Expensive for the amount you get. I found out WD-40 would work as well and is cheaper.
1,Would love to try it out!,"Ordered the first one and it was undeliverable, I figured it must have been damaged in shipping, Amazon resent, 2nd one arrived and top was busted and it almost all leaked out, Amazon shipped another this one arrived the day we left for camping so I threw it in the car to spray the tent when we set it up only to find the spray nozzle not working and 1/3 of the bottle leaked out in shipping again due to poor packaging AGAIN!"
3,A little creative idea that comes in small size,"These slipers are too small to fit American feet. I liked the idea and bought two pairs, but my feet can't get in. I'm just averyge sided at 5'9"" and weigh 150 lb."
4,Did the job but required a LOT of product,I ordered the small container with attached sprayer. Spraying a very small 12' boat cover I ran out after 2/3rds of the cover was sprayed and had to order another container.It is easy to apply and seems to be doing the job - even without all their recommended cleaning.
1,Not going to purchase again,"Intended use was to waterproof horse blankets. I waterproofed the same blankets last year with a different product and all went well. Washed and dried blankets, then applied this product following all the directions. It seemed to be OK since water beaded up on the surface. But the first week out with the blankets on and I have cold wet horses, had to pull the blankets and put on lighter sheets that had been waterproofed LAST year with the old product. The rain went all the way through and it wasn't even a heavy rain."
3,"Good, not great.","Transition deliver 11 tracks of catchy, paint-by-numbers punk pop on their debut release Get There on Floodgate Records. The album contains nothing you haven't heard a thousand times before but the music itself is well-executed. Imagine Bowling For Soup stripped of the 8th grade sense of humor but add in modern day ""emo"" pop sensibilities and you'd come close to their sound.Lyrically, the group shows their just out of high school age with your basic, overdone pop-punk themes. Each track seems ready for MTV with pristine production provided by Mike Herrera of MXPX. All in all this isn't a terrible album, they are just swimming in a sea filled with similar bands and do little to stand out. They have big hooks and good sing-a-longs and if you enjoy that sort of thing this record is up your ally.Wes Johnson - Buzzgrinder.com"
1,Total Dud,"My daughter got this for her seventh birthday, and she finds this game continually frustrating. From the very beginning, the touch of the controls needed is extremely delicate. She has no chance to explore before being dumped in the weeds. I wish there were ratings for games based on ease of use. It would have been nice had the game designers kept the truly difficult jumps and swings until a little later in the game, especially considering this game is designed for young kids. The Thornberrys are my daughters favorite cartoon family, and this game is hugely disappointing. It may be better for kids with more game experience, but if your child is just starting out, save this for another year."
2,Very poor controls.,I am very disappointed with this game. My 5 year old who is a very good gamer cannot get the controls down on this game. Neither can I and I'm a computer/video mom who's been playing since Pong came out! I can usually help him get through any tough parts on his games but not this one. I spent over an hour trying to get through the 1st level. It was ridiculous. The game is heading to the second hand shop to be traded. Booo. Hisss. Hisss.
4,an interesting book,"This is a really interesting book. The main character, Casey is evolving in the story. Keeps your attention."
1,terible auther (my opinin,abc are not i was looking for all i wanted was that i wanted to be told somthing i dont know she had some great books at first but now i try somone else
5,finding your place,"I don't have a good description. Stark and visceral, but hypnotic at the same time. A difficult but sympathetic protagonist; I cringed at each self-defeating action, but never stopped rooting for her. This book stayed with me in a way that few do."
5,Excellent Electirical Circuit Breaker Protection,We had a halogen bulb for a security light that went out and had actually fused its metal contacts (they showed signs of melting!). If it was not for this precision circuit breaker doing its job in preventing any electrical current to go to that security light we probably would have had a fire.
3,Pretty Good but not amongest Her Prime time best,Dianne Reeves has been a Favorite of Mine for a really long time&often She has been Slept on.She is finally getting some more Attention.this Album really doesn't move me like Her past Albums.it has a Flash&Polish Element that for me takes away Her rawness.Not at all Bad but I have better Albums by Her.
4,A Modern Day Legend,"What can you say about Dianne Reeves. She has the class, the voice, and the mind of what a jazz vocalist is all about. I have three of Dianne Reeves albums and they all send a messege of jazz evolution to the degree of music innovation. I recommend this album to jazz(vocalist)lovers only."
1,CD Quality 1 star-Performance 5 stars,"What a great control she has over her voice-Wow! Dianne Reeves is great especially as I heard her live recently on a business trip at Motion Blue(Blue Note) in Yokohama. The music is fantastic, and the musicians superb! BUT The recording when played on a decent audio system sucks- I can't wait to get a NON-Controlled CD copy or hopefully one day buy it on vinyl without copy control schmuck being added to it. Sorry Ms Reeves and the band, but I had to return the CD. I will just have to live with the memory of the live performance! Shame on you Blue Note for screwing up such a nice performance!!!"
4,New to her music,"Lullaby of Broadway may be the most surprising and beautiful interpretation of a song I have ever heard. I found myself listening and understanding it for the first time as poignant. Her emotional interpretation added intellectual understanding, a real attribute for a musician. Her voice is beautiful, but still real. The whole album is satisfying and a good buy for anyone who appreciates new insights into music."
3,Could have been better,"I think that this author had a lot of good information, but needed better help from an editor in organizing and presenting it.The first section is disorganized and hard to follow. It was intended to cover the ""inspirational forces"" for Art Nouveau and Art Deco jewelry (people, places, ideas, and events) but the way it was presented made the information not very valuable, at least to me.One thing I learned---while I knew that ""nouveau"" meant new, I learned that ""deco"" meant ""young.Section 2 had some wonderful color plates of pieces of jewelry and the third section had lists of designs, motifs, and materials for ""new art"" jewelry.Section 4 had ""thumbnail sketches"" of jewelers, jewelry designers/makers, manufacturers and retailers.The last section was an interesting glossary of jewelry terms and types. I especially enjoyed the information about hallmarks, enamel, combs, hatpins, and purses (mesh and beaded)."
3,Basically it is a reference book,"Small size fonts,low quality print on an acid paper. Lots of topics briefly touched with comparatively few bleak illustrations. Only 2 pages out of 388 dedicated to Heat Pump theme."
5,A thorough review of Hydro. A must have on every bookshelf.,This book rocks! Every needed formula and plenty of examples too
3,Did anyone proof read this text before it went to print?,"I have the 3rd edition which I purchased in 1995 and although I enjoy the subject matter and use this book as a reference, I am still finding errors and making corrections to the textbook (typos in both text and problem sets). Someone should have paid closer attention to detail prior to submission to the publisher. I was going to get the 4th addition to add to my personal library, hoping there would be no errors. However, after a few minutes of research on the internet I found out that there are still errors in the 4th addition. However, the author does have a webpage with corrections posted. I wouldn't recommend this text to anyone unless they have time and are willing to go through the text to make the corrections. There are other texts in print covering the same subject matter with fewer or no errors."
5,An excellent source of information for GW Hydrology,"This book is an excellent source of information, especially for those who are interested in learning the fundamental aspects of groundwater hydrology. C.W. Fetter did a fantastic job conveying both the theoretical and applied nature of groundwater hydrology. The first several chapters, which discuss soil/rock properties and general surface hydrology are helpful if one needs a quick refresher. Derivations of important equations (i.e. Darcy's Law, Radial Flow, Well Hydraulics, etc.) are included within the chapters, which all too often are left out of other textbooks. Practice problems are included when necessary. In summary, I would highly recommend this book for those looking for a comprehensive source of information regarding groundwater hydrology."
4,Amazing,These books have become my favorite. Me and my freinds are hardcore fans of starwars and we have both read these books. these books take place between movie one and two.
4,A very interseting read Into the mind of a teenager living between two worlds,"The author did an excellent job of researching the circumstances behind the killing of this young man I was able to develop a deep understanding of the challenges an inner city youth must endure even when he has had access to a ""better"" chance at life. I believe that the author tried in earnest to report the facts as he discovered the, and did show bias toward anyone."
2,Trite and predictable,"I picked up this book because it said it was a smart woman's book. I read a lot and want more than one dimensional characters and predictable plot. The main character was so naive and spineless, it was laughable. She lived her life based completely on what others wanted her to do or ordered her to do, of course until the end. Her husband, the minister, had virtually no redeeming qualities, he saw her as a possession and treated her like a child. The remaining characters were stereotypes, the socialite, the pious church-goer, the racist. The writing was juvenile and annoying. At one point, the main character was having a serious discussion and called the other person ""Mr. Know It All""."
5,Likeable characters and interesting issues,"I found this book a very quick and enjoyable read, yet it covered some serious issues. Dean was a strong character, a woman who wants to do the right thing and be a good wife to her minister husband who lifted her out of poverty. I loved Dean from the first scene where she spills something all over her white suit at an important function. Other wonderful qualities she has is the ability to reach out to others, even those who are different, and the ability to see through the hypocrisy of some in the church community.King humanizes the husband, yet clearly Dean is the true Christian rather than her husband. It is Dean who defends and cares for the homosexual couple that is attacked. It didn't take long into the book before I was hoping Dean would leave her emotionally abusive husband.-Donna Meredith, author of ""The Glass Madonna"""
4,Enjoyable,"I really liked this book. I don't understand buying a book because the author is married to another author you like, then griping about it being disappointing. If you want Conroy, buy his books. Ahem. But I digress.Dean is married to a man of God who is anything but angelic and happens upon a town of gossips and people to gossip about. She befriends Augusta who is a free spirit with a past that enables her to make a connection with Dean. Dean discovers herself and how she's sold herself short on life just in the nick of time.I found the book entertaining, fell in love with the little boy, Gus, and wished at times I had a friend like Augusta who would draw attention to the times I was in jeopardy of selling out.It's a good read."
2,"I'm sorry, Cassandra","I really wanted to like this book; honestly, I did! But the lead character had no backbone at all. God knows, I've had trouble standing up to people myself, but when Dean finally cussed her controlling, insensitive, neglectful, boneheaded husband out (and I was thinking YES!!!), she humbly apologized in the very next paragraph! No, no, no!!! Ben's backside needed kicking, and Dean was certainly justified in kicking it.Aside from that, the book was just too predictable. There were very few surprises, and I couldn't believe how long it took Dean to catch on to things that seemed so obvious to me. Overall, I was very disappointed in the book. It was a struggle to finish it. As much as I admire Ms. King's enlightened view of gay people and other ""hot button"" issues, I cannot recommend this book."
3,Entertaining but flawed,"All in all The Sunday Wife was an entertaining read. However, the two main characters (Augusta and Dean) seemed thrust together for no apparent reason in the beginning. I never understood why these two women could become such fast friends. Other than that, there were some surprising turns and twists and it certainly kept the story going at a good clip. Overall, a good book, but not the best."
1,UGH!,"Such drivel! This book is poorly written, with improbably situations, unbelievable characters and certainly unlikely outcomes. Even the grammar is poor!Save your money. Buy something more worthwhile."
1,Why did I read this??,"Had this not been the selection for our monthly book club, I would not have slogged through it until the end. The negative reviews written here also reflect my thoughts about this book."
3,"Good story,a a bit too sappy and at least 1/4 too long","2 things wrong with this book. It was at least 1/4 too long,should of ended it before you got so tired of Dean crying all the time,and if not her then some one els. She should of lost her cowardness of her over bearing Revrend husband, and the author should of made her realize some courage and what she wanted for her life with out dragging it out till you are about to pull your hair out. For the first 3/4 of the book,you are pretty well taken with it,but she spoils it for you before you get to the end."
1,Lifetime movie in print!,"Having been born and raised in Alabama, I really wanted to like this novel. However, I was extremely disappointed in it. It is exceptionally predictable; the main characters are cliched, absurd, or exaggerated; and it contains simple and inane dialogue. In other words, it reads like a Lifetime movie! On the positive side, it is a quick and easy read, and sometimes you just may be in the mood for something simple and brainless. Or, if you really enjoy Lifetime movies and Danielle Steele books, then you might like this. [...]"
2,"Predictable, cheesy and psuedo-political","I was looking for an entertaining beach read, so did not have high, literary expectations - but even so this book was a big disappointment.Filled with cliche dialogue, predictable plot line and mushy attempts to build quasi-feminists characters, I suffered through it because I had nothing else to read."
1,Pass on this one,"This book was disappointing. The plot was predictable, nothing new here. The affair between Dean and Maddox didn't fit in with the character's personalities. I wanted to feel a strong dislike for Dean's husband and for Libby but I never did. Mostly I just didn't care about any of these characters. Waste of time..."
1,Social agenda,"This book read like a first novel. Shallow predictable characters, predictable plot. It would have been better, too if the social agenda were not so obvious. The book feels like it was created tmerely to bash men, marriages and religion. The protagonist is too much of a victim to make her interesting, but I found the gay couple quite charming sympathic characters."
1,"Tried, but couldn't continue reading","This was the first book I've picked up by this author. As hard as I tried to give the benefit of the doubt and see the point of view, it just got to be more than I could enjoy (which is why I read novels) when the flat-out name calling started in Chapter Five - ""a dimwit Republican right-winger - though I guess that's redundant"" and ""bunch of dingbat antifeminists"", plus a preacher's wife using ""Jesus"" as a curse word - I'd had enough. If you are a ""liberal"" you will probably thoroughly enjoy this book, as you are lauded throughout. If you even lean center or right, don't bother. Would have had the basis of a good story if it had done less ""preaching!"""
5,My new favorite author!,"This book is absolutely wonderful. Like many other people, I bought the book because Ms. King is married to Pat Conroy. Mr. Conroy, you did well! Your wife is as talented as you are! I was blown away by Casandra King's entrancing story plot which kept the interest building to the point that I couldn't put the book down. Her use of language makes you really picture the scenes and action of the story. I am looking forward to reading her first novel and all upcoming novels!I am giving a copy of this book to my minister's wife! I'd love to hear her reaction"
2,Dean needs some backbone,"I enjoyed reading this book and read it quickly but had to laugh along the way due to the silly choices made by the characters. On a long road trip, I told the storyline to my husband, and it seemed even more unrealistic. I just found it hard to swallow that Ben, the pastor, could be that clueless about his relationship with his wife or that Dean could be so easily influenced by whomever she was with at the time. Dean goes around like miss fixit without a clue how to live her own life. Cassandra King just carried the truths that are there too far it seemed to me."
1,"Took a while to get into the story, then I just wanted out","I felt the book was quite contrived. It's a matter of personality if you identify with the characters, I suppose. I didn't, but hung in there to see where they went. More than once the story took such unbelievable turns, I lost all respect for it. I realize I'm reading fiction, but a character (or two) appearing out of nowhere with no explanation as to why they are there is hard to get over."
1,Strong Start,"This book got off to a strong start. The first hundred pages were filled with interesting characters, strong conflict, and an inside look into a Southern church community. The setting entices, and the book avances at a lively pace. Unfortunately, the narrow minded stereotypes hindered the depth of the characters and resulted in a predictable stale story. The book had potential but failed to meet it."
3,"Sunday Wife, Cassandra King","Ms. King tells a wonderful tale, but who edited? One prime problem was regarding a woman on medication, near a mental collaspe. She took Zantac? More likely, she took Xanax. There are several errors with changing tense incorrectly and sentences that go on forever. With a story of this strength, Ms. King should track down and stomp her editor!"
3,Entertaining but Slow,I found this book to be very realistic and quite entertaining. This is the first book that I've read by Cassandra King and since I am African American I am used to reading these types of books written by African Americans and their church experiences. It's very funny how different races can have very different but somewhat similar experiences in church. The antagonistic church women were the same and so was the Ben character. I know that there are many women like Dean in the world I was irritated by her weakness and her inability to stand up to her egotistical husband. Its sad that people like him tend to always meet people like her and end up in a terrible marriage. Overall I thought the book was pretty good but slow at times.
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed and couldn't finish the book. It just didn't hold my interest and I was so hoping it would. I really wanted to like this book and its characters but I didn't.
5,The Sunday Wife,"One of my favorite all-time books. I'm reading it for the second time, and hope Ms. King is working on her next book."
4,Loved It,"This is the second of Cassandra Kings books I have read and I loved both of them, interesting characters (though not all likeable). Enjoyed the journey with Dean."
1,worked great until it wore out,Product was great and kept my wet and dirty coveralls off the seat. Then after about three weeks the fabric material separated from the edge seam. It still works but is mostly just bare wire coils showing. I am hard on things but Grandpa had a similar product that had a stiff polypropelene like fabric that lasted years and he worked in a coal mine.
3,Reaction time too slow,Seams to keep accurate temp but reacts too slow to temperature change which is a feature so when you open the door and let a burst of cool air in it does not read low. Sitting it upright on the base does not work well as it falls over and/or falls between grids too easily
3,One Last Trip Aboard the Jupiter 2,"While the majority of this DVD is a rehash of other Lost in Space documentaries, it is worth purchasing for the last 10 minutes of the main feature - in which Dr. Smith and Will reappear aboard the pretty accuruate reconstruction of the Jupiter 2 - in full character and costume. The late great Johnathan Harris shows he can still play Dr. Smith to a tee. While its a shame he did not live to participate in the ""Voyage Home"" TV movie, this is the next best thing seeing these memorable characters give it one last show. Also interesting is the ""making of"" segment showing the filming of the final segment. No serious Lost in Space should be without having this DVD."
3,Forever a fan,"I was curious, and the reviews were fairly good, so I bought it. I enjoyed it, mainly for the interviews with the cast, and Guy Williams' screen test. The rest was just a repeat of what you'll find on the season three DVD. Still, if you're a true LIS fan, you'll want to have it for your collection."
3,lost in space forever,it's ok but it would have been alot better if the narrater was mark goddard (major west).
1,HORRIBLE!,"When you're watching a documentary and you know more facts about a particular subject then they do, you're in trouble. AND I'M DEFINATLY NO EXPERT ON THE SUBJECT! This pathetic excuse for a documentary is little more than an excuse to plug that horrible remake film. YES they interview most of the original cast, but for a grand total of 5 minutes total! The last 20 minutes were wasted John Laroquette talking to ""THE ROBOT"" and Bill Mumy and Dr. Smith reinacting a new scene. BUT if you liked the pathetic extras on the original Fantasia on Laserdisc where the rambling fat guy went on about ""cherry tarts"" or the Laserdisc Star Wars box set which ended with the host talking to R2D2, this Lost in Space Forever is for you."
2,Terrible Controls,"First of all, I am a huge Star Wars fan. That said... This game looks like it would be a neat game and I'm sure it would...IF the play control was decent, but it's not. This has the worst play control out of every GBA game that I've played so far. Jumping is nearly impossible to do accurately. That alone makes the game far too difficult and bothersome to play. Things happen to my character all of the time. For example: I want to jump out and to an angle to jump to another platform, but the dumb thing jumps straight up and then I fall straight down into a pit. End of Life. THQ should have spent more time making the play control better or not released it at all. This game is a real disappointment."
2,I AM EVER SO ....,"Okay listen, I am a devoted Star Wars fan and so is my friend.We are both really into videogames and we wanted to get JPB because of the online reviews saying that it has a 2-player mode. What a load of crap! Not only does it not have a 2-player mode, but the game is extremely repetitive throughout the entire story(with the exception of one level).Not to mention the insanity I went through on all the cliffs.There is virtually no way of telling how far away something is, so you always waste a life falling off.Trust me, this game isnt worth the ... I paid for it.For the most part,the graphics are OKAY and it is pretty smooth too. But most of all I blame all the shopping sites thatlist under features: 1 or 2-player mode. What bull.They need to do their research before posting stuff like that.(SERIOUSLY)"
2,"Warning to ""mature"" Star Wars fans and gamers.","I was really hyped for this game. I read the previews, poored over the screenshots and hunted for the best buy. Finally, I plucked down my hard earned money. Guess what? I got ripped off. My mistake? This game is geared for YOUNG players only. I'm talking pre-teen. Here's why: The game manual practically reveals everything your going to encounter and the controls are loose. Game play is strictly by the numbers. Slash here, run there, nothing challenging or any chance to explore the SW universe via your GBA. As for the graphics? My 5 yr old was beside himself. (I'll admit there pretty cool.)That's right, I'm a father, that's why I said not for mature fans. There's not enough meat here for hardcore gamers to sink their teeth into and as for the SW oldtimers, unless your a collector I say wait and see if SW2 for the GBA will be better. Otherwise, this game is perfect for the Anakin aged. Know if only they had a Darth Vader or Yoda cheat..."
2,Kid's game,"My ten year-old brother-in-law picked this game out for me for Christmas, but I think he really wanted it for himself. The graphics and sound are very good, but the game play isn't very entertaining."
4,kool kool,Ok i bought this game and i thought it waz going to (...) but it rocked it is one of the best GBA games i have i like mace if u played this game on playstaion or dreamcast it has some what the same levels but changed but they stil have force powers and when a friend has it u can play togetherOK LATER
4,Star Wars Jedi Power Battles,"Please note that this game is rated T for Teen, NOT E for Everyone as Amazon says!"
2,"Not his best work, or even a mid range work, maybe his worst","Jim Thompson IS a great writer, he writes vintage crime noir, and most of his tales of the seaminess of man are terrific, but this is not one of them. And it begins terrifically to boot, so one becomes more and more suprised as one reads on, for the book simpily gets worse as one reads. The characters are mostly two dimensional, and the plot loses all coherence quickly. Please, pick up his four star works like The Getaway, The Grifters, and a personal favorite, Now And On Earth, et.all."
3,A lesser work of the Thompson canon.,"The Transgressors fails to make the grade as a novel because it contains far too many preposterous plot elements. Almost nothing that happens in this book rings true. Protagonist Tom Lord comes off as foolhardy and, at times, just plain foolish rather than as the man of breeding and intelligence he is purported to be.A couple of the more minor characters (I'm referring here to George Carrington and Buck Harris) are described in such a way that the reader will be able to recognize them as representing flesh and blood people even though they themselves are over-the-top caricatures. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of The Transgressors' characters bear no relationship whatsoever to anyone inhabiting the real world and are, therefore, not very interesting and completely forgettable.Even the most diehard Jim Thompson fans will have to admit this book has very little to offer."
2,Half of the DVD is bad,"The DVD is 84 minutes. Half of them are computer animated morphed pictures. For my sense that's not suitable for the silent underwater world. The ""normal"" second part of the DVD is ok. But i wouldn't buy the DVD a second time. The film sequences are not of very professional quality. Not so sharp... There are better DVDs of the underwater world."
2,This video is all wet,"I bought this video expecting to have a crisp picture quality on my 36 inch HDTV, similar to what I would see on my salt water aquarium....boy was I wrong. The picture quality was very poor, at times grainy. Although the hypnotic music was very relaxing, I could not get pass the picture. Also, I was expecting a more flowing camera shot; instead, the camera would focus on one fish aspect for 6 seconds and then continue on to the next. Overall, if picture quality is the reason for buying this DVD, then do not buy it."
4,seems to be ok,I am only going to assume it does what it says. I have 3 snakes and I use it on all 3 of them and it doesn't seem to bother them at all.
4,Its great!,This is great product but the reason i gave it a 4 star is because when i opened the box the Reptisafe was leaking and wrapped in tape! The rest is fine i recommend it only that the packaging is not good.
4,Instant water conditioner,"Just what it states; instant water conditioner. Great with using tap water, just add the water conditioner."
4,Solid Effort,"On his impressive 1989 debut, Clint Black was KILLING TIME. Four years later, on this release, Black had NO TIME TO KILL. It's no wonder, as stardom led to a hectic touring schedule and marriage to a Hollywood vixen, in addition to his commitment to write all of his own material.Black's traditional brand of western swing provided some of the best moments in late '80s - early '90s country and he continued to maintain this level of uptempo excellence with the title cut and ""Good Run Of Bad Luck."" A ballad, however, provided Black with his best recording up to that point: a spinetingling duet with Wynonna on ""A Bad Goodbye."" The sparse ""Half The Man"" hits home emotionally as well. A couple of the other ballads aren't too memorable and create a few potholes along the way. Overall, though, NO TIME TO KILL was a strong effort which kept Black in the country fast lane."
3,The Beginning Of The End?,"This is album #4 for Mr. Black. After three awesome CD's Clint started to sound too commercial. This album isn't bad but compared to his first three, it falls short. There are a few good songs such as the title cut which has a similar sound to We Tell Ourselves from his last album. A Bad Goodbye with Wynonna Judd is a weak ballad that dosen't compare to Loving Blind or The Hard Way or even the Martina McBride duet ""Still Holding On"". Tuckered Out is a goofy little ditty song with several country artists named into the lyrics with Tanya Tucker being in the title- I quickly got tired of this novelty song. Whatever happen to great closing songs like Wake Up Yesterday and The Good-night Loving? Anyway, if you want a good Black CD, go out and buy The Hard Way, Put Yourself In My Shoes or Killin' Time. Only buy this after you have heard those and then you'll know what I'm talking about."
5,One Of The Best Ever.,"This CD Contains Some Songs That Are On The Greatest Hits Album. Some Are Not. The Songs I Like On Here Are The Title Track, ""State Of Mind"", ""A Bad Goodbye"" A Romantic Duet With Wynonna Judd, ""A Good Run Of Bad Luck"" Which Appeared On The Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster Movie ""Maverick"", ""Half The Man"", And ""Tuckered Out""."
4,Excellent Score,"While I thoroughly enjoyed this CD, I sincerely wish that the song that Reg and Jody perform on the front porch was included. They made an awesome duo."
4,Works,I have used this under my eyes and it seems to do a great job brightening my eyes. I use many different products depending on how i feel that day. And i will definitely keep this as one of my under eye concealers.
5,Love this stuff,best stuff for dark under eye circles. It doesn't last all day but it's gentle on my sensitive skin. Wish it was cheaper tho
2,not quite,"this concealer is quite cakey when applied under the eye i do love the color it matched me well if only i can figure out how to make it work for me so its not cakey and looks smooth, it can only be applied under the eyes though cause if i apply it anywhere else on the face i grow a pimple on that spot"
2,Too good to be true,"When I read the description for this product and all the wonderful reviews, I thought I finally found my dream concealer! But I was wrong... It covered fairly well and looked good at first but it ended up settling into my fine lines soon after. Exactly what it's not supposed to do! Even after I tried setting it with powder it still ended up creasing just not as bad. As the day went by it looked cakey...I'm only 23 but have dark circles and fine lines and this product does not do the job. Don't believe the hype."
2,lightest color is way too dark!,"I usually wear Ivory in several brands (everyday minerals, revlon, cover girl, maybelline), but the Lighter Than Light color was much too dark. Sadly, I had to send it back."
5,fair complected,"I have tried numerous undereye creams and this is really the best. The only thing I changed about it is to not use the pad it comes with, but to use a makeup brush. That created the perfect look for me once I placed my foundation. I also moisturize before I place on any make up. I highly recommend this product!"
