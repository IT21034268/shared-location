4,In defense of the novel...,This is actually a response to the above reviewer. I think he/she may be confusing the Spartans with the Sacred Band of Thebes who paired up with a lover.
5,Living the 'Gates of Fire',"As an avid reader of historical military fiction and a student of ancient Greece, I opened this book with high expectations. It did not disappoint. This was a soul-searing work that kept me up at night. If you enjoy experiencing what it might have been like to be a soldier in the ranks, both in the line of battle and in the lull times, this book offers an excellent vehicle. I've been to many of the battlefields of ancient Greece but not to Thermopylae. It will be part of my next visit without fail. Bravo to Pressfield- let's hope his next work is a worthy successor!"
4,Gates of Fire,The book was an excellent read. I enjoyed the writer's approach by telling the story from the perspective of a captured and wounded warrior. It was well done. Do not confuse this novel with a historically acccurate rendition of the event. Many details were clearly fabricated but remained entertaining.
4,Very well done.,"Gates of Fire is a masterful recreation in historical fiction form of the desperate Battle of Thermopylae. I'd recently finished reading The Triumph and the Glory, another novel I'd highly recommend, and thought it would be heard to top, but Pressfield has with Gates of Fire. Both great novels, read them!"
4,An Entertaining Read,"Great story, good pacing, the book never bogs down, and most importantly characters I come to care about."
5,An account of the creation of the warrior ethic,"Mr. Pressfield has rekindled in me the ideals that we in the military refer to as the ""Warrior Ethic"". He has captured what it truly means, and feels like to be a leader of men in battle. A moving account of the creation and destiny of a warrior."
4,Great ...for the right reader.,"...definitely an adult read. ...I know a U.S. Marine who got straight back from combat, read this book and said, ""Whoa. ...This is pretty harsh."" ...Seriously. That's not a joke....It may be a difficult read for most people who do not rape and pillage regularly. ...otherwise, it's well-written, and has a great plot which, I guess, makes it a great book???"
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT A MASTERPIECE AT ALL !","THis book is good reading, but not the masterpiece some reviewers said it is ! Not at all ! There are a lot of flaws in it ( I'm not meaning historically, but in writing style). The battle sequences are great; the idea of a squire survivng the battle and being hold captive by the Persians is great. But sometimes the books is lost in old cliches, like the plot involving Xeones and his old cousin, Deomache. It's totally useless to the history. The chapters are divided according to the most utilyzed character in it. In the chapter called ""Polynikes"", the great champion almost doesn't appear at all ! ANyway, it's fun to read. Better than Gemmell, for sure !"
2,disappointed....,"I was expecting a masterpiece....What did I miss? Every other review was great, I found the book so-so at best."
2,The spiritual heir to Starship Troopers,"There's a pretty good novel in this book, swaddled in pages upon pages of simplistic political yammering about the greatness of the warrior ethic. The book raises some troubling questions about its rah-rah Spartan ethic - why, for example, should such a noble culture /need/ a squad of assassins to take care of internal dissidents - but doesn't bother to answer them. Instead, everything gets drenched in blood and rhetoric about how great it is to be a dead Spartan. When Pressfield abandons the demagoguery, the book is a pleasure to read. Unfortunately, that's only about a third of a time."
2,Pedestrian,"Author has researched and imagined his topic well. I could have learned a lot. The situations are interesting, but characterization is regretfully superficial and the writing dull rather than vibrant or evocative. I gave up after a few chapters and donated the book to my local library. Young people might still enjoy it."
3,"Men, men, men , men....","Best thing about this book is how all the characters are always staring at each other's physiques. You know how those Greeks were, nudge nudge, wink wink. I guess the parts where they're all stabbing each other are good, too."
2,TRYING TO COPY,"Presfiled tried here to copy David Gemmel's outstanding ""LION OF MACEDON"". But he didn't. Gemmel's book is much, much better."
2,Couldn't finish this one,"Two chapters in and that was that. Boring! It's still on the shelf with a bookmark for some desperate, rainy day without something better to read."
5,Great Leadership Insights,I have been familiar with and used this book for about a decade to point students to servant leadership examples and also to inspire them to read good and accurate historical fiction in order to better understand history. Pressfield's descriptions are great and his characters truly represent admirable leadership qualities.
3,"Pretty good, good fights",A good military action novel but not a sterling piece of literature. Read it for good battle scenes.
5,read it.,"Pressfield is a rare talent, able to weave a story that's human-scale, historically accurate, metaphorically rich, and gripping - all at the same time."
4,Best read with a bottle of wine beside you.,"Read the battle scene with a bottle of wine beside me. I had to drink it. Otherwise, my throat would have dried up. A fascinating, gripping, moving story (despite the typos). I've read it twice. When my friends finish reading it (there's a long line, although two have decided to buy their own copies), I'll read it a third time."
4,History,An attempt to bring the Spartans and this important event in Western European history into focus. Shows how the course of the world can be changed by a few men. More fun than a history class and just as informative.
4,A tribute to heros,"Steven Pressfield has written a magnificent book that weaves a complex story of courage, duty, and obedience that has been an inspiration to soldiers and anyone who admires sacrifice for country and home. He places you in the minds of the warriors and does an excellent job of portraying the life of a Spartan, and other Greek City State soldiers during this time in history. I do think his description of the gore and slim of battle is a little far fetched but since there is no one alive that ever fought in one of these battles of antiquity his description is as good as anyone elses. The only reason I did not give the book five stars is because The Tides of War is vastly superior in scope and storytelling. However, Gates of Fire is a great read and a welcome addition to anyones library."
4,How an undemoratic society fought to save freedom.,The Spartan ideals of a society geared solely to produce warriors would seem to be at odds with modern views of freedom. Yet this society produced kings who fought beside their men and serfs who sacrificed themselves willingly on the battlefield of Thermopolaye. The battle scenes are grisly and fascinating. The author gives the Persians and their allies their due. They are brave men but they are slaves. Even as the Persians finish off the Spartans in this titanic battle you know they will lose later when they face the full might of the Spartan fighters.
5,Good motivation,"Teh other revieweres have done a very good summary of the book, so I must be brief.Those who:- Like reading adventure and passion (in this case a different kind of passion, full of pain);- Wanna have some fun, because you won't rest before the end;- Are sympathetic to Ancient History;- Are willing to know how spartan warriors thought and made their strategy;must read the book.To some extent, the history gives you strength and motivation to keep fighting not a field battle (of course), but the life battle."
5,300 Spartans at its best,"I'm a history buff, plain and simple. Ancient Greek historical fiction tends to pique my interest more than most other genres, and Gates of Fire is a perfect example of why. The story is tried and true, with no doubt when opening the front cover that the Spartans await death--but the way Pressfield crafts it and adds suspense to the mix was spectacular to say the least. There was certainly a lasting impression, and I believe this does more justice to the battle of Thermopylae than any other piece of literature has done prior.I can't add much more than the other reviews have offered to date, but anything less than 5 stars wouldn't be a just review."
4,"Quick historical fiction, love it.","I got this book as an Amazon sugguestion. I didn't think too much of it until I picked it up. I know it is fiction, but I really like the ""history"" behind it. In fact, I have been slowly doing more and more factual research behind it. It was easy and quick to read. If you are looking for detailed maps and a lot of history in the form of fact you will need to go somewhere else. I liked it because it WAS fiction and not weighed down by too much history. I like the history but for a good summer read pick this one up."
4,Historical Virtual Reality,If you are interested in catching up on your history in a graphic exciting way then this book could be your venue. Almost as if you were in a virtual reality history class. Too bad teaching methods can't be this evocative and historically entertaining!
4,"Riveting at times, very interesting","I am shocked at how so many reviewers are shocked at the good reviews this novel received. Who cares about historical accuracy. It is a novel after all. History is always always slanted. Does one actually expect a historical fiction author to relive the event? Throughout the novel I found myself amused, in awe at the training descriptions, captivated by such concrete battle scenes, and feeling for the characters. The chracters are all admirable in their own ways, each conveying the valor and vulnerabilities of human lives. All in all it was a rewarding read that sparked my interest in learning more of actual Spartan history."
4,An attention-grabbing read...,"While the story may not be entirely historically accurate (but who can say for certain - after all it was a long, long time ago)it certainly is a very interesting read. It grabbed my attention from the beginning to the end. The clever use of a story within the story gives the narration depth and provides the reader with a clear picture of the characters involved. Steven Pressfield provides an education by interweaving the Greek origins of many words used in our modern language, even though some of the Greek expressions are only sketchily defined. Even though, the use of Greek expressions lends further credibility to the narrator and his (albeit fictitious) role in the historical battle of Thermopylae. - If you travel to ""Hellenic lands"" be sure to stop by this famous battle ground - the marker is not very impressive - but the feeling of the battle is still in the air and seems to echo from the rocks surrounding it."
3,a journey into the Spartan mind,"A nice and highly enjoyable read. Not so much for historical accuracy or as an ""action novel"", but for the analysis of the Spartan mentality as it emanates from the various characters. I found that to be the most interesting aspect of the book and I would recommend it even based on that sole strength..."
3,Loved it!,"This is a great adventure yarn based on the historical defense of Greece by Sparta at Thermopylae. It was extremely well done, and the author was able to convey the Spartan spirit very well. Told through the eyes of an outsider and newcomer to Sparta, someone who eventually serves at Thermopylae, you get a real sense of the importance of this battle to history. I really enjoyed this book."
3,Well researched & detailed but long,"Definitely a lot of research, although some descriptions are based more on hypotheses than on real historical facts. Nice instructive reading, but why so long?Cut one third of repetitions, and you would have a 5 stars..."
3,IN BETWEEN,"I am a ninth-grader in World Studies 1 Honors. I rated this book a 3 because personally I don't care for war books, it doesnt interest me. I also think the vocabulary was a little hard, and you would have to know information about this war in order to understand it more. I think that if I was interested in war books I would have enjoyed it more. It goes into depth about every situation, its very drastic, and it makes you feel like you're actually there. It does get very confusing. I forget who's fighting, and who is who."
3,Limited. Read Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy instead,"on Alexander the Great. Thermopylae was the Sept 11 of ancient Greece, and mobilized all of Greece to tackle the Persian threat more aggressively. But it wasn't till Alexander the Great led Greeks and Macedonians to fight the Persians. Reading this book gives you a slice of history. For a more expansive view and better grounding in the history of the times and the way they shaped our lives, read Partha Bose's Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy or Robin Lane Fox on Alexander"
3,Gates of Fire Reveiw,"I am in 9th grade and I read this book in World Studies I Honnors. This book wasn't exactly the best book I have ever read, but it wasn't the worst either. It was about a young boy named Xeo, and his city-state was burned down when he was young and his parents died. As he got older, he decided that he wanted to become a Spartan soldier. Though he couldn't hold in his hands more than a bow and arrow, he couldn't help but want to fight among the other Spartan solodiers."
3,Review for Gates of Fire,"I'm in the 9th grade and my class had to read Gates of Fire in World Studies 1 Honors. Though I enjoyed the book I think it was a little hard to read. It wasn't something I'd give my friends to read.Gates of Fire seemed so much longer than it really was, mostly because of all the hard to read names. It also, to me, tended to be confusing. So many things to follow, it was hard. A bit diffacult to follow, it was a good book.I think it was a pretty accurate story. Pressfield didn't just make up the story, simply weaved a story by taking facts and imagenation. It did use a bit too much curse words.The story seemed like it could have been all facts."
2,Good except when they weren't fighting,"Remarkable combat scenes. However, in between the fighting is some of the most awful dialogue and awkward artificial characters I've ever encountered in print. Ham-fisted attempts to show the development of bonds between characters, e.g., soldier-camp hilarity surrounding a massively well-endowed man. Lots of goo-goo-eyed admiration of male physique and heroism."
5,Just could not put this book down,"I read it in three days and missed a lot of sleep in the process! Lol! If you're a fan of ancient history and enjoy reading, or just know of someone who is, then get this book."
4,Great novel if you have the time to concentrate,"I wouldn't classify this as an easy read, however it's well worth the time if you have it. The story line is gripping and well thought-out; would recommend to anyone High School and up."
3,Nice fake music,"I thought this would have some nice hokey music with alot of bass. But I found it very repititious. I think it's not really music from old movies, but made with a sound music program.I have Acid 4.0 and I can recognize alot of loops used."
4,Good Compilation,"Nice set of mid 70s acid jazz and funk. Tempo changes nicely from all funked out to smooth jazz. I like the transition between the songs with the dialog from the different classic porn movies. I like the digi-pac package as well. The booklet has nice photos (very nice I might add!) with a short documentary essay from one of the more prolific porn directors of the 70s. My only gripe is that they dont credit all the movies these songs were taken from. All in all it's perfect mood music for those ""special"" occations."
3,Only 3 stars for Dora,"The price and the design is really great, we love Dora,and the stars that disappear when wet. We give 3 stars for the above. Yet we have to deduct stars because once wet, you have to remove clothing inorder to replace a dry trainer. That is worth 2 stars. If they redesign it with the velcro sides, it would then be a 5 star product.God bless!"
4,Tasteful and Funny,"This book was one I couldn't put down. I was very heartwarming and quite witty. I thought Lucy Frank just put a devine spin on the book that made it all worth while. If anyone feels even the slightest bit down in the dumps, this book can really cheers you up. I recommend it in the highest manner. It all starts with Joy, receiving the news that her very sick Great Uncle Max having to move in with her family. So, on top of trying to balance her social life, she has to deal with him. After her life becomes nonstop mayhem, it turned out utterly enjoyable."
5,This is such a fun book,"I thought that this book was a light, funny book that would be good on summer days. It is really like a real teens life. I would definately reccommend this for anyone over the age of 10. Somehow this book would relate to your everyday life. The character development was wonderful, so you really got into the lives of the characters."
2,not good,i couldnt even finish this book once i was half way through. i felt like i didnt identify or like the characters and i never sunk into the plot. it is one of the few books that i really did not enjoy at all. NOT reccommended
5,Joyful indeed!,A cheerful book with a lot of potty and interesting characters. Uncle Max is everybody's uncle who takes a perhaps not so welcome interest in a typical high school student's life. The twists and turns of matchmaking make for a lively book with a happy ending.
3,Oy Joy,"Oy Joy is a book about Joy and how her and her best friend Maple take a match making quiz. Life is all fine and dandy for Joy until her Uncle Max comes along and she is forced to take care of Uncle Max and pair up with her little brother in his room. Well if that's not bad enough, Uncle Max starts to interfere with Joy's love life. I thought this book was fairly entertaining, but it lacked excitement, thus why I only gave it three stars."
3,Not as great as One Day,"I admit, I was really looking forward to reading more David Nichols after becoming completely engrossed emotionally in One Day (although I am still trying to erase the cinematic version from my memory). I picked up this one, and although it is a quick and relatively entertaining read, it didn't really leave me with anything after I finished the last page. Sure, the characters are likable enough, I guess, but the story just never got there for me. If you're looking for a quick beach read, this may do it for you, although there are plenty of other novels out there for that too."
4,SUPERIOR FOLK-ROCK,"Steve Booker is by no means a household name, and yet he should be. 'A Far Cry From Here' is an excellent album, full of beautiful thought-provoking soundscapes. Standout tracks include 'Silvertown', which could be about any boomtown in the present climate, and 'Angel Of The Sunset.' The rest of the album is just as good, although clocking in at under 25 minutes loses it one star!Booker sings and plays like he means it; it's a true shame that there isn't more stuff of his around. If you get the chance, try and get a copy of his 1990 offering 'Dreamworld' from Parlophone; made on a bigger budget with traditional Celtic instruments accompanying orchestral arrangements, it's a rare treat."
2,i have to ask ..,"Two stars to get your attention! Really its a 5 star book but the reader deserves 2 starsAlthough i liked the book i very much like franz barton . I found it tedious and somewhat boring. i have to ask why would one do these exercises? i wonder what people think they will get from this book ? power ,? closer to god? ,some kind of key to hidden gnosis? the divine powers franz bardon had? lots of ritual and pomp after halfway through i think i got the joke. it reminded me of the sufi book "" the book of the book"" but i guess one could get a lot out of this book but you have to ask you self why ? and for what reason? and who wants to know?"
4,Flashlight T-4 Battery,I have T4 Inova Flashlight and battery. It has a great beam and multiple functions. I see why lots of law enforcement use the light. Very satisfied.
3,Good charger,"It's made by Sony, its a good piece. I don't use aftermarket on chargers, so this was a no-brainer."
3,Book vs. E-reader,I got this book for a friend who was trying to assimilate into the Chinese culture & thought this would be helpful. It was but he was much better off with an electronic translation machine or an e-reader. Helpful book but not overly impressed.
2,"Great Cable, Better & Cheaper Alternatives","I purchased three of these for my triple monitor gaming setup, and I am thrilled with the build quality. Very Solid, even stylish. Picture quality is what I would expect from a HDMI/DVI cable.A couple weeks later I purchased the same type of cable from Monoprice for use on my another triple monitor setup at my office. I found them to not only have a better build quality, and even a smaller guage wire (remember, smaller gauge = increased cable radius, thus better signal). The picture and video quality of the two cables were indistinguishable. The best part is the MP cables are a third the price (and even sold on Amazon). So for better build quality, same image quality, and cheaper price, I'd recommend the MonoPrice Premium HDMI/DVI cable over this one."
5,Treasures of the Snow,"Excellent book for children, best for ages 5 to 16. Rich character development, adventure, strong hero models, and delightful reading. I have read Patricia St. John's books for years, and given countless copies as gifts. A great choice for parents to read with their children. (I'm an educator of children.)"
2,Christian Propaganda Piece,This would be an interesting book if real problems were handled realistically. Several problems occur in the plot for different children but they all solve themselves when the child involves accepts Jesus Christ. There needs to be a clear label ON this book that this is a christian sales pitch with some plot details added. I will give the writer SOME credit for using some plot details they remember from their childhood IN the book but can give no more credit for any material dripping in religious propaganda.
5,"A Very Good Book, Dumbed Down","This is a very good book. The author is obviously indebted to Johanna Spyri's Heidi, but in a good way. This book can be read aloud to children as young as 5, but young teenagers will also enjoy it. Be aware, though, that St. John's original text is out of print. What Moody and Scripture Union currently publish is an ""updated"" version--good if your child struggles with reading; but if your child is literate, get a used copy!"
2,LLEGO CON UN DETALLE,"ME LIKE THE PRODUCT BUT ONE BROUGHT A COUPLE OF DETAIL WAS BROKE, DO NOT CHANGE AS I CAN I AM FROM VENEZUELA AND CHANGE is very cumbersome"
1,This thing sucks,"Buyer be ware! I receieved a Warmrails Chelsea towel warmer as a gift and it does not work. The rails get hot, but the towel stays cold with the exception of a two inch space where the towel touches the top rail. I followed the instructions to layer towels - no improvement. I called the manufacturer and they essentially said tough s---. Save your money and look at another brand."
1,Defective Parts - Waste of Time,"I loved towel warmers in Europe and was looking forward to the convenience and comfort here in the States, but unfortunately, this WarmRails product was a bitter disappointment and a waste of time.When I opened the box, the pieces simply did not fit together and the parts included did not match the parts in the instructions. The base was much wide than the warming rack, so it was not possible to screw these pieces together.It looked like I received two parts from different models, or from older and newer models.I think it reflects very poorly on the quality of this manufacturer that they wouldn't even bother to ensure that they were shipping a working product.Now, I've wasted time and have to re-pack this and drop it off at UPS. I hope Amazon reads these reviews and stops carrying products from this manufacturer."
5,awesome towel warmer! Keeps the towel fresher longer!,I love my new towel warmer. A great way to start the day...with a little pampering!!
3,Warmrails not very warm,I was disappointed in the Warmrails towel warmer - my towels didn't dry from one day to the next. Also it doesn't have any type of automatic shut off or sensor to turn off when the items on it are dry so it just has to be either on all the time or manually turned off. It didn't work well enough to warrant the use of electricity all day and night.
3,tower warmer,it is ok. best for keeping the bathroom at a warm temperature. im not sure im properly laying the towels on the rack correctly but the warm spots are limited to small parts of the whole towels only.
1,No wonder it was on sale!,"I have waited decades to get a towel warmer, and when this one came up on sale, and made a featured product, I jumped on it. What a waste of a wall socket, floor space, time and money!! There has been no discernable heat tranferred to my towels from this product. It's a glorified, and WAAAAY overpriced vertical towel rack. Don't bother with this item."
2,Feedback,"It is a great product to keep your towel dry at all times. Whoever, the main purpose of keeping the towel warm does not exist. The rails get hot, but the towel stays cold with the exception of the areas touching the rails. I don't recommend this product if you are looking for a warm towel to dry yourself with after a shower."
2,Warming towel rack,"Seems to heat just fine, but arrived twice in a box that was open due to faulty glue. Both racks had knicks in the finish, therefore they are damaged. For $130 I expect more."
1,About the Author,"This book is a collection of sermons preached by Pastor Eric H.H. Chang in the 70's and 80's. According to the followers of the author, today Pastor Eric H.H. Chang has changed his doctrinal position, he no longer believe in Trinity and Jesus is NOT God. I guess as the title of this book, ""Becoming a NEW person"", the author has truly become a NEW person!"
5,Game table,This game table added a very nice piece of furniture to our game room. It is very heavy and very nice. We did had a problem with the product description indicating it had a roulette wheel built in and when it arrived it was a craps table instead that was under the tabletop. The company reimbursed the shipping cost since we opted not to send the table back. We have been able to use the table as extra seating for large family gatherings. I would recommend this table!
3,just OK,"-spoilers-i just finished this book last night. i thought it was a really well written book with an interesting plot. i just HATED the end. killing daniel definitely made me not want to read the rest of the books. his and kerrry's realtionship was part of what really made the book interesting and now that he's dead i just dont have any real interest in reading the rest of the books, so now i kind of feel like i wasted my time."
4,Not just for kids,"This is a fun book, and although clearly aimed at YA is well-plotted and thus fun for all ages. Marriotte's style his deceptively breezy, yet ten miles above Stine and his ilk, so you'll have a good time."
1,Great Gripping Story ... Terrible Plotting,"If you're expecting romance in this book, you will be VERY disappointed. I wanted a romance/magic/witchy kinda thingy. I have to admit, it was all of the above. Very mysterious, the kind that sucks you into the novel and won't let you go b/c the writing is just great.Its about a girl's summer and a hot witch(Daniel) that lands half dead on her doorstep. She helps him although she doesn't know him. Her curiousity gets to her and they learn more about each other, magic, and a powerful witch named Season. As you probably know, Season wants to kill Daniel.But if you really wanna know why its NOT a good read, read further. . . However, I am warning you.:::SPOILER::::::SPOILER::::::SPOILER:::The ending is just about the Biggest Letdown of all the books. Worse is that I bought the second book with high hopes that there'd be some kind of miracle b/c the story was so good. Well folks, there is no miracle."
4,Factory in a blender.,"This album is truly demented and diseased.It's like an entire metal works factory being thrown in a blender.It scares you. It intoxicates you. It wears you out.The myriad noises and pummelling repetition sit next to scarily manipulated vocals.It makes you look over your shoulder...This album is like when you drive past a horrific accident. You know that something terrible has happened, but you can't look way. You're curious and disturbed at the same time.It's addictive.It's a vice.It's a soundtrack to a post-apocalyptic midnight urban wasteland wander.It's a paranoid, drug-induced freak out in an abandoned warehouse.It's a homeless man, breaking out in sores, screaming at you on the train.It's a machine with a conscience that's following you down a dark alley.It's a horror film being played backwards.It's an insect infestation in your brain.It's like `Here Comes The Indian' moving to the big smoke, getting work on a production line, and going completely insane."
1,Dead dead drunkety druck,"Black Dice and Animal Collective are two of the most important bands in the world right now -- yet I say that this album is by no theory good. They took whatever came out first and looped it for one layer, distorted and reversed it for another, added a drab static-laced vocal, and called it a day."
3,"Not bad, but a little cloying and writting could be better.","Not a bad book, but I don't agree with his stance on anger and the writting is a little bit on the hallmark side. But some excellect suggestions for buddhist practice and good ideas on how to make your meditation practice work better."
1,Not for me!,A guy I met waiting in an airport recommended this book. It is not for me and I regret buying it!
3,excellent intro,"How-to books on Zen can sometimes sound a bit rarified and, oddly enough, spiritually superior. But not this one. It's serves as an excellent introduction for the beginner. Mr Bayda is very clear and sympathetic and he tends to demystify the ""practice"" that invites even the outsider in. The shortcoming, from my perspective, is that it tries to hard to make itself accessible that it sells the serious of the practice short."
5,Being Zen: Bringing Meditation to Life,A very clear and concise understanding of meditation. It is a wonderful addition to any mindfulness library.It is a very real approach to a significant way of life.
5,The best of Buddhism,This book along with FREE YOUR MIND (Sensei Anthony Stultz)and SWEET ZEN (Cheri Huber)represent the triumvirate of new presentations of the Dharma. So good!
4,"Gameplay is a pro, quality is nice!","I bought this while waiting for my PSP to come in, and now that I have played it I realize it was worth the money. The only negative is the police cars are overpowered, oh well."
3,Frustrating,"This game is fun for a while. It has nice graphics, a nice selection of customizable cars, a good variety of tracks, and a soundtrack that I wouldn't mind having on a CD. But the thing that really ruins the game is that the cops and the other racers don't play by the same rules of physics as you. If you fly past a parked cop going 190mph, he will magically catch up to you and ram into you within a few seconds. For many corners in the game, you have to brake ahead of time, but the other racers fly around them like slot cars without having to slow down. Once this happens, the frustration factor outweighs the fun factor."
3,Get this for PSP if you want to get revenge on the cops we last saw from Hot Pursuit,"Otherwise, get it for PS2pros: great grahics, more grip, harder opponents, smarter cops pursuit modecons: unrealistic cops(they ram you),no self-exploration mode, no tricks (knocking over things) to avoid cops.only reasons you should get this game for PSP-you don't have a PS2 or XBOX or GCN-you want to play online but don't want to pay PS2 or XBOX fees-you are going to go on a long road trip and your car does not have a TV or an electrical output to plug in a PS2 or XBOXreasons's why not to buy-frustrating, becasue your hopes of beating a level can be bulldozed off the guardrail mere inches from the finish by traffic or a cop-you can't drift (it's ok during the begining, but when you reach ranks 5-1, it's annoying how sharp the turns are), instead there is an annoying powerslide, in which you lose about 100MPH per seccond you slide-your opponents have overly good turning ability, which ends up unfair"
5,great psp game.,"my son loves his game,i will be buying more games in the future for this selller,Thanks for the items Ms q"
1,Buyers Beware!!!!1,DO NOT BUY!! very reppitive and all i can say is dumb bought it played it for 5 minutes than returned it horrible. i saw the reviews so i bought it i was wrong ans missled. u have no free roam all racing the same thing over and over again. use to be a big nfs fan till now this was a upsetDO NOT BUY unless u like dumb boring games
4,colorful and fun,My cat liked the mouse but I guess most cats like new toys :) The good thing about this one was it doesn't appear to have small parts that would come off so easily.
2,My Kitty Wasn't Really Interested...,She played with this toy for a few minutes then nothing. Ever again. :-( The quality is really great but she didn't want anything to do with it.
4,Good but lacking some things,This product is great but I wish that it had come with some VGA converters. Other than that this product is great!
4,"great music, shame about transfers","All Grand Kalle recordings would be 5 stars, being that Joseph Kasabele was (along with Franco and Jean Serge Essous the fathers of the Congoeese reumba)one of Africa's greatest recording artists. The music on this CD is no exception, it's a series of these recordings made after Nico and Rochereau left the band in early 1963 to form African Fiesta. Featured are such stellar musicians like Papa Noel on guitar and the curiously underatted Jean Bombenga sharing vocal duties with Kalle. Why then 4 stars, you may ask? Simple, the sound quality is way too muffeled, it has been over filtered and has little of the sonic spectrum the orginial recordings have (please note to reissue companies, tape hiss and crackles on 78 and 45 rpm records are not as bad as filtering the sound of the ""room"" of the orginial recording). Never the less try finding the orginials, and you see why I still recommend this CD (or any by this great artist), Yves Francois"
4,Benedictine Prayer,This is an older version (1993) of the Ampleforth's prayer book. I have the new version also. The older is interesting as it has some info the new does not. It was hard to find and came to me used from England. I use it quite a lot for my LOH.Mike
2,I've read better,"With chapter titles as provocative as ""The Book of Memory"" and ""Ordainers of the Universe"", one expects a meaningful analysis and a depth of insight that isn't here. The anecdotes are handy for erudition at cocktail parties, Mr Manguel has done his research, but i was hoping to be dazzled."
3,The absence of post-structuralist discource,"While I found the book enjoyable as one who is passionate on the subject of reading and of books in general, I found that the absence of post-structural discource to be a little omissive on the part ofManguel. He only mentions Claude Levi-Strauss once, and the concept of the death of the author and the entirely subjective reading process would have been greatly enriched by some of the french literary theorists of the early twentieth century.Samantha"
1,changes history to try and sell a book,"To those who are looking for the REAL history of Reading, Pennsylvania, dont waste your time on this book.I read it from cover to cover and the author didn't even mention the flood of '72! Someone obviously didn't do their homework!1"
5,A perfect gift book for the readers in your life,"Reading a fine book like this about reading is like reading about eating chocolate cake while eating a piece. I found myself slowing down to savor every idea and every amazing story. He is the perfect author for the topic: affectionate toward his subject, a good storyteller, and global in his perspective. Buy the hardcover. As a serious reader, you will revisit it for years to come."
4,"Delightfully readable, a little treasure of a novel","Joan Austen Leigh has written a refreshing spin-off of the classic novel, EMMA. This book was about how love can affect the young and the ""mature"" in completely different--or similar--ways. Mrs. Pinkney's tale of the trials of marriage was very captivating. The ending was very rewarding. All in all, ""A Visit..."" is very charming, and perfectly suited to be read with your Sunday afternoon tea."
4,Two-Tone Time,"There is no question about Seiko. They have made some really excellent watches over the years, and they have continued to show it over the years. With their automatic Seiko 5 watch series, they have definitely handled well. Their SNXJ90 5 Automatic Two-Tone Watch is a very clever and simple watch that works very well from beginning to end. I love the design of the watch and how easy it is to keep time with the watch. Yet, I do have a few minor gripes about the watch. One of them is the crown. It is tougher to pull out and set the time and calendar of the watch up than other automatic watches, and the bracelet is a bit more lightweight, and not as sturdy as some other watches. Still, if you are looking for a nice two-tone automatic watch, than the Seiko SNXJ90 5 would be a great buy.Price: BSetup: C+Overall: B-"
5,good look,"very sharp professional look, great with a suit looks just like a rolex date just and its an automatic can't believe how smooth the movement is and for the price you won't find a better watch"
3,Beautiful and well made...,"But it does not keep accurate time (runs too fast). After a week, you are looking at 5 mins. too fast (always). I never had a Seiko nor an automatic watch.My last watch was a Citizen automatic (never had problems keeping accurate time). I would not recommend this watch if you want accurate time. If all you want is to have the most elegant and beautiful watch around, buy this watch.It's funny because I thought the OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE of a watch was to keep accurate time. I guess that you live and learn..."
3,comment,It is a self winding instead of a battery operated. It's o.k. but I would not buy it if I knew it was self winding.
1,Don't buy,I would avoid this product. It was difficult to operate. This will be last product I will order from this seller.
5,Not a problem here,"Nice ,with a touch of classic style, Seiko 5, it is working and keeping good timing for a few years now."
1,does not retain time overnight,"if you don't wear the watch to sleep, the watch will stop. Then you have to reset the time again. What a pain."
5,A comprehensive training guide,"This is the kind of book I wish that I had years ago. Over my 30 years as a guitar player I have reviewed a half dozen books like this, hoping to ""find it all in one place."" This book is EASY TO READ and covers topics in ""plain English."" It is also COMPREHENSIVE -- it covers everything from basic tuning, to scales, to advanced chord inversions, to differences between guitar, mandolin, banjo...Want to teach yourself guitar? This is a reference you should not be without.I am planning to buy copies for my children's school and our local library."
5,One of TV's most underrated shows,This show is hysterically funny and it is consistent. There isn't a bad episode on any of the available DVD's. THe casting is perfect. All the characters contribute and all are funny and incredibly likable. If you haven't seen the show check it out. It's one of the best sitcoms ever that many have never heard of.
1,I can not belive this!,"I did not buy this dvd not even season 1, but I did watch it once and it kjasdfhjkldsfh (I can not say it my parents would get so angry with me if I wrote it on the internet)This show is a good for people 15 and up, but I think it is not good for children to watch. It has parents drinking,drugs, and some funny stuff but it is not sutable for young children to watch.Grade: D+ for the airing on tv"
1,Not what I thought I was getting,"Since the title, on Amazon, only said ""Live at the House of blues"", I took a chance and thought it'd be episodes of the television show ""Live at the house of Blues"" (aired during the mid 90's). I really didn't know what I'd get... but oh well.The dvd is actually a band called ""Adolescents"" playing live at the House of Blues.......For those would like to know, it was produced by Kung Fu Records, Inc.......Here's the song list.... 1:No Way.... 2:Who is Who.... 3:Self Destruct.... 4:Democracy.... 5:O.C. Confidential.... 6:Creatures.... 7:Welcome to Reality.... 8:California Son.... 9:Wrecking Crew.... 10:American Lockdown.... 11:L.A. Girl.... 12:No Freinds.... 13:Things Start Moving.... 14:Rip it Up.... 15:Hawks & Doves.... 16:Within These Walls.... 17:Word Attack.... 18:Amoeba.... 19:Kids of the Black Hole"
2,"Not for high insteps, not enough shock absorption","I bought these shoes, based on favorable reviews, but was disappointed. If you have high insteps, as do I, these shoes are difficult to put on and constricting. The biggest disappointment, though, is that they are not great for walking, which is why I bought them. I wore these shoes for an afternoon while shopping and after one hour my feet felt sore and my back was bothering me. This doesn't happen when I wear running shoes."
5,Great Shoes,Shoes arrived very quickly and packaged nicely.I am very happy with them and where they came from...especially the prices!
1,THE ORIGINAL MACHO ATAVISTIC SCHOOLBOY SILLINESS...,"Here it is-- the original CONAN from overweight hillbilly mama's-boy Bobbie Howard. This ""Barbarian"" shot himself when Mommie died and left the world more retro-Lovecraft schlock to feed on, only this time with gratuitous violence to lower the age level of the target audience. Rape, sadism, ""We are all Animals..."", it's all here. Ho Hum.Only permanent adolescents and Oliver Stone have been roundly impressed-- unfortunately, that's 78% of American males...."
2,Not the versions you're expecting,"If you're looking for the identical versions that you've heard on the radio, look somewhere else. The vast majority are alternate versions! Very disappointing."
3,Arrived on my i pad instead of my i phone,"So, all we ever actually have seen is the cover which is not very colorful. Wish it was easier to figure out Amazon Prime and actually find books that are supposed to be free to rent."
4,A great book...,"It reads very well. The story makes sense...the premise is just...Well, how awesome is a guy who can speak animal languages? VERY awesome!"
4,Review on Doctor Doolitle,"On the whole, I thought it was a very funny and cute little book. It was a little goofy. I did like that it was about animals and that they could talk. This book would probably be best for younger children or for adults and preteens looking for a comedy."
3,"Dated, but a classic","Imagination-inspiring, but the chapter about the black prince who wanted to be white was tricky. I had to improvise and be creative in my explanation for my small children. The short chapters were great for nights when my listeners were fidgety."
5,"terrific, terrific, terrific","I had originally read this book some years back (early in high school, I believe). This will actually be my second copy. This is an excellent book written early this century. It deals mainly in the decline in literature leading up to its publication. I truly recommend this to any literature fan."
1,Yet More Pro-Terrorist Propoganda,"It's sad to see that Mr. Land, once an excellent adventure writer, has taken the position of apologist for terrorists. The poor, put-upon Palestinians that Mr. Land continually lionizes cheered in the streets after 3000 Americans were murdered on September 11. In arguing that the Israelis occupy the same moral plane as those who slaughter children and then hide behind civilians, Mr. Land shows that he has lived too long in a world of fiction."
3,roung bars,"the bars are nice and well made,nice chrome,but they are not the bars i ordered,i called the company and was told they would make it right. they told me they would email me a return lable over two weeks ago, still havent heard from them."
5,Some of Prine's best.,"I have listened to this album more than most. I have also bought several copies to give to friends.I have a sketch artist who listens to this album while he draws and or paints. I am a Luthier and love to listen to this album while working in my shop. I also listen to it while napping in the afternoon. I had never heard the Kristofferson song on it, but love it. I also enjoy the Tom T. Hall song as well as Old cape Cod.I like a lot of things about this album.I built, played and sang with my own Banjos for years. I have always liked both Prine and Wiseman as song stylists.Great job guys! Glad you made the album!Re. RJ ""Banjo Bob"" Brown"
1,Awfully corny,"Sorry, love nearly all of JP's output but this is the worst I've ever heard, schmaltzy, corny, cringe-inducing, hurts me to say but it's the way I would see it. Bought it blind on the strength of all John's other stuff and regretted it immediately. If everyone else thinks it's great, maybe I can get my money back on ebay..."
1,Disappointed Prine Fan,I have just about every other thing John Prine has recorded and thought I needed this album too. Wrong. There's not an interesting song here so don't waste your money.
5,An inspiring story!,"In 1997,six-year-old Andrew Bateson came down with a severe case of bacterial meningitis,which sent him and his familyinto a frightening ordeal.Mark Patinkin has brilliantly captured their tale of recovery and redemption in this haunting book.Through his powerful,moving,and beautiful writing,the reader really gets to know,understand,and sympathize with theBatesons.Make no mistake-he does not present them as heroic,noble ""goodies"" in any way.We see how Andrew's illness nearlytears the family apart.But then Patinkin eloquently shows howit also brought them together again and closer than ever.The Batesons are an inspiration to all of us.""Up And Running"" is a remarkable achievement.Bravo!"
4,Another excellent Yourdon compendium,"While Yourdon has written his fair share of books, my favorites by him are the collections of essays, papers and talks he has put together. This one isn't quite as important, IMO, as _Classics in Software Engineering_, but it's still very good. The writings range farther, with more case studies (primarily business and IS systems), but also include seminial jewels such as C.A.R. Hoare's ""The Emperor's Old Clothes"", Knuth and Floyd's ""Notes on Avoiding ``Go To'' Statements"", Wirth's ""Program Development by Stepwise Refinement"", and Miller's ""The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two"", all ""must reads"". If you can find this book, buy it."
1,No Longer Any Good,"Over a decade ago, Lion's brand coffees were okay (personally I never thought they were as good as some people did; but whatever, they were at least acceptable). Lately, this brand has tanked to the point of undrinkability. I would advise you not to waste your money; and advise the Lion's Brand company to reconsider marketing swill to a formerly loyal customer base."
1,Horrible!,Couldn't even make it all the way throught. We watched it for a half an hour and in that time four guys walk into a house and are murdered. No blood. Terrible pacing. The score was ridiculously suspenceful when absolutely nothing was happening. It's almost as if Birdemic and The Room had a not even remotely entertaining baby which would be this steaming pile. Don't waste your time.
3,mockingbird lane?,I'm telling my age with that title. The Munsters on botoc's.Their address was 1313.this is my first and last purchased of these thirteen 13's.
5,A great fast pace read,This is the kind of book parents should be buying for their teanagers to read. It is not only written without profanity but has a real hero teens could look up to.
5,"A great story, good action, a really likeable hero","This is a book by an amateur writer, a Peoria, Ill., policeman who loved Louis L'Amour and decided to try writing something similar himself. He has succeeded.It's the story of an English kid who is orphaned and kidnapped and taken to the New World in the 17th century. By hook and crook and bravery and some luck, he survives the English murderers who are trying to kill him and the treacherous Indians who are trying to kill him and enslave another tribe of Indians who have befriended him.Fast paced, a page turner, lots of makeshift ingenuity and a really appealing love story (but nothing explicit, so it's good for young adult readers, too)."
1,Is this a joke?,"Sounds like it is being played on an Edisson phonograph, without the scratches! Do I need to type this? Obviously there are much better P.I. on Amazon, so... stay away from this one!"
4,Good Text,My S.O. is working out of this book for an ESL class at a local community college. Combines historical and other useful information along with the main goal of teaching English. Seems to be a well-thought out text though I really don't have any basis for comparison since I don't have much experience with ESL.
4,it's fun to play with if your a racing game fan,"my lil bro was the one who bought this game when it first came out for $33 at some game store. for a whole week he liked the game but didnt play the game seriously after that he went and bought dirver 3 and gave the game to me , now for me the game was really cool, ""im a big racing game fan"" so this game is in my top five right now .It my get boring in the beginning but ones you have allot of points and some experience using the game it becomes more interesting. but if your just looking for a good car game on the gba which is fun to play i say get dirver 3 but if you want to play a racing game get this game its worth it ."
5,AWESOME,JUST GOT THIS FOR MY FRIEND AND HE LOVED IT AWESOME HE LOVED IT I GOT IT FOR GAME BOY ADVANCE
2,break out,Unfortunately it made me break out. I didnt believe it and had to try it for myself. This week Ill try a tiny bit of the dose and see if it still does.
5,The Bongo Book we've waited for...,"Hats off to Trevor Salloum who has graced the percussion world with this wonderful book.With the help of two carefully recorded CDs, Trevor guides every level of bongo player into new and exciting domains.The CDs are accompanied with a notated workbook which describes each recorded rhythm in a straightforward tablature.Additionally, Trevor provides illuminating insights into the unique history of this wonderful instrument.Matthew Dubuque mdubuque@yahoo.com"
3,bongosero wannabe,I am impressed with the bongo book pub.It is giving me the info I need and emphasizes I have along way to go.
3,Bongo Stuff,"This item is okay, but could be better. It is very basic and not the easiest thing to learn from I might add. If you are buying bongo learning products I recommend just watching live recordings of artists that have prominent use of bongos in their music and observe videos of people playing online."
4,base cabinet lazy susan,"The instructions for assembly were not easy to follow, although the product went together easier without them. The product is well balanced and moves smoothly. It does seem like a bit of wasted space; mine is for canned goods and they could have thrown in an extra shelf. The price was decent also."
2,Not so much,"Being a compilation, it has everything (well, almost) on it. And, as you might expect, a lot of it is not good. There are too many simple surf songs with motorcycle sounds to kick the song off or end it. And there are some awful vocals. Yes, the Endless Summer songs are there, but after that it gets thin. There is a lot of movie soundtrack music that is completely unmemorable. And after you hear them play ""Cloudy"" you'll never want to hear that song again (maybe you don't already!). I don't think its worth the price, even used, just to get the Endless Summer theme. Find it elsewhere if possible. The lead guitarist and main composer for this group, John Blakeley, is still recording and has a very nice album out,Tan Mantisthat is much more listenable than this album. From a historical standpoint this is a necessary album, but its not one you'll play very often even if you are a surf music fan."
2,Not as advertised,"This item was advertised as an original 1952 printing of the book. It was, in fact, an 1980 reprint. I don't plan on ordering anything else from this seller."
2,A word of caution....,"If you are a vegetarian, trying to raise a vegetarian family, this might not be the best choice. Lone dog goes out for an adventure, plays with other dogs, plays with cats and rabbits, then meets a lone boy, they buy meat together, cook meat together, then eat meat together. Then they go to sleep in the dog's house. A little odd, but my son liked it and asks for it a lot. My husband and I both were put off by it, though we tend to like quirky and meandering stories. But I guess if you really like meat, this is the perfect little book. If you're more into the idea of a lone dog going on adventures, look instead for Dominic by William Steig. It's a longer book, but really packs in the excitement. My son frequently asks for a new chapter of Dominic."
4,another good find,A good read and in great condition. This book helped me in my research on this writer I was interested in.
1,War W/O Mercy is Lame,"This is about racial hatred between the Americans and Japanese in the Pacific in WWII. Racial hatred is Dowrer's default. Any thing that might be offensive to the Japanese, from propaganda to killing them, according to Dower, was racially motivated. There is even the suggestion that Americans didn't think bad enough of Germans. I have read a lot on WWII and found this thing pathetic."
1,Interesting but apologistic,"This book showcases many of the atrocities of the Second World War in the Pacific War, in particular, the rarely discussed misdeeds of individual Americans. However, the implication is that Imperial Japan did nothing worse than the U.S. Ghoulish Americans collecting gold teeth or the killing of fanatics unwilling to surrender is equated to executing prisoners and experiments on Chinese civilians. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this unless you need to difuse another apologist..."
1,"Oh, please!","Even if the author's conclusions are valid (which as often as not, they are not), so what? Why do so many people insist on refracting everything through a prism of their own making? John Dower may be a pretty smart guy, but he has no credential for purporting to know more about the history of the Pacific war than the people who actually created that history. Their chronicles are ubiquitous, exhaustive, and remarkably consistent, and thoroughly at odds with most of Dower's contrived conclusions.Ride the zeitgeist ere it tramples you."
3,"Not fantastic, but good.","I had to read this class for a WWII 300 level History class. I'm not a History major, but decided to take my elective in this. From that perspective, I found the book to be interesting, but dull. Very dull. Getting through the pages was a struggle for me. Concepts were valuable as well as Dower's analysis of propaganda on both Japanese and American sides. The included comics and cartoons was great--it really gave an idea of feelings at the time and what people were seeing. Book is very long winded, but does provoke deep thought."
2,Polemic against American attitudes toward Japanese in WWII..,"I read this book with some interest but left with the feeling that the author was trying to make an anti-racist statement rather than compile good history. He understates the Japanese mistreatment of other Asians and basically blames the ferocity of the war on American racial attitudes while failing to attribute appropriate weight to Japanese fanaticism. If you were compiling a large library on the subject you should have this book, but if you are looking for reasonable explanations of the Pacific War it's not so good."
5,Loved this book!!!,"As the editor promised, reading this book is rather like listening to friends' travel tales over a big plate of sushi. These are personal tales, up-close and detailed. From the ""electric bath"" to the ""odori-sushi"" (dancing sushi- you figure it out!) this is a look at Japan that you won't want to miss."
4,Anthology of impressions,"""Japan : True Stories of Life on the Road"" is a collection of anecdotal stories told by people who have journeyed to Japan.The strength of the book lies in the different points of view. Each traveler experienced a different Japan and has different things to say about the country and it's people. Some of the tales are funny, some are serious and some are informative. The book has a nice balance of styles, and there is very little replication. What is it like to go to a Love Hotel? What do you do when you are served living squid for dinner? What is a Kabuki play like? These are the type of questions answered by this book.It's weakness lies in the fact that many of these tales have been published elsewhere. If you have read many books on Japan, chances are you will have already read many of these stories. Several selections from ""Learning to Bow,"" ""Dave Barry does Japan"" and ""36 Views of Mt. Fuji"" are here.All in all, it is a good book, and worth reading."
1,wasn't worth the price,Shipping costs were more then the product.Did not even compare to the one that I normally get from the store (they were out of).
4,This series is such a helpful way of learning Math!,"This series is very helpful! I am currently working on getting my high school diploma AND my GED and I find these to be a good guide. Excellent review. Wish I had known about this series years ago. I hope this series makes more workbooks for Elementary school,perhaps college level as well. These are so well made might as well aim towards other levels of education. I also know it would not only be SO helpful-it would also increase the popularity of this series. They're so cost effective which is another wonderful thing!"
5,Kim Alexander-Technology Investor,"I have been an Information Technology Investor for over 20 years. I wanted to begin to invest in Nanotechnology companies. All of the other Nanotechnology books were discussing the science of Nanotechnology and I wanted to understand the business of Nanotechnology.Nanotech Fortunes provided a roadmap for a sophisticated technology investor like me without having a scientist or engineer explain to me how a ""Buckyball"" works.Thank you Darrell!"
1,Returned,"The product description says ""Single Pair of Goggles, One Pair Only. Random Pick of color. comes with elastic strap""...they do not come with an elastic strap! So if you tan in a stand-up bed these are useless."
2,These particular goggles must be seconds/imperfects.,"I have been using Eye Candy for years and love them. These particular ones here on Amazon though, are not first run quality. The little tabs on the side where you tie the elastic band are very thin and not complete, so my elastic keeps popping off and they fall off. Very poor quality. I wasted my $10. Not happy."
3,Average,"I enjoyed the full view - I haven't had that in goggles yet and really liked it!However the drawback is that these goggles are kind-of narrow fitting around your eyeball and cause your eyebrow area to really stand out while your tanning - the change made me burn right under my eyebrows and above the plastic. Its not painful, but its a noticeable hugging feeling around your eyeball that can't be considered comfortable. I'll try a different brand after these wear out."
3,Didn't work for me :(,"Item was just as described HOWEVER I can't use the goggles because when I set them over my eyes there's a big gap causing light to come in around my eyes and even the insert that came along with them said not to use them if that happens... so unfortunately I bought something I can't even use! Wish they came with some sort of clear elastic strap so I could keep them tight against my eyes, but no such luck! =/"
4,"Comfortable - but ONLY for tanning beds, NOT booths","Good goggles, feel comfortable, eyes feel great. They have no strap or anything though so you can only use them in a tanning bed not in a stand up booth."
3,they work well,i like these goggles they work well although they didnt do much for my racoon eye which was my reason for buying them.
1,Frog planter,The planter received did not match the color of item that I ordered. It did not meet my expectation. I did not like the item I received.
4,adorable costume,vendor seems a little disorganized (shipped wrong size/didn't get return slip with second shipment (as promised)/ Once I returned the first one they were confused as to why). but costume itself is adorable and of good quality.
1,Service,"I was satisfied with the product except the costume was too large so I needed to return it to the company, which I have, yet I have never received a refund for the product after attempting to contact them several times through email and phone."
4,From my study of nutrition and foods this makes sense,I like Charles's approach and his easy going techniques to creating a new healthy body. My life is busy and he makes it easy to stay fit. Recipes were an added bonus
5,This is a diet that makes biological sense.,After reading the book I started implementing Mr. Hunt's dietary suggestions and I've started feeling and seeing a difference in my health and energy levels. I would recommend this book to any one who is willing to have an open mind. Mr. Hunt's unconventional dietary suggestions make biological sense and refute the seemingly unsuccessful High-carb dietary dogma that has plagued our species for many generations. Long live protein!
2,this book is worth about half its price,"this book offers an overall view of a low carb diet. one would be better off purchasing a lower priced book written by a physician which offers answers to more specific questions. it also included recipes for alligator, bear, elk, etc. come on now, how many of us really eat that?"
1,Not worth your time,"A childish book, poorly researched and even more poorly written. You'll get a lot more out of reading anything else out there, both mentally and physically."
2,"Good CD, as far as it goes. And 11 songs, isn't very far .","In my opinion 'The New Christy Minstrels' had a sound like no other group, and I could listen to them for hours. And if you feel the same then you'll be sadly disappointed with this CD. Not that the music isn't great, it's just that there isn't enough of it. How can it be called their 'greatest hits' when it leaves out songs such as; 'Whistlin' Dixie', 'Way Down in Arkansas', 'Company of Cowards', and my favorite; 'This Ol' Riverboat'? No, this CD should have been entitled: 'A few of The New Christy Minstrels Greatest Hits."
3,"Good music but CD too short, not enough songs","I like this CD except for the version of ""We'll Sing in the Sunshine"" which is not the version I remember from 30 years ago that was a hit. All the other songs are as I remember them which is my reason for buying ""Greatest Hits"". I would recommend this CD"
4,THEM OLD COTTON FIELDS,"When I was 20 the Minstrels did a concert in my home town & somehow they ended up in my living room. My cousin & I were also performers during the folk ""scare""of the early 60s. I just got this album today & am istening to those old songs. Barry McGuire, featured on ""Green, Green"" also had a big hit on ""The Eve of detruction"" when he went on his own several years later.Some of my favs on this album are ""The Drinkin' Gourd""; ""Cotton Field,"" & ""Mighty Mississippi.""I hope you will enjoy this album as much as I did, & thanks for reading my review."
2,Not really a *workgroup* bridge,"This device is very expensive for what it does.This is advertised as a device that will wirelessly connect a small wired LAN to a main network having a wireless access point. It has two major flaws in this regard. First, the bridge does not pass NETBIOS traffic, which means Windows file/print sharing won't work. You have to configure the bridge in ""single client mode"" for this to work. A single client does not qualify as a workgroup to my way of thinking. Second, clients connected to the bridge cannot get dynamic IP addresses from a DHCP server located on the other side of the wireless link. Static IP configuration must be used.On the positive side, the bridge does support WPA2-PSK security. Throughput seems to be very good."
4,Deep soul for the 90s and beyond...,"An intriguing mix of chamber-style strings, post-funk drums, and virtuoso double bass. The album flows well, in and out of various themes, and builds to a cosmic crescendo. Not as much sax pyrotechnics as I was expecting from Chris, but his skill and playfulness still shine. Definitely a unique statement and something that will stay on my listening list for a long time. What stands out for me is not the musicianship as such, more the atmosphere it evokes: a kind of empty longing that somehow feels very good."
2,Doesn't fit,"The headset doesn't fit. I knew that there may be a chance, since I'm a small person (5 ft.). It kinda hangs off my ear. I does what it's supposed to though, but when it doesn't stay on your ear what's the point."
4,Good product,"Headset was sent promptly, along with a charger and instruction booklet. It did not arrive in manufacturer packaging, but in bubble wrap. Works fine, though. No problems"
5,Good Buy,"The product is a lot less expensive than what I have been purchasing from other vendors, however the quality is the same. That makes it a great buy!"
5,binders,I use these for my home business. Sturdy and just as good as the more expensivebrands I was buying at the local office supply stores.
5,useful and informative,"I bought this book as soon as it came out over three years ago, and I still refer to it this day for some sound, quality advice. It's a great resource for ambitious young people eager to learn some simple yet often thoughtful advice. I would recommend this book to parents, children, and young adults everywhere.Thank you, Mr. Gallagher, for this comprehensive and diverse compilation."
3,Incomplete,"The language is beautiful and the story engrossing, but it doesn't have a conclusion. It was like seeing only acts 1+2 of a three act play. I don't want to spoil the book, so I'll only say that there's an impending doom in the story, at the heart of the story really. The book ends when the doom strikes rather than coninue and show the ramifications of the doom and other actions in the book.Another analogy would be a disaster movie that ended as soon as the disaster hit. That's not a satisfying story because we want to see how people deal with the disaster and, in this book, we don't get to."
1,The worst book club selection EVER,"This was our February book club selection. The consensus was that this was the worst book that we had ever read. Some members couldn't even finish it. Reading it resulted in a 10 minute discussion on how we've never hated a book worse. Horrible plot, story, and characters. The main character Holden is dispicable and abusive. The book concludes at the climax, with absolutely no resolution."
1,not good,Incredibly weak. Fell off repeatedly.. then finally lost it. Bracelet has several charms but this one is very cheaply made. Incredibly disappointed.
3,"Quality product but it Won't fit Scotts 20"" mower as implied by Amazon","Although Amazon shows the Scotts 20"" mower ""Frequently bought together"" with this catcher, the catcher will not work with that mower. The catcher is too wide to fit between the wheels and adjusters on the mower. Although a very high quality product, it is useless with this mower (thus only a 3 star rating). I would have rated it higher had Amazon not provided an implied recommendation via their ""Frequently bought together"" which in this case, is extremely misleading. If I could apply two ratings, I'd give the product 5 stars and Amazon 1 star. Amazon should remove the association between the Scotts 20"" mower and this grass catcher from the page."
1,Corona Clipper Canvas Leaf and Grass Catcher,"This product is big and sturdy. However, it didn't come with any hardware to attach it to a lawn mower. I visited the Corona website and I could order any attachment hardware from the site."
4,Pretty Good,This book contains some good ideas for different kinds of fondue. The only thing that is lacking are fondue recipes in which the food does not cook in oil. I have a few recipes of my own in which the meat is cooked in broth and was looking forward to finding out more.
3,These are WEAVER MOUNT,"Hey Gang ... my mounts came today. They are exactly what I want ... except that they are Weaver Mount. See if you can find any mention in the listing or on any photograph that tells that these are Weaver. I will eat this one, since they don't say dovetail either. They don't say at all. Be aware that they are WEAVER."
5,Great Anime Series,This is onew of the best animes I've seen in a long time. I brought this on a hunch and it managed to lure me away from one of my favorite games when I started to watch it. I highly suggest you get it.
1,Just couldn't get into it,From the few pages that I read it links the similarities between warfare and political campaigning. The book just didn't spark any interest in the subject with me and came across as a mediocre history book.
1,Candy Claw machine loses it's grip.,This item looks good but within two passes it's claw stopped working. Not easy to fix if there is a problem.
1,Quality Control Issues No Stars More Appropriate!,"My first Claw Machine came with scratches on it, the sticker for up/down/etc. was upside down!! and the claw went 4 out of the 6 directions it was supposed to. I wrote the vendor and they sent another one. The second claw arrived and as I removed the twisty that holds the claw, the whole chain dropped. I also didn't receive the plastic coins for the second machine. Determined still I tried to fix machine 2 with the chain issue and simply could not. Very frustrating machine. If it does arrive ok, I'd imagine it won't stay that way.I got a refund and the company said they were filing a complaint with the manufacturor. No matter how much you love the Claw, Buyer Beware!!"
4,Cute!!,"I ordered this for Christmas for my 8 year old who is addicted to claw machines. I was able to find capsule toys on ebay. I was able to grab one on the first try. Oh dear, guess I better put it back in the box until Christmas. Hey, I just had to make sure it worked! It seems a little on the flimsy side, but for the price it sure makes a cute present."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"Similar to other reviews, I had difficulty with this product. It arrived on time but broken. I followed the return policy but the vendor did not accept my shipment. I had to re-send the item to the manufacturer for a replacement. I am still waiting. This was my daughter's favorite item on her Christmas list - a disappointment."
1,Poorly made,"I saw this at a freinds house and thought my grandchildren would like it. The chain on the Claw broke 1 minute after taking it out of the box.I had purchased two of them, one for my grandchildren and one for a coworker. My coworker reported that the claw would only go up and down and not left and right. Very disappointing."
1,Not happy at all.,This machine is very misleading. It was purchased as a gift for my 11 year old son for Christmas and to this day we still can't figure out how to get the claw to open to pick up the candy. I was not pleased with this item at all considering how much it costs.
1,candy crane machine,"i ordered this item in nov. as a christmas gift, when it was opened on christmas and filled with candy we discovered the chain on the crane itself was broken and would not work, i contacted them by phone and was told i would have areplacemnt item shipped out to me right away. nevered happened. my son was very disoppointed. and so was i."
5,Great for eating yogurt,"I bought two sets of these and sent another set to my sister. These are great for eating yogurt, getting peanut butter out of the bottom of a jar, getting jelly out of the bottom of a jar, and I could go on and on. The quality is great, the heavier weight is a real plus, and I'm more than pleased with them. Love the shell motif at the bottom of the handle."
1,Utterly Disappointing,"I've been a Grant Morrison fan For years, and have read a great amount of his work. Which is why I feel justified saying that this is easily the worst thing he's ever put his name on. Other than the dialogue between Batman and Grifter there is a complete void of characterization. Which is surprising considering the very human banter he had produced among all the numerous J.L.A issues he wrote. The plot is also very flat and atypical... this bland, fomulaic book. Let it be said that I was rather unhappy with my purchase. BE WARNED!!!"
1,a very pretentious team-up story...,"Grant Morrison writes very bizzare stories and this team-up with the JLA and the Wildcats is the strangest of all. You could read this five or six times and still not know what the story is or where it is going. If Morrison is a such a good writer, then why can't he write better comic scrips...?"
5,Fashions Fit for a Fairy Queen,"What a gorgeous book filled with gossamer wings and wispy things. I felt I was peeking into Queen Tatiana's closet; indeed, this is the wardrobe of royalty - a fairy fashion dreambook. Such a feast for artists, poets, fantasy lovers, and wee fashionistas of the sidh.*Fairie-ailty* is a large, hefty book - especially, considering the feathery lightness of its contents - and made of top quality materials. All the better to display the sumptuous beauty enclosed between its covers.The fairy finery on display are photos and etchings of gorgeous garments impeccably layered with beads and buttons and items from nature's bounty: flower petals, feathers, seeds, shells, etc.As a collagist and art lover, I give it my highest praise. My one complaint: I would not be able to fit into any of these little lovelies."
5,From a Graphic Designers Perspecitve,"I am not a Fairie expert at all but you do not need to be in order to find this book breathtaking.As you browse the pages you can hear yourself wishing you could be a Fairie - did I mention the voice you make this wish in is your childhood dream voice? This book takes you to places you forgot about, places adventerous and daring that used to only belong to the child of your past.I ordered this book to help get ideas for clients and got an adventure instead. I hope it is the same for you!"
1,Could have been better,"I thought i was going to get this amazing book based on other reviews. it was disappointing. It is more of a children's book with lots of interactive pages. i was hoping it was an art book that would show pictures and photos of clothes made in a fairy like resemblance. it's more of a card making or paper crafting book put together with some model drawings to show you what it could look like on a person. the artistry isn't that advanced, just layers of dried flowers and leaves, laid flat, and cut to look like clothes. i flipped through it quickly and then gave it to my 4 year."
1,I CAN'T BELIEVE !!,THAT'Z THE WACK'ST CD WHAT I EVER HEARD FROM VALLEJO !!!WACK-WACK-WACK-WACK-WACK-WACK-WACK-WACK..........
3,Less Is More,"In theory, the idea of an entire book devoted to the character I think everyone loves the most in the Elvis Cole novels is great. However by the time I finished I felt like the original recipe was better than the new. There's something about knowing too much about Joe that takes away his cool mystique. I don't want to see a tender side, and especially when it revolves around a character who seems to be spawned from the Paris Hilton school of heiress's. That's not to say the book isn't enjoyable and engaging, it is. It's just that it's a little like seeing the man behind the great and terrible Oz."
5,The best Robert Crais novel yet.,"If I could give this novel 6 stars, I would. I have read all of Robert Crais' novels and declare this is the best yet. He just keeps getting better and better. Joe Pike is one fascinating character and I am glad this novel focused more on him than any of the others. The other reviews will explain Pike so I'll just say, you won't be able to put this one down."
4,Joe Pike,"The mystery man that is always at Elvis's side finally has a whole book devoted to him! Not as much humor 'cause Joe ain't that kind of guy but a fast, well-told story non-the-less. Enjoyed it very much."
3,Middle of the road...,"I'll start off by saying that I have read every Elvis Cole book, most of them many, many times. I'd rate this one in the middle- certainly not as good as the last 3. First of all, the plot wasn't anything special. I don't want to give anything away, but if you're a fan of the series you'll see some similarities. Secondly, although it is billed as a Joe Pike novel, it reads very much like the last few. The author has been using the multiple points of view technique (chapters seen from different character's vantage- a chapter from Cole's eyes, a chapter from Pike's eyes) for several books now, and that same strategy is used here, only more from Pike.I liked the book- anything that furthers the characters is welcome- and I appreciated the fact that Cole was still healing from the last book and not up for any real butt=kicking- it just wasn't up to the standards set by LA Requiem or The Last Detective."
5,The Watchman: A Joe PIke Novel,Classic Robert Crais!! Classic Joe Pike!! Fast pace from page one and wondering who all the bad guys were up to the end. It's always facinating getting to know Joe layer by layer. Thank you Mr. Crais.
4,Amazon Kindle Books,"Joe Pike again foils the bad guys, the cliff hanger is how is going to do this and will something go wrong. Joe has as many turns as a country road. But he always gets his man."
5,The watchman (Joe Pike),"I love the Elvis Cole series and I'm especially fond of Joe Pike, so I was happy to read this book. There was a lot of interesting information about Joe that I did not get in the Elvis Cole books. This book is as good a read as any other that Robert Crais has written.(I have read them all). I could hardly put it down."
2,Dissappointing below average read,The story is WEAK! It rest on us believing that the bad guys are trying to kill a traffic accident witness in order to protect a 'secret' relationship between a bad guy and a money launderer. It just is illogical that they'd go through all this just to discredit an eyewitness!! It's like killing a fly with a bazooka! To make matters worse the characters are flat and unappealing. Frankly I was hoping the bad guys would kill her and end my misery so I didn't have to hear her whine anymore!!!Basically don't waste your time with this book.
2,OK Yarn - Wait for the Paperback version,"It's an OK story, but not worth all the hype and promotion. It would make a good paperback to set next to the can to read when you have the spare time."
4,Not as good as Harlen Coben but comprable!,"I enjoyed reading this book. It was recommended to me because I love reading Myron Boltaire. Writing style was similar, but it did not make me read it compulsively. I will however read more books by Robert Crais. I love the charater of Elvis Cole... I think Joe Pike was a little over the top."
2,Stopped Reading Near the End,"I'm a big fan of Crais, but this book just didn't do anything for me. It just seemed to go in circles, the circles centered on a whifty Paris Hilton clone. Joe Pike's okay, but I'm a much bigger Elvis Cole fan. I really don't think Pike is strong enough as a character to merit a whole book. In any case, I found the plot uncompelling and the story just seemed to drift. Crais is an uneven writer: sometimes he's up, sometimes he's down. In this one, he's down."
1,Not worth the time.,"This was my first Joe Pike and is likely to be my last. Not one likeable character, even Joe, to involve the reader.Joe keeps making really short sited decisions on what to do with the person he is protecting. Hey, how about flying with her to New York and living in a hotel for a few weeks? Too easy!The police are made out to be dumber than posts. Whenever things really jamb up, just bring on a new character with an easy solution.All together, a totally unrewarding experience. Try John Sandford for the right way to develop a macho character. Should have quit after the Kindle sample."
2,Seriously disappointing,"After reading all of the Elvis Cole novels I thought a Joe Pike novel would be great fun. It isn't. Rather its about Joe babysitting a stupid society brat who is full of herself. She has to hide, has almost been killed a couple of times and she is still whining that she wants to go home. Joe makes her cut and dye her hair but lets her keep wearing her $500 jeans. Please give me a break. She runs off to dance half naked on a table in a bar showing the dolphin tattoo on her butt. Surely somebody has to recognize the halfwit. Joe however forgives her. This isn't the Joe Pike we have seen in earlier pages. Lastly Joe actually falls in love with this piece of trash. Perhaps Crais thought we wanted to see a kinder gentler dumber Joe. He was wrong. Oh finally the plot is garbage equal to the rest of this disappointing effort."
2,Joe Pike is a supporting character,"Great supporting characters do not always make great lead characters. Joe Pike is a great supporting character, and one of the things that made him so is the sense of blank mystery he has in the earlier books by Robert Crais. Demystifying him, as happens to an extent here, makes him less impressive and less interesting.Elvis Cole, by contrast, is a better lead character than supporting character. The inner monologue that gives him so much life when he was the center of the book is here absent, and so we trade a lead character for a supporting one, and vice versa, and are worse off for both trades."
1,Am I the only one that thought this book was lame?,"I'm a huge fan of Detective, Spy, Ex-Military Hero type books, and really wanted to like this book because it was referred to me by a friend. However, it was one of the cheesiest books I've ever read. The characters are so transparent and artificial with one corny line after another. I couldn't help but think I was watching a tv show from the 80's that was cancelled after one uneventful season. The plot was pretty good, but again the description of the characters and the voice the author gave to each character was so completely lame and fake that it almost seemed as though the author was trying to write a spoof. I was really looking forward to starting another cool book series (like the Mitch Rapp - Vince Flynn; or Jon Smith - Covert One novels), but this will be the first and last Joe Pike book I ever read."
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Robert Crais and the Elvis Cole/Joe Pike series. I preordered this and, when it arrived, I expected to stay up all night reading. Instead, I found myself falling asleep after just a few pages. After the adrenaline rush of the first gun battle, I was bored, bored, bored with this story. Having read all of the previous titles in the series, I can't say that I learned anything new about either Joe Pike or Elvis Cole. The psycho babble between Joe and Larkin seemed forced and completely unbelievable to me. I really regret paying for this in hardcover. If you are a diehard fan of the series and have to read the book, I strongly recommend borrowing it from the library. I rated the book two stars only because I have enjoyed Robert Crais' other work too much to slight him with just one star."
4,Joe Pike is front and center,"Well done Mr. Crais. Nice to see Joe Pike front and center once again.Fun, fast read."
3,Fast paced,"Here we have the author's take on the action/conspiracy thriller. Rich girl sees something she shouldn't and after two failed murder attempts, a favour is called in and Joe Pike is brought in to protect her. After a couple more failed attempts, Pike brings in his partner Elvis and decides to take the fight to the bad guys. Not knowing who to trust, Pike decides to cut everybody out of the loop and do things his way.........This moves with pace and is, like all the author's novels, thrilling and entertaining with more then a few great one-liners thrown in. The focus here is more on Joe Pike then Elvis Cole and we see some flashbacks into his early Police years, all helping us to understand Pike's character.A slightly rushed ending, but good stuff from Crais once again."
4,the watchman,"The Watchman perhaps first provided the readers Joe Pike being the maincharacter in Rober Crais novels desides Elvis Cole, who yet this time plays an indespensable side role. I always enjoyed Robert Crais novels.I wanted to know if these novels are being translated in Japanese, as i amalmost sure the Japanese people would love to read this Joe Pike story as well as Elvis Cole story."
2,Ugh,"I've read all of Mr. Crais's books, and for the most part have been quite happy with the characters and plots. This thing seems to be either the manifestation of writers block or a contractual obligation left too late. So all you Elvis and Joe fans, you have no problem with the fact the the female lead is a fictionalized Paris Hilton? Or what happens with her and the other characters (trying not to be a spoiler here). The whole point of these type of books is to get a couple of inetersting and familiar characters and have them have an adventure. in this one, you can't really believe their actions, and the plot seems to be thrown together around the bad premise. Whatever, the guy has written some really good ones like ""Demolition Angel;"" this seems completely throwaway."
4,"Entertaining, Fun & Suspenseful","When I realized the young woman being protected by Joe Pike and Elvis Cole is a Paris Hilton type, I expected a superficial 2-star read, but this is a good book with a good plot and interesting characters."
4,The Watchman,"I like his style of writing, I like his plots and resolutions but he wanders in details and they become a bit tedious!"
5,"Dramatic, sucks you right in","This is a great book! Totally entertaining.I picked it up yesterday afternoon and finished it several hours later. Great diversion.Story has a fast moving plotline with lots of twists and turns. But it works. And feels 'real' - meaning it doesn't rely on completely outlandish, unbelievable events to keep the pace up (um, well, maybe there are a few that stretch credulity, but all in all, plausible).And the characters are vividly cast and interesting. They really come to life. Pike is a real man's man - yet has a sensitive side to him that helps round out the appeal. Even the Paris Hilton-lookalike is likeable as she turns out to have some substance as the story progresses."
4,This is Why Pike wears sunglasses even at night!,"I enjoyed this book very much, but one question that keeps coming up in the other reviews is why the lead character Joe Pike wears dark glasses all the time, even inside and at night. The answer to this was revealed in another Crais novel, L.A.Requiem, and it's not a big secret: Pike has excellent vision, even at night, and squints in the presence of bright lights inside and sunlight outside.There is a certain element of affectation, intimidation and image that goes with the wearing of the sunglasses, but in L.A. Requiem a genuine reason is given.If you liked The Watchman, you will probably like L.A. Requiem even more. It's not all about Pike but he has a much larger role in it than in the other Crais novels which mainly feature Elvis Cole.One star less than 5 for the plot of this one which was pretty fantastic and unrealistic, and for the unlikeability of the female lead character Larkin Barkely."
3,A PI Story,"This book was given to me as a gift by a friend. This is my first Robert Crais book. While the writing style is great, the plot is shallow."
5,Grabs You On Page #1.......,"This is typical Robert Crais-AWESOME! I purchased this book the day it come out. I was in the middle of reading a different book, but I decided I would tease myself and read the first page of The Watchman. I couldn't put it down!A fantastic story, that builds the suspense and pressure until the books memorable conclusion! I read this book in one day! The only regret I have is, having to wait another full year until the next Robert Crais novel comes out. Thank you for an amazing experience Mr. Crais!"
4,The Watchman,"Typical of a Joe Pike novel, the pace is fast and the characters interesting. Crais nails it again with one you don't want to put down."
5,"Strong,silent type a winner","Ladies, start your engines. Have you been longiing for a tall, strong and silent type of guy to come along and take you away? The kind of guy who would protect you from all dangers? The kind of guy Gary Cooper, John Wayne and Clint Eastwood built careers on? Then Joe Pike is your man.As a long time fan of Elvis Cole, I often wondered what Joe Pike was like. Now I know. He is just as I imagined. A man of few words, resolute in action. A great book."
4,Great read,"Lots of action from start to finish. The characterization in this is very good. The storyline has already been covered, I'll just say that you definitely should pick it up."
3,I Love Pike But Was Disappointed,"I looked forward to reading this novel. The beginning is interesting but, I was bored in the middle. At the end, I found the actions taking place confusing. I still don't know why the people in the story were killed. Joe Pike is a great character. I don't know what the attraction was for the female lead. I would think Joe would be attracted to a sweeter and better person. Elvis had a small part in this novel and he's always funny. It took me much longer to read this novel than any other Robert Crais book. I kept putting it down and not picking it up. Basically, the story is not that interesting."
4,Excellent book,"Great book, lots of insight into Joe Pike, although I liked my private views of Joe better."
3,Required Item,"Needed it for my father-in-law, it shipped directly to his house, this was an item not covered by his medical insurance, but required."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I've read and enjoyed Franz Bardon's books on hermetics but after reading this story, I'm beginning to doubt the veracity of his other books. This book reads like a fantasy written by a ten-year-old for a ten-year-old. If this story really is an autobiography of Franz Bardon (which I highly doubt)I'd have to file his other books under fantasy and fiction."
3,Bardon Idealized,"Although Bardon's instructional books are, arguably, the best on the occult market, I cannot say that Frabato is of the same quality. Actually, it is important to note that this book was not actually written by Bardon, but by one of his students. Clearly, Bardon was idealized in Frabato (Frabato having been his stage name while he was travelling). Sadly I cannot recommend this to individuals looking for a good read. On the other hand, Bardonofiles may enjoy it, as it does offer some insight into the man, as well as offer an entertaining, if grossly exagerated view of Bardon."
2,A Bit Like A 30's Serial,"Frabato (Bardon) battles the Evil Lodge on the eve of WWII. This book is written in a ""Flash Gordon Vs. The Cosmic Meanies"" style, further fractured through the services of a bad translator. If this is Bardon in action, then imagine a scratchy sound track, really evil bad guys in black suits and top hats, and the ultimate good guys being Koot Hoomie and His Ascended Masters gliding to the rescue on flying carpets. Bardon's secretary wrote this one and I really believe she was planning to farm this script out to Fritz Lang. At most, quaint, at worst, a disappointment to anyone seeking enlightenment on the Hermetic front."
4,Totally engrossing,"Well, id like to say that i got home from work and saw my amazon.com package waiting for me. I opened frabato the magician at about 4pm...after reading one chapter of this book i proceeded to lock the door. Turn the phone off, make some food and read this book to the finish. This book is such an outstanding view of what a true Hermetic magician can do. It gives any student of the art real inspiration to strive to always do more and be stronger. I found this ""novel"" to be enjoyable on many levels and i would recommend this to any Hermetic student."
4,exactly what I expected,"I read this book from cover to cover as soon as it came in the mail. Although I am very satisfied with it and found it a very interesting ready, I have one minor complaint. It spends very little (if any) time on Hitler and the Third Reich. I do think that this is a good inspirational read, and the first stepping stone to anyone who is seriously interested in Hermetics."
4,"Only 10 songs, but they're good ones.","10 all out rockers are present in this collection of Winter's best covers. From ""Johnny B. Goode"" to ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" Winter shows no fear when covering some of rock's greatest tunes. His searing guitar and howling vocals are up to the test. The main knock against this set is its brevity. At a little over 35 minutes you know this is an early CD, but until a comprehensive box set does this artist justice it will have to do."
1,so so mount,"I bought this mount for a 26inch LCD. This mount is NOT designed to hold a 26"" set. It was sagging under the weight of the TV with the everything tightened to the maximum. I would not recommend this mount!"
3,Crash Up,"I think that my son will love this toy, but it is very difficult to assemble. The pieces are numbered, but do not lock into each other very well. It looks like a lot of fun (we just received it this weekend), but I am not sure of the quality."
4,Lots of Fun,Fun toy - my sons love it - easy to use for the younger kids since you just shake cars. Folds to store. Glad we bought it!
1,Do not buy - not worth the frustration,"The cars don't hold battery power, they go for half the track and die, and the track constantly falls apart. It's frustrating to put together and not worth the money at all."
1,Jinx are losers,"I purchase this through ""Jinx"" a company Amazon I guess allows to sell through them and I am in a claim right now because of a missing part that they refuse to take care of. They have no clue what customer service is and barely grasp English which of course adds to the enjoyment in dealing with idiots. I would not purchase this item through Amazon via Jinx or if something goes wrong prepare to except the shaft."
2,Crappy track,"We gave this to our three kids last year for Christmas, and what a waste of money. The track falls apart if you even just look at it funny. I give two stars because my boys love to 'shake 'n' go' the cars on the kitchen floor. The track is in a box in the basement, and this year they're getting Geotrax and Hot Wheels."
4,"Fun track, duds for cars","We love this track, but it does take up quite a bit of space. I do like that when disassemble the parts are larger and not easy to loose. My son gets frustrated that the cars seem to loose their ""go"" quickly. We tried new batteries and it didn't seem to change. Overall though it's a good toy for our 3 year old."
2,another race track that doesn't work,"Another race track that's hard to put together, doesn't stay together, and the cars don't stay on the tracks. This one is worse than most because the cars only run for a very short time (no matter how you shake them)."
1,This toy is worthless,"This is the worst toy I have ever bought. We tried for over an hour to put it together. It would have been easy, but the pieces would not stay together at all. We were never able to get all the pieces snapped together. Just a horrible experience on Christmas morning. We will be returning it asap. Don't waste your time or money. I have never seen a toy that was built so poorly."
2,Aggravates Mom,"This was a wonderful idea however, after I put the track together for the fifth time in 10 minutes it lost it's appeal. When he cars hit it the track comes apart and it can't be moved with out having to reassemble most of it."
3,There are better racetracks available...,"Definately dificult to put together - use supergluse before you let the kids play with it. The cars are a bit ""fragile"" for a rambunctious 4 yr old. Not nearly as much ""fun"" as the TV ad... I'd suggest you check out the Cars race track - it's one complete set - no assemly required - so it doesn't come apart and the cars go much faster.... Would I buy this again? Probably not - but it was exactly what my son asked for so in the end, he was pleased and that's all that really matters."
3,A pain to put together,"The racetrack is great, but it was a total pain to put together. The instructions are in black and white and are poor. The numbers and letters beneath the tracks are difficult to locate. It's not the most durable either. Once the cars start to go around the tracks separate from each other. Other than my own adult complaints, my son just loves it!"
2,Doesn't live up to it's hype,My 7 year old son REALLY wanted this for Christmas and it was nighmare to put together. My kids played iwth it for 20 minutes and then it fell apart and hasn't been touched again for weeks now. Definitely not worth the money we paid for it. Huge disappointment. The cars don't drive for very long either and for some reason it was hard to get them to crash.
2,Cars = great! Track = Meh,"Well, our almost 5 year-old son loved the cars but the track was very disappointing. Like others have stated, VERY difficult to put together and even harder to STAY together. Then, after (constantly) ensuring all track is nice and tight/level, the ""action"" lasts...5 seconds. ??? The longest the cars stayed ""active"" was two laps and then they quit, with or without a crash. Honestly, we couldn't get the cars to crash more than 1 of every 10 times.Soooo, son made the best of things and just played/crashed/smashed them together. He thinks that's cool (whew!). Dad here sure is grateful that the cars are robust and when crashed together are pretty cool.CARS = 5 StarsTRACK= 0 Stars"
4,wow - what fun,Wow - what an incredibly fun toy this is! - We have spent hours playing with the cars - although my wife does find them a little noisy the boys love them.hours of fun - and great value.
4,Takes a while to assemble!,"A heads up for Christmas morning: put it together ahead of time! It took me over a half hour to assemble with three frustrated, trying to be ""helpful"" boys looking on. I'm not sure the excitement will be long-lived, but it's what my 4 year-old really wanted for his birthday. His 7 & 9 year-old brothers are having fun with it too."
2,Several problems right out of the box.,"From reading the reviews you can see it is really mixed. Assembly was made far more difficult than neccessary (the screws were not needed and hard to put in the deeper holes). A snap together design would have worked much better. One car ran only twice, then never worked again on new batteries. The one car that did work rarely could make one lap. The car also had problems with the ramps, the plastic wheels would start to spin and it could not make the hills. There are jumps, but the car rarely does a jump with any success. It never mattered how often the car was shaken, it went about the same distance. This is a hard item to ever return due to the assembly issues. It is difficult to ever get back in the same box. I am really surprised that this low of quality came from Fisher-Price. However, reading some of the reviews gives me the feeling that there are multiple versions of this toy out there."
2,Poor Quality,"This item was unfortunately a disappointment. I think the idea itself is great, but the end product is not. As others have noted, the ramp does not fit and was useless. As every review does not mention this, I assume it may be manufacturing lot related. However, on the one I purchased the ramp is 1/2 inch narrower that the space its intended to snap into per the poorly written directions.The parts do not snap together firmly, and continued to come apart each time a car ran the course. In reading past reviews, others have apparently had to resort to tape and super glue to hold this thing together.I've never written an Amazon review before, but the dismal quality of this product and excessive price for what you get made me want to hopefully keep others from wasting their money. Buyer beware."
3,Disappointing,My 4 year old son was very excited to get this racetrack. The problem was that the tracks did not connect properly. They kept popping back up which made the cars unable to move around the track.
4,grandson's third birthday,"I bought this for my grandson's third birthday and it was a big hit... All the children took turns playing with it.. I love the fact you can buy different cars for the shake and go... I bought one for my other grandson for Christmas. I know he will love it , He loved his cousins..."
3,Should have read review more!,"I bought this for my 2 year old for Christmas. Him and my 7 year old love to shake the cars up, but the track never stays together long enough to run them around the track very long. I love the cars that come with it, but uggg. The track was kind of a pain to put togehter in the first place. Yes I used the screws that came with it, but those don't keep the track together. EVERY time my son pulls down the lever to get the cars to race the track comes apart. Bottom line track sucks but the cars are cool. Would I buy it again....probably. That's because I know my kids love toys for 5 days then they move on, its worth the WOW that the track gets when it is together."
4,Great Toy!,"This is a great product! We had no problem putting it together, and unlike previous reviews have had no issues with the track falling apart during use. We have a 4 and a 2 year old boys and both of them have loved playing with the cars. I would recommend this toy to anyone!"
4,"fun toy, but takes up a lot of space","Great tough toy. Cars don't always make it around the track without crashing into the corners. My only two complaints is that the cars only run for a limited time, even when you shake it for a minute or so and leaving the track assembled takes up a lot of room. The Plus side the track has been stepped on many time with no issues and dogs have run off with cars to be chewed and bark at, yet everything has worked time and time again. The assemply isn't hard if you can read. I am happy with the buy"
5,Hardy & Fun,"This speedway works just as promised - only better! Our grandson, his dad and grandpa ( & ME!!!) spent hours playing with this! Additionally, these cars travel pretty much anywhere the surface is smooth! Great fun for ALL ages!!! Very much recommended!"
3,The track is weak,"The track is supposed to snap together pretty easily, once everything is screwed together. That hasn't been my case. The track starts to come apart after only a few of the cars' revolutions. I've decided I'm going to have to super glue this thing together. If the track can stay snapped together, this can be a very fun toy.That said, my son loves playing with the cars and seeing them crash. They hold up as great stand-alone toys, without the track."
2,Track Does Not Stay Together,"My son received this toy as a present for his fourth birthday. Not only was it difficult to assemble, (and I consider myself an accomplished track builder) but it would not stay together. Everytime my son ran the cars the track came apart. It was frustrating for him as well as us. Eventually, we ended up gluing the track together, but it still separates, making it difficult for the cars to run. It's a shame, because my son really does love the shake-n-go concept, he has the orginal track. And, he does love it when the track stays together. If this was not a gift, I would have returned it."
1,Bad quality,"The blanket is very cheap looking and bad quality printing. It has paint spots from manufacturer. The fabric is kind of scratchy and NOT feeling silky soft, not reversible. Also made in China not Korea as it states. Doesn’t show what material it’s made of, by touching feels 100% Polyester and not acrylic. I am very disappointed."
3,I did not like the quality,"The product was the right color and design, however the quality was not what I had imagined. The seller is very professional and took care of the return immediately. I will not recommend this particular item to anyone but I will absolutely purchase from this seller again!"
4,soft and warm,"my daughter liked her new blanket. it fit her standard sized bed just fine. this is a good, plush blanket however it still wasnt as plush and nice as the mink blanket given to me from a friend who moved out of the country."
4,good read,"Well I just have to say that I liked this book, no matter how corny it is (husband and wife falling in love a good few years after marriage) No, it's not good literature, but it passes some hours."
4,Rise to the occasion,"I purchased this book as documentation for a paper I am writing on bread in history. I already have The History of Bread by B. Dupaigne, and English Brad and Yeast Cookery by E. David, and World Sourdoughs by E. Wood. This book gives a unique perspective on the common man and his bread thru history. It does stand alone, but is a lovely companion to those I already have."
1,Tedious,"After reading glowing reviews of this book, I was surprised at how tedious it actually is...The beginning was quite interesting, but it soon became encyclopedic and almost felt like it was copied from old manuscripts..(it probably was)...could not stay with it...too boring."
5,Should be Required Reading Before Marriage,"Although I'm not fininshed reading this book, it's been pretty amazing so far. Fulton Sheen has such a poignant way of writing. As someone else stated, it's not difficult reading, but each line is rich and meaty, and requires some thought and digestion. I find myself highlighting every other sentence on my Kindle. As someone who didn't see a successful marriage growing up, I now feel like I understand what a marriage is supposed to look like--not the Hollywood version that is based on superficiality and sex--but something deeper based on a mutual love of God. Both the husband and wife should love God more than the other, which provides the soil, the FOUNDATION for their mutual love to grow and flourish. The book is just so rich! This should be required reading for couples before they say ""I do."""
5,Amazing book!,"I'm soon to be married in the Catholic Church, and I find this book absolutely fabulous! It's so plum thick of material, that I can't read more than a few pages at a time. But it's worth it! Truly a testament to the beauty God has given us in marriage and love. Life-changing!"
5,still waiting,"This may have been a December purchase, but I'm still waiting for it at the end of January. I anticipate being thrilled when it finally arrives, as this replaces a worn out tape of the same album, a long time favorite."
5,The best romance novel of the decade still in print.,"Barbara Michael's ""Search the Shadows"" is undoubtedly thebest romance novel written in the past decade. Whileblatantly escaping all references to real problems, suchas drugs, overpopulation, the economy, etc., Ms. Michaelsmanages to remind us of the very hidden truths that canbe found even in the most obvious of plots, but whichbecome apparent only at the end. Without giving theending away, we see that the main driving force for manyof the events that occur in the story is, of course, greed,and villains become heroes just before your eyes. A MUST!"
3,seemed tedious instead of suspenseful,"I've read and enjoyed many of Barbara Michael's books, but this one just never seemed to pick up much momentum until the climax of the story. Part of it maybe was that there were too many sorta possible love interests, and none seemed to have any chemistry with the heroine. The story was rather tedious to me, and I admit I got bored and started skimming a third of the way through. I prefer the author's stories that are more suspenseful with more atmosphere."
4,A good read,"An interesting, absorbing mystery. Not always psychologically believable, but always diverting, and isn't that the point?"
4,Barbara Michaels's books are fun and enjoyable to read!,"I'm always turning pages quickly when I read one of her books. Sometimes the endings can be a little disappointing, simplistic, but it's great fun ride along the way. The book made me wish I knew and was reading about Leah, the mother, even more so than the daughter."
5,Always funny,"There is no other way to say it. Garfield is always funny, no matter which book it is. I love them all. They are always good for a laugh."
5,GARFIELD RULES!,I did it! I just reviewed all 36 of Garfield's comic strip books! All these books are great and everybody should collect them! Garfield is the best! Check 'em out!
3,Not as good as the others,"Once again the funniest fat cat ever comes out with another book. Unfortunatley, it doesn't measure up to the others. I have been a big Garfield fan for at least 8 years, and this is the worst book yet. Luckily it's still pretty good. All the old jokes are reused again and again. Jim Davis needs to come up with some new jokes for the fans."
5,a great book,This Garfield book was great just liked all the rest of them. I think Garfield is just as funny now as he was 20 years ago. I don't like people like bret herholz who think he isn't funny anymore.
3,Info on the book.,"Alexandra is a girl still in school. When she was a child, something horrible happened that gave her psychic powers. Now as a teenager, she has a vision of things to come. Then the murders start taking place. She and her friend s are thrown into a world of prophecy and cults."
1,Horrible - Deserves no stars,"I bought this kit and it simply doesn't work. The kit comes with six tests and two pregnancy tests. Since I have never taken a pregnancy test or fertility prediction test, I took one of the prediction tests, just to be accustomed to the procedure before I actually would test for real, I assumed the results would be negative. The test came out invalid, not negative. Thinking maybe I did something wrong, I decided to take another one later and that one came out invalid too. I followed the directions, which aren't that difficult to follow, precisely. A negative I would understand but invalid twice? This kit is a waste of money, don't buy it."
3,Book was fairly helpful,"This book was helpful although I expected more from it considering it was from Consumer Reports. I find their magazine to contain more up-to-date, detailed information and to be more helpful. If I had to do it over again, I may not have purchased this book."
2,Weak,Overall the content of this book was lacking. It provided a very high level overview of the various products but information was not practical for actual shopping. A lot of it is due to the nature of consumer reports where they test just a few models - and there are so many models and they change so quickly in this industry that much of the information seemed dated. I later purchased the 'baby bargains' book and would HIGHLY recommend that over this one. Baby Bargains had manufacturer reviews that discussed things such as value for the money and customer service in addition to product reviews and consumer feedback.
1,Waste of Money,"My wife and I bought the ""pack"" (both CR & Baby Bargins). We tried looking through CR first but, like the other comments, it's not like the mag. It gives you info like, ""If your lifestyle is this, you should look for these characteristics in the product."" But it doesn't tell you what products. Baby Bargains is way better."
3,Good Resource but Not Nearly as Good as Baby Bargains,"I got this book with ""Baby Bargains"" and found myself ditching this one almost the entire time I was coming up with my registry. That's not to say that the book is no good. I did use it on occasion to confirm that the items suggested in Baby Bargains were actually considered safe. But for a first time parent, it tells you the ratings of different brands, but doesn't actually say ""buy this one"", which Baby Bargains does. So, if you want information on the safety and performance of different brands, I highly recommend this book. But if you want someone to tell you what to buy, try another book."
4,Great Resource (Especially when I am unable to travel to stores),I found the book to be a great asset. I do not live near stores. So I am unable to check out baby products first hand. A friend recommended this book to me. I have made decisions based on the book's recommendations. I appreciate being able to turn to the book for advice on what is the best baby product. It does not have all baby products that I would like but enough to make the purchase worthwhile.
3,Not so great,"I expected this guide to give recommendations. Each chapter was quite brief, however, and didn't delve much into the actual pluses and minuses of the different products. Many of the products weren't even tested; they just gave a listing with the manufacturer's write-up. I found Baby Bargains by Denise and Alan Fields to be a lot more useful."
3,Not Great,"I would not recommend this book because the information it provided is readily available on the internet. I was hoping to find more specific recommendations for specific products. Instead, the majority of the items are defined and safety features are suggested without the specific products listed that have all of those things."
2,Not much to report ...,"I was disappointed. The book provides a lot of information on ""how to buy"" (buying guides), but little information on ""WHAT to buy"" (recommended brands). Most items are NOT actually tested/reviewed ... the book merely provides a list of brands available - which I could get by walking into any baby store. Hoping 9th Edition is more complete."
2,Where are the reports,"I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. Very few of the items are actually reviewed, most don't have any listing of their features AND in the book they tell you the items that are reviewed CR didn't even evaluate themselves! A complete waste of $15."
4,A good guide for new parents,"I'm due in a couple months but have already completed my baby registry. After reading this book, I ended up having to re-do my registry, delete items, add items, change items. I've been looking for a buying guide like this and not even any of the parenting websites I visited has as much useful information as this book has. I think it is an excellent guide for new parents that feel overwhelmed when it comes to shopping for baby products. After all, you don't want to go buy looks and price alone.Just keep in mind though that this book rates only the essentials and that not all the items they discuss are actually rated. But at least the book makes recommendations based on safety factors.But the best thing I learned from this book was that just because an item is expensive, it doesn't mean it's the best or safest product for your baby."
1,"DON""T BUY IT!","Buy 'Baby Bargins' instead!!!! I looked at this book at Barnes and Nobel, but didn't buy it. Only a few products were reviewed.....and the reviews weren't very good. Also, only a few categories were reviewed. The baby bargins book has detailed reviews on all brands in several categories."
1,Very disappointed,This book won't help you at all. I don't even want to give it a star. I would recommend The lilaguide: Baby Gear Guide and Baby Bargains.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this book along with Baby Bargains, and expected Consumer Reports to be the better book, as I'm a fan of their website and magazines. I assumed it would be packed with quantitative information and instead found short chapters mainly capped by a list of manufacturers, with product descriptions culled directly from the manufacturers. There is very little objective information on safety or any other factor. Try Baby Bargains instead - it's packed with great explanations of which features are important as well as ratings on EVERYTHING."
1,not what i thought,i thought this book woudl give some color on the various baby products as well as provide some product info. it did neither. it was a lean description of outdated prodcuts and an incomplete list of products as well.
4,Worth the money,"As usual Consumer Reports has lots of useful information. I kept this book by my side as I registered for my baby shower on-line. Definitely helped me make some decisions as a first time mother. However, I was disappointed that most items had info but not their usual rating list reflecting field tests that CR is so famous for..."
1,dissapointed,this book is a collection of old newspaper and magazine articles. ENTIRE BOOK IS IN BLACK AND WHITE. No good photos.
3,Good>>Okay,"It's a nice book for people moving into finance. Yet I would suggest this book only if you have fundamental knowledge of accounting. This book overlooks many of the accounting basics. Moreover, I would suggest the similar book which is used in MBA studies because that book has more number of chapters and deals with many more interesting stuff in finance which are left out in this book."
4,A must have as part of drinking water purification,"One liter of clear water (filtered as best as you can) 5 drops of purifier per liter, mix for 10 seconds, let sit for 5 minutes and its ready or add your favorite drink mix and drink away. This purifier is part of the Sweet Water Purification system and should be replaced per the instructions included. The 4 stars are for the smell, it makes the water smell like clorox. It does NOT add any flavor to the water that I have noticed. Two fluid ounces, about the weight of the same amount of water, so it is very easy to carry. It goes where my water purifier goes."
1,Nice song quanity but poor quality.,I give this a star for the pipe /drummers interest but zero for the rest. This is in my top five worse pipe/drum CD's that I have purchased (close to a 100).It sounds like a total computerized fabrication with uneven sound and rhythm. Some of the songs are hardly recognizable and the rhythm would be impossible to cadence to.This Cd was not put together by respectful musicians. If you're looking for pipe music with band or symphonic accompaniment check out the Royal Scots Guards for starters.
5,the best in chill to date,this is hands down the BEST in chillout I have ever heard. from the opening song to the end it is all quality. the two best are afterlife and mandalays tracks. the bush song is a nice change of pace from them. if this is your first chillout cd or you are just looking for a new one this is a definate must have.
1,Monster Ripoff,"First off, HDMI is a digital standard. ANY cable that allows the signal to be turned on and off (think light switch or telegraph) will work. You don't need special gold conductors etc. anymore than the telegraph operators of 1880 did!!Monster made its name decades ago selling better speaker cables to audiophiles willing to pony up big bucks. Even then, tests at very advanced labs showed that cheap lamp cord from the hardware store performed as well for 99.9% of listeners, but Monster prevailed. Good for them I guess as there's one born every minute you know.The bottom line is that a $2 HDMI cable will work just as well as this cable assuming no conductors are broken. Do a search on any AV forum for cheap cables and you will find a web site where you can buy 5-10 HDMI cables for this price and toss out any you feel aren't working for you."
5,Fills my needs perfectly.,Provides a beautiful picture and sound from my Blu-ray player to my TV and audio system. This product meets my needs and I have yet to see or hear any flaws.
5,Great cables....no reason to pay $80 at Best Buy,"great cables, quick shipping, for only $27, 1/3 of the cost of the same cable at Best Buy normally $80. Highly recommended."
4,The Bread for Life Diet,"Clearly written, informational, easy to follow diet plan for a few weeks or for a lifetime. I've only just begun the diet, it certainly works as far as being easy and economical to follow. Not hungry or craving sweets or anything else. Too early to measure weight loss. But because I love sandwiches, this may be a plan for me forever anyway!"
1,Unhealthy diet,"If you burn more calories than you ingest, you will lose weight.So the Bread for Life Diet CAN help people to lose weight.However, it'll remain a most unhealthy diet for A LOT of people. For diabetic and prediabetic, it comes to self-poisoning. It's far too high carb.Be careful. Educate yourself."
3,Eve,"Eve Boswell was most known for her hit novelty song, ""Pickin' a Chicken."" Despite this the majority of the songs on this cd are standards and ballads. But Eve's voice stands out most on the poppy songs like Chicken, Sugar Bush, and Little Shoemaker.I liked a few of the other numbers though. She does an serious version of Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo which strangely works and the over dramatic The Bridge of Sighs is another good song. Her cover of On the Waterfront has a gothic feel to it."
1,Dont use in Northern US,"My 1 star is actually for Amazon.com. I have no idea how this product performs. I guess that if you look at the back of the box, it has a map of the United States and the bottom half uses this product. The top half uses Octenol, a different chemicle. I wish Amazon would have told me this because now I am stuck in New York with a product that will not do me any good. Amazon wants me to pay for return shipping, and will deduct the original ""free"" shipping charges, all because of their mistake.1 star for amazon."
2,packaged damaged/opened,"the package was open/damaged a bit, not to the point of unusable. not sure if it was the shipper."
1,Mosquito Magnet Plus is a BIG MINUS,"CAN'T WE GIVE A NEGATIVE RATING....ONE STAR IS WAY TOO HIGH A RATING.After several emails and faxes of diagrams of the house, gazebo, deck and back yard, wind direction and questions, the MM people said that by changing the attractant to the Lurex, we would see results, something that hasn't happened in three years of attempts....and, after over a monthof the new attractant, the mosquitos are still biting, the net is empty and we are several hundred dollars of misspent funds lighter.The attractant DOES NOT ATTRACT."
3,Puzzled...,"I'm in South Texas - an area defined by Mosquito Magnet as being one where the Lurex attractant is supposed to be the more appropriate - but my catch rate has gone way down since switching to this from their Octenol attractant. I think I'm going back. With all the rain a month ago we've got no shortage of mosquitoes, but they're mostly the little-ones - and I don't think they find this Lurex stuff as appealing."
1,"This product does not work in the Washington, DC area.","I have tried to get this product and the mosquito magnet to work at my home in the Washington, DC area for two years without sucess. The Asian tiger mosquitos fly around the , but are not caught. I am very dissapointed, especially since the mosquit magnet is very expensive, and I have a lot of mosquitos in my yard. I would recommend that you do not purchase this product if you have Asian tiger mosquitos.Thank you for your time."
1,Mosquitoes in South Texas,"This is probably a very good product in other parts of the country, but after extensive use, it does not work in South Texas."
3,sub par,This is not the product that I thought I was ordering.. . . It works ok but doesent attract all of the misquitos that it claims to.
4,Works well,For Texas mosquitos with the magnet machine. Just be reminded that the lifetime of these cells are limited. But work well.
1,Mosquitos still biting,"Mosquito Magnet Lurex3-OD-3 Biting Insect Attractant: This product is inserted into the Mosquito Magnet to attract mosquitos, especially the type of mosquitos we have in Texas. I ran it all last summer and have it turned on this spring, but so far I haven't seen a good result,-very few bugs caught in the trap. I think the unit would probably work fine under perfect conditions, i.e., right placement, no wind, plenty of sunshine, but it's hard to set it up exactly right and get cooperation from the wind and sun. My friend has two units and has given up trying to make them work. I am about to do the same."
5,delightful look into a preschool classroom,"This is a funny, thoughtful collection of young children's conversations compiled over the course of a year. The teacher's observations and reflections helped me rethink the conversations I hear in my own classroom."
4,Good Learning Tool,"Overall I am happy with this book. One feature that I really like are the small translation dictionary sections in the back of the book. They go both ways (from English to Italian and from Italian to English). The book gives you a small batch of nouns, verbs, and adjetives in each section. It's a great book for the price."
3,Well intentioned book marred by typos,"This book covers all the basics of the Italian language within the written context of a ""love story"" between an American salesman and an Italian teacher. The story is very modern- you will learn the words of technical items. Italian geography, culture, and weather are also covered, within the context of the stories. The only problem is the typographical errors. Even the answer key was marred by typos and omissions. That's ashame, because this would have been a great introduction to the Italian language."
3,NEEDS MORE ORAL PRACTICE,"I FOUND THE ORDER OF THE LESSONS CONFUSING. THE EXERCISES SEEMED OUT OF ORDER. THE READING SHOULD COME FIRST AND THEN THE NEW PHRASES, BECAUSE THE EXERCISES NEEDED MORE EXPLANATION. THERE IS NO ORAL PRACTICE."
1,Had to get it elsewhere.,"Five days after I paid for the item, there was a notice that the book was on backorder. I had told them that I needed it for a class. I then ordered it on Ebay and got it quickly."
4,Breaking the mold,"I was shocked when I read a negative review of this album where the reviewer said there weren't any hit singles from it. Well, the same goes for Sgt. Pepper, and like that, ""Something Happening"" is a fantastic album. This is where the Raiders made the transition from bubblegum pop to hard rock, and they deftly straddle both sides of that fence. Here, there's sappy stuff like ""Happens Every Day"" and ""Observation from Flight 285"" side by side with hard rockers like ""Get out of my Mind"" and ""Communication."" In between, we've got perfect pop gems like ""Too Much Talk,"" ""Burn Like a Candle"" and the TV show themes. As much as I love the stuff with Fang, Drake & Smitty, this album is leaps and bounds ahead of ""Spirit of '67."""
1,Nice try but falls very short of a quality album,"This album is an attempt by Mark Lindsay to be taken seriously in the rock world, and he fails. He still has one foot in the world of bubblegum, and the other foot in the land of cliches and hippie axioms. This album did not age well, and sounds hopelessly out of date."
1,LE CDR,"THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM WITH SUPER MUSIC BUT THE COPIES HERE ARE RECORDED ON CDR'S SO THEY SKIP OR STOP DEAD IN MY CD PLAYER.THE ONLY SAFE LEROUX CD OUT IS ""UP"" ON THE ROCK CANDY LABLE OR THE JAP IMPORTS."
3,"2 great songs, but rest of album stinks!","I bought this on cassette when it first came out in '83 and I got to say that it's not very good. Lifeline is awesome, one of my all-time favorite songs, Carrie's Gone is also very good, but after that the album suffers severely! I give it three stars for those two songs alone because two stars claims I don't like it."
5,Nice To See The Original Cover Back On It!,Sorry the original credits were not included and...no liner notes...but still great to get this on CD with the original cover!
5,AWESOME,"WAAAAAAAAY better deal than my local auto parts store, local place wanted over $37.00 for one of these. Very good price for brand new under $13.00 go get it now."
4,Excellent,"I ordered this as the tune at the end of the film is haunting and stays with one all day. However, I find the music on the CD is more ""Modern Classical"" than I remember from the film. It could be rated on a par with John Williams or Karl Jenkins. Therefore all the more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Sound quality is a wee bit uneven as some tracks are quiet so turning up the sound for them, then makes it too loud for some of the other tacks. Its a CD that sits in a pile near my computer so that I can play it on my portable CD player when working on the computer and there's nothing of interest on the radio. Well worth the money and the trouble of ordering it from the USA as I don't think its available in Britain. Chris Walker"
2,So close to plagiarism,"Although I enjoyed the movie a great deal, I wondered throughout what Riuichi Sakamoto must have thought when he heard the score. It is so much like--blatantly so, down to the key and choice of instrumentation--the Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence soundtrack that I am surprised there hasn't been a court case involving the two scores....or has there? Maybe the two composers are old friends and they really don't mind."
2,Spirited Away from what?,"This CD is only music, no lyrics. Makes it kinda hard to enjoy the songs from the movie with my child."
4,Deeply Moving...,"Joe Hisaishi's work has always been eccletic, a cross between Japanese modal tones and western neo-classicalism, synthesizer and quiet piano. This album demonstrates Hisaishi's growth as a composer and truly ranks as his best. Meaning his best, being better than Mononoke with its quiet and longing tone and its simple melodies. They really work well with the exploits of little Chihiro and the strange ghost world where her adventures take place. I feel truly blessed that Hisaishi's work (along with Hayao Miyazaki's) is being showcased here in the States. They both are truly at the top of there game, and get this: Miyazaki is a legend in his homeland but almost completely unknown here. I hope Miyazaki continues to bring his films over to the USA."
5,Joe Hisaishi is excellent as always.,"I've loved all of Joe Hisaishi's work, especially for the Miyazaki films. The music in Castle in the Sky and Howl's Moving Castle are masterful, but Spirited Away is my all time favorite of the bunch. Even my 11-year-old brother, who detests all music classical, loves this CD."
2,Not happy with this produce,"The hair dryer is not as I have expected. I got it yesterday and had all intention to return it. However, after reading the restocking fees and shipping cost I decided it is cheaper to keep it. I will never buy a product without checking it out first.1. The hair dryer is LOUD. I need to use ear plugs when using it.2. The instruction is very brief.3. It is not easy to attach the brushes4. The dual voltage changes need to use a screwdriver to go inside of the product-too troublesome for me.I should have got a hair dryer from Sally Supplies paying a little more. The sales clerks were very knowledgeable. Instead, I am buying a pig in a poke and having buyer remorse. My last hair dryer lasted 35 years. I wanted to donate this one out already."
1,Chomsky reruns,"Boldly rehashing his same old provably wrong and elitist theories, Chomsky tries to cash in on his name from the lingusitics world. As a political analyst, his views are elitist, undemocratic, anti-religious. Send this book back to Russia."
1,Anti-American leftirst,"Mr. Chomsky, a widely famous leftist, is also known as a supporter of global Arab fascism and anti-Semitism. All his books on Middle East are based on his profound ignorance of the Middle East history, twisting the facts, and hate of the state of Israel, our only true ally in the region. Instead of this book, I highly recommend ""The Anti-Chomsky Reader"" edited by Peter Collier and David Horowitz."
5,Genesis: Three Sides Live on DVD,I'd love to see this great classic concert footage of the great Phil Collins & his great band Genesis get released onto DVD!!!
4,Good fun,"I've been waiting for this for some years, but now I have it I am enjoying the games.I hope others will have fun also."
5,good food at it's best...,Because of the passion put into his food I would recommend this book to anyone with that same passion...
1,Too many errors... but the second edition is great!,"Everyone can agree that the Teaching Music Through Performance series is one of the best books on Instrumental Music Education and Wind Band Literature out there. This book was a breakthrough book, but there are so many errors in this edition. I recommend get the second edition of the first volume, which revises all of this and adds more information.Again, I would not downplay this book, but the second edition is much more accurate than the first."
3,Feeling healthy,I ordered and used (as directed) one container of the product.. I was healthy when I started using it and remained so during and after using it. So I can't say there was any difference to my general health. I was hoping it would help my skin be healthier..which it did not. I noticed no change in my mild eczema during or after use. So I did not buy any more andwouldn't recommend it.
3,"okay, but not worth aggravation","if you really value your eyesight and cannot stand hassle while at the tanning salon, do not bother buying these. the ones i received are a pretty lavender color and the eyecups detach from the frames so you can wear them alone, but i wouldnt advise that. they come with an elastic string that you have to tie on yourself that holds them on to your face tightly while you tan. the problem is, the string keeps flying off and will not stay on! so i thought no big deal, i'll wear them without out it. but without the elastic band around your head to hold the goggles snugly in place (instead of just sitting on top of your eyes), UV light leaks in from the sides leading to overexposure. i had this happen and kept getting pink eye because of it according to my opthalmologist. gave them 3 stars because they do keep you from getting raccoon eyes and they are comfortable to wear."
3,"Perfect for the eye, but a need a modification..","This item is a perfect protection to the eyes. I've been doing stand-up tanning at the gym I'm working out. It seems pretty cool to use, but it has to adjust the edges of the goggles. The string included doesn't even fit the holes on both sides. Maybe if they can enlarge it a bit, it would be a perfect match. If you're patient enough to tie it over and over on the edges, then it's no big deal."
3,RICHARD REVISION,"Son buenos en cuanto al objetivo final del articulo, sin embargo son demasiado frágiles y se rompen fácilmente. El tiempo de entrega fue bueno."
4,Australian Gold Special-Eyez tanning goggles,"They worked alright for me in the tanning bed becuase I'm a really small person. The string stayed on the googles when I used the booth also. There was no leakage of UV light, but I don't think this product is for everyone. For instance, if you were larger than 110 pounds and over 5 feet tall, then I'm unsure that the detachable lenses would be usable for you. Although, when in the tanning booth, this product is usable for people of all sizes."
5,Caregiving made easy!,"I am a physician who took time off my career to take care of my 85 y/o mother who has dementia.We have a regular size wheelchair, 2 types of rollator walkers with transport capabilities but as my mother'shealth declined and needed to be wheeled everywhere ( including thro a smaller bathroom door), this wheelchairwas the answer to my prayers. It is very lightweight and portable ( collapses to fit even a partly filled car trunk) , very sturdyand well-made. It can carry a person up to 5'4 in height and up to 250 in weight and seat them comfortably for transport.Thank you so much for this product. Our family loves it.!"
3,SInger-songwriter nugget,"This is a good seventies album. I listened to the LP many, many times when it was first issued. ""If This Is Love"" was a Melissa Manchester single, but the Edelman version is very strong and a highlight of the disk. His voice is a bit nasal and can be an acquired taste, but the songs carry the album. Mr. Edelman wrote Barry Manilow's ""Weekend in New England"" and Manilow fans would be likely to find this worth a listen."
2,Not worth the price,The aroma and flavor seem fine but it's just too weak to be of any value. Used the entire bottle to flavor a quart of home made ice cream and people were guessing what it was. Not enough licorice flavor and I spent twice the price of the ice cream just for the flavor that was not really there. If it was concentrated enough to be of value that would be great but I would never waste money on this item again. Just not enough flavor for the money.
4,Not bad,"The book was good contained alot of info, however i prefer the book the resolution for men, very good book"
1,ugh. More of the same white boy frat funk baloney,"I picked this up on the recommendation of other reviewers here at amazon. What an incredible disappointment. They may have studied their record collections well enough but the end result is nothing more than a collection of really unoriginal, posturing ""groove rock"" that's no better than some ivy league Grand Cherokee ski bum act. Simply awful."
3,Thought it was a great idea,Was hoping this would get an old stain out of a quilt. Did not work on this stain..... But I do think it is worth trying again when needed.
3,Answer to your song question....,"Hey, Lita19...I know exactly which song you're talking about! I heard it for the first time during this movie and fell in love! I just had to track it down. It's called Morning Dew by Robert Plant. Unfortunately it's not on the soundtrack, but hopefully this info will help you find it elsewhere."
2,Lacking some songs,"Don't you just hate a movie soundtrack that doesn't include all of the songs? Invariably, it will be the one you're looking for! Regarding the hauntingly trippy ""Morning Dew,"" it was actually Robert Plant's beautiful version in the movie, not the Grateful Dead's. It was on his album ""Dreamland,"" but is available by the individual track, at least on iTunes, maybe on Amazon. Hope this is helpful to those searching for it. :-)People who like that song, might also enjoy 'Black Swan,' by Thom Yorke (of Radiohead), from his album, ""Eraser."" Similar vein."
5,Classic in One Compact,"If your a Baby Boomer this is a MUST have, Some Select Classics and a few Redone.Seller is Stellar A+++++great Movie to"
3,Does anyone know?,"Hey people's, At the end of the movie there is the song that repeats the words ""Show me the way"" Who could it be? I Need it. Thank You!"
4,explain thailand really well,"Well..frankly i didn't finish the book but after several pages reading i know it explain how thailand is, explain thai people really well. and i know just because well i'm one of them, i'm thai"
5,Capturing the Essence of Thailand,"This was my first experience with the Travelers' Tales books, but it certainly will not be my last. The stories vary from two to eight pages, and while they differ mightily from one another, each captures the essence of one part of the Thai culture. The stories are educational, entertaining, and some are really funny. A great book!"
5,a must have,"The book has become one of my favorites. Its full of short stories from an array of travelers from many different backgrounds. Some parts of it read very informational while after reading other parts of the book I could not stop laughing. There is so much information and experience from travelers over the years packed into this book...I would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to travel to Bkk, Chiang Mai or others planning to trek in the north. It also has some sections about Thai food."
5,"Interesting, Entertaining Personal Narrative Collection Set in Thailand","This collection of personal narrative of behind-the-scenes of Thailand's people and places make the ordinary seem extraordinary. A wonderful collection of excellent writing styles and interesting stories. You are sure to find a new favorite author within its pages. Thailand comes to life with this collection of poignant personal narrative set in the Land of Smiles.Diane Sontag, author ofTen Days in the Land of Smile: A Thailand Travelogue"
3,Pinocho's revenge -- OK,"My wife and kids saw this movie on cable and I missed it. They said it was great and funny so I thought I would get it. It was OK--the production was a bit 70's videotape look, special effects 5 out of 10, acting 6 out of 10, story predictable.There was a very nice nude sequence about 4 minutes long where Pinochio watches the maid (young and pretty) get out of the shower. That probably saved the movie for me.The one thing I did relate to was the sound of ""pitter-patter"" as Pinochio ran across the floor to get his next victim. Parents will recall the unmistakeable sound of small children when they hear this. It is somewhat disturbing to hear this sound that brings up happy and joyfull memories associated with a pending killing.It was worth $10 - $12 bucks for a laugh, good party movie."
1,"Bad, but campy enough to be fun to watch!","Basically, there is a puppet. Lo and behold, it comes to life. And, like the millions of horror films exactly like it that came before, he kills. Not very bloody movie, anyway. Pretty awful, but at times it's unintentionally hilarious."
2,Not enuff ROSALIND ALLEN ....NUDE!,"Seriously the only thing good about PR is the babe Rosalind Allen, the only reason to watch ( Altho the nanny is hot too ). Rosalind Allen is a major babe and should have showed more and a lot more. Without her, the movie gets 0 stars."
1,Worse than awful,"It's unbelievable that the director of ""Night of the Demons"" could give us such a lemon. Despite a few really original scenes this movie is non-redeemable. Tenny needs to get back with the man who wrote the script for his earlier film ... or something."
1,So Bad It should have never been made,Who ever made this just wasted time just to make a movie. I think this is one of worst movies ever o my god. Trust me if you want to check it out don't waste your time trust me. This movie is so bad if I had the power to destroy every copy i would. This movie deserves -20.
1,uh....what is this?,Gee.do I have anything to say about this movie?This stinks.I will tell you why its so bad.1:WHAT IS UP WITH THE LOW BODY COUNT?2:ACTING IS SHALLOW.AND 3: PINOCCHIO IS DEFEATED WHEN HE IS THROWN INTO A GLASS TABLE 1:HOW CAN GLASS KILL HIM? 2:ITS THE WORST PART OF THE MOVIE.IM THE NOSTALGIA KID.I REMEMBER IT SO YOU DONT HAVE TO.VISIT MY SITE AT CINEMASSACARE.COM TO SEE OTHER COOL REVEIWS!
3,"Oh, Thank you, Mommy. It's just what I've always wanted","Attourney/mother brings home evidence from a murder sight, a hideously ugly psyke-damaging wooden marionette, and her daughter wants to keep it. She then proceeds to commit grisly murders and blame them on the puppet. Better than the average never heard of low budgeter with some quality product but there aren't many scares. Just good enough to be worth watching."
2,Good movie. The nanny is attractive. Who knows about her?,"The nanny ""Sophia"" is really great looking. I was looking for more information on her. Her name is Candace McKenzie. Can anyone help me out. octoberbaby72@hotmail.com"
1,HA HA HA HA HA!,"Is this movie suppose to b a comedy? This movie is worthless the only parts worth watching in the film are a couple of nude scenes, one in the bedroom, and the other in the shower, besides that this movie is like a wanna be retarded copy cat of child's play the super gay version."
1,Don't even bother watching this movie.,This movie is not at all for a hard core horror movie fan.There was was way too much waiting around for something to happen butnothin ever did....
1,WOW,this movie was possibly the worst film ive ever seen. but that there was nudity so it earns 1 star.
3,not to bad but ....it sucked,this is a pretty cool movie but it suked NOT ENOUGH KILLS WE LUV ALOT OF KILLS LOTS OF BLOOD GORE!!!!!!1 HA HA HA HA HA HA !!!!!!!!
1,boring.......,"i only liked it when pinnochio talked. that was funny, but the rest of the movie was discusting. Some of the scens were very sick (not the blood, but other things). There was no blood hardly, and i could have made it alot better. I espected a good film but it was ... and i would never see it again."
3,silly but fun,The strangest thing about this film is the voice of Pinocchio. it sounds like that kid from the 70s who did those weird cartoon voice overs. overall a fun movie but very predictable. not much on effects.
5,I give this a TEN.,This product is awesome. Very vibrant colors. It brightens up the entire bathroom. Fit my standard tub perfectly. Love it.
2,An earnest muddle,"I really like Kelly's short stories, and I badly wanted to like this novel, but it just doesn't work. Two main problems: first, the protagonist is far too passive and mealy-mouthed, and an utterly unconvincing portrayal of a supposedly brilliant artist. And second, the alien civilization that he visits is very confusing, and facts about it are revelaed piecemeal and without enough context for the reader to be able to tell what really makes these creatures tick. Overall it reads like the first effort of a guy who might one day produce something really good - read Kelly's other stuff and ask for yourself if that promise has been fulfilled."
1,WASTE OF ALL MY QUALITY TIME WATCHING THIS BORNING VIDEO,"I HAVE BOUGHT A VIDEO CD FOR THIS TITLE, BUT THE STORYLINE IS BORING. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS A LOW BUDGET MOVIE AND YOU SHOULD MISS IT!"
2,Great if it worked,"This was the one thing my daughter wanted from Santa. She absolutely loves it which is the great thing. However, it broke within one day of opening it. We went for a Christmas walk and my daughter proudly held her new flashlight, and then with no warning (and new batteries) it completely died. If it worked I'd give it 5 stars, but something shouldn't fail that quickly on brand new batteries that were installed correctly."
5,...and going...and going...,"My daughter has REALLY put this light to the test. She can't sleep without it. In the morning and sometimes later the next night I see that it has been left on...about a year now and the battery life of this thing just keeps me amazed. Sure its dim, but it is very good at not wasting battery, unlike my kids. She drops it, the kids have ""battles""... she even dropped it in the potty once! Hubby opened it up and dried it out. It still woeks great! Couldn't be happier.The Toy Story one is equally great."
1,"cheap, cheap, cheap!!!",Very cheap right out of the package! The switch is difficult for my daughter to push up and got even worse over time. And the flashlight completely stopped working after only a couple months.
1,I Love Paris,"This was the most awful excuse for a travel video, which I thought I was purchasing. It was more like a very bad home video that my 16 year old daughter and her friends would have made. In fact I should not insult my daughter and her friends that way. They would have done a much better job. The commentary was horrific, she should definetly take some French lessons (the French people would be horrified) and throughout the whole video (only 22 minutes long)there was not ONE scene devoted to the eiffel tower, the most prominent landmark in the whole country!! This video certainly would not make me run to the nearest travel agent and purchase a ticket. The books that I took out from the library gave me a more vivid description of Paris. To say the least I was extremely disapponted."
3,It does what it says...except for the leveling,"The built in level is pointless...the tv hangs 3/4"" off. I'll have to make more holes in the wall to manually adjust it."
3,Not quite as described.,"This was very easy to install but it only really sits level when it's flush to the wall. When is pans out, it causes the tv to lean. I wish I had just bought the one that doesn't pan or tilt."
3,TV tilts if not perpendicular to the wall,"Recently purchased this mount and found that if the TV (23"") was not perpendicular to the wall, the TV would tilt to one side or the other. In other words, if I wanted to angle the TV towards my couch which is along another wall, the TV would tilt. I wound up taking the angling mechansim off and just using the actual wall mount and TV mount without the extension piece. This still allowed me to angle the TV both side to side and up and down, it just made the space behind the TV (for wires) less. I probably should have bought the cheaper model since it sounds like it does the same thing as my modification.Now that it is modified, the TV is level and the mount functions nicely. The mounting process couldn't have been easier. Overall, I am happy with this product."
3,Excellent Product,I have used this product on both my LDC TV in the bedroom and now have something like 10 at work for computer monitors. The home TV was tricky because of the weight causing a little give in the device causing the TV to be slighly angled. I got that work out after about 5 re-adjsutments. The mount was an earlier verion without the level. The ones at work work well. The one change I would like is the hole to be eliptical for adjustments without re-drilling the hole in the wall.
4,Complete and useful,"I have a 23"" lcd TV, and it looks really good on the wall. The product is what I've expected. Easy to install and looks good. Now I need to manage my cables, but very satisfied with the quality."
5,Comprehensive and useful,"Most people, when commenting about this book, tend to compare it to Lodish's Molecular Cell Biology. I own both, and I must say that they are quite similar in their content but different in the way of explaining concepts. Although Lodish's book is a little more up-to-date, it's just a matter of time until a new edition of MBoC is published. In fact, a great number of concepts are clearer in Molecular Biology of the Cell... and vice-versa. About the book, it is the authoritative text of molecular biology for beginners and a reference guide to all fields of cell biology. The chapters concerning the structure of the cell and of the organelles are amazing and include in-depth explanations. It also comprehends the best revision chapters on macromolecules compared to Lodish's. The team of authors was accurate to compose one of the best books in molecular biology for students of all biological and biomedical sciences."
3,4ed of molecular biology of the cell,"A new fourth edition of B. Alberts, et al. book Molecular Biology of the Cell, ISBN 0815332181, Garland Publishers is listed in the medscape bookstore for future publication. I don't know what price Amazon will list it at when it comes out."
1,"May be catagorised: ""Antique""","Ounce apon a time in the beginning of the 90's there was a great book: ""Molecular Biology of the Cell"". However, this very book missed the oppportunity to keep up with exponentiall growth of knowledge accumulated in this field. Indeed it lacks the fundamental information needed by every cell biology student and may only satisfy the needs of a AP biology class at High School."
5,The best of el Hachemi,"I have enjoyed very much the music of el Hachemi, and I really appreciate the excelent quality of this CD. I've heard this CD many times since I bought it from Paris and I still hear it every day. If you like the Chaabi music, this is a must!"
4,Looks good,I have used Accel products in the past and they are pretty good.As long as the price is right then I'll purchase their stuff.This item is made in the USA which is another plus for me.
3,"Stop all the yelling ""Father Water Logger""","First of all why did they change the opening theme song? The new one is lame! Then they pretty much ruined the whole show by adding the father-son scream team of water loggers, with big pappa doing nothing but flip out and yell at everyone all the time! By the way if he would have done that to my launch pad and just drove off without any regard for his actions, I think I would be taking him to court, or recommend they send him to anger management. Little Browning Jr. wants to take over daddy's company, however, he can't handle stress, or the cameras (hey junior, you agreed to do the show, and I bet you are being compensated quite well for it). So man up! Basically I agree with one of the comments from season one's review....... Get into these guys' personal lives a bit and make it more personal. You can only watch trees falling and guys arguing and complaining about the same thing for only so long. And Iike the show, and I'm a chick! ;)"
4,Good album,A light but well produced album from 2nd Chapter of Acts. It was very enjoyable to rehear the songs from a few years back when the group was still together.
5,A wonderful guide to today's medical coding needs!,"I have had the good fortune to be a student of Ms. Dodson. Her teaching is clear, concise and easy to understand. I know other students, nurses and others interested in the health technology field will learn from this book and enjoy it very much."
1,Expired product,"I always loved this perfume and have been looking for it for ages but its out of production so when i found it on Amazon i couldn't believe my luck! I bought 2 bottles and could not wait for them to reach me. unfortunately the perfume smelt terrible! I thought maybe it was a case of expectations and memory being sweeter than it was in actuality but when i had my sister smell it too, she also agreed it was terrible. The perfume has expired!!! Its terrible and now i have 2 bottles of old, unusable perfume. Amazon should not be selling junk like this..."
1,A good burning book.,"This book will come in handy when winter comes and I need to start a fire. The last time I heard such dribble about the Corps, I was in a bar full of drunk Sailors. At least they still respect our fighting abilities and thank God we fight on their side. To the author, your attemt at revisionist history will fall flat."
1,Missed Calling,"Revisionist history notwithstanding, Cameron has, from the safety and comfort of high office, done a predictable and credible job of coloring himself the same shade of yellow as his contemporaries, most routinely referred to these days as ""Journalists."" To quote a better man, Cameron has shown himself to be, ""One of the great fiction writers of our time."""
1,Horrible Book... Burn Baby Burn!!!,"GOD made the earth, GOD made the sky, GOD made this ignornat fool... only GOD knows why!"
4,Good Book,"I was disappointed with this book as I have ""How to Sail Around The World"" by the same Author. Which is a reprint of the same book. I thought I was going to get a more in depth informative book"
5,MasterChef Season 3,"This is my 3rd Season of MasterChef purchased through Amazon, and it was again a quality video experience. I will be buying Season 4 when available."
5,Love this show!,All Foodies will love this show. When will Season 1 and 2 be available? Looking forward to seeing them too.
3,Passed the test using this as a secondary text,"I passed the test with a 836. This is midway between the passing cutoff (764) and the maximum score (900).I used FastPass as a quick review before taking the test. If you are new to InfoSec, as I was, read a full study guide first.The one I used was ""Security+ Study Guide, 2nd Edition"" published by Sybex 2004, ISBN 0-7821-4350-4. This book is on CompTIA's Authorized Quality Curriculum list for this test and it deserves to be.If you are a seasoned InfoSec pro FastPass may be all you need to pass the test. One caution: FastPass gets asymmetric cryptology and public/private keys wrong (the Study Guide gets it right; also goto rsalabs.com and click Crypto FAQ).Read my Amazon review on the ""Security+ Study Guide, 2nd Edition"" mentioned above.D. Duffy, MBA, CNE, MCSE, ASE, CCNA, CCDA, A+"
1,This thing cannot work ever.,"The unit does not have a powerful enough solar panel to run any fan powerful enough to more any more than 10 cubic feet/minute (CFM)With the average car sporting 150 CF then it would that this unit a minimum of 15 minutes to change the air in the cabin.In that 15 minutes the air that is replacing the air being moved out is already hotter than the original air than was removed 15 minutes ago.It cannot work, it will not work so everyone that purchased one should complain to the AG of Washington State that Amazon is selling an item that has been proved not to work, and could not do what is being claimed and are therefore committing fraud.To keep a car cabin at ambient temperature you need to exchange the air in 30 seconds or less. Or the system needs to remove 300 CFM."
1,Bad purchase,We couldn't get the product to work like it was suggested. It was a pain getting it to stay in the window. Wouldn't recommend this product.
2,Trillium Worldwide TWI-7001 AutoVent Solar-Powered Ventilator,This item does not work with even light tint on the window. Must have direct sunlight or fan will not operate.
1,Bad customer service!!,"I cannot give a complete review of this product because I never received it, however I was charged for it. I tried to contact the seller with no success!"
1,Not a Good Product.,"The problems of ths product are:1) It doesn't fit in my windows. I'ved tried it in my 2 cars but still it doesn't fit in it.2) The weather strips are too short. I searched it on the internet for additional weather strips but it was not available. And for all I know is it is really not available in market/stores.3) The solar plates must be facing directly to sunlight. There are some instances that the AutoVent is not working because of the angle of sun rays.4) The strips are hardly to remove. If you set it up for the leftside of your car window, it should always be at the left side. if you choose to change the position to the right window, it is hard to remove the strips from the AutoVent to set it up for the right window.5) the AutoVent is not practical if you are installing it up if you are in a hurry."
1,just more junk,"did nothing for my car. i bought a sun reflector for the windshield and this lowered the temperature far more than this item. junk, just not worth the shipping and handling charge it has to be installed everytime you wish to use it. needed a cover over the outlet so that when you are driving and want to use the AC you don't lose AC out the vent of the device."
1,TWI-7001 AutoVent Solar-Powered Ventilator,"I bought two of these items, one for each back window of my sedan. They made absolutely NO difference in the heat in car. The Florida panhandle was too much for them. Perhaps in Vermont or Maine they might be able to keep up. For me, though, they are a waste of my money. One star because the fans twirled under solar power. That's all."
1,"Great, but ...","The device is well built and really protects the rest of the cracked window and it does not creat any noise, and it worked perfictly for 24 hours before dying and refusing to work,"
4,AutoVent Solar-Powered Ventilator,"A great product at a great price. Unlike other imitations, the TWI-7001 has a built in moisture seal at the top. Rain does not get in; dust does not get in. The hot air goes out and the temperatures are markedly lower that before.The only draw-back is that you have to teach your wife to take it out of the window before going through the automatic car wash. Water (and soap) can and does come in at the angle sprayed. Yet despite being totally soaked, the TWI-7001 AutoVent Solar-Powered Ventilator still works like new."
4,Rewired,I rewired 2 of them to a solar panel that sits on my truck box. I installed the fans in my rear door windows on a 2007 frontier and the wires are hidden by the interior trim. This allows me to keep them installed all the time (it helps to have vent shades on the windows. The voltage output from the solar panel is more than enough and works on cloudy days. Spent overall 70 bucks for 2 fans and the panel. This would be a great product if the panel was seperate from the fan and could be mounted on the roof.
4,WORKS FINE!!!,"I had this fan in the 90's, in a Toyota Corolla in Oregon. It worked fine, the car was a lot cooler in the summer and I am looking for another to buy. I think Target sells it now.First you clean your side back window, insert the pieces to make it fit, then close up the window snugly, it should be on the door that is RARELY opened. Make sure that the red solar glass is inside the window facing out...I saw some idiot driving around with a the fan facing out one day! The unit stays in the window, it only comes out if you are going through the car wash. In the southwest I would recommend getting one for each side, but if you have only one you just park the car so the sun is on it, it's no different than pulling in and pumping your gas on the correct side. It works well about 10-15 degrees cooler, I'd say..."
1,Auto vent total junk,The solar powerd auto vent does not move enough air to make any diferance in temperatur at all. I feel it was a total waste of time and money. It might make a cute science project in grade school but for its intended purpose it is useless.
1,NO fan of the fan!,"this is not a fan, its a plastic wheel that moves one cubic inch of air per minute. In other words it sucks! And I don't mean air, needless to say I'm not happy with the product and I am returning the two that I bought."
2,"Well, It Does Work",I installed the device in a 1993 Buick Roadmaster and found that the fan did run in direct sunlight. It did not reduce the temperature inside the car very much if at all. The item was shipped promptly and arrived in good condition.
5,More air freshener than cooling fan,"I've had one of these for more than 15 years (egad, I'm old!), from when it was called the AutoVent Turbo. It is just now starting to make a rattling noise, which shocks me, considering it's outlasted two of my cars. Weird.I'm glad they're marketing this as a 'ventilator' rather than something that cools the car. On sunny summer days, this is the best thing for airing out my car's interior. I never fuss with the window plastic; I just check the forecast for rain and plop only the fan part in the window. When I come back to my car, it smells like fresh air instead of a 6-year-old Mazda decorated in Taco Bell wrappers.How much of the freshness is based on the fact that my window is cracked open for the fan, I can't tell. But I am ordering a replacement for my broken one now."
1,Didn't Work AT ALL,"This device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT SAYS IT DOES. The unit is hard to install, for beginners. It is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather. If there is low sunlight, or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows, even factory shading, IT DOES NOT WORK. You must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it, and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun???"
1,waste of time and money,"it does not work and when it arrive i found it broken !! made from cheap materials ,and i can rate it with a half star"
1,Television ads overstate effectiveness.,"This product does not cool down the car. It is too small. I would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks. If you buy this, PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PETS OR KIDS IN THE CAR and think that it is safe."
1,solar rip off,"this product does work, BUT it has to face the sun, so if you put it in the window that faces east it will work in the morning, not in the afternoon, it needs to be put in a window that faces southwest to work the way they claim in the TV ad.Also they are hard to place with powered windows."
1,"Unforuntately, these devices do not work","Unforuntately, these devices do not work. The unit did nothing to reduce the temperatures in my car. There was also a TV channel that did a test of these type of units and they found similar results, that it does nothing."
2,"Good idea, but...","It's a good fan which could probably move a lot of air out of your car, but when i installed it i realized that the space it creates between the top of the window and the door frame was unacceptably large (about 1"" on my vehicle) which means anyone can easily insert their fingers in to the space it creates. The plastic guards that are provided with the fan are meant to fill the ""gap"", but this renders the window unusable as the guards will fall out when you open it.PS - if you have a car with ""auto close"" power windows, this device will likely not work as the window has a pressure sensor to avoid trapping fingers and is triggered by the fan when trying to close the window."
1,ineffective design,"The shipper and handling of the product was excellent, however, the product itself is not design to be effective. The solar panel should be at more of an angle to catch the sun's rays in order to cause it to operate. If window have any tint, it will not work. The design should allow the solar panel to be attached on the roof of the car to operate effectively."
1,a cheap sunshield is good enough,"Unless solar panel technology improves greatly AND the solar panel size is increased by 10 fold, I don't see how this fan can be effective."
3,Solar Powered Car window fan,"We have only had this operating for a few days in the driver's side window of our small van camper. Very easy to install. It certainly does work, as long as we park in full sun - which is often unavoidable as we travel! It is not a strong fan, and since it is silent (no motor!) we have to check to make sure it is operating. But it is certainly a lot better than no fan/no ventilation while we are parked. I would not want to leave a dog in a parked car and rely on this to keep the dog cool. But it does help keep the inside temperature down somewhat. Well worth a try, and I am a fan of solar powered anything."
1,The worst!!!!,Right out of the box it was a piece of garbage. The sun isn't strong enough for this thing.
4,Old Somerset on the Eastern Shore of Maryland,The book provided the information that I needed to track some of my ancestors. It is a very interesting book.
3,Review of Microclean 304 Internal Filter,"It does a very good job of filtering my tank. I have a frog with a half and half tank setup. The suction is fine for the frog, but when I put a fish in there, it was over taken by the strength of the suction and the power of the water being filtered out. Not too bad overall."
2,TMI (Too much information),"When I was learning to ski I found a book describing the mechanics of the ski and its interaction with the snow surface (best point - keep those knees bent)which helped me to become a very good skier. I was hoping to duplicate that for golf (with professional instruction in addition, of course). But, while the book is a very excellent engineering study, it is unreadable and not conducive to being finished (I did not). The information I needed may be in there but it is not easily found or explained. It is more like a grad student's doctoral thesis that was then greatly expanded by the entire engineering department."
5,Understanding Golf,"While this book has been in print since about 1968, there has never been a better one for understanding golf....in my opinion.Modern test equipment and modern golf equipment have served to verify what these men found about hitting the ball.They produce detailed analysis of set-up, swing and equipment and yet they always yield to what works.For example, in their section on putting they state ""Once a player has adopted any of the many possible simple methods, putting is largely a matter of confidences.""If you really want to improve your swing and your shots, then read and practice this book above all others.BIll Fontaine"
2,Soundtrack,"I too agree with the person from Canada. I have been searching for the original soundtrack to ""The Eddie Duchin Story"", as I am getting married and wish to play some of the songs from this most enjoyable movie. I have it on an album, but I feel that CD would do it more justice. Can anyone please help me as to where it can be located?"
3,Recomentation on where ti find the cd,"To those of you who are looking for the cd version, I found it in the FNAC in Paris, maybe you can get it via email. It is the exact movie version played by Carmen Cavallaro."
2,Misleading Title,"Perhaps a better title for this book would have been ""Poor Choices"". I found this book to be about someone who was quite depressed about life and went from one bad choice to another. There was very little about cycling in the book and the little that was led me to believe that the author doesn't know very much about cycling. I kept hoping that the character in the book was going to run into a true cyclist who was going to teach him about the sport(how to ride, how to dress, etc.) This however was not the case. Based purely on this book, I will not read another Greg Garrett novel."
2,Schiek sleeves,"They fit weird, the design doesn't flex enough, it goes from too loose to too tight and does not provide continual support on the arm."
5,Amazing,These speakers are amazing. The bass is great and on full volume you can feel the sound in the floor. Great for parties and a must for enhancing laptop sound. Only one word of advice...the speakers tend to get pulled off of the desk easily so be careful because after a few good smacks with the floor my right one isn't working anymore. They cost too much to buy twice so be nice to them. And the cord at its connection point. I bent it one too many times by accident so now its acting a bit goofy. All in all these were my fault...the speakers are fabulous. I love them. Way better than normal speakers for movies and music. Brings out a lot of sounds you may miss...even mimics surround sound when you put them kind of distanced from each other...which is quite easy since the cords are fairly long.
3,"Great sound, stubborn on/off button","I have owned this set of speakers for less than a year. The power button is starting to not respond when I touch it to turn the speakers on or off. Other than that, excellent sound and bass. I guess they are fine if you are looking for a ""disposable"" set of speakers and subwoofer. I will probably upgrade next time to a set that has a few more good reviews."
5,I love this book,I have several classical guitar books and this one is my favorite. The exercises actually sound like songs. You get to jump into some beautiful music very quickly. It doesn't feel like practice when I use this book.
4,Excellent introduction to the guitar,"My teacher suggested this book and it is terrific, though I do agree with another reviewer that placing fingering suggestions next to the notes can get in the way of learning to read the music. It took me almost ten months to work through the entire book. In the beginning, I could not read guitar music and had no idea what I was doing. I can now play a good little repertoire or songs without sending my wife running to get the ear plugs! The layout of the book is very logical, continually building on the skills you have already learned. It also includes a good mix of exercises as well as popular classical pieces to learn. I look forward to continuing my studies in Volume 2."
4,Arthur Ransome,"Many American children are tremendous readers. As a grandmother I find it difficult to give my grandchildren books that they haven't read. The Arthur Ransome books are a good solution. The books are nearly all about Messing About in Boats, and they are set in Britain. Get used to a girl named Titty and the books are not too dated. The kids all specialize in self reliance which I consider a vital characteristic in the young!"
5,Spellbound by Puppet Child,"I too am spellbound by Puppet Child. I kid you not -- this book should be must reading for every person (including the judges in our courts) who demand to look behind the closed doors of a justice system -- where the ""blind"" option indeed disfigures so many lives. And the victims -- so much needless anger, despair and pain. What a pity. Puppet Child's suspenseful storyline flows so easily -- I was into this book immediately. Carner really did her homework. When's the movie?"
5,The blind ineptitude of the American family court system,"The debut novel of Talia Carner, Puppet Child is a social issues narrative revealing the weaknesses and blind ineptitude of the American family court system. Rachel Belmore is a 34-year-old advertising executive and mother who must struggle to defend her young daughter against the sexual depredations of her husband, and subsequently finds herself losing a legal battle in this emotionally compelling drama that could be found in any contemporary family court, anywhere in this country."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Don't buy this chamois. The quality is very poor. It is made in China. Something that Amazon does not indicate in product details. After rinsing the chamois as instructions state, there were holes in the chamois. Not worth the $16.28. This is an overpriced poor quality disposable Chinese chamois. I have owned many chamois which have lasted years. This one will be good for one wash."
1,Poor QUALITY,"I have been buying Chamoies for the past few years on Amazon with no problems. But the last couple I have received started to shed all over my car, these are new not old ones. On a dark car it showes up like little lint spots not so bad on the lighter color cars. Very disappointed in these.... I have been using Chamoies for over 40 years and have never had this problem before..."
5,Works Great!,You have to wash the leather chamois before using or there will be residue left on your car. After it is broke in it worked great for drying with a microfiber cloth.
1,Detailer's Choice Chamois,This chamois is very thin and will not last long. I purchased same item two months ago and is falling apart. After purchasing again realized this chamois is too thin and will not hold up with repeated usage.
3,Quality should be better,"This is a good sized chamois. However, there was a 1 1/2 inch tear at one end of the chamois, and it had been sewn up. That is unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. The company should ship only first-class products. They should note in the product description if the chamois has been repaired. Another problem is the idiotic packaging. The chamois is stapled to the cardboard instructions with huge staples that leave holes in the chamois. It's a classic case of not thinking on the part of the manufacturer. This could be a good product, but you are taking a chance when you order. I would send it back but it's not worth my trouble at this point. I'd advise buying one you can check before you buy e.g. at Wal-Mart or another discount store. I'm not blaming Amazon but the supplier of the chamois."
2,Is this real leather?,"I had a nice leather chamois before, but I'm not sure if this is real leather. It smells like it, but it's really thin compared to the one I had in the past. Also with my old leather, it was like a leather jacket in that one side felt like the outside leather, and the other suede. This one is really thin, and both sides look like the suede part. I think the price is high for what it is."
3,Non Fiction,"Sagan, along with co-writer Ann Druyan takes a look at what comets are, where they come from, and how they affect things around them.They also speculate on the possible and actual effects that comets have had throughout history physically, as well as culturally."
5,"Hilarious, sick, wonderful!","My wife surprised me with this book for Christmas. As soon as I started reading, I remembered why I married her. In Me Own Words had me laughing out loud immediately and the laughs didn't let up until I finished the last page. A work of pure genius!"
5,Indubitably rad,"incredible.breathtaking.hilarious.even though it's a bit too short, i'm glad that it left me wanting more and also that roumeiu has written sequels to this deeply fascinating book about the real life of the world's evader. blessings upon you for purchasing this book."
2,Oooooooookay,"Ummm, yeah, sure it was amusing in that sophomoric kinda way but you're not gonna die laughing or pee your pants. While it is worth going through once or twice, unfortunately you will forget all about this book within a week. The drawings are simplistic but fit perfectly into the style the author was going for. It is humorous but not over the top hilarious as some claim."
1,Bigfoot - Autobiography,Sad very sad. The first page was funny but the rest of the book was just plain stupid. I find it difficult to believe any publisher would waste good paper on this.
1,Pass this one up,"What a waste of time and money. As a dedicated sasquatch researcher, I learned absolutely nothing from this book. The illustrations were clever and amusing but the text wanting. My advice is to pass this one up completely."
1,Sorry I wasted my money,"I was so disappointed by this book, maybe I'm a prude but it's not necessary for their to be profanity in a book for it to be funny or entertaining. I bought this book for my 14 year old son for Christmas but after reading the book when it came in a decided not to give it to anyone. I don't even want people to know I have this trash in my house. I gave it one star because you have to give it something."
2,Not as funny as I NOT DEAD,I read Bigfoot I Not Dead before I read this one.This one is not as funny. The other had me laughing out loud.I noticed that I did not crack even a smile on this one.
5,Killer end to a great career!,"Right off the bat, the 3 new tracks will blow you away. They have more of a death feel which is great. There's so much creative potential left in these guys its a shame they called it quits. But at least they went out on fire. I hadn't heard any of the material before Reborn, so this collection was a real treat for me. I found that as much as I love Fitzhugh's voice, DJ could definitely deliver. So now I'm gonna purchase the rest of LS' catalogue. Definite classics."
5,ALL THE HITS ROCK!!!!!,"Ah, Living Sacrifice has finally come out w/a greatest hits album and its amazing! I love all there songs they selected for the cd and I think the 3 new tracks just add to the metalness of the whole cd. Like the bands slogan says Let The Metal Onslought Begin! It brings back good'ol memories when Bruce would scream away and Lance would pound away and the thunderus sounds of Rocky on his guitar and the bass of Arthur and the percussion of Matt makes me really miss this band a lot! Well I will really miss the band and they left a great legacy for the christian metal scene to step up to! If it wasn't for this band I honestly think Christian Metal wouldn't be were it is today and you know the best thing is that they choose to do it all for God. So go and get this cd b/c its so awesome!"
4,"The First 10 Tracks Are Priceless... The Last 6 Are ""Whatever""","As a newcomer to the band... I'm absolutely in love with Bruce Fitzhugh's vocals and grit. The first 10 tracks on this album feature Bruce, and are AMAZING. Grit, dynamic, power, passion... it's all there! Unfortunately (after song 10) the compilation crashes and burns on top of a couple of really weak screamers. This album gets 4 stars, but just for the first 10 tracks."
2,WHY?,"Why can't they just f'ing sing?!?!?! The music sounds awesome but I just can't get past the vocals...the LACK of vocals - it just kills it! I've heard so many cool riffs and bands, but once the vocalist opens his mouth - GARBAGE! Growling is NOT singing. UGH!"
5,Songs I loved then are still great,It's wonderful to revisit the music I enjoyed as a teen and young adult in CD format. Priced well too.
3,Please come to Boston,"I purchased this album based on the hit song, ""Please Come to Boston"" The song holds up rather well, but the production is dated and a little heavy handed. The rest of the CD is a mixed bag."
3,Still waiting for the best...,"Personally, I am still holding out hope that the album that (I believe) ""Please Come to Boston"" origianlly came from will be released on CD soon. The album's title was ""Apprentice in a Musical Workshop."" I still have the vinyl copy. Better choice of tunes than anything here (IMO), and includes the haunting ""My Father's Fiddle."" I have heard that Wounded Bird Records may be releasing it sometime this summer."
5,Wonderfully Insightful!!,"Bill Gothard is nothing less than a modern day apostle, laying again the foundations of truth from God's Word to a selfless generation. ""The Pineapple Story"" gnaws at your conscience, (as does anything else Bill Gothard teaches) and provokes introspection leading to deep resounding change within the reader. This book is a treasure--HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who is caught in the throes of fighting for their ""rights"" in life!"
2,"Content good, writing quality poor","I saw a UTube video with this missionary telling the story of his experiences. It was entertaining and delightful - in part due to his facial expressions and his particular brand of English. (He is Dutch) However, the book in an attempt to present the exact words of the missionary, fell far short of presenting the story in an engaging literary manner. It fell flat. The message is still there, but the grammar is poor and someone who did not understand the reason for this poor writing style might well wonder why they had paid any money at all for this book. Get the DVDs."
2,Does not last long,"These are plastic. If you so much as sit on your bed too quickly you may find that you will end up breaking the risers over time. When I used risers, I found that I had to buy several replacements. I recommend you get solid risers rather than hollow ones like this. Just make sure the height is what you want."
1,Morning Surprise,Worked for a few months then woke to a crash as one leg of the bed passed clean through the one it was on....
2,Cracked,"Well, they look like they would have been sturdy, but one of them arrived cracked, which is discouraging given how much weight they claim to hold/ how durable they are supposed to be!"
1,don't waste your money,I've tried to set my bed up on these three times now and it keeps tipping over. They don't work.
1,Woke up to a big noise when the bed leg/wheel broke right through!,"We bought a set of these about 7 months ago and all was well until we woke up one morning to a very loud noise. My husband thought we were having an earthquake and the dog was barking from alarm! It turned out that the leg/wheel of our bed had broken clean through one of the risers. Suddenly our bed was on a big tilt. Just to note, we are of average weight so it wasn't a factor in the break. Well, I can tell you that we won't buy another set of these! Obviously, these are not strong enough unless you have a twin size bed with only one person sleeping on it. Take note to the company that made them: you need to improve your product because people are wasting their money on your product!"
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I went through two sets of these and both sets failed. The problem with this product is no structural support in the construction of the risers. After a few weeks, the riser cracks and the frame legs go right through the riser. Its just a sheet of plastic that keeps the bed up; the body of the riser is totally hollow.If these risers were made of solid wood they'd work fine. But don't even both with this product."
5,"A ""MUST"" read for Sci-Fi die hards","As fellow reader Craig Chilton mentioned, ""it doesn't get any better"". I first read this book back around 1982. It was the FIRST Sci-fi book I could not put down. As I read it, I saw it. I never read anything like it. Alot of the story is still vivid in my mind ( ya so I've read it more than a few times ). As a matter of fact I've purchased this book 3 times after lending it out and not getting it back ( those lucky souls). As of 2-4-98 my search is on again to find another copy, out there waiting for my fourth purchase. So please leave one for me on the self, I have to have it ! As for turning this story into a movie, guess I'm not the only one who agrees it'd be KILLER !!!"
3,Get the job sorta done,"I think I should have purchased goggles with the band across. When I went tanning they were constantly falling off and I felt like the light was getting in. The price was right, and it was shipped well too. the product itself was not my favorite."
4,No tan lines!,I worked at a tanning salon years ago that sold these and I ended up losing them. I have yet to find another salon that sells them so I took to Amazon and there they were! I love these because you never have to worry about tan lines across the bridge of your nose or on the side of your face if using straps. Obviously the only downside is having to have another pair with a strap if you want to tan in a stand up.
5,Eyewear,The packing was great and the item was as expected. they worked great and protected my eyes. I could not complain
1,fall off of my eyes during use,"I don't like this style to use in a tannning bed, you have to balance them so they don't fall off! I threw them out and bought the kind that are molded together with a band around the back of your head."
1,Crapoola,"In 10 years I have only hated a handful of books. This is one of them. Half way into the story I was praying there would be a note from the editor that it was all a joke and if you read this far you would receive a $1,ooo,ooo a year for the rest of your life.WOW I hated this book.I cant express how bad this is...I can, but AMAZON WOULD NEVER PRINT THE REVIEW."
4,Wonderfully scary!,"This book might not be everyone's cup of tea but I was enthralled with the world that Connolly presents. I couldn't put it down. It is definitely not for the faint of heart. But the characters were vivid and original. Charlie Parker is a kind of angel whose karma, it seems, is to root out the most evil who dwell in our world, out of sight to most of us...Frankly I like his premise... I want Charlie to find peace... eventually, but not yet!"
4,A little convoluted,"It referred back to characters in earlier books that I haven't had a chance to read yet. The writing style was very good, though. It made me want to seek out more of his work."
3,"Ultimately it was good, but...","I liked this book in the end, but felt it really got bogged down with all the historical detail. It was a little slow going for a while but everything came out OK in the end. There were a couple of times that I wasn't sure I could get through it. Glad I did, though."
2,In Need of an Editor,"I have read everything Connolly has writen and on the whole it has been very good, particularly the early stuff. This one, however, is sadly in need of a good editor who could have cut it down from around 600 pages to three.Everything is described in great detail, over two pages devoted to telling us how a minor character became a pimp, (as if we cared), pages of historical data printed in italics, and endless psychobabble of Parker's emotional problems with himself, his family and the world at large.The writing is good when it sticks to the action, but one part hard boiled detective (where it should have stayed),one part supernatural hokum, one part history and one part romance, equals a total mess."
5,Good Stuff!,"The stories keep getting a little more supernatural as the series continues, and for those who have read his previous books, you won't be disappointed! One of the most entertaining authors I've read."
5,5 stars for strangeness,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the Charlie Parker series but i found this one alittle offputting. The premise that oldcharlie is a fallen angel is abit much. As usual the book still held my interest. I hope, though, that the angel business is history."
4,Very busy plot(s).,"If you like Charlie Parker books, you will like this book. In each of John Connolly's Parker books, there seem to be several situations feeding into the main plot. I think this books surpasses the others in the number of stories being told simultaneously."
5,Connolly has done it again,"The Parker series is unlike any I have ever read. Connolly mixes fantasy, horror, and detective procedurals into a fascinating mix. This book reveals the backstory of the Parker character and pushes the envelope. A book that combines serial killers, religious fanatics, the fight between good and evil, the nature of friendship and love, and man's quest for redemption all in a page-turning read. No author even attempts what Connolly does and certainly no one does it better."
4,Wonderful Novel,"This is the first lead character Charlie Parker novel by Mr. Connolly that I have read. It won't be the last. This story works on several levels from the murder mystery plot to a more metaphysical tale. There are sections of this book as well written as anything I have ever read. The book is a page turner which also combines reflective content. I enjoyed both levels and expect to read more from Mr. Connolly. He combines writing talent with interesting research and thoughtful challenges to the conventional read. Well done, sir!"
5,A great buy,"My wife is a huge Clarks fan, as she says their shoes are very comfortable to wear. These shoes are no exception--she wears them all the time! The colors are great too."
4,A Moving Memoir,"In this moving memoir and carefully researched historical study, an insider tears apart the popular image of the postwar American-run ""war crimes"" trials of Germans. As a young court reporter at the U.S. war crimes trials held at Dachau, the author returned to the transcripts -- and his memories of those proceedings -- after more than 40 years for a fresh look at how injustice was done to the defendants, and to historical truth. Incorporates the personal experience of a sensitive American observer and original archival digging to make a major contribution to the study of the postwar trials. Banned in Germany!"
3,Some obviouse scraches everywhere,"I haven't used it, but the scraches make me uncomfortable. I don't know if it's normal, but I hope I could find it useful later on."
3,"Not the GREATEST guide to get, but helpful....","With an emphasis on the 'NOT greatest' part. Technically, it DOES deliver what it said it would, which is sample questions and answers of previous tests. However, no EXPLAINATIONS to the answers. But this one does have a brief physical geology overview in the back.It is certainly NOT a self-contained study guide, like <http://www.120collegecredits.com>. 120collegecredits.com is your most economical, comprehensive deal to passing many of the various clep/dsst/Excelsior exams. I only bought this guide because instantcert did not yet develop a content guide for this particular test (DSST Physical Geology). Bottom line: DO NOT use this guide by itself...get another study guide or an appropriate textbook on physical geology.So buy a used copy if you can find one, which I happen to have! But also check out <http://www.120collegecredits.com>. Good luck on the test :)"
3,Great bed for only TWO days,"I got this Pooh honey pot inflatable bed for my 4.5 year old boy. The bed is very colorful and my son liked it a lot. However, he enjoys playing and jumping on the bed. The bed holds up for only two days. Then there was a significant leak at the side, which is beyoond repair. I do not recommend this to those who have active kids. This bed is small. The length is good for up to average height 5 to 6 year old kids. The pump is not very efficient. It took a while to blow up the bed."
1,Trash re-hash,"Imagine the horror of receiving this book as a gift, not once, not twice, but thrice. Well that happened to me. This book portrays Judy as a horrible person who only lives to cause havoc in the lives of those she loves. Anyone who really knew Judy will tell you that nothing could be further from the truth.And what's with the story of Judy and Liza at the London Palladium? Judy did not try to sabotage or ridicule her daughter's efforts on stage. This is the problem with society, we take everything too literally. Liza merely said (with great humor and respect) that working with her mother was competition with enormous love and respect. Everyone present that night denied any friction between the two, and recall Judy's advice to pay their respects to Liza as well.Avoid this like the plague and make sure you don;t get it three times."
1,Old myths die hard.,"James Spada took an old myth and turned it into this shoddy book. It's bascially a trash, rehash of stories of the relationship between Judy and Liza that were not true to begin with.Save your money and buy ""Judy"" by Gerold Frank, amongst a few others on Judy Garland. 1 star maybe for the pictures, but the good pictures do not compensate for a lying text."
4,Arthur Shawcross book,"If you like True Crime books, this one will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up!"
4,GREAT ideas for a different kind of quilt,"This book is full of ideas for quilts that are a bit out of the ordinary and far from the traditional. The full color photos show the finished quilts which are a great inspiration. The varied projects included inside the pages give insight to many other crafting avenues as well as quilting. I own many quilt and craft books, but epspecially like the personal touch that these projects afford the quilter/crafter."
3,So so,"The shirt was funny but is an strange size. I ordered an extra Large and the shirt had like a 15 inch neck. That is too small for a large, maybe medium."
3,Function good--fabric cheezy,"The function and protection of the bag was nice. It is a ""sleeve"" meaning that you won't have space to put much more in than a few files and your laptop/cords/accessories. It is very comfortable to wear and the weight distributes nicely on the padded strap. I ended up returning the item however due to the fabric. I purchased the white one, and the fabric had this strange space-age sheen to it that made the bag look cheap. The quality of the bag and material is good, I just couldn't get past the way it looked. I don't want to look like I'm on the star ship enterprise when lugging my macbook pro."
1,"Nice case for my MBP, but won't last long...","I liked the case, it was stylish, light and safe with the two straps, I used to commute by bike and it was very convenient.My 15"" Macbook Pro fits nicely inside and there is enough space for the accessories and daily small things. I have the white/silver version that is also highly visible at night.Unfortunately the side net is weak and could tear easily.But my biggest concern is that after one year of moderate use (actually, it was in use only for several months) the main strap started to tear off where it attached to the bottom of the side, so practically there is no way to carry it safely anymore, it can fall any time.I expected better durability, it's not so cheap product to became useless after a year.I can't recommend it."
5,Toughtful and well-made - beware of Amazon distributor...,"This is a nicely designed backpack for bike commuters like me. The cross-strap design is very secure and stops the backpack from moving while riding. The interior is well padded and protective. I have dropped the pack with my macbook pro 15"" with no damage (my laptop travels inside a Tuscano neoprene sleeve inside the backpack). I had one of the sliders in the front zipper break (it has two) and the manufacturer (Mac-Case) nicely replaced the bag with a brand new. Excellent people! I do not have much to say for ANTOnline.com, the Amazon distributor that refused to take care of the problem and referred me to the manufacturer because I had purchased the item over 30 days before (yes, I believe it was a whole week to 10 days past that time :-( Amazon, should be more careful when selecting its providers. I highly recommend the backpack but would advise to purchase it directly from the company or other distributor other than ANTOnline.com."
2,This would be way better as a calender,"I bought this book looking to understand the key concepts and practices of Taoism, something I had studied in various world religion courses. I was incredibly disappointed because it was so boring. I am an avid reader, and the truth is the ONLY way to read this is a page at a time, then set it down. I can't stand that. I want to keep reading, but there is not a general flow from page to page. THat having been said, if you are able to read a page and then sit back and contemplate, it's terrific, although I suggest having a general knowledge of what Taoism is before reading the ways in which it is applied. Why? Because it is applied to everything! If it had been on one of those ""new word a day"" calenders, it would be far more enticing. ""What should I consider today to reground myself in reality within the inter-collective framework of the universe?"""
1,Pure BS,"This ""ancient one"" gives Taoism a bad image.He is a Saturday Night Live skit buffoon.He is as enlighted as my morning turd."
3,Have To Agree With The Previous Reviewer,This book is completely lacking in its references to insects and has almost nothing to do with entymology.
2,A grave disappointment,"I have passionatly loved every book in this series and in the junior companion series until I read this one. Why?First because this book changes the tone of the series and has zero joy anywhere inside it.Second because it's ending cheaply nullifies the journey of the heroine to pull the author out of the paradox he put himself into in the second (vastly superior) novel. Duncan is a masterful writer and after the first two novels he set expectations for this book very high.But mainly it is because the heroine is such a useless tool and you have to live with her for 300 pages! You have to try and evoke some sort of compassion for your main character, but in this book he failed miserably.His next book in this series, Paragon Lost, is due out in October 2002. I hope it will erase this book from my mind and recapture the glory of the first two novels as well as the delight you find in the King's Daggers companion novels."
3,Not very exciting,"The third book in the series does not come close to guilded chain but neither did Lord of the Fire lands. One thing that niether book 2 or 3 did was follow the Blades! I dont mind the lack of action in this book but they are all called, ""tale of the kings blades."" Why? Sky of Swords definetely took my imagination for a ride the way the first two did, but I just wish the last two books would have followed the blades more then just having them be subplot. On to Chronicles!"
4,Wonderful!,"An outstanding story of loyalty, love, honor, conjuring and deception. A story of a king and a swordsman bonded to the king by sorcery. This story follows the bond between the king and his swordman and the dangerous missions faced. This book shows how people are played as pawns in the game of thrones. The characters are well developed and the story is a little dark but well done. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy. All I can say is that I couldn't wait to finish it to find out what happens. I couldn't wait to read the 'Lord of the Firelands' and 'Sky of Swords'. The other two titles are the same story from another point of view, but don't be put off by that, they are great stories as well with a wonderful twist!"
3,A bit too much trickery,"Like a number of other reviewers, I was interested to see how Duncan would resolve the discrepancy between ""The Gilded Chain"" and ""The Lord of the Fire Lands.""Unfortunately, without giving too much away, he uses an overt ""deus ex machina,"" or in this case, ""deus ex octagram"" device.The good news is all is set right in the end. The bad news is that you have to live through a real Gotterdaemmerung to get there--and when all is resolved, I, at least, was left feeling rather manipulated.However, the book is well-written, and Malinda is an interesting character--Duncan has worked hard in this trilogy to give us three very different protagonists. It is just too bad that he essentially has to pull a rabbit out of the hat to bring the trilogy to closure."
3,Slow to Unfold,"I found the book a little slow to unfold. I considered not finishing it at one point, but I am glad I did continue to read. The last half of the book is a much better and more engaging read. I would say overall it is a slightly better than average Fantasy."
4,King's Blades series,"I read The Gilded Chain a couple of years ago and thought it perhaps one of the top five books I have ever read (in 22 years or so). Well, I reread it a couple of weeks ago and I enjoyed it as much (possibly more) than I did the first time. I also enjoyed Lord of the Fire Lands (second in the series). Not as much as GC, though I was intrigued by the alternate ending. I think I missed Durendal (What a character!)....maybe I will like it better the second time around. I also was apprehensive about Sky of Swords due to some moderately bad press posted. However, Sky of Swords was excellent. Malinda evolved into a quite likable and courageous heroine and her Blades were almost on par with Wolfbiter and Quarrel (from The Gilded Chain). I enjoyed the time twists you used to make the story different than the usual fare. All the twists and turns were why I decided to read GC again. I'm currently reading The Reluctant Swordsman by Mr. Duncan and it is proving to be as good as I hoped."
1,Forget it,Don't waste your money. This book is nothing but a lot of psychological hyperbole. Only a psychologist could make such extravagant exaggerations regarding the most minor moments of a person's life.
3,"""Without a ... writing sytem, music could exist only in the present tense""","I never gave a thought to the system of written music or its inventor; the system of notes and clefs and staves seems so much bigger than one person could create. And yet, our system of musical notation was developed in the 10th century by an Italian monk from the tiny Tuscan town of Arezzo. This picture book biography explains the how and the why of Guide d'Arezzo's invention, including the struggles he had to go through to convince choirmasters and others that there was any benefit to written music. A fascinating story for musicians and non-musicians alike. The only fault I have with this book are the torn-paper collages. The scenery and backgrounds are lovely, but the human figures are so primitive and clunky looking that it detracts from the story."
5,a fun survey which will reach fiction and nonfiction readers alike.,"If you can read musical notes you can sing or play any piece - but there was a time when songs had to be memorized lest they be forgotten. It was Guido d'Arezzo whose efforts lead to the sheet music records we have today, and his biography and challenges are here presented in a lively fictional form backed by solid facts. Kids in grades 2-4 will appreciate the fun, lively chatty format of DO RE ME: IF YOU CAN READ MUSIC, THANK GUIDO D'AREZZO: a fun survey which will reach fiction and nonfiction readers alike."
3,Good for a Tutorial,This is an OK book for a intro level tutorial. From reading some of the other reviews here I bought it thinking it would be what I needed. If you want indepth information on using Robo Help this book is not it. All functions are not covered just basic ones are.
2,Not worth the money!!!,"My kids enjoy the concept of this hoop, but it is VERY poorly construction. First, it doesn't fit on the frame with a net in place. Second, the hoop completely sags downward when fully inflated; fun for dunks, impossible for actually shooting. I got mine cheap and my kids are enjoying it, but I would have been very disappointed if I paid anywhere near full price."
5,GOD IS GOOD,"THIS CD IS THE BOMB IT IS AWESOME. YOU CAN FEEL THE HOLY SPRIRIT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO IT. VERY SONG IS A BLESSING. I LIKE VERY SONG ON IT. YOU GOT TO GET IT. I WAS TRULY BLESS BY THIS CDYES GOD HAS ""JUST BEEN SO GOOD"". I LISTEN TO TO THIS CDEVERYDAY ON MY WAY TO WORK.KEEP DOING GOD'S WORK PROFESSOR FELDERGOD BLESS"
2,The Usual Suspects,"This book has designs that aren't really any different than the other Kooler books. That said, I bought it anyway, to add it to my collection. There is a snowman alphabet sampler that is cute, but I'd really rather do the snowmen without the letters. There are the usual cutesy teddy bears, etc. Most of the designs would fall under the ""cutesy"" or ""sweet"" description. I hate to say it, but I've seen better designs. If you have a huge collection, this book probably won't add anything new to your design portfolio. If you're just starting, I'd pick something with a wider variety of designs."
2,Liked it but didn't work,"I liked this book a lot at first. In fact, I remember saying that it was the best book I'd ever read, but when I actually tried the techniques of how to talk about things, it didn't work at all and led to a huge, disastrous fight. My husband suggested I readHow to Improve Your Marriage Without Talking About Itwhich he'd heard about on TV. I thought it sounded ridiculous, but I got it, and actually it worked a lot better for us."
4,Good Stuff,"As a therapist and a married person I find Terry Real's work to be extremely helpful. It is practical direct and hopeful. The many case examples and real examples of what ""to do"" are very useful. This book is easily read by therapists and lay people alike. Its an easy read and I recommend it."
5,WOW,"This book is amazing. Actual steps and language to help couples discuss and work through really important issues. Makes sense to both male and female. Great ""case studies"" examples of principles in action. Really really like this book."
5,Knows what he's saying,"I saw Terrence Real on the TV program ""Life, Part Two"". There was a panel of several marriage counselors who themselves had been married a long time. The host was asking each to provide insights about keeping a relationship healthy. I was very impressed by Terrence Real's comments, and decided to read some of his work. I liked the book so much that I bought several copies to share with my adult children. I think his advice makes a lot of sense. Note: the book is for relationships that do not include violence or addictions."
5,He's the best!,"I purchased this book after reading ""I Don't Want to Talk About It"" by Terry Real. The first book was eye-opening but left me wondering what I could do to better my situation. This book gives you the tools to improve your relationship!"
2,"Great theme, but not great fiction","I completely sympathize with the message of this novel: global warming is an urgent problem which people and governments -- especially in America -- should seriously address. But the novel doesn't work as fiction. The characters are wooden and lack credibility; the dialogue is cliche-ridden and unconvincing. It reads exactly like a political tract masquerading as a novel. I never had the sense that the writer got INSIDE his characters and really felt them as individuals with unique desires and histories and quirks. I never got a sense of ANY of the characters really FEELING the horrifying and sad reality of what a runaway greenhouse effect would mean. Instead, it was as if they were all mouthpieces for the author. But if that's all they are, it would have been better if Burns had simply written an essay or nonfiction book."
2,Beautiful but tiny,I guess I thought this mug would be a little bigger despite the description. It is very small.
2,not good,I purchased this item and the first time I went to clean it the film type coating that keeps it from sliding around the screen of my pda started peeling off. It looked bad so I rubbed all the film off and now the cover slides around on the pda screen. Still offers protection to the pda screen but moves around.
5,Great Sounds,These birds are wonderful with individual sounds but one of my dogs keeps breaking them because he's tired of the repeated bird calls! They are so cute and the other dogs love them and take care of them. Bad dog!
3,Not as bad as some people may think,"I read the reviews about this book and braced myself for the worst. I was all set to put my book up for sale, but I'm glad I'm able to form my own opinion. I thought this book was pretty good. The book is about three women, Lisa, Sundee and Danielle. All of these women are in various stages of relationships and self discovery. Sundee just married is dealing with having to share her life, but not lose herself in the process. Lisa is looking for love, and thinks she finally finds it. Danielle is a married woman who has an affair. Basically they don't realize how good their life is until the bad times roll in. It's a good read."
2,"Yada, Yada, Yada... Whatever","This book and its characters annoyed me to no end! To compare it to ""Waiting to Exhale"" is an overexaggeration -- BIG TIME. More than halfway through the book, I found myself checking to see how many pages were left. I didn't care about these characters at all. The sympathy factor was at zero very early. They brought their circumstances upon themselves because they were selfish, illogical and horny. It was a stretch to find admirable qualities in these characters (Danielle was well-educated and did her job well... most of the time; Lisa was dedicated to her students; at least Sundi tried to make her stupid marriage work and I wished I could buy one of her baskets). I only finished it because my girlfriend, who I borrowed it from, wanted to know my opinion of the book. I can only say I'm glad I borrowed it instead of buying it."
4,Easy Reading that speaks to the mind,"I really enjoyed the friendships between two sisters and their shared best friend. The moments in each ones' life was exemplifying. Mrs. Berry touched on alot about forgein marriage, everyday marriage situations and living the single life. I really enjoyed this novel and hope to hear from this author again."
4,Entertaining & Full of Emotions,There are few books that I feel that as if I know the characters. I actually found myself getting mad at some of the characters in this book(and that ususualy doesn't happen). There were parts of this book that I laughed(out loud) as well as cried. This book is thourougly entertaining. I've told all my friends about SO GOOD and that they had to go and get it!!!!!
2,SO BAD!,THIS BOOK WAS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ BY FAR. AND BELIEVE ME I CAN READ A BOOK IN ONE NIGHT IF THE STORY LINE IS GOOD. IF THIS IS ALL SHE HAS TOO OFFER I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BOOK OF HERS AGAIN. THE HOLES AND MISTAKES I FOUND IN HER STORY LINE ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION. BUT GIVE ME A BREAK THESE SISTERS WERE ALL IN HEAT.IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE ON A SERIOUS HUNT. NOT TO MENTION LOOKS WERE THEIR PRIMARY QUALIFICATIONS IN A MAN. THE ENDING WAS A JOKE. I ONLY FINISHED IT TO SEE HOW IT WOULD PLAY OUT. MS. BERRY I HOPE YOU NEXT BOOK HAS MORE SUBSTANCE THAN THIS IN ANY CASE THE ONLY WAY I WOULD READ IT IS IF IT WERE GIVEN TO ME. AND EVEN THEN I WOULD GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT
2,Disappointing...,"Hello. Is there anyone else out there who was just sorely disappointed with this book? The characters did not move me at all, the plot was sufficatingly familiar, and I barely even finished the book. I was totally angry that I spent money on this book. To compare her to Terry McMillan is a travesty. I'm sorry, I'm usually not this critical, but hopefully, the next book by this author will have more depth and insight."
3,I was enjoying the story until.....,"You put into print that the black educated and ambitous woman is literally killing the black family. She's having fewer babies and raising them less attentively and not taking proper care of her black man. I couldn't believe my eyes that you would write such a thing in a story of African American women struggling to have good/strong relationships with African American men, and you blame it on us being to educated and ambitous. What are we supposed to be barefoot and pregnant. Was that the message you were trying to send? What are these men doing while we are having babies and waiting on them?"
1,So Good Was No Good,"This book had no substance, it seemed to be one of the many books trying to be the next ""Waiting To Exhale"". I thought the ending was pretty bad, too. Instead of reinforcing the myth that all a woman needs to be happy is a man, Lisa should've tried to find fulfillment within herself. But that's just my opinion. Perhaps I'm just bitter because I didn't appreciate the comment Ms. Berry made about left handed people."
2,not what I thought,"I love circulon pans and have a set of them. I mistakenly purchased these ciculon elite pans and they are not like the circulon classic. The classic pans are so easy to use and clean with a quick wipe. These do not sit evenly on the burner, they are harder to clean and they don't heat as well. Get the classic."
1,disappointed with this product,"I have had other Circulon products and have never had problem with them before. But this skillet set really dispointed me, so much that it prompted my very first product review ever.I used the skillet mostly for grilled cheese sandwitches. A couple of weeks after I started using the skillet, I noticed that the sides of the skillet started to accumulate sticky brown substance that's really hard to clean. I made extra effort to try to keep them clean, but I was losing the battle (and it shouldn't be this much work to keep non-stick cookwares clean). Two months later, the bottom of the skillet started to stick. I have never had any non-stick cookware that lasted such an short period of time.I do like the look and feel of this skillet - the deep sides makes the skillet more versatile."
4,A Really Good Pan,"It's really a good pan, not too heavy but you might consider not using it on very high heat. I had an Anolon similar to this which is heavy and I use it to do my eggs and if you leave it for sometime or forgot it on high heat, it won't burn. But still, I uses this a lot because it's light and easy to handle."
2,"10-inch Pan WON""T BALANCE","so I just got these pans, went to go cook, and the 10-inch one is not balanced and TIPS off the burner. The handle is too heavy and it just pulls the pan to the side. This is not only annoying but can really cause a BIG accident!!! The smaller one, 8-inch, doesn't seem to have this problem... but day 1 NOT good."
1,Not Safe,"The handles are to heavy for such little skillets. The skillets tend to tip up. In our case, it was grease."
2,Dealbreaker,"I've had this set for a year and a half and It's held up well. However, it is only because of my cheapness and the fact that I have yet to be ""badly"" injured that I don't replace it.Overall, great pans. Very non stick, even heating and all I could look for in a 8"" and 10"" set.BUT THE 10"" HAS A FATAL FLAW.The larger pan is terribly off balance with the handle being way too heavy for the pan causing it to OFTEN FLIP BACK AND FALL OFF THE STOVE.I have had this happen many times and have learned that there are few things scarier in the kitchen than a hot pan with hot oil falling off the stovetop. Thankfully, I'm usually able to catch and rebalance it - but not always.If it were for the fact that I fear for my feet and floor every time I cook, this would be a great pan. But sadly, I have to recommend that you DO NOT BUY this pan."
1,The handle is too heavy! It's very dangerous!,"I love Circulon's Contempo fluted skillets. I used them for two years and had no problems. They are non-sticky, well shaped and very scratch-resistant. But this Elite set is a disaster. It is VERY unstable and can overturn easily. The problem is in its handle. It's way too heavy and pulls the whole skillet down even if there is food in the skillet. I wonder if any safety control was done for the product. It's a very dangerous fault."
3,Really not sure....,"I was anxious to order and start using my nonstick 8"" and 10"" deep skillets! This is my first experience with anodized nonstick cookware. I do like the sizes and depth of the cookware. I have not used them enough to add more of a review.My first experience with the 8"" skillet wasn't what I expected, as my eggs seemed to stick, so......"
3,Circulon is a great brand,"I have a whole set of my own, but I bought these as a gift for my sister in law, purchased from the amazon outlet so you get what you pay for, it was a great price but when I received it, it appears as though the larger frypan had been dropped on the floor as it was dented and not so round anymore... but the pans themselves are great - the only brand I will buy - dishwasher safe - wont warp and as long as you dont use metal utensils - you dont have to worry about scratches/etc"
5,CAN'T BE BEAT!!!,"These pans are GREAT!!!!Cook evenly and without any oils,butter or anything.Best I have ever cooked with.In time it is all I will own.EVERYONE should buy these.And you can't beat the price."
4,Perfect replacement,This set replaced a moderately priced cuisinart pair that i had. I didn't want cheap and flimsy nor pay the high end price. These are just right. Real non-stick. Clean up nicely.
3,non-stick awesome; balance problems,The non-stick part of this pan is perfect. Works like a charm. My only complaint is that it tilts off the burner due to the handle weight (occurs with an empty pan or light-weighted food). This is really dangerous with a hot pan. I'll need to search out and purchase some type of weight attachment to balance pan so it won't tilt off burner.Another viewer mentioned sticky film on pan - this comes from certain oils and non-stick sprays.
5,Great Pans,"Had my 1st set for 6 years. My own fault for putting them through the dish washer and stacking them in the cupboard. Even with my rough use they lasted that long and the surface just started to peel. Hand wash these and use wood or plastic in the pans and they will last even much longer. Great pans, great quality."
5,Great twin pack,The usual excellent quality from Circulon. Sizes are perfect for the 2 person household.
1,Description Needs Editing,Instead of 10-inch should be 9 1/2 inch. Should state skillet has humorous oblong shape instead of tired looking circular shape.
5,This is my daughter's favorite book ever,"My daughter recently turned 9 years old and this has been her favorite book for several years, ever since she was old enough to pick it up and read it on her own. It was so amazing to see her at only 6 or 7 years old picking up this book and reading it for fun. She loves to read and reads a variety of books, but if you ever ask her what her favorite book is, she invariably mentions this book. The illustrations are very cute, and each entry is a short paragraph which is nice for children who often have short attention spans. We highly recommend this book!"
2,Cute pictures coupled with a hard-left bias,"The Industrial Revolution paints factory owners as over-priviledged, and lauds things like taxpayer-funded ""free"" schools, welfare, and labor unions as improvements in people's lives.In discussing ""Looking after the land,"" the book claims ""People destroy plants, birds and animals when they dump poisonous wastes,"" and ""Fumes from factories and car exhausts pollute the air."" This little blurb even depicts a man nearby factory smokestacks, wearing a pollution mask while walking his dog, who is also wearing a mask. Nowhere do they mention vast improvements made in reducing pollution in first-world countries and that our air is getting cleaner, or that most pollution is now being created in developing countries too poor to dwell on the niceties of eco-consciousness.Getting the picture?"
4,A Must Have for Fans of the Television Show,"My daughter is a huge Thomas fan, and she loves all of the Read To Me paperbacks. Because the books tell stories from the television series, we read these books at times when my daughter is asking to watch Thomas, but he isn't on. My daughter loves how the illustrations are actual still photographs from the television series. However, sometimes the photos shown don't really depict what is going on in the story. There are a lot of words in these books, with small print. These are definitely books little kids would not be able to read on their own, but they can enjoy the pictures on their own. It is wonderful how each book is comprised of 3 or 4 short stories that toddlers have no problem holding their attention through."
2,Way too wordy,"I found these stories to be way too wordy and confusing. I think they may have been transcribed word for word from the video which makes it rather hard to follow. For the price it may be worth it for a small child just to look at the pictures, but otherwise I would try to find something with a lot less words."
2,Beware,I don't like that amazon has pop up of Please Read To Me series in with Pictureback Readers and other formats. They are all very different. See Cranky Day review.
2,"Such potential, but goes flat","I really wanted to like this book and read it through to the end, even though I probably should have abandoned it. It took several weeks which is saying something...The library has the book marked as romance, but it is not very romantic. Characters are flat, boring details, predictable story. There were even times when I read passages and couldn't understand what the author was trying to say...especially when she would say something like ""He threw his head back and laughed..."" I would have to re-read it to find out what was funny and was still left wondering. Some great options for historical fiction are Gilbert Morris, DeAnne Gist, or Lori Copeland."
2,Blahhhh,"I thought this book was going to be sooo great! I love Hake and that back sounded awsome. The character,Ruth, in the begining even sounded so intreseting but then it was so boring. It just died in the middle. Even before the middle. Why was there so much on secondary characters when there was absolutly no point. There was no spark between the two main characters by the time the ended up together i was so bored with them. Josh had like no emotions either. he was so even on one line it was wierd! If i'd known it was going to be soo flat I wouldnt have bothered, read Measure of a Lady much more Intresting."
3,Strong Plot with Engaging Romance,"A good clean romance book that will fetch the hearts of most readers. Those who enjoy romance, of any kind, will appreciate Hake's strong plot and lovable characters. Ruth, though clumsy, has faults for being impulsive and not by her outward quirk of clumsiness which help drive her decisions good and bad that delight the reader. As an atheist I was surprised by how much I liked this book. I do not enjoy too many references to god and even though she seems to say it one too many at times that it disrupted the pacing even people like myself will ignore it and appreciate the characters' strong faith which helps case this book together. I had no idea this was a series until this review but I hope to purchase the rest. You must check Letter Perfect out!"
5,"One of three books by this author included in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"".","This book is one of three by this author selected for inclusion in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" which is published by America Reads Spanish: a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US. The review states: ""Journalist and author Poniatowska based this testimonial novel on a series of interviews conducted with an indigenous woman who recounted her difficult struggle to survive in modern-day Mexico."""
5,Best hair dryer,"This is my second... this dryer is awesome and inexpensive. Really light and drys well. The comb(pik) attachment that the dryer comes with is great, the teeth are super short so they will not break or tangle in hair."
4,good value,"liner fits perfect and keeps the dirt off the carpet. It seems to be real sturdy and will last. It comes rolled in a box, and takes a couple days to smooth out, but looks like it was a custom add on from the dealer."
4,a Pacifist look,"I picked up this book because I enjoyed Ms. Llywelyn's book on Brian Boru, the great king of Ireland. This book grabbed my attention immediately because it begins with action...By the end of the book, not all my questions about the characters were answered, and not all the situations were resolved, but I thought that was an adequate commentary on the turbulent times the characters were living in.Not knowing much about the period, I thought the book was well written and the characters were beautifully drawn--real and fictional (or were they fictional?). I had a sneaking suspicion that the author was related, somehow, to the main characters in the book---but maybe it was just coincidence that her grandparent's names were the same.Anyway, a good book...enjoy!"
5,1921,"I agree, this was a book that kept me on edge. The historical content was excellent, and the story line kept the book all too real, to the point that I felt geniune angre and heart ache through many portions of the book. I too would very much like to continue the story, and I am quite anxious for the next bit of history! As I told everyone about this book, it feeds my passion and stirs a hunger!"
4,Revolution in Ireland -- Sorting it out,"1921 is a dandy -- informative, as well as a great read. Llywelyn clears up the confusion that many experience in trying to sort out the different revolutionary groups in Ireland in the early years of the 20th century, as well as draw the reader into the motives for why Irish men and women divided over the tactics of Arthur Griffith, Patrick Pearse, Michael Collins and Eamon DeValera. Her work is comparable to the efforts of Jose Maria Gironella in reference to the Spanish Civil War. She knows why -- and illustrates why -- good men differed on the tactics to be employed in seeking independence. The reader will not be disappointed."
4,Good book,"Morgan Llywelyn is my favorite author. Her books manage to weave a spell around you, attaching you personally to the characters, so your overjoyed, or heartbroken with each of the events in the characters life, as one of their friends would be. 1921 is no exception. The only flaw was the ending, I felt it was very anticlimatic. In fact, the booked climaxed after about the first hundred pages, every thing else seemed like more of a history lesson. I still do recommend it though."
4,God bless the Irish,Morgan Llywelyn does an out standing job of blending history and fiction.This second book in her series on the Irish struggle for freedom is outstanding. She tells the truth about the Civil War with all its facts and heartbreaking events and keeps you very evolved in the lives of the fictional personalitiesshe creates.
4,"An essential read if you liked ""1916""","An essential read if you liked Llywelyn's ""1916"", this sequel picks up with the same characters in the same push for Irish freedom. As with ""1916"", her ""1921"" is heavy on accurate historical events and people while using the story of a small number of fictional characters to carry the story line.Excellent storytelling, excellent scholarship. It's fascinating to watch the appearance and rise of such key characters in Irish history as Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins, and watch how the nature of the Irish revolution and the British political dealings contribute to the civil war.A heartbreaking story about the path to ultimate victory. And Ursula (""Precious""), introduced in ""1916"" and coming into her own in ""1921"", may be one of the most compelling characters to be found in historical fiction. Now I must read the next volume in the ""Irish Century"" series - ""1949"""
4,Hello,"Hello, the Camera digital Sony Cybershot DSCW200 is excellent and with good resolution.Is not Touch panel"
1,Sony DSCW200 vs T-100,Both the Sony W200 and Sony T100 cost about the same money.From Cnet.com (on the Sony W200) ...>>> Requires far more light for low ISO shots than most competitors; exceptionally long flash-recycle time and disappointing shot-to-shot performance; image-processing artifacts; LCD has poor off-angle viewing; proprietary USB cable. <<<Cnet.com professional rating for Sony W200: 6.4Cnet.com Professional rating for Sony T100: EDITOR'S CHOICE 2007 !!!!!!!
2,Horrible battery life and memory,The battery life for the AA that this camera takes only lasts for about fifteen minutes of use and the memory on the camera alone only holds five pictures before its full.
5,Gorgeous!,"I am crazy about this camera! I am NOT a professional photographer, but I've got to say, I take GREAT pictures with this camera. Very easy to use, small, compact, and takes good video."
2,Terrible photo quality,"My husband surprised me with this camera on Valentines day in 2007. I was excited to have a small camera. After taking multiple photos I realized they all lacked clarity. We sent the camera in to Sony and had it sent back to us (supposedly they ""fixed"" it) . The photos still looked awful. We returned it and purchased a Canon which had much better clarity. Meanwhile, my sister purchased the Sony Cybershot and I noticed all of her photos lacked clarity as mine had. She never seemed to notice though. I don't know if I am just more picky about clear images then others, but I always thought her photos were awful. Since then I have stuck with etiher Canon or Olympus and I see a huge difference in quality."
5,My favorite camera,This has been the best camera I have ever owned. I love it's small and portable size (I pretty much take it everywhere) and the pictures are crisp and beautiful. I rarely have to do much post processing because they really turn out wonderful straight out of the camera.I would be lost without my little cybershot buddy!
2,Gregory Bardakos,"For the $10. I think I spent a waste of money. They are cut to high to the ankle and not that good around the foot. Give them a try, I know you will agree with me. G"
4,Good Book for rapid reading,This book is likely to help a lot even if you have little time for prep. The tpoics are well covered and the examples adequetely solved. I do wish there were more structure problems solved.Can Buy.
5,Awesome!,"Had this disc existed and had I heard it back when I was a kid--or even when I was a teenager--I would have thought it to be hopelessly square schmaltz. Now that I am older and more open to things outside my immediate cultural heritage and comfort zone, I find myself awed by its beauty and sincerity. Try it--you may like it!"
4,replacement filter,The filter fits and works like the original but cost quite a bit less. I'm happy.
5,Water filter,These water filters are great. I used one and only had to replace the filter once in 2 years of use while living in Bolivia
3,How do they expect you to pack it?,"They work fine, but they're very fragile. I wish MSR would include some kind of hard case with them, instead they're packed in a flimsy, bulky cardboard box. I'm surprised they survived the shipping. How do they expect you to pack them in a backpack and be sure they won't get broken while hiking? Kinda silly if you ask me. 5 stars for product working as it should, minus two stars for not thinking ahead. Now I have to go figure out what to pack the thing in."
5,"2 is 1, 1 is none","If you buy the pump, you might as well as get another filter just in case. It is a little bulky, but I wont take the chance of not having a backup."
2,Watch out! breakable,"Mfg. provided no specific instructions on how to install filter and I broke the ceramic insert on install, in the field, rendering useless and ruining the backcountry trip."
3,not as tedious as actually reading Little Women,"The main character has a distant scholar father and a practical New England mother who decides to become an antique dealer; they are divorcing. The main character (Brooke?) is writing a paper on Louisa May Alcott and visits Concord, Mass with her devoted sort of boyfriend. In the course of her research, she decides that Louisa May Alcott's adored dad was selfish and unsuccessful and realizes that her sturdy practical boyfriend and sturdy practical mother are more valuable than she first knew. I wouldn't say that this book was enjoyable for me but it was well-written as all of Betty Cavanna's books are and it was different from my own experiences with some new information. I imagine that this must be one of the author's less popular titles. I inexplicably ended up with a bunch of Betty Cavanna's more obscure titles which I read just to read them. I'm not sure I can recommend this book. It made me not feel any urge to visit Massachusettes."
5,Excellent historical Atlas,"A must have in any collection about History. Maps are detailed and precise, covering all of western history since the early empires in Mesopotamia up to 1929."
5,Great book,Gives very interesting insight into the similarities and differences of the 2 faiths. It is well written and easily read
1,Shoddy remastering...,"The song selection is ok i suppose, but the mastering is terrible. But what more would yo expect from an import label without access to the original master recordings? If you want a great Bing Crosby compilation, it's best to go with one of the official releases by Decca/MCA or Columbia/Sony. If you prefer the Crosby from the early 1930's, get The Essential Bing Crosby: The Columbia Years"" put out by Sony/Columbia. If you prefer the mid 30's to 1950's Crosby, there are countless options from Decca/MCA, the best of which is probably ""A Centennial Anthology"" which is a great 2-disc collection. The sound quality is far superior to anything you'll find on this set."
3,the quest nears it's end!,"""those who swear by the runestaff must then benefit or suffer from the consequences of the fixed pattern of destiny that they set in motion"" - and Baron Meliadus of kroiden had sworn such an oath : vengeance against the castle Brass - that Yisselda count Brass's daughter would be his.Dorian Hawkmoon had of course been invloved in those wild and uncanny adventures nearing their end."
3,Ok. Not able to open enough...,Can't get this regulator to output more than 45 psi. Other than that it is fine. Kinda cheap but fine for the price.
5,A Visionary Book,This book by Otto Tien-Pok Xing is visionary. It provides practical guides for the Chinese government that makes a lot of sense. Most people know that this is the Asian century -- people in economic think tanks have written about it. Mr. Xing's insightful book shows the pitfalls that China will have to wade through to make that a reality.
1,Asians are not the 'master race',"This is by far the worst book I've ever read. The idea that any one race of people is superior to another is morally repugnant. The idea that Asians will dominate the world and its economies is simply absurd.China may well be a fast growing economy; however, this is due to the presence of many industrial spies operating, often disguised as students, in Europe and the United States, who send back technological information to be copied. In recent times, China has failed to produce any original ideas or inventions. It appears as if all China's technological advances have been based upon 'stolen' and plagiarised western ideas.The only way for China to overhaul the west in terms of creativity and economic strength is to overthrow the communist regime and embrace democratic and capitalist principles i.e. free markets.Avoid at all costs."
3,Erotic!,"I found the book to be intresting and entertaiment. The book is about racism and sex in a time when blacks were being victims of lynchings and Jim Crowe laws that deprived them of their human rights. Today if they make this book into a movie, it will be only shown in the art movie circut. William Inge dilevers an honest point when it comes to sex and unwanted advances.My email:Carcej@lycos.com"
4,The Scotch-Irish: A Social History,I have been curious about my ancestors. This was a realistic view from which I come. It was a pleasure to read and find answers to some unanswered questions.
2,scotch is a drink not a people moron,This author seems to hav it in for the Scots Irish. The title Scotch Irish in itself is awful as Scotch is a drink not the title of the Scots. The book is an obvious hack job
3,"accurate, informative but prejudicial","informative reading with accurate dates and occurances but with heavey overtones of blatened prejudice against the ulster-scotts. i.e. the ulster-scott's were not the land hungery, land grabbers that the author makes them out to be. they were simply following the orders/directions of the local governing bodies to advance and intrude into 'protected indian lands'. i suggest you read with an open mind and remember that the subjective views of the auther are anti ulster-scott."
2,Scotch?,"I thought it was Scots? not Scotch? Would someone enlighten me? I thought scotch was slightly derrogatory and referred to someone who was overly thrifty or perhaps stingy. Maybe this book is about stingly Irishmen?I was about to order this book; haven't but was forced to rate it. Can't order a book calling the Scots ""Scotch"" unless someone tells me this is correct."
3,"Nice, but nothing new","Elliott Smith has the kind of voice, and sound that I love, love. It's the soft, simplistic, soul music ( think Cary Brothers, James Blunt, Mat Kearney) that I just love. I could listen to four hours.His music while nice, is so similiar to a million other songs like this, is nothing new. Unfortunately, this has been done, too many times. I wish he had a little more original take on his bluesy, melancholy sound.His Miss Mistery reminds me so much of the Cary Brother's blue eyes that it's hard to listen too. I like the Cary Brothers better than this guy. But, if you're like me and you just can't get enough of this bar blues, depressing music ( and i mean that as complimentary) than this album will do."
4,"Elliott Smith, Great as always","For those who are fans of Smith's music or are new to it, this is a good album. Fans of E.S. will know most of these songs, but it's still a treat to hear since he was taken from this earth too soon. A great collection of his work.Matt ZarnstorffZarnstorff"
5,Fanastic release!!!,"I have heard these songs before but never so clear an crisp. It is a gift to hear these songs in this light and I recommend any fan of Elliott to pick up this album. I particularly recommend the track ""Going Nowhere"" as it is truly haunting and completely introspective. If you love Elliott, this is a must have!"
4,Elliott Elliott Elliott,Elliott Smith rocks my world. It's too bad to have lost a talent like his. This cd captures his sound very personally and raw. A good double-disc collection.
5,Gone Too Soon,"I love this collection. It's like two lost albums were found. Some of his most beautiful and haunting material. The world lost a brilliant songwriter when Elliott passed away. His death is as important to me as John Lennon's (if you knew me, you'd know that that means alot in my world); they both could have gone on to contribute so much more to the world. Maybe they're somewhere playing together right now. That would be cool."
2,Tough read for this novice,"This book was chock full of details, but a tough read for me(novice). I probably need to re-skim after I have digested the info. It is probably more suited for more experienced individuals.Ed S.[...]"
1,Disappointing read,"The book does not live up to its title - most of its information is theoretical and uses examples not relative to the person who would read this book - i.e. smaller business owners. It is a scholarly overview of the process but for a do-able, step by step approach, I found it highly inferior to John Gross's ""Fundamentals of Maintenance"" - just because it is written in more difficult language does not make it a better book. Gross pointed out, and I agree, that people talk ABOUT preventative maintenance and the benefits for your company, but no one tells you how to actually set up a department or actual procedures. This is that type of a book - all research and very little actual, personal experience. Bypass this one."
1,Diary of a Radical Mermaid,"I absolutely loved ""Alice at Heart"". It was a beautiful, lyrical story with five haunting love stories intertwined. I could not wait to read ""Diary"". What a let-down. It's hard to believe the same author penned both books. In fact, I am inclined to believe Smith paid the high schooler down the street a few bucks to scratch out this cliche.You want to read a lovely, elegant novel: read ""Alice At Heart"". You want to read hackneyed tripe, read ""Diary of a Radical Mermaid."""
5,A great second installment!,"Diary of a Radical Mermaid was a wonderful second installment in the Waterlillies saga. It picked up right where Alice at Heart left off and for me, revisited the magnificent history, colors, tastes, smells and emotions that got me hooked in the first book! Romantic without being over the top, and exciting enough to keep me from putting the book down! I hope Deborah Smith continues this series, and I will be one of the first to pick up the third installment!"
5,Entertaining and Funny !,"I must disagree completely with previous reviewers who liked Alice at Heart but not this book. I liked Alice but could not put this down. It was funny, had some adventure and action, and just enough romance for those that enjoy that part of the story. I hope to see a sequel to this story and anxiously await learning more about Ms. Smith's Mer world and to see if Melasine, the Old One, will finally appear. Until then, I will remain a Floater ( read the book ) and hope for Book Three in the series."
2,SO DISAPPOINTED.....,"I had been looking forward to a sequel of ALICE AT HEART and was so disappointed in this book! I did not like Juna Lee at all. And the ""magic"" that was in the first book was missing in this one. Deborah - I love your books - they are some of my most favorite and most re-read. Please write another ""Alice"" book and bring back the ""magic""!"
3,Decent,"I thought that this book was a decent book, but I tended to gain very little from the brief fragments, which make up most of the book."
4,A fine book but to expensive,"This is a fantastic book. Sappho the name is famous. She talked about with great praise by other classic authors but her poetry is unknown to modern audiences. This book makes the point that the what exists of Sappho's poems/songs are really just fragments. In many cases only a few words exist with little or no context. The broken nature of these fragments is reinforced in the text by the use of blank space on the pages. The only problem is, I can't get over the feeling that I've paid for a full book and gotten a lot of blank pages."
4,Great Death Metal Album,"This is the follow up to 2004 Where Ironcrosses Grow, and it dosen't dissapoint. Not there best album but very heavy, good production, solo's are there, as are the riffs, and whait to you hear the instrumental Phamtons(Of The Oath)"
1,CD is too short!!!,"Ten songs -- barely 30 minutes on a compact disc that can hold nearly 80 minutes?? What a rip-off. No matter how great the material is (and it's all great here), music buyers should avoid this at all costs. A decent anthology would have AT LEAST 20 songs."
4,A Very Good Introduction to Luther,"If you want to understand Luther's thought, this is the book for you. I was surprised by the theological detail Paulson was able to bring to bear in this short book. It is not the easiest read, but reading this book is not the same as watching the movie with Ralph Fiennes. It may require a second read to really get the nuanced points Luther was attempting to make. Thank you Paulson for your excellent overview."
1,If you want something worthy of Luther's work look elsewhere,Hands down the worst book on Luther...or theology for that matter...I have ever read. I am not one to submit critical comments but after reading 3/4 of this book I couldn't take it any longer. This book seems less a serious study of Luther - his life and teaching - and more of a forum for the author to ponticifate his own beliefs.
3,Good Theology but Too Much Churchism,"Until the final chapters, I really enjoyed this book. The insights into Luther's uniique contributions to Christian thought, especially his reading of Paul that we are saved by faith and not by works was intellectually liberating.Unfortunately, the last chapters were focused on ritualism, especially communion, which is an exercise in going through the motions of observance that I believe Jesus would find pathetic and empty of meaning if he visited a church.And then there was the sort of academic concept that if one is at all serious about being a Christian, one must find a preacher who is certified by the powers that be or else the Good News will not take. All this seemed to be in service of church hierarchy and bureaucracy.So if you feature yourself as an armchair theologian, I would recommend reading this book but stopping at the final three chapters, which seem designed simply as propaganda for the current Lutheran Church."
1,More like a door stop,John Mortimer is a wonderful English author. My husband is a great fan of his work. I read of this book this summer in England and when I returned home I rushed to buy it.My husband hated it! He said he had already read most of the stories in other works. The author also gives his opinion on the wonderful Labor Party in England. His mother should have taught him not to discuss politics in polite society.It is really a dreadful book. Only useful as a door stop on a windy day.
1,For what it may be worth,"I read a little of this book and then found that I just didn't want to waste my time reading any more. And it sounded so interesting in the NYTimes review! I feel this book is pure garbage. He seems to be under the impression that every thought and memory which flits through his head is of great value. Just as power corrupts, fame insufflates the ego - unless you have the supreme wisdom to resist it. I read halfway thru another book called something like 'the delights of aging'. It was just as disappointing. And I'm aging. Are there any books which genuinely make you believe aging isn't as bad as it feels? Like that music isn't as bad as it sounds? Maybe self-delusion is the only way to joyfully tolerate the whips and scorns. Maybe that's Mortimer's real message here - message by example."
3,a fine day cream,"Although the cream did not refine my pores, it is very suitable as a day cream, where spf 15 is a must. The ingredients of retinol and glycolic acids are not in any significant amounts to cause irritation, but they are proven skin lubricants gentle enough for daily use."
2,70's Music revolution,"This is a great CD that contains songs from both Orchestra Lipua Lipua and Les Kamale featuring the great singer, Nyboma Muan'Dido.All the songs are fantastic. Outstanding cuts are Ndukidi with its amazing guitars and Asana Muana Maua showcasing Nyboma's vocals. The 70's were a very creative era for Congolese music and these 2 bands were ahead of the pack."
4,Down to earth,"I am currently in Session 1 in one of Sheila Kelley's dance studios, and this book reads very close to how my instructor teaches the class. Not too technical, literally how everyone speaks to one another. It makes it easier to work out at home as well because Sheila really breaks the moves down step by step. Granted, I don't have a pole at home, so I can't say that I would be able to teach myself any of the pole tricks, but for the floor routine it is a great buy. I am definitely going to look at her DVD's as well, just to have someone to ""follow along"" with."
5,Excellent,I'll make this short and simple: Excellent book and excellent DVD's; buy them. Best thing about the book is the encouragement. Read it over and over and BECOME!
5,Worth Every Penny!,"This is a great book. Sheila has outdone herself with this. I am a wife, I am also a mother of 4. Very rarely do I feel I am a woman who is worthwhile, appealing and desirable. This really has helped me find the woman who sometimes gets lost in the shuffle. I recommend also that you get a good yoga tape to help you learn to stretch etc. And if you really like the book, later you can get her video."
2,The S Factor: Strip Workouts for Every Woman,"This book was uninspiring. Once you thumb though it once, it is enough. Maybe the video is better, if you want to drop $75. I think verbal instruction and music would help. When you head is on the floor, looking up to read what is next, is when I got up and shut the book."
1,Not impressed,"I was disappointed with this book. There is no way that ""Every Woman"" can do these moves. Sure, if you are a Hollywood actress with access to a personal trainer...maybe you can do them. For those of us ""real"" women...I just don't see it.I thought it was a very bland book, black and white pictures of the author and some other not so ""real"" women. Beautiful, thin, young...not inspiring.I could have done without all the talk about female genitalia and how to shave it too. Just too much information there.."
5,This is GREAT!,"i couldnt live without this product. It is the hub of all my input devices. It feels a bit cheap but it works great. Allows me to watch dvds on my xbox , and choose between tv, xbox, OR whatever else u want to hook up to it. Its basicly a system selector, a game storage box, and a xbox dvd remote. I love it."
1,Turgid,"Long on jargon, short on substance. Many of the sentences are either undecipherable, or meaningless, or both."
3,"It's good, but there's a HUGE mistake","I recently bought this DVD a couple of weeks ago at Best Buy. Anyway, on the back label, it said that the episode ""Teacher's Pet"" was on it. It wasn't. The episode ""The Autograph"" was on it instead. But ""The Autograph is on the other Maya and Miguel DVD just like it says! I just wanted everyone to be aware of this mistake."
5,the clean way to cheat,Excellent game to cheat with. Its fun and the cleanest game cheat I've played. The codes are undetectable and most of all safe.
3,"Useful, yet no code updates available","The disc included here can be useful for a few missions where you keep dying by using the Infinite Health cheat but the AR MAX codes are not compattible with this disc, for example: the disc comes preloaded with all tags sprayed BUT does NOT come with all oysters, horseshoes, photographs taken, etc. While there is an AR MAX code for these, the disc simply won't accept them. Maybe better off getting an AR MAX or Gameshark for around 10 more dollars so it can be updated and used for more than one game."
2,Not the one you want,"Buy the other one, ""Razor Sharp"". It usually sells pretty cheap. This one ""Slick Tracks"" has a few good songs; and a lot of stinkers. Razor Sharp's first song is terrible, but the rest of that disc is a good value for fans of obscure classic or southern rock."
4,good book,"This book is almost identical to the one where Andrea Barry came to Pine Hollow. A gifted rider begins at the stable, is given extra attention by Max the trainer, and admiration from the other riders, and Carole gets jealous. Well, eventually, of course, she learns that being a green eyed monster doesn't pay, when she and the rider must work together to deliver a foal. You'd think Carole would have learned this lesson by now, but apparently not."
4,cool book,"I LOVE all horse books and have read all the Saddle Clubs and Thoroughbred books. This one was like the others, but since I know all the charactres so well it was fun to read. A REALLY good horse book and mystery is Shadow Horse. WAY cool and a good sumer read for fun."
4,Field Guide to Eucalypts Vol. 1 Southeastern Australia,"Have second edition updated 1999Good key, discussion of bark catagories, leaf phases, & other distinguishing features.For each tree has:Good photo of overall tree shape/formGood photo of bark characteristicsExcellent photo of budsome with bud and flower (maybe one out of 6-7 trees)Excellent photo of fruitVery few photos of leaves.Would have liked to see juvenile and mature leaves.Discussion of distribution gives clues to type of soil tree is adapted to.Would have liked to seen some comment if trees adapt to cultivation or are invasive etc.Overall, best Eucalyptus book I've seen to date."
4,Those where the days of...,"Genesis, ELP, Yes, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Moody Blues, Aphodites Child, etc... and the Italian bands that took part of the Progresive Rock movement. PFM and Le Orme stand out as the best in Italian progrock. This is a definite collection worth the name: Studio Collection. You had to be there, I was, and it was fun.[...]"
2,Disappointed,"I was also mislead by the advertising. It did not state that it was only music. No singing. They included the words, but that doesn't do anything.I am really disappointed and I am sorry I purchased this CD."
4,Courage & Calling : Embracing your God-Given Potential,This is a good book for any one decerning his/her vocation in life. I recommend it to young and old alike.
4,Colts Wrlcome Mat,"Mat is well made...logo is awesome...faded a little in the sun...overall, a great purchase (wanted to give it 5 stars but settled for 4!)"
1,NOT worth the wait,"For years, I've been hoping for another book by Rennie Airth. ""River of Darkness"" made an indelible impression on me. Alas, this was not worth the wait (sorry, Amazon editorial reviewer). It's essentially just another serial killer outing, setting notwithstanding, with all the cliches of that tired genre. When the character who will obviously be the next victim is introduced, I groaned. I hoped for a twist or two, but no. A serious disappointment and inferior to at least 100 of the 211 other books I've read this year, including those by William Lashner, John Lawton, Jacqueline Winspear (author of another post-WWI series), Daniel Silva, and the ever-wonderful Donna Leon."
3,Good not great,The second in a trilogy this story rejoins the lives of many of the people met in River of Darkness 10 years later. Although the story shares many of the dimensions that were enjoyable in River of Darkness I missed the interest the development of John Madden's character added. Nevertheless it sets the scene for and hints at storyline developments for the next.
2,"Disappointing, long-awaited sequel","As a huge fan of Airth's first novel, A River of Darkness, I was severely disappointed with this second John Madden mystery. The author hampers Madden's involvement by having him retire from Scotland Yard to manage a farm in Surrey with his family. His contribution to this mystery, which involves a brutal child killer, is thus marginal at best. He finds one of the first bodies and deals with the killer at the end, but other detectives, associated with Madden in the previous book, do most of the sleuthing. Airth creates a really nasty killer in this outing, and the unveiling of his true identity is a treat. Nevertheless, I wanted more John Madden, and any reader of this book would have to agree that his presence was surely lacking."
3,Good Procedural; 3.5 Stars,Essentially a well plotted procedural set in interwar England. The plot features a psychopathic serial murderer of children. Quality of plotting and writting is above average though not outstanding. Airth makes a not particularly successful effort to use the plot to prefigure WWII.
5,Dune kicks butt!,"Wow! This is just a really cool CD. All the songs are happy and very jumpy. Wherever you listen to it, it makes you want to get up and dance (it has happened to me) It's just really cool! Any techno fan must check this one out!!!!!"
1,Simple Country Pleasures,I did not care for this selection and returned the book. I felt it was not not as good as some of the other cookbooks that they offer. I would pass on this selection.
3,Cookbook,Definitely not the best cookbook I have in regards to Ky cooking! No great biscuit or roll recipes!! Wasn't impressed at all!
4,Pol Pot,"This is a very well informative book about the life and crimes of Pol Pot. It explains his childhood, his influences, and how he made his way in power. Though the book was a tough read and it didn't hold my attention very well. This book is obviously not for entertainment, but anyone who wants to learn about Pol Pot will want this book."
4,Black Hand Stand UP,"Grafh is without a doubt one of my favorite to listen to when it comes to punchlines and delivery. This mixtape is good but not great, it does however introduce you to his style so if you're interested its worth checkin out. If you want more I highly recommend gettin: The Bang Out, I Don't Care, The Oracle, The Classic, etc. (he usually make mixtapes with Clinton Sparks or Green lantern) These mixtapes listed above are a lot better than this particular release."
3,Awkward to load.,"The minute I opened this PackRight, I knew I would not be fond of it. Why? Because it opens towards the rear of the car. I knew that, but thought there would be a zipper or something that goes along the side to help with packing. Instructions say to load the carrier while it's on the roof. Unless your supplies are light, that's the only way to do it. With the opening facing backwards, it's very awkward to load. We tried it that way but gave up. Since we only had pillows, blankets, clothing and sleeping bags in there, my husband loaded it on he ground and threw it onto the roof.There is no zipper for closing. Roll it up like a potato chip bag and secure with a buckle. I'd feel better if they added a zipper to it.Went on the trip and everything held together. My husband was nervous it would all fly off the roof, but that did not happen.So . . . it works, but is very awkward to load."
2,Soft top carrier,Not real pleased with this. Bought it for my son for Christmas. The instructions were very vague and it looked terrible when we got it up on the car. It did not have near the storage I thought it would.
3,Not bad Mr. Cullen,This film was alright. I definitely would not watch it more than once but it was entertaining enough the first time. It starts off a little slow but picks up a bit later on. The quick camera shots bothered me. I can't pinpoint it but something was missing in this movie to make me love it. Thus earning its three stars. Peter Facinelli did a good job with the story as well as the acting. It was fun to see him in a different role instead of just the fatherly vampire. So I would say watch it if you are bored.
3,Loosies,"I just watched this movie its alright. The storyline was weak if they added more to the movie I felt that it would of made a difference. I would watch it again, it was the first time I watched it."
3,Hit or miss,"First, off what this album lacks is a good rythm section. There's no real drumming or bass in this album. A lot of it is Neil's noodling guitar accompanied with an organ. The drumming that goes along with this is really faint or minnimalistic. So what you end up with is a bunch of hooks, or solos without the backbone structure. Minus this complaint I think there's some good stuff on here. I'm just left to think that they really dropped the ball with the drums thing."
3,Diego Doodle,"I purchsed this for my grandson who Loves Go Diego Go. What I like about it is that it's durable...my grandson has a habit of standing on it and it has held up beautifully. However, after using it many times, I find that the screen begins to darken & I cannot get it totally clean. That said, my grandson loves to hear the comments from diego and I am happy it has the wonderful ""off"" button."
1,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"My opinion, this book is worthless. Author rushes over details of how-to but pontificates at length about philosophical issues. I got half-way through and gave up. This is NOT a practical guide for small businesses. Save your money (or buy the used book I'm putting up for sale)!"
4,Should be on every new business shelf,"This book has must read chapters on how to be a successful entrepreneur. The chapters are well laid out, easy to read and understand. I don't know what edition this was, but it seems to me that one should be released on laptop business. Nice manual for anyone starting out on their own."
5,The Big Book of Life,"While I would love to write a review of how Tom's guidance has helped my business succeed (and it has!), the surprise beneift of his books is that they become a guide for your life, not just your business."
1,BUYER BEWARE - Misleading Ad,"This is a very misleading ad. It displays a 40 gal. Breeder Aquarium with Versa tops and is priced accordingly. The reviews of the product which also indicate that the items purchased are an aquarium and tops. Not so. The seller charged me $234 for two aquarium tops which, on the open market, cost about $40 apiece. I will be returning this product."
5,Very pleased,"This is one HEAVY top and I like it. I did not put the back piece on since the couple inch gap was no big deal for me. I have 2 turtles in this tank so only have the water level at about a third. Unlike my previous top, this one should still be fine when I'm dead and gone."
5,sweet license plate,this plate is sweet. it looks really good on the front of my truck and is exactly what it shows in the pic
1,JUNK!!!,I installed the plate on my truck it looked great got up the next morning the letters fell off of the tag.
2,Hooked on FFXI? Then go online for a guide!,This written guide cannot encompass the world of FFXI as well as online resources can. I would highly suggest you skip this version and look towards the BG Forums or even ffxiclopedia or wiki versions of guides out there. It merely passes as a glimpse into the huge world that is FFXI.
3,This Guide Used To Be Good,"With the new expansion coming out for this game on the XBOX 360, another updated strategy guide will be coming out soon. This book is excellent for quests and some missions, but it's also 2 years old. While all the quests are still there, websites such as allakhazam have more up-to-date information on quests and missions than this book would. I recommend you the reader to either wait for a newer release of this book, or just use an online reference site."
1,Zero is more like it!,"Nothing makes me madder than when I'm playing and somone references this POS. For example, most recently while doing the summoners quest, a friend told me that according to ""the Guide"" that we shouldn't leave Sarabataru otherwise we wouldn't experience all the weather. This guide is the reason we have so many warrior/white mages running around thinking that they are training to be paladins, when in reality they are getting much less party invites, and severely gimping the parties they do get in. ""The Guide"" recomends taking a Chocobo on your first trip to Jeuno; go figure that one out and then tell me this is still a good guide."
2,Waste of money,"These guides are very thorough but there's nothing in them that you can't find on-line and with all the patches for this game, they become quickly outdated. Save your money and don't buy."
4,Useful guide for a fun game,"While this guide isn't a complete walkthrough, it does have a lot of valuable information for all players. Granted it stops giviing mission info past level 5, and doesn't really appeal to the higher level people, but does it really need to? The whole point of any Final Fantasy is exploring and finding things out on your own. This guide shines most with the craft skills such as cooking, goldsmithing, clothcraft and so on. If you want to know a food effect, this guide will tell you. It will also help you if you're just starting out. Most of the race/job recommendations make sense, and you'll have some help with your first few quests and missions. This wasn't meant to be a hand-holder through this game. Just a tool to help you out with some of the more confusing points, as well as getting new players started on the right foot. I recommend this guide to anyone who plays this game."
2,No usefull at all,"I bought this book expecting to have some biger knowledge on VB topics. Is just for beginners, any information here you can find it better from microsoft site.Waste of 59.00"
1,Not useful at all...,"I bought this book in a local shop, hoping it would describe some advanced aspects of VB programming. What a dissapointment! There's absolutely nothing good to say about this book - avoid it!"
3,"Misleading title, good info for beginners wanting more","What you see on the cover and what you get inside are different. This book contains no ""insider secrets"", instead what you have here is the information that sets the beginner apart from the intermediate VB programmer.I give it three stars for content, because it does cover a lot of intermediate-advanced level topics, but it only skims the surface of the advanced level stuff (Win32 API calls, using of the Registry).There are no professional ""secrets"" found anywhere in this book, in fact about 1/4 of the book is aimed competely at the beginner, most of the remaining text helps the beginner become and intermediate level VB programmer.Go flip though it before you buy."
1,Most of the so-called 'secrets' are beginners stuff.,"As an experienced VB programmer I bought this book hoping to pick up the odd advanced hint or tip. I was very disappointed. I learnt nothing new. The book is meant to be aimed at intermediate to advanced developers, but I doubt even junior programmers would learn anything useful."
2,"For ""Beginning to Intermediate"" Reader Level","This book is shallow,incomprehensive -- is not as suggested as for ""Reader Level: Intermediate to Advanced""."
1,cusinart chrome can opener,"The picture and discription is not the can opener that I recieved. This can opener is not the same shape plastic and not chrome . It is painted grey and cheep. I could have purchased this can opener in any retail store less than what I paid. VERY DISAPPONINTED. The picture should be the same item that was up for sale.

5,How to use Towel Warmers properly,"Just a quick note to let new prospect buyers know that the towels should not be weaved in /out of the rails. The proper way to use the Vauxhall and other Warmrails products is by folding your towel lengthwise (or in fourths, depending on the size of your towel) and then draping it over the rail (and then doing the same thing on the second and third bar). You then should take another towel and lay it over the towel on the top rail. This will act as an insulator and help trap the heat in the fibers of the towels keeping the towel nice and warm."
2,"Dries ONE towel, hardley warms it though","I used to live in a house that had a Runtal towel warmer. This unit really dried multiple towels AND warmed them all the way through. With this unit, which I own, I find the towel does dry after a few hours... (The only reasonen it gets two stars instead of one) BUT the towel is NOT thoroughly warmed and cools almost instantly when removed from the ""warmer"" My advise would be to get towel warmer that works at a much higher temperature OR at least give you the option. This warmer has ONE setting on or off."
5,Great measuring tape holder.,"I use to work in surroundings where you constantly have to climb and most of the time you must wear a tool belt. I use to use the tool belt tape holder provided on it, however, it doesn't securing holder your tape. I got tired of bumping into objects resulting the tape measure sliding off my tool belt clip and almost hitting someone. With this you don't have to worry about that anymore. This holder allows you to fit small 16', 25', or even 30' tape measures. All will fit and the top button strap will secure the measure in place. Unlike leather tape measure holders, this holder seems much easier to remove your tape when you need it. I strongly recommend it to any person who climbs often with their tool belt."
5,Visual Awesomeness,Geoff McFetridge is extremely talented. His work is pretty inspirational from a graphic design standpoint. Defintaly worth checking out.
3,History in simple fashion.,"Well, I've been involved with aerohistory for quite a while so I'm a bit beyond the level of this book. It's a good, basic, history of US Naval Aviation from 1941 to 1991. Nothing wrong with the book. It's just too simple for me. Some of the picture captions are a bit fishy, though. Watch yourself. The F3H Demon, for example, was hamstrung by a poor engine. The caption here seems misleading suggesting some other problem. Interesting pictures, however. A book I'm glad I bought second hand. Don't think I'd care to pay full price for it."
4,Youth's quest for novelties,"Probably, to those, especially, first time in their lives watching with this movie depicted Bhutan, both landscapes and locals, this film is an educative, broadening a general knowledge work reflecting filmmaker's uncertainty of whether he became better in the USA while still preferring writing the books and movie-scripts in America rather than in a native village.Lovely Himalayan landscapes and funny scenes of contemporary Bhutanese customs very much sustain a very general story of generational change and youth's quest for novelties."
1,No inspiration,"This is a very poor movie. Its a standard American movie set in a Bhutan, nothing new here. I was hoping for inspiration to visit Bhutan but all the scenic shots are just postcard shots, it could have been shot in the Canadian Rockies for all I know. I thought the King of Bhutan wanted to keep the commercial world away but from watching this movie Bhutan is not a Shangri-La anymore! Don't waste your time watching this movie like I did!"
5,Travellers and Magicians,"Film-maker Khyentse Norbu (also a revered Buddhist lama) has fashioned a gentle, lyrical film that's also wise and thought-provoking, if you can take your eyes off the lush, dazzling Bhutan scenery. Though Dondup's comical adventure stands on its own (particularly his uneasy interactions with the monk), the movie's astounding visual beauty elevates it to a whole new level. Eye-candy for the soul."
3,There's no place like home,"This is a beautiful film which also serves as a travelogue for Bhutan. The story is sweet with darker overtones that make it an adult fable with a moral as old as ""The Wizard of Oz."" A restless young Bhutanese man wants to go to America. He travels in ways he doesn't expect, and his fellow travellers give him insights into his own heart. The film feels a lot like Spanish magical realism, yet told from a Buddhist perspective. The story unfolds at a rather stately pace, so the viewer needs to relax into it and just enjoy this brief trip to Bhutan."
5,Very heart felt and informative tale of life in Bhutan,One of the view movies I've about that has been made in and are about Bhutan--A must see for any one interested in Buddhism or Bhutan.
4,A great lesson,"The archetypal tale of finding contentment in ones own backyard is portrayed in this delightful film about a wandering local government official in Bhutan. While ""on the road"" the official and his co-travelers,(monk, fair maiden, fruit seller) reflect on the lessons of the monks stories about suffering and clinging to false concepts of stability. The pace of this film is most likely slow for American audiences but the pace is integral to highlighting the conflicts within the government officials desire to find nirvana in materialism."
2,Eh. What do monks know about flirting?,"While this story has merits it is not anything like the Cup in terms of style or presentation- in fact it looks like it was quickly shot on video. Perhaps this would have been a nice short film, but the fact that a young man desires a hottie at the bus stand in the moment he is leaving does not make a full movie. I will tell the truth because to lie aboout a Lama or Monk is worse than to lie about anyhing. Better luck next time- and leave the liscensciousness and desire to us sinners. The Cup was so good because the director knew his terrain, this movie is lost and a tiresome wandering, and the kind words pandering. Still, it is serene and the locations are nice hills and mountains."
1,iT plays havoic with Spider-Man continunity,"These are all supposed to be stories that take place at various points in Spidey's career as a hero, but it's all so much to place within the context of the comic. Spidey's past adventures were very well written from Stan Lee and Steve Didko to more recent writers like David Michelinie, and to say that these stories take place between this issue of the comic or that issue, is too difficult to keep track of all of it. Maybe they can get away with this with the X-Men, but not Spider-Man. No more untold tales from the past, let's focus on the present."
3,some content too mature,"I bought this video for my 3.5 year old who is tri-lingual. I wanted him to have the exposure to Spanish through stories that are culturally relevant to Spanish-speaking people. Some of the content is too mature for my 3.5 year old and I would argue would be too mature for 6-year olds as well. Some of the stories are focused too heavily on boy-girl relationships, attracting the opposite sex, etc."
3,Maya & Miguel,I recommend you know if the film is in English or in Spanish. I wanted in Spanish for my bilingual grand son but I got it in English;-(
3,Will reinforce your views,"If you believed Menachem Begin was a semi-lunatic living in a dream world where ethnic violence was cool, this book will reinforce that. If you believed that Begin was a hero with a vision, this book will reinforce that."
2,Disappointing,"I love historical fiction and was thrilled to find the first 3 books in the library. I know why now. While I really enjoyed Baxter and Sabina's stories, there was little character and plot development to really endear the reader to the series. What is most frustrating is that in the next two books you will hear nothing about Baxter or Sabina as if they fell off the face of the earth...even though this is a small community where everyone knows everyone....and by the way, Dianna, I do not know everyone so stop throwing names out there in each book to which I have no clue who they are and spend 20-30 minutes reviewing to discover if I missed something. If interested in historical fiction stick with Lauraine Snelling or Gilbert Morris."
3,The Royal Festival Hall disappoints,"Virgil does his best but the accoustics and the Harrison & Harrison organ do not compare with the Aeolian Skinner organ of Riverside Church. Janet Coster and the John McCarthy Chorus brighten the CD and the chimes of the organ add a little but the accoustics of The Royal Festival Hall in my opinion spoil listening pleasure.'A Virgil Fox Christmas' on EMI CDM 7243 5 66088 is a much better recording, includes most of the same pieces and the accoustics of Riverside Church compliment a better organ."
3,A blessing to Bible students everywhere,I began to use Dr. Bullingers work about twenty years ago and as I have grown in my understanding of the Bible so has my appreciation of his work
5,Simply the most insightful and best study bible you can purchase,"I have studied Hebrew and Greek for over 20 years. I have now realized that the insight to GOD's WORD is living out GOD's WORD in you heart. This is the Bible that taught me that. E.W.Bullinger takes his knowledge of Hebrew and Greek and then unfolds the universe with his faith. Please check out his other books on the Witness of the Stars and Numbers in Scripture. He is simply unsurpassed though a hundred years have physically separated us from him.Kyle Jones, Hendersonville, Tennessee"
5,Companiion Bible,This is one of the most useful editions of the bible that any person can have for the understand of GOD'S word
3,mixed review,"Book was delivered promptly. I bought new and condition appeared wonderful. I found the appendices useful and interesting. Very happy and pleased. So far a 5 star appearance, however, When I was referencing some scripture I found that page 1519/1520 had a small tear, easy enough to fix with some clear tape. But page 1517/1580 was badly mangled/ ripped with text unrecoverable. Fortunately I have other bibles and will only miss the text and notes from John 2:4 to John 3:1 and John 3:10,11,19. While it would have been nice to have a flawless product, the flaws are not enough to cause me to never purchase from the provider again. I will think twice about buying a new book from this provider, especially if a used product is available. I've never been disappointed with those."
3,Companion Bible,"I have only started to study using this version. The Bible has a plain cover, not very attractive. The binding appears to be quality. The printing is accurate, at least as far as I have studied. (I have only studied two books) The reference printing is quite small. If someone has seeing issues they would be better not to get this printing.Bruce"
5,Compian Bible-Bur-H,I would encourage any serious student of Gods word to invest in this Bible with all the much needed additional Hebrew teaching.
5,Love this Companion Bible,"Companion Bible: King James Version, Burgandy, Indexedis great for someone who wants to learn more about the Bible which is more important than ever in this day and age. Just look at the freaky weather which was foretold in the Bible!!I need to learn more what the Bible means. I read it but it makes no sense to me, so I hope the Companion Bible will help me.I heard alot of reputable preachers/pastors on TV refer to the Companion Bible.I am impressed by the indentation on each book of the Bible. It only adds to the quality of this purchase."
5,My Companion Bible,"This is the Bible to have. It really meets you right where you need to, so you can understand the word of God."
5,My Textbook For Healthier Living!,"I really like my Companion Bible, it helps understand God's letter to me chapter-by-chapter, verse-by-verse.I've gotten a lot of use from these pages and sincerely hope to get double of what I've put in, too.I know that I will always be a sinner, never too good though to seek someone who was perfect beyond blemish."
2,Unhappy,"Dear People,I ordered the Companion Bible because my Brother in Jesus has on he ordered years ago. At that time the Bible came in Large Print, this one isn't. That has the Strong numbers, this one doesn't. This one has about 1/6 the Hebrew and History as the old one. I feel ripped off by a Bible company, that's a bad feeling. It's not Amazons fault, it's the publisher of the Bible.Sincerely,Randy Berry"
4,WARNING! THIS IS NOT A BEGINNER'S BIBLE!,"The Companion Bible is quite possibly one of the best study Bibles on the market. However, the marginal notes and the 198 appendices by E.W. Bullinger contain a tremendous amount of complex and controversial material that may be overwhelming to the beginning Bible student and for those who are babes in Christ. Those interested in purchasing this Bible should have a Strong's Exhaustive Concordance on hand and do some research on E. W. Bullinger. Most of all, pray for God's guidance. In addition, the print in this edition is VERY SMALL. This is especially true of the marginal notes and the 198 appendices. I suggest that you get the LARGE PRINT edition."
5,Understand the Introduction!,"The COMPANION BIBLE is the finest study Bible you will find. It is virtually free of ""opinions"". Rather, the marginal notes, structural breakdown and subject/object clarity brings the Word alive with new meaning. Read and re-read the Introduction so you understand how to use the COMPANION BIBLE to it's fullest extent. Bullinger was the only person C.D. Ginsberg allowed to review the Massoretic footnotes. A word of wisdom is sufficient. Buy the Genuine leather edition with thumb index for lasting study in the Word of God."
4,The Good Book,I had no idea all the information I was missing. This is very well organized and easy to use. I would suggest this for anyone who is looking to study God's word and gain a better understanding of it.
3,Small Print,"This Bible contains so much material, great information, more than you can absorb many times.It is a great value at less that $40 for the Hardcover. I wanted leather which was much more expensive, but thought better of spending the extra for it as I now wear glasses for reading, and this Bible is so hard to read, even with my glasses. The only large print editions at priced at $82 and $100.00. I am quite sad about buying this Bible. I have most every edition of the Bible printed but not the Companion Bible and now I have it but cannot make use of it. I will try a page magnifier and hope it helps."
5,"All as listed, very pleased.","Everything was as described, the book, the mailing time, the price, etc. I was overall very pleased with my shopping experience with Amazon and will shop again when I shop for products that Amazon may supply."
1,This Bible has numerous printing mistakes,"This is a good study Bible but the print is small and there are numerous printing errors, like a short sentence will have no spaces between the words, or the last two letters of a word may be missing and attached to the first of the next word, it's crazy. I should have returned this Bible but I thought It was in one or two places but it's all over this Bible. Kregel Publications are the printers of this bible and they must have no quality control at all. It's sort of a shame in a way because other then the printing problems this seems to be a quality Bible."
2,"thin pages, hard to read","Pages are cheap photocopies on thin, transparent onion skin, hard to read at first, but you can get used to it. Its the only Companion Bible I could find, so its better than nothing. Still, for $40 I expected more. I previously bought a really nice, new, large-print KJV, with gold leafed titles, gold edges, and leather binding, for $39 from a local shop, and they put my mom's name on it for free; so that was either a really good deal, or this was sort of a rip-off."
1,"Encourages Heresy, and racism.","This Is Appendix 26 From The Companion Bible.""This shows that Genesis 6:9 does not speak of Noah's moral perfection, but tells us that he and his family alone had preserved their pedigree and kept it pure, in spite of the prevailing corruption brought about by the fallen angels.""This is but one twisting of the words of the Bible, found in Mr. Bullingers Companion Bible, which is a favorite of the ""Christian Identity Movement""; who beleive in racial separation.If one want to know the truth, one needs to aquire a Bible, without Bullingers notes."
5,Companion BIble---large print,"This is my third copy of this excellent research Bible and I wouldn't trade it for any other Bible I've ever owned. The researched information it contains is the best I've found anywhere. There are a couple of notations that point to Bollinger's personal church doctrine, but the bulk of the information he has provided is excellent.Several reviews say that this Bible is ""not for beginners"". I emphatically disagree. It is essential to learn from the beginning the truth presented in the Word of God and not the doctrines of men. Having to un-learn is far more difficult than learning the truth from the beginning!"
5,the Companion Bible enlarged print a pleasant experience,"I was not prepared for how large and heavy it was. I found that I was very happy being able to read the print without straining my eyes.The paper and print was very satisfactory as well as the binding and cover. Due to one of the negative reviews I had read about the ink smearing over the paper, I was a little hesitant. I am happy to encourage those who have aging eyes and a love for the Word of God wanting an in depth study Bible, this is a sure buy."
3,Bible Study,"The Bible looked to be a good bible for the younger christian with good eye sight. Dont buy this bible if you need readers, the print is to small. I would buy this bible in large print but it does not come leather bound"
1,The names just bothered me,"Even though the author had an explanation for the spelling of his characters' chinese names, I (as an Chinese American) found this book a really hard read while Mr. Coonts uses Vitnamese, Taiwanese, and Korean (?) names for his Chinese characters, and randomly exchanges Cantonese and main-land Chinese names. For example, one Chinese person was named Ng. In all, I think it is apparent that the author had little knowledge of the contemporary Hong Kong and China.Unlike other reviewers, I was not bothered by the robots. I thought it was good imagination, and most likely the weapon of future combat."
4,Better but not his best,"I truly enjoyed this book. After the first 100 or so pages I couldn't put it down. Much better than the prior novel (Cuba). I found the principal characters generally believable. The robots seemed a bit much at first, but then anything is possible. Perhaps something similar does exist for the military. Looking forward to the next story."
4,Jake Grafton Makes Smooth Transition Ashore,"Stephen Coonts proves he is more than equal to the task of maintaining the Jake Grafton character as he ages and moves away from the cockpit and the flight deck. This story harkens back to the tone and the pace that Coonts set with Under Siege, another book that found Jake Grafton ashore. Coonts works in some old characters, an exotic locale and some pretty good observations on the looming political/cultural struggles in China. He also weaves in some good comparisons to present day Hong Kong and life the way it was under British rule. There is enough high-tech stuff here to satisfy the techno-thriller reader, but it is paralleled by some good character portraits and an expansion of the character of Jake's wife, Callie. All in all a very satisfiable addition to the Jake Grafton series."
3,Fortune cookies and revolution,"David Poyer, Tom Clancy and Stephen Coonts have made China this season's enemy du jour. This entry involves the least amount of military might, but does utilize a sci-fi robot to carry the day for the revolution that occurs, when big business can't take communism any more. Grafton's task this time is more personal, the rescue of his wife from a gangster. But it somehow seems too easy, though you won't find it hard to keep turning the pages."
2,Coonts Weakest Novel - Exciting but Flawed,"This book drew my attention because it combined my interest in Asia (including China) with the excitement that I knew from other Stephen Coonts novels featuring Jake Crafton. The book is exciting but it lacks depth. Many have noticed the factual errors but it should certainly not be read as a realistic account of China. There are some truths in the book but over all it misses the actual situation. A revolution as presented in this book is no longer realistic, if it ever was. But taken as a fictional novel, it attempts to cross the border between the realistic and the fantastic. However, this is not Coonts type of novel and thus he is unable to leave his realistic style. Thus the book remains uneven and is not worth the money. Buy another book from Stephen Coonts instead! He knows how to make a story exciting without making you feel uneasy as in this book."
3,Good Entertainment,"It was a good, enjoyable book. The dialog was a bit too polished for real Hong Kong. The circumstances are a true stretch from reality. But the book was a entertaining weekend distraction."
1,Save your Hong Kong Dollars,"Yuck. For a better story, better writing, better research, better everything about Hong Kong and espionage, read The Honourable Schoolboy by John LeCarre. Coonts should stick to writing about warfighting."
5,Pox on commie apologists,"Look at the mewling the communist apologists engage in here! The one sentence that sums up exactly why all this vitriole is spewed at Coonts is the very last one... ""Any complaints should be addressed to the Pinyin troglodyte in Peking, or Beijing, or whatever.""This book is a no holds barred look at the amazingly corrupt communist regiem that now ownes Hong Kong. It is fast paced, and a great read. If you hate communist China, this book will put a smile on your face."
5,"A nice Interesting, eventful, and exciting book!","This was actually my first Stephen Coonts novel I have read, and I loved it. There were so many changes in what was going on, and so many interesting characters to follow. I really liked the story line in this book, and I would reccommend it to anyone."
2,Robots and mechanical flying bats???,"This was my first Grafton novel (and my first Coonts novel for that matter) so maybe I am not versed in this author style of storytelling. Everything was going great until I got to the part about the fighting robots and mechanical flying bats. It just seemed like the easy way out to give the upperhand to the rebels. Furthermore, the ending sucked.The reason I bought the book was because the premise intrigued me: a Chinese revolution started in Hong Kong by conspiring Americans and Chinese dissidents. This topic should be taken up by another author of this genre, but this time make it believable (i.e. leaving the robots out)."
2,Robots are too much.,"This book started out fairly well, but then those darn York robots started showing up. I was looking for a novel that included some spying and flying - instead I got science fiction and an old admiral who handles himself like a 30 year old CIA-trained killer.I normally love this guy's books, but this one was a disappointment."
2,Worst tech support I have ever experienced,"My Tv started to have sound problems and I sent off an email to Olevia. No response. Then tried calling support - had to leave a message.Days later after no response I called and transferred to sales - helpful guy and wanted all the details but again he could not help and would have tech support call me back - NO LUCK with call back3 weeks go by and now I am getting rather ticked at the no response. So rewrote email again - no response.Called tech support and left my number - no response.Again called sales and got another person.Got a live body - Yaaahoo! - could not help but forwarded me to customer service (to give me the service at home number). Customer service could not help and said Tech support were the ones to talk to. After an hour plus on hold I get to talk to a tech. 1/2 hour later he came to the conclusion that I needed service.The support issue is really bad. My recomendation is call them yourself before you buy the TV.Oh, and Good Luck!!!!"
4,Good deal,"Excellent product for the price. The image is very good, the sound is ok and satisfy all my needs.I recommend it if you want a good LCD but don't want to spend a lot of money on Sony's..."
5,Submitting to Christ's Plan Is Not Easy,"Christianity in the USA has gone far away from the Biblical truth. Whereas the Bible explicitly calls, Jews, ""Children of the Devil"" in the Gospel of John (Jesus Himself!), we in America call Jesus Christ, our God and Savior a Jew. Can you imagine how insulted our God in Heaven must be at such a blasphemy against His Son, God the Son, the Second Person in the Holy Trinity? But this shows how far America has gone away from the teaching of Jesus Christ as found in the Gospels. This book is great because it helps you to think about what we have lost -- that very first love for Jesus Christ. We have lost it as individuals; we have lost it as a nation."
4,You Can Feel the Heat and Sorrow Between the Covers,"Mr. Hatch has written a taunt true story of grim reality. Like the Titanic, The Hidenberg, The Coconut Grove and other assorted and avoidable human disasters, the reader knows the ending before opening the book. But like all good reporters - and Mr. Hatch is first, last and always a well seasoned newsman - it is how he stacks the facts that counts. In Tinder Box it is not 'what' happens, as much as 'how' and 'why,' and finally, sadly, who pays the price. In today's era of litigation, much is made of the lawyer-sharks; but before their arrival, the victims of these man-made tragedies were like guppies swimming with piranhas. Only the victims paid. Mr. Hatch is never brutal, but neither does he turn aside from the grim facets of those ghastly events of that day in in late 1903,when 600 victims, many of them women and children, burned to death in an ""absolutely fireproof"" building. It is a great read, fast paced and gripping."
1,Stereotypical porn,"So, Alyson books says they break down stereotypes of gay athletes with their ""true stories"" of jocks and track coaches, then pays the rent with cheesy porn about sex-addicted homos turning locker rooms into bath houses.This kind of writing only furthers the biases against us in the sports world. Like their other porn books, Alyson thinks they can have it both ways. How pathetic. The writing is okay, no better than the stuff in any porn mag, but the idea behind this is deluded and misguided.I got a free copy of this book, and it was worth every cent."
2,beware flimsy,"I have owned many Victorinox knives and ordered as a gift for my daughter assuming it would be a solid tool. It is an expensive little gimmick and seems flimsy compared to their other knives. I was surprised how small it is and should have read the product description more carefully. The slender little blade can hardly be called a knife. I suppose this would be fine as a key chain weight but don't be fooled into thinking it is a real tool. I will instead order the ""Compact"" or ""Huntsman plus"" model which have larger blades and larger pens."
4,Great games,I like almost all the games. The bonus challenges are fun and worth the price just for them.
2,I Burned my Copy,"Stated off bearable and made it to the latter stages of the book before I thought about burning it. Once they go to India following the mysterious 'cult', it becomes a load of tripe. Unoriginal, uninteesting, and uninspired. And, what happened to the SCIENCE? I remember when Dcotor Who was SCIENCE FICTION. Now, they have characters muttering magic words to make things happen! Give me a break, I like SCIENCE in my SCIENCE FICTION. Also, it is a disgrace what they have done to a fine character like Ace in the NAs. Some really bad lines in here as well. I also wonder why the NA authors find it necessary to put silly references to modern culture in these books by mentioning Sonic the Hedgehog and Blue Peter to name a couple. Tripe."
4,It Was a Wonderful Life,I like Jodie Foster and I happened to find this movie. It turned out to be so good. This movie is a documentary about hidden homeless women. Those could be any one of us. I want to have the strength of holding myself tight enough that it won't affect by any changes around me.
1,This article is about BLACK HENNA,"This is not about real, natural henna. This article is about the deviants that add PPD to their henna to make it stain fast and be black. PPD is NOT safe for skin contact. But real, natural henna stains red/brown and has been used for centuries as body art."
5,Good for stretching,"These plugs look rather darker than in the photo above, both in and out of my ears, more brown than brownish-yellow. I don't know if it's a difference between batches or just the lighting for the photograph.I discovered glass jewellery a couple of months ago and decided to use these for a fresh stretch from 8ga to 6ga (since I'm a science student, to me ""g"" is ""grams"" not ""gauge""). I used an acrylic taper to stretch my earlobes and put these in by butting them up against the end of the taper. My ears were inflamed for the first few days, so the glass was good since the dried pus and serum a.k.a. ""crusties"" doesn't stick to it as much as to metal."
4,This rocks hard!,"This is a thoroughly entertaining solo CD (his second) from the ex-MSG and current B'z drummer. It goes without saying that Gaalaas has some brilliant drumming on this record, but I was also impressed with his heavy guitar riffing and vocal harmonies. It's like combining CSN vocals over the top of heavy metal, and it's very consistent so the whole album is a strong listen."
2,Mucinex is good product but the price is ridiculous,"I was coerced by marketplace tactics into buying this brand of guaifenesin, but I will not order it from Amazon. My local Target sells bottles of 40 tablets at a far better price-per-tablet. Amazon's price has increased by approximately 75% in the last couple of months. Be aware, buying in bulk is not always the least expensive choice!The reason I used the phrase ""coerced... into buying this brand!"" is that the pharmacist who was making an excellant product had to stop making it at a reasonable cost due to Mucinex's patent infringement threats. All Mucinex wanted to do was to corner the market on a medication many must have daily. To the best of my knowledge, Mucinex is currently owned by Rickett-Benkheiser."
3,Mucinex 600mg Extended Release Tabs,I hadn't tried Mucinex before buying on Amazon. It might just be me but all the Mucinex has done is dry me out everywhere except my nose! My throat and mouth were extremely dry to the point that it was uncomfortable. It got to the point where I could not take it anymore and discontinued usage. I might not have needed this product.. maybe a gentler decongestant. I would recommend for people that have severe congestion.. this would help incredibly!
1,Disappointment with product,"I ordered the product Guaifenesin thinking I was getting something to aid me with the pain I suffer from Fibromalgia. Instead what I received was a product called Mucinex, an expectorant, which is an aid to remove mucus from one's throat and lungs. I feel I was mislead and am not happy about the situation. Never was I told that the product Mucinex had Guaifenesin in it. I am terribly confused with the situation and do not know how to take the medication."
5,Great for my lungs & fibromyalgia!,"I have COPD and Fibromyalgia. Mucinex (guaifenison) keeps my lung mucous loose and also relieves my fibromyalgia pain. If you try it for the fibromyalgia benefits, do not take aspirin as I understand it blocks the action of guaifenison from helping block the pain."
5,Mucinex is THE MUST HAVE product for all sinus issues,"Mucinex Extended-Release Bi-Layer Tablets 100 Count.I have used Mucinex continually for many, many years due to chronic year round allergies and it has never failed to work. I highly recommend this product to everyone."
5,Mucinexa good deal,I have been looking for a large size bottleof Mucinex as i take it dialy in winter.I found it ata very reasonable price on Amazon.
5,"Mucinex Expectorant, Bi-Layer Tablets, 100-Count Bottle",The only product that can be bought over the counter that gives my husband some relief from his Bronchiectasis. The 100 count bottle lasts quite a bit longer and is a bit cheaper in the long run.
5,good product - good service,This is a product I've been using for many years since the days when a Prescription was required. It helps my chronic sinusitis.
4,Is the price for real?,"I just bought this product last night at Walgreens and paid 19.99 (on sale reg 25.99 ) for 28 tablets 1200 mg. The seller here has it listed as 600 mg but is the EXACT same product. Also they sell 100 tablets for 25.99, how can they be this cheap? Other sellers seem to be more inline with with what I paid and dosage. Just curious...PS...if you have a thing about taking very large pills you might want to buy the strips or liquid cough relief. These things are HUGE and I had to break into 4 pieces to take. Horse pills is what my dad would call them. lol"
2,Not as expected,"The product is a good product. HOWEVER, I thought I was buying a BOTTLE of 500, but instead received 5 boxes of 100 tablets in blister packs. I have arthritis, and punching out the pills is extremely painful. I will look for a different distributor."
1,"Good product, bad price","Amazon's price on this item has risen enormously over the past year. There are several places on line that sell it for significantly less, and even my local Wal-Mart is lower. I may be congested, but it hasn't affected my brain!"
1,TRYING TO GOUGE US!!!,"THIS PRODUCT IS BEING OFFERED AT A PRICE THAT IS $40-$80 MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE WEB. THEY MUST REALLY THINK WE ARE STUPID. THIS IS INSULTING TO PEOPLE WHO BUY AT THIS SITE DUE TO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF TRUST AND RELIABILITY THAT COMES WITH BUYING ON AMAZON. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE VENDORS LIKE THIS AROUND."
1,No Expiration Date!,Would never buy this product because they don't list an expiration date and there is no contact information for seller
4,Mucinex Extended-Release Tabs Blister Pack,"I wanted 500 Mucinex Extended-Release Tabs in a bottle. Instead I got 500 of them in many blister packs. That is pretty annoying. The picture was a bottle with 500 printed on it. But, that was not what I got."
1,"I was shipped the 100 tablets 20 to a card on 5 cards in a box instead of what I ordered, the BOTTLE of 100.",I paid extra for the bottle of 100 vs. the box of bubble cards you have to push the tablets through. I was very disappointed with what was sent.
2,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT,This product was nothing like what was described.The side effects were just as bad with upset stomachs and alot of cramps
5,My Doctor Recommended Mucinex,"My doctor recommended Mucinex to me to stop post-nasal drip. This is an excellent product. Sometimes the double strength tablets are needed (these are regular strength). When allergy season is in full swing or, if I have a cold, the stronger ones do the job.Using Mucinex allows me to stop incessant swallowing, alleviates the sore throat from the constant dripping, and makes me more comfortable.I use these so much that, I now order them at regular intervals through Amazon Prime. It saves me money for shipping and I don't have to go to the store to buy them."
5,Best price around,Mucinex can be very expensive. This is the very best price available anywhere.Fast delivery!
5,"Shipped quickly, fair price, mucinex works","Price is better than in local stores, shipped quicklyI have severe sinus allergies and mucinex is part of the treatment that helps prevent reacurring sinus congestion, headaches and infections.12 hour formula is more expensive but is easier than taking so many of the regular mucinex every 4 hours- unfortuantely there is no generic for the 12 hour tablets."
2,wrong size container sent,"My husband has arthritis and this causes difficulty in opening blister packs. I ordered a bottle of one hundred and was sent 3 blister packs of 40 each. The return process , however, was simple."
2,PRODUCT EXPIRES SOON!,"If you need to take this medicine right now, buy it and enjoy the price. If you want to use it later or if you buy it for someone else, be aware that the bottle expires soon! The one I just bought expires in 7/2011!!! I didn't see any description by this company about the expiration date. What a waste of money!"
3,need too be careful about expiration dates,some of the resellers of mucinex are unloading bottles with short time to expiration. my experience has been mixed and required some follow up
4,best price around for an excellent product,"My doctor prescribed Mucinex and it does the job perfectly well. I have been purchasing the product at retail prices and even on sale, or at COSTCO or BJ's, the price has always been higher than Amazon. I will be purchasing the larger size next time which will save me even more."
3,found a better deal,i went to the store to buy mucinex earlier how exspensive i found a store brand its the same as mucinex except cheaper $2.99 for 30 pills what a great deal
1,"ooops, not a bottle","The ad clearly says bottle. I purchased two because I have trouble opening the blister pack version, and I wanted bottles. They are blister packs. So much for solving that problem!"
5,excellent price,I use this product 2 x's a day and it does the job without drying me out too much. Just ordered more.
5,Life saver!! Am I am not kidding,"I have problems with so many of the infection fighting meds on the market. They cause bad side effects, and often do not do what they should. This last go around over $1000 in medications and each round made the problem WORSE.I took two of these tables and they stopped on an oncoming attack of bronchitis. But to my surprise they knocked out a sinuses infection that had been dragging on for two months.I could have save $1000 if I have these from the start.Amazing stuff."
5,Thanks Mucinex!,"This OTC medication is the only thing that has helped my Fibromyalgia besides sleep and good nutrition. I can start to tell a major difference after only missing a couple of doses. However, determining the correct dose to take did require some trial and error. This treatment should also only be done within the guidelines for the Protocol, otherwise, blocking will occur and you will be wasting both your time and money. I have tried numerous forms of guaifenesin, but the Mucinex is by far my favorite!"
2,Promises More Than Delivers,"I expected to have a good view of USA armor troops, but alas...too much fluff not enough depth. To me WW2 was not covered well and the Vietnam era not well enough. Maybe I was expecting much too much from 108 pages, and I reckon the color photos they tell you about are only the cover photos. I guess this book is like a M-4 Sherman--promised more than it delivered."
4,At last a look at Armerican armor crews,"The excellent GI series continues with a look at the uniforms and equipment used by US Army tank crewmen from the beginnings of tank warfare in WW1 to the modern day. This is the first time an author has focused on just the armored troops, and it was long overdue. Most of the book covers the WW2 period, which it does quite well. The weak point is that tank crews from the Korean War and Vietnam are covered only briefly, and there is weak coverage on the uniform variations seen in the 50's and 60's. The Gulf War gets better treatment. Text is minimal, consisting mostly of photo captions (which are well done). Photo selection and reproduction is excellent, except for some modern color photos (interestingly, the WW2 color is great!). Not the ultimate work on the US armored forces, but an essential reference for historians, collectors, and model-builders."
3,There are better singles...,"Although I'm a Duran Duran fan, I must admit that I just liked one remix of this maxi single. I also liked the remix for ""Out of My Mind"" and the B-side ""Sinner and Saint"". And, of course, the enhanced bonus video. If you are collecting Duran Duran, buy it. If not, you won't miss it."
4,Army pursues Apache with a hostage back to Arizona,"As with all of Gentry's books, the characters come alive. They are fictional characters in the middle of REAL HISTORY. In this book, it's an issue of honor or love for an Apache, mixed with trying to keep secrets to protect his friends, and trick the army and get back to the land he loves. Gentry's chrarcters are incredible, and I feel like I was there."
1,Weak and Often Lacking,"I found this book to be a complete wasteof money. New features are skimpy in the product, but this book doesn't take the time to address them in any reasonable way. The artwork is appalling as well."
1,Nothing New,"It is obvious in the first three chapters of this book that there is no original research here. It is simply a matter of going to the library and regurgitating what was already written in secondary sources. Other author's conjectures about the Revolutionary war spying story are simply repeated here, so accurately that one can tell which books they are taken from. It would be permissible to copy the historical fact, but when the old myths and conjecture of past researchers are repeated here as well, along with the fact, that is unacceptable."
5,excelente,"Hello good evening, excellent product quality, comfortable, nice, good wreck 100% recommend them very beautiful, I gusta.soy of Venezuela v"
4,A Useful Reference,"In the introduction, Luttwak states that 'The Dictionary of Modern War' is really more of an encyclopedia. This book is full of definitions and short discussions of thousands of military platforms and tactical/strategic concepts.For readers unfamiliar with the military this book will provide a wealth of information. A more knowledgeable reader will probably know the concepts and terms discussed(Airland Battle, Screening, etc.), but will still find this book useful for information about weapons platforms, which are discussed thoroughly, including many obscure/unusual weapons of war.This book is not without fault; its nomenclature is inconsistent, referring to weapons sometimes by number(M60, aka the Patton) and sometimes by name(Abrams, aka the M1). This book has a highly extensive section on nuclear weapons and terminology.Overall this is a good reference work, with valuable information for dilettantes and serious students of war alike."
5,El penultimo sueño,"I purchased this book after seeing an interview of Angela Becerra on t.v. The topic impressed me because the book she said took place between South America and Spain.My surprise was that from page one, she totally engrosses you with her characters that by the time you get to chapter 2, you feel as though you are part of the novel. The author has a beautiful way with words, and meshes her characters and situations in such a refined way, that you do not notice the transition.Her novel begins with a circle on page one and the whole story ends in a circle on the last page. Her descriptions are so real and the way her characters evolve is just wonderful.El Penultimo Sueño is one of my two most loved novels, the first being Don Quijote de la Mancha.I HIGHLY recommend this book and only hope that she write more books soon. It is a book that you hate to see the book is ending as you read.I am on the lookout for any future work by this author. It truly is a wonderful story!"
2,Soap opera,"I listened to this on audiobook. It was great Spanish practice. As far a literary value however, it was disappointing. It felt like a soap opera, with an implausibly large amount of highly implausible events happening to the characters without any motivation. In the last third of the book especially I found my self muttering ""Really?!??"" every few minutes. The ending touch was the worst - it was built up throughout the book, and maybe intended as a tip of the hat to the South American magic realists, but it just felt ridiculous."
3,"good start, weak end","I think it is an interesting love stoty with some nice elements and easy narration. However, the plot gets a little silly over time and the end is rather weak. It is entertaining if you don't have much expectations for the story line"
1,"Nice Looking, but Doesn't Hold Water","This was the best looking of the disposal/strainer combination flanges I could find. Was terribly disappointed that it didn't hold water well. Returned it for a Mountain Co. flange - doesn't look as nice, feels less substantial and is more expensive, but at least it holds water!"
4,Excellent starter book,"This is the first Blacksmith book that I have purchased, and I havne't been disapointed. In fact I am pleased that I bought the book every time I go back and open it up (which I do quite a bit). It's rich with detailed illustrations by the author, and full of historical information about the 19th century smith, some of which is presented in a story-like fashion.I have used this book for references, ideas for projects, and of course building a forge. The chapters on building a forge and a leather lung bellows is fantastic and better than most books on the subject. This is worth it, definately."
3,primarily for completists,"A few great duets with sparse or no accompaniment, a few interesting solo numbers, but a bunch of weak solo material as well. The singing is flawless, as always, sound quality is excellent, but not their best collection. My taste prefers their early harmonies."
2,Did not live up to its potential,"Although I normally find this an entertaining and fun series, this book was a disappointment. It was setting up to be a cozy ""locked-door"" mystery, when it suddenly took a turn in a different and inexplicable direction. I have to agree with the other reviewers that the constant references to C.J.'s intelligence were annoying, unnecessary, and distracting. The conclusion wasn't earth-shattering or even satisfying, but I won't give up on the series because of this one weak entry."
3,Entertaining,"Abby Timberlake returns from a cruise to find that the Den of Antiquity has been cleaned out by burglars. Her mother finds a bright spot, a supposed image of an angel on one of the very empty walls. Abby has no time for this nonsense, having been invited by a young hunk with a Jag on a sort of treasure hunt in the low counrty. CJ is invited along to help his brother. Alas, a slutty maid ends up dead and CJ confesses to the crime. Abby knows her looney friend couldn't kill anyone and sets out to prove it.This mystery provides the usual weird cast of characters, pluse a whole new bunch of crazies. Georgetown makes Charlotte seem sane. This mystery is alot of fun, I didn't even care who committed the crime."
5,Baroque & Desperate,"This was an excellent book by Tamar Myers. It's a cozy mystery, easy to read and enjoy. I loved it!"
5,Delicious History!,"When I saw this book, I had to have it. History & cooking!! What a unique idea! This creative book is chockfull of history and great recipes--what's NOT to like???"
4,Haunting - I will remember this one for a long time,"""Maddy's Song"" tells the story of Maddy Dow, a brilliant pianist, her family, and their life in the small town of Freedom, Maine. Occasionally, Dickson's grasp exceeds her reach - the continually shifting perspectives jarred a bit, and some of her symbolism was a little obvious, She does do a superb job of depicting thought processes: of the complacent, of the abused, of the abuser and of the collaborator, and somehow making them all human and sympathetic (or nearly so). Her descriptions of music and the thought processes of performers, are extraordinary. Uneven, but very good."
1,Great book,This book is free from the BLM....and against the law to sell. That being said it is a good book with techniques on how to monitor (and measure) plant populations.
4,"White Melamine Gourmac Pasta Spoon 12.75""","Sturdy spoon. Purchased to replace one I had from a few years ago (different brand). Although the head of the spoon is slightly smaller than my other brand, it is a sturdy pasta spoon that will serve its purpose without bending or breaking. I'm pleased."
5,I LOVE THIS PASTA FORK.,THIS IS A 5 STAR ITEM. UNFORTUNATLY ONLY A FEW ARE LEFT. MY HUSBAND BROKE MY LAST ONE I HAD FOR MANY YEARS THAT I GOT AT DANSK. THIS ONE IS EXACTLY THE SAME. MUCH BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER ONES OUT THERE.
2,Interesting read-- but no PR's for me,"As an experienced road-racer for a decade, and user of a heart monitor for several years, I looked forward to learning to use it more effectively. Author of the classic, ""Once a Runner,"" Parker promises marked improvement and PR's, backed up by enthusiastic testimonials. I eagerly followed his 12 week training plan to the letter, achieving 45-55 mile training weeks without injury or fatigue and increasing my cardiovascular fitness with a drop in resting heart rate to 45. Unfortunately, my 5K race pace slowed considerably as a result. All the easy running in the program made the hard training days feel much harder and converted me into a slower runner. This form of training just may not be suitable for every ""compleat"" idiot runner!"
3,"Triathlete's give it a miss, Runners should buy it","The books principle is to use the heart rate monitor to not train too hard on easy days and to go hard on hard days. This works well for runners who find it hard to do easy runs, triathlete's do this automatically by cross training. The triathlon chapter is there to sell a few more books. The stuff on calculating heart rate zones is good."
3,Runners Choice,"I agree with another review here that this book provides little specific information for the triathlete. There is only one chapter on multisport, and it doesn't provide any additional information to anyone who has done any reading on multisport training. From a training standpoint, this is just a book for runners.With that in mind, however, this book is an interesting read and very informative, without too much technical information, on the basic physiology at work. I feel it can even be useful to the multisport athlete despite the shortcomings discussed above. It's only going to help your running, however, and you are going to have to experiment yourself to figure out how to incorporate the heart rate into your running training because the basic training philosophy espoused calls for 5-6 running days per week which will be too much for most triathletes."
2,For serious runners only,This book is for the serious runners. The long distance runner may benifit from this but I was looking for weight loss help. I found other books to meet this need.
5,Good if you are patient.,"This book describes a system where you can use a heart rate monitor as an objective measure of exertion to improve your running by doing alternating high intensity and low intensity training days. It is clearly written with real life examples and walks you through the calculations.I have been doing the program a couple months now-- progress is slow, but by doing long runs at recovery pace (low intensity) I have been able to up my weekly mileage beyond what I had been doing without getting injured or burnt out. Not much improvement in speed yet (but is has gotten hotter and hotter outside as I've been doing the hard day / easy day heart rate training)."
5,Excellent book,"This book is an extremely easy to understand and use book for pulse monitor training. It was even fun to read. It is very concise and practical..I have implemented the program and enjoy it. I found another book on pulse training and found it extremely wordy, complex, with no clear direction for a training program at the end."
5,Great usable information,"This book has some great practical information that one can begin using immediately. For me, training according to my heart rate has proved to be a smarter way. My increase in performance has been measurable."
2,Easy to read but exercises too hard,"I had been running for years and had also done a few marathons when I decided to use a heart monitor. As I saw lots of 5 stars for the book I decided to buy it. In my opinion it asks too much of the runner. I reached a point where I dreaded to run on certain days because of the book. My rest heart rate was 51 and my maximum heart rate was 199. Even at novice level I had to run at 85% several times for 400 yards or 800 yards. I think it is a must to use a heart rate monitor but don't use the programs the author suggests. For German readers I suggest Ole Petersen's books ""Ironman"" or ""Marathon""."
4,Well thought out book,"I found this book useful as I ventured into the world of heart monitor training for the purpose of running marathons. Relatively simple to follow (for someone well-conditioned, I can't see some people getting their max heart rate with the way Parker does it, for example). Be aware that this is an evolving area of sports medicine and this is just one perspective.Worth buying."
2,"Cute, but daughter did not like it.","I think it is cute, but for some reason, my daughter did not pay much attention to it. I think that very small books like this, do not work well for children under 3-4 yo. I would not recommend it."
2,Lost my soles,"Purchased these boots from a well-known hiking product store (has 3 initials, starts with an R).Was absolutely thrilled with the fit, the springiness, the hardiness of these boots. Wore them right out of the box without any problems. No complaints.I live way out in middle of low desert (16 miles in on a dirt road. And, although i don't hike dailyi do spend a lot of time outside--gardening, walking dogs, horse-back riding (i really don't recommend these for that), and modifying the desert surrounding my house.Three years after purchase the soles on the Asolos both separated from the boot--i mean at the same time. Was i ever upset! The uppers are in great condition!Prior to purchasing the Asolo's i bought a pair of Merrell's Avian. The exact thing happened to them. I paid $60 the Merrells but $200+ for the Asolos. Use on both was about the same and they both lasted about the same amount of time.Is is just me or are boots not being made the way they used to?"
2,I'm A Fan,"If you're a fan, buy it, half the songs are pretty good if not misguided attempts at swamp rock. Original version of the now legendary bluegrass cover Freeborn Man. A couple of other tracks (Here Comes the Pain) would have fit nicely on the Revolution album."
1,Lacking in Content,"As the last reviewer indicated, this book does indeed have a catchy title. What lies within thought is not anything quite as catchy. Most tips are briefly touched upon without going into more in depth detail. The book seems to be written for single women and even goes as far as to give tips on obtaining and keeping men. Which is out of the subject title boundaries. If the tips were good, I might have been ok with that. The tips were poor, one example being don't have too neat of an apartment because men don't like that. Better advice - just be yourself rather that worrying whether your apartment is too neat. Most men, from my experience, really don't care."
1,Not Pleased,"If I could I would have given this book no stars. The title is the best thing about this book. The comparisons between ""City Girls"" vs ""Country Girl"" really irritated me. She also wrote how just walking down the street in the big city you spend all your money. The section on decoration your home and your guy why should you decorate your place just to please someone else. If you like ""flowers"" I think you should add them.I'm glad I saved my money and checked this book out from the library before I bought it."
1,"superficial, biased, not well researched","This book is superficial, biased (full of unsubstantiated generalizations about people), and not very well researched. As a journalism grad, I was disappointed that I bought this and kinda embarrassed for the author, who comes off as superficial, naive, and very provincial. The silly and erroneous generalizations about city vs. country could only come from someone provincial who's never been around. Funny how many NY people fall into that category."
2,Trendy and not well rounded,"I was hoping for a book that was a fun read and also informative. It has been several years since this book was published. The financial information could come from any other book or even online. The shopping tips are too east or west coast oriented, other cities in the middle of the country are left out. In short, sadly this book feels out dated and in need of revision."
4,"First published in 1940, when the US was on the brink of getting into the escalating war in europe,","Intellectual thinker of his day, LawrenceDennis, who was half ethnically black andraised by a wealthy black family in thesouth, it hilights his intuitive and talen-ted philosophical outlook, which was basical-ly the populist-far-middle. Highly recommended."
5,much better than the rented ones,I used it today for the first time. They are quite comfortable.I have just learned how to skate. These skates fit my feet well and I can keep balance much easier with them than using the rented ones.
2,Ice Skates American,"After my daughter had worn these skates only four times, they started to come apart. I ended up buying another pair for her to use.They did however arrive many days before I was told they would."
3,How does sizing work?,"Can anyone help with size determination? I don't know what size to buy. Should I go up down my regular shoe size or is there another method. I woul like a second opinion, a source with a chart would work best. Thanks!!!"
5,Great Skates,These skates are great my 13 year old daughter loves them and the extra padding was a great feature. I would recommend this to anyone who wants skates for a fair price.
5,Loving my new skates...,These are great skates for a great deal. Don't pass it up if you're looking to buy skates. I love them!
3,"if you wear 7.5, buy size 7.","I am size 7.5, but i thought i should get 8 incase they run small. I got it. it was too big, i had to return it. Communication was bad. I emailed them so many time, they just never responded my email. I had to get Amazon people involved to get my return & refund. Take your chance, i guess."
4,Great skates...just ordered too big a size...,"At the time, I figured it was a good idea to order a big size knowing that my daughter is still growing, but I'm not sure she'll ever fit the 6 I got her. But alas, they still look at skate great :)"
1,Poor Fit,"I ordered my daughter's size (7), even though the site said to order one size up. The skates were still a size and a half too big. If I had followed their instructions, they would have been 2 and a half sizes too big. When I asked for a return authorization number to return them (and told the company why) they said that I not only have to pay return shipping, but also a 20% restocking fee. Horrible way to do business. Will never order from them again. Wrote an e-mail to ask for help and try to get 20% restocking fee reduced, and never got an answer."
3,Not for an avid skater.,"While these skates would be good for a very, very casual ice skater, they are not for those who skate often. They are definitely not for those who figure skate. They are extremely thin with very little support. The tongue of the boot folds over and is very difficult to force into the proper position. This can create chafing and blisters. They aren't very comfortable, though they are much better than rental skates.Other reviews have said they are true to size, while still others have said they are not true to size. I ordered them true to size, and they were too big. I needed a whole size smaller than what I ordered. I gave these to a friend who skates maybe twice a year, and she is happy enough with them. So, if you don't skate often, these skates will probably be just fine for the price. But, if you do skate a lot, I'd stay away from these."
1,Women or men's size?,"I just bought a pair of size 7s a week ago, but I was disappointed when I received it. The size labeled on the tongue is US7,euro 39-40. But it turns out that is the men's shoe size conversion. I thought I ordered women's figure skates. Now I understand why some reviewers had right size, some had off size.......After contacting the seller, the receptionist told me I got what I paid for. The cheap skates size 7 is 25cm inside. The expensive ones can be right sized. You don't know what you will get if you order size 6 and above, it can be either men's size or women's size, although the name is Ladies Figure Skate! It depends on who is packing your shipping at the warehouse. Try your luck!"
5,Happy Grandma,"This not only was a great value,the pairs of skates I bought were well received....and well used...by my 'tween' and teen-aged grandchildren for recreational skating during this season of cold weather.They were shipped out right away to be enjoyed. I plan to purchase more from them for the rest of the grandkids!!"
3,OK for the price; wonky sizing; return logistics are tricky,"I wear a women's size 8.5 shoe so bought size 8 skates, since reviews suggested sizing down. They were too big -- would need at least half a size larger, maybe a full size. The skate box came wrapped in a cut-down Priority Mail envelope, so to return I will need to either put it in a larger cardboard box or wrap in brown paper. The return instructions had dire warnings about not taping, marking or otherwise altering the box they come in (with the threat of a restocking fee). So return is less convenient than for items fulfilled by Amazon.The skates themselves? They're basic, inexpensive ladies' skates. I went out to my local sporting goods store and spent a bit more to get some really comfortable, durable ones instead. They even sharpened them for free. Can't get that by mail order!"
4,Great for the price,"Bought these as a last minute purchase. Got them much sooner than expected. Comfort-wise they are okay. My ankle hurt after a while, but I think that was my own fault. For the price you can't go wrong."
5,Great skates!,"These skates worked great for me! As a recreational skater, I wanted skates that were not expensive but better than the rentals. Skatebuys sent the order promptly and the skates are very nice--great ankle support, good fit, and extremely reasonable price. A great bargain!"
5,Fabulous,I use this everyday I love how it sprays upside down best product ever especially great for people who workout and sweat it keeps ur back clear!!!!
3,well,I have full of acne on my back .don't know how is that works .seem not works on my case .so -so
3,its ok....,"it does what its supposed to do. it gets rid of acne. my only problems are that its ridiculously hard to squeeze out of the bottle and it doesnt really smell good or bad. its like squeezing out syrup thats been in the freezer for an hour. and when ur done taking a shower...u have no scent. i dont know if thats good or bad, but i personally like to smell really good after a shower."
4,"I love Neutrogena products, but I don't think ...","I love Neutrogena products, but I don't think I'd buy this one again. My skin felt cleaner but didn't look any better. Overall I found nothing I didn't like about this product. It just did nothing better for my skin that my regular soap does."
2,I really didn't like this body wash. The ...,I really didn't like this body wash. The smell was not pleasing and it left a film on my skin. I think the concept of microbeads in body wash is a bad one. I wouldn't recommend or purchase this product.
4,Works better than anything else I've tried thus far,"Works pretty darn well. Better than anything I've tried before... including the regular Neutrogena Body Wash.I thought the Pink Grapefruit was just a scent, and being a guy, in a choice between grapefruit scent or not, I'll take not, but apparently it is not just a scent. The pink grapefruit body wash worked where the regular wash did not."
5,Like it so far!,"The product doesnt have a strong smell, so I can wear it during the day. The spray mist is very light, so you don't get very wet or too straight of a spray. Its designed well and its the first time ive ever been able to use anything on my back because this makes it so easy to get coverage wherever you need it.----edit a few days later:been using it a few days and it hasnt helped any. well, Its hasnt helped in comparison to like when im able to run alcohol and zit cream on my back. But that isnt convenient. Will try a few more days and review again"
2,No change really...,"Hasn't done much for me, but I don't use it religiously. Maybe I'd get better results if I used it constantly."
4,Works Great! Doesn't leave stains or sour smell.,"Smells good. The other body washes by neutrogena (orange ones) actually give off a medical body odor smell that literally smells soury after a while and gross. They also stain your shower curtains and shower. Overrall this ones way better cause it smells natural and basically does the same job. I havent noticed any staining yet. I will however say to neutrogena, WTH happened to the green cream microclear body wash?? That stuff worked wonders on my back and they discontinued it. Anyways, this stuff does pretty good on my back but not as good as the microclear green body wash."
5,Best Body Wash Ever!,"This body wash was exactly what I was looking for. I don't have horrible body acne or anything, I just occasionally get break outs when it's hot and humid outside, or if I've been working out profusely. Once I started a running program, I bought this body wash and I haven't had a break out yet! It smells soooo good too. I loved the face wash and was happy to see that they made a body wash in the same scent. I probably will not use any other body wash again!"
2,Didnt really work for me!!,Dont really notice a difference prob i use it to much since I take a shower twice a day
5,This stuff works,"I was skeptical at first. But I have used it consistently for the last 6 months and my 'body acne' is gone. I would always have 3-4 pimples on my back, shoulders, neck or chest. Now I have zero."
2,Good but not Great,I used this item and I didnt notice much of a difference. I would not buy it again. I switched to another brand and I am now seeing an improvement.
2,Didn't work for me,"I've been using this wash for at least 3 weeks now, and instead of working as promised, my minimal acne turned into big red zits in my back and chest and multiplied the smaller zits. It does smell very good, though."
4,Acne Body Wash,I love it! It helps keep breakouts under control :) I also love the way it smells. The only thing is that I wish I could get a 44oz bottle :D haha I hate running out :/
5,Love the scrub!,I only use this now. It makes my skin clean and keeps it from getting acne or anything else. I no longer purchase the scrubs from Victoria Secret or BBW after I started using this. It is just strong enough not to dry out your skin.
3,Not Antibacterial....,"I bought this product last month, hoping to get rid of the acne on my upper arms and back. Well, it worked for about a week and a half or two weeks, and it cleared up my back and arms. However, it all came back, even though I hadn't stopped using the product. So I started mixing it with Dial antibacterial bodywash, and now the combination of the two works great! So overall, this is a good product, but it would be better if it were antibacterial."
3,Just okay!,"Doesn't give lather. No specific aroma. Is it just another soap or what?Clearly, Not a fan!Wouldn't recommend it."
4,Works quick to clear acne,"I bought this product for some chest and back breakouts. I usually use a little tube of benzoyl peroxide, but I went through so much of that for such a large area of my body. I've only used this stuff for a few days now, but my chest and back are much prettier and smoother. It just kind of makes my skin stiff if I don't apply lotion with. It can also burn the skin and the smell can burn my nose. I will continue to use and purchase this product!"
2,Stained my clothes!!,"I'm not sure if I was using too much of it or what, but it bleached my shirts after I sprayed it (and let it dry) on my shoulders!!"
2,Ehh,I too got a rash on my neck from using this product. It seemed to work for a couple weeks but now I am breaking out worse than before.
3,An okay acne wash,"It has a clean, pleasant enough smell that didn't linger very long on my skin, so that was a plus. I also have fairly sensitive skin, but it never once irritated it or dried it out.As for how well it worked as a body acne fighter? Within just a few days of using it I broke out in places that I never had pimples before. I can't say that was much of a surprise, as cleansers bring oil and dirt to the surface and I fully expected the acne problem to temporarily get worse before it got better. However, this problem didn't even begin to be rectified until more than halfway through the bottle. After the entire bottle had been used up the new acne brought on by this product's use was gone, yes, but the old acne wasn't as cleared as I would have liked.In the end it's an okay acne fighter, nothing I would rave about. It helped the pimples on my back to a certain degree, but not entirely."
3,spray,The spray is ok at best. Didn't see the results that I was looking for. The body scrub is a lot better!
4,it works!,"I exercise a lot and get all sweaty... I needed something to prevent the breakouts on my back. This does just that. After just 3 days you will notice it clear up. The bottle says that it can spray at all angles but it doesn't, hence the 4 stars."
3,Smells great?,"That is funny, I don't think it smells great at all! The little beads, oh bad addition. However, the item does work, although there is a little extra dryness that comes along with doing its job! I would opt for the original item...but a great cleanser"
3,I didn't like the feel of this product ...,I didn't like the feel of this product on my skin. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
4,good but could be better,"i got this album cause i was expecting an extremly wild crowd but i was disappointed you can't even hear the crowd rotten barely talked between the songs a ""wake up f*ckers"" would of do but no als rottens voice sounded wierder than usually i gave it 4 stars cause the things that went threw my head thinking of this concert so if you have a good imagination by all means buy it"
5,Very. Nice!,I bought this for my son in law. He loves the large size and easy storage that it has. Great gift.
3,The board is not wooden,"The board surface of this chess set is not wooden. The box frame is wood, but the surface is a nonwood laminate material. Very disappointing."
5,Portable Chess!,"This is a fine chess set that folds up and holds all the pieces inside. When folded, it easily fits in a suit case so you can take it with you. The pieces are held inside by an elastic so it's a bit of a hassle putting them all back. You also have to make sure that you don't put the wrong pieces across from each other or it won't shut. Overall, this is a good choice at a good price."
1,Piece missing,Gave this as a Christmas gift. I was so embarrassed when I found out there was a piece missing. Don't buy this set.
5,Very Practical,Product was as described. Very neat and practical. The pieces are well made and the board is nice and sturdy. Great board to play in.
5,Quality set at a reasonable price.,"I bought this chess set for my adult son. It is full size, attractive, well constructed and self-contained. What more can anyone ask for? :)"
4,adequate quality for the price.,picked this set because of the size and storage for the pieces. Quality adequate but not great.Suits the needed purpose.
1,Mis -Lead,Let me state the pieces are not placed intact in any way. They are tossed around inside the game. I purchased this on what another review stated about pieces being nicely held in tact. Boards don't meet when closed and lock is not even when shut. Not worth the money and quality not anything to rave about. Very unhappy.
2,"Very light pieces, Board made of very thin wood","A few reviews touch on this, but the weight of the pieces in this set is really an issue for me. I bought this set for my young daughter, and despite the other reviews, I thought ""Well, how light could the pieces really be?"" Turns out they are very light, and for young children this can be an issue as they are easily knocked over (the chess pieces, and probably the children too).The board itself is very light and thin as well. There are a few blemishes here and there. Collectively, even at this low price, I would not recommend purchasing this chess set. I think it would be better to spend a little more money to get heavier pieces and a better quality board."
5,chess set,"Item was perfect for my 11-year old chess player. Very nice quality, and very reasonable price. I am totally pleased with this puchase. Shipping was also very fast."
1,Came with the wrong pieces,I gave this set to my son for Hannukah. It came with three bishops instead of a white queen. The return window on it has expired now (I shop early) and my son is stuck with a defective chess set. Very poor product.
4,"Good quality chess set, great gift!","I bought this set for my boyfriend so that we could play chess more often, it has definitely served it's purpose. It's lightweight but durable and it's portable, with elastics to hold the pieces inside the board when it's folded. Overall, we're very satisfied :)"
3,Expected More,"My biggest gripe with this set are the pieces. They are so light and just feel cheap. Other reviews said there were some weight to the pieces and for a $35 dollar set I expected them to have a bit of weight to them, but they are extremely light. Don't like their feel at all. Also the description says there are straps that hold the pieces in place inside, but there are none! The pieces just come in bags but are otherwise loosely stored. I'm not pleased with this at all. As for the board itself, it seems good. No issues with the board itself, but the pieces and lack of straps are very disappointing. The whole thing feels like a $20 set."
3,Not Bad,"This chess set is advertised with the king standing 3.25 inches tall but it only barely stands 3 inches tall. Other than that, this is a pretty good standard chess set for your dollar."
4,What I expected,"Item exactly as described. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The only downside is that the pieces are not weighted. Besides, the set is a lot of fun"
1,Never purchase from this company,"Received item weeks late. Is missing a piece (which makes playing chess a little difficult). Received no reply from email query to their site asking for replacement piece. Do not EVER purchase from this site.The sooner that you exercise your rights as a consumer, the sooner that service will return to the service industry."
3,Great,"This CD was the Bomb. Listening to it brought back memories of that time in my Life, me and all my friends gathered around listening to Vinyl when a lot of those Songs were originally released."
4,Blast to the Past,What a cute story this was and is! I enjoyed going back and experiencing it again after many years. My whole family enjoyed it. Just cute! No very deep concepts. Easy to watch and laugh with.
5,A wholesome TV show that is very cute.,"I never take the time to review DVDs, but Gidget was just a great old TV show from ""back in the day"" when sex did not have to be in your face all the time. There are some sexual inuendos in the show that are perfectly fine and believable, and the show is just good clean fun. A teenage girl who wants to date and have fun, but is also very close to her daddy. What a nice concept!"
5,Loved this show so much!!,I watched this show as a teenager in the 90's. I miss innocent tv shows these days. Buying this on amazon instant because I miss it that much! I want my daughter to watch it too. :)
3,No CD with the book,I didn't get the CD with the book. Book was in good quality. It was delivered on time. I had no problems. CD is required to listen to the notes.
5,joy in rising to the challenge,"Succinct presentation - no belaboring. No lesson goes on for more than two pages, including music theory! Easy to read; I finished 'reading' in less than week; playing it is another matter! I've since re-read it several times, highlighting, marking and cross-referencing etc.Parkening believes in interspersing lessons with attractive study pieces - to encourage ... and it works - well ... a most attractive and fulfilling way to learn. Parkening does not seem to hold back any subtlety; he conveys the fine points, required to produce varied and attractive guitar sounds - to get the most out of the instrument.If only these volumes existed when I was younger, life might have gone in different directions. Nothing but praise for the Parkening approaches to introducing the classical guitar to newcomers. Fabulous value; you won't regret a penny of it."
3,"GREAT LESSONS, JUST DROP THE GOD TALK","I just finished the first two volumes of the Christopher Parkening Method as an adult beginner to the guittar. They are an excellent source for the first year or two on the instrument. Mr. Parkening presents the material at a pace that is both challenging and conducive to maximizing practice time while not pushing the envelope too fast. My only complaint are the extraneous bible thumper exhortions that pepper the volumes. Please Mr. Parkening, I picked up your books to learn guittar not to be harassed about your religion,otherwise I would have given you five stars."
1,do not buy,"I was very disappointed that upon the 3rd use of this product, the brush part completely came apart without any pressure! The glue that they use to attach the brush part completely separated from the handle."
2,Boring Book!,"Yang the Youngest was an OK book.It was sort of boring and didn't grab my attention.In the beginning, there was nothing really happening.I only found out that a boy named Yintao was tone deaf and his parents made him play the violin. Since all his siblings played their instruments very well, he was expecteed to alsoIn the middle of the book, Yingtao found out he had to play in a concert with his siblings. He and his friend Matthew make a plan that Matthew will play his violin insted of Yingtao. Matthew would be behind a screen and Yingtao would ""bow synk"". This part was a little better.At the end, Yingtao's and Matthew's plan is underway, and it didn't work out so well.This book is boring.I would recomend this book to people who like music."
1,Not my type of book,"Yang the Youngest is a boy who wants to play baseball, but his parents want him to work on his violin playing. The only problem is that Yang has a terrible ear and isn't good at music. Yang's friend Mathew wants to play violin, but his parents want him to play baseball. I didn't like the book because I like books with battles, nature and history in them. This book didn't have any of those."
3,"Not for me, but a good book","Yang the Youngest is about a little boy named Yingtao that just moved from Shanghai and has a hard time fitting in. At school he doesn't know the American customs, and at home he's the only one in his family who stinks at music. On top of that there is a big recital coming up. Will Yang make it?I like more comedy in books than seriousness, so this wasn't quite the book for me, but it was good."
4,"It's serious, but I liked it.","In Yang the Youngest a young boy is the only one in his family who isn't musical. There is a recital coming up that Yang is supposed to play in, but he's not ready. Oh no! Yang loves to play baseball but his father wants him to do violin. On the other hand, Yang's friend Mathew loves to play violin but his father wants him to play baseball.I thought the book was really good, but not awesome. It was serious, but not all the time. I liked that there was no violence in it."
3,My mom laughed out loud,"The book is about a boy from China named Yang and his family who move from China to Seattle, and are trying to fit in. He has a one brother and two sisters, second sister and third sister. His father and mother are professional musicians. But Yang cannot play his violin because he can't hear the difference between high and low notes. There is a big recital coming up so his dad can get more music students. Yang has to play at the recital. What will he do? Meanwhile Yang meets a boy named Mathew and they become friends.I think there was a lot of talking and not a lot of action in the book. This is not my favorite book, but I thought it was funny. Some of the times it was really funny, my mom even laughed out loud. I suggest that this book is read aloud first then to yourself."
3,"Realistic, but no evil!","The book is about a boy who just moved from China to the U.S. He lives with his mom, dad, 2 sisters, and brother. His family are big time musicians and he stinks at it. Yang tries his hardest to be good at the violin, but he just can't hear the difference between each note. And to make matters worse, a big bully is bullying him. And to top that off, a big recital is coming up for father to get more students. Will Yang make it or not?I like the fact that in the book Yang has the kind of trouble that kids really have. But I wish it had more suspense and evil people."
2,More Action Please,"The book is about a boy named Yingtao that just moved from China to Seattle with his mother, father, eldest brother, 2nd sister, and third sister. In Seattle Yingtao meets Mathew. Mathew likes baseball and teaches Yang to play. Yang quickly picks up basbeall and becomes pretty good at it. But when Yang's father finds out about the baseball he gets really mad and tells him he can't play baseball until his violin playing improves. That's hopeless because he has a terrible ear for music. He can't play the violin well because he's tone deaf.There were some funny parts to this book, but I like books with more action. This was mostly conversation."
5,12 years on and still going strong,"This disc was my first introduction to the Breeders way back in 1993. I was at Newbury Comics, the mecca of the Boston music scene, when Don't Call Home came on overhead. When that guitar solo hit, all conscious control over my body was taken from me. I went up to the counter and demanded to know the name of this band. Since that day, I have listened to this disc at least a thousand times and it never gets old. Recently, I saw the Breeders live at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, CA. I then broke out the Safari disc again and it sounded as fresh as the day that I first heard it in 1993. Very few pieces of popular music have the power to burn into your memory the exact moment that you first heard it. This disc did it for me. Greatest guitar solo I have ever heard. Check this disc out!!"
4,Poetry for Young People,Poetry for Young People by Emily Dickinson is a wonderful book for young readers. Although I do not usually read poetry books I truly enjoyed Dickinson's poems. A lot of the poems in this book are very short but they are also very interesting. All of these poems are unique and very clever. Reading some of her poems is about the same as looking at a picture of what she is describing because she illustrates things so vividly and with so much imagery. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys poetry.
2,The poems are 'edited',"Apparently, young people aren't able to appreciate dashes. Emily Dickinson has a long history of having her poems edited horribly. Keep her dashes, and it's sad that they haven't kept the poem numbers. At least they didn't make up titles for the poems and used the first lines in the index."
2,Not my comisky,"This book has been over-rated. Promoted as the ""summer of 1977"" this picture book is apparently the result of one or two afternoons (a Cleveland day game). Don't expect any pictures of baseball or the White Sox (there are 2-3), even though 1977 was one of the most exciting years in their history. While the pictures capture some of the parks' essence, they are very depressing. 90% are shots of forlorn fans that look like they are watching a last place team, when in fact this was a first place team. Old comisky had a lot of beauty that was missed here. I was there that summer and it didn't look like that."
5,Pure Pleasure,This book has nothing to do with baseball and everything to do with people and community and one unique little corner of the world as it looked 24 years ago. I enjoyed it and I wasn't there. Looking at it with someone who was is even more fun.
5,The prima donna of America,"La Price has the greatest, most beautiful soprano of the last 50 years or so. She had a career that is AS GREAT as that of Sutherland or Callas. She was, in short, a credit to American sopranos. Her voice is just so thrilling and glorious.To supplement this wonderful cd, you MUST have a video to go with it. I mean that video must have Price in her prime like this cd.Along with this ""Leontyne Price re-discovered"", I highly recommend the DVD...Great Stars of Opera - Telecasts from the Bell Telephone Hour 1959-1966. It shows the young Leontyne in her greatest roles, the diva singing arias from Aida and Tosca. It also has Franco Corelli, Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland and the great Eileen Farrell. It's a must have!"
5,"Brava, America's great Prima donna!","But as huge fans of Price you must have the video of the diva. if you love this recital asI do.This video of Price ,IN both prime and in flawless voice is a dvd call...Great Stars of Opera- Telecasts from the Bell Telephone Hour 1959-1966.It is as good as this essential recital and the sound is far better. And you get to see thisgreatest of singers as she sing. The dvd also has Tebaldi, Eileen Farrell, Rise Stevens and a young JoanSutherland. You have to have the video if you get this cd. The DVD shows the 60's as the goldenage of opera. Today's artist just don't compare to this!"
1,Callas rules,"Price has a pretty voice, a dime a dozen. But she does not have the drama of Callas. Only Callas is the Prima Donna of America and all over the world. Price is nothing next to her."
5,Jack Vance's Long Lost Cousin,"I picked this one up because the author's name was familiar (a long story), and am happy to say it was the best move I've made in a long time. If you enjoy Jack Vance as much as I do, and have been searching for another author with the same high level of flair, wit, and style, then you'll be happy to hear that you've finally found one. His name is Yves Meynard. If you didn't already know this novel had been written by someone else you would swear you were reading a previously undiscovered Vance story -- which, in my opinion, is the highest compliment that can be paid to *any* writer. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed with this novel, and any future works by Yves Meynard should be added to your ""buy on sight"" list."
2,Very Dull Finish,"The stool would be fine but the finish is SO dull that is almost looks like it is painted gray! If you want a dull finished stool then it is perfect - but do not expect any shine at all - the picture shows shine but there is NONE - dull, dull, dull...UPDATE: I wanted to add a 5-star rating for Home Decorator's customer service - they are sending me a UPS return label for the product and will issue a prompt refund upon receipt. All of this is less than 24 hours of contacting them!"
2,Would have been better as a short film.,"Slow as molasses story about a woman who accidentally gashes her leg in a fall and soon becomes obsessed with playing with the wound and in creating more cuts. That's about it. It always amazes me how filmmakers can take a 20 minute idea and tell it in 93 minutes.For other, better, females gone strange check out: REPLUSION, MAY, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?, KISSED and MISERY. Hell even the boring NEKROMANTIK 2 was more eventful than this snoozer."
2,Weak,"There's no real violence here. Just some crazy, french chick that wipes blood from a knife onto her skin. Ohhhhh, I use the same 'horrifing' technique to put mayonaise on sandwiches. Some elements were entertaining, such as her attempt to conceal her insanity from her boyfriend and colleages, which built suspense and tension. Worth renting, but good luck finding a wierdo-foreign film like this at a rental store. I mean 'wierdo-foreign film' in a good way of course."
5,Sturdy.,"Got this bag for a Line 6 POD HD 500 which fit perfectly, looks and feels like it will last, reasonably priced, quick free shipping."
5,Perfect for my Needs,"I do part time transcription and since I also have a full time office job the time I have to do my typing can vary greatly. I've taken to doing transcription while on my lunch break and found that packing up my laptop, foot pedal, full size wireless keyboard and other accessories had become a chore. I was looking for a bag to carry all of this in but something not excessively large or expensive. This bag does the trick quite nicely. I realize it's designed for a small keyboard but if you're looking for a reasonably priced bag to carry a laptop (mine is 14"" with a heavy, 12-cell battery), full keyboard and all your accessories without having to shell out $50-100 then this may be something you want to look into. I love this bag!"
4,Really good protective case!,"I use this for my POD X3 Live and it works ok. It's not really a good fit for it, but it works. The case is well made and great for the money. I wish someone would make a good case specifically for the X3 live though."
3,Gator Micro Bag GK-2110,"Bag overall is of good quality: very heavy fabric, well-sewn; decent shoulder strap with a small pad. After a month of moderate use, the zipper on the accessory pouch would no longer clasp. This was just past the Amazon 30-day policy so I had to deal with Gator directly. They issued an RMA number but I had to pay shipping to their address. This is still pending (about 2 weeks at the time of this post). On one hand, things like this happen; but on the other, I would think that quality of zippers should be of little or no concern since zipper technology has changed little, in over 100 yrs. I bought this on price alone, so perhaps I got what I paid for, but I would give them one more chance before ruling them out entirely."
4,Works great for Control 2,"I bought this for the Digitech Control 2 foot controller, and it fits perfectly. I use the outer pocket for the foot controller for a Mesa Boogie Mark IV. Although the Mesa controller just fits, it is a very tight fit, and I fear it might wear out the pocket over time. Perfect for the Control 2, though."
4,"An excellent, no nonsense book","This book is essential reading for all English teachers. It has been great for me as I have used it daily with my TEFL course, and will be referring to it for many months I guess. I'm sure though that there are many English teachers who already feel they are experienced but would benefit from Harmer's book as ""every day's a school day!"""
5,The BEST Headphones for the price,I have had these headphones for about 5 months or so and I must say that these are AMAZING. I am always skeptical from buying things online but when I read these reviews I took a chance and Loved the decision. These ARE LOUD AND CLEAR! I needed a pair that can block out all the sound around me and these did just the trick. They are comfortable and are built to last. I am a music artist and whenever I go into the studio at my label I prefer to use these over the ones they provided. I don't mean any offense but u must be stupid to not buy these!!! BUY THEM NOW!!! U WONT REGRET IT!!!
3,"For the price, not too shabby!","I purchased this pair of headphones a few weeks ago and although I'm not keeping them, I must say for the price they're not too bad in quality. Ultimately I decided to go with something a bit lighter and more powerful, but obviously the price wasn't gonna be the same either. If you're looking for a pretty good sound quality at a great price point then this is definitely for you. Although I decided to return the item, I'd recommend them to anyone looking for some headphones at a great value."
1,"Bad fit, felt cheap","I bought these for my mom for christmas and never gave them to her bc they felt cheap and really hurt my head when i put them on. I was looking for a cheaper headphone that was reviewed well as ""comfortable"" and these were definitely not it.The leather ears look plasticy and the top band is very very rigit. I'm not expecting bose, but these were nowhere close.would not buy again."
2,You get what you paid for,"Lots of static on headphones, but I guess you get what you pay for. I bought this for my husband's amp so he could play on his guitar. The cord is nice and long so it's perfect for that."
3,OK - Good for the low price,"I didn't pay much for these, and i didn't expect much. They are actually be better than I hoped, but I would not recommend them for anyone looking for serious headphones."
3,relax,"This device looks so pro and the sound is alright in this price range. The only problem with it is that it's so tide that I can feel like something clipping on my head after 20 minutes even my head is not that big. Feel headache when wearing it for long but that is what I paid for the low price. I also bought another one that is twice the price (ATH-M30) and it's much better sounds and more comfortable that this behringer HPS300. I still keep this headphones as I can use it and live with it as return shipping would be half of the price for this device. Just keep it until it dead or I will bend it to make it more wider until it's going to break a part or will get use to it. Think twice before you buy. If you think you can get use to it, then buy it."
4,Fantastic,"When I got these headphones I was very exided to use them. The sound quality is fantastic on them, but they are not as sound canceling as beats by dre are. I enjoy having the adapter that comes built into it that allows me to plug it into my bass guitar amp. Over all this ia a fantastic product and is sold for a great deal."
2,Didn't last long,"I've owned these headphone for about 6 months, and they are already cutting out and giving me choppy audio. I take very good care of my electronics, so it was a disappointment when they started to fail on me. I had to throw them away today- hence the review as a response. Would not recommend."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"I was really skeptical and did a lot of research on these headphones. I am a sucker for reviews but i take them all with a grain of salt, so when i read the handful of negative reviews, I figured the people were exaggerating and for roughly twenty bucks, these were worth a shot. When I received them, I was so excited that I immediately fired them up and I was actually really impressed with the sound. They have a really crisp high end paired with a nice rounded bottom end that results in a very lively clear sound. The problem isn't the sound quality...it's the headphone's plastic parts that are very cheaply made. I opened my set around 3pm and by 6pm that same day, the left earpiece had broken...no big deal...but then two days later i plug them in to my mac via the 1/8 plug and get nothing...i know, i know...you get what you pay for, but i had hoped to get more than a week outta these guys. Amazon was great in letting me return them too. PLEASE READ THE REVIEWS!"
2,HELL NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,OKAY SO I JUST GOT THESE HEADPHONES LITERALLY LIKE 15MINS AGO. NOT A FAN OF IT. I MEAN ITS GOOD IF YOU LOOKING FOR REGULAR HEADFONES BUT THESE THINGS HAVE NO BASS AT ALL. LIKE AT ALL. I WAS EXPECTING BLOW MY EARS AWAY TYPE TYPE LOUDNESS AND IN BASS AND WAS DISAPPOINTED. ITS NICE AND EVERYTHING BUT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR HEADFONES WITH ALOT OF BASS AND FOR THEM TO BE EXTRA LOUD THESE ARE NOT THE TYPE OF HEADFONES I WOULD RECOMMEND.
1,Where's the bass? Where's the quality?,"First, I must say that the shipping was fantastic. It was delivered before the estimated delivery date. Props on that one. Now to the headphones. Horrible. Just horrible. When I took it out of the package, it felt like it's only worth maybe 10 dollars. I thought ""ehh. It just feels cheap."" But as soon as I played a song AT 75% VOLUME, there was few, if not, no bass whatsoever. Sounded muggy and unclear. Oh, and another thing. The right ear had a buzzy noise to it. I think I got a used pair. I returned them right when I got it. IT was that bad. So I invested in a top of the line Audio Technica M50's. If you want quality, please don't be cheap. But if you just want some sort of device that can play back music, be my guest and pick this one. I recommend all of you to read this whoever is looking for quality."
2,horrible sensitivity,"Brought this for two weeks. The sound is very loud, which is a good for me when I'm doing recording. Sound quality is nice, good mid to bass sound. The earphone is in fact silver, not white as see in the picture.However, the frustrating thing is that the ear cup has horrible sensitivities, every time I move my head, the sound on the right cup went out. And minutes after fixing it by padding the outer layer of the cup, it went out again. I'm just so pissed, I have no reason not to give it a 2 stars."
1,One Headphone didn't even work! Don't Buy!,"The headphones came in, I plugged them in and they never worked. I wouldn't buy, good deal but you pay for what you get..."
3,Not the greatest,"I got a pair for $19, so they're definitely cheap for big noise cancelling headphones. As to noise cancelling not really that much, they're alright. If it's simply for entertainment use they're fine, sound quality is acceptable, the bass isn't amazing but it does the job. However, if you're willing to spend a few more bucks I'd stick to the Seinheisser HD202, they're around 28 dollars now, I got them for $23 and the only reason I bought these Behringer's is because my HD202 right ear cup cable got tangled up and is currently out of service. being in school and everything I was too lazy to get a soldering iron to fix them. In any case, these headphones are cheap and do the job so far. They seem bulky but they're very light."
2,Headphones,"I own many thousands of dollars of Behringer products and the quality/value is great. But DON'T buy these headphones. The sound is tinny and muffled. Bass response is ok but the sound quality is very poor. Again, 95% of the time I am a HUGE Behringer fan and stand behind their products and company. They are not the best, but they ARE the best for price and value and having a moderately good product."
2,Buy something better,"Never trust a product that comes with a piece of paper in the box that says to beat the cup on your palm if you get static. While the static does go away after beating the thing up, it will come back and you have to beat it up some more. The cord is cheap and has to sit just right to avoid getting sound from just one side.After messing with the cord and beating the cup against your palm they do sound pretty decent. They are not too heavy for a normal persons head and your ears go inside of the cups so there is isolation without the ear pain that is common with those headsets that just sit on top of your earsAll in all, these headphones have turned me against buying any Behringer headsets in the future. If I run across any other Behringer product that interests me, I will research them to death before dishing out my hard earned money."
5,Very good sound for the money,"I ordered these headphones as part of a karaoke setup. The are far more than adequate for that task. Very, very good fidelity make these phones excellent for simply listening to music. Yes, they're old fashioned ear covering heavy earphones, but they also block outside noise very well, meaning you can listen to music without annoying distractions. For checking sound in a bar using your mixer monitor features, it's perfect.I highly recommend this product."
3,not what I expected,This head phones are very paded and fit nicley on the ears however these are definetly not studio head phones they may be okay for general listenning to music but for recording and that sort of thing get something else
3,Okay....,These headphones are okay but the inner material used to cuff the earphones themselves starts to peel with use. That's the only thing I don't like about them. I do use them to mix my audio and they've worked well for me so far.
2,Really not that good,"These headphones really aren't that good. My cheap in-ear skullcandy earbuds have vastly superior sound quality. Kinda disappointed, but they were pretty cheap, so... meh! =)"
4,suprisingly great sound,"I was skeptical of these headphones, because they were a little cheaper. Price does not define the quality of these headphones.The bass is deep and rich, the treble is clear and high and they block out a great deal of outside sounds. I would recommend them to anyone, even my grandmother."
1,Absolutely garbage !,Im no Audiophile but these are complete and utter garbage. My Panasonic headphones that are 10 years old (29.99) blow these away. These headphones are heavy on the bass and its distored bass mind you. They have very little mid range capability. The highs are completely missing alltogether. Maybe if you turn your treble all the way up you can hear vocals but I doubt it. My advice buy the Plantronics GameCom 367 Closed-Ear Gaming Headset for the occasional gamer/music listener. These Plantronics have a well balanced sound good enough for the occasional user. (ASIN: B001E45XT4)
2,Broken Earcup,"Although I purches this product in December 2009, I didn't get a chance to use it until Jan,2010. I put them on, listened to some various formats of music with them then, went to lift them off of my head and the right Earcup broke off. And now of course it is too late to send them back for a replacement pair."
1,poorly made!!,The sound is great BUT 3 days after getting it the left ear cup detached and can not be fixed and i just gave up trying to return it!!
1,Purely awful,These headphones I would compare to the cheap $9 pair you might buy at a drug store. They are not meant to use for anything that requires being able to hear at any volume level. They may look like better headphones but they are flimsy and the audio quality is awful. If you are in a loud room forget trying to use them because the audio level can't get up loud enough to hear anything. I bought them because of all the good reviews on Amazon but they were a major disappointment. These are purely throw away.
1,Great product. . .for a day.,"Headphones uncerimoniously quit working after one day of use at my PC. Actually, to be specific, left channel works great, right channel is dead. Unfortunately, I through away the packaging. Fortunately, these were only $18. Should have stuck with Sennheiser I guess."
4,I like them a lot,"They are amazing the best headphones that i ever had., but yesterday my left speaker went out for no reason i don't b know if i can fix it."
4,OK for the price,"This headphones are well built, especially the plugin connector and the cushions, but they are not very comfortable on top of head. They deliver better sound than my 3 old Bose Triport, and they isolate exterior noise much better.The sound is not that astounding, but it is OK for the price and for a fine brand like this. I would prefer paying for this ones than for the lower end headphones from Bose, which cost more than $130 and wont deliver much better quality than this one.I just received them today, I hope they will last, especially the cushions, which were the first to severely deteriorate with my Bose triport."
3,In the middle!!,Behringer HPS3000 headphones needs power. The bass is great and what really needs is a power to boost the quality of sounds. I just cant appreciate it much due to audio power concern.
5,I love them!,"I've read several bad reviews for the Behringer HPS3000, but I have to say my experience has been nothing but pleasant. The sound quality is crisp, clear, and completely immersive. The bass is shockingly powerful. The length of the cord is extremely convenient. And the tilted ear cup provides decent comfort. I would personally prefer a slightly larger ear cup, but for someone with slightly smaller ears, these are fully recommended :)"
3,"Decent sound, didn't fit my receiver","The sound quality was fine, not spectacular, when tested with my Sony Walkman mp3 player (which has great sound adjustment options). However, the threads on the plug that allow for the 1/4"" adapter kept it from plugging into my surround sound receiver port all the way, a big disappointment."
2,"Inexpensive, but disappointing","These don't cost a whole lot, but you get what you pay for.Sound quality is alright, but somewhat hollow. They aren't terribly comfortable on the top of the head *or* over the ears - that being said, I have kind of big ears. Sound leakage is also a big problem, which was the ultimate deal-killer for me.I think I'm going to return these. Disappointing."
5,Good enough to me!,"Just started using them when my buddy and I set up a sound-check for our minature studio. One of the reviewers said they were too small for his head. He was right. He IS a mutant. My friend commented how snug he liked them around his ears before I told him about the complaint of them being too small. I admit I can't compare them to other headphones considering these are the first pair I ever bought, they were cheap, they sound good, and they arrived on time.Sincerely,A cat always lookin for a cheapass deal"
4,Nice for the price,"One thing you can't beat Amazon on is selection. Finding a pair of headphones to keep the windows from rattling while I practice my bass was difficult in brick and mortar stores. These phones are comfortable, inexpensive and work very well for what I need. I found myself also using them for listening to music and, compared to ear buds, they are excellent. For the price, they sound good, but the high end frequency response could be better. I guess that doesn't matter for practicing bass guitar though."
3,Gigantic headphones with OK sound,The sound from these and the quality of plastics used are not bad. What is bad is they're gigantic! You can also hear them a lot when they're on someone's head and the volume isn't up very high. Sound leaks from the outside. I dont like that.
4,Great inexpensive pair of headphones,I purchased these headphones as a cheap pair of headphones to take to work. I have found no complaint in these headphones. They feel pretty solid in their overall construction. They are all plastic and fairly comfortable to wear for hours at a time. The sound quality is decent as the bass response is not amazing but I am not very picky on sound.
3,You get what you pay for,"The Behringer HPX2000 are very good $20 headphones. They are NOT $49 or $100 Professional DJ Headphones..... The are 100% plastic, no metal except for the plug. Sound is very good for $20, the ear cups do rotate 360 which is very cool, but they DO NOT seal out noise, like true $49 - $100 headphones do. Do not pay shipping as they retail for $20 everywhere. Buy at Overstock or your local store. I regret paying $6 shipping. I do not regret paying $19 for the headphones as they are worth the money."
2,Not very good sound.,"How hard is it to find a pair of headphones that sound good??? I was extremely disappointed when I plugged these in. A very, very, ""boxy"" midrange sound. No low end to speak of. Terrible sound. It's a shame too, because I have other Behringer products that sound fantastic. Pass these by."
2,Not for proffesional use,if you're waiting for some top off the line and under de budget headphones... try something else
1,Behringer High-Performance Studio Headphones HPS3000,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLEthe worst thing i have ever bought. heavy, huge, terrible sound. better off spending the money on headsets from Target."
3,Big and bulky for no reason.,"I got these for my daughter for while she is learning to play the guitar. They were affordable, are comfortable and I am happy with them in that regard but I tried them out one day to try and block out some sound while I was studying and in terms of blocking out external sound they seem next to useless. In my opinion the only reason to have big bulky cans like these is for some kind of isolation, in this regard these headphones just do not cut it."
4,"Great headset for the price, and for the right use","I purchased this headset several weeks ago and I am very pleased with it. First the fit of the headset is very comfortable for me. I am an amateur radio operator and I use this headset with my Kenwood TS-440SAT High Frequency transceiver. The audio quality is very good for that use. (Keep in mind, I am listening to Single Side Band voice communications with this headset, not high quality music.) I have used it for listening to podcasts, and pandora on my Android smart phone and again the audio quality is very good as far as I am concerned. For the price you cannot go wrong."
4,"Sturdy and Good Sound, yes. Noise Cancelling, no.","Sound quality is great and they hold up great. I just wish that they were noise cancelling. They also come with a jack that lets you plug into a 1/4 inch input, which improves its ease. I use it on my guitar amp, my PS3, and my IPOD. Its for someone who wants good sound for an affordable price."
5,Infinite insights volume 1,This volume completes the complete set for me and I am well pleased...I feel closer to Mr.Parker through his writings. I recommend this set to any martial artist who desires to understand American Kenpo on a deeper level.
5,Outstanding,Provides outstanding advice and hope for those of us in middle age and beyond. Love is not dead.
2,Very little passion,"I found this book very disappointing. I later ordered ""Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty"" and got the information and passion and resources I was looking for. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Good for her!!!,"It's a great story. But this book, definitively is not a book for all women it's for this particular case, it does not work for everyone looks like only for the author, ended."
1,it's NOT true,I read this book and I tried to be open mind. BUT I THINK THIS LOVE WILL NEVER BE FOR EVER.
1,You must be joking......,"Young men don't want older women. That is a fallacy. They prefer young, tight bodies. Men with money and position don't want older women, they can and do have much younger women. Realistically, a young man may ""test drive"" an older woman, but that is all it will be, a test drive and a limited engagement, if it goes beyond 1 night. Older women are not attractive to younger men or to men with money and position. We can, and do, afford, much better. Sorry, but these are the facts."
4,Interesting and Motivational,"Sheehy provides an interesting summary of a number of women aged 50-or-so who have decided to either stop being stymied by loveless/abusive marriages, or to stop/avoid becoming spinsters. Pleasing themselves, pushed by a sense of mortality, becomes the focus. As a result, they meet other men, often discover oral sex, and experience a steady stream of orgasms that replace the barrenness of before.Often these women connect with younger men, though usually only for a period of months - regardless, the women find the experience permanently enhances their self-esteem and is liberating.Certainly beats growing old without the pleasures of the flesh!"
5,beautiful!,"I was looking for an eyeshadow without all the chemicals and something I could wear at night just to add a little color around my eyes. I only use natural, organic makeup and had never heard of this brand. After using it a couple of time, I just love this product! The color is awesome, and a little goes a long way! Comes off easily with soap and water. Now I'm ready to try some of the other colors in this line!"
5,A Parent's and Student-Athlete's Guide to Athletic Scholarsh,"I wish this book had been available when my student athlete daughter was considering her college choice. It is an easy to use resource filled with practical guides for navigating what is available to students.Information on putting together a videotape, documents needed, the school visit and negotiating guidelines will assist anyone going through this process. There is a huge list of colleges and universities covering the type of athletic scholarship each offers. This is a gift book I will be giving friends and family."
3,Not for 1998 Toyota Camry V6,These pads do not fit a 1998 Toyota Camry V6 as advertised. I'm really glad it's easy to send stuff back to Amazon.
5,Outstanding!,"Quiet and 10 times more durable than all the other brands I have tried. Hardly any brake dust.The stopping power is far superior, especially when other brakes would overheat during heavy use. Very pleased with Amazon price also."
1,Poorly Proofread,This won't be much help to collectors. Many album titles listed in the discographies are wrong as well as release dates. I still pick it up from time to time just for a laugh and every time I do I find another error.
2,Prefer soft sounds.,"It would seem like the tones should put you to rest. But for me the woodwinds seemed a little harsh - using to fall asleep did not do it for me. I prefer ""Inner Peace"". No question, that will take to right into deep sleep."
4,Not the band w/ Sebastian Bach,"WARNING: This is not the band that debuted in 1989! This is an Irish band from the early 70s with a very young Gary Moore on guitars. This is bluesy hard rock. You can hear the talent on this record much like Alex Skolnick in Testament. Years after the band broke up, they lost the rights to the name and it was picked up by some derelict New Jerseyites. It is enjoyable. The other album they released was self-titled."
5,Gary moore is amazing,This is a true lost classic album Gary moore is only 16 yrs old on this album you should hear the guitar riffs on this lp amaing.THis CD is hard to find now though.
3,PISTOLS DO ROCK,It's pure pistols .......but unless your a real fan the sound quality .... clarity?....is abit lacking.
3,the way they were,the author writes from exactly the perspective that she is...a child. a few years of additional maturity and possibly the added maturing addition of being a mother herself would have improved the value of the advice she doles out. humoursly she consistently labels herself and her audience the adult child. the chapter ending pointers are the only keepers here.
3,"All cotton is lovely, but the fit is a bit tight","This is a great all cotton bra from a company I like, Just My Size. I would buy a lot of them except that the back strap where it hooks seems unusually small and difficult to hook. Other bras in the same size don't have this problem. Maybe buying the next size larger would solve this problem."
5,Great Bras!,"These JMS cool and comfortable bras are not only a great deal, they launder and dry just like new! The seller is great, and delivered my items quickly."
5,Very comfortable bra that lasts a long time,"I have worn this bra for about 3 years now, and I love it! I used to wear underwire bras, but after trying this one out, I will never wear wires on a daily basis again! This bra looks good and lifts as well. I will be buying this bra for years to come!"
2,Didn't Last Long,"I got this end of May 2012 and I noticed about 6 months later one of the hooks had broken off and it was failing apart.It never fit tight, I ordered it that way, so it should have held up better, but I only paid $11.71 for it."
4,"Dude, this album...",I LOVE this album. Sounds awesome and the variations on some of the songs like King Tubby's version of Fugitive Dub.... WOW. Brings me back to my THPS days.
5,Great CD for Middle Eastern Dancers or anyone else!,"This CD is wonderful! Nearly every cut is a very dancable piece. Plus there are translations of the songs inside, so you know what you're dancing to. I just can't be still when I'm playing this one."
4,"Fun, sweet, a joy for the senses!","This album is highly rated on my Launch Radio Station. I love Amr Diab, and introducing me to the other artists will only help increase my world music collection."
2,Who Forced Steely Dan Into This,"That is what I thought when I heard about this CD. Messrs. Fagin and Becker are notoriously press and publicity-shy so for them to appear on this program seemed like a stretch.McPartland tries so hard to get them to open up, it is only with the greatest reluctance that they do. If anything, Becker seems the more genial, Fagin is almost monosyllabic through the entire show.The standard Steely Dan fare is routine, the Ellington stuff is quite good. Marian McPartland really earned her pay for this show."
2,It didn't smell good...,Unfortunatly didn't know the smell but... what can I spect for a product that cost as much as the mail?
3,A Lot of Info,"I saw this book at my foot doctor's office and was intrigued. It has a lot of information. I learned my cat can't see clearly up close to my face so that's why she gets that hypnotic look in her eyes. Has a lot of facts about cats, glad I bought it."
1,It Doesnt ever deserve one star,"I have seen some of the things written in this book and i must say i cant say how much i think it is wrong in atleast one area on page 111 it lists the dogs that are not safe around cats one of the breeds listed is the Great Pyrenees a working dog breed used for protecting sheep and other live stock it says that it was ""unsafe"" to let them alone with cats that is very very wronge maybe some more research should have been done I have bred and raised Great Pyrs for years and grew up with my parents raising them also we had them around everything from cats to horses to birds and very small kids we have never had anything go wronge with them if anything they would always protect them from danger and keep them out of touble My thoughts are that ther should have been more research done before that statment was made"
5,Nice Nike Watch - Good price!!!,"I've found this watch very nice for a really good price (I needed it fast, so shipment was almost 50% of the watch cost), considering it is a Nike. According to my wife (the one who is using it) it's very comfortable, keeps time OK and the backlume is good (pushing the crown). It's not easy to pull the crown to set time, but not impossible if you have good nails. Anyway, you'll need to do that twice a year. After buying this one, I've bought another one in different color."
2,"Alas, farewell!","My third try with this timer just failed, as usual it was the digital readout, which started displaying partial, thus illegible, numbers.I kept buying and trying this thing because in all other respects it is close to perfect. Still, three failures can be no accident, just sloppy quality control."
5,DOES THE JOB!,Easy to set up and use.Large numbers- easy to read from a distance.Different function buttons are different colors.Can use light or sound or both.Easy for children to use as well as befuddled adults.Timer beep is LOUD- I am able to work in the garden while timer is inside and I can still hear it.Magnetic backing is great- (just wish it had something on the back to hang it on a nail or hook).Timer does the job = ease of mind.
1,No sound,"I received the timer yesterday, and was able to get timer to work using the instructions. Howeverthere was no sound, and I couldn't find anything in the instructions to correct that. I don't think that it will beof much use without the sound."
3,Missing an option,"With this timer I'm surprised you can turn the light feature on/off but not the sound. With a visual indicator, it's rather obvious that some might prefer to see the timer instead of always hear it but Polder missed the opportunity here. The display is large but numbers become a little hard to read when the backlight is illuminated--it turns Green when the last minute is counting down, then Orange for the last 30 seconds, and swtiches red to the last ten seconds before cycling colors when the time is up.My favorite digital kitchen timer used to be made by Polder but now I see it's called General Tools TI150 3-in-1 Timer for the Visually and Hearing Impaired"" on this site. It has a choice of: vibrate, light, or beep (and any combination of them) for a more discreete or useful timer."
2,Garbage,"Cool idea but it just didn't work very well. The ""traffic light"" feature is tied to 1 minute which makes it mostly useless. If you have something in the oven that takes an hour, do you really care about the very last minute? Either adjustablility or a percentage based approach would have worked out much better.Since it didn't work in the kitchen, I decided to use it for workouts. It was actually great for this for a little while. Having an easy to see indicator that you are in the last minute is great for letting you know when to give it an all out effort. Unfortunately, the entire top row of display elements have stopped working making it a little awkward for timing anything. I changed the batteries and it didn't help so I can only assume a hardware problem. Not a good sign for something that just sat around for a few months."
3,Light effects are unintuitive,"It's easy to set, although for longer times it's tedious to press the ""minute"" button so many times.The alarm is of medium volume and carries on for a while.The way the lights work on this item aren't intuitive. With 1 minute remaining it turns GREEN. With 30 seconds remaining it turns ORANGE. With 10 seconds remaining it turns RED. When the time is up it cycles through all the colors as it rings.Personally, I think it should be green while it's timing, then turn ORANGE when 30% of the time is remaining, then turn red when 5 or 10% of the time is remaining.If you time 2 minutes it makes sense to turn orange at 30 seconds. But if you time 40, you still don't have a gradual winding down.Anyway, it's a neat item and seems to work relatively well, but the lights don't work the way I'd hoped."
2,Poor Quality,The digital display of my timer just stopped working after 6 months! Poor quality as mentioned in other reviews. I will have to move on to another brand.
3,works well but,"product was delivered promptly, works as described, have only one issue, can't figure out how to turn it off after use, have to take the batteries out and keep them near by, kind of a pain, should have an on & off.But like it and will continue to use it."
4,"Easy to set, big numbers, good price","I just got this item today and so far I like it. The good features are the large size of the digits, the fact that it's easy to set, and the price. I do think a couple things could be better: the feature for it to sit on a table-top at an angle is one of the reasons I purchased it, but it's not angled up enough to really see the digits without being on top of it. Still it's nice that you can set it on a table, or flip the piece down in the back and stick it to something with the magnet. The other thing that could be better are the lights that come on when there is a certain amount of time left on the timer- -while a nice feature, the only one you can see well is the green light that goes on when there is 1 minute left. The other two lights are harder to see. All-in-all a decent timer for the money."
4,can't turn it off ?,"great little timer, works well, but you can't turn it off, except by removing the 3 AAA batteries. The little on/off switch is only for the lights."
1,"great concept, low quality","This is my SECOND of these timers for the kitchen. I love the concept... but the first one died after 6 months... the time set buttons would no longer do anything. Thinking it was a fluke, I purchased a second... this one the seconds digits display stopped functioning after 4 months. Great idea, bad quality."
3,"Decent, but color change timing is unhelpful","Other reviewers have covered many of the good and bad points of this timer, and I don't need to repeat their words.However: I bought this timer because I wanted the visual countdown reminder that the colored LEDs provide. The whole timer changes colors as the time gets close to the end. I thought that would be valuable for times when I'm in another room but can see the timer in the background.However, the color change doesn't happen until 1 minute from the end: it goes green, then goes yellow with 30 seconds left, switching to red for the 10-second countdown. To me, that's not very helpful because it happens too quickly. I would have preferred a longer time frame--perhaps going green with 5 minutes remaining, yellow for 1 minute, red for 30 seconds.Given the short time frame, the color change feels more like a gimmick than a useful tool for my purposes."
3,Not Good for Using with Children,"I was wanting a timer that would automatically divide the time into 3 sections (ex. 12 minutes set time: 4 minutes of green, 4 minutes of yellow, and 4 minutes of red) so my 2 year old can visually see what category of time she has remaining. This timer does light up but it only lights up for the last 1 minute of whatever time frame you set it for. It is green from 1 min to 31 seconds, then goes orange from 30-11, and then is red for the last 10 seconds. Doesn't give my daughter much notice that she is running out of time and better speed up whatever she is doing.However, it seems to work and function in all other ways fine."
3,"Irksome, but fully functional","I recently had to replace my faithful old ""crank"" mechanical timer, and since the reviews of this type of product were very negative, I chose the Polder Traffic Light Kitchen Timer. The one I received is accurate, but it is a bit of a hassle to use. The time is set by repeatedly pressing the 1-minute button, which produces a rather jarring beep. Setting any time over 10 minutes is an incredibly repetitive task that is very hard on the ears. Other than that, the unit is useful."
5,Great Little Item,This little timer is easy to use plus it reminds you visibly and audibly. It is especially helpful in that it replaces watching the clock.
3,Alarm Should Be Louder...,"This is a very functional timer. The up and down timer is nice. The readout is large and clear. The ""Traffic Light"" alert system has limitations. A little tough on batteries if you use the light alarm system.The alarm tone is not loud enough if you are using this in a noisy environment or are working a fair distance away from it. Being advertised as a product for the hearing impaired, I expected the alarm to be much louder. Having the ""Traffic Light"" alert system is only useful if you are visually monitoring the timer...in which case you could do as well with a wrist watch or wall clock.Polder has great customer service. They sent me a replacement when I called to ask about the soft alarm. The replacement unit was just as quiet. :-("
3,"okay, but not great","I don't love my timer because you can't control the volume. It's pretty loud. Also, the smallest touch will alter the time. I have been using it to study for an exam that has timed sections. It makes carrying it in my bag close to impossible without it randomly going off."
1,Kitchen Timer,Haven't been able to use it because I can't get the cover off to insert the batteries. May have to send it back.
1,overpriced timer,I added this timer to my purchases because I needed one and hadn't really looked for one at the stores. I have since seen a virtually identical timer for about half of what this one cost.
4,his masterpiece,surprisngly well from a mediocre writer. very john le carre-like. lots of glimpses from childhood. dilemmas. investigation of a former friend. and the game called espionage and information. well carried out.
4,wonderful for a year,"I have 3 boys ages 5, 4, and 2. They are hard on strollers! We typically go through a stroller a year. We bought the maclaren with the hopes that it would last longer. It didn't, but it was wonderful while it lasted and we're replacing it with another maclaren! Customer service told us they would pay to ship it back, repair it, then send it back to us, all for free. We are not doing that because it will take too long (months) but the stoller is the best I've ever owned and we have put many miles and wear-and-tear on this stoller. I highly recommend it. Maybe no stroller is meant to last longer than a year with 3 rough-and-tumble boys!"
4,expensive but worth it,I bought this item as a gift for a friend who has a 2 yr old and a 2 month old daughter. It fits idealy in the trunk of her civic and is easily manageable for long trips. The girls love it and fit comfortably and safely in the stroller.
2,Expensive,"Considering that you can still buy covers from Nintendo directly for $1.00, it seems like a poor choice to order a generic version for 2.5x the price."
3,Still ended up with tape,"I bought this for my daughters gameboy. Her battery cover was broken and I thought we'd get this instead of putting tape over the cover. The first time I put it in, the little lever broke. It wasn't that expensive, and it was a cheaper plastic. We ended up just taping it anyway."
2,Defective Lacie 160 GB from Beach Camera,"I have received Lacie 160 GB rugged drive. But the product is defective. I have used it with my Mac OS X 10.5.2. First few times it properly mounts on my Macbook desktop. I have copied about 5 GB of vidio file. After that it doesn't mount. I can't use it anymore. I am going to return it. Beach Camer's return policy is not good. They will not refund 100%. Even for defective product they keep 10%. They will return only 90% of the product cost even for defective product, it surprises me.Careful before buying it from Beach Camera."
2,"Good, but not so good","When it worked, performance was outstanding. When it broke, I was left high and dry by LaCie. The machine was out of warranty, so repair by the Company was refused.As luck would have it, the device gave up the ghost two days after I retired and I had not had time to back-up to my home computer. In the meantime, the back-up on my previous work PC had been re-formatted.Data recovery from LaCie was also not not an option, however, their recommended source for data retrieval started at $500, minimum.LaCie was was nice enough to offer another device at a reducedprice:>(.....(Thanks for the great deal but no thanks).Lesson....back up importand data to more than one location, if possible, and let the buyer beware."
1,LaCie 160 GB,"it did not work. waiting for LaCie to call me, very disapointed. i just hope my system does not crash prior to saving it on a hard drive"
1,Good Rugged Drive but uses too many Ports,"I needed a small portable drive, so I bought this one. It works good but this drive is not for me. I have two problems with it and neither problem is clearly spelled out in the description.Its formated for the Mac --- I needed one that will work on both Mac & Windows. For a mac person this is complicated to make it work on Windows --- in addition to reformatting this drive, special software needs to be installed to make it work with windows.It must use two ports in order to operate: a USB port to supply power and another port (USB, Firewire 400, Firewire 800) for data.To make a long story short, I bought the 3 additional portable drives that I needed from WesternDigital --- their Passport drives are smaller, use only one USB port and work on both macs and windows right out of the box."
1,Buy a different drive,"The drive's performance via USB 2.0 for read and write is way below par for other drives in this price range.I've tested this drive on my Mac Book Pro and WIndows XP machines and on both platforms, the drive is much slower than my other external drives(G-Drive minis).It seems that the extra slow 5400 RPM hard drives in this enclosure causes a real performance hit.I have also experienced on multiple occassions, that the drive didn't actually successfuly copy files over. It would appear to copy but then nothing would appear on the drive.In the end, I would pick from another vendor.The cheap rubber thing also doesn't protect the drive. It just looks nice.Beyond that, this drive is junk."
1,They Don't Tell You That You May Have to Reformat This Drive,"I spent about an hour of my life I'll never get back trying to make this HDD work for my laptop with XP. You probably know the drill, plug it in this way, then that, reboot with it plugged in, and without, reboot while singing Christmas carols or facing west ....Only after I wrote LaCie tech support did I learn that this model is formatted for a Mac. Reformatting didn't take long, once they sent me the instructions. Nowhere on the website or setup did they say this. The LaCie support response was that they never claimed that it supported both Mac and PC.On the LaCie website they tell potential buyers of this device you ""simply plug it into just about any computer anywhere..."" except something as exotic as one running XP.For customer service, I give LaCie an ""F"""
1,Beautiful equipment - impossible to use,"The LaCie was recommended by my local newspaper as the best possible unit for portability and dependability for computer backup. It is a beautiful unit and I'm sure it is all they say it is. It arrived missing the cable I needed and the instructions are only for advanced computer users. I have no idea how to use it. The support is minimal and I now have a $200 paper weight. I could return it but that would be unfair to the retailer who sold it to me - they were great. If you are a computer genius this is for you! If you really want to back up your computer, get Nero and dump on to DVDs - it's easier and less stressful; not to mention a whole lot cheaper - TWO THUMBS DOWN LaCie!LaCie 160 GB Rugged Hard Drive USB 2.0/FireWire400/FireWire800 8MB Cache"
1,rating is for amazon's quoting inflated price,"i just left LaCie's booth at MacWorld Expo computer show, and the drive lists for $249, not $508, MSRP. so the $255 amazon price exceeds the MSRP and the quoted savings don't exist. It's a pricing error, I'm sure, but unfortunate, as the drive specs are great and i'll be getting one. Just not from amazon this time.The drive earns five stars."
4,Works as advertised,"I have had this drive for about one year. It works exactly as advertised, plug and play. No muss no fuss- plug in a SINGLE USB or FW cable (other reviews are wrong about multiple wires) and you have an extra 160 GB. I have dropped it and fallen off my bike with it in my messenger bag. I went to the doctor but it didn't. It is formatted for MAC. If you run windoz you will need to figure out how to reformat it. That should take about 10 min. There are probably faster drives around, BUT... it is easy to find in the dark and you won't drop it in the shower due to its slippery case! It is one of my most reliable least demanding electronic products. (One star off because nothing is perfect- aren't you happy you are not my student.)"
4,Good Product,I bought this item to record video onto directly from a Sony HD camera. I have been very pleased with it's speed and ability to keep up with the high volume of data being pushed to it from the camera.
2,Great until it malfunctioned...,"I bought the drive at the end of January, come the beginning of May it full on broke. Before that, it was great. 160GB, highly reliable and very portable. However one morning I plugged it into my Macbook and it wasn't recognised. I tried a different Mac and different firewire cable but came up with nothing. Next step, I called Lacie. After 30mins of being kept on hold I spoke to an adviser who unhelpfully concluded that the hard drive needed repair after a long session of 'let's try this'. Lacie have agreed to repair the drive as it is still under warranty but I they cannot retrive any of the data on the drive itself. So if you are looking for a reliable portable external hard drive I recommend you look elsewhere as this one is not worth the money, for the drive to function less than 4 months of occasional use is not really acceptable."
4,On everyone's bookshelter,"The complex social, technical and artistic problems of house design in the 20th Century it's the aim of this wonderful volume. Original drawings presented together with brand new photographs reveal exactly to what extent the initial vision has endured. Besides the best known masterpieces, several ones less known are included. This volume deserves a good spot on everyone's bookshelter."
4,The newest album,"Pretty much when you buy a queer's album you pretty much know what your getting into. It sound just like their previous album 2002 Pleasant Screams. Basically it has 13 2 1/2 minute ramones sounding pop-punk songs. All 13 songs sound exactlly the same. Which is not a bad thing. That is why I pretty much like all their albums.The best two songs on this records are ""Houston we Have a problem"" and ""think she's starting to like me"".The greatest thing now is that Asian Man records is reissueing all their lookout record releases. That totally awsome. I just bought ""Beat off"", ""Move Back Home"" and ""Grow up"". Since lookout went out business.Are the queers my favorite pop punk band ? Probally, I like the first two Greenday records and almost all of the Screaching Weasel records and Squirtgun and The Riverdales.Lookout I think the best collection of Pop punks bands.So If you heard any other queers album and liked you'll definately enjoy this CD."
2,The Queers are here?,"Yawn. This is the best word to describe this CD. This is coming from a huge Queers fan. Don't Back Down was the last GREAT album the Queers did. PRC was OK and probably should have been the last. This album is just kinda boring. Maybe I'm getting old, maybe Joe is too. This album just doesn't grab you and shake you like it should. It's not terrible, just blah. I expected more."
1,Not exactly what I ordered,"These are not white, they're actually more like ivory. I was wanting ivory but they were out of stock so I ordered white, so I am actually happy with the color, although I could imagine someone actaully wanting white could be upset about it. They were a little wrinkly as cotton usually is but smoothed out fine once I put them on the bed. They have a nice quality feel to them. My husbands one complaint was that they were a little too warm.-TammyAdditional comment:I wrote the review for these soon after I got them and gave four stars, but I felt compelled to edit my review because they quickly became ""nubby"", which I did not expect from sheets that were egyption cotton with 400 thread count. Now they feel like sandpaper."
2,Not good quality,"I followed the instructions carefully, washed only in cold water, tumble dry extra low, etc. but these sheets still shrank. Also terrible pilling after only a few months. I do not recommend. The sheets were wrinkly, but I could live with that, but not the pilling, which makes them uncomfortable to sleep on."
2,did not fit well,"They were advertised as having deep pockets but found it almost impossible to get the bottom sheet on my queen size mattress-almost sprained a finger getting the last corner on. This was after only one washing in cold water. Smoothness was o.k., but too much work getting them on the mattress."
3,"Not sateen, colors wrong","I got two sets, sky blue and mauve, one for me and one for my mother. There doesn't seem to be an improvement over our Ashley 350 count sheets, and, frankly, though this says sateen, it is still rough. It's not like sand or wool, but you feel a thread texture when you touch it. If I am getting high end sheets, I at least want softness, and, if they say sateen, I expect the very smooth, glossy finish that I have experienced on other luxury sheet brands in department stores. This does not have that. Put these sateen sheets next to regular sheets and you cannot feel a difference.Further, my sky blue had a pink tinge to it such that it appeared the same hue of pink-lavender as the mauve I purchased. I've seen other complaints like this.This was the first thing I have ever sent back to Amazon. It wasn't wildly defective, but there was no reason to keep them."
1,Pockets not deep enough,"I purchased these sheets for a mattress that is 15"" high Sterns and Foster Mattress and it does not fit the mattress very well at all. There are 2 corners on one end that it is about 2 inches from the bottom. I am not happy with my purchase and I doubt about the 18"" pockets if that is accurate."
2,All that glitters...,"is not gold! They feel ok but I have not even washed them and they are wrinkled. The hems are not sewn well particularly the pillows so they look cheap. The sheets are big and will fit pillow top matresses well. The colour is beautiful though and they feel strong, I am just worried about how they will look after I wash them! I think the prices posted as the original prices are not accurate. As the consumer we are being made to believe that they are really high quality until we get the package!"
2,wrinkles galore,They feel great but unless you have someone to iron them prepare to sleep on nothing but wrinkles....Hope it gets better as time goes on.
3,"Elegance 400-Thread-Count Egyptian Cotton Sheets, King","We prefer a more finished or polished sheet set so I wouldn't describe these as ""elegance"". They are a bargain and they are definitely not sateen. They look as though they need to be ironed to look finished."
5,TK's Testifies,"I will real please with the price,product and store from where this product was purchased"
1,Not so elegant sheets,"After only one usage and washing pilling of the material made reusing them uncomfortable. When I tried to return them I was refued because 30 days had expired. We hadn't used them until then. I have a balance in my account to use. Other than that we will not be buying from Amazon anymore. Imagine if we were to buy early gifts for someone which had been in our plans. Also, I have since read other complaints of the product with similar responses, yet you still sell them."
1,Worst sheet set I ever purchased!,"I have purchased many sheet sets from Amazon and have always been very pleased. This set, however, is the biggest disappointment ever. Not only do they not feel like sateen, but they ""pilled"" terribly under me after just one night. 400TC should never do this! What a waste of money.They now sit in my closet. I don't want to put them back on my bed, doing so would feel like I was punishing myself. I purchase up to 1200TC to reward myself! With the excessive pilling, I wouldn't even want these if I got them for free. DON'T PURCHASE THESE SHEETS!"
1,Crime scene sheets?,"The sheets appeared to arrive in good order, and were wrapped and presented for Christmas this year (2007). The new owners called me, however, AFTER washing the sheets initially (always recommended), and told me there appeared to be ""blood on them"". Now I know I got good deal on them, but did they wash away the evidence from a crime scene? I wanted to send them back, but was told they would ""manage to make do"" with them. I feel horrible, having given discounted ""blood stained"" sheets to my very good friends... I should have paid full price for unsoiled ones..."
1,Elegance 400 TC Egyptian Sateen Queen Sheet Set,"I was disappointed in this product after laundering it. It lost the ""sateen"" look and all items needed to be ironed in order for them to look decent enough to use again. Having to iron an entire sheet set is ridiculous!"
1,Poorly made,I purchased these sheets for my daughter in law for Christmas. She washed them as directed and went to put them on her bed. Each corner on the fitted sheet the threads were pulling out. Very poorly made!
1,Waste of $20,"Feels nice fresh from the package, despite the loose threads (poor-quality sewing I'm sure). After 3 washings, they are starting to pill. They have also shrunk, and fitting them on the bed is now a very tight squeeze. Definitely not 400TC, and definitely not Egyptian cotton."
