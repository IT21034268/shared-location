5,fantastic christmas recording!,This recording is such an uplifting selection and beautifully performed set of traditional Christmas music. We just love listening to it every Christmas.Thank you Choral Arts Society and Norman Scribner!
5,One of the All-Time Jazz Classics,"This album is one of the all-time jazz classics and makes it onto just about every ""best jazz albums"" list. Miles Davis plays on Adderly's album and his influence shows. Very, very nice to listen to. By the way, Adderly played on the legendary ""Kind Of Blue"" album, the best selling jazz album ever."
5,A great listening experience!,"This is brilliant stuff. As an album it's up there with Kinda Blue. But the one song that you have to buy ""Somethin' else"" for is 'Autumn Leaves'. One of the best songs I've ever heard."
5,"Consider it a Miles Davis ""Kind of Blue"" prequel","Recorded in 1958, one year before the legendary 'Kind of Blue' session, this performance is dominated by Miles Davis, and Davis' cool, modal influence. The droll, conversational tone is evident throughout, even on the ""hotter"" tracks. The sound is pure Miles Davis Quintet, even though Miles and Cannonball are playing with Hank Jones (who does the usual superb, tasteful job accompanying), Art Blakey (excellent, but restrained) and Sam Jones (solid). Cannonball is wonderful, but is somewhat corraled here with Miles running the show. For those of you who love the Davis sound, this is a fine session, but ""Them Dirty Blues"" is closer to the ""real"" Cannonball."
1,RVG is destroying great jazz masterpieces,"This is a MONO recording ! UPC 2434953292 shows EMI Music Distribution recording mode as STEREO which may actually be the case, however this RVG Edition is remastered in MONO and not a very good one. Presents a narrow sound stage with instruments on top of one another. I have some very well mastered ""MONO"" recordings but this is not one of them.Clearly feel cheated on this one, as I have to buy the original Blue Note release.Please do not buy into the hype about 24 bit analog to digital transfer because the results are borderline amateurish, like someone was messing around with their laptop software.This is not the only landmark recording RVG has ruined. Kenny Burrell's ""Midnight Blue"" is another one to be avoided."
4,"Not the best but, hey, it's Cannonball!","My experience with Cannonbal was mostly through Miles Davis a couple of other CD's, (Cannonball and Coltrane), (Nippon Soul). This CD is not on the same level as those other two works but still a worhty listen. I recommend the former 2 if not in your collection or if you want a better taste of his amazing talent. Get this one to complete your library."
5,Wonderful,"A great disc by a great collection of musicians. Cannonball often takes a side role-even as a leader-to the playing of others, specifically Miles Davis, yet the album has a warmth and atmosphere that are fully his. 'Autumn Leaves' is a stunner-beautiful and long with great solo work by all. 'Love for sale' is also very catchy-you will probably recognize the melody when you hear it. I think the last track is supposed to be called 'Rangoon' but I'm not positive-it is 'Bangoon' on the back of the jewel case. A great introduction to Adderley's work. Highly Recommended."
1,"good music, bad transfer","4 stars for the music: it sounds like Davis' first quintet on the Prestige label - very good but not great. The reason for the single star is the 1998 transfer is awful: the treble is boosted far too high, with the result that Davis (and sometimes Adderley, too) sounds shrill above the stave, and the piano accompaniment is lost in the background. I suspect RVG was trying to give Miles the ""Blue Note sound"", but Miles isn't Lee Morgan (and I love Lee) and doesn't fit the mold. He's too introspective, his sound more diffuse than bright.Blue Note needs to remaster this title to restore Miles to his rightful self."
2,"Good picture, pity about the bulb!","Quite happy with with the quality of the picture. My bulb lasted 370 hours. Disappointing for an item that claims a bulb life of 2000-3000 hours! Tech support is fairly open about the nature (...): bulbs start to grow dim at about 300 hours, dying well before their box specs; replacement lamps average (...). Someday some bright soul on the internet will find a way to replace the mercury vapor bulb within the lamp for a few dollars, rather than the whole lamp for a few hundred, but until then I would urge buyers to avoid this knockoff of the higher-quality, name-brand DLP projectors. Alas, I have learned the hard way that you get what you pay for."
1,BenQ support,"We purchased a BenQ PB 6100. If the overall quality of the projector is fine, such is not the case of the lamp which blew up in less than 6 weeks!!! and worse BenQ does NOT honor their international guarantee and the support center does not respond to the emails for exchanging the lamp (priced 400$!). Overall a very poor support. My last Boxlight lamp is still running after 4 years. This was my first BenQ but surely the last. A strong suggestion, Don't buy BenQ."
1,This BenQ PB6200 DLP Video Projector is not good,"I purchased this BenQ PB6200 DLP Video Projector. What I saw did not worth my dime. They took the BenQ PB6200 DLP Video Projector from the attic with a spider web in the machine, put the machine in the box without the electric capble."
1,You are now warned!,"Word of Warning. I purchased a BenQ projector and had it for a month before it started to fail and turn itself off. I sent it to BenQ for repair and have not recieved it back. That was over two months ago. I phone them every couple of days and get only lip service, they keep saying it is coming. So before you purchase a BenQ product think about the possibility of it getting repaired...or should I say never seeing it again.You have been warned!"
4,Many stories in a book is a good thing,"This book is a starter book for many authors, but will entertain even the most remote reader. I think you will find at least one you love,and many that you like, and none to be unremarkable."
3,Movie Star Homes,"If you want glossy pictures, this is not for you. If you want short background information and black and white, this book is for you. I was disappointed because of the size of the photos, but I did enjoy the short reads."
3,Hollywood Homes,"Very interesting although the pictures are small and in most cases you only get a photo of the 'front gate'. I learned a lot. Overall, very good."
4,STAR HOMES,"This book is a guilty pleasure, really a fun read. I appreciated that every entry came with a requisite image. Granted most of the entries are star's from yesteryear, many of which i dont have a clue about, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book nonetheless. If you have any interest in this sort of thing, then I highly recommend it."
3,"umm,ok..........","I kind of got confused with Ms. Lincoln's fusing of stories. I did enjoy the lanuguage and poetry behind her writing. She definately has a gift when it comes to description, and styling.Where I was lost, however, was the link between the stories. some seemed to matter to others, some did not. What was the importance of the story involving Boag and his parents, or Pontella if we did not get to hear more about her attack. I need to sit down and talk to the author."
5,Great Wardrobe Piece!,"I have experience in retail, so I know what I'm talking about when I say that this is a flattering and feminine-fun piece to add to your wardrobe! Choc/Pink is always a good combo!"
3,Too clingy,"This top looks ok except the material is too clingy. It accentuates every ""curve"" you may want to hide. It will look good if you have a good figure."
2,Billy Connolly Live at Odeon Hammersmith,"I have seen better from Billy Connolly on TV, where his physical antics are part of the show. Very difficult for an American listener to understanding what he is saying on this recording, and the humor is slow in coming, with a lot of allusions that escaped me. Apologies to all the fans of Billy out there, but I would give this a pass."
4,Excellent flavor from this company,"We have now tried three varieties (cinnamon stick w/cinnamon, pumpkin spice &crem brulee) of these beans and each was very nice. Would highly recommend this brand and seller."
5,Best book I have read so far!,"If you take the time to read the many suggestions and easy-to-understand principles the author writes about, you will find so many pet ailments making so much more sense. Our pet is now 10 times healthier than before, thanks to this woman's wealth of insights and experience. Thank you!"
3,This book is really meant for dog owners.,"I ordered this book because I have two cats and I am interested in herbal healthcare and alternative healthcare for them. I liked this book, but was disappointed in the cat section, which was only a couple of pages. If I owned a dog, I would be delighted by this book. However, as a cat owner, I want a book written specifically for cats."
3,the complete herbal handbook for the dog and cat,good background book but those reading must remember some of the info is very out of date - terrific read otherwise!
1,There is a lot of folk lore and very little science.,"The author relies on her own experiences and anecdotes from other pet owners. There is very little if any scientific evidence to back up her claims. Some of her criticisms of conventional veterinary care are very out dated, and she seems unaware of recent developments and improvements in vet technology and treatments. If people believe her claims that vaccines are not effective, then their pets' health may well suffer."
3,Where have all the flowers gone???,"I have recently purchased several gardenia fragrances and only one of them came close to smelling like a real gardenia to me. This one is NOT that one!! It was a rather pleasant scent but not memorable and if I had sampled it in a store I would not have purchased it. I liked that it was an oil base which made it a little longer lasting but I am looking for the old Tuvache Jungle Gardenia-type fragrance and this did not measure up. Also, when I uncapped it the bottleneck top was chipped. The best thing about this purchase was it came in a cute little bottle. I am also looking for a true rose fragrance and haven't found that yet either. In future I will shop for perfumeor cologne at the mall, try on some samples and then compare prices on the web for any that really interest me."
5,Terranova Gardenia,"I have decided this perfume is one of the most enjoyable fragrances I have ever had. I ordered it looking for a nice gardenia experience and this is it. Every single time I wear it (which is every day) I get compliments. A little bit goes a long way so you don't have to bathe in it but can get a nice uplifting effect with just a few drops. I love this product and hope it NEVER goes away. Thanks, Amazon."
3,Terranova Gardenia Pefume Essence,I bought a little bottle because I read some reviews and decided to try it since I love Gardenia. This was not as close to a real gardenia as I had hoped and gave it 3 stars.
2,A better book is available,"If you're seeking a brief, readable book that discusses what contemporary psychology and biology has to say about happiness, you would do well to pass over Layard and pick up Daniel Nettle's Happiness: The Science Behind your Smile. They cover similar territory, but Nettle packs more information into fewer pages and conveys it with far greater precision."
3,Shouldn't this be in Humor?,"Although I enjoyed this book, trying to play this of as scientific is laughable at best. There were places I just had to shake my head and think ""is he serious""?Read it to enjoy theories on happiness. Perhaps, even, to put some perspective on today's commercialized society. But, don't think you'll get any persuasive facts. The research is, well, not research."
1,A Deeply Flawed Work,"Layard gives a superficial overview of some economic and psycological research. He uses this research to advocate governmental management of happiness, which is the primary theme of the book. Whether or not you agree with that idea, this book's flawed logic and rambiling prose is unilkley to convince anyone either way.Layard proposes several policies intended to increase happiness including prohibition of vice, increased taxation, redistribution of wealth, and general intervention in the economy. Naturally, his authoritarian proposals for collective happiness largley ignore individual rights and freedom. They also ignore the fact that similar policies have failed when attempted by governments throughout history.What is clear is that if the department of happiness comes to be, the central planner's idea of happiness won't be mine, and it won't be yours either."
2,A clouded affair.,"I would like to say that I tore through this book at a rate of knots and left fully satisfied. I hate to discover that halfway through a book it is becoming a chore to read but that is exactly how I found this book. Although it does have moments that will no doubt allow you leave to pause for thought, generally it is a tough read that the author has obviously tried hard to complicate regarding issues where motives were actually very simple. Maybe he was looking to read between the lines for deeper issues but I don't believe that they existed. If this were a school report card it would have ""could do better"" written all over it. Frustrating."
5,Need this!,It is part of the safety equipment that is needed when you are going in the gulf. Folds in to a tight bundle in the safety kit.
1,What is the tape for???,"I purchased this flag for use in my boat. It is one of the Coast Guard requirements for operating a boat. I purchased a large square piece of oak to attach the flag to since it does not come with any way to display it.As soon as I opened the bag and unfolded the flag, I noticed 4 large pieces of white, reinforced tape, one at each corner, extending 6"" into the flag, installed underneath the grommets.First, I see NO reason for the tape to be there. It is not holding anything and does nothing. I was unable to remove the tape because the grommets had been installed over the tape.This tape looks REALLY tacky. Please look at product picture very closely. I have returned the flag for a refund."
5,Loved it loved it loved it!!,"I think Nick Wise did an excellent job on the book. He really knows how to give a reader what they want. I read this before I was a true fan-atic, and I learned a lot of stuff I never knew. I have another book on them written by some other dude, and it does not even compare!!! Pumpkin pride 4 life...trulio!"
3,Not Bad,"The book could use a little more in-depth information. Most of us die-hard fans know most of the material in it already and don't want to hear about the Gish remaster yet again. There is not enough text for the money, it is mostly pictures of the Smashing Pumpkins. Yes, they may be rare, but we are looking for information, not Billy in the SuperS*ut shirt again. Thanx for listening.."
4,a very informative book on the smashing pumpkins EARLY years,"I bought this book when i was first getting into the pumpkins so I learned alot of stuff i never knew.I even used it as a source for a report I did on the pumpkins in school (for which i recieved an A+)However...I have been searching the world over for a more a recent bio of the bitchingest band in the world. Maybe I should do it..Oh and before I go, I think Billy is the most beautiful thing in the universe and I WILL marry him.Love, Lauren*"
2,A not so concise history of Chicago's greatest rock band.,"Nick Wise, a writer with the British rock magazine Kerrang,attempts to get into the heart of the rock group, SmashingPumpkins. The book offers many never before seen picturesand the story of the band from their beginnings, to thetriumph of their 6 million selling cd Mellon Collie and theInfinite Sadness. The book gives a fair attempt at tellingthe band's story, but Wise's interjections are too often,and leave the reader wondering if it's a biography or asynopsis of alternative rock. As one of the biggest rockbands in the world today, the Pumpkins deserve a more in-depth study of their music, and the chemistry between theband. This book offers a good beginning, but leaves fansclamoring for more."
4,The Smashing Pumpkins are the best rock band in history.,"Billy Corgan is so *amazing*. When I listen to the truth and power behind his music I *tingle* and dance, no matter where I am. The book had some lovely pictures of the man I love, and I hope that new info and pictures will always pop up. I love you Billy, where ever you are. Love, Honey"
3,Take it for what it is.,"It was written in 1994, so I don't know why everyone is saying it leaves out so much info. By the time it was published they'd only had 2 albums. I do hope that someone writes a real biography of this band. They are one of my favorites and they were very important to the 90's alternative scene. For what the book is, a bunch of pictures and mediocre info, it gets 3 stars. Nick has written similar books about other bands. If you find it used, get it, otherwise don't worry about it being out of print."
1,Well...,"Actually I reviewed this book after I bought it, but the review never appeared. Maybe it was too cutting, or maybe it sounded like I was against the author too much. Anyway, only because there aren`t many books available on the Smashing Pumpkins, is this book worth buying. If you have a few spare bucks and you want to know the basics about the band, sure buy the book. I didn`t know some basics, so that`s why I bought it, but you could probably get the basics from good radio programmes like those on CFNY in Toronto. It also has some pictures that you may have not seen before. It`s too bad that someone hasn`t written a proper book about the band. Well, I`m busy, so I guess I can`t. There`s not much to do other than wait. But, then again, isn`t it nice to keep our myths and idols less analyzed sometimes? Just don`t think that this book is authoritive, that`s all."
4,Not a complete Biography,"This book is great for people looking for lots of info about the early years of the pumpkins and pictures. However, the author wrote little about siamese dream and mellon collie. If you started listening to the band during the siamese dream time, then this is a great book for you to review. Otherwise, if the author would have written a more complete story about the later years it would have been much better"
2,dusty?,"I was excited to get the watch because movado is one of my favorite companies. It came quickly but when I opened it up the face under the crystal wasn't completely clear, there was dust all over the pitch black face, and it is all too noticeable. Besides that, it is a great ""movado"" copy. If it wasn't for the dust I would have most likely have given it a 4 or 5."
4,Freeform  - Outside In,"Freeform's second album on Skam, OUTSIDE IN, starts off with the guitar sample of ""Wild Stew."" Is Simon Pyke going all bucolic on us? The funky wobble and icy ambience of ""Taking Me Over"" could point either way, but the steady techno beats and moody atmosphere on ""Follow Your Shadow"" (""Don't Wait Up"" is equally as dark) makes it clear: the good old Freeform has new tricks up his sleeve. ""Walk"" gets us back into more melodic territory, and ""Eating Weather"" into exotica. ""Carnival"" goes even further, with a btacuda barrage to accompany its bouncy tune. Meanwhle, ""Puzzle"" heads back into a chaos that sometimes mars Pyke's work, but he keeps it mostly in check here, especially as the delicate ""Everything Changes"" immediately follows. And the final track, ""Wonderplucks"" gets us back into the bucolic feel that opened the album. Freeform has surely put everything from outside in this album."
4,The best Judith and Renie book yet.,"In this mystery Judith and Renie take a murder mystery tour of their neighborhood. It is no surprise to the reader that Judith's bed and breakfast is featured, but Judith is furious at the lurid description of her home and rushes to confront the tour operator at the next stop. She follows him upstairs to the second floor of an historic apartment complex and finds the featured entertainment, an exorcist, dead of a gunshot wound.This is a fast moving and entertaining mystery, the characters are very quirky, and there are red herrings aplenty. I find myself looking forward to the next one."
3,A Streetcar Named Expire,"This is an entertaining book in the ""gifted amateur detective"" genre. It lags in spots with undue detail to the cousins' foibles but in general is a good read."
2,couch caddy,"The concept is nice but the side flaps seem too long, and top of unit may be too narrow for many sofa arms. I tucked one side and top of unit under cushion of couch to try and get more use from it. I wish I purchased something with a more simple design (like the original designs from the old days) which you can't find anymore in stores."
3,It's OK for some things,"This is OK for holding the remote, glasses, and things like that, but I would not use the top for any liquids or food."
4,NICE QUALITY,"I read a few reviews on another item from this same company that it takes a long time to get your order. I received mine in 4 days with no problems. Packaging was exceptional, color was good, pockets were made and secured well. This will be a NICE gift for my son-in-law."
1,Not Happy,"After receiving it, I put it back in the box and off to the garage. Very big and bulky, did not hold my remotes well"
2,Chair pockets,"Not satisfactory for either chair we have. Removed the ""table"" portion and it fits the arms OK."
4,FUNCTIONAL,"IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS FUNCTIONAL, BUT IF YOUR CHAIR IS A RECLINER OR A ROCKER IT WILL FALL SO IT WOULD BE BEST ON A STATIONARY ARM CHAIR, SO WE HANG ON A SMALL TABLE NEXT TO THE BIG MANS CHAIR!"
2,Not as nice as I thought!,Not as big and sturdy as I had hoped. Not sturdy enough to hold a drink on the top tray.
3,not for me,did not fit and returned product. I made this mistake of not planning well on this product and to return it.
2,"I returned it,",It is very light weight. There was nothing in the bean bag zipper pocket to help stablize it. The wires in the hanging pockets did nothing to help keep it on the armrest.
5,An organizer for people on the go,"The reason I say it is for people on the go is because of the versatility of the product. It keeps everything handy, organized, and fixed in a sturdy position. It will fit over most all sofa arms, and some recliner's. But most of all it is great for small relaxing times in the rec room, living room or bedroom. It will keep your ""glasses"" which I am forever forgetting where I put them, remote control, note pad, pens, etc."
3,SOFA ARM CADDY,"THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL IF YOU HAVE A FLAT ARM, BUT IF IT IS ROUNDED IT DOESN'T WANT TO STAY IN PLACE."
1,What a mistake,"It took forever for this package to arrive and then even though it was labeled as the the caddy we ordered, I have no idea what it is, but it certainly isn't the product we ordered. Stay away from these folks they don't know what they're doing!"
2,Could not get it to stay put,We're always losing our remotes in the sofa so I thought this would be a great solution. It was always falling off. Would recommend something else.
3,Not as good as the black leather type.,"I bought two different types, one for each chair. This one is not as capable to hold it's place as the pockets are wrinkled and stick out from the chair, and it doesn't stay fit against the chair."
4,Over Arm Caddy,I purchased this item for my husband for Christmas and it is just what he needed to hold all his things. It stays put on the arm very well
3,Cute,I could not resist this little jumper as a baby gift for my new little niece. I figure it will fit her around the holidays and will be adorable on her. My only negative is that I find the blouse Onezee to be made of seemingly poor quality material and the white of the lace collar did not quite match the white of the sleeves.
4,Long and somewhat confusing,"This book is probably one of the best books I've ever read. It gives you a glimpse into how people in that time talked, and how they looked at the world. I'll admit that at some points it was slightly confusing, like with the ""Strophes"" coming into the story and talking every once in a while, but in all, I think that if you get into the story you'll find it very intersting."
5,Great Plays - Great Translations,"First of all, I must say that this is the only translation of the Oedipus cycle that I have read. However, I have read translations of other Greek epics and plays in popular editions, and have found this to be the most readable of them by far.The plays of the Oedipus cycle have been central to western literature ever since Aristotle based his theory of poetics upon Oedipus Tyrannus. The plots of the plays are quite well structured. Of course, if you don't like tragedy, you probably won't like this book either."
4,A true classic,"Rereading - and teaching - ""Oedipus Rex"" as an adult was an interesting experience. While I am always a bit wary of translations, the text itself (as translated by Robert Fitzgerald) is rich with literary devices, and the use of foreshadowing is especially poignant. Sophocles adeptly leads his audience through a series of emotions, guiding responses and perceptions with ease. One characteristic of the play that I found most thought-provoking was the removal of violence. While I'm sure this was done in part to accommodate the logistics of the ancient Greek stage (how would you show someone hanging, for example), I can't help but feel it was also done in order to allow the audience to focus on the emotionally-charged consequences as opposed to the gore that is Oedipus' fate. A wonderful work."
5,Ivs Aluminim Coat/hat Hook,"Hooks arrived individually packaged with the proper screws for mounting. I bought these to make my own coat rack to fit a custom sized space in our closet. These hooks are very strong and the family hangs just about anything and everything from them (book bags loaded with books, stroller, nephews bowling ball and bag etc) and these things have no problem holding it all! A really well made product at a fraction of the cost of finding something similar in the stores. Buy your own piece of wood and sand / stain it and you can have a sturdy, perfectly matched coat rack for your home for a great price!"
4,Best guidebook for beaching in Thailand,"Just like its siblings this lonely planet book saved me over 100 times its cover price for my vacation. It does include an abbreviated Bangkok section as well as thorough, encyclopedic information about coastal Thailand. If you wish to plan a beach vacation in Thailand this is the best book you can buy. While it lacks unnecessary glossy photos a la Conde Nast, it is chock full of useful advice. My 1/2 star deduction is because I wish the authors would emphasize how incomplete your vacation will be if you eat every meal in the resort restaurants, and shop only in gift shops. That is a minor complaint, and I simply will not travel without a relevant lonely planet in my carry on bag."
5,Excellent basic cookbook!,Want to know how to make the best gravy or the greatest hot fudge sauce or how long to cook a prime rib roast? This is your cookbook for all of that and much more. I took my Mother's GH Cookbook with me when I got married over 44 years ago. It has been my main source of cooking information. Recently bought one for our son as he and his family have grown to enjoy it also.
2,cookbook,"I bought this book for my daughter who lives in another state. I thoughtit was published around 1974, but it was much older. She did not likeit as she said it was very sexist and the recipes old fashion."
2,not as promised condt,was in bad contd not as promised or advertisedask seller to resolve he finally answered to send him the book back at my cost for him then to give me back my moneyDID not trust seller to keep his word
2,Ditzy Heroine Turned Me Off,"I've read many of Julia Quinn's books, and generally enjoy her humorous style. Unfortunately, the heroine in this book is an overly naive, clutzy ditz unable to engage in witty repartee with the hero. This could be a cute premise, and I clung to the end, hoping for something that would make me feel like I had not wasted a day in my life, but alas it was not to be found. The story was also awfully predictable, even as romance novels go.Two stars awarded only because it's Julia Quinn. Skip it, and read her other books."
3,James? Is That You?,"This book was much better than TO CATCH AN HEIRESS. It was a simple story about an elderly woman who secretly plays matchmaker between two of her favorite people; her companion, Elizabeth, and her nephew, James.We have met James in TO CATCH AN HEIRESS, but if I didn't know any better I'd have thought it was a completely different character. I remembered James as rakish & mysterious, but in HOW TO MARRY A MARQUIS, his character lacked luster. Don't get me wrong, James was a great hero but I was expecting a more exciting story for him; thus the 3 star rating.It's a simple read you can breeze through in an afternoon. If you're a fan of Quinn's you'll enjoy it, however I recommend The Bridgerton Series above all."
1,"Boring,boring,boring......","I read this book based on recommendations from other readers and boy, was it bad!! Iam never buying or reading this author's books again - her attempts at humor just annoyed me and I thought the characters stupid and insipid. Much prefer Johanna Lindsay and Judith McNaught.Even the author's bio which made some attempts at humor managed to annoy me - I don't know - I just don't get why people like her books."
5,A Dreamy Romantic Read,"Author Julia Quinn does it again writing a terrific romancethat captures ones heart and imagination! I would also highlyrecommend""To Catch an Heiress"" by the same author. Keep writing Julia!!"
2,Disappointing,"I expected so much more. This is an okay book, just not a really good book. The conversations are irritating and don't seem real."
1,0 if I could....,"While I initially liked book, and Elizabeth sister's were fun, the last 100 pages were, well, awful. Elizabeth must marry well - she needs money. She finds a book in the library called ""How to Marry a Marquis"" and is embarrased to be caught with it when James, a real Marquis, arrives in the library. He does not tell her he is one, which I thought went on way to long for interest, but after admitting their feeling for each other, she is told of his rank by his friends, Blake and Caroline (from How to Marry a Heiress). Elizabeth than refuses to talk to James - for a 100 pages!!!!! James's friends were not friends at all and were busy buddies, really, and not very endearing. In the end, she should have realized her stubborness was rather drastic and apoligized, not the other way around. Why was no one trying to talk sense into Elizabeth? I was so disappointed to see the return of Caroline and Blake in such a shabby format."
1,What's all the fuss?,"I usually like Julia Quinn's work, but How to Marry a Marquis was a huge disappointment. To tell the truth, I couldn't even finish it. The basic problem was that the conflict between the romantic leads was unbelievable. One reviewer called her reaction to the revelation of his true identity ""psychotic"", and I think that's pretty close to the mark. Why she makes the assumptions she does and takes offense to the degree she does is beyond me. I just couldn't care about her hurt feelings; it seemed like junior high hysteria. I wanted to shake her and shout, ""Get over it!"" The only highpoint was his giving her boxing lessons and then discovering personally how well his pupil had learned to throw a punch."
3,Whimsical and enjoyable.,"A young, impoverished gentry woman embarks on a plan to marry well so that she may improve her siblings situation in life. Working as a companion she discovers her employer's book ""How To Marry A Marquis."" Taking heed of the book's advice, the heroine finds herself being led down a garden path filled with obstacles and finally, into the arms of Mr. Right. The story is standard fare except that it is told in such a highly engaging way. Ms. Quinn keeps the action going in a humorous and light hearted manner. A fun, entertaining read."
2,agree with sara from california. definitely an early work.,"i read _the viscount who loved me_ and the sun/moon books first, and i got this one. it's much less well developed than her later works. i could not perform the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" (something i always thought was reserved for latin american magical realism a la garcia marquez, but i digress) for these characters.i also had a HUGE issue with a technicality. in britain, the proper term is ""marquess"", not ""marquis"" (a french term). in addition to this, at some point in the book, the brother of an earl or the 2nd/3rd son of an earl, i forget which, is referred to as ""lord whatsis"". it's my understanding that only the 2nd-nth sons of dukes and (i believe) marquesses are styled ""lord firstname familyname"" (the eldest, of course, being the heir to the actual title). the 2nd-nth sons of earls and lower are ""the honourable mr. firstname familyname"". this really annoyed me."
3,"Funny, but could be better.","This book is a sequel of sorts to ""To Catch An Heiress"", but it stands alone very well. But while TCAH started out wonderfully and then sagged a little, HTMAM started out poorly but improved tremendously as the story progressed.The first chapter alone had me groaning, ""Children under 10 don't use big words like that!"" but along the way I began to adore Susan, the second oldest child. Lizzy started out a total emotional wreck, constantly wringing her hands and wondering what to do, but eventually I grew to like her.James may be a good ex-spy, but he sure doesn't act like one. But he's a nice guy through and through. He and Lizzy make one of the nicest couple ever - there's no long angst, no my-ex-is-so-evil subplots, just chuckles and smiles along the way.The first half gets two stars, the second half four, even that out and HTMAM gets three stars. If you want a nice easy way to past a Sunday afternoon, picking this up won't hurt."
2,How To Marry A Marquis Fizzles,How to Marry A Marquis has a promising title and little else. I was expecting a great story and interesting plot. The characters are mundane and staid. I was very disappointed in the entire story. After reading the first couple of chapters I kept expecting the suspense to build and it never did. The blackmail in the story never amounted to much and the only really interesting character was Lady Danbury. How to Marry A Marquis is a disappointment. This is only the second Julia Quinn story I have read and I have serious doubts about whether I will read another. The Duke and I was a much better book.
5,Such a good read!!!!!!!!!,"I love all JQ's novels but this one was really really good. Now I must go and get all of her books I have not had the chance to read yet. I love the plots,the characters,the loyalty and possesiveness of the characters, but most of all I love the humor!!! Even when my 2 sons look at me wierdly when I laugh out loud! I look for authors who put plenty of humor in the story. It only takes me 1 to 2 days to read JQ's books because I can't put them down. I started to love the historical romances after I read a Julia Garwood book, and then I found Jill Barnett. I almost gave up on finding any other author I liked so much until I came across a Julia Quinn novel. Now I've found a new favorite!! Bravo Julia Quinn, you've found yourself another fan!!"
5,What FUN!,"I loved this book. ""How to Marry a Marquis"" is a fun, sweet, and entertaining story. When Miss Elizabeth Hotchkiss sets out to find a husband, she comes across a ""manual"" on how to marry a Marquis in her employers' library. When James Sidwell, Marquis of Riverdale; posing as James Siddons, her employers' estate manager, offers to help her, it turns out to be a very interesting lesson in trust, love and accepting that fate plays a hand in all of us. You will absolutely love this book and won't be able to put it down. I would recommend that you also buy ""To Catch an Heiress"" which is the first book and the characters also play a part in ""How to Marry a Marquis"". Enjoy!"
2,Irritating,"While I enjoyed Ms. Quinn's light-hearted approach to her theme, and I found much of her humor witty and engaging, I did not like the book. I thought her fiesty heroine a complete cliche. I made my way through most of the book with no extreme quibbles, but I fairly itched with irritation when Elizabeth discovered James's true identity. Her indignation was irrational and went on and on ad insufferabiliam. Also, I wish someone would explain to Ms. Quinn and her copy editor the difference in usage between ""lie"" and ""lay."""
2,Merely Okay,"It's a common story line, done better before. A little disappointing when I considered the reviews that encouraged me to read this. Tried to hard to be meaningful. Don't buy - pick up at the library, if you must!!!"
4,Humorous,"I found this book entertaining to say the least. Not much of a plot but it was a cute story. The best thing about this book is that it made me laugh out loud several times. Lots of amusement and very snappy lines coming from this author. This is the first time I've read anything by Julia Quinn, but it probably won't be the last."
4,An usual path to true love!!!,"This book is full of fun and laughter!!It includes a scheming old aunt, nosey siblings, a prince in disguse, an obnoxious cat and and above all else a woman who looks for love the wrong way but ends up finding it where she least expects it!! This book is a must read!! Don't be the last!!"
2,Disappointing,"Typically, I enjoy a nice, simple Julia Quinn novel. How to Marry a Marquis, however, was a disappointment. The plot was nearly nonexistent and I found my attention wandering through much of the book, skipping ahead in a fruitless endeavor to find a part that was more interesting than the last. The ending, particularly Elizabeth's overdone fury over the Marquis's deception bordered on absurd. I find little to recommend this book save the fact that it is a regency romance with the typical happy ending. Save your money and choose another of Quinn's books."
3,Mixed feelings about this one,"While I loved the fact that Lady Danbury (the old, loud lady that appears in the Bridgerton series) has such a prominant role, there were a few too many irksome moments in this story. Quinn definitely gave the characters more depth, but at the same time, Elizabeth just seemed so obtuse and annoying at the end, that she practically changed into a whole other character. For example, she starts off wanting to do anything for her family, then when she learns the truth about James, she's too proud and practically too stupid. On the flipside, as a Bridgerton fan, I loved the appearance of Danbury, and she gave much more to the book. There were also many funny details and meaningful parts that made this story enjoyable. I wouldn't skip the book, but it wont be on my list of favorites."
3,another ok story,"liked the family side of the story and the interaction of the family members.the marquis and the heroines story was ok,but have read better love stories"
4,Good read,"It was a good book, I enjoyed reading this along with some of her other books. I love to read and this was worth reading."
2,Disappointing downer from a usually capable Quinn,"For years, Julia Quinn was the pinnacle of Regency romance writing for me, but now that I've discovered Eloisa James, I guess I'm holding Julia to a higher standard, and How To Marry A Marquis just doesn't cut it. Aside from Lady Danbury, and our old friends Blake and Caroline, none of the characters held my attention or were very absorbing; I just didn't want to keep reading (although I did), which is a first for any of Ms. Quinn's previous works, which I've devoured (I think I read all 8 books of the Bridgerton series in about 10 days!). I'd save your money and check this one out of the library, or borrow it from a friend."
2,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"I WAITED FOR THIS BOOK TO COME OUT. JAMES WAS GREAT IN TO CATCH AN HEIRESS. BUT HE JUST DIDNT DO THE TRICK IN TO MARRY A MARQUIS. IN FACT THE WHOLE TIME I READ THIS BOOK ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS JOHANNA LINDSEY'S MAN OF MY DREAMS,SO MUCH SO THAT I HAD TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN AND RE READ THAT ONE. JULIA QUINN IS ONE OF MY FAVIROTES BUT SOMETHING IS LOST IN THIS BOOK. I DONT KNOW IF IT IS THE STORY LINES SIMILARITY TO A MAN OF MY DREAMS. IN BOTH BOOKS THEY WANTED TO CATCH WEALTH TO PROVE SOMETHING. I JUST HOPE SUSAN GETS HER OWN STORY"
5,Elizabath and James are great &funny...,this is my thrid books by Julia Quinn...and this is a great one also....its amazing I love every single one of her books.... a must read book !
3,Average,"This book was very fun to read. The plot was not as well thought out as it should be, but nonetheless, it is a very ""cute"" story."
4,Fine,"Quick and The Undead was original. The story was a basic western story but with zombies thrown into the mix. I highly enjoyed this film and i'm surprised not more people like it. The dvd comes with a behind the scenes feature that is almost half an hour, which was a surprise. I recommend this to horror fans who like something different."
1,Quick and the Undead,"I am pretty sure, that, even tho I own this movie I will never watch it again - unless we have a really long extended cable,satelitte, antenna and video store blackout somehow"
3,Works well - Poor driver support,"I got this card for use with a Logitech v270 mouse. While it works, the Logitech software requires a higher driver version than Zoom can provide. I got this message from Zoom Tech Support:""At the present time, the latest build available for the Zoom PCMCIA Bluetooth adapter is 1.4.2.12. I do not have a definitive date for the release of a newer build for this software."""
1,Terrible Conclusions; Some Good Data,"Well-researched accident histories but a lousy selection of accident causes; terrible information (example: ""at night. . .oxygen concentration levels might be much lower than daytime""); and recommendations to turn the FAA into a police agency. Dwells on alcohol-related accidents, even though 1995 and 1996 accident statistics show only one (1) fatality and two accidents related to alcohol during the two years. The book places blame on the FAA, FBOs, ATC for not running a police state and blames everyone by the pilot. (Of course the pilots involved in accidents all liberally assigned blame elsewhere too.) It looks like an aviation smear -- even though written by a high time pilot. Too bad - it could have been good. Good research on hypoxia. Good conclusions on vertigo, flying partial panel, night vision."
1,A warped view of small aircraft safety rife w.misinformation,"Mr. Cohn is an enemy of pilots everywhere. He would increase the burden of legislation on small aircraft, have local police spot checking licences, and require *every* small aircraft to be pressurized. He thinks the oxygen level in the atmosphere decreases at night. This rant of a book is total garbage wrapped in the mantle of safety.Phil Chaddock"
2,Caveat emptor,"The book's content is interesting and, I suppose, somewhat educational. However, there is a hidden, perhaps fatal, flaw. Notwithstanding the misleading subtitle (True Stories Behind General Aviation Accidents), at page xii of the introduction the author concedes [quote]: this book is a work of fiction that is based upon carefully researched and thoroughly documented facts (sic) and enhanced (sic) with contributions from aviation experts.There is no way to tell which portions of the purported accident reports have been slightly modified to preserve confidentiality, and which have been entirely invented by the author. Accordingly, the authenticity of the whole book is highly suspect.If you want to read detailed accounts of imaginary events, by all means buy the book. Anyone searching for accurate reports of real life accidents is better advised to look elsewhere."
2,"Good idea, bad read.","Mr. Cohn presents a few good ideas about needed changes to the general aviation system, but I quickly tired of his exaggerations.Cohn also seems to confuse some of the basics of flying (confusing a Horizontal Situation Indicator HSI with an Attitude Indicator AI). Also, he seems to forget that all pilots are required to know information in the Federal Aviation Regulations and the Airman's Information Manual. I find it hard to blame anyone but the pilot (myself included) when that pilot does not study the information givenI do agree, however, that some of the basic ideas presented in this book would help make General Aviation safer."
4,A enjoyable educational book....,"Unlike so many of the reviews, I both enjoyed the read and found the stories educational - whether fictionalized or not. Private pilots - especially VFR pilots - DO make stupid mistakes like flying into bad weather, like many of the people in this book. They DO fail to communicate with help that is available. I Just spent a weekend at an AOPA conference in Palm Springs and the folks speaking quoted some amazing statistics about fatalities in IMC and a LARGE number.. I don't recall whether it was 40$ or more - but this large number were VFR pilots flying in IMC - just like many of the stories in this book.Why are other pilots afraid to learn from anything they read, whether they are 100% true or fictionalized? Anyone not find old Richard Bach books valuable - like ""just because it's legal doesn't mean it's safe"". Take learning where you can; enjoy a good read; and be a safe pilot."
4,"This album is not his best work, but I still love it!!! :)","Considering he only had 2 months to write and record this album after a long, tiring tour for Valotte, I'd say he did an excellent job with this. Some of the songs, you can tell, have the potential to being great songs. It's a shame he didn't have more time to polish them. And even as they are, they are good songs to listen to. :)My favorites songs on this album are Stick Around (Michael J. Fox appeared in the video...COOL!), You Get What You Want (performed with Billy Joel), Coward Till The End, and This is My Day.If you love Julian Lennon's music, this is a definite must have."
4,Enjoy!,Very nice effort. Too bad he couldn't be as prolific a writer as his Father. The sound is very reminiscent though.
1,Worst Julian Album,"Julian was rushed back in the studio after his 1985 tour, and he never felt he had the time to do this album the way he wanted. It was produced by Billy Joel's producer, but the whole album just is missing something. Only Stick Around and Want My Body sound like music. The rest is hard to listen to."
5,AMAZING!!!,I love love love the Avett Brothers and after seeing their concert I kept telling everyone that their energy onstage cannot be described by listening to their albums alone...they have a way to take a song they have sung hundreds of times and make it new every time...this video totally captures the way the Avett Brothers really are as performers...If you are a fan you will love this DVD and if you are not you will be by the time it is over!
3,Something else to consider,"If you are considering this keyboard, as i was, you may want to check out, at a slightly lower price, the Matias USB 2.0 keyboard for mac. It doesn't have the low profile that the kensington has, but it has two USB ports, as well as one USB 2.0 dock on top of the keyboard. I got mine for $30, and while I still think the kensington is pretty good, the fact that the Matias has three USB ports swayed my decision."
2,well.....,normally i like kensignton products - this keyboard felt nice but after a few weeks of use the paint and silver areas wore away to a yellow plastic under coat. looked pretty tacky.
1,No separate arrow and home/end/PgUp keys,"This keyboard feels nice to type on, but lacks a separate area for arrow keys and for the home/end/PgUp/etc. directional keys. For my work, which involves a lot of typing, the non-standard layout makes this keyboard useless."
1,usb ports a must,"I sent the keyboard back. It didn't have any additional usb ports, not even one for the mouse! Not worth it. Didn't feel like the new Apple keyboard at all."
4,"Good action, OK design, no drivers required","If you do a lot of typing, do yourself a favor and get one of these. I'm a software developer and the Apple aluminum keyboards, while nice to look at and reliable, were driving me crazy. This keyboard has good action, although the height will take some getting used to, compared to the slim Apple keyboard. I was relieved that no drivers are required for the iTunes and volume buttons to work. I'm running Leopard. The iTunes buttons are not very intuitively arranged, e.g. the ""next song"" button is to the left of the ""previous song"" button. Hmm. Overall, I think this keyboard represents good value and a good alternative to the Apple keyboards, which are for people who look at their keyboards but don't use them very much."
4,Does the trick,"I bought this for my mom to replace her old Mac keyboard. She really likes it, has worked well for her, and fits in the fairly small space on her desk. She also thinks it looks nice, ha."
4,"Wish it had USB ports, otherwise it's perfect","I bought this Kensington keyboard to replace a Matias which had USB ports built in. Other than missing this feature, I like the Kensington keyboard, especially because it's very very quiet. I have not had any missed keystrokes which I read were a problem with Apple's similar new thin keyboard. I'd say the Kensington is perfect, though I do wish it had USB ports, even if that made it a little thicker or whatever. It really is a good looking keyboard and works very well."
4,Excellent Mac Mini Companion,"I moved the mac mini to the living room and hooked it to our 40' HD TV. This keyboard was the perfect accessory for that set up. The mac seemed to configure the keyboard without any issue; windows key works as the apple key, volume keys and other special functions keys work as expected. Navigation is easy with the large trackball.So far completely satisfied!"
2,Too small for me,This is a small keyboard. I prefer a full-size keyboard and in retrospect should have spent a little more and gotten theApple Keyboard Kit. This keyboard is too small for me and I make a lot of mistakes.
3,davis sparkles over a dull listless cast,"dark victory is regarded as davis better movies, indeed as her performance is excellent, but as a movie it proves as somewhat dull and disappointing. Davis stars along with george brent, who is undoubtedly the worst performance ever, with a habgover look on his face and irritatingly annoying constantly, rather than being in love with davis, his dead pan face just stares at her, giving very unconvincing lines out. Davis is at her bitchiest best with humphrey bogart, who plays a mere stablehand who secretly is in love with davis. For davis fans alone this movie is terrific, as a watch it only passes as good."
1,Hilariously bad,"This is one movie that plays like a Carol Burnett sketch from start to finish. The climax, where Davis tries to hide her blindness from her husband, had me cramping up from laughing so hard. Enjoy!"
4,Marvelous Melodrama,"Tour de force camp fest for Bette Davis and her legions of fans. Almost every cliche that has become fodder for Davis impersonators (from Carol Burnett to Charles Pierce) are in this one...the swagger, the clipped speech, the cigarette holder and chronic/constant puffing, the one-line jabs and popping eyes. This one is elevated from mere melodrama by an admirable supporting cast and top notch production values. But if the genre isn't your cuppa, it will be a long 104 minutes.This DVD print is wonderful. Crystal clear...looks and sounds terrific and the real reason to include this one in your library of classics. The commentary track, unfortunately, is virtually worthless..the two film afficianadoes offer little more than their own ooh'ing and aah'ing. Better off calling it an ""opinion"" track."
2,GREAT MOVIE GETS A DISMAL TRANSFER,"Bette Davis is outstanding as Judy Traherne, a Long Island rich girl with a fatal brain tumor. For a time Judy believes that she's been cured, a myth supported by her doctor (George Brent)who is starting to fall in love with her. Cameos by Ronald Reagan and Humphrey Bogart are welcomed inclusions that enhance the film's dramatic appeal.Unfortunately, Warner acquired this title from a tired, worn print in the MGM library. The print is full of grain, chips, scratches, inconsistant shadow and contrast delineation and digital grit. There are several occasions where the entire image within the frame wobbles up and down, due to worn out sprocket holes. The visual experience during such instances is akin to riding a canoe through choppy seas. The audio is strident and scratchy. Overall this is a disappointing visual experience and one that Warner needs to rectify soon, before we lose this great classic forever to the ravages of time."
5,Bette Davis finest,This one of Bette Davis finest works. From start to finish the movie catchest your attention. It is movie magic with a sad ending. Buy it or Rent it.
5,Dark Victory,One of Bette Davis best movies. Done during a more innocent time when movies were a weekly treat. The story line was a little predictable but none the less entertaining.
4,Fast reading autobiography of comedy great,"Joe Besser should have stuck with his original title of ""Not Just A Stooge"" because he was so much more. This book covers his entire life from the early days of running away to become a magician's assistant, getting parental consent after the fact, to his early days in vaudeville, early stage and radio work right on through film and television. It is told in a likable conversational tone. For me, the highlight of his varied roles was as Stinky on the Abbott and Costello tv show.His work with the Stooges was underrated but Stinky was his masterpiece.A nice book about a nice man."
3,WEST COAST QUIK,"To appreciate music you must first get rid of the east coast bias. This shows Dj Quik at one of his best rapping CD even. This is the type of CD that you need to listen to in your car cruising down the street leaning back in your seat cooling it. I would have rated this four stars, except for the cursing and the n words. Other than that it's great. Go West coast."
3,Seahorses - 'Do It Yourself' (Geffen),"Apparently,this was their only album.Guitarist John Squire used to be a member of the Stone Roses.'Do It Yourself' was produced by Tony Visconti(Bowie,Thin Lizzy,T.Rex).That's ironic because the CD does employ somewhat of a '70's sound to it.I would describe the Seahorses as 'advanced serious pop'.I remember seeing their semi-outstanding video for ""Love Is The Law"".Other tunes I liked here on the CD release were ""I Want You To Know"",""Round The Universe"" and ""Standing On Your Head"".If you dig,say vintage Bad Company,you should like this disc."
3,Not a bad album,"The Seahorses never made here in the US in a big way, but that doesn't mean that this CD doesn't deserve a listen.I would best describe it as brit rock with a bit of classic rock influence, laced with some humourous lyrics. My favorite being: ""There's no such thing as a second chance, look at Auntie George and Uncle Mabel.""Chris Helme provides solid vocals and John Squire's guitar is tight, and put together their songs are bouncy and mostly feel-good, although some are quite long.My preferred songs: I Want You To Know, Blinded By The Sun, Love Is The Law, Love Me And Leave Me.Ok, so they don't sound like The Stone Roses, but I don't think they are trying to. Give this CD a go if you like middle of the road rock with jamming, long songs."
3,Not Great But Not Terrible,"This album is by no means anywhere near the brilliance of The Stone Roses, so do not listen to this album with high expectations. This is not a bad album though, with the first half being stronger than the second. It is definitely worth a listen, especially since you can pick it up for under three bucks."
3,strokes of unique talent,"John Squire, one of Britain's best modern guitarists, is the force behind The Seahorses who here have released an alternately melancholic and absurdly enthused album peppered by some rousing tunes.The centerpiece is the song Love Is The Law, a release that beams with free-spiritedness and an extended revel of guitar soloing. Love Me And Leave Me is partly penned by Liam Gallagher of Oasis and it shows bright rays of color. The Boy In The Picture is another stand-out, with its passion for things lost.Most of the other tracks tag along or are downright late in arriving, all retain strokes of unique talent."
2,A very poor album.,"This band was formed by John Squire, ex-guitarist with Manchester band Stone Roses. Anyone familiar with Squire's superb work on the Roses' albums will be thoroughly disappointed with this weak effort. The songs have little or no individuality or quality, descending into bland, soulless sub-rock territory. Squire should know better. His guitar-playing is the one decent thing about this record but that is no reason to buy it. If you don't have the Stone Roses debut album, get that instead. Please!"
3,Good but Disappointing,"Well, I am a huge fan of the Stone Roses and this is definately not them. The album is good but not great. It has a couple of strong songs like Love is the Law and Blinded by the Sun and The Boy in the Picture, Happiness is Eggshaped is catchy but goofy. I came away feeling like this album said nothing and it did not keep me coming back for more that's for sure. Not alot of innovative Brit pop here but an average rock album if you are desperate."
3,Worth A Listen,"Ok, this isn't a Stone Roses album. I'm sorry that they broke up but we have to face the fact. With that being said I think this album is worth buying especially since there are enough people looking to get rid of it that you can now pick it up for under a [money amount]. John Squire's workon this album is worth paying the [money amount]or less.My favorite track so far is ""Round the Universe."" It's a Zeppelin-influenced track with a pop feeling. On the last track, ""Hello,"" we see vocalist Chris Helme sounding like the big Brit-pop contemporaries Travis and Coldplay. If for nothing else just get this album and enjoy Helme's voice and Squire's guitar playing."
2,"No, no, no","After his previous marvellous group, the great John Squire release a terrible cd, with a group far from what he deserved. Apart from a couple of decent songs, neither his compositions are good. A pity"
4,Just have a listen you'll be surprised!,"This album has all the characteristics of a great album. Its well co-ordinated catchy ""choons"" really bring the album to life. Allthough Mr. squire is not quite up to scratch i believe that this bring out the character in the band. My oppinion ""well worth a listen""."
2,I'm trying to be nice here!,"The fact that people are giving this 5 stars is rather worrying for the future of music! As a Stone Roses fan I naturally had to buy this album, but as a music fan I wish I hadn't. With the exception of ""Love is the Law"" none of the songs Squire wrote appealed to me- too neat and tidy, verse-chorus-bridge; almost like made to order parcels! The singer in the band, a guy Squire hired after hearing sing on a street in Oxford, wrote three of the better songs on the album and this kinda saves it. John Squire is an amazing guitarist but this album sounded like he was going through the motions and the rather flat bass/drum backing did'nt help either.If you want to buy something like the Stone Roses buy Ian Brown's ""Unfinished Monkey Business"". It appears that without this guy Squire is set for obscurity."
3,What could have been.......,"""Do it Yourself"" is pleasing, if a little slight. SOme songs stand out with great melodies and powerful guitar riffs (see ""love is the law"" and ""blinded by the sun"") but as a whole, it lacks any real attitude, or for want of a better word: magic. Missing someone like Ian Brown perhaps? Anyhow, considering this will be the Seahorses one and only album, buy it when its lying in the bargain bin."
5,correction,"Editor: I wrote one of the reviews of this book already included on your website. But there was a typo in my original version. I wrote ""21st century"" when I obviously meant ""20th century"" in describing the century in which Linus Pauling lived. Do you think you could correct this typo? Thanks.William OttMontgomery Village, MD"
4,Pauling's Life?,"The Hager book is not bad at all, though I would not rank it above the Serafini book. Probably the motivation for saying this is that there is less of Pauling's science in the Serafini book and more in Hager's book. However, many reviewers miss the point that the purpose of a biography is to delve into a subject's life and personality -- not the details of his work. And, in any case, Pauling stopped doing any serious science before the 60's began and in fact left Caltech near the beginning of that decade, thereafter devoting his life mainly to silly peace crusades, vitamin C hokum and such things. So in this respect the Serafini book is actually more in proportion to Pauling's serious work in science and does a fairly good job. In this respect also, the Goertzel book in my view also does well, although the latter is a bit too ""psychoanalytical"" for my taste ."
5,Very Happy!,"I'm really happy I found this case with clip. I've had the same old-style flip phone for years and I loved the fact that I could clip my phone to my purse instead of searching through my purse. I was frantic when my old case's clip broke beyond repair and I was once again digging though my purse to retreive a ringing phone. The case also protects the phone from scratches, bumps and the occassional unexpected downpour. Great product and very quick delivery from seller!"
5,motorola body glove,this thing is great protection for motorola cell phone V325. It really is great for what it does. you just cant beat the price either!
5,Great Item!,"I bought the red Sylvania 250 watt heat lamps to go with this unit, and it works great. Good for a decent size bathroom. I'm ordering the single bulb model for my guest bath which is smaller. I have mine on a leviton timer switch."
3,wrong order,Cannot rate as I sent it back I ordered the wrong size. Overall the unit looked solid and would do the job nicely
2,The Least Interesting of Gordon's Blue Notes,But it's still Dex and so worthwhile. But get Our Man in Paris and Doin' Alright first.
5,An Amazing Read for Godzilla & Film Fans,"This is an amazing book and I am absolutely fascinated by it, from both the standpoint of a film buff as well as a Gojira fan. I certainly hope Mr. Kalat does a follow-up now that G is enjoying a rebirth in Japanese cinema (from Godzilla Millenium to GMK and beyond) and the book itself stops at Godzilla v Destroyah, his supposed ""death"" in Japan. (The plan was to turn the reins over to Tri-Star in the USA, but since the '98 American Godzilla stunk so very much, fans worldwide convinced Toho to revive it in their own image).Excellent book for both film fan and Godzilla lover. No pictures, no diagrams, no schlock; just great writing and amazing detail."
4,All the info you'll EVER need on Godzilla,This book is GREAT! The KING of any and all Godzilla books. Kalat does a great job of showing how the American press and America in general missed much of what Godzilla is all about thanks to the way the movies were shown in America. He explains who godzilla is in the context of Japanese culture. A great index covers everything.
1,Not the best,"I wish that I would have paid closer attention to the other reviews. I would have NEVER purchase this book. I have looked through it at least 10 times and I still cannot find a single pattern that I want to try. I think it is a book that is good for kids, young kids. I recieved it quickly and the patterns are real easy but I have to admit that I was highly dissapointed."
3,Nice,"The book itself isn't quite what I was hoping for; however, I was impressed with how quickly I received the book itself. There are a few nice designs within the book, but also a few corny ones, too. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase."
4,Marilyn Monroe Dyed Here,"Chris Epting's 'Marilyn Monroe Dyed Here' because of its pick-up/put-down style, is a must-have, must-read coffee table or bathroom reader. We were thrilled to see in it places we have visited, intrigued by places we now hope to visit, and mortified to learn of places we walked past unknowingly. The book is very well researched and amusingly yet informatively written."
3,Not as compelling as it should be,"I found the extra feature, an extended take on how director Ridley Scott made the movie, to be more interesting than the actual film, which I had to pause a few times to get through. Nicolas Cage's various tics here as an obsessive-compulsive are uncomfortable to watch, though his performance is great, as usual for Cage. The sets in suburban Los Angeles were interesting to look at. Even the Sinatra soundtrack - why, really? - wasn't bad. I guess it was the plot that let me down. Also, is it a comedy or a character study? You find out in the extra that this question vexed the post-production, as well. The major plot twist that occupies the final 20 percent of the film wasn't all that surprising. A passing entertainment."
3,Uninspired con-men film,"The Bottom Line:Matchstick Men might appeal more to people who haven't seen a lot of films about con men, but if you're familiar with the genre you'll find very little here to get excited about; though the characters are developed to the point where you care what happens to them at the end, the machinations of the screenplay are exceedingly familiar and contrived and prevent the story from earning entry into the upper echelon of the genre with Mamet's films and The Sting.2.5/4"
4,I liked it.,"While I thought this was a good movie, there are many who might disagree with me. The one this I absolutely hated is this movie case...cardboard and a plastic clip - doesn't stay closed, or breaks."
3,They should have struck the match !!,"What a waste! Nicolas Cage stars as a neurotic, OCD-affected conman who ends up finding a ""lost"" offspring while working with his conman partner. While I won't give away the ending, suffice it to say that Nicolas gets ""burned"".Along the way, he befriends his 15-year old daughter he never knew he had, but neither draw the viewer in to any great extent, and you end up asking ... ""Who cares??""Special Features?? I never became interested enough to check them out!What a ""yawner""... save your time... and money!"
2,Will someone please explain the meaning of the title?,"I did not especially appreciate this film. Calling this a comedy/drama is stretching both categories and after viewing it you do not come away with any sense of finality or satisfaction.The characters have no real charisma where you can relate to them or sympathize with their predicament. Nicholas Cage is brilliant as the phobia-ridden Roy but after a while his facial tics and mannerisms become distracting. The camera angles with constant ""thru the window"" shots are annoying and unecessary. There are some rather confusing scenes towards the end especially between Roy and his ex-wife. If you listen to the directors commentary, on the DVD, at this point he comes across very pompous, self-serving and totally uncaring about his audience. (Sorry Ridley)."
3,"Not the Sting,but not bad!","Cage is excellent and the supporting cast is quite good. Cage's quirks may be overdone, but that is probably intended. The plot--with its interesting twist--has some inconsistencies, but is fun."
5,Matchstick Men (2003),"Matchstick Men was probably the best movie that I had seen all year. I didn't find one part of it boring at all and found myself on the edge of my seat for a while. The ending had such a twist, I was confused for a while, then everything made sense. I rented this movie as soon as it came out and then bought it, its definitely worth watching again."
3,It didn't suck. This is a renter.,"The advert says ""Imaginative. A wonderful, wonderful movie.""I'll admit to it being clever, & not leaving me with that semi desperate there's-2-hours-of-my-life-I-can-never-get-back feeling.About the best thing that can be said about this flick is that Cage was his usual outstanding self, & he must have had a ball playing the character."
2,Great movie until that horrible twist,"This is one of those movies that needed to just play it straight. The acting was great and the concept, sans twist, was great. But this movie, like many others, tried to be too clever for its own good. Granted this movie came out before M Night Shamalambadingdong was appointed his Hack status, but in general movie creators need to take him as an example when making movies. You dont have to put twist in everything. Sometimes just let the drama play. Let the movie be about characters and interactions, don't be too plotty. Because after a while you get potty."
2,"Another weekend, another Nicholas Cage movie","Ridley scott is a brilliant director and Nicholas Cage has a firm grasp on the art of acting. Unfortunately even all that skill and heart can't save Matchstick Men. First of all it about conmen, so right from the get go its oh ready riddled with cliches. Cage plays a conman who finds his heart after he realizes he has a daughter, so he has an epiphany. Despite the contrived plot Cage brings real charisma to the role, picking up where he left off with Adaptation. The movie sucks but Cage makes it worth seeing."
2,Diassapointed film,"Ridley Scott is one of the top directors in the world. That's undeniable , but what happened with this one?The plot is boring , even ridiculous . Nicolas Cage is perfect in his role but the script goes to nowhere . This film seems inspirated for House of games and a moral lesson for fathers. And the film remains in the middle of the road.I couldn't believe this film carried the signature of Ridley Scott.A minor movie for a status director . As you see the marriage can not result in a happy ending."
5,A Brief Rundown of Matchstick Men,"Matchstick Men has so many twists and turns it's a thrill just trying to keep up. This is one of the greatest movies in the world, and while the ""extra features"" on this DVD leave more to be desired, the movie itself should be enough to convince you to purchase. In this movie, Nicholas Cage and Sam Rochwell play Matchstick Men (con artists) struggling to keep their fruitful partnership alive. Sam Rockwell wants to engage in a very profitable con, but the conservative Cage isn't sure. But when Cage's daughter shows up at his doorstep, everything changes for Nicholas. This is only the beginning and this movie is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat right up until the end."
2,Matchstick Men,Wow it was not at all what I expected. I was thinking it was full of action and it was not. If you are a Nickolas Cage fan you might like this film but other an that it was not interesting for me any way. Came fast and great conditions.
5,A tiny gem of a film!,"A decently made drama from beginning to end. The film starts slow but then takes on a brilliant flow, from the beginning itself, you are easily glued to the screen, totally engaged in the characters, specially 'Roy' played brilliantly by Nicholas Cage, 'Roy' is a person who will communicate to you with just his eyes and facial expressions and Cage effortlessly breathes enough life into the character, making this one of his best performances without a doubt and it is actually 'Roy' you are witnessing and not the actor Nicholas Cage. Surprisingly brilliant performance from Alison Lohman who plays 'Angela'. The chemistry between Cage and Lohman are just enough to get you involved in the whole scenario of the film. A similarly good performance from Sam Rockwell as well. 'Matchstick men' will surely draw you to its situations, the moods and mostly its characters. A tiny little gem of a film, not to be missed."
5,Surprisingly Good,"Nicolas Cage is a con man with almost an almost debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder. He's very good at his profession but has difficulty functioning outside of that. This off beat, not-your-typically con artist movie meanders a bit in the beginning, but stick with it. It develops into a really good movie. The less you know about this movie going into it the better."
2,Transparent Plot,"Matchstick Men falls well short of being a good movie. The plot is utterly transparent and there are no surprises. Maybe fifteen mintutes into the movie you will figure out the entire plot, and then you will cease to care about the characters. With the illusion shattered, you will quickly loose interest. The whole movie you hope that it isn't so, but it is. There is a little redemtive arc at the end for Cage's character, but this still leaves the audience feeling empty and unfulfilled. I would only suggest watching this movie if you see it on cable and there is nothing else on, otherwise do not bother buying or renting it."
2,Boring. Dull.,Nicolas Cage plays an obsessive-compulsive con-man in this extremely tedious film. His life is turned upside down when he learns he has a daughter. That makes him reassess his life and values.That's all you need to know because this movie is as slow as it is uninteresting. The daughter brings almost no energy to this plot and about 90 minutes passes before anything even remotely interesting happens. I'm getting bored just trying to write about this dog of a film.
2,Your future TV movie of the week !,"Okay and who made it ? Waooo Ridley Scott ? tHAT'S THE GUY WHO MADE alien, NO ? Cool and who is the main actor ? Nicolas Cage ! Terrific !!!! Is he the guy who plaid in LEAVING LAS VEGAS and 8MM ...? oH yEAH bABY ! I will have a great moment...THE END !What the hell ! Much talent for so little flick ! It's so predictable.I knew what it will happen as soon as he met his daughter.It's disappointing and Cage is wasting his time and talent.I easily understand why he chose to be involved in ADAPTATION but this time,there is absolutely no reason.There is nothing to keep in mind.It's EMPTY.The twist has been seen in better movies and the end is simply kind of ""I KNEW IT"" It's not because they waste their time that you also have to.Give up ! And wait that it appears in your TV guide."
4,Entertaining Film,"Superb acting by the cast--Nicholas Cage played a great con-man with obsessive-compulsive tendencies, Sam Rockwell was the sleazy stereotypical con-man, and Alison Lohman played Cage's long-lost daughter perfectly. The movie felt very ""California"" with the lights, and the cinematography. Ridley Scott proved that he is a versatile director in this movie."
5,One of the Years Best Films!,"Nic Cage and Sam Rockwell are excellent and both deserve Oscar Nominations. Alison Lohman who is really over 22 in real life is great and believable as the innocent 14 year old daughter of Nic's character. This movie is done in the same light tone as ""Catch Me If You Can,"" the only difference being that it is way better. The only small problem I have with the movie is the cheesy tacked on ending that follows the words..ONE YEAR LATER. I would actually suggest leaving the theater instead of watching the last 10 mins. The original ending ends on a depressing but realistic note following a series of plot twists, which was great for me. The tacked on ending is too sappy and detracts from realism of the characters we have gotten to know over the past 2 hours. Basically the ending was too ""hollywood"" for me and the other people I saw it with. But we all agreed, ending aside, this is one of the best and funniest films of the year. Let the Oscar nods roll."
3,Shipping takes too long,3 Stars for effort. But I'll have to pass since shipping is between 6-10 days. I mean come on Amazon I am a Prime member and I would expect my pen shipped to me in 2 days or earlier. But since this pen is not part of the Prime membership I'll look elsewhere - maybe Walmart. Do you think they have pens like these? Anyone??? Plus you have to watch out about these pen manufacturers as I have heard they sell these pens cheap because they make a profit on the ink.
3,lol @ Amazon... really?,"I found this pen because for some reason seeing as I am a huge fan of all things paper and pen related, Amazon posted the alluring ad on my home page entitled, ""Luxury pens you can use everyday!"" Why yes, Amazon I could use this pen everyday (with no fear of someone snaking my pen as we all know eventually happens to every pen) because I am of course, the long lost princess of Dubai! The only thing more silly and self-absorbed piggish *considering all the poverty in the world* than this pen is the one they showed me after looking at it for $42,000.00... the amazing and magical, grant your every wish genie hiding inside, Tibaldi Crewe 60th Rollerball Pen.Now I am just outraged that they had the nerve to show this cheap hunk of junk in the first place!"
3,well it's ok i mean,"I was attracted to this pen 'cause of its solid goldness --- but noticed that it was on sale - and further noticed that that the gold is only 18Kt. Most of the world live on 22-24 Kt - this one does not meet the cut. Still I like the 34 Diamond, and decided to purchase it for my pet howling monkey I got from the jungles of southern Mexico."
1,"Poor quality, tiny video image","This was not a good purchase. I got the same quality on-line looking at You Tube. As another reviewer points out, the picture is tiny only about 1/4 of the screen and is not really suitable for showing at a movie night."
1,"Low quality, doesn't fill entire screen","These were originally downloaded from Internet Moving Archives. The videos only fit the center of the screen.Low quality, I dont recommend."
3,Typical Costume Wig,"This wig has a zig zag part line on top and is matted and frizzy in that area. The wig is a typical coarse halloween wig, but it did it's job."
1,Highly disappointing - I'd skip it.,"Having read rave reviews of Rachel Ray's cook books, I had high expectations. When I got the book and scanned the table of contents, I was already a little leery - many of the recipes seemed like things for which you'd barely need a recipe and the range of foods was really limiting. Plus it's organized by odd types like ""make your own take out"" - so I needed to scan individual recipes to find what to do with the chicken in my refridgerator.The first meal was mostly thrown out. My husband and I ate small amounts, but supplemented with other things. The leftovers went in the garbage. My kids had peanut butter sandwiches - so much for kid-friendly.There are much better cook it in a hour or less cookbooks and I strongly recommend AGAINST this one. I actually bought two online and I'm planning on returning the one I haven't used."
3,Not a lot of variety,"I'm enjoying this cookbook, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of variety. A lot of variations of the same thing. But for someone who's in a cooking rut like me, it doesn't really matter. It's all new dishes to me."
3,I Wanted More,"I am such a HUGE fan of Rachael Ray and her TV Show ""30 Minute Meals,"" that I couldn't wait to get my book in the mail. But when it came, I was so disappointed to find that there wasn't one picture in the entire book! I am still a novice at cooking and am drawn to the pictures of an entree before I attempt to make it. If you're not an expert who can use their imagination to know what the dish will look like, you'll probably be a bit disappointed like me. The only reason I'm still going to try the recipes is because I watch her show, have made her meals, and have been pleased with the results."
3,There are better books to be had,"This book was ok, but it seemed a little cheaply made. There are no pictures of anything. I am a beginner with the art of cooking and this book did very little to help me out."
4,"Great Recipies, Not Organized Well, Not Too Healthy","The recipes are easy, quick, convenient and WONDERFUL to the taste! She has some great shortcuts and you end up using ingredients you have never heard of before. Definately great for entertaining as well. However, most of the recipies include alot of heavy milks and butters and aren't necessarily figure-friendly... The book is not organized as well as 30-Minute Meals 2, you have to really read through to figure out what some of the meals consist of."
2,Rachel has no formal chef training and it shows;,"Rachel Rays personality is her greatest asset. She has no formal chef training and most of her recipes are very basic and somewhat bland. She seems like a fun person, and in todays television rich society, at times if your liked, it masks a lot of imperfections.Her cookbooks are always somewhat unorganized due to the lack of quality indexes and pictures. Her recipes are also hit and miss; I think her sauces are bad at times, but sometimes she has a great idea for a simple appetizer or pasta. Again, very basic cooking but with her personality, she could pretty much sell anything. I think she'll continue to grow though and hopefully the food network won't ruin her.She will never be an all-star chef but she's a good spokesperson for simple dishes, and hopefully her books will improve as she does; I think both will get better."
1,This Book is a real miss,Rachael Ray has no talent as an author or a cook. This book is full of recipes that you would find in any home ec course in high school. I returned it as quickly as I could.
2,Not-Delish,"Not only can the meals in this book not, in fact, be prepared in 30 minutes, they are also not yum-yum. Once, while watching her show, I noticed that she placed some potatoes in the microwave at 18:01. Then, at 18:08, she took the potatoes out of the microwave and claimed they were in there for 12 minutues. This sounds more like 34 minute meals to me! Also, 40 dollars a day is bogus...you cannot sleep through breakfast and trade your hat in for a meal and then claim it is 40.D.A.D.- 40 Dollars a Day. I do not like the book."
1,E.V.O.O Oh No.No.No.,"Rachel Ray has to be the most annoying person on cable television, if not, at least in the top 10 - right behind Bill O'Reilly, Suze Oreman, and that Oxy/Orange Clean fool.Yes, some of her recipes may be enticing but who can stand to watch her for 30 minutes with her ""delish"" and her ""evoo"" and her ""MMMHHHMMMmmmmHHHMMMHHHHhhmmmm"" as she stuffs her mouth with her own creations. I surely can't. And WAY too much hand movement - I don't care if she is Italian. No excuse. Kill the stereotypes.So, in summary - mediocre recipes and annoyance at a blistering level - forces me to give Ms. ...D.A.D a single star (actually, a single star is the lowest rating amazon.com allows). But at least with this cookbook you don't have to hear her mouth. Praise the Gods."
3,SO_SO,"Purchaed both 30 min meals, not as many recipes for family dinner. I only used a few recipes in this book. 30 min meal 2 is much better"
4,30 Minute Meals,"I love the new book.It's easy and quick . I love My Monte Cristos,It's different and very good.I can't wait to make it for my friends."
3,"Fans of the show, beware!","I bought this book mainly because I am a fan of the show and I was a little disappointed. On the show the recipes are creative and include a whole meal, but in this book there are a lot of variations on tomato sauce and tacos and they are not laid out as an entire meal. I am sure the recipes are still good and can be made in 30 minutes, but I probably won't be using this book very much. However, I will be eagerly awaiting a new book with more recent recipes and a 30 minute MEAL layout."
4,Awesome cookbook!,"If you are planner, like good a variety of quality meals and work full-time, this is the perfect cookbook to have! You can look over the quick meal plans, make a plan for the week, and finally make sure you have what you need on hand. There are two reasons why I don't give this cookbook 5 stars: 1 - Most of the recipes are very good, but not all and 2 - The average cook will take a bit longer than 30 minutes to prepare these meals. We love that Racheal uses fresh and easy to find ingredients!"
1,No pictures,"I think, having a cookbook with no pictures is rediculous. I work during the week so I dont often get to watch the show but I always liked it..Til Now..After buying 6 cook books, 5 with little or no pictures, I was furious..it's pure laziness..just a way to make money without quality. I will never watch the show or buy a book from her again..I'm so mad!"
3,No Photos,"I like to watch Rachel Ray on the Food Network, and was used to seeing how the preparation of the food evolved. There is no such luxury in this book. The recipes are good, but no clue is given as to how the food would look when finished. To me, this is half the fun of preparing food. Keep this in mind if you are ordering this book."
1,Read This Before you Think about Buying This Book!,"First of all, I love the show ""30 Minute Meals and think Rachael Ray is GREAT! BUT..... this book came out before her 30 Minute Meals show, and the recipes were created several years ago before she ""Fine-tuned"" them for the show. If you compare her recipes in the book to those you get from her show you will see a big difference, and the new fine-tuned recipes she has on the show are MUCH better. I was very disappointed with the book. My advice to anyone wishing to purchase this book....... You know she's going to come out with an updated version eventually, so save your money for the real deal, the newer recipes!"
3,Doesn't do Rachael's talent justice,"Rachael's Ray's TV Show 30-minute Meals is a joy to watch, and it is unfortunate that this book does not do her talent justice. The book has no colour, no photos, and the recipes are not nearly as interesting as the wonderful dishes she prepares on her show. I would have expected a more colourful book and a more varied selection of dishes."
3,"Good, but flawed","I purchased this book because I wanted a collection of the recipes from the show. Some of the best are in here, included the fabulous Curry with built-in chutney. But the recipes I am looking for are hard to find, as there is no index and the chapters are organized in a playful but not-so-helpful manner. For instance, I saw an interesting recipe for a chicken pot pie made with a hollowed out bread round. I know it's in here, but is it in the ""Comfort Food"" chapter? ""Kid's Favorites""? ""Meals with fewer than 10 ingredients""? It's a bit frustrating. Finally, there are too many burger recipes (11) for my taste.On the plus side, the book does not suffer from the overly cutesy manner that Ms. Ray often affects on the show. It is a straightforward listing of the recipes. I just wish that the book was better organized, had included an index, and a few pictures."

5,Marilyn Monroe Fan,I've always loved Marilyn Monroe movies. It's nice to get a box set that I can keep and watch over and over.
5,Marilyn Monroe,"I am a long time Marilyn Monroe fan. When I saw this set at such a great price, I ordered it. It has five or her best movies in the set. Some people have criticized this set because the packaging is cheap. That is true but I did not order the set for the packaging. When I opened it, the discs fell out on the floor, but I put them back in their slots and the are now secure. The movies are great, and I recommend the set."
2,Packaging,I would have rated this collection higher but the packaging is so bad it only gets 2 Stars. When will the folks who make these decisions learn that how you display and safeguard the product matters? When I received the product all the disks had become dislodged. So far I have not experienced any damaged discs. The cardboard is so slippery that whenever you pick up the box everything falls out. The sections where the disc fit into have already begun to rip apart. I am going to repack my set into my own “REAL” DVD cases. Will not recommend to others nor will I buy any other collection that are packaged this way.As for the movies themselves; I am fine with the selection of movies chosen. For those who pan the product they must not have read the description since it clearly states what is in the box.
4,"Great overall, but a few strange choices","The selection of films is good but not perfect as other reviewers have noted. The packaging is DVD size, not Blu-ray size and a little flimsy. Other than that no complaints about the content, and overall it's a good deal for all these films, but not exactly the definitive Maryilyn collection."
4,Great Movie Set,Not all the movies I would like to have seen included in a Marilyn Monroe. But an OK remaster of certain select movies representing her work.
5,Marilyn fan!,What a great offer to a Marilyn fan! Daughter will love it! Please stop requiring more than a phrase! Get rid of the requirement to do so many words or I will stop rating my purchases
3,I'm kind of let down by this set.,I am A HUGE Marilyn Monroe fan and I am kind of let down by this set. Where is Niagara and Bus Stop those are two of her biggest movies also. Now I have all of these movies on DVD and the special features on the new Blue Ray set are the exact same ones that are on my TWO DVD box sets The Diamond Collection's one and two that came out A few years back. I am also hearing from other Marilyn fans that there is no real difference in picture quality and sound. There are A few other Marilyn movies that were released to blue ray prior to this one coming out in July. Yea I'm not sure if I will getting this set? Another reason this is coming out is the 50TH anniversary of her death which is August 2ND of this year so the company who is releasing this set is just out to make A buck or two off of Marilyn Monroe. Now this is just A point of view from A Marilyn fan you can take it how every you want to.
2,Marilyn you are overrated!,"If this is the best of Marilyn, I'm not impressed. She's a really blond ditz! I never saw where any real acting was necessary or done. I think Hollywood was doing what Hollywood does, selling a product! Marilyn was a tool when I was a kid, and was great bathroom viewing the product when I was a kid. Never noticed her eyes until these movies, but they are a dream come true along with he greatest female voice on record. But I never noticed much else especially really good movies. I hope Marilyn was deeper than all of that."
3,No new extras,"As this will not be released until July, my rating is a reflection of my diappointment in Fox's not updating its extras (apparently)and including two old releases with these Blu-rays. Certainly I am looking forward to the Fox features to be released on Blu-ray - please dont think my rating which is required by Amazon is a review of the actual BRs - MM's TNBLSB and RONR in BR should really benefit from high definition as well as GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES -But why couldn't Fox do any new extras at all ??? Come on - maybe they could get Mitzi Gaynor for a commentary for NBLSB -- or do some short behind the scenes documentaries on all these Fox films -- and really -- why include the two UA features already available?? - most MM fans have one or both - but they can jack up the price that way - what a shame -"
3,glass half full,Too bad this set didn't include what I belive were two of her best performancesGiant & Bus Stop. oh wellbillw...
2,Marilyn,"No extras??? Making the minimum effort and bearing the price in mind, Why could Fox not pull out the 1963 documentary, narrated by Rock Hudson that they released theatrically capitalizing on her death earlier that year? It has never been seen since, never available on DVD, and would have served to make this collection a must have! Seems they are missing the boat on this.......and the price? I don't think so."
3,Where is NIAGARA?,"I was very interested in this box until I came to know the titles. Her greatest, at last for me, is NIAGARA, and just that title is missing. Besides that, some titles were released on Blu Ray before, so why not give us the missing titles instead that we have to buy titles we already own on Blue Ray all over again. And allthough I have a good and not cheap Blu Ray player I think a lot of titles were better on DVD. Most of the time I don't see that movies on Blu Ray are so much better than on DVD, it's often just the way around."
3,THE FINAL DAYS,"Along with NIAGARA and BUS STOP, Fox is making a big mistake in not releasing the documentary, MARILYN:THE FINAL DAYS. IT seems odd that they re-release SOME LIKE IT HOT and THE MISFITS already in blu ray and leave these others out. If they were going to leave something out, why not RIVER OF NO RETURN? Very odd marketing."
1,"""THE FINAL DAYS"" NOT INCLUDED - SO I'LL PASS.","I'll stick with my already complete DVD collection, since for some wacky reason, some idiot/s chose not to include ""The Final Days""."
1,"No ""Niagra"" No Sale Here!","I Have to agree with almost everyone.No Niagra and Bus Stop and or no documentary buy this now and then layout more money for a more complete set later, I don't think so."
1,Keep it.,"What? No ""Niagara?"" And you expect me to buy it? No way! In that movie, Marilyn shows her walk and no woman has ever being able to do it better. Her walk it's the essence of femininity. We are right: No ""Niagara"" no sale."
5,Really Fun Toy!,"This arrived today and I couldn't wait to rip it right of the of the box. It does not disappoint. The installation was a breeze, just hotsynch the software and go. Photos are pretty good quality for a small digi-cam such as this, even the low-light ones came out well.I'm using this camera with the Kyocera 7135 Smartphone. On screen display seems a bit sluggish, but that could be the phone. For those using the same phone, you need to go to the veo website to download an adapter patch for the software. It was easily locatable on the site and fixed the screen orientation problem.The sleek bullet-like case is very handy and perfectly fits the camera. This is proving to be a neat little toy."
1,save the extra few hundred to buy a real one,This camera was junk you cant even try to take a picture with it outside. I couldnt get the thing to focus and the only thing it was good for was taking a picture of myself from 8 inches away and even that pic looked [bad]. Id give it no stars the scale dosnt go that low. This camera should be a toy in a happy meal. Dont waste the money just wait a few more weeks till you have enough saved to go buy regular digital camera for 300 bucks or so my brother has a nice one that has a multi media card slot and was just as easy to take pics with that and then just put the card in my treo as using the veo sd and the pics with my brothers camera acaully looked like normal pics instead of a cover on some old 60's acid music cd.
3,Hard to focus,The lens is focused by turning a small conical shaped portion of the housing (hard to grab) more that 360 degrees to get the full range. My PDA resolution is 160x160 and it's hard to tell when you've got the image in focus or not.
1,Terrible product,"Veo takes blurred pictures, is very slow, holds only 10 at a time. Flimsy, like a CrackerJack prize. Veo software is a space hog. And it automatically loads two more pieces of software -- one to transmit the pics to another device, which requires a compatible ISP (more software), and one with no apparent purpose except to occupy PDA space until you pay more to get an ""unlock"" key and open it.Plus, the Veo software screws up Launch'Em and/or OS-5.It took a hard reset to get rid of the problems Veo caused. ... Veo is a real disappointment."
1,Does not work,The product never worked for me...but by the time I realized I had already left the country so I didn't bother returning it. For this I would probably go into a store and testing it out first. I learnt my lesson the hard way...learn from my mistakes.
5,Amazing Recording!,"I'm fairly new to jazz, but have been into music many moons. Rudy Van Gelder's work on this (and vol.2) recording was stellar in and of itself. This digital version is just jaw-dropping; it sounds like (if not better than) a contemporary live recording. That it's the original artists in the real setting is fabulous. The performances are real, spot-on and fresh. These volumes should be considered must-have for anyone remotely interested in jazz."
2,Huh?,"I remember when being a ""favorite of the critics"" meant something. That was back when the critics actually annointed fresh and interesting music as thier favorites. I utterly fail to understand the buzz about ""Kid A."" I even more can't get the kudos being given it as being ""daring"" and ""profound."" Hello? Have the critics stopped listening to music? Radiohead is a passable band but lets's face it, they aren't doing anything that dozens of other bands haven't been doing for years. ""Kid A"" is pleasant sounding to a point but without innovation, message or charm. If you like downbeat electronica you would do better with Thievery Corporation or Low, to name but two. To name ""Kid A"" as one of the best of 2000 very poorly reflects on Amazon's critics. They need to get out more and listen to more music."
4,What a follow-up to OK Computer,"Mellow...very mellow, ""Dark Side of the Moon""ish. I enjoyed all of the tracks and Thom Yorke is very hypnotic. They really seem to enjoy their music and so do I. Lay back, get into a state and just think about stuff...ahhhh."
4,Stepping forward,"Initially I was disappointed by the lack of aggressive rockers on this new album, but after three listens, found it to be a pleasant surprise. Like Blur's 13, the ambient approach of Radiohead on Kid A created an album that can only satisfy the audience when heard straight through, from beginning to end. No singles, no breakout hits, just a good solid album for audiophiles. One of the best things about Radiohead has been following their progression from album to album as they avoid the pitfalls of commericalizing their artistic integrity."
1,Am I missing something?,"Why the big fuss over this band? Have people suddenly developed a passion for thin, whiney off-key vocals, or is it the droning lifeless song-structure that some find so appealing? Aren't we tired of angst-art rock yet?"
1,The Emperor's new clothes,"It was with great anticipation that I bought this CD. I'd heard The Bends and enjoyed it. I'd read the reviews, which seemed to be universally enthusiastic in their praise. I was massively disappointed. This is musical navel contemplation. It seems that you open yourself up to sounding obtuse by savaging this effort, but it was a huge waste of time. The silver lining is that it's only 40 minutes long or so."
1,Am I missing something?,"Why such a fuss over this band? Have people suddenly developed a passion for thin, whiney off-key vocals, or is it the droning lifeless song-structure that's so appealing?"
1,huge disappointment,"I had finally found the perfect band. No love songs & three guitarists....complicated layers of melody/harmony etc. I waited for 2 YEARS for a new issue from musicians that always put me in a state of AWE. I bought KID A. Listened to it 20 times(on headphones, in the car, alone, with others, etc. I hated it more and more. I love it more now that I have 1) converted the disc into a very stylish clock & 2) purchased all the expensive import stuff by radiohead that I didn't have before. I wish they hadn't become so ordinary in their attempts to be different."
1,Do not buy this album under any circumstances,"If you put a couple of randomly-chosen fourteen year old boys in a modern studio with professional engineers and told them that they had to write and record an album in one day, odds are you'd get something much more entertaining than this (...). It's hard to imagine something so repetitive could be so completely devoid of melodies, yet here it is. I wondered why something so critically acclaimed would not receive more radio play until I listened to it -- believe me, this is not something you are going to enjoy."
3,Good,"This is a good album. Kid A does continue in the direction the previous three releases have laid down, I just think that this one may have been a bit to ""Head"" and not enough ""Radio""."
1,Pretty Bad,"Yeah, this is pretty bad. I could use an electronic keyboard and sound more innovative than these people. Radiohead relies on really boring electronica to make their bad music more interesting. It works for a couple of minutes, but then you realize how stupid it is and you just shut it off. Kid A is simply the epitome of Radiohead's very bad music. Happy listening! P.S.-Did you see their ridiculous performance on ""Saturday Night Live""?----Ha! Ha! Forever."
1,But... I thought I was buying a Radiohead CD.,"Wow. Never before has a band dropped so low so fast. OK Computer was one of the best albums ever produced, up there with Dark Side of the Moon. But Kid A is such a completely unlistenable waste of time that it angered me to sit through it. At the end of every God awful ""song"", I hoped that the next song would be a fantastic peice of musical artwork, since I know the band is capable of it. Instead the CD just got more and more lost in art-school tripe. This is quite simply the worst collection of ""music"" ever assembled. Unless you are a blind, obsessed Radiohead fan, DO NOT buy this CD, DO NOT download it for free, DO NOT waste 45 minutes of your life listening to it, you cannot get that time back. Listen to Pablo Honey, The Bends, OK Computer, heck even the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack, but please do yourself a favor, and pretend this album was never released. You'll be glad you did.*The More You Know*"
1,Kid zzzzzzzzzzz,"Kid a is pretentious, self indulgent, downbeat and boring. I hear it's suppose to be experimental and innovative, but it's the complete oposite. It's safe and simple techno music for beginners. This could be mistaken for an Aphex Twin demo tape if it wasn't for Thom Yorkes high pitched mumbling."
5,A Great Album,"I am not going to try and make myself out to be one of the many wanna-be music writers that try and concoct their own analysis of lyrics or what a band should have done, because to be frank most of them are totally full of crap. Lets be honest, Radiohead is a great band that during the 90's put out 3 great albums.... hell they were beautiful albums. This most recent effort has got to be their most beautiful. Was I sold the first time I heard it?.... No. But I wasn't all that crazy about ""OK Computer"" the first time I heard it either. I cant wait to here what they have to offer next."
3,Kid A,"Kid A could be considered a real step down from OK Computer. The songwriting has suffered a bit due to the electronic interplay. This album seems to focus more on interesting atmospheres and textures more than individual songs. Some may feel this is a positive thing and just the artistic statement that Radiohead was trying to make. Me, i think they should focus more on their songwriting. Radiohead is still one of the greatest bands in the world but they should put more effort into individual songs instead of just weirding us out."
4,It holds up with repeated listening,"I've read a lot of reviews that said Radiohead was in a ""no win"" situation when trying to follow up OK Computer. I think they've clearly won. To me, Radiohead is all about the mood their music creates, and about finding the little nuggets of beauty buried within the recordings. This album is loaded with them, and while the music may not be instantly accessible, upon repeated listening the melodies begin to creep up on you and take hold. The bass riff coupled with the excellent in and out drumming on National Anthem has locked into my mind today. Yesterday it was the beautiful Morning Bell.This album is different, but really not THAT different. If you liked The Bends and OK Computer which were very different albums from each other, you'll like Kid A. If you're a Radiohead fan, you won't be disappointed."
4,You don't get it?? Good!!,"It would appear that our good friends Radiohead have pushed the envelope successfully. Any fan of the band would know that the bar was raised quite a bit from The Bends to their best OK Computer. In the case of their new album, Kid A, Radiohead takes us to outer space and keeps going. So you liked OK Computer but think this is tripe. Good. You are obviously not a fan of all of music's possibilities. Kid A starts with the slinky ""Everything In Its Right Place"" complete with lush analogue keyboard sounds and Autechre-esque bleeps and blips. Knowing these sonic magicians, most these keyboard sounds are probably made by guitar. While it is a slower, interospective album than previous offerings, it still remains in the great headphone tradition of Pink Floyd and Eno. Sonically mesmerizing!! Nope, it won't make your local mainstream ""alternative"" radiostation playlists. But you shouldn't be listening to that garbage anyway."
3,scribbled,"The music on ""Kid A"" seems to echo the art work found on the sleeve. A collage of different elements glued and taped together. Radiohead seem to be reaching here for something new as any ""true artist"" does, not worrying about reviews and pleasing the general public, but taking risks. For this reason ""Kid A"" isn't as immediately pleasing as previous efforts. It may take time for it to grow on me but for now it seems like transitional effort. They are not gods nor rock saviours, just artists following their hearts, hopefully."
2,Kid A,"Let's put it this way.Giving it the ""edit playlist"" test. If I delete 3-4 songs from the continuous program loop, the album is listenable and somewhat interesting. But that is where the problem is. As I have not felt the need to edit the playlist on any of the bands previous efforts. So yes I am disappointed and believe it is a step backwards for RadioHead.To be honest I kind of like guitars and vocals. And this album has hardly any. Straight synthesizer and tape loops for the most part. The pendulum simply swang to far off into left field on this CD. With only brief flashes of the bands previous brilliance on display. A very average CD from a very talented band. But in all fairness perhaps I just expected to much after OK Computer.So in conclusion, I suggest you walk, not run, to buy this CD. Cause your not really missing anything extraordinary by not having it. And it probably won't be sold out anyways."
1,They call this music?,"This is definitely the worst thing I've ever heard. The only song that is remotely decent in my opinion is Idioteque, but that gets dull after about one listen. I got this CD as a gift, and I was fortunate enough to be able to return it, even though I had taken the plastic off. (I didn't know anything about it until I got it, so I thought it might be good.)"
1,Worst music I've ever heard,"These guys stink. Don't buy this CD. It's awful. The first track drones on and on and on... and it doesn't get any better. It's as the adults say, ""all down hill from here!"""
1,insufferable and self-indulgent,"I don't care what any of the die-hard fans say, this album sucks. If you're expecting any kind of reasonable follow-up to OK COMPUTER, look elsewhere. Gone are the moments of beautiful vocals and anthems you can immerse yourself in...this is the kind of album I would listen to back in art school and pretend to enjoy. Do yourself a favor and pick up something like RED STARS THEORY new release, ""Life in a Bubble Can Be Beautiful."" It at least strives for sustained moments of blissful listening. RADIOHEAD won a grammy and now they need to prove to themselves that they're not mainstream, and we, as the audience, are forced to suffer through a full-length CD which will be quickly forgotten. If this were their first release, it would also be their last. Letting this trash grow on you simply means you've accepted the idea of lowering your standards.I'd give it zero stars if I could."
2,"OK Computer, NOT OK Kid A...","Este CD es tan aburrido. Sonidos experimentales y canciones sin melodia llenan esta produccion, para nada comparado con su trabajo anterior, OK Computer. Realmente no vale la pena adquirir este CD."
3,Pretty decent,"OK computer sounded like nothing I've ever heard before in that it projected an edgy, futuristic ambiance. Maybe it was the measured precision of every sound on the album. Kid A is pretty decent and interesting but they're more like artists splashing paint on a canvas now without as much attention to detail. I guess they got tired and eased up a bit. In places Kid A sounds more like an IMax soundtrack than rock but it's still good to listen to, mostly. The first half of the album can grate on your nerves if you've been up too long. The 4 minutes of nothing at the seem to fit in with the rest of the album... nothing awe inspiring but artistic"
5,even my dad likes this,"i must say im very proud of the old man. once i game back from school to visit i saw he had bought kid a and ok computer. reading some of the other reviews i can see why you would get insulted if you were told that you just didnt understand a certain piece music i'd want to get in a fist. so maybe you just dont have the patience. one reviewer made references to looper and aphex. i do think looper is a good band but even if radiohead is ripping them off there doing a much better job than looper. i only think one song on this truly sounds like aphex twin and thats kid a. thats actually my favorite song on the record. as a whole i think its a great achievement. if you close your eyes and forget there are any other bands on earth i think you'd like this. try not to compare too much, especially if the music is this good. beautiful stuff. one of the reviewers said that some of these songs are b-sides. are you sure? love this"
4,Amazed,"After the let down of OK Computer I was a bit skeptical of Kid A. The first couple of listens I was scratching my head in wonder. Then after a few more listens it hit me, this album is great. Buy it!"
5,KID A+,"No drop off from OK Computer. Radiohead confirms their place in the top strata of modern rock bands with this release. Follow their directions, and listen to this from start to finish-pick a dark room for the setting. It does not disappoint. Reminiscent of Pink Floyd at times, reminiscent of nothing at others. It's a masterpiece."
4,Don't overrate or underrate KID A,"Gosh, I love Radiohead. Their music is like a drug. You can't get enough of it.When I die, I know their music will be up there in heaven."
4,Kid A,"Kid A being Radiohead's 4th studio album and their 2000 release is a very experimental album that can be called both alternative rock and electronic music. The album met with mixed reviews but was a massive hit in many countries. The album peaked at #1 in the UK chart, Billboard 200, Ireland, Canada, France and in New Zealand. The booklet is very avantgarde and contains no lyrics and many strange paintings. I am very impressed by this album and it is one of the better albums that I have heard for quite some time. 4/5."
5,Great Album and Fantastic Artwork,"While this has no additional songs, the album is enhanced!! Artwork is amazing but I would not recommend this to anyone who is a casual fan though."
3,PLEASE PEOPLE,"I am sick of reading reviews that say ""...and those who don't like this album obviously don't understand music at all...""That is so...wrong.Regardless of how great an album is (and I don't really think KID A is all that great), it is composed of nothing more than various arrangements of notes and sounds. You are not hearing anything that the rest of us are not hearing. If you get a lot out of the album, good for you. If you don't, there's nothing wrong with you. Everyone has different opinions, and insulting someone who doesn't ""understand"" an album is...stupid."
5,How To Disappear Completely.,"There are few bands that can touch Radiohead. With each cd, Radiohead has set new standards in engineering, arranging, singing, playing and producing music. ""Kid A"" sounds something like you'd hear 100 years from now or while your shuttle is taking off into space. Or it could be the background music for a mortuary, something haunting, something you'd hear in the afterlife. This time out, the band experiements with synthesizers more than guitars, with song form and structure. The subject matter is entirely Radiohead's: alienation. There are excellent songs here like ""Everything In Its Right Place"", ""Kid A"", ""How To Disappear Completely"", ""Idioteque"" and ""Motion Picture Soundtrack""--which this cd could also double for. Not a note goes wasted, for the most part, on ""Kid A"" except for the song ""The National Anthem"" which doesn't sound like it quite fits into the song cycle. I look forward to hearing how this band will metamorphosize in the coming years."
4,21st century Radiohead,"This is a great album (it took long enough to get here) and I think that its a must for electronic, and rock fans alike. I would have put 5 stars, but there is no way it has the forward thinking and creativety that OK Computer showed the world of music. You knew technology and the digital world was going to influence the album, and that fine.I really have enjoyed hearing it, and I suggest purchasing on Vinyl while its still available, I have seen ok computes for 50 to 60 on ebay because of the limited pressing #'s."
5,Masterpiece,This is the third greatest album to ever be released in the history of rock and roll.(Next to Ok Computer and The White Album.)If I ever stop liking Radiohead it may be because I have gone retarted or I've developed a serious illness.
3,Post rock meets analog ambience,"I think very few have hit the target with Kid A. As far as sound and structure goes, Radiohead's follow-up to the landmark OK Computer basically draws from Post-Rock influences, a valiant attempt to bring this genre to the surface. Other than 'The National Anthem' (which closely resembles Primal Scream's 'Shoot Speed Kill Light') I was immediately struck by 2 distinctive Post-Rock features, (a) the techno Aphex Twin/Mouse On Mars type of arrangement and sounds, and (b) a Gastr Del Sol/Jim O'Rourke approach to structure and subtle use of noise. I can really hear the Gastr Del Sol influence all throughout the album. Kid A might sound very alien and experimental to many, but Radiohead may have been aiming for Post-Rock's Sgt Pepper, and in retrospect might have succeeded."
2,one good song.,"I was tempted to give this disc more stars just for being different, but then I thought more about it. Its different, but only among bands that are popular. If you want meandering sound-scapes, which make up much of this recore, than there are a dozen lesser known bands that do the job in more interesting, and in the end, more fulfilling ways. With the exception of ""How to dissapear completely"" (a masterpiece of a song), this disc left me cold. But maybe, in the end, that is the point. If they recorded this to communicate the coldness of this technical world, then, well, great album. But if you want that same message in song form, try ""the sophtware slump"" from Granddaddy."
3,Slightly less than OK,"Yes, I know. They are Radiohead and this is a savvy move. Thom is fully cognizant that he could not match the dirge for the modern world that was the last album. So take it somewhere else. Smart move, boring direction. Not even sure the rest of the band is needed here (syntesizers though, lots of synthesizers). Is it horrible? No. Is it worth getting? maybe, but if you must have it why would you listen to anything anyone said here? And it may grow on me but it will never be as good as I had hoped. And by the way, the Bends is their best work."
3,"Very dark, mysterious, intricate, unique","I just bought this album because it was supposed to be something out of the ordinary. Critics hailed this cd as a masterpeice, so i decided to check it out. The album has a very dark feel. The Music, the booklet, everything. Yet i dont see how this album could be called a masterpiece. I have listened to it over and over trying to feel Yorke's genius, but just couldnt. Some songs it sounds as if they are playing with a sound machine. But I think people praise this CD because it is so out of the ordinary. I wouldnt reccomend this album to anyone that loves the mainstream, but it is an alright album and does offer a few good tracks. This is just one weird album."
5,"more electronic than the others, but classic radiohead style",Its a great CD. I have to admit that the songs on OK computer grabbed my attention a lot more but I think they built on top of the OK Coomputer foundation and just went a little more into the electronic realm. I like it though.
5,a soundtrack to the new century,"Goes to show that in this day and age of mindless pop and boy bands,a group can rise above all this,that band is the mighty RADIOHEAD!!! Kid A is like a futuristic leap into the protential of what interesting music can be.Radiohead has set anew standard in music kinda like what pink floyd did in the 70's. The music is interesting,intelligent,and not for the masses...I can't picture teeny-boppers and macho rap-metalheads getting into this(AND THAT IS A GOOD THING!!!)BUt,if your looking to find a higher calling in music,this my friends is the ticket to the stars. JUst buy,listen,and you will understand!THom Yorke is god!!!"
3,a review from an average joe,"This album is not for the impatient. You have to sit down, relax, and be able to go through some seemingly boring moments to get to the gold. Some of this album, in my opinion, is border-line pretentious. I mean, lots of it doesn't even have a melody. It just kind of wanders. I think this album can be compared to the album Adore by the Smashing Pumpkins. I'm not saying I like it as much as Adore, but as far as leaving the strats for the piano and acoustic guitar it is very similar. I'm not the biggest radiohead fan to say the least. I'm sure all radiohead fans will love it. Bottom line: if you are tired of the same old guitar riffs and want to listen to something fresh, buy the album."
2,"Yeah, I know you're going to buy it anyways.","I want to set things straight in this review. So many people seem to think people don't like Kid A because it is electronica/ambient with very little rock. Either that, or they just have bad music tastes and don't like Radiohead. I, on the other hand, like Radiohead, and I have much respect for the band. Yet that still can't dissuade me from writing this review. People should be warned before they pretend to like this album for a couple of weeks, and forget about it. To be honest, it lacks any kind of energy. Listen for 30 seconds and you'll get the feel for the whole song. There is plenty of creativity and experimentation, but that fails to breath life into empty songs. Oh, and for those people who call this the Album of the year: just wait a month or so, then you'll be able to admit that its not very good."
2,Not a single hook. (Their first bad album),"I'm an avid Radiohead fan. Until now its been hard to find fault with the band that singlehandedly reinvented the guitar, has a one-in-a-million lead singer, and sings some of the most poignantly beautiful songs I've ever heard.So what's wrong with this album? For one, the band clearly believed too much of its own press. In an effort to break new ground and bring us the latest greatest concept, they apparently forgot what they really are: Pop musicians. Great pop musicians.There are plenty of great vintage synth sounds on this album -- but there's a little too much exploring, and not enough basic songwriting. What has always drawn me to Radiohead is that in their explorations of new musical territory they still manage to pull out some incredible pop. But not this time...Radiohead needs to head back to the studio and work hard to remind us that they can still write songs. And that they can rock."
5,Grows on you and then never lets go,"Different from OK Computer-- jarringly so at first. After a couple repeat listens and some time, however, it started becoming my favorite album. It doesn't necessarily have a few radio-friendly tracks that you can sing along to like in The Bends or OK Computer, but it's an amazing listen from beginning to end. If I were trapped on an island and could only choose a few CD's for company, this is a must-have."
4,Radiohead,"Not a bad album, but I'm still not completely sold on these guys. You see lists with their albums ranking close behind great albums like Abbey Road. Well this album is good but doesn't quite rank up with the Beatles. That being said, the opener is a good layering of studio effects with a nice groove. The big theme is Thom Yorkes politics and concern about the retreat of the Polar Ice caps. On Ice Age we're treated to a good electronic beat with some chilling synth effects.The other plus about this album is the fact that despite the bands rising popularity they continue with their experimentation with sound and new exciting instruments."
3,A Rainy Night In Georgia,"This is the best acid jazz album I've heard since Vanilla Ice's ""To The Extreme,"" that itself a profound tribute to Uncle Meat by the Mothers of Invention, with a little more keyboard. When I heard ""How To Disappear Completely,"" I was severely disappointed because they never told me how to disappear. I thought they had the answers, but instead I heard about how isolation consumes people. I already knew this. Overall, a good follow-up to the jungle funk of ""OK Computer."" Their forays into psychedelic bluegrass on ""Amnesiac"" were much more surprising. I'm gonna go listen to Tusk now."
3,It's ok,Ok Computer was the first album I heard by Radiohead. I thought it was great. I had heard a little about Kid A and thought I would like it because I am also a fan of electronic music. I just finished listening to it for the first time and I really dont like it that much. The melodies arn't very interesting and it isn't as emotional as OK Computer. I thought it was boring.
2,13 BUCKS FOR ONE SONG,"I love Radiohead but this album is good only as background music while working or driving. The music is not worthy of paying full attention to. This kind of work has been done before by Brian Eno and Robert Fripp/King Crimson. It may be good music to cut your wrists to, but it is worthless for anything else. I think the band tried really hard but it is really important that they go back to their real strength and genius which is the intertwined and beautiful guitar work that they are capable of. The only reason i gave them 2 stars is because there is one truly great and beautiful song and that is ""How to dissapear completely"" which is a lovely work of genius."
3,I love Radiohead but I don't love this album,"Radiohead are one of the best bands of the late 20th/early 21st Century and do deserve the accolades heaped upon them to great degree - few bands in recent memory --regardless of assigned gere-- have delivered consistently great albums over a career arc spaning aprx. a decade like they have. But, I'm sorry to say, Kid A misses the mark that OK Computer and The Bends --the two albums which immediately proceded it-- set, not because it's a departure from what was concidered their signature sound up to that point, but because it has a number of really good songs but they don't cohere together in the context of an album as well as their previous two masterpiece albums. I appplaud the fact that they were attempting to explore new musical territory but Kid A comes off feeling like a sketchy prologue to the far-better Amnesiac which was released barely a year later. For me, Amnesiac is what Kid A wanted to be but didn't quite acheive."
4,Terror Filled Emotions on this CD,"In Radiohead's Kid A, I found it to be realy earie and on an emotional height, unlike alot of the music out there (Back Street Boys, Britney Spears, Nsync etc.) In ""How to Disapear Completly"", the singer Thom Yorke takes the listener into a dream where one can find themself walking through walls and flying. Most of the tracks on the CD are like this, with some kind of ambient soundscape that make you feel as if you were in a dream, in heaven, or just on acid. I gave this 4 out of 5 stars for I wish it had more tracks, but it probably realy deserves 5. So to sum it all up, if you want good music to drive, to do homework, to do art, and even to listen to while a sleep...BUY IT! You won't regret it."
5,multi-faceted musical gem of genuine modrock,"it took them long enough to put out a new album since OK COMPUTER, but KID A is so amazing... so very amazing... i listened to it once with my best friend's diabetic cat and he loved it too. so... it's really good for just lounging around in a dark red room. especially red."
2,Half-decent album,I think reviews from non-RH freaks are much needed here!....sure radiohead is a good band with balls and artistic integrity...but this time one must admit they almost blew it. Roughly half of the track are decent....the other half is junk or fillers....could someone honestly think that treefinger is not crap? What about those 3-4 minutes of silence in the last song....sorry guys but this artistic statement has been made countless time before.....enjoy the silence?....please! Morning bell is a decent song but for those of you who think the drum is genius....well listen to closer from Joy Division and you will hear that exact same beat. I think this album is kind of an adverse reaction to the stardom they were forced into following OK computer. In summary this album has been completely overrated...it's sad when hardcore fans can't admit their group had somewhat of a failure.
2,Is the Emperor wearing any clothes???,"Talk about a disappointment. After having ""The Bends"" and ""Ok Computer"" permanently installed in my CD player for the past few years, I was eagerly awaiting the next release. What I found--wandering, aimless techno-noise, minutes of near-silence, backwards-sounding vocals derivative of the Stone Roses first album from 10 years ago--made me want to run to the nearest used CD store to turn it in. I am completely astounded by the critical ravings. Maybe I'm just not cool enough for this stuff anymore. I don't care. It bored me senseless."
2,Weak Effort,"I just don't get it. I just listened to The Bends and then went back to Kid A. It just doesn't match up. The melodies are just not there, the ringing acoustic guitar lost to sound loops. The emotion of their previous albums is just not carried into this album. Kid A is a good album, however, not the classic that I expect from an act like Radio Head."
2,noisy scrathy vinyl,Great album poor quality fidelity. Very scratchy noisy unlistenable. Song selection and flow of album is worthy of the grammy it received. Wish the vinyl was better.
2,Please remove heads from Radiohead's arse,"I know everyone likes a little experimental rock now and then, but this album was experimental for eperimental's sake. Radiohead has forgotten that it's all about good music, not just being rock pioneers. I was disappointed with the album as a whole, although there are some good tracks (motion picture soundtrack,everything in its right place). I like radiohead just as much as anyone, but the credit they are given as ""rock saviors"" and best band ever is just hopping on the radiohead bandwagon. I will hop on as soon as they remember how to make good music like i know they can."
2,Retro Prog-Rock Bombast,"I find it fascinating that the critics who found the masturbatory musings of Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes and other seventies progressive rock outfits so offensive seem so smitten by Kid A. This album is twaddling self-indulgence on a galactic scale. Radiohead, perhaps influenced by all the ""best band in the world"" nonsense, is clearly beginning to take themselves too seriously. OK Computer ranks as one of the great rock albums of this past decade. Kid A is interesting background music for those on high-grade hallucinogenics, but very little else."
2,"Not quite OK. OK, Radiohead ? DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY","Working hard for my money, I don't enjoy being let down by a group trying to experiment all the time (I should have know better) OK, Computer opened new grounds on the rock arena, but KID A sucks. There is no Karma Police, no Exit Music to a Film, no No Surprises. NOTHING. Electronic sounds, silly landscapes and programming ... you call this rock? Give me IRON MAIDEN!The booklet (""limited edition"" and all) is total junk (no lyrics, no photo's, no innovative drawings as on OK,Computer) and just goes to show that there is such a thing as ""overexperimentating"".I must also say that after a while one starts to get used to it (my first instinct was to take it back), even gets interesting, in fact I can understand why some call it revolutionary. (Don't compare with Pink Floyd, PLEASE!). But WHY all the effort, when something like Mark Knopfler immediately goes well on the ear!?!"
2,Completely Overrated,"I wanted to like this album. I really did. Many people are saying how they have ""reinvented music"". That's a load of rubbish. There are a few interesting odds and ends, but overall the album is just not very listenable. Radiohead has made great music on their past albums and I think most people are grading this album on past accomplishments. It's mostly pompous, overblown noise. Sorry."
2,"""Good Night Irene....""",The only reason to buy this CD is so people think you're cool when they see it in your CD holder. This CD is boring......Don't listen to those pretenious bastards who write how great this CD is.
1,Most disappointing album ever made,"Sure, it must have been hard to follow up two of the greatest albums of all time, The Bends and OK Computer, with anything like those in quality, but they could at least have tried. Kid A is absolute rubbish, full of synthetic sounds and incoherent, and when they are discernable, pointless, lyrics.If Radiohead wanted to experiment with new directions before settling back to what they do best - good, tight, guitar-filled emotionally charged rock - they should have just kept it to themselves, instead of releasing it and conning us loyal fans into paying good money for c**p like Kid A.In the history of music there have been worse albums made, though not many, but there has never been a worse album made by so talented a band."
1,The first Radiohead work I've raised an eyebrow at,"As someone who considers himself a die-hard Radiohead fan, I immediately ordered this album the instant I heard about its upcoming release. Upon its arrival, I rushed out to the car to give a listen.Sadly, after forcing myself to leave this disk in the changer for the past four days, little of it has grown on me. Things start off nicely, with the eerie soup of ""Everything in its Right Place"" recalling much of the feel of earlier works, with some new textures. A perfect song for brooding while driving really fast. But from there, things mellow into an eerily calm, unemotional stupor. C'mon Thom! Is someone slipping you guys valium/prozac? Where is the energy, the ""bite"" of the music we've come to expect from Radiohead? For the first time ever, I'm disappointed."
4,New Level of Brilliance,"Kid A is what music should be: creative, innovative, and just emotionally draining. amazing. Radiohead has impressed me yet again with this new record, and I eagerly await the following next month. It's outstanding, my favorites being How to Disappear Completely (and never be found), Everything in it's Right Place, Idioteque, and Motion Picture Soundtrack. The only reason it didn't score a 5 star is because Thom York, being one of the most amzing vocalists (like Ed Kowalczyk of Live) needed to sing more. Highly recommended for the patient people out there. Not for the simple minded."
2,radiohead: saviors of rock?,"No. No they aren't. There is a fine line between experimenting and wanking. Ambition and pretentiousness. Good music and bad music. On ""OK Computer"" Radiohead somewhat admirably walked that line, but on ""Kid A"", they've fallen flat on their faces on the wrong side. The worst part is that they've blinded the music press and their own fans with their contrived expectaion-dodging antics.Okay, maybe that's not really fair. I'm sure there are people who do REALLY like this record. Indeed, a couple songs work, ""Idiotheque"" and ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" being two standouts. But look; all of this has been done before, BETTER. LFO, Aphex Twin, Autechre... hell, buy a Warp sampler and you'll get a much better version of ""Kid A"" with a copyright date of ten years ago. To say this is innovative or even foward-looking is pretty naive. If anything, it's retro.Thom Yorke really needs some ice for that swelling head of his."
2,This sounds more like RADIODEAD.,"Radiohead released one of the most interesting albums of the last decade but, unfortunately, in trying to throw the critics (whom they pretend to ignore) for a loop, they've created an album that is utter BLAH! PLEASE....someone grab Thom by his scrawny little shoulders, shake him and yell ""WAKE UP."" His constant mumbling throughout the album sounds like he has an English sausage stuck in his mouth. And the band...well the band really doesn't play(like we know they can). There is a lot to be said about minimalism, but if we wanted ethereal, we could have listened to Brian Eno."
3,Kid A - the experiment continues,"i have to agree with the ""non-professional"" critics - the only thing thing that makes this cd is the fact that it's RADIOHEAD. in the last thirty years others have taken me on the experimental trips to other musical worlds similar to this. Bach, Alan Parson's Project, Third-Stone-from-the-Sun Jimi, Vangelis, Todd Rundgren, and others that left me and never came back. i'm sorry, but the professional critics have overrated this, i guess simply because they want to support RADIOHEAD's experiments. and that's ok. i've listened enough times to appreciate the trip out of my ordinary musical world, but it doesn't leave me wanting more, just curious where the experiment will go next."
4,I had a hard time with this,"I think Radiohead is a ingenius band. Pablo Honey and OK Computer are both masterpieces for UK Rock, and music in general, but this album is dificult for me. OK Computer is certainly a hard album to follow, so in trying to be objective... This is a creative masterpiece; unlike anything before it. I believe this will spawn entire new types of Rock music; however, I'm not used to it quite yet. I have given it a number of listens and I find it deep and interesting, but somewhat depressing (not that Radiohead has ever been very uplifting). As though I really have no idea what the music meant (I suppose I didn't really know on their past albums either, but at least I thought I did).So after my list of random thoughts I will simply say this is a creative masterpiece, and must own for music lovers and Radiohead fans, but it will probably not sell like OK Computer, and if you just want more Karma Police, or Creep, you should look elsewhere."
3,comments,"It's pretty much impossible to describe this CD, and I think it's safe to say that it sounds like no other album ever has and probably like no other ever will. The band seems to have abandoned traditional songwriting techniques completely, and the songs are not really songs at all, but more like photographs or something -- you don't always understand what's going on, but you can make out colors and shapes. (The music matches the cover art perfectly.) You have to admire the band for daring to release something so different....BUT, being different does not equate with being good (a fact that many music critics don't seem to understand). And, when stripped to its core, KID A is not really such a great album. So I would recommend this to someone who wants to hear something truly different and experimental. But to someone who seeks a good album full of solid songs that will stand the test of time, I would point them in another direction."
4,A great follow-up to Ok Computer,"OK Computer, Radiohead's last CD, was in my mind one of the best CD's of the 90's. Radiohead has set another precedent with Kid A, a well rounded and thoroughly inspiring CD. the tracks on this release are distinctive, yet the album still maintains a cohesiveness that is subtle but evident. the minimal use of guitars and incorporation of Moog like synths, horns and other instruments shows the originality of this group as well as their multi-instrumental talents. some tracks remind me of Darkk Bros. in their experimentation of grooves balanced with chaos...my compliments to the band. if you are a musician you'll have a particular interest in this CD. thumbs up!"
5,radiohead review,"Its all about tracks 4 and 10... anyone who would even think of reviewing this poorly is a schmuck.... this CD is amazing, you just have to be in the right mood for it..."
5,radiohead is gr8,"Next to ""98 degrees,"" I would have to say this album is the quintessential sonic experience...Complex, intelligent, intense and very self-aware."
5,the lull sheets of heaven,"as to be expected, there's a great diversion between the customer reviews of the new Radiohead. ha. now it's easy to distinguish between those who DO and DON'T have a fraction of comprehension of music. this album, it left me breath-taken.. i couldn't sleep for a week, you see. Kid A does more than influence emotions, it brings images, thoughts, desires, smells, and especially touch. as ""How to Disappear Completely"" brings to reality a mask of heaven in where everything moves slow and melodic. this isn't just beauty, it's the closest thing to divinity i've heard in a long long while. and once again i'm envious of Thom Yorke's radiohead."
2,Overrated Album of The Year,"Although most discs reviewed on this site seem to get a 4 or 5 star ""THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!"" review, I'm going to break stride and Kid A is a good album with which to do just this - and for good reason. I liked OK Computer quite a bit and was prepared to like Kid A as well, but even after repeated listenings I don't hear anything here that really makes me want to come back for more. I mean, I'm trying very hard to like this album! But essentially, Kid A is an album with maybe 2 songs containing something approaching a memorable melody. The rest is electronic filler. I would recommend not buying into some of the pretentious reviews posted here claiming Kid A is ""terrifying"" or ""groundbreaking"" etc etc...it's filler."
5,A perfect piece of self-elimination music,"The long-awaited follow up to the band's most acclaimed work, Kid A is one of the biggest gambles in the history of rock. So many expected Radiohead to pick up the arena anthem torch previously held by U2 and Pearl Jam, and instead, they make an insidiously perfect electronica album.The ominous hum and gibberish lyrics of ""Everything in its Right Place"" throw down the gauntlet in the first 30 seconds of the record: either follow us where we're going, or you'll be left behind. If you follow, you get to experience the chills of a concept piece whose concept is really unclear: is it merely an album about depression and self-hatred? Is it political? Is it about the end of the world? It's entirely open to interpretation, but one thing it isn't is simple. Radiohead as we know it today is defined by this piece, and they aren't looking back."
4,Interesting departure from the norm,"However, nothing really original as with OK Computer. Influences echo direct from Brian Eno and Aphex Twin. Good listen though."
5,Probably my favorite album ever.,"...One day at school I saw my friend had a copy of Kid A and I asked to borrow it after being intriuged by the art within the booklet. I had never really heard any of Radiohead except for the song Karma Police from OK Computer. When I got home I listened to the cd all the way through and was totally thrown for a loop. I couldn't believe that such amazing music could be produced during my lifetime. The album perfectly flowed through each track, it felt as if I was hearing a story of alienation and frustration that I knew all too well. Thom York's lyrics are distorted and put together perfectly with melodic and repetative hooks that feel as if they are speaking on their own. I'm not going to sit and break down the album because several people have already done that, but let me say this: Kid A is a masterpiece, and definately one of the best albums of the new millenium. I suggest that any lover of music purchase this album; it's about the only thing worth $16 anymore."
3,Blueprints Of Amnesiac,"This album has much in common with Amnesiac. Though it is as if it is an unfinished version of Amnesiac. I don't understand why many people think it is better than Amnesiac, because I don't see why. It doesn't have much to it, except some music backrounds simular to Amnesiac. I can bearly remember any song s on it, because they just fade into the sounds of a silent room. The songs are substanless, and bland. It is more like an instrumental album, which is why it got 3 stars instead of 2. The music is beautiful. The Morning Bell song on this album is not as good as the one on Amnesiac, either. This album plays out like blueprints of Amnesiac, or some sketches of it, and is only unfinished and not as organized or flawless. I strongly recommend buying Amnesiac over this one, it is lyrically, vocally, and musically superior to Kid A. It is still good though, just a slightly disapointing when compared to Amnesiac."
4,Radiohead reinvents themselves; make a masterpiece.,"When Radiohead finished recording, touring, and promoting Ok Computer they were sick of being Radiohead. So they entered the studio, stipped away any memory of a past self, and built themselves from the bottom up once again. The result was Kid A.Undoubtedly one of the best albums of the year, it shocked fans at first listen because it sounded nothing like the Radiohead that swept the world over with OKC. They had created a sonic adventure that was unprecedented. They created a classic.Through Kid's 10 tracks the listener is taken through a starry landscape (""Everything in its Right Place"" -> ""The National Anthem"") and brought back to ground in crashing fashion (""In Limbo"" and ""Idioteque"") while never leaving the home base.I've never seen neither a shooting star nor the aurura borealis but if/when I do, I hope I'm listening to Kid A."
2,"Well, maybe 2.5 stars","Certainly a band deserves credit for exploring new styles, and deviating from what they may be ""expected"" to play. Bearing that in mind, Radiohead's Kid A is a noteworthy, if unsuccessful foray into ""electro-minimalism"", or whatever you want to call it. It sounds to me like Radiohead changed direction simply because they were afraid of trying to top the incredible and more unique OK Computer. While the ""new"" sound is successful on certain tunes, others suggest that Radiohead possibly hurried the ideas onto tape under the guise of minimalism.If you liked Kid A, or even feel that it fell a little short, try some of these artists (and realize that Kid A isn't the unique masterpiece some will make it out to be): Aphex Twin, Brian Eno and Bjork's ""Vespertine"" are generally conceptually stronger than Kid A. Or go further back into electronic's roots and listen to Kraftwerk, Neu! or Suicide. Those not averse to classical music might find Philip Glass rewarding."
2,"I Hate To Say It But ""Amnesiac"" Is Much Better.","I say a video show a while back that devoted their half hour to all videos of ""Radiohead"". Most of them were from ""Kid A"" and ""Amnesiac"". I watched it because I was curious about the group and their music. I bought ""Amnesiac"" first because there were more songs I liked from that album then ""Kid A"". I thought that this would be just as good, but I was really disapointed. There's only four really good songs on this album in my opinion.""Everything In Its Right Place"", ""How To Disappear Completely"",""Optimistic"", and ""In Limbo"". Eveything else didn't seem like a song to me, just attempts at ones. ""Morning Bell"" isn't bad, but I liked the version on ""Amnesiac"" better. If your new to ""Radiohead"", I'd suggest getting ""Amnesiac"" before this one."
1,Drive down Woodland Avenue in NY....,"If you drive down Woodland Avenue in Long Island, you might find a cracked Radiohead Kid A album somewhere along the side of the road.I absolutely love Radiohead. Their work on ""The Bends"" and ""OK Computer"" was amazing. I was expecting a change from Radiohead, as was pretty much apparent because they like to change their sound, but this album is utterly pathetic. The album cannot boast one very good song, not even one.This album is a collection of melodramatic, cosmic sounding rubbish, which sounds more like a B-Sides album than a major studio release. I gave this album time to grow on me... I had it in my possession a few months actually. After finally coming to the realization that this was one of the worst highly anticipated albums of All-Time, I broke the CD in half, and threw it out my car window. That may have been a little extreme, but it goes to show what a big Radiohead fan thinks of their new material. That is how disappointed I am with ""Kid A""."
4,"Shocking, yet origional","When comparing *Kid A* with Radiohead's other three albums, *Kid A* is certainly the oddball. True, it is done in that famous Radiohead style, but many of the tracks are truly experimental. ""Optomistic"" and ""Idioteque"" are about the closest there is to any resemblence of their previous 3 albums. I give it four stars for both suprising me and for outstanding origionality. The pace of the album is a little slower than I would have liked it to be, but Thom's vocals are very good."
5,Radiohead just keeps getting better!,"With Radiohead's new release Kid A, it will be brought to all previous fans attention that Radiohead just keeps getting better and better. Most fans dig the low profile that Radiohead tends to keep. Very rarely hearing an album track on the popular radio station is a turn on for us fans. So, Kid A will none the less tease your senses in the privacy of your own home instead of booming out of car windows just to annoy you. The ever-changing melodic and rythmic controversies of instruments and Thom's beautiful, unique voice carry on conversations with each other that will only please you who can appreciate the originality of a genuine band that will undoubtedly stand the test of time."
2,"Forget OK computer, lets go back to the bends, pablo honey","I heard this album for the first time sitting in a gym at college in between acts of a really good show. I didn't know it was radiohead. I remember thinking ""I wish they would turn this off and the next band would start."" That is pretty sad, and I have a feeling that if others of you had first been exposed to this album this way, you wouldn't like it... because you wouldn't be obligated to like it just because it is radiohead. I have loved this band with all my heart and soul for years. And at the time of The Bends, they were the greatest rock band in the world, but they have just plain lost their claim to that title. OK Computer had some beautiful moments, heartwrenching,emotional songs, but I can't even find anything human on Kid A. There is nothing with the raw, affectual power of ""Lurgee"" or ""Sulk"" of days of yore. So, don't buy this album, you'll just be buying into the big joke that is the radiohead of today."
2,only Radiohead can get away with this [stuff],After trying to get used to the new project I can't find much to enjoy aside from maybe three tracks. People are calling it artwork but if that's what I wanted I would buy some Picasso. I was looking for music and Radiohead failed to deliver for the first time ever. No one would have produced this garbage had it been another band but Radiohead does it ... call it the album of the year. I think I'll just keep listening to OK Computer.
2,"pretentious, pretentious, pretentious","Amazing these days what passes for ""important"" records and music. There are no songs on this record, just ideas, as someone else wrote here. It's fun to watch people fall all over each other rushing to praise this latest example of an emperor who isn't wearing any clothes...sorry, but I just can't join the cult."
1,Horrible,"Like many, I got swept in the massive radiohead fandom with the release of OK Computer (great album, by the way). I liked what I heard and my interest had been sparked, so I further investigated this band. I bought ""The Bends,"" the album they had released prior to OK Computer, and found that it was mostly pop-junk music. So I figured perhaps they had became disillusioned with mass-marketed pop-crap and decided to make something that sounded a bit more creative, yet was still uniquely pleasant with OK Computer. But I believe they've gone a bit too far with the creativity in this latest album, Kid A.The album is an inconsistent cornucopia of harsh, distorted sound waves. Now matter how many times I listen to it, I can't seem to like it. It really is quite bad. Any thoughts? Write your own review."
1,Reclamo,"Nunca me llegó mi vinilo de Radiohead, Kid A, no sé a quien reclamar. Podrían ayudarme, por favor? Muchas gracias."
3,How to dissapear completely from the mainstream,"If you see a lot of Radiohead fans waiting already for the band's next effort, it has to be because Kid A sounds more like a collection of B sides and less like the follow up of their masterpiece OK Computer. This CD is practically meant to be heard from beginning to end, leaving only a couple of tracks with the possibility of success on the radio. This is quite wonderful work, but not at all user-friendly. The band may have to analyze if they're quitting commercial rock for good if they keep in this direction."
1,What a disappointment!,"I was ready to truly love this CD. I love so much Bends and OK . This is so pretentious is disgusting. They forgot the golden rules of great rock music! Experiment with sounds, Instrument, arrangement not with melodies! There is nothing on here that has been done before and much better by artist like Bowie, Eno or any German avant-garde bands from the seventies."
4,The Blueprints of Amnesiac,"This album has much in common with Amnesiac. Though it is as if it is an unfinished version of Amnesiac. I don't understand why many people think it is better than Amnesiac, because I don't see why. It doesn't have much to it, except some music backrounds simular to Amnesiac. The Morning Bell song on this album is not as good as the one on Amnesiac, either. This album plays out like blueprints of Amnesiac, or some sketches of it, and is only unfinished and not as organized or flawless. I strongly recommend buying Amnesiac over this one, it is lyrically, vocally, and musically superior to Kid A. It is still good though, just a slightly disapointing when compared to Amnesiac."
3,good cd,"good cd, a natural progression for radiohead. takes some time to get used to, especially the national anthem.take it for what it's worth.."
1,artsy-fartsy crap,"alright folks, we need to quit listening to the artsy-fartsy critics trying to tell us how ""revolutionary"" this album is. These critics had led us to believe that it is so amazing that if we do not appreciate it, it's due to our own ignorance for art-rock. After making myself listen to this album just to find some redeeming quality, all I could dig up was the studio musicians they hired to play real instruments, only so they could play with it enough to make it slightly less distinguishable. The lyrics are repetitive, and his voice, quite annoying. Now if the words contained in the booklet underneath the disc-tray were the lyrics in the songs, This would be a wonderful CD, instead it's his whiny voice droning over some electronic noise they must have concocted in just a few hours."
1,Don't be too optimistic if you buy this cd.,"I love Radiohead. I mean, they're just awesome. But then came the sad day when I purchased ""Kid A."" I was listening to it on my discman on the way to school. Man, was it horrible! To me, it sounds kind of like techno, except for ""optimisic"" and you know, that song really isn't that great. Well I guess if you like techno music this cd isn't too bad. But if you really appreciate Radiohead and their deep, meaningful lyrics, you'll probably dislike ""Kid A"" as I did. And if you've never heard Radiohead before, just buy their old stuff, it's way better."
1,SO SAD - TOO BAD - THIS IS WAY OVER-RATED!,"Wow! this is soooo disappointing! Kid A is not the sound of a band evolving - it's the sound of a band that everyone feels can do NO wrong! When that happens you get records like this one. Full of slickly packaged concepts that are marketed as NON-slickly packaged concepts, very clever indeed. The majority of this album lack any focus or even any artistic goals. One could say that is the beauty of it - HOGWASH, that my friends is a lame excuse for this lame excuse. Kid A gets a Kid D-. (The songs Optomistic and Treefingers are pretty good)"
1,groundbreaking? give me a break,"if you want a textbook example of what is wrong with the state of music today, purchase this album. if you want to hear good british rock on the other hand, go out and buy oasis or suede."
2,Sheep on drugs,"What is the problem with Radiohead ? Well Radiohead fans of course, no matter what awful music this group produces people will still go out and buy it. If you think the sound is new and innovative, it's not. Aphex Twin has been making the similar kind of music for years. I think with a good record deals music like this sells, gets into major magazines and TV slots. I am not an (...)retentive person that dislike electronic music, but there is just a great deal of electronic genres out there that pushes the boundaries far more then Kid-A I suggest something like Download, Aphex Twin, Psychic TV..."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This music is meaningless and has no personality. Its funny how people call it ""innovative"" when it is anything but that. The vocals are horrible, and the lyrics are so pretentious drivel that they almost sound painfully like someone trying hard to be intellectual. There's no enjoyment to be had from this music. It does nothing to stir the soul. Its void and vapid. It has not real emotional connection to human hearts. Its made just for the sake of impressing people with something proposed as new and hip. Hipsters may like this piece of garbage, but I find it better to put it in the trash where it belongs."
5,Rock circa 2027,"Kid A was way ahead of its time when it was released in 2000. While not as highly regarded as OK Computer, it is an infinitely more rewarding, and therefore challenging, masterpiece that requires multiple listens, if not years of familiarity, to truly appreciate. Even now, Kid A sounds like a classic album released decades too early."
3,It's OK!,"A definite progression (they make some nice/interesting music without guitars) for the band, but that doesn't deride the fact that the SONGS for the most part, aren't quite up to snuff.There is NO denying that this is a bit of a let down following Bends and OK Computer.Still good though."
3,Kid A is innovative .... to Radiohead fans.,"Listening to 'Kid A' is a lot like eating a lobster! You may have to sift through some unpleasantries; it can get rather tedious, but there are some delicious bits. Several tracks ring true with the kind of creativity and attention to detail we've come to expect from Radiohead ('How to Disappear Completely', 'In Limbo') but the electronic-oriented tracks (i.e. 'Idioteque') are disappointingly derivative. Sorry, guys--the Warp/Rephlex artists have perfected this sound since the early '90s (and are far better at it!). On a side note, I seem to remember an Oasis track entirely similar to 'National Anthem' that wasn't exactly lauded. Radiohead cult-members take note: listen to the Warp/Rephlex/Skam/etc catalogue and Talk Talk's more esoteric work-- you'll hear _innovation_ back when it occurred."
5,Great Follow-Up to OK Computer....,"Three years is a long time to wait for a follow-up to one of the best albums of all time. Radiohead has succeeded again with the mellow, dramatic ""Kid A."" Less rock oriented than ""Pablo Honey"" or even ""OK Computer,"" this album is reminiscent of a very early, very experimental, Pink Floyd. The songs are melodic and mysterious, and gently lead the listener on a journey into a lesser explored genre of avant garde music. In a world of predictability and the boredom that arises as a result, this album is a refreshing reminder that great music still exists, and that true artists are never afraid of taking risks..."
4,to rob rindler,"Mr. Rindler, you answered your own ""I dont get it question"". You listened to the album a whopping 2 times? Any album takes repeated listens. This is a very good album. No, I am not a die-hard Radiohead fan, in fact, I dont really like their other albums. Listen many more times, if you dont like it, then you can say you've at least given it a chance."
5,This is not your father's Radiohead,"Kid A is an excellent CD, quite possibly the best I own. But it's not for everyone. If you're thinking of getting this CD because you're hoping it'll have songs like Creep or Karma Police, think again. This is an all-new sound for Radiohead, and that's a good thing. Radiohead has avoided doing the same thing over and over again, and with Kid A, they've gone a step further and totally reinvented themselves."
4,Its Good,"I like it. It is very different from their other CDs but in some ways but it still sounds very much like Radiohead. I'm glad some musicians try to do something innovative rather than ""go for the cash""."
5,Original!!! Ture art!!,Love the new CD. It's not just music but also ART. Thats very very rare with all this crappy music now a days. I dont expect some people to like it because people fear what they dont understand!!! But if you have a open mind you will love this cd!!!
4,Where do we go from here?...,"Let me begin by stating I was never a fan of Radiohead. That was until the day I heard ""OK Computer"" When preliminary reviews of ""Kid A"" came out, the majority stated that RADIOHEAD had made themselves a ""space rock"" or ""space opera"" album. This is near enough true, but instead of being futuristic sounding, this listener finds RADIOHEAD giving a nod to the greats of the past. One can listen to snips of ""Kid A"" and head bits and pieces of Can, Kraftwerk, Magma, Gong, and even The Residents. I give this disc 4 stars because I am pleased to see a band with past hit records be brave enough to put out a completely non-commercial record. Kudos to the individual involved who thought it would be cool to put a booklet under the tray. Fans of Pablo Honey or The Bends will have a bit of a hard time digesting this one, but for adventerous listeners, this is pure manna. Be brave, and give this one a try."
4,unlike all radio head cds,"i have 3 of radio heads cd this one is very calm and distorted through the use of many drum loops, beats and infecitious distorted guitar it is a really good cd dont get me wrong i love radio head. everything is ok is probably the worst song on the cd but it is still good becuase of the simple factor the vocorder is used way to much and you cant understand what he is saying at all for the whole song and it was somewhat disapointing that way.i would have to say my personal favorite song on this cd would be idioteque it is probably one of the catchier songs on the album with its infectious beat and wicked synth/distorted guitar sounds. next to ok computer this is my favorite radio head cd its well worth every penny of the 15.00 dollars you spend on it and i hopwe you enjoy it like i do"
5,Beyond Understanding,"With Radiohead Kid A seems to be making an argument for existence that is beyond comprehension. The noisiness, the ""songless-ness"" all point to an idea of art that cannot be scientifically reduced and must be taken whole. This seems an obvious counter-point to the idea of ""better living through science."" To clone a person (Kid A) is an attempt to fix creation, to scientifically control life. Radiohead sees the result of this view as a formless and disquieting isolation--a fear that can only be expressed in mutterings and whines. The album art echoes these feelings (White in Romantic literature is often associated with the unconquerable, i.e.,Moby Dick. the mountains suggest the unconquerable--not to mention a tongue in cheek reference to there own creative peak. Good, brainy stuff."
4,radiohead changed my idea about music,"I never understood this album until I saw them live. You probably won't understand it either, at least until you listen to it many times. Most likely, it will never click with you, but if it does, it will open doors for you."
5,No Guitars?,"I started reading the reviews here, and something strange struck me. There are hardly any guitars on the album, and yet I had not noticed. Why? Because good music transcends its gendre, and Radiohead will always write good music. When I first heard OK Computer it sounded magnificent, but wierd. And yet 3 years later it sounds as comfortingly familiar to me as the Beatles. Kid A is a clear progression from OK Computer, the childs toy of Radioheads best song to date 'No Surprises' is echoed at the begining of the title track, and 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' can't help but remind me of 'Fitter Happier' with achingly beatiful music going un-noticed in the background. I can't help but get the feeling that a lot of people loved the bends, but were only pretending to like OK Computer, and are just downright confused by this album. Anyone who really 'got' OK Computer will love this album. It will take time, but then Radiohead are worth the investment."
3,Good album but not their best. . .,"Sometimes I think a band trys to hard to get away from what they do best. This is that kind of album. I like it but I don't think it holds a candle to OK Computer, Pablo Honey, or even Hail to the Thief."
5,"Uh Oh, a band's evolving...","Where's my guitar rock? What happened to OK Computer? It's gone! This is in its place....???Some people listened to it, and others blocked it out.I can grab the guitar and play anything on OK Computer and get some cheers and some grumbles. Sing ""In Limbo"" off this album into any woman's ear and she'll melt. There's an eerie power behind the music on this CD. I heard originally the last track was supposed to much longer. I wish it was.If all bands evolved the way Radiohead did (That is, the overall change from the beginning album to the current album...not necesserily the same genre path), I would be much happier with music right now.Still one of the CD's I go back to constantly on the 400 CD changer. Has not died out on me in the least. Usually play it right after some early Talking Heads.If you like this album, I strongly suggest seeing this band live. They take these songs and change them, add things, delete things...you get mutations, and all of them are great."
5,Uniquely drawn,"This must be one of the best synthesizer albums to date. Its unique keyboard sounds and Thom Yorke's haunting voice give it the best blend. It's a step away from their previous efforts: ""Ok Computer"", ""The Blends"", and ""Pablo Honey"", which are heavier rock oriented. Their unique sound on ""Kid A"" seems to allow Thom to voice his expressions a lot more personally than before, and I have tremendous respect for that.Honestly, when I first listened to ""Kid A"", I hated it! Then about a month later, I listened to it again, first half one day, then the next half the next day. Listening to the first half, I still hated it but not as much as before. Then after listening to the last half, I was hooked. Immediately, I listened to it in whole, I was hooked to the whole thing! If you're not used to a sound as unique as theirs, your response may be the same as mine. If you stay with it and be patient, you will not be disappointed."
4,Brave New World,"The band continues its departure (that it started with OK Computer) from radio-friendly tracks. And that's a good thing. There's not a single song here, except How To Disappear Completely, that I could see getting any air time. The album begins with Everything In Its Right Place, a brooding song with distorted vocals that sets the tone for the entire set. This should be listened to all in one sitting, and preferably with headphones to pick everything up. Each track sounds better in the context of the whole, rather than taking one or the other on its own. Definitely one for true fans, not for someone looking for a hit single!"
4,evolution,"The cd is intense, moving forward from ok computer the band gets deeper and deeper into the society in which we all live. The music is everwhere as is our lives. Relating to this music is relating to everyday life, sometimes hectic, sometimes melodic but always changing."
5,The change will do you good....,"Man, what incredible growth this band has gone through. I wrote off Radiohead after ""The Bends"". Nothing up until ""Ok Computer"" did anything for me. ""Kid A"" is THE album by this band that turned my head and made me very much like this band. I would think if your alternative taste buds reach back to 70's Eno and Berlin-era Bowie you are gonna like this. It's funny, this CD was out a year before I heard it. I kept reading how weird it is, but I find it very accessable and interesting."
3,Not really so special or limited.,"I'm not arguing about the music. The music is of a standard unseen since the glory days of the Dorsey Brothers. It's that this is a very spanky package, no doubt, that pretty much any bohunk with a credit card can get. Thusly, there is nothing particularly Special Edition about it.If you love artwork, and artwork is as important as music, be my guest."
5,It just gets better.,"If it's possible, which it apparently is, Radiohead have made an album even more original and incredible than their last, OK Computer. Kid A swirls from genre to genre until the listener must conclude that it really is...as Thom Yorke intended...in a class entirely on its own, as indefinable as it is familiar to all those who have felt that Radiohead music beats to the rhythm of their own souls. There's more lyrics than I expected here--many of them simply repeated phrases or choruses-- but this is really an album that's all about the music anyway. Kid A is deep and primal and deserves to be listened to while in a reclining position, preferably in the dark, by yourself. It will take you into yourself, hopefully, in a really deep and primal way."
2,Radiohead Gets 'Different',"I've always loved Radiohead and the music they create. I've always overlooked their kind of arty pretense about music, but no longer. Kid A is by a long shot their most far reaching album, and one that tries too hard to be different. I realize they were trying to do something completely different and I wouldn't have minded had they done something of quality. But some of the songs could of have been written by my five year old cousin with a keyboard. Anyone can make ambiant sounds, but only a few people can write 'Paranoid Android' or 'Fake Plastic Trees'. There are a few saving graces, notably 'Optimistic', 'Idiotheque', and 'How to Disappear Completely', but not enough to save the album. I realize these are the only 'songs' to speak of, but they've given me nothing else. I'm sure some will hail this as the greatest album ever, but let's be honest, Ok Computer is a hell of a lot better than this."
5,Weird...Unusual...and that is why I loved it!!!,"From the school of Pink Floyd, Radiohead has challenged the music scene to break thru barriers. Pink Floyd began this quest well over 20 years ago, but rock music didn't listen. Maybe Radiohead can persuade the masses. This album IS NOT for everyone. Some will love and others will HATE it. Great headphone music. Very cerebral and surreal!"
4,Expected to hate it... it's great!,"Here's a recipe for disaster. Take a band whose fans are snobby to a fault, a band who could have been bigger than U2 simply by strumming a guitar and rewriting ""fake plastic trees"", but instead avoid hard earned success by dreaming up electronic soundscapes while the singer loads his vocals into a toy computer, scrambles it, and calls it ART.I delayed buying this album forever.... I'm a Bends guy, and OK Computer's paranoia has no appeal for me. This albums doesn't talk about paranoia and isolation, you actually are taken there sonically.I'm really impressed - I don't usually fall for Floydian sonic experiments, and headphones albums, but this record is absolutely intoxicating. I really love every minute of it.Obviously not for everyone. It's interesting that there are 1100 reviews of this album. If nothing else, it'll give you something to think over."
3,Kid A.,"I'd give this 3.5 stars, but 3 will do.I love Radiohead. I love experimental electronic music like Aphex Twin. When I heard that Radiohead did an album of IDM-styled electronica, I thought, ""This will be awesome."" I quickly went down to my local record store to take a listen.Well, it wasn't exactly ""awesome"", but it's good.I knew the music was obviously well-made. Critics loved this. I knew that the kind of electronica I love was exactly what they're trying to play here. I knew I should love this. Why didn't I love this? I listened to it over and over, and it got a bit better each time.It's not Radiohead's best work, and I'd probably say Amnesiac was just a little bit better. The problem is for every moment of brilliance on Kid A (like ""Everything In its Right Place"") there's a dud track (like the terrible ""National Anthem"".)"
5,Stuck on a desert island........,"If i were to be stuck on a desert island and had the chose of 5 albums it would be (in no particular order) Radiohead: Kid A, Pink Floyd: Dark Side of the Moon, Beatles: Magical Mystery Tour, Genesis: The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, and Mr. Bungle: California. Kid A is definetely the best album out this year.... in fact i'd have to say its the best album out in a LONG time .... as in the past few decades (with the exception of a few)..... its also the most original thing i've heard in a long time... plus it grows on you the more you listen to it."
4,Um...Different...,"Not entirely certain about this one yet. It takes a little work, but I give'em high marks for effort and avoiding safe choices and taking new directions etc. Dark and broody - if you're expecting Ok Computer or the Bends or almost anything else yer in for a shock. I think I like it a lot but I'm not sure it'll stay in my cd player for a year or two like the above mentioned did. But if yer a 'head head, ya gotta get it."
1,¿little Goldie influence?,"What happened with this album? What i want to know is how a talented group of musicians such as Radiohead can come out with masterpieces like ""The Bends"" and ""OK Computer"" and then come out with this. When i bought this CD i thought I'd hear at least something similar to the sound of Radiohead, but this is trach..techno trash..They have always been alittle techno..but they have just gone over the edge. The are hardly any lyrics and the ones that they do have are hardly Thom Yorke-esque. There is hardly any guitar..maybe one song..and way too much electronics..this has really made me think twice about the talent and individuality of this band. A very sad day for music."
3,Overrated,"Radiohead is overrated, period. People who say things like ""well I guess you can't appreciate good music, go listen to something simple"" just show how ignorant they are. I'm sorry but listening to Radiohead does not make you smarter. Radiohead is more just plain old weird than complex, and although they can make some interesting music it's nothing I would call ""genius"", especially on this album. Go pick up ""The Bends"" instead."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,Can you say nap time? This amazing band completely lost me on this album. It seems to be just a repetitive drone. What happend to guitars?
2,What the hell happened?,"First of all let me point out that Radiohead is an awesome band. I like ever album that these guys have except this one, and I haven't had the time to go out and buy Amnesiac, but i'm not optimistic. This album is a synthesised piece of weird music. Don't get me wrong i'm all for weird music, but I need lyrics. What happened to the strange appocalyptic ramblings from Ok Computer, or the angst ridden vocals of The Bends. I mean come on, expermentation is fine, but something good should come out of it. All I hear when I put this on is some really synthesised singing along with some excedingly not Radiohead type of music. I got one over used phrase for these guys, ""back to basics"". Thats what they need to do. The survives the one star infamy because Optomistic is an excellent song. It's one of their best. Now heres hoping these guys can get back to what they are best at, making great alternative music."
5,alien,"Its obvious .. This album is a bautiful work of art on its own, but not only does the album go away from what people expected after ok computer, it goes away from the primary fan base of radio head fans. Granted it doesn't leave everybody out in the cold, but I think it just upset the fans who now belive that another Ok computer will never happen. There should be plenty of new fans, expecially Experamental electronic fans, and the few Sigur Ros fans that didn't listen to radio head before now. Its a wonderfully textured and layer album with amazing songs .. a perfect ""what if"" as in what if Alternative rock had its own variation on trip hop. And what if thom york used his genious to craft emotionally charge electronic music. This album is highy underrated. And Deserves an easy 5 stars."
5,A Modern Symphony,"Not an album of 10 seperate songs, but a 10 movement symphony. Amazing. Best to listen to it in a dark room headphones on where you wont be disturbed. One of the most inventive and musical albums ever."
2,"Eh - ""Sentimental Drivel"" - High Concept [stuff]","This is the album that has come very close to ruining Radiohead for me. ""Amnesiac"" will have to be damn good to rescue my interest in the band. ""Pablo Honey"" was great, ""The Bends"" was exceptional, and ""OK Computer"" amazing, but ""Kid A,"" seems to be nothing to me except perhaps a subtle way to make fun of the record buying public... Is that why the album was originally going to be entitled ""The Emperor's New Clothes""? Because it's not actually there at all? If not that then Radiohead really [messed]up."
2,Like nothing they've ever done.,"This new Radiohead album is nothing like their earlier work. It has the slight electronica feel of their previous 2 albums, but the music on this album is not nearly as varied as any of their other albums. Kid A is extremely laid back, which is nice at times, but at 50 minutes, this is a boring listen. I recommend their first 3 albums, and both EPs (My Iron Lung and Airbag) before this album. Then, if you want more Radiohead, give this a spin. Just keep your expectations at the level of background music, (e.g. Enya, Eno) which is unfortunate since these guys have the ability to write songs that command your attention."
5,. . . AND for those who don't like it . . .,". . . you're missing the point. This is a great album. It is deep, introspective, and innovative.RAdiohead is a great band."
4,Worth the buy,"It's worth the buy if you're a radiohead fan, but it's not up to par with ok computer and the bends."
2,Less artsy...more fartsy,"This album is way off the deep end. Dissonant, endless jams with very little substance. I have loved everything up til now. Music for Aiports 2? I don't get the 2 minutes of nothing at the end of trak 10...This album left me annoyed and disapointed..."
2,what has happened to this band?,"not that i despise Kid A by any means, but after OK Computer came out, it seems to me that Thom Yorke could take a dump in a box and everyone would mark it ""brilliant."""
2,Kid A (limited edition),The music is BRILLIANT ... the limited edition artwork is NOT worth the premium price ... the packaging for the standard edition is far more interesting.
5,lemon or lime?,"Hey guys! do you think he really woke up sucking a lemon, or is it me? My boyfriend(yes, i am gay)told me that it must have been from a drink the night before like a gin an tonic, let's say.Well, anyhoo i just love it, it cheers me up"
2,What kind of air are they breathing???? if any,"Dear Radiohead and RadioheadersWhatever you were trying to express with this new CD if you expressed it as you wished, three cheers to you, but I must say that Kid A was a big disapointment to me. I think you would find it wise to your music your fans that love your music and yourselves to put away your computers your turntables and your London Symphony Orchestra and go back to your roots of being a Guitar Bass Drum Band, that was much more moving music, you don't need all the digital FX to get it all out...Creep Acoustic and Creep reg. was beautiful it makes me so emotional when i hear it but i'm not sure what Kid A makes me do except ask for my money back, sorry to sound dickish, but thats me.If I wanted Techno I would have bought Techno, i want Street Spirit Radiohead. Bring it back.Mikes"
2,unoriginal,"I'm giving Kid A just two stars because most of the praise regarding this album refers to its so-called originality. Maybe for most people who listen to nothing but mainstream music (i'm not making a judgment, just stating an observation) this is original, however, if you have ever listened to Aphex Twin, Haujobb, Delerium, Autechre, Orbital, DJ? Acucrack, THD, etc., it's obvious that none of Kid A is original and quite frankly, it's been done better. That's not to say that this is a completely terrible album, however, i feel that this is probably one of the most overrated albums ever and bands that have already made (better) music similar to this are getting seriously screwed over (but that's usually how the music industry works)."
2,"Thom Yorke, the Britney Spears of the art school","This time Radiohead has finally done it: created music that only spoiled white kids can understand. It is music that, had it come out ten years ago, might have been considered experimental. But they are not an experimental band. The only experiment they are doing is trying to make an album that sounds equally as good in their fans' Volkswagens as it does on their Imacs."
5,Radiohead's BEST,"The first time I heard it i was like ""what the hell....where's all the guitars???"" I really hated it when it came out. Divine Intervention caused me to listen to it again, and now i LOVE it. See, what's so great about this album is that the experimentation just blends beautifully with their music. Sure, a lot of bands have done it... but just take one listen to U2's Discotheque and realise that Radiohead is the one of the few band that truelly mastered this. And I LOVE IT, How can you say that OK Computer is their best album??? It's not, Kid A and Amnesiac are!!!Oh and THOSE ORGAN OPENING NOTES on ""Everything is in its right place"", ISNT IT THE MOST HAUNTING YOU'VE EVER HEARD????"
5,"One of the best ever, for its originality","Like most of Radiohead stuff, Kid A takes loads of listenings to be a benefit to you. The only difference with this is that it takes even more because it is so complicated. Its up to you, you can listen to Linkin Park's simple music every day that all sounds the same, or you can listen to this where every track is unique, clever and generally damn good when you get into it.I often find that songs which are harder to like end up being better."
1,save your money,"This is trash ~ they ought to give it away for free~ why anyone would pay anything for this is beyond me. Resembles a gang of infants who cut loose on a set of synthesizers. No musical value. For those who buy, do yourself a favor and take some aspirin before you play it, you'll be glad you did."
3,Ho Hum DJ Radiohead,"I enjoy musical experimentation a great deal, and experimental about sums up this effort by Radiohead. The cd is desperately lacking in the comprehensive fusion of lyrics & musical modalities that OK Computer possesses. All too often, while they do expose you to a unique listening space, the structures of these songs really take you nowhere. Even the best songs on the album, like ""National Anthem"" and ""Optimistic,"" don't deliver in a big way. The musical landscape is interesting, and listenable, but devoid of intention.I respect Radiohead for attempting something new, but experimental electronica is nothing new. MP3.Com, for instance, has a host of outstanding experimental electronica artists that, frankly, blow Radiohead's effort away."
1,Terrible stuff,"The nicest praise that can be levelled at this album is that it is different. Everything is in it's Right Place is almost unlistenable, with its splinters of Thom Yorke's vocals flickering in sporadically. The soft, keyboard atmospherics wear thin extremely quickly and are repetitive. After 10 listens, this album still doesn't hit, and there is not one song that I am going to put on my Best of Radiohead Mini-Disc. People who have been enjoying the album, answer this question: Do you truly like the album for its music and that alone, or is it only because it is a Radiohead release that you are prepared to accept it? In taking away the hype, forgetting which band released Kid A and concentrating upon the music alone, you are left with a very poor album indeed."
3,Kid A = Selected Ambient Works + Vocals,"This latest album is good, but not great. Aphex Twin already has produced this music already, time and time again- especially songs like Treefingers. OK Computer was far more original than this. That said, this is still a good CD, haunting and ghostlike in it's approach. It kind of dances around you like a phantom, instead of punishing you like ""The Bends"". It surrounds you like a lingering echo instead of poking you like ""OK Computer"".OK Computer is one of the top ten best CD's in the 1990's. Lets leave it at that. If you are just getting into Radiohead, try Computer before this one."
5,They've moved on,"A lot of people won't like this album because there's not enough guitars, or theydo funny things with Thom's voice. In one review I read they said that they replaced Thom's voice with ""avant sax soloing"" in the ""National Anthem"". To all of you who don't like this album simply becuase it doesn't sound like OK Computer: go to hell. I mean honestly they're trying to move on, and they did so beautifully. This album is incredible, the melodies are brilliant and the instrumentation is interesting. Don't think that you've ever out grown Radiohead, Radiohead has out grown you."
4,WARNING: Intellegent Music here,"This is the future of music. We, as music listeners, will look back ten years from now at this record and say ""Wow"". Radiohead have set themselves apart from the rest of the music industry by being honest and taking chances. They have defined for me what is smart music. Groundbreaking is one word that comes to mind. Right off the bat, the first track 'Everything in It's Right Place' is spooky, mysterious, and beautiful all at the same time. Also, the first three tracks contain NO guitar. They pull this feat off by layering sounds together to make music. Isn't that what music is anyway? Layering sounds together that make songs? I say yes. Warning to all ""Rock"" fans: This is not even close to a rock record. In fact, its the furthest thing from rock. It is just flat out good music. Pick it up and see what we are in store for in the future. The future is now, and the future is Radiohead."
3,Radiohead's got a new kid,"I realy love OK Computer, i think it's one of the greatest things done in the nineties along with NIN's work, and i wasn't expecting something in particular since Radiohead moved really fast with each album. I didn't like this the first time i heard it, i remember thinking of it as something Brian Eno or Aphex Twin could do better, but after listening carefully to ""How To Dissapear Completely"" i gave a sense of my own to Kid A. I don't love it more than OK Computer, but i really think it is necessary and it gives us something really different that this great musicians can do with their talents. I know that every artist has to move in another direction with every piece of work they do and in this case it resulted in a very eclectic piece of art, this is a fine example."
2,sound of future? nah!!,"have anyone heard of an album called passengers OS1?which is released by U2 5 years ago,and its even better then this one, i'm a big big radiohead fan from the bend,and they always bring suprise to me,but this time,i'm totally disappointed,coz they did something which has aready been done by someone else. and lets not talk about the ""alternative""thing.this one sounds basically annoying,and makes me keep going to next track and ask myself ""if there something better await there?""maybe they were searching something new during this album,maybe they will find what they will be,but to me,if the next album is something like this one.i won't listen to them anymore.purely disappointed."
2,IMPORTANT!,"This 4th album is even more important than their difficult 3rd album. It reeks of importance. Many rock critics who are desperate to champion ""the future of rock 'n roll"" are praising this album to the high heavens. So are a host of devoted fans. Me, I prefer ""Creep"" and ""The Bends."""
1,Would somebody explain this album to me?,"On the advice of several of the album's reviews, I bought this CD. Some have heralded this album as ""a return to music,"" or ""a much needed album."" All I can say to somebody thinking about buying this album is save your money because after listening to it about 10 times, I still have no idea what Radiohead is trying to do with this album."
1,"plug me ears, please","so bad, i can hardly listen. but i do, because radiohead is a great band with great records, and i hope to find something enjoyable about the record. very difficult to listen to, especially in the car. maybe bonghits may help, but for now incredibly disappointed. the art crowd, i'm sure, loves this record, but why, i'll never know. you don't have to say you like a record beacuse it pushes the envelope or because you like the band. remember ""wowee zowee"", my friends."
1,left over effects shouldnt make up an entire record!,"UNDER-achieving is back in vogue with this PRETENTIOUS - HYPED mess of an album! It is nothing close to the Bends or OK Computer - The songs (dare I call them that) have no structure. I have seen people say thats the beauty of it - Hogwash! If that were the case then nobody would even know about them, If it wasnt for albums like the Bends and Ok, then they wouldnt be in this self-absorbing position, because no-one would care. The song Optomistic is grand though too bad about the rest."
1,Very disappointing,"I've been a huge Radiohead fan ever since Pablo Honey and I have loved just about every song they have ever released.....until now. This is honestly one of the worst album I have ever listened to, and what makes it worse is we all know that Radiohead is capable of such greatness. OK Computer was certainly not what any of us expected but it was able to combine experimentation with the rock vibe we except from Radiohead. However, Kid A seems to take experimentation far beyond anything that could be considered rock or alternative or whatever you want to call it. Radiohead has said that commercial success has never been their goal and that is made abundantly clear on this album. They seem to have thrown the guitars out the window and traded them in for keyboards. Even the traditionally outstanding vocals of Thom Yorke are lost in the over experimentation. So unless you are a huge Radiohead fan I suggest that you pass on this one."
1,Horrible horrible horrible.,Every album they produce they get worse and worse. This album has to be the worse. Even though ok computer was great compared to others this one just really really sucks. I'm sorry for any fans to read this but it's horrible. It shows no talnet the singer needs to sing louder and write better lyrics.
3,Close very close,"Almost everything in the late 90's has been horrible. I sincerely hope 2000 encourages change -hopefully very soon . Radiohead almost has it. What through me off was the electronic drum (reminiscent of the break-beat sound I grew tired of in the middle 90's). I appreciate the departure from lyric-centric music, however, they are not bringing in anything really new.If their was no drum machine I would have rated this album higher. The drum machine has been beaten to death.National Anthem...One word ""Spiritualized""."
2,Dissapointing,"Most of the qualities that made The Bends and OK Computer great, such as great songwriting and musicianship are absent on this CD. Its almost like they tried so hard to be different from every other band that they forgot to write good songs along the way. Don't get me wrong. Its still better than most of the other CDs that are coming out lately. However, its really frustrating to listen to this boring, lifeless music, when you know they are capable of so much more. I hope they saved the best songs for their new one coming out in the spring."
1,I SHALL SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE,"Zero one one one zero one zero zero zero zero one one zero one zero one zero one one one one one one one one oneFOR EARTHLINGS, A CONTEXTUAL TRANSLATION IS DISPLAYED BELOW:the sound of a dying pig was used to impregnate your mother.I preferred their vastly superior album Zooropa."
1,Playability very low on my list,"After hearing the raving reviews for this ""breakthrough"" album, I decided to head over to the local music joint and pick up a copy. I popped the album into my 10-CD changer and climbed back into my car, eager to hear the phenomenal sounds everyone loved so much about Radiohead ""Kid A."" Within an hour I had sold the CD. This CD is, without a doubt, one of the worst recordings I have ever laid ears upon: quality is nowhere to be found. I had a notion to go home, drag the pots and pans out of the cupboard and see what I could come with because if Radiohead can sell this, I can certainly sell something just as bad.The synthesizers and warped sound of this band do not point to ""good music:"" in no way do they possess a solid sound. I have concluded that the only reason they have received the acolades for this album is because there is nothing to compare it to. The key to a good album is playability and this one has none whatsoever."
2,OVERRATED,"Simply put, Kid A is background music at best. I've read all the praise from the experts and wondered how good these guys really are. So I purchased the CD and to be honest, after giving it a listen 3-4 times, I cannot say these guys are groundbreaking or inspirational.Simply put, Radiohead is best suited for movie soundtrack music. If you like that sort of thing, knock yourself out. The only tracks that stood out for me were ""Optimistic,"" ""Idioteque,"" ""Morning Bell"" and ""Everything In Its Right Place.""One final thought, if I had to hear this kind of stuff over and over, I'd probably fall into a deep state of depresion. Play it once and don't touch it again for a few days."
2,"sorry, folks it's not that great","...Sometimes the critics are afraid they will look unintelligent if they don't say it's ""groundbreaking"" or whatever. I bought this album because I kept reading so many articles about Radiohead and I was interested to see what they had been doing since their hit ""Creep"" came out years ago. Doesn't seem like I missed much. I thought that a grammy nominated album must be something special - until I bought this album and remembered that Eminem actually won one.It's not that these guys don't have a lot of talent. It's just that when you put together an entire album of meaningless lyrics, distorted voices, and annoying sounds..."
1,Can't See What Everyone Claims To See....,"I may not be part of the select fans who see something worthwhile on this CD. Oh well, I re-listened to Kid A, and still consider it a major bomb by the so-called ""saviors of rock n roll"". They are?? No wonder rock is almost dead. There is no cohesiveness on Kid A, barely a memorable melody(Optimistic being the only melody I can remember),nothing resembling their epic rock songs of yore, just COMPUTER (DE)GENERATED GURGLE, and I wouldn't recommend if there was a gun pointed to my head. Big piece of RUBBISH by this ""former"" great band.....hopefully they'll recover....."
1,"ive just heard it, oh my god!","its awful. i know they were going for indevidualism and uniqueness but this is way o.t.t its just noise. id tape it for the sake of the two ok songs. if your expecting a ok computer, give it a miss!!"
4,kid a,i'm still not quite sure if kid a is as good as ok computer. but it took me awhile to appreciate ok computer as much as i do. maybe it'll be the same with kid a.
1,look what I taped together mommy!,"Just when I thought the Disco Biscuits album ""They Missed the Perfume"" was the worst album I ever heard (That claimed to be original), Radiohead released this. Ok Computer was just that, OK, but this album shows just how easy it is for mediocre musicians to pick up the label ""experimental"" to justify selling their meaningless meanderings to the public. I've tried to be open minded towards this group, asking my friend to play it for me on various occasions. Each time I can't help but want to throttle that whinny vocalist (He's NO singer) and ask the band just what the point is. They just go nowhere. Do yourself a favor, don't believe the people who Desperately want them to be the next Can, (This tripe will never be timeless, unless everyone loses their soul), listen to the Bends and appreciate it for what Radiohead really is-A bunch of whinny rich people who accidentaly wrote half an album of alright tunes."
1,Shock treatment,I have no idea how this makes it into the charts as a good album or a good band. Senseless is the key word. I felt completely (...) off after the first 15 minutes. I have only listened to it once and that will be all. Save your money.
4,As good as it gets... while still short of being great :-(,"Sigh. After more than 20 listens, I must admit that this album is not as good as I expected. Yes, half the songs are truly brilliant (Everything, National, How To, Optimistic, Morning), but the other half are either throwaways (Kid A, Treefingers), inferior to the live versions (Motion), or just simply ""okay"" (Limbo, Disco). All my favorites of their unreleased songs (Big Boots, Lift, True Love Waits, Knives Out, Big Ideas, Follow Me Around, ...) were left off--hopefully for a later date!If you've already got The Bends and OK Computer, and you just want something more, I strongly recommend finding one of their excellent EP's (Airbag/How Am I Driving?, My Iron Lung, Itch) before getting this one. And start counting down for album #5 in the spring (!), which promises to be a return to their usual guitar-anchored sound. (And finally, remember, Radiohead publicly supports Napster! So nap away!)"
4,Amazing!,"This album is simply amazing! Lush with layers of organs, synths, and tons of unusual sounds, this album far surpases OK Computer in experamentation. Definitely not their best melody wise, but the cd makes up for that with its bare emotion from singer Thom Yorke.The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it's lack of melody. However some may see this as a strength rather than a weakness."
3,"Do you own ""OK Computer"" yet?","Most Radiohead fans are crazy about Kid A. I have to admit it took more than one listen for me to really get into it. Even then, I'm not sure that this is their best disc - it's so experimental - just seems to fall short of showing what great musicians these guys really are. Kid A strikes me as something they did when they were fooling around and not quite serious. But again, some fans find great depth here and really relate to these songs. I don't think I've reached that point yet. That will take a few more plays.If this is your first Radiohead purchase, do yourself a favor and get ""OK Computer"" first instead. If you're excited about what you heard there, then feel free to spring for Kid A."
3,Secret Weird Booklet in CD Jewel Case,"I won't add my voice to the cacophony about whether this album is good or bad, future or the past, cop-out or risky, etc. etc. I just thought i'd let some people know that a special secret, equally bizarre little booklet of words and images (that seems to compliment the rest of the insert artwork) can be found by prying open the black plastic CD ""seat"" that holds the CD in the back of the jewel case. Just an FYI (i love eccentric little tricks like this....)."
5,"Wow, the best CD of all time.","Breathtaking, a must have for any one who claims to have even half decent taste. Listen to Idioteque and know beauty in its purest form."
5,The Best Album of 2000,"I recieved Kid A in the mail yesterday, and listened to it in it's entirety for the first time, and the second, and the third. I'm listening to it at this moment. I can't tear myself away from it. It is the most amazing album I've heard in years. I would put it above its predecessor OK Computer. The only album in the past ten years that I think could be better is Pearl Jam's Ten. I was skeptical about Kid A before I got it. I thought a Radiohead without a strong presence of guitars and without a strong presence of Thom Yorke's amazing voice would be lacking. As soon as I heard ""Everything In It's Right Place"", I knew Radiohead could still amaze with a different style. In the past 30 hours that Kid A has been in my possession, I have come to think that it is possibly the Sgt. Peppers of our time. It is revolutionary. I only hope that it will prove equally influential."
3,A very strange record.,"I'm not a big fan of Radiohead but i have heard many songs of them. My biggest favourites is ""Karma Police"", ""Creep"", and ""Street Spirit"". These songs is totally great. These songs is very strong and catchy, and very athmospheric, and has good lyrics, and good music too, whith some mixed sounds. And good lyrics to. i'm gonna buy the albums, ""The Bends"", and ""Ok Computer"", the best albums of Radiohead. Bono in U2-(big fan of them)- likes Radiohead, and thats a inspiration for me. Kid A is a very strange record, it has many difficult sounds, and is mixing techno whith pop and whith a little bit of rock, but mostly a poptechno record. This record can be very difficult to listen to. But it's a good album. Buy it. It's good enough. But it's a little bit overrestimated album. Thanks."
3,Good But..........,"This album is a trid diffrent from ok. Yet radiohead continues to change and influcence new styles. The only problem I have is how everyone is acting like they're the first to tread this style/bondry. I guess most people have forgotten sebadoh and proboly have never heard of Emperior Penguin which is what a kid sounds a lot like cept on vocals. But, hey it always takes the commercial band to wain everyones taste in style. If you like this I recommend checking out emperior penguin too."
5,Mood music,"I really like KID A... a lot. You can read all the other reviews for a break down on the musical style, or for complaints that it is not another OK Computer, or The Bends. Yes, it's true, KID A *is* different than Radiohead's other releases, but if you allow yourself not to be disappointed about that fact, you're going to hear a fab new record. I like the overall vibe of the album....or better put, the way it makes me feel when I listen to it. I hear a lot of different influences in KID A...Pink Floyd, Mogwai, and Komeda to name three. Like I said, you can read the other reviews to get a better understanding of the musical direction Radiohead took with KID A. I am simply writing this review to let everyone know that I dig KID A and it should be listened to closely. It will probably take several spins to sink in, but once it does, you'll be happy."
5,Simply loved it from beginning to end.,"Granted I'm a Radiohead fan, but I found each track a joy the very first time I heard it. You can call it ""experimental"", or a ""radical departure"", but I call it great music from a truly visionary band. I'll be listening to this CD for a very long time."
5,"Mixed feelings, but not from me","I would expect this to be a love or hate album, and the reviews so far confirm this. If you want radio friendly tunes, forget it, do not buy this album. If you want something that challenges you at every note, buy it immediately. I predict that in 20 years time, many trendy young bands will be declaring Radiohead to be a prime influence in much the same way many bands speak of the Velvet Underground today (even though half of them don't listen to it). My tastes mainly lay with artists such as Scott Walker, Laurie Anderson, Mitchell Froom, My Bloody Valentine, etc. If you appreciate these artists, I strongly suggest you try this album. It's a classic, it just will take a few years to be recognised as such - an album years ahead of its time."
2,ok - you can come out now,"Experimentation is great. But this sounds too much like we've dropped in on a selection of ideas that remain half formed.It's as if Radiohead have put out a work in progress. There are a couple of really good songs, but too many drift by. If any up & coming local band did this you'd think - ""lovely! - err.. got any tunes?"" Given the build-up? Disappointing. Next?"
3,A tough one to digest,"Radiohead seem to have ""overdone"" it here. Although the album is quite creative, it pushes too far in its dreamy, uncharacteristically ""weird"" state. Don't buy this if you are expecting an album that rocks. This CD is completely lacking the guitar and every song takes strange twists making it nearly intolerable in places. Only ""Optimistic"" and ""Morning Bell"" show promise. Sadly, this is Radiohead's first ""miss"" in their 10 year career."
1,What in the world is this???????,"HUH???? I was expecting music from this CD, good music, like most Radiohead music. But I listened to a track on this, and it sounded like something my 3 year old cousin was doing on her keyboards! And what was up with the vocals???? It was just mumbling and none of it made sense. The only two OK songs on this CD are optimistic and idiotheque. MY GOD this was disappointing. Radiohead is usually so good too.......:("
1,bleeps and bloops...,"bleeps and bloops, my friends, bleeps and bloops. Remember old modems, all the noise when they'd dial-up. That's Kid A.If you want SONGWRITING buy Radioheads first three albums, each of which is amazing."
2,Umm... bland.,"This for the most part, is tasteless. If you took ANY of these ""songs"" and put it on OK Computer, what would be the worst song on that album? I thought so. It's just not creative. As a musician, I know in my mind and heart if I'm making something creative, or just something different for different's sake. This is the latter. Call it avante-garde or whatever, I'll call it an ego-driven ""we-can-put-anything-out-and-they'll-buy-it"" piece of pap. Sounds like they took the easy way out. Lemme tell you, Radiohead and Tool are my absolute 2 favorite bands ever. At least I still have radiohead's old albums. This is good for mellowing out, but even then it's just not thought provoking enough. It's like elevator music."
1,Droning and Moaning,"fitter happier. more productive. if only this were true. radiohead must be some sad sad fools to make music like this. talented, yes. enjoyable, no. if i want to feel the way i do when i hear this, i can go to a funeral parlor. for the time being, i'll be anxiously awaiting the next weezer album."
1,The ??? point,Why? why? why? why?WHy are they the best? the yare one of the worst bands in hte world and one of the most overlooked bands...they are playing minimal post-rock and peaople are thinking that this is a new quiality in music not knowing bands like Can or Sonic youth...tragic but true.avoid KID A and avoid RAdiohead!
1,hands down the most boring album i have ever heard,"this album requires that you dont like music but atmosphere. to call this the greatest album ever is impossible. all this does is create creepy atmosphere, not identifiable music.in retrospect, this album [is bad]."
2,Radiodead 911,"Dude, like, this album was totally wack. His Basslines are totally repetitive. You'd think he was doing the same song over and over again. Obviously this dude thinks hes Wyclef, Limp Bixkit, and eminem wrapped into one. Im here to tell you this , you deserve to be wrapped and mailed to an asylum if you buy this album...Look for me in other ratings...MB"
1,Depressing headphone mush,"I've loved Radiohead up to now. When I played this CD I couldn't believe I was listening to the same band. All the virtues for which I've loved them before -- fantastic melodies, Thom Yorke's aching and beautiful voice, the band's raw ensemble power -- are either gone or so muted as to be feather-light, as substantive as fog. ""How to Disappear Completely"" offers some slight glimmers of beauty, but most of the other tracks are just derivative, meandering, unpleasant suicide-soundtrack music. Too bad."
1,This Album is simply horrible,"I love OK Computer as much as the next Radiohead fan, but that doesn't mean I automatically have to love everything else they put out as it appears many here do. Garbage is garbage no matter who puts it out, and Kid A is nothing but that. The truth is, if an unknown band put out this cd of noise no one here that gave it 5 stars would do the same. Sorry Radiohead, but save the experiments for b-sides...unless your goal was to alienate your biggest fans. Avoid this piece of over-hyped trash."
1,Inane warbling,"Unmelodic, discordant, mindless twaddle.I think the joke is on the listener here. Radiohead are trying to alienate their audience or are excercising some internal demons or something and unlike ourselves they have taken the liberty of sharing their misgivings with the general populace - very extravagant of them I must say.Saying this is a concept CD or whatever is just misguided code for I want to like this album cause I worship Radiohead but what I really mean is its crap and I barely ever listen to it! :)"
1,?,"If they are the best as some musicpapers are telling why they are playing such a crap like this?unexciting and really annoying.really i was hoping that it's different but in positive sense - AMNESIAC is so much better (And ""Ok computer"" too)the most overrated band in music world have made the most overrated album in the world."
1,DISSAPOINTED,"This new release from radiohead pales in comparison to ok computer. It simply lacks the melodies present in ok computer that are also absent in pablo honey and the bends. Whining unintelligeble vocals are alright if they flow with the music, but in Kid A, the music is just as whining and unintelligeble. Not worth the plastic it's printed on."
1,Dull as dirt,I can't get over how boring I find this album. I have tried repeatedly to get it and I just feel like something is missing.
2,i just dont get it,"what happened? where are the songs? i just finished listening for the second time, and it seems quite boring. they may have gotten alittle too full of themselves. almost 500 reviews and i do not understand any rating above two stars."
2,Kid A = a sample of Warp Records,"I went to the record store the day after the release to find out what all the hype was about. I came home disappointed and empty handed. I'm giving this album 2 stars not because the quality of the music warrants it and not because it ""sounds like Super Mario"", but it is more to spite all the music reviewers who are gushing over it saying how ground breaking it is. It's great to see that a mainstream band is using its plateform to release material that is challenging the status quo of popular music and judging by the responses of some reviewers, it is a little too challenging for some; but, the electronic side of this music is far, far too similar to that of the music put out by Warp Records 2,3,4 years ago, especially that of Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada. I wouldn't be surprised if Radiohead bought Richard D. James (aka. Aphex Twin) a box of twinkies and a new tank for producing Kid A."
1,Pure Trash,"This album is to music what Andy Warhol was to art -- a retelling of ""The Emporer's New Clothes."" For all its hype and great reviews, I found this album to be comletely unlistenable. The whiny vocals over abstract music reminded me of a Tori Amos concert -- no rhythm, no purpose, just an intense feeling that if this is where music is headed, I don't want to go."
1,Zleepy,"I have never been so disappointed before, listening to a new album. It's boring and hopeless. I heard that Radiohead is planning for a 'real' album again - then I will try my best to forget this one."
5,The greatest album this year,"It is unfair to analyze this record track by track. Like Ok Computer, it has to be listened to as one composition as a whole album, and lots of times. Every time you hear it you'll love it more and more."
4,what does it mean?,"this album although seems to be a bunch of giberish at points is somehow appealing. many have said they love this album simply because its Radiohead. i feel as though it is an interesting new turn into a new direction for the band. its not fair to compare an album to a previous one, so the 4 stars means 4 stars on its own. rumor has it they put phrases in a hat and drew them out randomly for the first track but that is just rumor. Ifyou are looking for something differnt, i mean different, in your playlist pick this up."
1,A Disappointment,"After having bought The Bends and OK Computer and loving them both, I picked up Kid A only to be fairly disappointed. I understand the band's desire to always break new ground but Kid A is a side of Radiohead I just can't get into. Strange, rambling, electronic experimentation just isn't my bag baby. A lot of the music on Kid A seems like endless, self-indulgent, electronic gibberish that just goes nowhere. Those of you who can appreciate Kid A, have a good time. I have to sit this one out."
1,"No new ground broken here. Been there, done that...","It is appaling to hear those who say this is new and original groundbreaking stuff. I don't think so. Just listen to Bartz, Laraaji, Vangelis, Larry Fast's Synergy, and Eno. These soundscapes have been explored and created before. Just because Thom Yorke mixes in some disjointed vocals and a bit of simplistic bass in there does not a groundbreaking release make! This has got to be the most pretentious, boring carbon copy music i've ever heard. A great cure for insomnia. The masses have been fooled once again."
1,Big Letdown from OK Computer...What happened??,"I was just exposed to Radiohead for the first time a few weeks ago with ""OK Computer"" after Amazon's glowing reviews... and was blown away by its complexity and variety of texture... certainly challenging by popular music standards... or the standards of any musical genre, for that matter.And on that wave of enthusiasm, I acquired ""Kid A""... so what is this... musically shallow Dance/Techno?? Were it not for the familiar lead voice, you wonder if it is the same band at all."
5,"not OK Computer 2, but very good nonetheless...","Not much guitar - lots of samples, synthesizers, and disjointed, digitally altered vocals. A soundscape of the end of the world. They could have created OK Computer 2, but they did not. This is experimental, often brilliant, and not commercially oriented - what else did you expect from the best rock band in the world (though this veers away from rock quite a bit)? I think its an album that will take a lot of listening before it is truly appreciated, but it will stand up to repeated listening, unlike most of the music being released today. I think it will be a good opportunity for the British rock press to beat up on Radiohead again, as they've wanted to since Pablo Honey and haven't had the chance to... its experimentel enough to turn off a great many. But it is good enough to please those who are willing to be challenged...I can't wait to keep listening to it, as it seems to get better every time..."
5,An Instant Classic,"I thought I had heard the absolute best in music 3 years ago, when I listened to OK Computer. Let me assure you all that this record represents not only an incredible follow-up to an already classic album, but also a revolution in popular music. With Kid A, Radiohead have chosen to abandon the path followed by ""mainstream"" groups and create a road all their own. Without a doubt, this is the most spine-chilling collection of sound I have ever heard, and it is also the most breathtakingly brilliant recording I have ever listened to. If you want to hear music at its most dynamic and original, then look no further than Kid A. It may confuse and even shock some people, but it will never disappoint."
5,Music for Kid A!,"It is quite uncertain whether the follow-up of Radiohead's 1997 release ""Ok Computer"" would surpass another musical ground it offered. ""Kid A"" is one of its kind and a true masterpiece! Radiohead returned with such grandiose! Many suggested a strong Pink Floyd influence in terms of creativity and concept. Even though its hard to ignore the very English whimsy of Syd Barrett what-if-he-stayed-in-the-band(Pink Floyd) on songs like ""The National Anthem"" But Radiohead stood completely original!Just go buy and listen to it straight as the first track suggests that ""Everything (is) in its right place""!"
4,"Still good, but not exceptional","Ok. Definitely not radiohead's best. They go a bit over the top on their outer artsy journey. Drooaaaning, mooaaaning, organesque, soaked up in depression, under a cloud. But I guess that's radiohead......Not the same power vibe that ok computer carried."
5,strange. .. but not in a bad way,"In this generation where being so HARD and so HEAVY was this big push it's unreal that this cd was ever made. Don't kid yourself, your a long way from the radiohead of yesteryear. This cd is extremely subdued and mellow. I listened to this cd with an open mind.. i'd never heard too much of the previous works of radiohead.. and came out with an eerie sensation. This cd is truly great. Radiohead has made an unquestionable leap in a new direction.. hell, good luck even trying to describe or name where they stand now! Kid A is a strange trip though some unknown world as bleak as the mountainous scene on the front cover. But it's a great journey. It's obvious to me that many people won't like this cd, because it just is THAT radically different. If your ready to explore your musical tastes and yourself, then plug in the odd aura of Kid A and drift away.. or be dragged away violently."
5,good....good,"this is an amazing and beautiful, as well as original album, and i was pretty shocked when i saw that it only had a 4 star rating. the flow on this album is great, and the melodies are beautiful AND existant! (some reviewers need to listen carefully). i had my doubts about this album, and i thought i wouldnt like it when it came out, but i think it is easily the best album radiohead has done so far."
5,to be great is to be misunderstood,it is very logical to say that this album doesn't conform with what one would expect from ok computer and the bends but it is great nontheless. i personally think mixing electronic music with classic radiohead sounds very cool. i don't know why they approached this album the way they did but it doesn't really matter to me. i've enjoyed this album.
5,Excellent head music! Mood altering!,"This, and THE CHURCH 'After Everything Now This', are my 2 favorite CD's of the new millenium so far. 'Kid A' is a very atmospheric, hauntingly beautiful release that has the ability to affect and soothe you. The music ebbs and flows into your consciousness, and is an example of atmospherics at its best. The pieces are very well written, and a good example of thematic segments that meander into various experimental alleyways! If you like good, well written atmospheric, layered music, check out 'After Everything Now This' by the legendary Aussie band, THE CHURCH. It is my other fave CD of the past few years, and delivers in spades if you're into atmospheric, psychedelic alt-rock. Cheers/Beers!"
5,Uh...What?,"I'm sure that was the response from the fans, who love The Bends so much, said when they heard Kid A. It's very shocking to see a alternative-pop-rock band from the 90's go into this experimental-electronic sound. It's very hard for a band to do it, but Radiohead did it flawlessly. I like that. The songs are a lot darker, even compared to Ok Computer. The National Anthem is by far the noisest Radiohead song ever. Treefingers is so strange and sounds like nothing's happening, but there is a great melody (download the extended version. It's really cool!). Morning Bell and In Limbo have very scary endings. I personally like the arpeggios in In Limbo. Optimistic has a sort of PJ Harvey sound to it, which I like. And Motion Picture Soundtrack is very good, but very short. So, you have about 50 minutes of bliss. Great album."
2,The Lowest of the Best,"Lets face facts,if this album was not by Radiohead the majority of you people wouldn't go near it. It is a lazy attempt to try something new but the ideas are stale and the overall effect is boring album. I think Radiohead have the potential to be one of the greatest bands of all time but this is a backward step in their evolution. If you want to hear this type of experemental concept executed properly pick up Low or Heros by Bowie. I also think that the fact that radiohead are planning to release another album so hastily can be seen as a sonic apoligy, and I for one are looking forward to forgiving them."
4,Another Great Album From One of the Best Bands Around,Well I've listened to this album several times now. After the first listen I thought it was interesting and maybe a bit annoying. I kept waiting for a song to jump out and grab me such as something that a band would release as a single. While this didn't happen I've begun to realize that this album needs to be taken as a whole. Resist the urge to skip tracks. Instead let it play straight through and be patient. I think many people would agree with me that some of the best albums out there didn't immeadiately get their attention.I've noticed some pretty whiney reviews on here from some people. If you want another clone of what's already out there then feel free to go buy another Creed album. A Radiohead CD has no place in a Top 40/Pop junkies collection anyway. If you decide to buy this CD then be ready for some truly innovative music.
5,"something different, even for radiohead","Many have said this continues radiohead's evolution. But you can't really know. The next album may have more of those wild but rare guitar riffs on the previous two albums. Anyways, for me, this album is like all of their other ones. The first time through i was thinking, ""pretty good, but a little odd."" The second time, ""now it the odd makes sense, and fits."" The third time, ""this is totally badass."" I ordered it before release, and ever since i got it delivered its been in my cd player. If i hasd to pick a favorite song, it would probably be the national anthem. Maybe because it has a that OK computer dark sound that i love. maybe because i play trombone. But don't get me wrong, i like all the tunes on Kid A just as much.All in all, its as good as the bends and ok computer, but even less rock n' roll. For huge rock fans like me, that takes a little getting used to. Only thing bad is that i may have to wait another 3 or so years for another album this good."
3,Supplementing my comment on mediocrity,"Another late-creeping thought. Many reviewers are straining to find depth of meaning (both sonic and artistic) and are comparing this album to minimalism. I wish someone would explain to this VERY well-read and well-learned person just where on this disc of background music are the indicia of true depth? Straining to find bleeding-edge artistic provocation in this middling album is like trying to justify a PhD's jargon-laden thesis... you reach for reasons based upon the author, and not upon the work itself.Please, gentlemen of Radiohead, I beg of you -- leave the synthesizers and soundscapers in Brian Eno's studio, and get back to making HUMAN music."
5,Beyond expectations,"This album is amazing, its everything I wanted to hear in an album and more. The songs/journeys/epics/whatever u want to call them are like noises in my mind which come together beautifully and take me away to a place where everyhting i want to hear, i am hearing. If drugs are illegal, this album should be banned from the shelves, because after listening to this i am high as a kite."
4,Nothing wrong with it. Nothing special though.,"Radiohead's a pretty good band. I've got nothing against them. This album is nice to listen to. There's some throwaway crud on here (Treefingers), but mostly it's a nice album with pleasant tunes. I like it much better than the hugely overblown OK Computer. I think I've already listened to it more often than I ever listened to OK Comp (which isn't saying much, actually). If you're looking for these guys to ""save rock 'n' roll"" or some such nonsense, forget it. They're just a band with a good singer and a knack for creating fairly memorable tunes, which is rare these days."
5,"Musical profundity, period.","""Kid A"" introduced a whole new musical universe to me. The album is replete with innovation: complex rhythmic schemes, abundant dissonance, and uncharted sonic landscapes. Add a beautifully haunting voice in the mix, and voila--a masterpiece results.BUY THIS ALBUM. But be forewarned, it isn't full of simplistic, catchy hooks that bring the ephemeral gratification of most popular music. ""Kid A"" (and Radiohead in general) is fine wine among a host of (...) libations."
3,its different,"as i grew up listening to pablo honey,the bends,ok computer this is definatly different but clever but unlike the other radiohead albums(including amnesiac) i have 2 be in the right mood but radiohead r still and will always be my favourite band"
5,"Some people will not like this record, but many will.","Well I just wanted to be the first to tell you that this cd has a lot of songs that I like, in fact nearly all of them. My favorites are first, a little song called ""kid a,"" which people will complain distorts Thoms fine sounding voice and thus is not a good song; for me, however, I am very moved by the part when thom says ""rats and children follow me out of town."" Another big huge highlight is song three, aka Everyone, The National Anthem; I get very excited listening to this song, especially when the ""jazzers"" kick in.This definetly isn't a typical UK electronic music CD. Don't try to compare it to other group's work because it is different.I could write more."
5,radiohead :im so happy you made another brilliant cd!,"before buying this cd i have to admit i was a bit skeptical. i knew a lot was expected out of radiohead as a result of ok computer, and i was afraid that like many other bands radiohead will take a slow plunge after a genius cd, recycling old material. well my fears were wrong as hell. this cd makes me love radiohead even more.with totally different music than ok computer, radiohead still make me feel incredible. this record is filled with electronic sounds, which add up with tom yorks voice to a masterpiece cd. surrealistic, moody, psychedelic, makes me know that I do have some serious mental/social issues and im not the only one with them."
5,Upon Further Review,"When I first bought this album I looked at it, thought it was naked, but was convinced by the reviews that it was wearing clothes. It isn't. I defy someone to put it in their car for a month, listening to it once a day. When I love an album, that is what I do, I had Unforgettable Fire in my car for a year. Too bad, I was looking for something as incredible as The Bends or OK Computer. Another album like this and I'm done with Radiohead."
4,Typical Radiohead,"Ok, first off this is nothing you'd expect from Radiohead. It's a lot like an experimental electronica album with just a track or two that remind you that this is Radiohead. But then again, they are the same guys who after a great debut album (Pablo Honey), released the radically different ""The Bends"" (arguably their best album) only to release the Grammy award winning ""OK Computer"" (yes, really!). Well, ""Kid A"" is as radical a departure as you're gonna get and it is enjoyable. Like anything else they've done, it'll grow on you. Trust me !"
2,They fell in love with sound effects,"OK Computer and The Bends were great, Pablo Honey was annoying, and this album falls somewhere in between. I realize that bands need to progress artistically but I just can't see Kid A as progress. (People in other reviews will probably point out that I ""just don't get it"") Well, they're right, I don't get this album. I don't understand why they chose to replace instruments with sound effects. There are almost no guitar or drum parts. Instead the songs consist of beeping and organ-type sounds. The whole album has a very bare and minimalistic feel to it.I do like the hip-hop beat on Track 8, Idiotheque, but that's really the only song I enjoy listening to. I apologize to those high-browed, pretentious reviewers that scorn people for daring to criticize this album, but I just don't get Kid A. Maybe they can explain it to me."
2,Who is RAdiohead?,Est-ce que j'ai manquer un épisode??? Un changement pas vraiment interessant... decevant
2,And this is a rock band?,"First of all, let me start off by saying that O.K. Computer is one of the greatest recordings on the 90's. Since I fell in love with that cd, my expectations were very high for this album. I was very let down! This is supposed to be a rock band. For a rock band they do not like to use too many ""live"" instruments. These songs seem to lack focus, and only two seem to even resemble songs at all! I am not saying that this album is not inventive, it is boring! One of the only things I find unhypnotic about this cd is the cover art."
2,What A letdown,"I was waiting for this album as soon as I heard they went back into the studio, only to find a piece of crappy ""art"". I loved all the albums previously and can say this doesn't even come close to a good radiohead album. There are a few decent tracks such as Everything in its right place, how to disappear completely, optimistic, and idioteqe. The rest just sounds like noise."
3,Doesn;t live up to the OK Computer Radiohead...,"...at first glance. some songs are hauntingly enthralling, like eveything in it's right place, and kid a, but others are almost tedious.the wonderful tracks that ""the bends"" and ""o.k. computer"" were full of seem to be missing here. i can't pop this disc in the car, and sing my lungs out to just, or sulk, or airbag. there just isn't a track with any REAL vocals in the old radiohead form. the album is almost instrumental.pick it up if you're a radiohead fan, but either way, it's not going to be your favorite RH disc."
2,An Insomniac's Dream,"What is this album? Dissonant noise? A joke? A failed attempt by a recording group? It's all three of these statements wrapped into one overproduced album. A casual listening to this album brings frustration and the air of background music. A second listen with headphones will put you to sleep. Thus has to be Radiohead's weakest effort, a pointless prog rock epic about sucking lemons and failed efforts. Personally, I liked the ambient genre before Radiohead tried their hand at it. Buy it for the album art and the cellophane that accompanies it."
2,They lost me,"I like the band, and I'm sure I'll check out their future albums. However, Kid A was just a little too ""out there"" for me. Many of the tracks hardly even qualify as songs. Some are just collections of incoherrent electronic noises and voices. It's quite a departure from past albums. Unfortunately, for me, it was an unwelcome departure.I don't mind it when bands progress, but Radiohead has pushed the envelope a little too far this time. I'll keep listening to OK Computer until they come out with their next release. I'd advise all but the most hardcore fans to do the same"
1,"Corporate rock, not avant garde","More boring empty pomp rock from the Genesis of the 90's (Pink Floyd?- In your dreams!). Supposedly a move away from the stadium bombast of their previous corporate rock efforts, the posh, priggish Oxford schoolboys do little to disguise their wanky prog rock self indulgence, despite a vain attempt to court analog keyboard sounds and delay effects just like Stereolab and all their clones have been doing for the past 8 years. Have these guys any shame!"
4,"Good, but not ENHANCED","I bought this version thinking it was the real enhanced version, but it wasn't, and I also thought that it would came with the hidden booklet, but same thing, it didn't. Good CD but it's the nornmal version of the real thing."
1,Liam was right...,"Man, I don't know what all the hype is about this band. I listened to this lamentable dreck and it bored me to tears. It sounded like something to drop ""X' to. Note the high sales rank - next year this terribly boring bland nonsense will fade away and everyone will thankfully forget about it. If Liam and Noel ever get their acts together, they will easily surpass this mess. Liam was right, Radiohead sucks."
1,Complete Rubbish!,"Perhaps I am not in tune with the new artistic movement that everyone is praising this album for, but I think the album is rubbish. Pablo Honey and The Bends were great albums. Songs like: ""Fake Plastic Trees, Think About You, True Love Awaits, and Paranoid Android"" are what I like to hear from this group. I suppose ear pleasing melodies and structured lyrics are yesterday's news. I just hate to see groups through [stufflike this] together just to sell more albums."
5,Kid A modern masterpiece,As I read some reviews for Kid A I realize that some people are very stupid. If people say Kid A is no good that only because they dont get it. Kid A is a album in which you can not highlight any one song. That is why there are no singles. It is somthing you have to listen to as a whole. Thom shows us in this album that there are no boundres to music music can be anything thats why he breaks past the rock genre. The album shows alot of Thoms vocal range and the pure talent of the band. The total mesage of the album in at least my mind is very positive. So what I have to say to all the non likers is that if you cant grow with the band listen to pop music!
2,ugggh oh no,"""we hope that you choke""guess what radiohead, you've chokedjust couldnt follow up good ol' OK computerno one liked OKComputer because the neat studio sound effectsit was the songwriting my friendsnow we have an album completely void of any songwritingoh what a sad dayto see my favorite band not able to write a tuneneat studio tricks cant fix a bad song thom..."
4,#1200th Review?,"I bought this after it was recommended buy this girl at the record store. She implied that Radiohead are ""better"" than the Beatles ever were. It may be hard to make senses of such a comparison but one thing is true- this is one of the only popular bands that is still generating innovative music and that alone is reason enough to buy the damn record."
2,Okay for her first mystery,Interesting first effort by Ms. Sayers but lacked the punch of later efforts. Sayers fans will enjoy it and the background of Peter Whimsey it offers.
2,Has not aged well,"I wanted to read this because it is the first of the Lord Wimsey novels and I thought it would serve as an introduction to the characters. It does not.Because of anti- Semitic remarks throughout the book and the repeated use of the word ""ain't"" by a Lord I do not recommend it.The plot was good but not the writing."
5,Starting Point,"This is the first ""Lord Peter Wimsey"" detective novel, and the logical starting point for the series. If you haven't run into them, this is from the golden age of detective fiction, and Dorothy Sayers wrote classic ""fair play"" mysteries with all the clues laid scrupulously before the reader. Where she deviates from the norm is that her characters tend more often to feel like real people.Whose Body? involves a nude body in a bath and a missing person who resembles but is not our surplus body. It's murder--or at least detection--as good clean fun, solved by a talented amateur and a police inspector--practically a ""type specimen"" of the Golden Age mystery.Warning for the Harriet Vane lovers among us: she's not here yet.If you really can't have Lord Peter withour her, fast forward to STRONG POISON."
5,A great whodunit!,"I love murder mysteries, especially these ""old-timey,"" Sherlock Holmes-esque mysteries with a bit of humor, some twists and turns and all that period jargon. This book was great, not super hard to figure out who the murderer was (in my opinion), but still a fun ride and enough great characters and all those small details to keep me interested. Definitely recommend to any fans of this genre or of these period mysteries!"
4,Fun classic mystery,"This book is for those of us who enjoy an English mystery somewhat like Agatha Christie novels. The character, Lord Peter Wimsey, is unique in that crime solving is his hobby not his profession. Peter has a trusted valet with talents beyond his service training that assist in deciphering clues and providing emotional support. It is a fun read."
4,A little rough start to a great series,"Whose Body? is the first in the Lord Peter Wimsey mystery series. A dead body turns up in Mr. Thipps's bathtub one morning wearing nothing but a pince-nez; at the same time, a prominent financier goes missing. It's obvious that the two cases are connected, but how? In comes Lord Peter Wimsey, an amateur detective who quickly solves the case. He's an interesting detective obsessed with old books and Sherlock Holmes. He is assisted by the eminently capable Mr. Bunter, as well as Mr. Parker of the Scotland Yard.This book felt like a rough draft to me. Only 215 pages long, its as though Sayers just began writing without making an outline, or without knowing much about her protagonist before she began. The murderer is kind of obvious, only because there's no one else who could conceivably have done it. But the premise is intriguing, and the way in which Wimsey solves the case is unique."
1,Good book - terrible edition,"If you are unfortunate enough to be taken in by the least-expensive option & purchase this edition(No publisher listed, but the last page details that its publication date is 21 February 2012 & it hails from Lexington, KY), then you will be severely disappointed. This edition is FULL of typos and type-setting incompatibilities - for any foreign word requiring an accent mark, the letter over which that mark would usually reside is replaced with something similar,but not quite right- c.f., p. 56 ""aegis"" appears as ""3/4gis"". Seriously.This is highly distracting & bespeaks very shoddy workmanship. I am hugely disappointed by this edition. The book itself is entertaining (my first foray into DLS) and the plot has been well-described in other reviews. However,buyer,please find another edition - and Amazon, you should be ashamed to offer such poorly-executed editions!"
3,Obnoxious Wimsey at His Best!,"This is highly entertaining and is a good mystery. Wimsey can be a bit obnoxious at times, but that is part of his charm."
1,Terrible.,"I am not sure how this apalling piece of writing was published, or how anyone has reviewed it successfully. Childish over-written prose. Bulwer-Lytton award winner."
2,"BORING, BORING, BORING",The pace is slow and the plot dull. I started to give this book a one-star rating but I did find Lord Peter to be humorous and likeable. A great read for insomniacs though!
3,"Not her best, by a long shot","This was an early effort by Dorothy Sayers, in which she introduces Lord Peter Wimsey. In her later books, Lord Peter becomes a fully realized character, but in this one he's a bit two-dimensional. Still, it's a pretty good mystery, and anyone who admires Lord Peter should read this one. If it's your first Lord Peter book, just remember that they get much better."
5,An excellent read,An intriguing mystery and characters you enjoy getting to know. An excellent read for any lover of detective novels. I look forward to reading more by this author.
3,I found the style of writing to be way too wordy. What?,"I enjoyed the story and most of the characters but found the dialog of Lord Peter Wimsey to be way over the top babble. However, I didn't enjoy this story enough to rush out and buy more of her stuff. As far as the Kindle version goes I found nothing objectionable (typos, bad formatting, etc) about this edition."
5,Lord Whimsey - dorothy sayers,"he's always fun to read, the plots are always good, and she's a terrific writer. ( (word, word,word, word, word)"
4,Intriguing.,I am fascinated with British mysteries and the details related to the lifestyle of the period documented by Sauer. The technical details are always meticulous.
3,I'm glad there are more Lord Peter books,"I began this series because one of my favorite authors, Elizabeth George, cites D.L. Sayers as a major influence on her work. I always start series books with the first one, so ""Whose Body?"" was the obvious choice. I'm glad there are more of this series because this one is not worthy of the praise that has been bestowed upon the author. ""Whose Body?"" was too predictable; I knew right away who did it. And it was quite tedious. But Lord Peter is eccentric to a fault, and I'm sure that is his charm. If you are a series reader, I think you will find the value of this book is the background information about Lord Peter himself, his way of approaching life and crime, and his relationships with other recurring characters. So my advice is read it anyway. You will learn something and get a good start on what is known as a remarkable body of work (no pun intended...)I must add that I am currently reading ""Clouds of Witness"" which I am thoroughly enjoying."
2,Not her best Wimsey novel,"Maybe I have outgrown the silliness, but this was not the Dorothy Sayer book I remember from my younger days. I might try one more and see if it was a fluke."
2,Poor quality,"The type in this book is very poor quality. The type size is very small, there appears to be at least one extra line space between each paragraph, there are no indents, and some of the special characters are wrong. Whoever produced this book did the absolute cheapest job necessary to meet legal standards. I am a former typesetter, and I can see that the formatting was just not done properly. I may return it because I'm just not sure I can read the extremely small type without getting a headache."
3,Whose Body?,it's a cute story. Some scenes are very hard to follow. The misspellings when characters were speaking French were distracting.
3,disapointed wimsey,I think Dorothy Sayers got better as she went along. Her first try at Peter Wimsey was a disappointment to me.
1,wrong name,"Lord Peter Wimsey is not spelt with an h.Also, the body shown is quite clearly female, andthe body in the book is male.Why such a dreadful and inaccurate cover?"
2,Can Maine be this plain?,"I am planing a trip to Maine and thought I would read-up on the state. Tim Sample is billed as a sort of Down East Dave Barry. The book is vaguely cute but certainly not humorous. Unless this is what passes for humor in Maine (I hope not). The book presents curiosities that are only mildly curious and quirky characters that are not very quirky and wouldn't get a second glance in California or Florida. Its main subject matter seems to be large road-side advertising constructions. As someone who has driven through more than half the states in the Union, I find that the highlighted Maine road-side advertising constructions in this book are nothing out of the ordinary, and hardly rate the write-ups devoted to them here. Disappointing."
1,Waiting...waiting...eject,"I've watched slow-starters before, but this movie dragged for the full 10 minutes that I gave it to draw me in. The scenery & the players were dismal and the script was juvenile: First, you invite your dysfunctional adult sister to join you & your wife on a quiet getaway out of town? Then, you cave in on her pushy curbside plea to also allow her new male friend, whom you've never met, to come join you around the campfire? I mean, really?I confess to jones-ing for some good bloody gore once in awhile, but this one found my husband, having murmured ""ugh"" minutes before I did, watching me from afar to see how long it would take me to wave a white flag and choose a new film to pop in.In summary, I ""let him in"" but then I sent him packing (I re-sold him to Amazon). This one's a waste of time compared to the many frightful heavy-hitters that I've acquired through Amazon."
1,The cover is the only interesting part,"This movie seemed like a compilation of every slasher movie cliche ever made. You have your requisite rich guy jerk who treats everyone like they're beneath him, your requisite whore, your requisite strong, plucky heroine who finally faces the killer alone, and the killer was one of the worst slasher villains I've ever seen. He went from being a seemingly sane, normal person to a drooling, gigglinggeek in a single scene.Like my title says, the cover made me pick it up, but the movie was a total waste."
5,Magnetic Therapeutic Forearm Band,"Extremely effective! Exhausted other forms of therapy and medications? Magnetic therapy works wonders, try it!"
1,"Great record, BAD pressing!","Great record, but not this pressing.My lp came w/ an imprint of the CD included in the jacket. Also, the pressing is off-center such that my tonearm is move left-right so much that I can hear it! If you want to hear Horace's piano sound like a dopler effect than yes, buy this record. I wrote Blue Note about the issue and they said I was SOL. Thanks for standing behind your product, Blue Note. Ha ha. What a joke.For you vinyl junkies, go find an old Liberty or UA reissue. It will be FAR better than what you get here."
5,"I really have nothing to add, but...","There is really nothing more that I can say about this album that has not already been said, except...this may very well be the best jazz album ever recorded. And I've listened to a lot of them.Absolutely impeccable."
5,Fantastic Jazz Piano,"The opening piano part of ""Song For My Father"" is instantly recognizable as a Steely Dan song, but Horace Silver of course came first. The album achieves the jazz Holy Grail of excellent songs and excellent playing. The playing is wonderful throughout, especially in Horace's piano on ""Lonely Woman"". Even though Horace isn't one of the bigger jazz names of his era, this album is certainly one of the bigger jazz albums of the era."
2,"Great music, terrible remastering","This is definitely a jazz classic, and with the advertised ""24-bit remastering"", not to mention that it is part of Blue Note's Rudy van Gelder series, I was ready for a sonic treat. However, it was obviously mastered too loud. Looking at the waveform with Cooledit, there's obivously a fair amount of peak clipping on the CD. What a shame to do this to such classic music."
5,Handel's Messiah,"We own a vinyl edition of this work and when we found that it was available on CD we were very happy until we read that the producer had discontinued this product. We were fortunate to find a used copy. The soloists are very good - I'm not going to debate ""taste and color here,"" you may prefer other artists - and the relatively numerically small choir gives this rendering a more distinct sound. The other great advantage over many versions is that it is complete. You get the entire work. If you don't like a particular part you can skip over it - technology has its advantages."
4,nice,Works as intended. Have them on for over a year now with coil-overs and still holding strong. Gives a nice ride also.
2,The photo is inaccurate.,"If you order this item, you DO NOT receive a faucet which can be mounted as shown in the photo. It does not include the necessary hardware for installation without a large base plate. If you have a one or two-hole drilled sink, this unit will NOT work.This faucet is also quite light-weight compared to similar units, and the sprayer feels like it might be made of tin foil. Still, for the price point, it is an attractive unit, the stainless finish is nice, and the warranty from Price Pfister is decent.I can't comment on the function of the faucet, since I wasn't able to install it due to the issues stated here. It might bear more stars if I had been able to try it."
1,piece of junk,"i have had this faucet for 3 years. granted, it gets heavy use, but the sprayer would get stuck ""on"" shortly after it was installed. about a year into service the sprayer button has completely fell off. the faucet ""sings"" when the water comes on (probably a faulty washer or something) and generally i am extremely disatisfied with this. an experienced plumber has since told me that price pfister is nothing but garbage. i am shopping for a new faucet and will definitely steer clear of anything price pfister puts out. total junk."
5,krhk,The picture quality is excellent and we enjoy seeing these old programs and seeing performances by great musicians who are no longer with us.
5,Bing sings again! As good as I remember,I so enjoyed this group of vintage TV specials. Can hardly wait for the next installment!
5,His best album,"Fabulous accoustic work and haunting lyrics set this one above all MT's work. If you're just bumping around and wondering which MT to buy, this is it. It will touch and awaken parts of you that may now be dormant."
5,"5 Stars, And I Don't Give Five Stars Often","This Vinyl record has been in my collection unplayed since 1985. I was transferring vinyl to my computer this weekend, and played this record. Wow.I don't know if I just in a receptive mood or what--but Mr. Tomlinson spoke to me and I just had to get settled and relaxed and I listened to the whole disk.His melodies are pleasant and his words profound and meaningful, but not so that they get in the way.I'm not really a touchy feely kinda guy, but Mr. Tomlinson touched me this afternoon. Thanks Michael."
2,Fail,"I was so excited about the idea of this product. All four of my dogs love nylabones and I thought this would be a lot more exciting than the standard chews. Within two minutes of giving the BarbeChew to my Boston terrier (medium chewer), she had already made a significant break in the white ""bone"" portion of the toy. At which point, I took the toy away before she could swallow any pieces.On the back of the packaging it says that it is for medium chewers, I would not even recommend it for that."
2,NOT for aggressive chewers,"These ribs seem to taste great to my doggies, but my 35 lb. Ridgeback mix chewed right through the white rib ends within 10 minutes of me giving it to her. She really loves them...They almost smell like ribs or bacon, and apparently she thinks they are the real thing, but i'm going to have to carefully supervise her with this to make sure she doesn't break off big pieces. I give it another 2 days before it is totally devoured into a million tiny pieces on the floor! The price was cheap enough, so I guess it's OK as long as my pups are happy :)Update: 11/28/11It has been about 3 weeks, and I had to throw the ""ribs"" away because my pup was chewing off dime sized chunks and I was afraid she'd choke. I only gave the ribs to her while I was there to supervise, and she only had them a total of about 1 hour in this 3 week period of time. Wouldn't recommend this product for dogs who are determined chewers."
1,Disappointing,"We thought this would be a nice variation of the BarBChew t-bone toy, but this one is rubbery in texture, doesn't have a flavor for the dog to notice. He looked at it, dropped it and never bothers with it. Total waste of $$."
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book, which seemed to be superficial, poorly written, poorly printed, and poorly illustrated. i found it especially annoying that many of the pictures seem to be low quality internet images. i still enjoyed reading it because it was about Shiva. but since i am reviewing this book, i would say do not buy it. you could find everything in this book on the internet, and the book itself is a waste of paper and money."
4,World and Pop Music Embrace,"Although Who I Am was not Gary Wright's biggest seller and now it's even out of print, it is nevertheless a wonderful record.The tracks on this fine piece of work can easily be compared to Peter Gabriel's SO. Yet Gary has always had a unique style of his own, so if you are a fan of world music or Gary, this one is worth hunting down."
5,outstanding,My 1940 published book was in excellent condition and arrived prior to the date that it was expected. I cannot recommend this seller too highly.
2,Disappointing for a Haynes Manual,I have found incorrect descriptions of procedures that have made the job more difficult. The instruction for removing a clip-on windshield wiper was the opposite of what should be done. There are references to a picture showing removal of the panel trim in front of the radio. The picture does not exist. These errors came up with the first 2 jobs that I referred to the manual about. That is a poor batting average!
2,"Very disapointing for newer models, strictly older, unhelpfull,vague","I bought this for my 96 Pontiac Bonneville SSEi Supercharged. FIRST OFF it does not have any information on the 3800 s2 supercharged, diesel or rear wheel drive models. SECONDLY it was very vague and only covered much older models. The information that it did have on newer models could be pieced together from the glove box manual, like changing a headlight, or an abs error light->Response:See break specialist. If I would have known this i would have purchased the Chilton manual."
3,Good for the Price,Its an ok manual but i still feel the chiltons hold a little more information. i basically bought this one for the few obd codes and other tech info. Price is great and haynes does make a good book.
1,Maybe Buns of Rubber...,"This DVD was really a disappointment. I have been missing my old Buns of Steel VHS tape workout, and thought that this would have been a good substitute. However, I didn't find it with this workout. Routines are overly simple, and didn't give me anywhere near the burn feeling that I used to get with the old workout tape. I think this workout was really designed for people who do little to no exercise and are couch-bound!"
2,Buns of Plastic,"This is NOTHING compared to the original Buns of Steel. The warm up in the original video is more of a workout than the workouts on this video. Further, the lady on the video does little to prepare the viewer for the next step so you don't end up following the steps well. I've engage in a lot of aerobic exercise, everything from cardio kickboxing to yoga in both live classes and with videos and this is one of the few times that I kept fumbbling along because of lack of proper instruction and preparation. Even after completing 3 of the routines (one 10 minute routine is totally pointless), my heart rate was not up, my buns did not ache, and I felt like I'd have got more exercise vacuuming. If you're looking for a worthwhile workout video find the original Buns of Steel at your local Half Price Books or order the VHS here online. Now after that one you'll feel the burn AND lose inches!! :)"
4,good target area video,"This video allows you to choose the length of your workout. It is split in to various sections, so you can choose how much you want to do. The instructor is pleasant and explains the exercises well."
2,Cool down before you even get started,"I don't really like this DVD because the workouts aren't very good. They do one thing and stretch, then another move and stretch. I'm not in great shape, but I have never been sore after doing this DVD. I also can't stand to do more than one 10 min workout because I fill like all I do is stretch and cool down."
2,Not much buns more so leg,"I've had the old 80's buns of steel video and i thought buying a newer version would be great, but this video has bairly any bun workouts. Most of the focus was on legs aka your quads i believe. Would not suggest for people who want a serious bun workout like i did"
3,Recommend for beginners,I was expecting this video to be more challenging than it is. I would recommend this for beginner exercisers as opposed to more advanced exercisers. Low impact and slow paced for the most part. I always enjoy Leisa Hart as an instructor though.
1,Not like the classic video,"I thought I would be sucking air and have Jello legs, but man was I wrong! This work out is lame and I barely broke a sweat. I hate the slow pace. This DVD is going in the cupboard and not coming out."
2,As others say..,"It is for sure for beginners not advanced..so if you are looking for advanced then dont get this! But if you are a beginner, this will be good for you."
2,Not much of a workout.,"I have not had a gym membership for over a decade. Because I have small children I excercise in my home only. I have used countless workout videos and I really work hard at getting the most out of them. After using this video I wasn't even sore. It was too easy. I didn't feel like I got a good workout from it. However, this video may work for someone who has never worked out. I'm not in EXTREMELY great shape but I am in good shape and I am in my 30s."
5,"Super , easy and effective","Buns of Steel: Sculpting and ToningI find this workout very good, you can sellect the type of exercise you want to do.in my opinion all are very good, easy and no special equipment needed.I am just waiting to get the new DVD arms of steel.Congrats for this Item.Claudia V"
3,Tonto goes to town,"Whenever the Lone Ranger sent Tonto to town, Tonto got beat up. I can just picture the conversations they must have had.LR: Listen Tonto, I want you to go into town and deliver this important message to the sheriff.Tonto: Please, Kemo Sabe, the last 12 times you sent me to town I got beat up.LR: Don't worry, Tonto, that is all in the past. I'm sure everything will be fine this time.In this book, in every chapter almost without exception, Susan gets spanked. Poor creature. The plot is a little monotonous and predictable. But she's a cute kid."
2,Ultimate Trash,"I hate this CD. It only has two great songs, the rest TRASH that you hear on the radio every five minutes. Why buy this stuff when you can hear them for free on the radio? The cool songs, are NOT worth $ so think about it."
1,"Move on, there's so much better to spend your money on...","Let's face it, Ultimate Dance Party was never really that great... but at least before, its' content was decent. I've got to say that this CD lacks in any originality. Most of the songs on this album are remixes of random radio hits... and while some remixes are good... the ones on this CD aren't. If you're into pop and r&b hits that are cheesily remixed, then this is your CD. If you're into true club music with energy and originality, it's in your best interest to shy away from the Ultimate Dance Party series, and 2000 is no exception."
3,Music Changes with the Times...,"And I'm afraid that's the case here. This was a great CD when it first came out, but by now Time has passed these tracks by... really only worth the investment if you are chronicling or collecting past hits. Otherwise, stick with something more contemporary."
4,One of the Greatest of Film Noirs,"To all the previous reviews, I should like to add high praise for the performance of James Stephenson. This underappreciated actor died the year after this film was released, in 1941. While the story is nominally about the Bette Davis character, Stephenson's riveting portrayal of a lawyer, torn between his sense of duty to his profession and his personal loyalties, almost steals the show.The only problem with this film is Max Steiner's overwrought and intrusive score. It might work with Bogart, but it's too much for the dreamlike atmosphere I think director Wyler is trying to evoke.One of the few films I can watch repeatedly, The Letter is one of the videos I like to entertain guests with in my home theatre."
3,DVD was a disappointment,"Yes, the 1940 Bette Davis version is great. But, the advance advertising of coupling the 1940 version with the 1929 Jeanne Eagles version is what led me to pre-order this DVD. It's hard for me to believe that Warner Home Video and web sites describing this DVD did not know of the ""alleged"" legal issues with the 1929 version prior to the January 11th release date. These DVDs, cover art, and cover content are not manufactured, distributed, and shipped overnight. I suspect the omission of the 1929 version was known at least a month or two ago. I also suspect that interest in the 1929 version prompted re-thinking of including it for free in the release of the Bette Davis version compared to marketing it alone as a future separate DVD (and additional income). This is the last time I pre-order a DVD."
3,For Fans Of Classic Movies,"How one views this movie depends, I would think, on how one generally views classic-era films. For those who enjoy them, this is one to see since it stars one of the great actresses of all time, Bette Davis. For those who prefer faster-paced, modern movies, this would not be recommended.Myself, I enjoyed Henry Stephenson and his character, ""Howard Joyce"" in here the most. He got better and better as the film went on, and for me, was the star of the film. Sadly, Stephenson died about a year after this movie came out.Most people will enjoy yet another sterling performance from Davis, who plays a shady character, ""Leslie Crosbie, "" a woman trying to get away with murder. Davis is good at playing despicable, scheming liars and she does that well here in this film.William Wyler's direction and Tony Gaudio's photography give us good atmosphere, which I why I wanted to see this on DVD after seeing a so-so VHS tape."
3,Classical detective story,"""The Letter"" is easy to read, interesting, but not very creative. You can see such a story in every detectiv movie! But I think it was really colourful and amusing and all the less the end is surprising, but also quite trashy. This book was another exemple of how unpredictable people are."
3,if you like action and on-location work this ain't it.,"Yes, the first five minutes are great. After that it's turgid, over-acted, claustrophic, and over-scored. Davis is repulsive. I guess that's her specialty. I'm sure she and Wyler fought about her portrayal, as they did during ""Little Foxes"". Her performance would be okay if she were on stage, but is too arch and mannered for the screen. If you like your women mannish and faux-British (with ""mid-Atlantic"" accents) you should love this.For Davis and Wyler fans a must-see, of course.The transfer itself is mostly first-rate."
5,Bette Davis movie,"This film has many lessons. A woman obsessed with a man is capable of any injustice or crime. We see such incidents today with mothers murdering their babies for men they have an obsession with. Bette Davis murdered the man with whom she had an obsession because he came to his senses and wanted to recommit his life to his wife. It is an intense film and demonstrates the power of reality, and facing the reality of obsession. Davis' character is at last murdered by the grieving widow.The product was packaged well, arrived on time, and in good condition.I am always happy with Amazon fulfillment."
3,Wordy but Interesting,"I think this story could have been told better in half the space. The author kept going on and on! Do we really need to hear so many little details about everything? The dialogue was awkwardly wordy in a number of places. However, the overall story is a good one, and anyone interested in Ancient Egypt is sure to enjoy the cultural and historical insights. Basically a good read, but I wouldn't call it a page-turner, and don't expect to get through it quickly."
1,Do not buy for Kindle,"The BrandenburgStudies ebook edition is obviously not edited for Kindle. The line breaks after a few letters, often in the middle of words. Too expensive for such poor quality, no wonder there was no sample."
2,I don't recommend it...,"I was assigned this book for school and it was probably one of the most boring books I've ever read. The opening is too boring to grab at your attention, and by the time it gets exciting, it's too late and your interest is gone.What's strange about this book is, at different points, the book was very interesting and informative. The only problem is that it had periods of being very interesting, and then really, really boring. The bad sort of outweighs the good.I recommend to you... do something useful with your time instead of wasting it on this book."
5,make it a MUST,This is one of Henty's more readable books. All my boys enjoyed it. There is enough action to keep them focused and much less battle descripton than is usually in his books. There is also a volume of information about life in this ancient time which is such a fun way of learning history. I think it should be on the 'must read' list of any child's study of ancient Egypt.
4,"Good, but slow.","The book started out really slow. It has portions of really good parts and slow parts. The book really starts developing about midway through. The author has added some really smart Bible references. For those that do not often read classics like Charles Dickens, the way the book is written can be difficult to get used to.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes Egyptian History, Biblical history, or classic books."
3,Dated,"This book is quite enjoyable, but it does drag on a little at first. It has obviously been writen for children as a (partly) instructional book, and the writer goes into much detail describing how things were done in Ancient Egypt. Since this book was written, many more things have been found out concerning Ancient Egypt, and therefore some of the infromation is off the mark.The languague in this book is beautiful, but old-fashioned. I liked it a lot, even if many of today's readers may think it to be bombastic. The storyline is good.Even so, the book is dated, both in its attitude and morals. For instance, we have an extensive description of a hippopotamus hunt, which was seen as good sport, whereas a party which involded the contributions of accomplished muscicians and dancers is pictured as lewd and altogether a waste of time.So this is quite a good book, but there is better around, both in historical accuracy and in honesty to the old culture."
4,Long winded but good,"My 12 year old brother read this book (he loves to read Henty's works) and this is basically what he thought of it- ""Unlike other Henty books, this one had very long winded speeches that made it harder to keep my interest. But overall it was a good book."" Not one of his favorites, but still a good read."
3,L'Oreal Light Reddish Blond,"L'Oreal definitely provides a unique color with the Light Reddish Blonde/Warmer dye. I haven't seen any boxed hair dye that will attempt to give you a strawberry blonde hue. I've used this dye twice and I do like the results, although the second time it turned out a bit more coppery than I wanted. Just be warned that warm home hair dye can have an orange effect.My only other negative is the smell. STRONG. It's almost worth setting up a mirror outside just for the ventilation."
2,Warning: This is NOT a Light Brown!,"I purchased this hair color in ""Light Beige Brown 6BB"" and it is anything but a light brown. My hair is a dark burgandy red!! It looks terrible and I can't wait for it to fade. If you are going to use this hair color I suggest picking out the color you like and then going down 2 shades lighter."
5,L-Oreal Excellence #9A Light Ash Blonde,I have a hard time finding this product in any of the stores and having been using it for years. It is the perfect color for me and wears well. I was so glad to receive it in the mail in good condition and at a good price. Thank you so much.
5,My Wife Loves this Product,"My wife first purchased this color at CVS. Since then, she had me order a whole bunch of them from Amazon for a better price. She likes the way it works and look. Will buy more when she runs out. Recommended."
2,Turned my hair silver grey,"I liked the idea of the beige blonde look, but it made my hair more like a dark beige and it turned it a silver grey color, which was pretty but not what I wanted. Luckily, it washed out with a lemon juice and conditioner mix that I used. I also liked the idea that it softened mature features, but with the silver grey in my hair, I felt like it made me look older."
4,Best Product I've Found,"I've been using this product for over 17 years and am very happy with it. My hair is very long (below my rear end) & naturally brown with red tints. It only takes one box, and I apply it to the roots first and then streak some through the rest of my hair. I only apply it every 12-16 weeks, and it leaves my hair very healthy looking. I have 2 children with red hair and this color matches theirs almost exactly. Everyone thinks it is my natural color. I love the conditioner included with the product. The color leaves an unpleasant odor to the hair after the application, but the conditioner smells great and helps to mask the odor. The odor usually disappears by the second time I wash my hair. My only complaint is that it doesn't cover the white hairs that have began to come in ever increasingly. Also, they used to put coupons in the boxes or put it on sale, but I rarely find it on sale anymore - the price just keeps going up. Still cheaper than a salon though."
1,Turned My Roots Copper Penny Red!!,"I have been using Excellence Dark Chocolate Brown 4AR, for a few years and the color has always been perfect.I had purchased 3 boxes of hair color from this vendor. I applied the first box of color, and my gray roots turned bright copper. Thinking it was a fluke, I applied the second box of color 2 weeks later and AGAIN, bright copper roots.I called L'Oreal and was informed that the hair color I was sold, is outdated and had expired quite some time ago.A word to the wise..take caution in buying hair color from this vendor, it is beyond annoying, and a waste of money!!"
1,L'Oreal Excellence Triple Protection Color Creme Med Blond Nat 8 (pack of 3),"Super stoked on the price but when it came, it looked as if it was made in the 90's. There is not even an expiration date on the stuff. The coloring is even off a bit and I'm going to contact Loreal to find out when it was made and what kind of expired effect the chemicals are having on my head. Dont like the fact that I'm having to do this (color my hair), and now it's even worst knowing that the molecules in this stuff is breaking down and forming someother compound. I think I'm going to throw it out!! It's burns my scalp! I had to go to target and buy ""new"" coloring that obviously is not made a decade ago. Not happy about this one."
4,red,"The product is great leaves your hair soft and full, I was surprised though, it is really quite red, and very dark, much darker than I expected but it is rich and I am hoping that I can get use to it. I was completely light gray , and it covered it 100% . So the product is good but be careful if you have a red in your hair cause it will be quite red.Thanks L'oreal pat from Ny"
1,Read the fine print!,"I like this haircolor a lot and have been using it for years. It gets good gray coverage and is a nice medium brown. The problem is in the fine print. This color comes in both ""warmer"" and ""cooler,"" according to the fine print on the right of the box, next to the color number. My friend who is a hairdresser says ""warmer"" gives better gray coverage, which is definitely what I need, and I like warmer tones better in general. The picture on the Amazon website clearly says ""warmer"" on this box, yet when I order, they send me a box of ""cooler."" Not cool! I so far have been able to exchange it at drugstores that carry the warmer version, but it is hard to find in stores also. Amazon, PLEASE, stock and send me the warmer version, because according to the picture, this is what I am ordering! If you do, this review will go from one star to five!"
1,i am so pissed right now!,"I am just so pissed right now because the description is completely wrong. instead of a dark brown color, my hair is now jet BLACK!!!I just spent $100 on bleaching my hair and thanks to this product, i have to spend another 100 to bleach my hair again.."
1,Turned my medium brown hair black,"I love L'Oreal products and have used many of their hair dyes. I have very fine, naturally medium to dark brown hair with very little grey at the temples. I can go for very long time periods without dying my hair.I decided to try this shade as in the past, I've had good luck with all medium browns except for one of the shades of Feria which turned it black. I had to use Color Ooops to get the black out of my hair that time.I was shocked to see that this color turned my hair black on the ends and way too dark brown on the top. I tried using Prell and dish liquid to lighten it which helped a little, but I just hated the color.I got some Color Zapp and used just 1/2 the powder to lift this color out of my hair. I think the mistake was that the color does not have gold tones ... so no more of these shades for me!"
4,Better than most!,The only better product I have used is the regular Ultress. It makes my hair soft and glossy. This stuff runs a close second though my hair doesn't feel as soft. At least there is no breakage like some others I have used.
5,Great Hair Color,"I ordered this for my mom, and i'm her at-home hair colorist (must be nice!). she loves this color and either its popular, or just the opposite, because there are normally only 1 or 2 or none left on the shelves at the stores!Great, rich color and a good product!"
1,Sucks,nto too much to say about this...Footage was wack looks very low budget and was very weak in it contents I do not recommend ....
3,"Happy, but things could have been better","Well, I haven't received my CD. Firstly the original order failed to arrive at the second was place automatically so I am hoping for the best."
2,"This book sets out the basics, like ""do what you need to do""","This book is helpful, if you have no idea about what it means to write a dissertation. It does provide an overview of all of the basics, like what it means to select a committee, and how many pages make an average dissertation. However, it is full of advice that boils down to, ""do what you need to do"" and ""do it with integrity"".While it is a very compact book, and has lots of useful information, it's a bit like reading a style manual. Several books for social scientists are available (see Howard Becker), and some of the books that deal more with the psychology of writing (and staying motivated to write) the dissertation might be a better buy."
4,Good starter!,"This gave me the framework to begin, but it in no way describes the process to get to the end! Good as a starting block."
5,"Very practical, organized guide for dissertation-writing","This is a very helpful little book. It is basic, and easy to read. It brings a sense of order and structure to the large concept of ""go write your dissertation."" This book will not do the dissertation research or writing for you, and it can't force you to complete each step of the project. But, it gives very practical, concise tips for each phase of the process. And excellent quick resource for those who are just starting the dissertation process. I think this book would appeal to linear thinkers--or people who need to be linear thinkers for the purpose of getting their dissertations done--as it is a very structured and organized book."
4,happy about this,"i'm happy about this product, i just received it and everything's their, it came with a cool little lid that keeps the whole thing togeather so you dont really loose the pieces."
5,great!,Very sharp edges making it easy to cut through cookie dough. Definitely would recommend to anyone!
1,Rust,These cookie cutters do no hold up over time. Many of the cutters have rust on the edges. Do not recommend.
2,They rust if you put them in a plastic bag,"I just noticed that the cutters are full of rust even though I made sure they were dry before I stored them. I think they rusted because I put them in a ziplock bag which must have sweat and created humidity. I am very disappointed. I have used them once or twice only. Also, they bend a lot. You constantly need to adjust them so that they become perfectly round."
4,does what it needs to,"I agree with another reviewer that once the cookies bake, you can't really tell they are crinkle-edges. But it works and there is a variety of sizes, so it isn't a horrible buy. I love that they all fit nicely in a tin."
5,crinkle cutters,"I bake a lot and having a nice, sharp cookie cutter is a must. I lobe these cutters, becasue they come in 4 perfect sizes and they are very sharp and tall. I love them, and highy recommnet them. Thank youP.S. same applies to the round cutters!!"
4,Perfect for the casual baker,"Other reviewers have complained of the lack of measurements on these cutters. While I see where that could be a problem for a professional baker, they fit my needs perfectly. I just grab the size I think looks right.The biggest benefit is the storage. This tuck away perfectly in the back of a drawer so they aren't in the way. They are a bit delicate and would bend under pressure, but no more so than many other kitchen utensils that must be handled with care. I've used these to cut homemade pasta for tortellini, biscuits, drop cookies, and as a ring mold for plating potatoes, risottos and cous cous."
5,Ateco cutter set purchased through Amazon,"The product was exactly as described and the price was competitive. Shipper packaged it appropriately, and it arrived to my home quickly. Will choose to do business with this merchant again."
4,Savvy Shopper,"Very well made - despite the ubiquitous ""Made in China"" - these 11 crinkle cutters (from 3/4"" to 3-1/4"") all have nicely rounded tops which are very easy on the palms as you use them repeatedly.BUT - the best feature is the little can, in which they are all stored neatly, concentrically.Why not 5 stars? - I would have preferred larger crinkles (especially for the larger sizes)."
5,Another Great Product,"I bought these along with a set of square cutters. And I use these cutters for just about everything, Cutting crepes, Ham, and of course cookies. The uses are unlimited. There very well made. I hand wash mine and dry by hand and then put them away till the next time. I would expect these to last a very long time."
2,Too Small,"I am disapointed after receiving this item. It is cute but way to small.After cutting the cookie dough, very hard to get the stuff out, and the shape changed.I won't recommend this to other people."
3,Decent set of cutters,"I bought these a while back to add to my ever-growing tool kit for work and culinary school. Over all, I'm pleased with the cutter set, but I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed in the material. As I found out the hard way, this steel WILL rust, and it will rust QUICKLY. I'd recommend this set to others (because of its price and the difficulty of finding a decent set of cutters), but be very careful to hand-dry and then let them sit to dry out a while longer before putting them back in the can."
3,Not a high quality product,"The set itself and the choice in variety of sizes is quite good, but the quality of the steel the set is made of could be better. Almost impossible to wash it, get the rust on rings and on the box itself."
3,Hexagon Cutter Set,I received the cutters in a timely fashion. They are pretty typical for cookie cutters. The set did not include one the size I needed so I ended up making one from cardboard. It worked perfectly. I could have saved a lot of money (shipping was excessive) by just making my own.
1,Ateco 7 Piece Stainless Steel Leaf Cutter Set,This product was disappointing. The pieces were too small. You can hardly produce a creative piece out of it. Absolute waste of money and shipping
5,Just what we needed for cookies.,"Not much to add - it is as advertised, and works great. Holder keeps them neat and organized as well."
5,Great for biscuits,"Sturdy, comes in a variety of sizes. Works well for cutting biscuits, donuts, or cutting out the center of bread for eggs-in-a-basket. Will certainly find more uses in days to come."
5,I love it!,Totally satisfied with my purchase. I use these as cookie cutters all the time for special holidays and occasions. It makes life a lot easier. Ateco is a trusted brand for me and very sharp cutters makes clean cut outs.
5,Kitchen cutter set.,"This set is perfect. There is every size you could possible need to make anything from cookies, to biscuits, to whatever your imagination can dream up. Haven't have a problem w/sticking and cleans up great in the dishwasher."
5,Love these!,These make my everyday cookies just a little fancier with the scallopped edges. Great cleaning and I like the quality. Nothing fancy but it works!!
1,can't rate...product way late,Thought I would have cookie cutters before Christmas but don't think so. Might send it back as soon as I get it...missing cutters for Christmas baking is priority.
5,Round cookie cutter set,I have been looking for a sturdy multi sized round cookie cutter set. Well these definitely fit the bill. They are metal which is great & I love all the size options. A good brand!
5,Alecto 3 piece rectangular cutter set,"Live it. I bake all the time sor school, church and family. These cutters give me a great flexibility in all my work."
5,It's a Keeper,"This is a great set of cutters. Clean, level edges and good circular shape. I have dropped one cutter without any damage. The set fits neatly in the can. Lid stays securely on."
1,made in China crap!!,"This brand of products isn't worth the time. I have made several purchases (all at same time) and the product is made in China crap. sharp edges, rusted after first wash. Will not be buying products from this company ever."
4,Sizes,"I could not find the sizes in the description, so here they are for anyone else who may be wondering.The Ateco 4 Piece Stainless Steel Round Cutter Set contains cutters in the following sizes:1 1/2""2 1/2""3 1/2""4 1/2""I haven't used them yet, but they feel sharp yet somewhat flimsy. I would be careful storing them so that they do not get dented, and as others mentioned, the plastic box that they come in will not hold up for long as a storage box. The tops of the cutters are turned under, and are comfortable to press down on while cutting, and the generous height makes them ideal for biscuits or even to use as a food mold. As with most stainless steel products, these cutters are made in China."
3,Be sure to dry completely before storing or they rust,"I love these except that if they are not totally dry when putting away, they rust so beware of that before it happens to you."
4,As expected,"Everything was as expected. A bag to hold the pieces would have been a nice but inexpensive bonus, but other than that suggestion I am content."
5,A Great Work,"I came across this book purely by accident at local yard sale. Being a fan of Shakespeare's ""Richard III,"" I was intrigued by the author's assertion that Richard was not the much-maligned hunchback who killed his nephews. I ended up paying 25 cents for a well-worn book with no cover, and it was the best investment I ever made in a book! The action and story catch you from page one, and the plot moves at a great pace with only a few minor bogged down areas. By the end of the book, I was a convert. I fully believed the author's assertions that Richard's history was maligned by successors who were trying to cement their control in England. I've purchased a new copy since and have passed it on to several friends. BUY BUY BUY!"
5,Incredible historical fiction,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. As a bibliophile with a degree in history, I have to say that this book, along with Penman's Here Be Dragons series, have truly had an influence not only on my personal reading preferences but also on my perception of history. This book made me realize that historians are not always correct, and the victors really do tell the tale. Richard III has been dehumanized throughout the centuries until he is known as being almost impossibly cruel and evil. Penman shows us a very plausible picture of a man struggling against circumstances and his own values in a morally difficult situation--not the murdering monster that he has been branded. Well written, amazing historical details, memorable and human characters, and a rich descriptive narrative make this a truly amazing book."
5,The Sunne In Splendour,"Penman effectively shows that there is a side to Richard III that has been forgotten over time. The novel teaches the reader about the kind man who was deeply devoted to a country, a family, and a woman he always loved. It also gives an explanation to the murder of the ""princes in the tower"" that shows Richard, not as the cold-blooded killer, but rather a man who trusted those who called themselves his friends, and would never have laid a finger on his brother's children. For anyone who finds English history interesting, this is a must read."
5,"the best book I've ever read, un-put-downable!","I was recommended this book by my school library having said I wanted a historical book. As I read more and more of it, I became caught up in the plot, falling in love with Richard and found myself wishing that just for once, he could win. I smiled for chapters after Edward beat the Lancastrians and cried when Richard was finally betrayed at the battle of Bosworth. The book had me enthralled from the first chapter and I saw an entirely new perspective of the history of my own country. This brilliant book brings all the great magnates of medieval England to life and shows the betrayals, loyalties and the huge sacrifices that men have made for power up superbly.(I even ended up wishing that there were guys as valient and chivalrous as this depiction of Richard III around still today! )"
5,Worth every tear,"I loved these characters, and thanks to Sharon Kay Penman, wanted more for these people than life had given them. When fiction, history and life can so perfectly mesh, a true and rare treat is waiting for you to pick it up and read it."
5,Surprisingly Enjoyable,"What an awesome work this is.Since Penman's prose is a bit headier than most these days, it may take a while to warm up to her style. But once you do, this novel really sings. Makes you feel as if you knew Richard."
5,The best work of fiction I've ever read.,"I'm a avid reader and have read thousands of books. I've never read a better written book. I've purchased it 20+ times and have given copies to friends, family, and business associates. Without question the masterpiece of historical fiction. Ms. Pennman is an artist - we are in a richer world for her work."
4,Who knew about Richard?,"Following the reign of Edward IV and Richard the III, Penman does a wonderful job of weaving history and narrative. Penman portrays Edward as a once grand and thoughtful king whose downfall is hurried by his greedy, power hungry, vindictive wife and her family (Elizabeth). Richard, in contrast, is all that is possibly good in a potential King and a foil to Edward.This is a controversial history because Richard (of Shakespeare fame) has historically had a bad reputation. Penman sees little historical proof for this perspective and Richard becomes a man who is ultimately felled by his own goodness. While the history is interesting, what Penman is good at is weaving a compelling story around characters who are complex and interesting"
5,A Perfect Book,Wow what a book...I have tried to write my review several times and each time I find my words can not adequately describe what a great book this is and the extent to which I enjoyed it.So I can only say go find this book and read it - you will definitely not be sorry.
5,A New Look for Richard III,"A most interesting view of Richard III. A counter balance to the Shakespearean depiction, and the model for most Hollywood productions. I was totally surprised by the author's description of his military leadership and tactical abilities. The author does a superb job in detailing medieval combat. Her description of the physical effort of combat and the realism of a battle's outcome on both the winners and losers is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
5,A top notch novelist,A great read for those who enjoy historical fiction. Ms. Penman's writing style will put you right in the midst of historical England. My first time reading Ms. Penman's works...however...not my last! At times one does get lost in which character is which but overall it's worth one's time and effort. At times a bit graphic and not for the feint of heart.
5,great great,Really a gem .This subject is very difficult to write about well without having a vast amount of research and study.The author has both and has a magical pen. She excelled in her prior books 'Here be Dragons'and 'Fall the Shadow' the story of the Welsh wars.And particularly about the heroic yet little known Simon Monfort. Those books made you stay up all night without being able to put them down.This does the same. This topic is much closer to us in time and in reality as political intrigue and betrayal are still with us. Wonderful reading
5,So maybe he wasn't such a bad guy...,"This was the first time I've read anything sympathetic to Richard III, he's usually portrayed as a monstrous villain. It was interesting to see an author so convincingly take a different stance on the type of man he was. I won't rehash the entire book, but just wanted to say that this is another example of why SKP has quickly become one of my favorite authors."
5,Wonderful Historical Read!,Sharon Kay Penman writes a wonderful historical fiction book. Her books are long and complex and the research that goes into the making of each one is tremendous. I have personally learned a lot about English history (especially about the Aquitane era) from reading her many wonderful books.
5,Richard III,"The author brings to life the tumultuous, double dealing times at the close of the Middle Ages. Richard III wasn't the misshapen depraved monster as depicted by Shakespeare. He was a king living in an insecure murderous time where friends and foes were not constrained by moral virtues."
3,Not Her Best,"I think Ms. Penman has found her metier with her later books - the medieval mysteries.She is without question a scrupulous researcher and a fine historian. But...she tends to unnecessary verbosity and ""Sunne"" can be confusing and at times tedious.Sandra Worth's award-winning ""Rose of York"" (which covers the same subject and was recently published) grabbed me from the get-go and I found it to be much more readable, dramatic, and enjoyable than ""Sunne"". Worth's writing skill is sheer brilliance. I never drifted a moment from ""Rose of York"" but I found myself repeatedly lost while reading ""Sunne"".However, with Ms. Penman's medieval mysteries I think she has come into her own. She is masterful in this genre."
3,Soccer mom meets Richard III,"This was my second Penman novel, after There Be Dragons. Penman is accurate on dates and places, and can build up scenes and characters. However, the ideals of the book are so anachronistic, the sensibilities, be they in war, marriage or child rearing, so unmedieval, so post-1970s American, that both the books feel like they were written by a soccer mom who has nothing but the deepest sorrow for the people she is writing about. That work if Penman had a shred of humor, of irony, of anything other than the pathetically earnest ""BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN!"" hand wringing as the general tenor of her writing.I'd suggest CJ Sansom, Dorothy Dunnett (Lymond Chronicles), Patricia Finney (Becket/Ames series), Steven Saylor (Roma Sub Rosa series), if you're into historical fiction. There is a humor, strangeness, over-the-top craziness in the writing of those novelists that are completely absent in Penman."
2,Ms Penman not to everyone's taste,"I recently ordered Sunne in Splendour based on the strength of the many positive reviewer recommendations. Apparently, the appeal of Ms. Penman's writing escapes me - I found the writing dry, the characters flat, and the sense of time and place poorly drawn. It's not that this book is bad, it's just not good. Of course this is only a personal impression, but if you are a fan of, say Patrick O'Brian, and looking for another historical fiction author to read, I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,What happened to the Kindle Version?,"I got the sample on my Kindle. When I went back to buy the book a few days later, it was no longer available. Does anyone know what happened?"
2,Spell check,The book is good ... but could be great ... if I was not so bothered by all the errors and typos. For 10 dollars I expect better from Kindle. Do not buy the Kindle edition unless you enjoy converting typos into words. ...
3,Heavy book!,I bought the hardback version. It's 935 pages long and very heavy. I'd recommend buying the Kindle version.
4,"Good Documentary, but it is very broad","I really like the documentary, it had interview from almost very one involved in the Arab-Israeli wars, peace processes, etc. It really did cover a lot of information, but my only problem is that it covers too much and did not go into detail on many issues, I would have liked to seen more information about the wars that Israel and the Arabs went through with more original footage instead of just mostly interviews. In addition, more maps throughout the documentary to describe the situations of the wars and the settlements. I had some historical problems in the documentary, it makes it sound like there were no Jews in the then Palestine before 1948 which is very wrong, the majority were Arabs but there were a large number of Jews living in Palestine before 1948. All in all the documentary does cover a lot of information and is very unbiased."
3,Well Done but...,This documentary is well done. I believe that most of what's in this amazing documentary movie is true except the part about 73 war and thats why I gave it 3 stars only. (...)This very true and important part is completely omitted from this documenatry!!
2,Middle East Follies,"I found that this video did not provide me with anything new. While the title is ""catchy,"" a more appropriate title could have been any of the following: ""Israel and the US;"" ""Israel's secret ally: Saudi Arabia;"" ""Drang Nach Osten: living space for Jews on the West Bank;"" and so on."
1,"Great movie but I received an ""ILLEGAL COPY""","Great movie, but I'm still dissapointed with the seller.I received my ""copy"" on time, kind of cheap for a $1.00 DVD+ disc"
3,"Decent, but not outstanding","You get what you pay for.Pros: Inexpensive, somewhat comprehensive in detail and scope (especially regards to ""might-have-been ships such as the Owari, G3, and Lexington classes)Cons: Weak editing in a few glaring cases (Bungo Straights, furore, calbier), black and white photos, line drawings only.Inconsistent attention to detail (section on German ships went into detail on turret types, but this is not repeated with other nationalities).Other notes:1)Could be made more succesful if they included articles on various battleship related topics such as Washington Treaty, pre-dreadnought race, influence of politics upon battleship development, etc. The book has only a short intro before they begin talking about the various ships.2) Useful as a reference book in conjunction with other books, but would not rely solely on this book as a reference.Would recommend this as a ""buy"", but be aware of its limitations."
5,Chezidon!!,"Since 1993 I've been hearing this guy and I LOVE IT! He has this unique style in ""reggaeton"" that makes you dance even sleeping....Xiny"
2,Room to Room?,"I didn't do much searching around for a wireless AV system. I saw the price and like the look of the Kinamax SC-WAVT 2.4GHz. When I Opened the box I was impressed by the metal casing, and the solid design. It looked professional. It works great if you sit in one spot, the phone doesn't ring, no wii controllers are on, and if the moon isn't out. Yeah it seems like it cant even send a clear signal 5 ft let alone a whole room. But that one or two days a month that it works, it's great."
3,OK but specs are wrong,"This product performs about as well/poorly as others have stated here. I bought it to relay a camera feed from the back of my RV so distance is not a killer and audio is irrelevant to me. The important error I found in the specs is that the units are not actually 12 volts DC. The units are actually 8 volts DC. This is irrelevant if you are using the supplied power packs in a 120 volt AC (e.g., home) environment. It is a very important error if you plan to put either or both units into a car/truck/RV."
1,Piece of Junk!,Bought this item through Tiger Direct - does not work at all. I have a wireless sub that is about 10 feet away - hooked it up and nothing. Wasted money - the only bad thing that I've ever purchased on Amazon.
1,?????????,"this thing do not working, I try is for 100 time and nothing.Please someone have any idea for very use it.And I don't wanna send this back, because i want spend more money on shiping and for days to get this back.Thanks anyway."
3,not bad,"I saw this picture in DVD and I enjoyed it. It harkened back to the Saturday Matinee days. It was an interesting plot and I thought the acting was pretty good, especieally Christopher Atkins and Dana Barron. Edward Albert was good as the square jawed Sheriff. It is an old fashioned western, the kind they don't make anymore, a bit slow but well worth the effort."
1,Bad Low Budget,"I don't know which was worse in this film, the story, the acting, the special effects, or the poor editing. I am glad I work in a video store and can rent films for free. All I wasted was my time watching it. If I paid even $.50 I would have been horribly overcharged. The special effects was just guys in costumes shot in black light. Ohhhh.... So scary.... Not. And my gosh, you can see Semis driving in the background! Now I'm not much of a history buff but I know they did not have cars in the old west. Sheesh. Don't waste your money on this terrible film."
2,WOW,This movie must have had a very low budjet due to the fact that the special effects are so horrible! I would never watch this movie again if I wasn't in love with Roger Velasco!!!
5,Every kid and most adults ...,... need the empowering message delivered in this book. Simple and straight forward with a zinger of a last line of dialog. You won't forget this book.
5,How to encourage a child to create art with out showing how.,"Suddenly at the age of five or six, because their thought process is becoming more concrete, because children are looking for logic instead of warping reality to fit what they know, the creative process takes a hit. When you give them a paper, put them on the spot and ask them to draw all they can draw is a blank. Then comes the whining, `But, but..... I don't know what to draw. Can you help me?' That's it. The adult then rolls his/her sleeves, either demonstrates or gives ideas and the art transforms to the adult's art. It is no longer the child's. As a parent or as a teacher what do you do? How do you encourage the child to create?Peter H Reynolds tackles this in his The Dot. The teacher in this book, looks at Vashti's blank paper and asks her if it is a polar bear in a snow storm! She then encourages Vashti to make a mark. This leads Vashti to create a gallery full of paintings."
5,Good for kids and art teachers,I use this book towards the beginning of the school year in my classes as well as when I start the unit on Impressionism. It is a fun way to show students that practice and self confidence can lead to big accomplishments.
4,Big kids and The Dot,"I'm a middle school art teacher. I read the book to every class on the first day. Then, I gave them a few different media to use, (watercolor, oil pastels, markers) and asked them to ""make a dot and see where it takes you"" We made two rules, you had to know where your original dot was and you had to work for 15 minutes. The results are great and we are off to a great start. I also own ISH by the same author and use it a little later in the semester."
5,Beginning to create,My grandchild is creative but struggling with her interest in reading. This book is about a subject in which she excels. I am anxious for her to receive it as a Christmas gift. The story is great and really inspiring for children or even adults who don't know where to start with art and creative expression.
5,Beauty is in the eye of the beholder!,"Wonderful simple story about starting to do something, and do your best and remembering not everyone will like it. I love the way this author uses art to get important points across."
5,The perfect gift,"Anyone who works with children and reaches out to give them a sense of self-worth deserves this book as a gift. It is simple, gentle and touching. The Dot is the story of a child who is frustrated with the artwork she makes until a teacher tells her simply, ""sign it"". That small interaction gives the girl the confidence to take chances and grow until, ultimately, she's the one saying ""sign it"". This book speaks to the idea that teachers really do touch eternity...they never know where their influence will stop. If you have a favorite teacher, give him/her this book."
5,"Fantastic ""The Dot""",This book is amazing! Total encouragement to young and old alike that there is nothing you can't do if you look at it the right way. Fabulous!
4,The Dot,"The Dot is a beautifully illustrated book about a VERY good art teacher. I found it when I was already an adult, but in a way it is written for adults anyway. The book addresses those who are unsure of themselves, which occurs in adults just as often as in children. The message is clear but not didactic, and the illustrations underline the moral."
5,Lovable book,"If you want to inspire someone to be an artist... this is the bookIf you want to inspire someone to believe in himself/herself, this is the book!Cute, short, simple and sweet illustration. Just perfect!"
5,A Very Readable Survey,"Having read Colleen MaCullouch's fascinating series, I have tried to find what was truth and fiction. With Rubicon, I found what I was looking for. Other accounts I found tended to be very dry and brief. Rubicon, on the other hand, is a well-written popular history (in the best sense). The author converys the competitive nature of Roman society which worked well for a city state, but not an expanding empire, thus bringing about the end of the Roman republic."
3,Interesting narrative but words get in the way,"I was very excited to read this book because i had just finished reading The Persian Fire by Mr Holland but it was a dissapointed.Dont get me wrong,Mr Holland does a very good job telling us the story of the Roman Republic but the impression that i got was that he was just to enthusiastic about telling us the story.I believe that because the authors uses just too many words to describe places,situations,battles and other things that you lost track of the story.In other words,too many words and descriptions made the story of the Republic a liitle bit dull.I found myself hurrying thru unimportant paragraphs and pages to get to the more interesting parts.Maybe i like my history with a more direct approach.Nevertheless, Mr Holland does a good job at describing the personalities of the main players of the story and helps us get to know the way poeple lived and interact,especially the lifes of the politicians involve in that age."
1,Why Knock America?,The remark inside the jacket cover about America embarking on imperial ventures is uncalled for and an affront to EVERYONE who is an American citizen. It has NOTHING to do with one of the great figures in world history. This smug contempt for America smacks of jealousy.Avoid this book and the author.
5,Scary Parallels,"Following the fall of the Soviet Union, Americans went on a feeding frenzy just as the Romans did in the opening of Holland's book. We are plagued by corporate scandals of unprecedented magnitude. Our government plans to borrow trillions to extend the Great Society program to the rich. And, just like the Republic in its declining days, our leaders are removing our rights, burying our traditions, and dissolving the separation of powers.Holland's sense of humor -- he can be very funny -- makes this easy to swallow. But his remarks are painful nonetheless.Editing: Five Stars. Holland is a great writer and needs little editing.Copy Editing: Five Stars. Very Clean"
4,The REAL story....,"Rubicon, by Tom Holland, gives you the real story, the real history, about how the Republic of Rome fell. The book starts well before the crossing of the Rubicon and ends with the starting of what will be, in the end, the Roman Empire. Like most historical events, nothing happened in a day and many readers will enjoy the chain of events that brought about the major event that we have placed under the sentence - The Fall of the Roman Republic. It is complex, confusing and, in some cases, the details are unknown. When DID Caesar cross the Rubicon? Where IS the Rubicon? What were many of the people thinking, what were their goals, what did they want? We meet Brutus and Cleopatra, Spartacus and Virgil, Cicero and Augustus. Mr. Holland really helped me to understand the history. Those who enjoyed HBO's Rome and the many novels of the Masters of Rome series should pick this book up."
5,I Claudius - the Prequel,"Before I read this book my knowledge of Roman history was mostly confined to the twelve Caesars, thanks to Suetonius and Robert Graves. The Republic seemed very complicated and I didn't understand why the Romans felt such a sense of loss at its passing. After reading it, I now understand. For this I give it five stars and also for the fact that the book is very well-written and the author has a great narrative gift.As I'm not a scholar of Roman history I can't vouch for its accuracy, but I can't imagine there is a better introduction to the end of the Roman Republic."
3,Great narrative when it sticks to the actual history,"Very well-written, if sometimes given to prurient observation, this book argues persuasively the reasons the Roman Republic came to a bloody end. The character portraits are finely drawn, particularly those of Pompey, Cicero, Clodius and Sulla. The sourcing is solid, and the prose really reads like a novel. I recommend it highly, with the qualification that the use of 20th century slang to refer to death, body parts and sex obscure rather than enhance the author's otherwise sterling work"
4,"Readable, Entertaining Account of the Fall of a Republic","Tom Holland helps makes the fall of the Republic an exciting read in Rubicon. He is helped tremondously by the likes of Cato, Caesar, Pompey, Sulla, Cicero, and Cleopatra, among many, many other fascinating secondary characters, but it is his highly readable style that moves the story forward in ways that will be understandable for anyone encountering ancient Roman history for the first time and refreshing for those who are returing to this period of history. This is true pop history in the best sense of that meaning. The history comes alive in ways that will ring true and unmistakable to any reader now (without ever belabouring the obvious comparisons between the fall of the Roman Republic and our current events. History is never dead.) A recommended glimpse into the chaos that became Rome as its ideals for its society were subjugated by a quest for personal glory as its empire and its consequent chances for wealth grew."
2,What my history professors said never do...,"The book is overloaded with generalizing, personifying, and hyperbole, which simplifies and obscures the history. Some random examples: the Republic was exhausted and preoccupied; everyone knew; a ragbag of cities presumed; resentments seethed; the Romans judged; the plebians refused; community was cherished; peers wondered; Cato's ghost haunted the conscience of Rome. I felt frustrated that explanations and reasoning were being hidden from me."
1,Not Advised to Purchase,"Orange roughy can probably be called the world's most unsustainably harvested fish. This deepsea inhabitant, referred to by the name of 'slimehead' prior to marketing experts changing the name to 'orange roughy, is a slow-growing, long-lived fish. These fish do not reproduce until they are in their 20's and they live to 130+ years. When eating this fish, you may very well be eating a creature well over 100 years in age, from a population that has little chance of rebounding after initial harvests. On top of all this, the fishing practice used to capture these fish, namely deep sea bottom trawling, is one of the most destructive fishing practices known to humankind. Comparable to bulldozing down forests, huge nets equipped with heavy gear scrape along the sides of seamounts, removing ancient cold water corals and other benthic habitat. There is no excuse for ever eating this fish when there are so many alternatives."
3,Seem like a good product.,"The quality appears to be good. I think for my purposes, homeowner/hobbyist, these will be perfect and deserving of a 5. However, when I got these, the coating that was applied to the outside of these (not the paint, but the clear coating) had not completely cured. I took them out of the package only to find they were ""sticky"" and unusable at the time. I let them set up for a while and it got better, but it was still pretty irritating.Edit: I used the largest punch today to drive out the rivets that attach the ball joints to the control arm. I hit the punch with a several good blows from a 32 ounce ball peen and noticed that the punch was bent. To be fair, the rivets were in there pretty tight, but I finished them up with a punch from a much cheaper set without any damage. Also, the coating on the punches was still a little tacky."
2,disappointed,"This product arrived right before Christmas and I was very disappointed as it was a gift and one of the punches was missing. The biggest disappointment was that there was NO WAY TO CONTACT ANYBODY..i left an email for amazon and got a response to ""ship it back""...I just wanted the missing punch! A contact number somewhere on the web or on the packing slip would have been an awesome way to resolve this. Instead, we had to run around hardware stores trying to find a missing piece. It does make me a little concerned about ordering again from Amazon since there is no ""human"" contact phone number."
5,Great cymbal at a great price!,I got this Cymbal for the amazing price of $169! It was worth every penny. The sound is terrific and the finish is beautiful. It is basically Sabians version of the Zildian A Custom. The cymbal is great and I love it! Highly recommend.
2,DO NOT hit it hard or hold it by the rim,"I made the mistake of playing this like one of those ibo drums. Big mistake. I stood up at my drum set holding the rim and thumping the side hole...seconds later I had the rim in hand and shards of the drum were all over the drum booth and my snare. It's an okay and cheap jug, but it is NOT sturdy and it is not fired. It can't hold up its own weight from the rim. If you baby it, it's probably worth the $20 or so it costs."
2,Not that good,"This is defintiely one of his worst, if not his worst CD. The origianal songs are very forgetable. Plagued with very weak song writing. Does a nice job with Precious Love but besides that... very weak effort. Surprising because it was released between two very fine efforts."
3,Hostile Hauntings,"Most of the movies are low budget and very amateur. Never the less, I really enjoyed one in particular. Sleep Disorder, creepy, dark, haunting."
1,TOTALLY SUCKS,I rated this video one star only because I couldn't rate it lower. It's so bad it's impossible to watch it though. I put it though my shredder.
1,Hostile Hauntings is Hauntingly Horrible!,"Absolutely bad, bad, bad. Acting is bad - plots are bad! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!"
5,Balanced and Helpful,"This is said to be one of the best commentaries on Hebrews available. I am inclined to agree. This is not a devotional commentary such as MacArthur's or Matthew Henry's. Those are good for their purpose. If you are looking for a pastoral, technical commentary, look no farther. All the truths are presented that allow you to draw immediate application. I especially like Bruce's treatment of 2:6-9. He rightfully sees the quoted Psalm as messianic and fulfilled in Jesus as the last Adam. His comments on 3:15 are superb. I can't wait to finish out the book and apply all of the truths Hebrews has to offer. If you are studying Hebrews, you need this commentary."
4,!,Book arrived in stated condition and prior to est. arrival date. Good statements which causes personal reflection into one's actual thoughts.
3,Best of Earl Klugh,I accidently ordered the tapes astead of the CD. The company handled the matter very well. I was pleased with the service I received.
4,"Well-written, thought-provoking essays for general readers.","I enjoyed Paul Krugman's ""The Accidental Theorist"" a great deal. Each of the 27 essays is short, well-written, and thought-provoking. I especially liked ""What Is Wrong With Japan?"" and ""Looking Backward"", an astonishing piece written from the point of view of an economist looking back over the last 100 years from his vantage point in 2096.The author explains complex economic ideas in terms that laymen can easily understand. In ""Delusions of Growth"", he summarizes monetary policy by using a baby-sitting co-op as a model!Paul's viewpoint is from the left. I viewed this as a welcome change, a counterbalance to years of reading the conservative slant of the Wall Street Journal."
4,"A dismal start, an excellent end","I'm an aspiring economist; my first economics teacher referred this book to me as good summer reading material. I had a hard time reading the first half of the book; it felt like I was listening to someone running his or her fingernails on a blackboard. Mr. Krugman's comes across a bit to strident and fails to make it interesting reading for someone curious about economics. To his credit, starting with the articles in Part 4: Delusions of Growth, Mr. Krugman changes his tack and manages to captivate the reader with increasingly more interesting and relevant material. The last article, Looking Backward, is a masterpiece that is very provocative and deserves being revisited and thought about many times over."
4,Krugman is always fun to read,"Paul Krugman knows how to make economics interesting and he does it without dumbing down the material. He is deservedly well known for his ability to illustrate economic phenomena using creative and easily understood models. Of course you won't be worthy of a BA in economics after reading this, but you will be able to experience some of the complexities with which the field concerns itself. Some of his essays in this book tackle more complicated issues than others, but all of them are insightful and are a great opportunity for laypeople to find out how economists think about economic scenarios. And, as a bonus, Krugman's writing is rarely boring."
2,Principles Of Economics For A Layman.,The book is a brief introduction to economics. We can call it an intro. to economics for layman. Dr. Krugman draws anologies from some models(Like the hotdog and worker)which can hardly become model as such to draw an anology from. It also seems that Dr. Krugman hates Journalists.
1,Politics based economics based on faulty conclusions,"""Paul Krugman has been proclaimed the most celebrated economist of his generation..."" proclaims the back cover add. Celebrated by who? Maybe the former economic minister of the Soviet Union. Kruger's attacks on supply-side economics, and general good-for-business economic policies reveal a guy who might be an accomplished academic but has absolutely no common sense. Despite the 80 years of failure data that communist/socialist economic models provide a wealth of information on, we still have people that cling to these ideals. Like blind rats who cannot desert the sinking hulk of failure that centralization and management stupidity that is socialism, they cast about wildly, squeeking to the other blind rats. It is a small book, which was a relief"
4,"Good, as usual.","Very good in the sequel line, but I figured out ""who dun it"" before I finished. The characters are still developing well, waiting for the next one. I have the whole series."
2,yet another of the bit trite,"predictable, lots of words which take up a lot of pages. could have been eye candy, but fell short."
3,Mixed bag,"Again, the plot is interesting, as are the issues and locale, but the writing is still amateurish. Way too much soap opera, too many ugly characters, too much wailing and whining, misery and dysfunction, plus some cliche situations (like walking in on Vicky and John). And the solution is nonsensical. Worth the effort, but just barely."
3,"Great look, but not impressed with quality","I was looking for a nice blanket to go on the bunkbeds we have for our boys. I was excited to find these, and ordered two right away. In the photo the blanket looks bright orange, the color that came is more of a rust brown so that was a surprise. But they went with our decor so I kept them. Also, they do not seem to be very durable. You can see the base layer from which the fleece was made. I really like the blankets, just wish they were made with higher quality."
2,Savage Sickos,"I thought they were all pretty dumb. Disc Jockey was not terrible, but no Friday the 13th! I liked Lena Ramon. She's HOT!"
5,Best Webcam! Even better than the Logitech pro 4000,"I have many webcams and I recently got this one as a gift. It is amazingly great! However, at first I didn't know how to adjust the settings and thus make the video and pictures a bit dark. After the brightness, contrast, gamma, and quality... are set to the optimal setting, wow!!!!!!...it's like a good quality camcorder. My friend (from a foreign country viewing us on the webcam) was greatly impressed by the picture and video quality. He has the Logitech Pro 4000. He found mine is much better than his..."
3,Disappointing,"The previous reviews for this product are right on the money... This cam looks great in the daytime with the shades open, but once night falls, in order to use it , my computer desk has to look like a photographers studio.. I have several lights blinding me just to get a decent picture.. also I find I am constantly having to adjust light to make my image viewable. When I bought this cam, I also fell for the impressive stats, but they all go out the window at dusk.."
2,To dark,"I have a problem getting the cam to turn up the brightness. the adjustments don't seem to work.the camera doesn't work unless I point a bright light and what I'm taking a picture at, even in the daylight."
2,resolution not likely,"Just got the camera and read the fine print found only on the bottom of the box. It says, ""Resolutions supported by hardware for third party software compatibility. Not supported by Creative Studio."" The software it comes with only supports the usual 640x480 resolution. I didn't see any advantage from the optics or the USB 2.0 functionality, but then mine came with a busted focusing lens. I'm sure Amazon will take the return no problem, and the free shipping that was supposed to take 5-7 days miraculously brought me the camera in a single day, but I won't be ordering another one all the same."
1,Very Very Disappointed with the product,"Exchanged it for Logitech Pro 4000 (my original choice), only fell for it because of the impressive specs that was advertised..1.3 Megapixels, USB 2.0..etc.Complete waste of time and money (cost of return shipping)."
3,opt for the bigger dolls,"As I stated in the review for the Jeff version of this doll, the sound gave out in all of these dolls I purchased in only a few days. There is no way to open them up and replace batteries or anything, so once they stop making sounds, that's it. The reviews for the bigger Wiggle dolls were more favorable (I don't have them, so I can't comment) so I would recommend that you spring the extra money for the bigger dolls. These beanie ones don't last."
2,battery does not last long,These were very popular with my grandson but the noise or singing that they were suppose to do only lasted for about a week. All 4 wiggles dolls did the same thing so I would have to say that they are not made real well.
3,fairly quick read,"this book asked certain acts about certain songs and the stories behind them and it was cool for what it offered, however the book missed out on having more Black Artists in the stories and also there was a sense of empty space and air. now don't get me wrong what is offered works and is a quick read, however this could have been even more effective and left a lasting impact because books like this are alot of fun if done the right way all the way."
2,Not what I expected,"This book is definatley not what I expected. ""Stories"" are more about why or how the song was recorded and not about what the lyrics mean like I had hoped. Got about 15 pages in, and decided not to finish."
1,Writen in One Afternoon,"Stories? I don't think so. The ""story"" behind each song is simply a quote or two. The author didn't want to be burdened with the task of actually writing anything. And the quotes are frequently brief. The ""story"" behind Fleetwood Mac's ""Go Your Own Way,"" for instance, is all of four lines. This is book is mostly air. And as for ""Classic"" Rock, I humbly submit that songs like ""Substitute,"" ""That Smell,"" ""Treat Me Right"" by Pat Benetar have not exactly been labeled ""classic"" by anyone but Morse.I think what happened here is that Morse spend an afternoon on Nexus running searches for a bunch of songs and came up with a miscellaneous series of quotes from backdated issues of Rolling Stone. I feel ripped off."
4,Looking for more best-of song lists?,"For those interested in best-of song lists, also check out the following:Dave's Music Database presents: The Top 100 Songs of the Rock Era 1954-1999"
2,Not recommended for serious Java learner,"It tried to cover a lot of things Java can do, but it did not provide enough details and examples to show us how to do it. I read several Java books from the SUN press, but every time it disappointed me. I like Java programming a lot, don't mistaken me, but SUN's writers are not as good as some other publisher like the Waite group, or SAMS. Take a look at the book from BORDERS or B&N and you will understand."
3,"Good book to learn from, but too long","CoreJava 1.1 is a great book to learn Java from, although they explain each concept too much and that might be confusing to some users. Overall, if you know an OOP language or a language similar to C/C++, CoreJava is your book. I reccommend the 1.1 version rather than the 1.2 version because it deals with the still popular Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT) instead of the JFC which is slow, and not widely accepted. Plus you can read the swing connection to learn about the JFC (http://java.sun.com/)."
5,¡¡¡Es un libro excelente!!!,Considero que este es uno de los mejores libros en programación que he leido. Este libro debería ser considerado por aquellos desarrolladores que se consideren serios y profesionales.El único requisito que piden los autores es que los programadores cuenten con tan solo un poco de lógica y ganas de aprender a desarrollar en Java.
3,"good read, not much of a reference though.","I found this book to be a good read. The material contained within was well laid out, and well explained, and I would recommend this book to programmers who have had some programming experience before, but it seems rather complex for the beginner. On the down side however, the reference material is almost non-existant, and the index is all but worthless, so if you are looking for a book that is a reference volume, this is definately not it. So in terms of a shelf life, this books is really only good for the read."
5,Work of love,"It took me sooooo long to finish this book. I don't even know why, because I loved it.It didn't look like my type of book from the outside but at the end of the day it was SO up my alley.It's so beautifully written and God I can only hope to have a mind as open and attentive as Henry's. He has a great eye for detail and a wonderful way of making the simplest things seem like such complex and beautiful things. Which truly, they are, like when he wrote about the sand and it's movement, I was like ""really...?"" but then you keep reading and wow. Makes me want to leave everything and move somewhere to spend a year away from everyone and view the world as it was meant to be viewed, in it's natural and raw manner."
5,Beston is without a doubt the best!,I wouldn't dream of heading for the Cape without this book--Henry Beston captures the Cape more beautifully than any other author. THE OUTERMOST HOUSE is one of those enchanting books which improves with each rereading.
5,environmental treasure,"This was one of my winter reading books. I enjoyed it very much because the writing was very clear and vivid. Henry spent a year on Cape Cod writing about the nature and how the season changes the land and his surroundings. He writes about a lot of the birds that migrate in and out of the region and raises some important environmental concerns about the delicate nature of our actions on the wildlife. I appreciated the light hearted feel of the writing and it stuck to the middle of the road as far as imposing any of his personal opinions about all and any subjects, which I thought was safe and perhaps is the one of the negatives I feel for the writing. It was written with a modest sense of pleasure and feeling. It was in any sense, a very nice read and very indicative of the northeastern way of life."
3,I was a little disappointed with....,"this book. Maybe I expected too much from it. I very much enjoy books written with this premise. Anything from ""Sand County Almanac"" to ""Cache Lake Country"". This book just seemed too cosmic and too generic. Generic in the sense that there wasn't any linear thread through the work except cosmic descriptions of surf, wind and dunes etc, mixed with a smattering of bird information. I got the feeling the writer was too often trying too hard to be poetic. And as pointed out by another reviewer the descriptions of the surf and sand etc. wore thin pretty quick. I actually enjoyed the interaction he had with the coast guards and the descriptions of their work and how they went about it much better than the cosmic poetry! It isn't a bad book but for me it is strictly three stars and no more."
1,Nice for bedtime.,"This one put me to sleep. I'm planning to pass it along to someone who lives on Cape Cod. She may find it more enjoyable that I did. Our book club selected this and my guess is that the group will be split. Some will love the poetic descriptions of the birds and some will find that it put them to sleep. As I live near Lake Michigan and can hear the waves and fog horn at night, I loved that chapter. Otherwise, this was a struggle to finish."
3,old digimon,its cool i guess i like the new digidestend their asome pokemon digimon dragonballz im the girl of them all rika ken kari
3,basic introduction,"This book is a comprehensive catalog of Chinese weapons, with historical reference about its origins. Don't expect an explanation about weapon techniques, like those in others books of Dr. Yang (taiji chin na, Tai Chi theory & Martial Power). After you read this book you know that almost every thing was used for fighting purposes. Is for you, only if you're fan of martial weapons, and want a basic introduction to: long weapons, short weapons, soft weapons, projectile and throwing weapons, shields and armor."
3,Not much to say,Not much to say. It is what it is. Convenience is in the bulk rate. Don't have to purchase smaller quantities.
1,ZERO stars,"This book may be considered a classic, but it's a disgrace. Its stance on Enlisted members is pure prejudice. Just read its so-called ""advice"" for a commanding officer to give to an Enlisted member who wishes to marry a foreign national. The Navy should denounce this book and honor the many fine Enlisted members who defend our nation."
4,Italian in 10 Minutes a Day,"I know few languages but have never really spoken Italian, only watched a few movies. I am hoping to chat it up in Italy. I may not chat it up but with this book I will be able to defend myself. The whole concept of a little study everyday works and the variety of practice styles aid different learning styles. I have used this series to teach English as a second language and I have seen it start a non speaker."
2,Cute.,"Cute describes these books in the 10-mintues-a-day series. Pleasant, a little fun, a little insipid. But, really, not so bad just to get a taste of the language before you decide to move on to deeper study.Actually--in contrast to more than one other reviewer--I found the word-substitution presentation to be quite helpful in anchoring the meaning of the word into my memory. This is not an untried method, being also used in the EasyLearn Language audio programs, and other texts.Those word stickers don't stay on too long, though. Be prepared to lose a lot of them."
4,Very Useful,"This book really came in handy on our trip. The menu cut out cards and the flash cards proved to be very valuable to us, especially since a friend gave us the bad advice that everyone spoke some English. Don't believe that, there were a number of people that did speak some amount of English but we both wished that we had taken more time before our trip to learn a littlem ore of the language."
3,A Bit Misleading ...,"I somehow thought this book also came with CDs to help learn Italian. I was surprised to receive only the book in the shipment. Upon re-reading the description, the CDs are extra."
3,ITALIAN in 10 minutes a day,An ok workbook but the set of CDs of the same material is much more useful. (The publisher is Bilingual Books). We used the book in an Adult Ed Class. We found the lack of grammar explanations frustrating and supplemented this book with Mastering Italian Grammar and Hugo's Italian Complete which also has excellent CDs plus good descriptions of grammar.
5,a top merzbow album - this should be in your noise or odd music collection,"yes, i regularly listen to merzbow. and i listen to this album about once a month or so. sometimes more often. it goes great along with the Ikebana album, which is a collection of remixes of Merzbow by famous electronic and experimental musicians.if you scroll down, you'll read the review of ""14-year-old Movie fan and KIDZ BOP hater."" If you think he's an idiot, you'll probably like this album. By the way, my Canada includes Texas, ""Scott.""-VoodooArtist"
3,...and yet the price tag is $99.00?,"Truly I cannot review this product, ignore any stars. Pardon the sarcasm but the price tag of this product is a bit numbing...at best. I am curious to see the work but the tag keeps me at bay. Unemployment does not permit such a high costly purchase."
5,good book,"I received this workbook Unused, not filled in good book, what I needed and was looking for. fine condition. Thank you"
5,Great for Kenny Rankin fans.,"It's great to get it on CD, since I only ever saw it before on cassette tape. This is the least expensive of all the ""early"" albums you're likely to find. It's great for all of his fans and fans of vocal ""jazz"" in general.I particularly like a song called ""Down the Road"" featuring back-up vocals by David Crosby. Kenny does a couple of Marvin Gaye songs, ""Trouble Man"" and ""Let's Get It On."" His fans will love them with his unique twists on these tunes, but maybe they shouldn't be the first introduction to his music for the neophyte fan.We really like Mr. Rankin, and have had the pleasure of seeing him live. It's so sad it will never happen again. The prices for his stuff have jumped, so it'll take us longer to fill in the rest of the collection than it normally would."
4,80's Rankin,"I'm a HUGE Kenny Rankin fan, and this album is hard to find...Kenny Rankin hadn't made an album in about 8 years then busted back out on the scene with this album."
2,"Ah, can't blame Rankin for ""Hiding Inside Himself""","DOWN THE ROAD was likeable in a latter day James taylor kind of way.For this effort Kenny welcomed back John Sebastian and David Crosby.He is suported also by Lee Sklar, Robben Ford, Steve Lukather, and David Benoit,And I liked his cover of TROUBLE MAN in particular.A second Gaye cover (LET'S GET IT ON) was pretty tepid;if this is how Kenny gets it on, he can't be much of a catch.Reminded me of how Eric Clapton butchered LAYLA on his UNPLUGGED CD 25 yrs after shreading it with Derek & the Dominoes. CLAPTON turned a ripping cry of love about cuckling another man's wife (George Harrsion's)into a country ho-down on his own blasphomase live re-make. Yuck!Overall Kenny Rankin's Hiding Inside Myself is directionless and sappy.Um, Kenny, gee, can sound voacally like Boz Scaggs, but seems void of soul to these ears. File Rankin under ""Smooth Jeez"".Like salsa with out the spice, i'll el paso on this one."
5,Done it Again!,"On this cd, Quik has pleased me again. This cd has a lot of jammin' songs. My personal favorites are: Well, Roger's Groove, How Come, Did Y'all Feel Dat, and a few others. I was very pleased with this cd. I couldn't of asked for more. Quik has a lot of talent. I am a true fan of DJ Quik, and will always be. So, go buy it and feel the great experience of DJ Quik!"
4,West Coast,"This album is trill. DJ Quik is probably the best producer from the West coast. One of best in tha game now. This album is on a different vibe then most Rap albums. Balance & Options is like Jazz & Rap mixed together, and it is mixed beautifully. I like all tha tracks equally but the ones that really stand out are Change Da Game, Did Yall Feel Dat?, Pitch On A Party, Well, Quik's Groove, Do I love Her, & Divorce Song. Defenity a must for fans of mellowed out muzik. deffinitly somethin to Ride to."
3,Back to Walmart,Quick needs to move out of Compton and up to Oakland. Maybe get some attitude back.I totally dig this artist. Always original but getting a bit stale with this one. The beats sound tired. 3 stars for consistency.
5,DJ Quik's Masterpiece,"""Balance and Options"" is easily the most underrated rap CD of the year, a stunning tour-de-force masterwork that shows DJ Quik to be not only much more than the round-the-way-thug with a passion for alcohol of his early hits, but a genius producer with a mind-boggling array of colors on his palette of tracks. Nothing in his admittedly pleasant and listenable catelogue could have prepared you for this superb hip hop recording. The arrangements are muscular and ever-changing, from the manifesto ""Change Da Game"" to the dance-floor holla, ""Pitch In Ona Party"" to the smooth instrumentals ""Roger's Groove"" (that's Troutman, y'all) and ""Quik's Groove V"" to the bangin' ""Do Whatcha Want."" There is not a lame track on this CD, with the exception of the barely audible interludes. This one is in the running for rap recording of the year. It's that good."
3,cut short,"I have read to page 310, a little over half way and have enjoyed the read but there are 33 pages missing (311 - 342) and then the text repeats (343 -374) twice. I am disappointed to say the least. My immediate thought was the author and or publisher lacks credibility.Don't know what else to say."
2,B o r i n g,"The minutia of his life and family was tedious to read, and on the whole, it was a really boring book. His religious nature was overly represented too. This book was not what I was expecting."
2,dont do it,this is not a book i would tell anyone to read..nothing in this i found helpfull at all. i forced myself to finish it. i found myself bored in it wondering why i was not learning anything about edgar cayce other than that he had a wife and 2 children. do yourself a favor & do not buy this book
2,Only My Personal Bias,"What a yawn fest. A non-fiction book that reads like a work of fiction? Sorry to bring down the rating but personally, I hate most fiction, and this writing style turned me off. The author pretty much lays out the entire story in the first few chapters, and then I feel like I'm reading L. Ron Hubbard with setting and narration by John Steinbeck.Though if this is what you're looking for buy the book! I haven't heard a book more highly recommended about Edgar Cayce than ""The story of Edgar Cayce: There is a river.""It just wasn't for me."
5,Story of Edgar Cayce: There is a River,"I believe more people in America and the world should know about Edgar Cayce and his healing ministry.This book is an inside story into the life of this amazing man, that some have considered the American Nostradamus.I am not saying much more than read it!"
5,Life Changer,"Straight up, this is a book that will have an incredible impact on you, regardless of your religious beliefs. Edgar Cayce was a very devoted Christian, a man afraid and confused of the gifts given to him. But by learning how to turn his incredible abilities into pathways of healing, he fulfilled his destiny, and gave the world a new insight into our place in the universe. Written by a credible source, this book is fascinating, stunning and deeply impacting. Do yourself a favor: read it, and then give it to everybody that you know."
5,If you can only afford one book on Edgar Cayce...,"If you can only afford one book on Edgar Cayce, then this is the one to purchase. I have read every book in the library on the sleeping prophet. This book was publishing orignally in the 1940's and is written by a person who actually knew Edgar Cayce.This book provides a history of Mr. Cayce from birth to death and provides the essentials for understanding who, what, when, and where of the sleeping prophet. Once you have that basic history of the man, then you can more easily concentrate other areas that he addressed such as healing, Atlantis, Egyptians, prophecy, etc."
3,The Story of Edgar Cayce : There is a River,Still in the midst of reading this at a frriend's suggestion - VERY interesting read. From the little I did read I would recommend it!
1,LOOK FOR THE HDMI LOGO,"There is a wealth of information on the HDMIxCOM industry homepageHave a look at the Manufacturer and Consumer pagesIn order for HDMI cable manufacturers to display the ""HDMI"" logo a licensing process must be successful. This process includes tests so that the cable meets the HDMI standard.From the website:Does HDMI accommodate long cable lengths?Yes. HDMI technology has been designed to use standard copper cable construction at long lengths.. Cable manufacturers are expected to sell REASONABLY PRICED copper cables at lengths of up to 15 meters.If it's good enough for the HDMI logo then its good enough for you. There are many certified HDMI brands selling at 1/5th the cost of Monster"
3,Hey you!,I should have known better! My ineptitude with numbers overcame some of the simplest concepts in this book. Perhaps those with a modicum of intelligence would fare better.
5,I love this book,"I just wanted to say that this book is great, from beginning to end. Definitely earned all five stars in my estimation."
4,excellent compendium of math facts and puzzles,This book really hits the mark. Pickover is best at gathering short interesting math topics and spicing them up with plenty of neat puzzles and interesting quotes.Great stuff!
1,Is absolutely clueless about mathematics,"Let me elaborate the title of my review with an example directly out of his book (the exponent might be different in the book):Pickover claims that n=10 is the only integer for which 5^n x 2^n = 10^n. What the...This was the worst mathematics mistake I found in his book, and I can't really think of a worse one he could have made. Other than this, the book has a typo on almost every page. I enjoyed reading it when I was young, but it is absolute BS."
5,Draws you in,"This is an excellent read which has a magnetism that draws you in to a world of the supernatural, and has the reader believing that these events might actually be possible.Hard to put this book down. Very suspenseful!"
1,Just when you think it can't get any worse...,"it does!Really, this has to be the worst book I ever forced myself to read. The writing is juvenile and the plot is a jumble of ""wouldn't it be awesome if"" events.i cannot comprehend the 4 & 5 star reviews, unless they came from the authors family. Run as fast as you can from this book!"
4,Good story,"Well written, and exciting reading, I will read more books from this author anytime. It keeps you interested in what happens next"
2,A Stretch,"I did not read the previous book, so context was difficult to attain until I read half way through. The entire concept seemed highly implausible! l know its fiction but there has to be some foundation in reality. The whole witch thing, demons that fly, ancient worlocks? The setting was also a problem for me Florida then DC then back to Florida. Disappointed."
2,Save your money!,"Poor writing, poor editing, confusing plot. Sorry, but I did not enjoy. Unexplained magic and gratuitous sex. Save your money!"
2,a narrative of no flow,"I'm the sure that the main draw to this book concerns the seedy, gangster underworld of Chicago. I don't know if I have enough patience to get there; the narrative so far relates sound-bite stories of the founders, urban planners, and architects who first erected this city. It's extremely interesting material, but Johnson's flits over it all in barely readable, fragmented prose. Furthermore, as one unfamiliar with the city (especially as it was in the 1800s), his descriptions of the landscape (and the design of the buildings) leaves me still with a black box imagination of what the city looks like. Pictures or illustrations would well suit the understanding of this book, which would lead to the (hopeful point of the story) understanding of the city."
5,classic,good transfer. i grew up watching these episodes. sound quality is awesome. recommend this to old or new fans. thundercats is based on the Conquest of Mexico by the mars people with Big belt buckles with cats on them
3,Glad it's on DVD!!!,"Was there a better time to be a kid than the 1980's? Thundercats was one of the best shows of that era, and this is a great set-- contains 33 episodes from the 1985 season. Nostalgia set in as soon as I saw the first episode which I have not seen in years. WB who released the set usually do a good job with TV on DVD packages. I typically like my season sets to be in Digi packs instead of three individual keep cases, but that's a small gripe. There are some audio issues, and a bit of grain-- but I'll take it anyway I can get it. At least you can be sure that the show will see all of the episodes released unlike Rhino shows (JEM and GI Joe, anyone). I look forward to season 1 pt. 2 this fall."
2,"I do not dispute that the show itself is great, but the DVDs are a different story...","Thundercats was one of the better series of the 1980's. I will not dispute that in any way, shape, or form.BUT the quality of the audio/video is VERY much lacking. The episodes were not remastered. I might as well watch my old VHS tapes. The sound quality is low as well. It would seem to be mono, not stereo, sound. Also, as one other person pointed out, the music is missing from one of the episodes. That's a huge error.I'm sorry, but Warner Brothers? You made a huge mistake releasing it like this. I'm incredibly disappointed.I recommend the rest of you go find the old VHS tapes, because they're cheaper than this and about the same quality."
3,WHY? Laziness! Disappointing.,"We all know that the release is subpar, due to the lack of digital remastering. HOW could Warner Bros. not remaster a show that is over 20 years old (created in 1983)? I dunno. But everyone who is dissatisfied, please take the time to go to the Warner Bros webpage and contact them through the Tech Help section under Help. If you want them to release a REMASTERED Thundercats, we need to stop complaining and start telling WB how we want this show to be remastered. If enough people complain, they will remaster the show. So don't wait for everyone else to contact WB, you gotta help too.This show deserves to be remastered. Transformers was. But they added in extra, crappy sounds."
4,ThunderCats Season 1 Part 1,I am so happy this was released I live in Australia and have been waiting for it for at least 3 years. I was a little disapointed that the picture quality wasn't restored at all and that the second eppisode is missing its soundtrack in the english language. I love the box for these DVDs the front is holographic so the light looks like it crashes around the sword of Omens. I was also impressed that the discs work on Australian DVD players without the need to reburn them or get your DVD player modulated. If you live in Australia you can get a copy form http://www.theempire.com.au/. So although it is a flawed set it is better than nothing so I thank WB for releaseing it but think they need to up the bar for the next release.
4,Just like the ones we got from Netflix,"We'd rented a copy from Netflix. After we sent it back, my son begged to see it again, so we bought a copy. It's the same quality as the cartoon when it was first shown, as far as I can remember. Some of the other reviews complained that it wasn't cleaned up to their satisfaction. I didn't notice."
5,Back to 1985!,"Son and I watched Thundercats back in the day...now we have them for the Grandson and he sings ""Thunder. Thunder. Thundercats HO! It's fabulous! Can wait to gather coins for Season Two Vol. I."
5,thundercats hoooooo!,I grew up watching this cartoon. I love it. Its timeless. Even today this is a cartoon that kids still love. My little cousins go crazy for it.
4,Thundercats.. Ho!,"After having read some of the reviews for this boxset I was tempted to simply buy a bootleg version of the entire series. Mono soundtrack? Not remastered? How cheap..I decided to go with this series and overall am happy that I did. In a nostalgic kind of way, I am almost glad these episodes are not remastered. I was a fan of the grainy animation and still am. It would've been great if the audio was 5.1 but it a non-issue for me.I was hoping I would receive a fixed version of episode 2 (no music!) but I did not. I ended up watching it in Spanish with english subtitles (Thundercats in Spanish - Hilarious).Overall I am very happy with my purchase and I can't wait for the next volumes coming out. The most bothersome thing about this boxset is that Lynx-O, Bengali, and Pumyra aren't in any episodes."
5,One of my favorite TV show on the 80's,I was waiting for for this a lone time ago. Now my son love this show to and he is only four. Go Thundercats...
5,It's about time,"First off I just want to say that it is about time that one of the best cartoon shows of my generation is put on DVD. I love the Thundercats, I never missed an episode when I was growing up. It's to bad that kids nowa days don't have the quality cartoon shows that we had. I can't wait till the rest of the episodes and seasons are put on DVD. Snarf, Snarf!"
2,not so great a release,"don't get me wrong. i love this show. its one of my favorites from childhood. i remember watching it on tv. i remember the videos. and i was expecting the dvds to blow me away. dvds usually do that. but this show didn't. the transfers aren't that great. in the first episode there are tracking issues in the tape they transferred it from. that just isn't something that should be tolerated from dvds. i understand this is an older show, but they could have done more than i could do in producing this dvd. it truly is disappointing.that said, the shows are still awesome. glad they are finally out.but in the future, distributors shouldn't be allowed to do this sort of shoddy releases."
2,What a ripoff!,"I must say I was pretty dissapointed on this release. The folks at Warner Bros didn't do a good job on bringing this title out on DVD.There some glitches with the release. Firstly some scenes, there are screen shakes. Secondly the music is missing from some of the episodes!!! What the?? This is not good enough. Warner bros, get your act together and release a proper unedited, uncut series! This is not good enough. What a waste of money. Hopefully the next set will be in the good books."
1,THUNDERRUBBISH!! HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"C'MON, ITS THE 2000'S, WE CAN HAVE IT ALL! - SO, IN CASE YOU WONDER IF ITS WORTH THE MONEY, EVEN IF YOU DONT MIND THE HORRIBLE QUALITY OR THE LACK OF DOLBY/5.1 BECAUSE OF ""THE-MORE-IT-RESEMBLES-THE-OLD-STUFF-THE-BETTER"", WELL:NO"
1,about the defective cd,if the cd is defective why amazon dont stop releasing this dvd and release A GOOD ONE WITHOUT THE DEFECTIVE CD and save customers EFFORTS TO GET THE GOOD ONE FROM WB???? i think its amazon RESPONSIBILITY to sell GOOD PRODUCTS
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY!!!,"It's amazing the difference between studios. The He-Man dvd release is a perfect, high quality, low cost, well thought out release. What does this have to do with Thundercats? Just to show you the exact opposite of what the Thundercats release it. Low quality, High priced, not one penny spent on improving it. This is a horrible release. I hope they realize what they've done and re-release a remastered set after admitting how wrong they were. SHAME ON YOU WB!5 stars for the content, Thundercats was one of the best cartoons of the 80's.1 star for the DVD set."
5,Can't Wait!!!,"This DVD is long overdue! Finally Thundercats fans are given the respect they deserve! This is the first of Many Boxed sets for the Thundercats series and is a MUST buy! there is confirmation of volume 2 and rumours of the entire set being released by 2006, but Make sure all you other Thundercats fans buy this so that we are guaranteed to see the entire series get released on dvd! it would be such a shame for it to be slumped half way because of poor sales! so all you fans out their remember to do your part! Thundercats HOOOO!!"
1,any info on replacement disc 1?,any info on replacement disc 1? (missing soundtrack)? you know its really strange how much better the show is with the soundtrack . the one episode is kinda boring without it. wb should put a replacement disc in volume 2.. but that would be the right thing to do and we know they are not about that. after what they did with tom and jerry saying it was uncut and when you play it well we know that story.they ofered a replacement disc for that and i never got it
4,The Best in the series!,"I like the workout. No- it is not the hardest workout, no they do not cue like professionals and no they are out of step sometimes, but I still like it! This is a good mat-based body-area focussed workout. It is fun and different too. It has four segments: Abs, Legs, Arms, and Butt. each segment is about 20 minutes and it works the body out nicely for a light toning day! I also have Bootcamp-that one is a good low/med impact circut style workout with some light toning intermixed. I have not tried Booty Bounce yet. To bump up BODY- use light handweights for the Arms and Abs segments!"
1,"The Language Doesn't Bother Me, But the Workout is LAME!!!","If I could give zero stars, I would have.First of all, why would you put a picture of a woman holding weights on the cover of a workout DVD when there are no weights used in the workout?Secondly, the ladies keep talking about what a tough workout you're going to have. Nope. Sorry. Didn't even break a tiny sweat.Finally, you can use the word ""A**"" all you want, it doesn't make you edgy or dangerous. In this case, it comes off as desperate and lame.I think the 15 minutes are over for these skinny bitches."
1,Boring,"I got this video from a friend and we both thought the title was hilarious. Skinny Bitches is a regular part of our vocabulary. So I really thought this video was going to kick my butt. It did not. This is not a hard core work out video. I definitely didn't break any kind of sweat, no real cardio, no weights. The instructors are horrible. I do take into account that they are not real aerobics instructors but this is just plain awful. There is no cueing and the little bit of cueing that they give is not enough information to let understand the next move. The video is broken up into 4-20 minutes segments but like another review mentioned the arms and abs are only 15 minutes long. I do think the video is good for someone who is just starting to exercise to get their bodies used to muscle movement but in my opinion you just get a nice stretch out of the video. Don't waste your money. There are so many other great workout videos out there!!!"
3,I love this dvd!,"The first time I did this dvd I thought it was ok, but too much chatter. But I kept coming back to it and now they just make me laugh and I'm able to do a whole hour of exercise without hating it. It may be amateurish but I think that makes them seem more real. This is one dvd that I'll keep doing on the days I don't go to the gym."
1,Rubbish,"There are a ton of real workout out there. This is not one of them. A lot of talking. It was not challenging at all.I wish I was advised not to waste my 15 bucks at Borders. Pure rubbish, don't waste your money."
1,Why have music if you don't follow the rythm?,"Although the workout was OK, there were two things that bugged me like crazy. First, there is some annoying music in the background and the instructors don't follow the beat in the music. It was tough following their instructions when the music was in a different tempo. Second, the instructors kept on saying ""namaste"", although they were not even close to doing yoga."
5,Great Workout!,I saw this series advertised on the Tyra show and ordered it. I luv the workout and it does really give results if you stick to it!
2,Not a Good Workout Video,"The workout sets on this DVD go too fast for most people that aren't already experienced in exercise routines. Even if you were, the steps are not explained slowly enough so you end up having to watch the DVD a decent amount of times to try to 'pick up' on what the instructors are doing. It doesn't seem like they know what they're doing, honestly, because both myself and my mother were injured after failed attempts of trying to keep up with them. This will probably work out for someone who picks things up quickly and already knows proper exercise protocol so they don't hurt themselves. But it seems like they are missing their mark with their target audience- which is amateurs- when they are not treating the audience as if they are new to fitness training."
1,You've got to be kiddin' me!,"It is amazing to me that these two clowns even have an exercise DVD; they have to be the laughing stock of the exercise world. I only picked up this DVD b/c my neighborhood bookstore went bust and it was 1/2 price (I'm even mad I paid that much). I thought I'd be able to do the arm segment daily ..... it's a mess! Why would you want to work your arms without weights? It's plain to see they made their own arm exercises with no choreography and they're not even on tempo with the music. They don't even explain the segment; all of a sudden, there's arms flying in every direction. Their banter is even nauseating. If these two can put together an exercise video, so can I. This one ended up in the trash!"
4,Laws's best album,"Buy it for the original version of Tidal wave alone (the basis for the unforgettable hook in Black Moon's ""Who Got Da Props?"" Funky source of some great rare grooves."
5,"very nerve-raking,makes a peson think,& mysterious","The Cold One is very exiting. Thought, I wouldn't recomend it for children adults would enjoy this book very much. This book is very mysterious. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."
4,What Happened to Christopher Pike????,I read this book back when it first came out. I have read all of his books even though I am 22. I recently reread it and discovered it was suppose to be a series. Where did Christopher Pike go? What happened to the rest of the series? Why did he stop writing? If anyone knows please fill me in. The book is very good though. But if you dont want to get stuck wanting the rest of the books then dont read.
4,"Profound, catching","I really liked this book, it's great. I didn't really like the ending because it wasn't very good, but I suppose it's got to be like that for the second book. PS..DOES ANYONE KNOW WHEN THE SECOND PART, ""SEEDLING"", IS SUPPOSED TO COME OUT AND WHERE TO GET IT??????"
4,Spellbinding and unforgetable.,The Cold One is one of the best books I've read . I was unable to stop once I started. Chrisopher Pike has done it again. I can't wait to read the next book
4,The Cold One,"Warning: Do not read this book if you don't like confusing plots! I personally loved the Cold One, it was sort of a mystery novel. The whole book doesn't tie together until the very, very end. I made the mistake of reading the last page first, as is my bad habit, and it ruined the story for me, so don't read ahead! The beginning of the book starts out spooky and that 'spookiness' continues for the length of the book. I didn't really have a favorite character, they were all pretty awesome, especially Sara. She ends the book with an unexpected twist! Very unexpected! You'll know the twist if you read the book which I highly recommend."
3,"Creepy & Choppy & Juvenile, Yet Strangely Enjoyable","This type of horror is not usually my cup of tea, but something about this book made reading it like eating potato chips--you can't stop after just one page. I'm embarrassed to admit that I really enjoyed it, but I gotta be truthful."
4,Pike's - THE COLD ONE,"This book was a pretty interesting one. The only thing that I can really complain about is that it dragged on for way too long. I am well aware that Christopher Pike uses his details to enhance the quality, but sometimes it just gets on the nerves of the reader. At the end, I was on the edge of my toes to find out what happens. Instead, he says that there is going to be a sequel. I was kind of dissapointed.The characters were quite interesting and my favorite would have to be Leslie. Evil and good interwined is my kind of story. I hope that in the future Mr. Pike realizes that details that are trivial should be omitted."
5,AWESOME BOOK,I [] LOVED THIS BOOK!!! I never wanted to put it down. Where is the sequal though? The only part that kinda was boring was all the Hindu stuff. Other than that read this book. Even if you're not a Pike fan. It's soooo good.
3,Burrell Awesome ... but the piano needed a tuning,"A lot of great atmosphere on this location recording and Burrell's playing can't be faulted: it's deeply soulful yet tasteful. But the poor piano needed a good tuning! It sounds completely out of whack and it's very distracting. That said, ""Beef Stew Blues"" is my fave cut."
3,surprising!,"After buying and listening to Burrell's really outstanding record ""Blue Midnight"" I expected much more. But exept ""SWINGING"" it is an average album. I would not miss it..."
3,Good but only for BEGINNERS,"I read so many great reviews about this video that I was pretty excited about it whipping my abs into shape. It's still a good video but I was disappointed to discover how low key it is. I'm not an avid exerciser (haven't hit the gym in... 5 months?) but I basically end up spending the whole video making up my own variations to make it more intense. On the positive side, its segmented style makes it great if you only have 5 or 10 minutes to spend on your abs but if you want to do more or even the whole thing, the segments get annoying. They stop and do stretching and cool down for a few minutes in each segment and then it takes 30 seconds to switch to the next segment and you start all over again."
3,Tummy workout is ok,"I bought this thinking it was the original abs of steel with tamilee webb, but it wasnt. The dvd is ok but not as good as the webb one. They shouldnt have marketed this dvd with the same name."
2,Don't bother....,"Not worth it... no sit ups or intensity with this video... The only part I actually felt a little burn in my abs was the last yoga segment, which was about 10 minutes. If you are looking for a good ab workout, check out the Exhale Core Fusion workouts... a real good ab workout for 10 minutes...."
1,no work,Did not like the dvd at all! I did not feel like I got a workout. It was a waste of my time.
2,Mixed Signals,"I've read other reviews and heard many say this is only good for beginners; however after just now popping in the DVD I found that it's far too complicated for this beginner. Well, I'm not really a beginner, I've used In Home Walking, Tae Bo, and lots of Richard Simmons videos, but this one is just too involved. You start off with what seem to be very easy movements and then all of a sudden the instructor is doing five-six part movements, talking a mile a minute, and moving even faster. I skipped to the next section of the dvd and it was no better.I may try it again in the future when I'm more in agile, but for now I feel that I wasted my money."
3,Not For Beginners,I love Leisa Hart. I used the original Abs of Steel video/VHS and loved it! This DVD is for people who already have rock hard abs or you are close to having it. Or people who want to maintain their abs. I liked the original DVD for beginners. I thought this would be a continuation but I was wrong. The moves are harder. Not for the beginner.
2,Not worth the money,I got this DVD hoping it would help me lose some inches around my mid section. This DVD does me absolutely no good. It may be good for beginners but not for me. I've done all the exercises several times and have seen no results and feel absolutely no burn. This was a complete waste of my money. If you're looking to get your body into great shape you should try P90X. This stuff will kick your butt and get you into great shape.
5,The Long Green Line,"Coach Joe Newton is a long-time close friend, an outstanding gentleman and coach. His record as the winningest cross-country track coachn in the US is amazing, but what's more important mis his ability to motivate his team members to do their utmost, way beyond what each boy may have even thought he could accomplish. Coach Joe of the Dukes of York is in high demand as a motivational speaker throughout the country. This is an outstanding movie about an outstanding human being.Lee AyersGoodyear, AZ"
4,Good Grid,"The two cooling racks I got seem really nice. They are non-stick, which is nice, but they do not have legs that would allow you to stack them, so you need a fair bit of counter space for two of these and whatever cookie sheet you may be taking out of the oven.They have a fairly tight grid, so I hope my soft cookies will not drip through, but they do bend under the weight of three pumpkin pies (granted two where in pie tins, but the third was in heavier corningware).I have been washing them by hand, as I am not sure how to fit them in the dishwasher with anything else."
3,no center support,"No fault of the Mfr, I just wish I was more careful with my purchase cause I have something like this at home but needed a couple more. The one I already have has center support cross members, these do not. These do function just fine for light load but when I start piling on fresh homemade posta or a fresh loaf of bread I saw it bow in middle then I realized the design differances I overlooked. This version is fine, just not all around duty usable."
4,perfect size for my oven,"This is very efficient and the perfect size for my oven. However, the cooling rack and cookie should should be packed differently. The cooling rack dented the cookie sheet in shipment."
3,"It's okay, but doesn't fit inside sheet pan","This cooling rack was advertised as being recommended to be ordered with the Johnson-Rose 2/3 sheet pan (20 x 15). I ordered both items, but the rack does not fit inside the pan...the cooling rack is too wide."
5,it cools well!,Great cooling rack. Only used it once but cooled muffins and cookies - worked great. Rinsed very well by hand. So far I'm very happy with this product.
3,Samples are in DTS audio format,3 stars is really 1 star for the samples only. I don't actually have any idea and won't buy it on blind faith.This is just a comment on the audio samples provided by Amazon for DTS recordings. I don't know about everyone else but my computer does NOT have a DTS decoder built into it and even if it did I doubt the samples would find their way to it. All you get is white noise.Merry Christmas
3,ok wrist coach,"I use this product for work. There are many manifests and paper items that I must keep up with during operations. I can store these in product without losing them. Although, space is Very limited inside sleeve of product. I end up sometimes, having to fold paper just to get it inside sleeve."
4,Not a flop!,"No matter what the ""critics"" say, this is a very good Tracy and Hepburn movie. It dates back to WWII, but shows that time period very well. Tracy and Hepburn always have the chemistry and their gradual discovery that they care for one another in this movie is charming. Also, Lucille Ball is wonderful as a smart-talking real estate agent. She certainly adds zest! Well worth watching."
3,without love,"I wasn't paying attention, did not realize that it wasVHS. Will have to wait to actually view it when I have access to a VCR."
4,"Good movie, but there was a remake","As always, the Tracy/Hepburn movies are always wonderful to watch, no matter the plot. The remake of this movie is ""The Mirror has Two Faces"" with Jeff Bridges and Barbra Streisand, which I actually have to say I enjoyed more than the original."
3,fair effort,"Tim's older recordings from the '70s are better. This is also short. I wish he would team up with a singer, songwriter or band. He's very talented. OK to listen to occasionally, but that's about it."
2,round and round,"I was looking for a book which would give me several practical exercises to help improve the quality of my voice. I found the book poorly organized and the exercises do not come until 3/4 of the way through the book. It is not that clear which exercises to start with and the exercises refer back to philisophical points made in the first 180 pages. I did not want to have to wade through pages and pages of discussion about the voice and simply wanted a ""how to.""This book is good if you are very interested in the subject of voice training and want to spend a lot of time thinking and reading about the voice. The exercises make up only one chapter, and there are not diagrams, or pictures for learners who are more visually oriented."
1,a mess,A lot of gobbledy gook. Sounds like the author wants to be a therapist. 3/4 of the book is psycho babble. Exercises are not helpful. A waste of money.
4,Simple and best,This is a very good product of my taste. I am a person who like something plain and simple yet durable and strong; made to serve purpose. This satisfies everything. I am happy!
5,Pretty good for Scooby fans,"I thought this title was pretty good, though it wasn't as good as Zombie Island, which is still the best of the new movies they've been putting out. The humor in this film is great. And it's a throwback to the episodes. If you like Scooby-Doo, check this title out. I think you'll like it."
4,Good fun for kids,"This was pretty cute and funny, really if I could have I would have given it 3.5 stars, but there's not half star rating here.All in all, it was well put together.. had the vein of fun from the old Scooby Doo cartoons I grew up on. The various worlds they visited during the adventure added to the story and kept you from getting bored of one scenario. I freely admit, I am more partial to the older ones.. they just seem a little more solid to me than the current ones, but overall I think this is good for kids to watch, they would have fun with it and learn a few things along the way."
4,Can't Go Wrong With This One,"I've rented about every Scooby video, but this is the one my kids always want to see - so I bought it. As another reviewer wrote, it's good enough to watch with your kids - at least the first couple of times! For those of you (like me) who are always curious who does the voices, there is a great bonus feature behind the scenes worth watching!"
1,"Scooby Doo, What are you doing in this boring movie?","My son is a huge Scooby Doo fan,so we rushed out to buy this DVD and it was a big disappointment. The last movie (""Scooby Doo and the Alien Invaders"") was so much better. This one is just repetitive and tedious. I pretty much found it unwatchable. I realize that at 38, I'm not the target audience, but I've had no trouble sitting through the last two movies, over & over & over again with my kids. Save your money!"
5,Really Fun - Not Too Scary,"My kids love this one - ages 2, 4, & 6. They all watch it and aren't too scared. This has a fun ending where the gang meets a cyber-version of themselves and they help each other solve the mystery. Great fun!"
5,"Good price,great movie","Bought this as part of my daughters birthday gift and she loves it! Worth the $,great buy. Especially if you love Scooby<3"
2,Not for Children under 5,"Anything that scares children, or tries to create action in this manner gets my thumbs down. This is no exception. Sorry Scooby fans, but this is inapproriate for young children, unless you like getting up in the middle of the night with your three year old."
4,A pretty good intro book in a subject without many of them,"This is a fairly good catch-all intro to many basic topics in the philosophy of language. While it's a little lacking in the overall structure department, the different chapters for the most part provide useful overviews of their respective topics (e.g. definite descriptions, radical translation, etc.). I'd say it might be good if you knew a little about philosophy of language before picking this up, but the only intro more accessible than this I can recommend is ""Philosophy of Language"" by Lycan. Given the lack of good entry-level surveys in this subject, I'd recommend this if you're starting out in the field and want to learn more about the subject."
1,I adore Sondheim and I hated this DVD!,"The music is, of course, amazingly wonderful and the performers are exceptional, and the camera man should be shot!Sondheim music is complex and riveting but the camera person changed shots every 2 or 3 seconds. The camera angle changes several times in one phrase. During the lively dances the camera angle changed so many times that I actually got sick to my stomoch.Once they made 42 camera angle changes during a single performance by Mandy Patinkin. I couldn't take any more. I couldn't turn it off because I love the music so much so I survived by only listening and not watching the remainder of the production. Shame on the producers for allowing such a crime! They had the ingredients for a superb and precious documentation and they ended up with a horrid and frustrating experience. My recommendation would be to save your money and buy the CD instead."
3,NEW YORK VERSUS LONDON,"I don't know how many birthday tributes there have been to Sondheim on his 80th birthday but I have only seen two. The first one was given at the 2011 London Proms and the second was the present one under review and I have to say that the New York version doesn't hold a candle to the Proms version. With the exception of the absolutely sizzling version of ""America"" for which Sondheim of course wrote the words, the performances are singularly underwhelming. Who had the not very brilliant and pointless idea of turning the duet from ""Sweeney Todd"" in to a trio with two men taking the part of Sweeney? NOT a good idea. David Hyde Pierce makes a genial host but overall the London tribute wins hands down. It is better directed, better sung, better played and better acted. For those of you who weren't privilidged to see it, I'm sorry. My American friends who have seen the London version are very much in agreement with me."
1,just awful,"From the very beginning up until I could not watch this anymore-I hated it. Bad orchestration, bad songs, bad singing ( a lot of lip synch). Maybe I just don't think much of Sondheim is very good."
5,Spectacular,"I am not a big musical person in fact I just happened to stumble upon this program on PBS and was totally blown away by the sheer talent displayed by these stars. Having been dragged kicking and screaming to a couple of local theater shows I was ruined for life at least that's what I thought until I saw what great talent is , Broadway sort of talent. All of the performances were great but Elaine Stritch stood out. What a great performer, pure Broadway. Buy Buy Buy!!!!"
5,Absolutely Breathtaking,"I was lucky enough to be there as well and I have to say... buy this without a question. Totally magical, David Hyde Pierce was a marvelous emcee, and the cast was obviously star-studded. Only Stephen Sondheim's birthday could bring these amazing performers together. Worth it just for the overwhelming finale; I don't think there was a dry eye in the audience. Just buy it."
5,"Happy Birthday, Mr. Sondheim","The taping of this birthday concert was a fantastic idea.Hosted by the witty David Hyde Pierce and starring Broadwayveterans who are grand interpreters of Sondheim's music, backed bya fabulous full orchestra led by the greatest conductor of Sondheim'sscores, Paul Gemignani, how could it be any less than wonderful?And it is! The reunions of Chip Zien and Joanna Gleaso from ""Into the Woods""Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters from ""Sunday in the Park"" and Patti LuPoneand Michael Cerveris (with an assist from George hearn) of ""Sweeny Todd""is a stroke of brilliance. The six solos from the ""red dress"" divas wereunforgettable, and the finale with over a hundred Broadway cast members singing ""Sunday""bringing Sondheim to tears, capped off a perfect evening for anyone who is a fan ofthis musical genius, celebrating his 80th birthday!!"
2,So disappointing,Love Sondheim but this disc was unsatisfactory.Regret ordering this item but I am a fan so I took a chance.
4,Sweet Mix,"A great CD for Jazzanova fans to listen and collect! Loved the first of track of Jill Scott's ""Take a little Walk"" song (not sure of the exact song title). The music of this version is jazzy & smooth. The music definitely has a lounge-y feel throughout which I like on a quiet, relaxing day!"
5,GREAT BOOK!,"If you are looking for a good book, I would highly recommend this book. It is about a girl named Karana who lived on aan island called the Island of the Blue Dolphins. She must survive alone on an island since her tribe left her and her brother there alone. I would also recommend the sequel to this book which continues the story of her, ZIA."
5,One of the best books of all time!!!,"This book was first read to me in 4th grade by Mrs. Arnold. This is probably the only book that I remember from that grade almost 30 years ago. The class couldn't wait until after lunch each day when she would read a chapter. Then, it was just a good read. Now, it is an incredible survival story. It's easy for children of all ages to relate to Karana."
1,"This so called book does not deserve to be called a ""book""","There is no reason a person should write a thing and call it a book if it is less than dirt. It may be a bit harsh but it is the truth. ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"" is not a very suitable name for a book like this, ""Island of the Freaks who live with wolves and people die"" is a much better name. I have seen the movie based on the Island of the Blue Dolphins and it tries to lively up the book but even that is a sad attempt. Scott O'Dell is a good author but this book is just not very good! I have no idea how this book ever got published and I DO NOT recommend this book!"
1,BORING,We read this book in ILA and it was so boring! The character had no emotions and it was very slow moving with no excitement. I almost fell asleep. DON'T READ THIS BOOK
1,Right up there w//Little Women as Worst Book Ever,"I was forced into reading this in class this year, which is sixth grade. Let me say right now, it is the worst book I have ever read. There is slim-to-no character development, the plot was- well, ridiculous- wait, what plot? It was basically, 'Oh, today I got food', 'Oh, today I made a weapon', 'Oh, today I bored the poor, unsuspecting sixth-grader to death!' It was an utter waste of time.Also- this girl _was_ female, and there was no mention of the fact that she was growing up. Hel-lo?"
1,HATED IT!!!!!!!!!!,I had to read it in reading class last year(5th grade)and it was probably one of the WORST and saddest books i ever read. it was WAY too sad and depressing to me.it is just sad to see someone get so lonely they capture and keep animals to be more of a friend to talk to than a pet like a normal person.i was disappointed because i thought it would be more like how karana and her people lived not how she survived with no humans for years.my mom said she didn't like the book when she read it when she was in school.this is random but ridiculousness is AWESOME!!
1,DO NOT READ!!!!!!!,"This book is boring, and dull, horrid and anything that describes terrible!!! The author of this book doesn't describe the setting well, and doesn't share the significance of the story. He also doesn't share is what propelled this story. If you attempt reading this book PLEASE put it down instantly! Save youself the discouragement! Even if someone recomends it."
1,Missing several pages,"Bought this book at the beginning of the summer for my daughter's required reading for school. Now as we are reading it, have found that it is missing an entire section, at least nine pages. Can't return it now, but have to buy another copy (paperback this time!)so my daughter can finish reading it. Not happy!Beware if you buy, make sure you are not missing pages before return window expires. Even better, DO NOT BUY!"
4,A Great Summer Book,I would recommend this book. You should read this book if you enjoy reading books in which people need to survive on their own. I loved the way that Karana would tell the story without getting distracted. I agree with how the author wrote the book in first person. It really let me understand what the character was thinking and feeling. The reason I thought it deserved four stars instead of five was due to the ending. I wanted Karana to be reunited with her family.
2,kARANA'S COURAGE,"""Island Of The Blue Dolphins"" is a pretty good book. Even though some parts in it did not interest me. It's about an Indian girl named Karana who gets stranded on an island and has to battle it out. There are exciting parts that will want you to keep on reading. It may be hard for some people to read. It also sometimes drags along and it needs a better ending. Find out what happens with Karana by reading ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS."
2,A interesting but horrible book,Island of the Blue Dolphins is a very wierd book. It makes no sence at all and is very disturbing. If you like books with gore and details-this is the book for you. I do not recamend this to any one 9-11 unless you really want to read it. This book is very sad and is in a way disgusting. Scott O'Dell did a nice job and i give him credit-but i am not a big fan of his books.
3,Island of the Blue Dolphins VHS,"First of all, it was a used VHS tape which at the purchase price of $20.00, I was not expecting! Secondly, the beginning had glitches on it which kept cutting in and out while the students and I were watching it. Third, there was no box or cover for it. I really thought I was purchasing a better product. I realize this movie is very hard to come by and I was thankful to have it, but I was disappointed."
4,Very well done,This is very complete and nice. Although it is taunting and strange. One thing is the diolouge. It seems very strange....
1,"I've seen better, Scott","I read this last year and I did not like this book at all. It was very boring. If you like Scott O'Dell's books and you like Native Americans or historical fiction, I would very strongly reccommend another book by Scott O'Dell- Sing Down the Moon, another historical fiction Native American book also by Scott O'Dell."
1,Island of theBlue Dolphins,"If you like brave, caring, strong characters you'll like this book.Also if you care for animals you'll love the way Karana takes care of them in her own special way. This book has some great description. Scott'O Dell has a very unique way of writing. Sometimes it will feel like the story thins out, but then something or someone new comes along. It also might seem like the story keeps on repeating over and over, but then something new always happens. I think you'll love the ending because some new people are added to the story."
5,Island Of The Blue Dolphins,"This book is very good. I think all kids in fifth grade should read this book.I gave this book 5,stars because it is adventurus and sad. That is why this book is great!!!"
4,Island of the blue dolphins is a very good book.,I liked this book because it has adventure in it.I liked the part when Karana was on the island alone and had to find food for herself and keep herself alive by her own risk.I would recomend this book because it is a happy book but it also has parts where the book is very sad.
4,A Beautiful Journey of Survival,"This was an amazing, beautiful story about the journey of survival about a young Indian girl on an island off the coast of California. I don't recall reading Island of the Blue Dolphins when I was in fourth grade while learning about the California Missions. This would have been a great introduction for the lessons on the California Missions and Native Americans of California. The fact it is based on a true story makes the story even more interesting and I think many fouth grade students will also enjoy the story knowing it is about a real person. I would advise many teachers to read this story with their students."
5,classic story of wilderness survival,"This classic childhood favorite and Newbery Medal Winner is as entertaining and relatable as it was when it was first published. Like many children, I read this in school when I was eight or nine, and was enthralled with the story.In the same vein as Hatchet and My Side of the Mountain, Island of the Blue Dolphins tells the story of Karana, a young woman who is left behind on her small Pacific island when the rest of her tribe leaves for California. Forced to fend for herself, she builds a home, becomes adept at fishing and gathering food, and befriends the animals living on the island with her. This is a sweet, straight-forward story of independence that is sure to attract children under the age of 12."
4,Island of the Blue Dolphins by : D10,"If you love adventure books, then Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O' Dell is for you! The main characters are Karana, Ramo, Chief Chowig, and Rontu. Karana is an Indian girl living on the Island of the Blue Dolphins with her tribe. Disaster after disaster, Karana is going through hard times. She deals with devastating losses of her loved ones and people trying to take over her island. When her tribe leaves on a boat without her, Karana is forced to live on the island alone. She faces many dangers, and almost loses her life. Will she survive? I loved this novel because it's exciting and interesting. I liked that the story was told through Karana's eyes. In this book I saw many themes, and they were survival, love, friendship, and nature. Island of the Blue Dolphins is historical fiction and great for kids 8-12 years old. Once you've started, you can't put it down. I highly recommend this book to adventure lovers."
4,Time Well Spent,"I read this to my children, ages 5-9. They hung on (nearly) every word. And, as an adult, I enjoyed it too. Great drama, without being sentimental. You won't be disappointed."
4,my review on the island of blue dolphins,"I think this was a wonderful book. Some parts were sad and some parts were happy and joyful. This was a great story with amazing twists around each bend. Karana was very adventurous and almost always had smart ideas. It amazes me how she held on and faced even the dreadfulest things. One thing I did not like about this book is that there was too many details and facts that I thought did not need to be in the story.Other than that , this book was interesting and I would recomend it for 3rd grade -adults."
4,From a college students perspective,"I remember reading Scott O'Dell's' novel as a student in elementary school. However, it wasn't until I was required to read it again in college that I realized its true educational value. This novel focuses on Karana's (a young member of the Chumash tribe on the San Nicholas Island) survival and self-discovery. This book provides its readers with a true image of the Chumash lifestyle and culture. With descriptions of the island, the village, the weapons, and the artworks of the Chumash, the reader can easily imagine personally being on the Island with Karana. The book also teaches the students about nature and how to appreciate the environment surrounding them. As Karanas personality and beliefs develop, the reading can see her reasoning and have an appreciation for her actions and values."
5,A must for our children to read!,"Parents, if you haven't purchased this book for your child yet, please do so. This is a great, timeless classic to pass on to the next generation. Expand their horizons with a true adventure story while introducing them to another culture. Fantastic!Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
4,Why I liked the book,I liked the story and I also liked that it was based on a true story. I found many parts sad. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because some parts dragged on with descriptions but only a few.
4,My review on Island of the Blue Dolphins,"My least favorite scene in this book was when Karana jumped off the ship to go find her brother, I did not like this scene because I tought that Karana would drown. My favorite scene in this book was when Karana saved Rontu, a dog that she had speared but she would take to him home and he would become her friend. I hope you all the kids that read this eview read the book ecause it is a truley great book..."
4,Her Dog,"this book was outstanding there was a part with a giant sqiud and she killed it WOW!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!? then there was the part were her brother died because of a dog, it was interresting , dangerous, survival, and she did not have good luck everyone that she loved or cared for died. It was funny and had a lot of violece and suvival skills i gave it a four star rating because it was good and ive read better."
4,It is a Great Book!! You Need to Read It!,"The book, Island of the Blue Dolphins, is a GREAT book. Although in some parts it is boring. I liked the part when Karana made hide-outs for when the Aluets came. The part I disliked was when Rontu, her dog, died. The book is about a girl, named Karana, who lived alone on the island. Read the book to find out how she got to be alone. Karana is a brave young girl. She was a strong person."
4,A Slow But Great Book!,"Island of the Blue Dolphins was very,very intersting but slow. I would recommend this book to everyone who loves to read.This storie about Karana a girl who is left behind on a lonely island. She has to survive from wild animals hearting her, catch her own food, and make her own weapons. She survives by having wild dogs to protect her and make her own protection. If you read it you would like it. If you like fast paced books you would still like this book. Karana is always in a exciting new adventure.My opinion is 4 stars. Shes a very courageos girl who wants to stay alive. Plus the story really happend."
4,It is Wonderful! READ IT!!!,"The book, Island of the Blue Dolphins, was a great book about a girl named Karana who lived on an island alone. To find out how she got there, read this terific book. A part of the book that shows a lot of courage is when Karana tries rowing across the ocean in a row boat I dont want to ruin the book so you'll have to read the book to find out what happens. This book has lots of adventure and a lot of nature. Read this book and enjoy every chapter and page. I sure did!!!"
4,Island of the Blue Dolphins,"Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O' Dell was the best book that I have ever read. I just couldn't put it down. It was filled with drama. I do not recommend this book for anyone under the age of 8. They might not understand the story. A teenage girl, Karana, living with her Native American tribe on an island off the coast of California experiences some big changes. This happens when some Russians come to the island and offer to take the tribe to the mainland. Karana's brother is left behind so she jumps off the ship and swims to shore. They live together happily until her brother is eaten by a pack of wild dogs. Karana must now defend herself. She chooses to go to the mainland when the Russians come back to pick her up. She lives the rest of her life on the sandy beaches of California."
3,6th Grader,Not good at all. Sooooooooo boring and weird language. I only continued because i had 1 weekend to finish my book report and the library was closed. I do not think it deserved a Newberry Medal. No offense Scott O'Dell!
4,Great Author,"My daughter read for book club. She loved the book, I remember it from when I was a child also. Parts can be hard - emotional, depending on the child. But well worth it."
4,good,THIS BOOK WAS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. She liked it very much. I am looking for some other books for 7th graders do you have any suggestions?
5,Interesting True Tale,"I would recommend this book to everyone of all ages. It is a true story and it is fascinating what she had to do to survive. Easy reading. Used to be assigned reading to children in our area, Central Coast of California, don't know if it is still."
5,Also very good for an English learner,"As a non-native English learner, I love this book very much. Story is funny, but some words are little bit rare for me. Sentences are much more beautiful and smooth than another book named ""Chronicles of Narnia"""
2,Blue dolphins,Warning spoilers! This book is just not that great. It is at some parts that are good but the rest is just not. Like in the beginning the main character's dad dies in a really dramatic way. But you can tell that there trying to make it so dramatic but it was like in the third or fourth chapter. But they barely had any character development with him so you don't really care. But then after the main girl gets stranded on an island it starts to get good. But then at a point it just droped. Then really all that happens was she was just getting food so she can survive and befriending animals. Some of it is interesting but some of it is not. There is this really generic time line. Like really it would be like another spring went by. No I am not kidding that is how it was. An entire season would go by in a sentience. So ya I highly don't recommend this book.
5,Awsome,I just have to keep reading. I love your characters .I love the description of every thing plus the names
3,MY Review..,"This book is about an Indian girl named Karana. She lived on the Island of the Blue Dolphins alone because her fellow Indians left her behind and sailed East. It tells me the things she lived off of with only resources she could find and make essential things for living. It tells about the hardships she gone through. Then, in the end, she gets rescued by a ship.I thought this book was a good book for a younger audience. I like unrealistic andventure books compared to realist ones. What I liked about this book though, was that when you pick it up and start reading, you won't want to stop. Overall, I liked the book but I'd rather get a book with more challenge for me."
5,"the review of ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"" by Victor","Island of the Blue Dolphins is a great book. It's about a girl named Karana who gets left behind on the Island of the Blue Dolphins with her brother, Ramo, when the villagers leave to go to a new island. She tries to make weapons and survive from all the other wild animals. Karana gets a lot of animal friends, too! I liked this book because of the characters, the action, and the fun. It's one of my favorite books because it's full of thrill and adventure! I liked it very much and I think it would be good for all people to enjoy!"
4,A sad but exciting story about an Indian girl named Karana.,This story is about a tribe who lives on the Island of Blue Dolphins. The Aleuts come to the island for otter skin promising the tribe half of the skin. The Aleuts left with the skins after they killed most of the warriors and the chief.The new chief went to find a new island. A ship with white men on them came to take them to the new island. Karana's brother Ramo was left behind and she jumped off the ship to get her brother. They are on the island alone. A few days later Ramo is killed by a pack of wild dogs.Karana is forced to make a home and find food to stay alive. Will the Aleuts come back or the ship? Will the dogs that killed her brother come after her? Read this interesting book The Island of the Blue Dolphins.
3,Different From The Book,"I read this book in 5th grade and it was really good. My class and I were really excited about the movie. When we watched it we would say ""Hey they forgot about this part!"" I say you either watch the movie or read the book since they are different and the movie laeves out a lot of the story. I have to say thoough it was beautifuly acted though."
3,Island of the Blue Dolphins review for Mrs. Powell,"Hi, I am doing my review on Island of the Blue Dolphins. This book is about an indian girl named Karana and her tribe that goes away, and her brother, Ramo gets left behind. My favorite part was the ending. My favorite part was learning that this was about a true story. My least favorite part was when her brother dies. I also learned that she was on the island for 18 years by herself. My favorite character was Rontu-Alu. I would reccommend this book to someone who likes true stories that are sad with happy endings. This book is about bravery, confindence and survival."
3,ITS OK,"Well after I finished reading it, it turned out ok but I didn't really like the ending. All that build up and it doesn't really stop anywhere it was a huge let down. Even though the build up is kind of good there's a LOT of death which really annoyed me but I really enjoyed the devil fish. I think its ether a giant squid or an octopus but anyways it's cool.Im a little glad they did kill of everyone early so we didn't get to attached to them and be devastated when he/she died. I did think the author was very descriptive through. He would say things like ""some of the teeth were as long as my hand and half its width. They were curved at the tops and some were broken, but when I had ground the best of them and put them down with the sand, I had work four good spears points, broad at the bottom and very sharp at the ends.""So I would give this book 3 out of 5."
3,Island of the Blue Dolphin was just okay.,"I know I may be in the minority, but I thought this book was just okay. I enjoyed the young heroine's bravery and loyalty to her brother and her ingenuity in solving problems. I guess my biggest problem with the story was some of her behaviors were not believable or age appropriate. I had a big problem with her taming the wild dog, this was just not believable in my mind. And I am not so sure that telling young people that it is possible is very prudent."
3,Island of the Blue Dolphins,"Can you imagine being stuck on an island by yourself with no protection? Well believe it or not Karana did. Karana is the main character of the story. She is a Native American left behind due to her family values. She wasn't capable of living on her own until she tried. It all started when the Aleuts came to their fish shaped island for otter. They killed many and forced Karana's tribe to flee the island. When Karana figured out that her brother was left behind she had to go back. This story tells how she survived on her own for a few years. People from grades 4-6 would probably enjoy this book.Scott O'Dell's book, Island of the Blue Dolphins, won the Newbery Medal for its poetic feeling. This book was very lively and very interesting throughout. We would recommend this book to people who enjoys survival stories and descriptive language."
4,island of the blue dolphins,"Island of the Blue Dophins is about a girl who lives in a village with her father,brother,and other villagers.One day the Aleuts came to catch seal,but they don't share with the villagers.Some time later after the Aluets leave men come and take the villagers to a better place.Karana and her brother get left behind.Soon her brother gets killed by the wild dogs. Now she's all alone and she has to make shelter,weapons,and gather food.I like this book because when I read it it makes me feal like I'm in her place.I think children 10 and up will underststand and like this book."
4,I reccomend this Book !!!!!!!!,Hey all of those peeps out there!!This is a great book if you like adventure and if u are interested about how native americans survied it is also sad!I would reccomend this book any day!!
3,The Great Survivor,"This book is an adventure story and you never know what is going to happen next!It swallows you into the book and you read page by page until you are finished with the whole book!I think this book was very good and intresting.It shows you how strong people are when they are in need.Karana is living on a island with her tribe until one day salutes drive her tribe of the beatiful island.They were scared of them and what they might do to them. All of her tribe left exept for Karana and her brother,they get stranded for many days and years.I cannot tell you why and what became of them.You have to read this incredibale book!"
5,The Best book I ever read !,"Alart,alart here comes the best book I ever read it is cauld The Island of the Blue Dolphins. I think all of you have read it and if you havent I expect you read it.I recogmend this book to teachers and parents every were.If you arenot going to read this book tell people about it!"
4,What about the dolphins???,"This book has a very different appeal to it than what the title says. When I first picked out this book I thought it would be very much about dolphins. Well, I was wrong. I guess the saying goes--don't judge a book by its cover! Other than that I quite enjoyed this book. You could call it a very ""adventurous"" novel. In school right now we are studying dogs--such as wild dogs. So it helped me understand this book more. One part in the novel that I most enjoyed was how the author described her house that she was making all by herself. I could almost exactly see what the house looked like that Karana was making. At the end of the book, I think that Karana should of stayed on the island. But who knows? DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!!!!!"
5,A great book for readers of all ages!,"When I first looked at the cover I thought it was going to be boring, but after our class started to read I actually began to enjoy it! Even though historical-fiction isn't my favorite type of book this is one of my favorite books. Some of the parts are really realistic!"
5,Island of the Blue Dolphins,I first read Island of the Blue Dolphins as a young girl. I remember it as one of my favorites and after 25+ years I still consider this children's book to be one of the best books I have ever read. Add this book to your holiday list for any juvenile readers. I guarantee they'll love it!
5,I really like this book and I don't mind reading it again!,"This book is my favorite book. I even liked the movie. I don't mind reading it again because I like it! The book was about a eighteen year old girl named Karana. even My best part of the book was when she made a home for herself, even a bird cage for the bird who had a broken wing. She had a dog but I forgot the dogs name. This book is the coolest book i've ever read in my whole life, but I have some other books I like too!"
3,I liked this book.,I liked this book because it teaches you about the life of the Indians. The book also teaches you about survival. I liked it also because it was interesting. It was interesting because you never knew when something was going to happen next.
5,I thought this book was very good.,I really like the book Island of the Blue Dolphins. It is one of my favorite books. I like the way the author describes the island and the characters. You have to be very brave to live on an island by yourself for twelve years. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.tt
2,Pretty Darn Dull!,"My daughter had to read this book this year in the 4th grade. She was so bored by it, that I had to read it aloud to her so that she could pass the weekly chapter quizes. About the only interesting or exciting events were Karana's experiences with the wild dogs. Her trip away from the island in the canoe went on for about 10 pages, and all it was about was the canoe leaking. If these are the types of books that are supposed to motivate kids to become interested in reading, I'm afraid we are going to alot of non-reading adults. UGH!"
2,What I feel about Island of the Blue Dolphins,"It was my homework to read this book. The story about an Indian girl who lives alone in island all about eighteen years. She learned how to survive with no help. It souds intersting. Right? However, there is no specific factors. It is just the same as the other adventure books. What such a boring story. If auther written more exiting not just descripte,it might be better. Sometimes, I imagine that live alone ,but this way."
4,Pretty good but a little old fashioned and slow,I am an Elementary education major and had to view the video and compare it to the book for a lesson plan. I thought it accurately depicted a lot of things but was incorrect in a lot of other ways. It did bring the characters to life but left out some key scenes. Rontu in the movie was not one of the wild dogs from the island but was left by the Aleuts whereas in the book he was described as one of the wild dogs. Other than that I found it a bit slow and old fashioned. Overall I thought it was good and would use it with a class to view critically and to compare to the book.
2,Something to think about.,"My daughter is 9 and received this book for Christmas. Everyone was telling us it was a great book but couldn't remember details. I decided to read it before my daughter. I am glad I did. The book starts off with the mother already having died. The father is killed along with most of her tribe. To top it all off the little brother is also killed. The girl also kills several animals, all without much feeling if any. They give a reading age of (9-12). It is considered a young adult read. My daughter is not an adult of any kind. She is a child. The content of the book is a bit much for a child who loves family and animals. My daughter is an advanced reader but I would not want her reading this book until she was much older. As far as I'm concerned it was an okay read, but for now it will stay on the shelf."
2,Disappointed,The book is a good story but not what I wanted. I was looking for a story about dolphins.
2,boring as hell,"i was forced to read this in school and i could not stand it... i got about halfway in before i was forced, out of bordom, to skim the rest of the book... save you time and effort and do not read this book."
2,"When I read ""Island of the Blue Dolphins""","I recently read ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"". It was for school and I had to answer 35 questions about it. I think it would be a better movie than a book. Here's why. The whole story was about Karana surviving on her own, on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. It was a great choice for the teachers to pick, while I found it sort of boring and/or repetitive. Every couple pages or so, it told about a different day on the same island with the same person, not including the animals. I also found that a lot of people were killed or died in the story, which I found being inappropriate for children in my age group. I am 11 and I do not think this would be a good choice for kids under 12. Thanks."
2,An OK read,"I decided to read this book after having it for years on my shelf and was curious to know what it was about. It's basically about a girl building shelter, making clothes, and befriending all the island's creatures while waiting YEARS for a ship to show up. There really is no plot or rising/falling action. I was even hoping for a little romance to pop up when the Aleuts come back , but she befriends a girl instead. I really haven't gained anything from reading this (except maybe how to spear live animals). It could be because I am 17 years old but never-the-less, if your a young reader go ahead and read it, you have nothing to lose."
1,A Typical Survival Story: Repetitious and Boring,"I'm sorry, but this seems to be just another survival story...and I don't particularly like survival stories. The main character in this story has so little emotion it is hard to view her as a real character, and making her a native american umpteen decades ago doesn't add anything to the story. Plus, each chapter seems to be nothing but a different survival encounter for her...Today, I killed a sea urchin...Today, I scared off some wild animals...Today, I yadda yadda yadda. Now, you may think I'm being critical of this just because I hate all survival stories...that is not so. I have read some good survival stories before, such as Hatchet. They do exist...just not here."
1,Dont waste your money!!,"This book is to hard and confusing. This book is at a very high level and I dont reccomend thi s to people, unless they want to waste their time on a book they wont understand. DONT WASSTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
1,Love the book. Don't waste you your time with this video.,"I do believe Scott O'Dell would be appalled by this movie. So many important events from the book are missing in this version. I can understand that not all events could included, but Karana's character is not the the strong, resourceful, independent girl of the book. Please, do yourself a favor and just reread the book. Don't lose any brain cells watching this vapid version of one of the best children's books I ever read!"
1,WHAT'S THE WHOLE POINT?...,I WISH I COULD RATE THIS ZERO STARS! 0 ZIP ZILCH ZIPPO! WHAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT? WE ARE READING THIS IN MY CLASS AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMTIN' BRO: I READ THE FIRST PAGE....I DID NOT LIKE IT. SECOND PAGE...BORING... THIRD PAGE...ZZZ... LAST PAGE...I GOT VERY VERY CONFUSED. I DID NOT GET IT A BIT!!!...A very emotinal review composed by the Lakers and the Sixers...
1,I can't believe anyone would ever waste their time.,"My absolute least favorite book in the world. ... I would award it zero stars if it was possible. ... I kept turning and turning pages, waiting for a plot to show up. ... The only reason she jumps off the boat is for her brother, who dies like a week later. The rest of the novel is intricate descriptions of complicated wolf traps and how she hollows out a boat. ... I loathe survival stories, and this one was utterly pointless. ..."
4,Daniel,I thought this book was very well written. It was a great book and quite enjoyable to read. I would advise anyone to read this great book.
3,Island of the blue dolphins,"Island of the blue dolphins is a good book,and it had a couple of lessons in it.The beginning is kind of boring,but informative.As you read on in the book it gets better.It is about a girl and her indian tribe, and one day a boat comes and takes her tribe away but her brother gets left behind and she swimms back to the island and survives along with her brother!"
4,A Journey,"I had to read the Island of the Blue Dolphin for a book report in sixth grade. At first, I thought it was boring because I am not into adventures. But, when I read deeper into the context I realize it wasn't an adventure it was a matter of life or death for Karana. Scott O'Dell has his own style and he painted a great picture of what the story was about in my head. That is why I would rate it a 4. I wouldn't rate it a 5 because of the ending it seems to me the author had a variety of run-ons about her fight that was not needed and he kind of rushed the end."
4,6th Grade,Hi I'm Agnes and I read the book Island of the Blue Dolphins in 6 th grade! I loved the book. We also saw the movie that went with the book! The book was very intersting and I hope that there will be another part to it! It is very amagizing how such a young girl learns to survive with so little! I'm a freshman at Kennedy High School and hope to be a teacher one day and I truely will recommend it to my students and kids of my own when I have 'em ;)! ~Agnes~
4,island of the blue dolphins is a great book,I think it was a good book i saw the movie to but it was black and white and very cheesy and Ramo died to easy and early i mean hes a kid he has like no meat on him those dogs are realy stuppid but not Rontu hes my favorite and i feel bad for Karana that all her people died and she was thge last one but if you read the book it is actualy is good but you have to like history so i recomend reading it it gets booring in the begining but later it gets better just like artemis fowl it is boring in the beggining.
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!,"My mom and I read this book together and I loved it. This story was very exciting and gave lots of great details. I think the plot was very cool. There were also great characters like dogs,birds, seals and more.If you ever see this book in the store BUY IT! I recomend this book to EVERYONE!!!"
4,Gary Ward TED451,Wonderful discriptive writing. I love how Karana survives off everything she has learned during childhood. The danger factor of the wild dogs made the book exciting. Over all it is a good book.
5,Ashley Carey's review of The Island of the Blue Dophins,This book is a story of a girl and her family.They live on a island. One day they were attacked and her people had to leave their homeland. This girl named Karai and her brother were left on the island all alone to survive. Island of the Blue Dolphins inspired me to be greatful for what I already have.
5,My thoughts on Island of the Blue Dolphins,"I thought this book was excellent! Mr. O'dell did a really good job of describing the island, her situtations, and the things and ways she used natural recourses and tools. I felt like I was watching her and listing to the exciting things she did. The book was sad and her real life story was really sad also. The way she used the natural resources was incredible. I would recommend this book to a person who enjoys emotional and interesting books."
5,Wonderful for Young Readers,"This book touched me as a young girl. I think I read it about ten times growing up. It is a wonderful story about courage, survival, isolation, and trust. It is an amazing adventure and I recommend it for all children. The book is deserving of awards but I would have loved it even if it had been an obscure story that never won awards - there are a lot of good stories out there that are like that. I am going to buy an extra copy of this for a little niece, so she will have it to read in a few years. I think this type of book has the power to mold and shape lives, who we are and who we will become.These are some other good books for young readers:From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. FrankweilerThe Time Entity Trilogy (Heaven's Jewel, The Eternity Stone, Futures Sown)Five on a Treasure Island (Famous Five)Tuck Everlasting"
4,A Fun Way to Finish Your IBD Unit!,"I love showing this video once we finish reading the book, Island of the Blue Dolphins. My 4th graders are definitely amused with this older movie; the acting and technology are definitely not what they're used to. Nonetheless, it's a treat for them to watch, and then we create a Venn diagram comparing/contrasting the movie and the book. A must buy for any 4th grade teacher in California! :)"
5,A true Classic,"I first read this book when I was myself a kid, and it was easily one of my favorites. It had all of the important elements to keep a young reader engaged, and made a definite impression on me. Thirty or so years later, and my daughter is now reading this book for the first time. She isn't as voracious a reader as I was, but this is the one title she's started reading that she cannot put down. A true classic."
4,good sad stroy for 10 year olds,"My ten year old was assigned this book as part of her summer reading requirements entering the 5th grade. I find that the story is very sad and I would prefer more uplifting literature for a child her age. However, She liked the story and I found that it was well written so I have to recommend it. I do not think it is the kind of book that is fun or makes a child fall in love with reading but it is interesting enough to make it worth the read."
5,Present for my grandson,I got this for a christmas present for my 8 yr. old grandson. He says he is enjoying it very much.
3,Nice book,This book was alright but could have had more action. I struggled to stay interested in this book but it was still a good book.
5,Karana and Rontu,"I really liked the book Island of the Blue Dolphins because of how Karana survived all by herself for 18 years. My favorite part in the book was how she finds a wild dog, almost kills it, but then feels sad and saves his life. He becomes really nice and lives with Karana. You should read the book because it is just so intriguing! I will give this book 5 stars because it was just so amazing!"
4,island of the blue dolphins,"If you like shocking,interesting,and heart breaking books you should probably want to read ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"".It is by Scott O'Dell.Its about a girl who is left and stranded in an island.SHE NEEDS TO SURVIVE!Karana has difficult times like when she has to find a way to hunt.She thinks,and finally makes a spear.She learns how to catch fish.Its pretty sad when you think of orphans now a days.I really recommend kids to read it.I read it in the 4th grade.I loved it so much I read it again,and now im writing about it.YOU SHOULD READ IT![...]"
5,I loved this as a young teenager...,"Around the age of 12 - 13, this was one of my favorite books. When buying it now as a grown up, I was fascinated to discover this book was actually based on a true story.A young girl, Karana, is living with her tribe on the Island of the Blue Dolphins (the island is apparently based off the coast of California). After increasing contact with white men (some with tragic results), the tribe is evacuated from the island. At the last moment, Karana jumps off the boat since she discovers her younger brother is left behind. The brother is killed very soon afterwards, and Karana is left to take care of herself - not only to provide herself with food & shelter, but also to fend off a pack of ild dogs wich roams the island, with the threat of unfriendly white men constantly hanging in the background."
4,Karana's Island,"I enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was a great story that clearly showed the strength, courage, and survival of it's main character Karana. After reading this book I learned a great deal about the people of San Nicolas Island and their way of life. This book was sad at times, but also inspiring. I would recommend this book to elementary school children and teachers (grades 4-6)."
4,The Island,"This book is good for all ages, though at times it's bit violent. Anyway, this book is about a girl named Karana who is from a village called Ghalas-at on The Island of the Blue Dolphins in the Paficic Ocean. Her adventure begins when a group of violent men come the island to hunt sea otter for their pelts.They are led by a Russian man who proves to be dishonest: Captain Orlov.The Aluets eventually turn on the village and the two engage in war. In the end, the Aluets prevail and many men are killed; including Karana's father; Chief Chowig. Years later, a boat comes to the island. Confirming that it not an ALuet ship the villagers board the ship. Karana boards the ship aswell but cannot find her younger brother, Ramo. Karana makes a life changing desicion and jumps of the boat to find Ramo on the island. This action changes the story's events.HOpe you injoy it."
3,Island of the Blue Dolphins,"I remember reading this book as a child and wanted to add it to my home library.I received the book in about a week however, the Amazon website was a little confusing and they sent me an additional copy of the book. It was a slight hassle returning it and I had to pay for the return shipping charges."
1,IOBD STINKS!,"This book is a teachers' pet, meaning every teacher makes kids read it. The book has good material, but there is no storyline, it's just random events that don't lead up to anything. Karana shows no emotion even tough everything around her dies or leaves her.SPOILER ALERT!!!:::Ending is horrible because Karana leaves the island, which is just dumb.Stay away from this book."
1,Last Time I trust the School District Recommendation!,"I selected this book for my daughter's summer reading based on a school district list of recommended reading. She complained bitterly about it from the start. I assumed it was just because she hadn't given it a chance, so insisted she keep reading it. She is now about 40 pages from the end and just as miserable. I went looking for reviews to see what others were getting from the book and I am just appalled at how poorly received it is!!I will never just trust a school district recommendation again without seeking out reviews or reading it myself!My daughter and I are getting some comic relief from reading the kid reviews....""this book doesn't deserve to be called a book"" and ""it's drivel"" are our favorite comments. And that's from the kids!"
3,Not Quite Perfect,"I read Island of the Blue Dolphins for a required reading book. The book is really good and exciting most of the time, but the end is really bad. It literally ends right in the middle of the book. Nothing is explained and it really doesn't make sense. That is why I give this book 3 stars."
5,Island of theblue dolphins review,"i liked this book it taught me about indian life, about if there was an emergency and i was alone on an island how to survive. After each chapter i wanted to read more. I discovered how to say boy,girl,and good bye. This is my favorite non sport book"
2,"you can get dvd for 20 bucks, new, other places","I wanted a dvd of this to show my class, and was sad to see the price so high here. I googled it once and found it through other places for 20 bucks."
3,Confusing,"I thought that this book was sort of confusing. Most of the time i didn't know what the book was talking about. All i knew was that a girl named, Kerona, and what is a sea elephant. So i gave it 3 stars. I still am stumped over that book. It was long, boring, and confusing. I don't know how kids can understand it."
3,Bored enough!,"Scott O'Dell's book ""Island of the Blue Dolphins was needed for me (I am in 4th going to 5th grade)to read and do a book report on it. Actually, my book report is much more interesting than the book. The book is like on of those historical books where there aren't that much conversations so writing this book must be very,very hard!Sorry Scott."
2,not my type!,My teacher assigned this book to read in the 6th grade! I really did try to get in to the book but I just couldn't make myself like it it's about a girl indian surviving in a small island for 18 years which was hard to believe i htink I'll stick with the horror books!
2,Frankly boring!!!,It was very boring!!! Nothing very interesting happened in this book. I do not recommend it.
5,Blue Dolphin book review by scott o dell,"This was a book from my childhood, my 2nd grade teacher read me this book over 40 years ago. I remember it today as if it was only yesterday, I ordered this book in took me back to my childhood, it was as interesting today as a man of 53 years of age as it was to that 2nd grader many years ago. It is a great book for not only children but for a parent also, a great read for parents or grandparents to a child."
5,Fantastic! Magnificant! I recommend this book to ANY reader!,"I read this book when I was ten (I am twelve now) and I loved it. I couldn't put it down for a second. This book explained how Indians kept their houses, or did their work. You felt you were actually IN the book yourself. There was Adventure, excitement, sadness, and happiness. This is one of my favorite books along with ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" and ""The Bronze Bow"" by Elizabeth George Speare. Have fun!"
3,"A odd , but true story of a girl in her early teens.","She was forgotten about. But this story tells the complete and propelling story of the the girl from the islan of the Blue Dophins, to when she gets to Santa Barbara."
3,Good. But not great.,"Though overall, it was generally a good book, I didn't reallylike it. I just don't know why. It could be because I never reallygot to know the character, what she was like, or it could be because I am not the type to read this kind of book. You should read it. See for yourself. I may not like it, but I wouldn't be surprised if you did."
4,Island of the Blue Dolphins,I think the book is so special because it has a very interesting plot.I like the part when Karana was rescued by the people who were stuck on the island before her.I felt sad when Ramo died and I hope the author did not include that part in the book.I hope that I never get stranded on the island by myself like Karana.Mayvin.
4,Island of the Blue Dolphins,I think the book is a very special book because it has a very interesting plot.I like in the book how Karana was saved by the people who came back to rescue her from the island.I do not like it so much when Romo died because it made me so sad reading about it.I hope I never get stranded on the island like Karana and the dog.Mayvin.
5,Still a great book on rereading 47 years later!,"Nancy in Seattle, WA : First read this story in the 4th or 5th grade and was utterly captivated by the descriptions of what this young woman must have gone through in order to survive. Over the years, the title and story stayed with me. When I saw it again for the Kindle, knew that I would have to renew my acquaintance with the book. It is just as engrossing after all this time. I have to thank all of the teachers who work to instill a love of reading in their students by finding tales such as this one. Boys and girls alike can find a new world in these pages."
5,Dolphin book for school,"We received this book very quickly, in the described condition. It was an earlier print of the book with a smaller font, but overall it was a greatbuying experience."
2,O.K Book,The book was about a girl name Karana. She was stranded on the Island of the Blue Dolphins for a number of years.The book was good because she did not have any body to talk tobut her animals.
3,okay,"I must admit that this book is quite dull in my point of view. The story is very interesting but the way Scott O'dell wrote it really did disappoint me. I wouldn't recommend you to buy it, but it is a good read."
4,as the ship leaves,Imagine you and your family living on an island for millions of generations before and one day hunters come and kill half of your tribe. In this your father is gone and the newest tribal leader will be leaving soon. Now you are left with around nine men and your tribe is scarce with food. Now you think you have lost another member because soon after your new leader ventured to find a new home for you he does not come back for many suns and moons. Many years later a ship is spotted and before you new it where on your way to America but your little brother decided to go back and get his fishing sphere. Most of you would not go back to get him but something sparked this young girls mind as she dove back into the water to stay with her brother. Very soon she found her brother dead attacked by wild dogs so your braveness was completely pointless.
2,OK book,I'm 11 years old and this this book ain't that great. Its boring ang confusing at some parts. It just isn't that good to a sith grader.
2,boring,"Karana, the little girl in the story, was living on an island. The story is all about the girl arriving on the island of the blue dolphins, which she ends up living there for eighteen years. I didn't like it because it didn't have enough action in it. I think a girl would like it."
2,"The book stunk, i hated it, don't get it...","I'm Paul Maxey, 12 year old from Mt. Airy MD. I was forced into reading this horrible book in my L.A. class at the beggining of the school year. It was very hard to understand, and when you have to take a test on something you didn't really want to read...well, you get the point... So whatever you do, don't get it! PLEASE!Paul Maxey (troubled 12 year old)"
2,Scott O'Dell's book is Okay,"The story of the Island of the Blue Dlophins is about an Indian girl named Karana who must fend for herself on the Island of Ghalas-at. She has to get her own food, fight off her enemies, and make efforts to try and find a ship that will get her off this island. Throughout the story she begins to befriend various animals. As I was reading the book, I was feeling sorry for Karana, but the story did not make a huge impact on me. It is pretty much a story for a younger audience."
3,"Long,Boring,but somewhat good.","Island of the Blue Dolphins is a pretty long,pretty boring book...With some good points.It has a good storyline for intense.It's basicly about a girl that gets left behind on an island.She gets a pet wolf...Blah Blah ...Gets Rescued ...More Blah.So if youreally want to sit down and read a semi-good book,I suggest this one."
2,This book is pointless,Nothing happened in this book that was interesting. It was stupid because nothing really exiting happened. Don't read this book!
3,I thought this was a great book.,This was a very interesting book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read.
4,A review,"I thought the book wasn't wonderful but wasn't bad either. Karana is left behind with her brother Ramo on an island when her fellow Indians leave on a ship to Santa Barbara, California, which is straight from Karana's island... I have to say that is was very good."
3,good characters boring plot.,"I didn't rate this book very well because it started out good, but when I got to the middle of the book it started to get boring. It started on the Island of the Blue Dolphins, with a girl named Won-a-pa-lei waiting for a ship with red sails to come to the island. Soon it came and the weather was very nice. The problem is that Won-a-pa-lei and her brother Ramo got left behind on the island, and they had to take care of themselves. After a little while Ramo got attacked and killed by wild dogs, so Won-a-pa-lei was on the island by herself, and she had to do all the work that was done by a man. That is when it started getting boring when she had to start taking care of herself."
5,This is one of the best books that I have ever read.,"I'm 11 years old and I read ""Island Of The Blue Dolphins"" when I was 10. I think one of the reasons why I loved this book so much is that it was so discriptive. The author, Scott O'Dell told all the incidents in great detail. I also loved it because it was so realistic. It was like I was Karana and all the things that were really happening to her, were happening to me instead!I loved this book very much!"
4,I.B.D;an OK Book,"This story is basicly about Karana, a 12 year old indian girl that lives with her tribe on an island called Island of the Blue Dolphins. A ship comes, sent by the tribes 2nd chief,Kimki (the 1st chief died in a war), to take then to a diff. country. Karana jumps off the boat to save her brother, who was left. He soon dies, and Karna is left on the island alone. She makesfriends with the animals, inculding 2 of her pets, Rontu and Rontu-Aru.She faces ALOT of dangers, and after 18 years, she gets saved!! A good survivel story."
3,Good Adveture book,"The Island of the Blue Dolphins is about a girl who gets stranded on an island by herself and only has animals to keep her company. She makes lots of pets. She goes through troubles such as wild dogs, sea elephants (walruses), and an earthquake. Eventually, some friendly men come and take her home with all of her belongings.I think this book ""The Island of the Blue Dolphins"" is a 3 out of 5 star book because it has alot of action but it skips from time to time. For example it will say somethong like ""two summers later"" or ""next fall I ...."" I recomend this book if you enjoy emotional or adventure books."
4,Fearless female heroine,"I never realized this is based on a true story, and quite an amazing one at that. It's great to read about such a strong female role model. She survives despite terrible odds, figuring out how to find and store food, tame animals, and brave the elements. This is a classic. I missed this as a young reader, and even a teacher, so I was glad when offered the opportunity to read it now. Hopefully, kids will continue to read it for many years to come."
2,Depressing,"I had to read this for my online class and I found it an utterly depressing read. Although, I didn't like it personally...it was a well written."
2,Island of the blue dolphin,"This book was good,but it was really slow in some parts. I wish the author would have made the story a little faster at some points."
5,Island of the Blue Dolphins - A Story of Courage,"Island of the Blue Dolphins is a historical fiction that takes place on island of the southwest coast of California in the year 1853. The main character, Karana, is a native of the village of ""Ghalas-At"" and has been stranded on an island after attempting to save her younger brother, Ramo. After the two are left to survive on their skills and wits, Karana finds her brother attacked by wild dogs and killed. At 12 years old, Karana is truly alone and manages to find food, build a shelter and protect herself against Aleut hunters, wild dogs and nature's worst weather. The story is told from the point of view of Karana and is filled with figurative language that is simple and profound. It is a story of courage, survival and endurance and demonstrates how it is in the very essence of human nature to forgive one's enemies and strive for happiness."
4,Island of the Blue Dolphins,"A very enjoyable book. I read this book while in elementary school, and recently re-read it because I remembered how much I enjoyed it as a child. An easy read with its roots based on a true part of history."
3,deck the halls with this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"""iSLAND oF tHE bLUE dOLPHINS"" IS A GREAT BOOK.tAKE IT FROM ME.I LIKED ANDSO WILL YOU.IT'S THE ""INSANE SENSATION THATS SWEEPING THE NATION""!!!!IT'S ABOUT A GIRL NAMED kARANA WHO JUMPS OFF A SHIP TO SAVE HER BROTHER,RAMO.WHO EVENTUALLY DIES.THEN ,KARANA IS TRAPPED ON AN ISLAND FOR 18 YEARS.FINALLY,SHE GETS OFF THE ISLAND."
5,Island of the Blue Dolphins:a reveiw,"Island Of The Blue Dolphins(IBD) takes place on an island in the Pacific Ocean. Hunters came and caused a big problem.The islanders leave the island and leave 2 people behind.One vows to avenge a death on the wild dogs.She maks friends with a dog. She kills a devilfish, but never gets to eat it. She vows never to kill another animal again. She makes pets of plenty more animals.The hunters come again. She makes friends among one of thier women.

4,Island Of the Blue Dolphins,"This is a wonderful book for children of all ages. It is about a young island girl that is left alone on the Island of Blue Dolphins, with her brother Ramo. Ramo is killed within 10 days of their survival. Karana, the young indian girl is rescued within 6 or 7 years by white men, as she calls them, who have came before but, she hid from them because she did not know who they were or waht they wanted. She was afraid of them then she decided to go and meet them the next time they came. The End*~*~"
3,A fairly well book to read,"This book was ok, that is why i rated it 3 stars.In some parts with Karana it keeps you ""on your toes,"" but in other parts it can get a little boring.It is about a girl named Karana, that struggles to stay alive on a desserted island, with all her animal friends.There is a war between the islanders and the Aleuts.Also,many people die.The one thing is that her family left on a boat to get to another island.The only people she has left are: her brother Ramo and her dog friend Rontu.There are many conflicts in this book. One for example is when she tries to catch a devilfish and it is the biggest devilfish of all!The devilfish even tried to attack Rontu and Karana!!!It is a good book if you don't have anything to read.Anyway, I won't ruin the supprises, so if you want to know them, then you'll have to read/get it yourself."
3,Island of the Blue Dolphins,"The book was pretty sad, most of the characters died. Karana (the maine chacter) had long black hair.before they are left the aleuts make a deal but they do not follow thruogh, they kill all the nativs of the island exept karana and her brother. Then her brother wanders and gets killed by wild dogs. karana vowed to kill the wild dogs, but when she is about to kill the leader of the pack she does not. I think the the book was very good."
4,About Karana,"Karana was only twelve years old (had long black hair) when she saw a ship while she was picking roots. That ship in which she saw held the people that would cause all of the bad things that will happen to her. These people are the ALUETS. In a summary, the aluets killed many of Karana's tribe, caused the otter to go away for a time,were the source of the things that killed Karana's brother, and much more.In the story karana finds special friends that comfort her and be will her until the end.''This book is a mixture of happiness,saddness and love.''"
4,A book YOU could die for,"Island of the Blue Dolphins was excellent! but there were some hard times. Karana, a 12 year old girl, is trapped on an island with her little brother Ramo, wild dogs and bad storms. This book has deaths, bad storms and times were you can rejoice. Rontu, a wild dog, who Karana vows to kill,was shot in the chest by an arrow at the mouth of a cave. Karana feels sorry, takes the arrow out and brings him to her home. Rontu becomes Karanas friend and pet. I advise you to read this story, it was one of my favorites. This book also has funerals, plots and lots of trial and error."
3,Island of the Blue Dolphins,"Island of the Blue Dolphins, by Scott O'dell is a pretty good book. The is about a 13 year old girl named Karana whose Island had been attacked by the Aleuts(the white men from Europe.) The Aleuts had killed many of their people. After the attack, the chief went to find a new place for the people on the island to live in case the Aleuts came again. After a couple of months kind white men finally came to the people of the island but Karana's brother Ramo was left behind. Karana jumped off the boat and swam back to the island so that her brother wouldn't stay on the island alone. The rest of the story continues by telling how Karana and Ramo stay alone on the island."
4,Island of the Blue Dolphins Review,"I enjoyed the book and I thought it was great. My favorite character was Karana. I also felt sorry for Karana because her father died, her sister went away and then her brother died. I think that Karana was a very brave girl because she made her own shelter, made her own food and she wasn't very scaird of the wild dogs."
4,"""Bears"" rhymes with ""Everywheres""","This is a great book that my two-year old loves. Simple rhymes, lots of bears to look at and fun to read aloud. Definitely recommended."
1,"Exceedingly Lame - a review of ""Bears""","Wow, it's not very often that you see a little teddy bear hanging from a noose in a children's book. As a mom of a girl and boy (5 and 3) I was aghast. I mean, what the heck is up with that?!?Still Ruth Krauss and Sendak... I thought I'd take a further look. But my goodness. Like a bad movie that they try to make 'better' with a host of over-the-top stars, this just stinks.My children did not find the artwork cute, nor the text understandable. I read it twice myself before I realized that there just wasn't anything there.One Star. Can't recommend it to anyone. Entire text follows so you can see for yourself.Bears, bears, bears, bears, bearsOn the StairsUnder chairsWashing hairsGiving staresCollecting faresStepping in squaresMillionairesBears, bears, bears, bears, bearseverywheres"
1,Not as good as the subsequent version w/Sendak,"***NOTE*** Other reviews listed here assume this is the Sendak-illustrated book. It is not. Notice that Amazon has listed ROWLAND as the illustrator! Two very different editions, folks. Two very different sensibilities.My original review follows.It's amazing how fabulous illustrations can make a difference! Sendak's illustrations in a later edition amplify and expand the text in Ruth Krauss' book. This original version, illustrated by Phyllis Rowand, is cute, but falls flat for me."
2,"I like Ruth Krauss's work, BUT...","...this book is pretty vacuous. I'm referring to the 2005 remake, with new artwork by Maurice Sendak (who I find very hit-or-miss...) Krauss and Sendak collaborated several times in the 1950s and '60s, but this tepid outing doesn't recapture the buoyancy of those old days, as hard as Sendak may have tried. Feels like he was just coasting here, and though many parents and longtime devotees got into this one, I thought it was just plain boring. Haven't read the 1948 original. (Axton)"
4,jackie pays tribute to his influences and family,"McLean is one of the most important and innovative post-bop jazz musicians and this recording shows why. Here he pays tribute to the musicians that had influenced him in 1962 - Bird, Monk, Powell, Mingus, Miles Davis, and Ornette Coleman. The band is top notch, including the Billy Higgins on drums from the infamous Ornette Coleman quartet. The album features three original compositions, inspired by his daughter, son, and mother respectively. Bud Powell's 'I'll Keep Loving You' rounds out the outstanding session."
4,A transitional album,"Mr. McLean was working in a new idiom on this album, and he seems hesitant about using it. His phrases are often shorter and more repetitive than the phrases in the solos on earlier and later albums, which suggests to me he was unsure about how to continue his phrases. The solos are also marred occasionally by gratuitous sustained trills and honking. I've got nothing against key-wiggling or honking in their place, but they're out of place in the solos here, and they again leave the impression that he was sometimes at a loss about what to play next, especially as he doesn't wiggle keys or honk in the earlier and later work of his that I'm familiar with.But I've never met a Jackie McLean album I didn't like. A bad album by Jackie McLean is better than most other people's good albums. This one is certainly worth 4 stars and the [money] I paid for it, and the shipping. But if this is the first Jackie McLean album you've ever heard, you ain't heard nothing yet."
5,Excellent,"It was a goodm read, surprising revdelations about the catholic church and its inner workings.I think most would enjoy its forthright info."
3,shipping difficulties,"The pedestal column arrived with broken pieces. I was pleased with the column other than the damage. The damage seemed to be caused from a lack of proper packing. The column was not packed in such a way that the decorative flairs near the top were very well protected during shipping. Rather than go through the hassle and expense of a return, I glued the pieces together. I would suggest a better method of packing such a fragile shipment."
1,arrived broken,"similar to another reviewer, one of the 'leaf' pieces was broken off. Really thin plastic in this area. I glued it back on rather than the hassle of sending it back. Poor packaging from the manufacturer is likely the reason as there was no visible damage on the outside of the box."
3,Sent the wrong color,The picture of the product I ordered is a white color. When I got it the product was a form of green color. Not worth sending back. Otherwise OK
3,"Diameter is 9 1/2 "" NOT 10 1/2 "" as advertised...nice looking, but I wish it were 27 pounds rather than only 7 pounds-","Nice looking pedestal. The diameter of the top is not 10 1/2 inches as advertised but rather 9 1/2 inches. I think that it would be steadier if it were about 20 more pounds. The photo and description of this stand is a bit misleading. It appears that the top is flat (or perhaps it has a Sundial on top of it) when in fact it is concave in the center and flat around the perimeter which I was hoping it was so I could place my sundial on it (which has a screw in the center and small feet). Overall, I am satisfied."
1,No availability,"I was very disappointed: I tried to order this item and was informed that my order was cancelled because of ""a lack of availability from our suppliers"". Amazon needs to state that this is not in stock!! (forced star rating does not apply to actual quality)"
5,terrific mandoline,"I bought this specifically to make microwave potato chips and I have nothing bad to say about it. The slices are thin (see through) and perfect using no effort whatsoever. I didn't realise how scary sharp a ceramic blade could be! This item is perfect if all you really want to be able to do is make paper thin slices. There is nothing to adjust, it's compact,and easy to clean and store. I highly recommend saving the bubble package for storage as a previous reviewer suggested. Yesterday I even made beautiful cabbage shreds for coleslaw using it, just cut your cabbage into reasonable size sections."
1,Wouldn't cut hot butter,"I first tried a tomato, a really tough-skinned 'mater and came away with a mess. So then I tried a cucumber and it still made a mess. The blade seemed incredibly dull. I have returned it and cannot recommend it."
2,Problems with Plastic Connectors,This is a lovely pen but I also had problems with the plastic connectors. One of them is stuck and won't open so I can't open the pen to let the dog in. I would have to lift a 65lb dog over it.I called General Cage customer service to see if I could have it repaired or get a new connector and have it repaired myself. They told me that they no longer carry any parts because everything is made in ..................China! And they don't repair because everything is made in...........China! So too bad for the customer. As far as they were concerned it was my tough luck and I would just have to buy another. These are way to expensive to replace so often. Look for something that is made in the USA and has replacement parts available. General Cage is not what it used to be and is certainly not a Green company!
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT! COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE!!!!!,"This pen looks good and is very lightweight, but is designed terribly. Every other panel is about 2 inches off the ground which allows any dog to put their nose under it, and be out in 2 minutes or less. If you leave your dog for even a few minutes, do not expect them to be there when you return."
1,Don't waste your money,We are dog show people and purchased three of these pens to use next to our RV at dog shows. They are great for allowing a little breeze to flow through while blocking the sun. We have had them for several years and used them perhaps twenty times. We were very happy until this weekend when at least 10 of the plastic connectors broke as we were setting up. As the units will no longer stand up the entire pen was rendered worthless. Three hundred dollars wasted. After this experience I would strongly recommend you save your money and avoid buying the General Cage It's a breeze exercise pen.
4,Good,I use this for my 11 week old kitten and my older cats as well. They love it. I also have the bottom and the top cover. It is great for in door use.
5,Time-tested Approaches to Natural Healing for Animals.,"Juliette Levy is a legend in the world of natural healing. Her courage in speaking out against the unnatural methods of raising dogs, cats and farm animals often brought her much criticism, but the practices set forth in her book have stood the tests of time and have saved many an animal that might otherwise have been lost. She offers not only an extensive list of plants and their uses, but also speific protocols for a variety of illnesses, all very clearly explained and laid out. She outlines specific dietary regimines as well, for the purpose of maintaining maximum health and supporting an ill animal through the healing process. I have personally used her methods with my own animals with great success. No serious herbalist or student of natural healing should be without it."
5,A must have for every farm,"THis book is a great resource for anyone who wants to keep their animals healthy. Prevention is the best medicine, and this gives all the best prevention tips you could need. Your cattle, horses, sheep, goats, poultry and sheep dogs will thank you for purchasing this book.This book has already paid for it'sself on my farm"
4,The Complete Herbal Handbook for Farm and Stable,"Its exactly what I need to get my animals on the right track. Some of the content seems a little out there but I am seeing great results, so I'll stand by it. Our horses love the herbs and they have never looked better!"
3,Some interesting approaches,This book offers some very specific approaches which is nice but I have no idea where I would every get most of the ingredients that she lists in her concoctions. A lot of time she refers to purchasing items that look like things she sells through a company which makes me think that this is a book intended to help sell other stuff.
1,So Disappointed!,"Not sure what people were thinking when they wrote positive reviews. This book is utterly disappointing and I wish I could return it. The chicken section is essentially non-existent and has spotty, frequently inaccurate info some of which is downright dangerous. At one point the author says all mints are good for poultry, Pennyroyal, a mint is extremely poisonous. After some of what I read, I wouldn't trust anything in book. Waste of money, move on to something else! Perhaps more care goes into the sections on other animals(though I wouldn't count on it), since the author essentially calls poultry expendable. Never have I been so disappointed in a book before."
3,nostalgic,"this book is easy to read but lacks important details for a person with limited experience. the dosages are vague (handfuls of this and that),and too many common plant names are used which can lead to the use of the wrong plants. certainly Julliett was ahead of her time and deserves a place on the herbal book shelf like Adell Davis does on the nutrition shelf."
1,Save your money!!,"I have many of the breeds of animals that she refers to and was really excited about getting this book!! I am all about natural ways to take care of my animals......However,I am absolutely not impressed with this book!! Aside from the measuring that I read about and the fact that she downplays a good vetrinarian.....she doesn't even touch on the most common problems in a few of the breeds...mainly goats!! She talks about very rare and obscure things, but nothing of problems that can occur with some regularity.DISAPPOINTING!!"
2,Reads like a book from the 1800's,"While this book might have some good information, it was supposed to be a revised, updated version of a 1952 book. It read like a book out of the 1800's. I could not get past the `ye auld-fashioned' wording to what might have been informative, useful information. Really update it, and it might be a good source of great stuff."
5,This is for everyone,"Noughts and crosses is about two people who are struggling to be together in a world dominated by crosses.Persephone(sephy)is the daughter of a powerful politician who grew up with callum, her nanny's son.When circumstances tear them apart the two experience love, death and discrimination whilst trying to find a way to be together.This is a poignant story with an interesting twist on an important historic event.This should not be ignored by children,teenagers OR ADULTS and is essential reading."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"This book is an engaging and enjoyable read. The subject matter is treated with the delicacy and tact it deserves, and the writing never seems to drag. Occasionally the plot gets bogged down with all of its intricacies, but the ending wraps them all up cleanly and to utter satisfaction.I will definitely be reading this novel again. A good book to pick up if you have a long wait ahead of you that you'd like to make fly by."
4,VERY DIFFERENT INDEED,Had to keep re checking myself while reading this book. Funny how our train of thought is molded at such a young age and needs a book like this to stop and rethink our very own existence. Will definitely be reading the rest of the trilogy.
5,Undescribable,"This is by far the saddest book I've ever read. But that's why I liked it so much. I actually cried at the end. It's so weird, the way the lives of the naughts and crosses are. It's like a turn around in our history, a twist. But I must say it kept me very interested. I loved the way the characters changed toward the end, taking different paths through their years. In a way it kind of reminded me of Romeo and Juliet. This is a must read for anyone who takes pleasure in reading."
3,"Puts things in perspective, yet not as good as it could have been","This book was intended for children and it's well written for that age group. I didn't really appreciate the soap opera-style plot, which includes a lot of unnecessary drama. It really put things in perspective for me personally though, because it changes the societal postitions of blacks and whites in a very interesting manner. A better book about oppression would be ""Tesitmony of an Irish Slave Girl"" because it discussed the position change without, again, the unnecessary drama."
2,Perhaps not the best edition,"I can't vouch for the translation (this was a gift) but I didn't care for the printing quality of this edition. The margins were huge (1.25"" except on the spine) which crowded the text and I found the font to be muddy not as ""clean"" as I'd hoped. It almost looked like a reproduction of a 1910 edition and a challenge for older eyes. I returned this and purchased the El Paso Norte Press edition which had very legible print and a nicer over all feel."
1,Un happy customer,This item was advertised as new but it was an open box and and not in working condition. The item did not charge and the cooling fan did not spin. This Item was returned to vendor for refund. I am not happy with my purchase.
4,Looks good so far,"Note that this is short-term review - I just got it.Charger looks well-made and seems to work fine. Fan is much quieter than on my old 15-min charger. Old one I had to plug in in another room, this one you can barely hear.Batteries not get as warm as they used to in the old charger.One thing I don't like is that power supply is a separate ""brick"""
5,"I love it, feeling it, diggin it................BUT! ,.....","This isn't a new sound or a new style of music. After reading most of the reviews on this CD, I find it hard to believe that some people ears are not open to whats really out there. Some stated that this is a new age of music and new sound.......NO! Badu, Jazzifatnastees, Mawell, N'Dambi has already been there and done that and very well. Believe me I'm not hating on this group, just educating those who are deaf to underground urban music that's been out for many many years. I listen to this CD every day, can't but help to........it's hot! Just know that it's been done and some have done it better."
4,New School Old School,"A stellar schowcase of contemporary R&B. The strengths of this project far outshine the shortcomings. Saadiq's imprint is all over this music, and the production value is excellent, especially on the hits ""Dance Tonight"" and ""Don't Mess With My Man"" (which also had a kick-ass video).It's a shame that this supergroup didn't last, because with a little more cohesion they truly could have become something great. How about releasing at least two (or maybe even three!) albums before deciding to throw in the towel?"
5,Kickin' debut for these established artist!,"When I got this CD, I frankly didn't think it would be any good. Boy, was I sooo wrong. Every song has it's own flava and just jams. Im already looking forward to their next CD."
2,Who's gonna save urban music and R and Bee...?,"...it sure ain't LucyPearl whose slick stance promises more than it can deliver. Can't put your finger on what/who they sound like? Try the groups they came from. Nothing new here, but clothes and packaging...just like Britney Spears' new CD...if you must have a 'new CD', though, this'll do in a pinch."
1,Save Your Money....,Lucy Pearl reminds me of the fairy tale...emperor's new clothes. After months of hype about this 'supergroup' I found the actual CD to be a disappointment. Silly materialistic and inane lyrics abound and many of the songs sound the same. I'm trading the CD in as soon as I can get to my local CD shop.
1,TOO OVERATED!,"I found this album very dissapointing. People who are fans of Dawn Robinson should not waste time on the album but instead spend money on a brilliant album like En Vogue's Masterpiece Theatre. Some of the tracks seem to me like spin offs of previous En Vogue tracks. ""Without You"" is similar to ""Don't let Go"" and ""Hollywood"" is just a ""Free Your Mind"" wanna be. This album is highly overrated. Dawn needs to go back home to En Vogue."
4,Cool Music,"Definitely a tight CD! I love the songs ""Can't Stand Your Mother,"" ""La-La,"" and ""They Can't."" Raphael, Dawn, and Ali have done an excellent job. One star short for the 1st track...stick to new stuff y'all and don't look back!"
4,Good Mixture of Songs,"I was very impressed with the songs compiled on Lucy Pearl's self-titled debut album. I found myself getting pulled in to almost every single one of the groups songs. The songs move from love to loss to anger very smoothly. There is even some humor mixed in. I really enjoy listening to this album. It gives me something different and interesting to listen to when I get tired of the same old songs they play on the radio.Stand-out tracks:""Dance Tonight""""Without You""""Don't Mess With My Man"""
5,Lucy Pearl are hot!!,"Firstly, I know its an easy mistake to make but Lucy Pearl is a three-pronged group, not a solitary singer, OK?!Secondly, this album is amazing. Apart from one or two tracks this is one of those albums where you don't skip songs. The singles are a good representation of what the album's about, but it's still worth investing in.Anyone who liked ATCQ, En Vogue or Tony! Toni! Tone! will enjoy this album. Pick it up!!"
4,One of the best albums of 2000,"This album has some incredible songs on it. Raphael is superb as always and the other two couldn't be better. My favorite tracks are ""Dance Tonight,"" ""Don't Mess With My Man"", and ""LaLa""."
4,"""LUCY""'s PEARL has a pretty good shine.","Although lightweight, LUCY PEARL gave enough substance to warrant a second CD someday. All throughout the disc, there was definite traces of Raphael Saadiq's TONY, TONI, TONE' sound that made them famous and the added talents of Dawn Robinson and Ali Shaheed Muhammed only intensified the beats and brought about a new area of the neo-soul sound. Definitely a good pick for the laid back and conservative head-bopper."
4,Good Solid Debut,Lucy Pearl has a Good Solid Produced Album.Dawn Robinson Sounds as Great as Ever.Ali ShaHeed Muhammad Continues His Grooves.Miss Tribe Call Quest.this is Raphael Saadiq's Year.Having Produced Tracks On D'Angelo's Album&THe Great Vocals He Lays Down On DJ Quik's New Album on the SOng Well are Great.He Really Shines On this Set as well.Still I Miss The Tony's.EveryBody Brings Something too the Table On this Set.THey Cover Much Musical Ground.Hollywood Is The Cut.I Hope they Stay Together.You Get the feeling with their Talent they Could Be a Force.
4,"R&B, with instruments no less...","This is the R&B i love... the kind that has actual instruments being played, with live vocals... it suprises me that more bands don't make this classic sound. Even with the usual bling bling track ""Dance Tonite"", this album defies all the typical hip hop rules and makes you sit up and take notice. Best Songs-Don't Mess With My Man and Can't Stand Your Mother. Buy it if you're sick of canned beats, bad samples, and crap feature artists. This cd is the real deal..."
5,This album preserves soul music,"I waited for this CD the instant I heard about the collaboration between Dawn, Raphael and Ali Shaheed. In all honesty, it may not be a new sound, but it pays homage to true R&B that all soul music lovers live for. This album is creative, and each song is VERY different and will match whatever mood you are in. All of the artists are extremly gifted individuals. It is wonderful to hear their skills (on wax) again.The Dance Tonight remix is wonderful. Takes me back to a grambling state football game or something.Buy this, you will not be disappointed"
4,Lay back and enjoy the ride!,"This debut CD by this group is tight! There are times when some of the songs seem to be lacking like missing something, but then you hear LaLa and Everyday and Dance Tonight and you know this group is da bomb. This CD puts me in the mind of like Brand New Heavies meets Maxwell and Lauryn Hill. I will be curious to see if there sound gets more mature on their sophmore album. But this CD is definitely worth having."
3,"GOOD, BUT....","i like lucy pearls album, its got some fun, catchy tunes. but the problem is the LENGTH of the songs!! too many good songs fall short of even THREE minutes, most barely make over that mark.am i being picky? songs need to be longer than this. it just seems too much like a demo, not a serious attempt at a real album. hopefully they will rectify this next time."
3,INTERESTING..........................,"This cd was cool. It has some mellow, but not typical grooves. I liked it."
2,An Unpleasant Surprise,"How can performers that rose from strong, innovative groups put out something so mediocre? I guess it's been done before with Gerald Levert, Keith Sweat, and Johnny Gill's bland LSG project. I sifted through this CD and while some tunes had my toes tapping, not one song completely stood out besides that one ditty ""Dance Tonight"". Bottom line....more time should have been spent on production."
1,Dont belive the Hype,"This so called supergroup was definatly hurt by the hype. I had high hopes for this group, as I love En Vogue (whos current cd is thier best work yet, the women proved that dawn really didnt have much of an impact on the life blood of the group), I liked toni tony tone`, and I loved Tribe Called Quest. The cd is average mostly, with a few shiners (Hollywood, Dance Tonite, and Remember the time being the only notable tracks) thrown in to keep you listening. I saw a webcast from the group saying they made enough songs for two albums, I cant help but wonder if this is the best, how horrid are the rest? If there wasnt such a hype around this group, from themselves included, maybe I would have rated it higher. En Vogue's new cd came out the same day, and im sure Lucy Pearl will outsell them due to hype, but I belive En Vogue will be around much longer than this so called ""R&B Supergroup"". Save your money."
1,Buy En Vogue instead!,A very mundane cd. Two listens and I removed it from the changer. En Vogue's Masterpiece Theatre is a much better choice. I was very dissapointed after all the hype!
3,A little on the commercial side,"I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I knew how. This cd is a little on the commercial side for me. I do like the combination of artists. The last time I paid attention to en vogue and 3Ts was late 80's early 90's. I have always loved Quest. I think Everyday, Good Love and Remember the Times are my favs. Hollywood reminds me of R&B meets Led Zep or Black Sabbath. It doesn't come across right. Of course Dance Tonight's radio play sparked my interest in the cd but if you haven't bought it yet and are not sure about it-you'll live."
3,"The Good, The Bad, the Ugly","I'm not saying that this albumn doesn't have some really nice tracks. There's a really good song featuring Q-Tip and Snoop, of course ""Dance Tonight"" is hot, and there are some other really smooth tracks. I find that most of the songs are not bad. Then there's some terrible songs like ""Hollywood"". I don't know how they could put that track on the same albumn as some of the good songs. I think maybe instead of picking this cd up, just borrow it from a friend who already has it."
2,LUCY PEARL IS LUCY DIAMONIQUE.,"First, Dawn Robinson formerly of En Vogue should go back to her former music heritage....and listen to ""Masterpiece Theatre"" and see what she has missed.Lucy Pearl has promise, but this CD just fails to deliver...there are some nice touches like ""Dance Tonight"" and ""Lala"", but the album just fades into slow beats that repeat in each song....the album gets very repetitive after the 3rd song, before you know it the album is over and you think you have listened to the same song throughout the album.The vocals are wonderful and the production is great, but Lucy Pearl needs to step it up a little and make the songs sound more diverse.A fair effort at best, I only recommend it for diehard Dawn Robinson fans."
3,You get what you pay for,"The clips are too stiff to easily use. Don't expect to get it around a large caliber buoy eye. To be fair, I've only used them in cold circumstances. I have no qualms with the line."
1,Plastic Snap Hook Breaks,Both of the plastic snap hooks broke under very light use (Within two weeks of purchase). When the first one broke my wave runner floated away I was there and had to go in and get it. I would not recomend this product.
3,Worth it ... Maybe!,"The best that can be said for these ""dock lines"" is that they're cheap and probably worth the price. But dock lines in the conventional sense, they are not. Compared with conventional dock lines ... even relatively cheap twisted three-ply nylon, these are stiff, short and don't hold well to an ordinary dock cleat unless you use them full length and use the end loop."
5,Dock lines were as advertized and shipped quickly,Very happy with the quality and service. I would recommend this set to anyone needing boat or kayak dock lines.
1,Cheap,The plastic hooks broke the first time we used them and we had to replace them with metal ones. The rope is good quality.
4,Basic rope,"Bought these to use on my jet ski. The plastic hook is too big to fit through the eye on the front of mine and my friends' PWC's. To get around this, I just loop the rope through and clip the rope. Not a big deal.Not a good docking rope because it's so long, but it has various other uses. If you need a rope on your PWC (which you do), I recommend this cheap basic rope."
5,"Tow, Cleat Ropes",I like them they work very will for temporary securing to boat dock or cleats when I launch or return.
4,Works great for holding onto my jetski (pwc).,"These are nice PWC dock lines or lines to just hang on to your Jetski (PWC). I have not had any problem with the Hook breaking yet but if it does I have SS hooks that I will use. This is a decent inexpensive line for a Jetski (PWC). I have a big 3 pass Seadoo and was easily able to attach the hook to the front bow eye. However, if you are worried about the hook breaking then probably best that you look for a dock line with a metal hook."
4,It's a rope,"I'm not crazy about the clasp on the end but it does the trick and I can put a different clasp on. I use it mainly for pulling my kayak around in the river when I'm out of the boat fishing, going up shallow rapids, etc.. Perfect length rather than using the anchor rope. I'm probably guilty of basing at least part of the purchase decision on the fact that ""it matches"" my anchor rope from the same company. Plus it's a 2-pack and my bro and I both needed one."
2,Fizzles out halfway through.,"This film started well - I'm a big Spencer Tracy fan, and he's as good as ever in this noirish mystery. But it quickly gets convoluted and dull. The whole thing is like a Victorian gaslight melodrama, and about that interesting, with everything revealed in the last reel. Hepburn is stagey and doesn't get to use her fine comedy talents in a one dimensional role. The ending, the big secret, is signposted throughout the movie, but it will still come as a surprise, since you will have convinced yourself that it is too preposterous to be what you thought it was. Like I say, Tracey is good, but not even he can save this turkey."
2,Flameout,"Hard to imagine Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn being lousy together: until you see them in this Popular Front catastrophe fron 1942. The conspiracy theory of those days among Hollywood leftists was that there were Fascist fifth columnists under every bed and they had to be rooted out. Reporter Tracy is rooting under widow Hepburn's bed to get the goods on her late husband. Tracy was not politcally sympathetic to the project and he looks thoroughly discouraged and annoyed from scene one. The crummy script and abominable sets didn't help any. Politics is always a touchy subject in the movies; it usually doesn't date well. Some films, like ""For Whom the Bell Tolls,"" can shrug off the rhetoric and still be great years later. Others, like ""Keeper of the Flame,"" sink like a stone."
3,Pretty Good,"Star maps is a film based upon interesting ideas. It deals with events concerning an 18 year old Mexican male(Carlos), played by Douglas Spain, who wishes to ""make it"" in Hollywood. This film has a dark tone as it examines the male prostitution ring, alienation and greed. This melodramatic film has some very potent moments, but never quite develops them or some of its characters. Star Maps is an uneven allegorical study concerning the depth of a persons passion to reach their goals, and to what extremes they wish to achieve them. Overall an interesting film. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
4,"Not perfect, but challenging, disturbing and unique","Odd, brave, if not completely successful drama.A Mexican father in Los Angeles forces his son, who wants to be an actor, into prostitution.The story details his misadventures in Hollywood in both the sexual and movie making arenas, as wellas the completely dysfunctional family that surrounds him.Much like Arteta's later films, there's a surreal humor under it all, and a genuineweirdness at how matter of fact its all treated. Good use of music as well.Some of the acting could have been better, which would have elevated it considerably.But it still is a unique, and strangely entertaining look at a warped and dysfunctional world."
4,"A Great movie, but not for the faint-hearted.","If subtle, off-beat humor mixed with sex, prostitution, and violence is your thing, then this is the movie for you. It's a realistic (as far as I can tell) story of a confused young boy, with dreams of becoming a famous Hollywood actor. His Father wants him to work for the family business, and has him trapped. He sneakily tries to use his Father's business to fulfill his own dreams. The acting isn't top notch, but believable (what d'ya expect for a low-budget movie). The plot was very different and entertaining, and the movie had me welded to my seat. Give it a shot...you'll see. Not recommended for those cold nights with the fireplace going and snuggling up next your honey, playin' kissy-face-huggy-bear. Unless your sick, sick, SICK! --By the way, a great soundtrack, too."
1,worst of the worst,its one of the worst movies ive ever seen....bad plot and acting...i saw in a theatre years ago....my friend fell asleep during the movie..very amateurish overall.
2,Amatureish but gritty,"A ""summer stock"" vision of mexican boys brought to the USA to hustle under the guise of selling maps to the stars homes in Hollywood. Some good performances but mostly the dialog is stilted and it sounds like the screenwriters first attempt. Too many sub-plots and intrigues muddy up what could be an interesting film a la JOHNS and My Own Private Idaho from an ethnic perspective. Worth watching when the price drops."
5,Great Prime Live Rory Gallagher,"IRISH TOUR 74 was a great live album by Rory Gallagher, ranking with CALLING CARD and TATTOO as one of his top three. It was recorded in such places as Cork, Dublin, and Belfast, the latter a place where few artists dared perform at that time due to the Irish Republican Army fighting with British troops there. However, Gallagher did the tour, and the result is one of the most criminally-overlooked live albums of all time."
5,A timeless masterpiece-as good today as it was back then,"I still remember attending a Jethro Tull concert in the 70's with an opening act of an irishman named Rory Gallagher who I had never heard of at the time. I was so blown away that I left midway through Tulls set to try and find an open record shop. I have owned much of Rory Gallaghers music since that time. Irish Tour '74 is the definitive Rory Gallagher masterpiece. Of particular note is ""Walk on hot coals"". While it is generally hard to listen to one track which is more than 11 minutes long,you will find yourself replaying this one. In the past,some critics have made the statement that Rory Gallagher is as good a guitar player as Clapton, Page,etc. I think they are wrong. Clapton and Page were almost as good as Rory Gallagher! Give this particular CD a listen and I know you will agree. We miss you, Rory."
5,If you love good guitar playing JUST BUY IT,"Rory is among the great unspoken and unknown guitar heroes of the 70's. Such a shame for the music business. If you like amazing guitar playing, soulfull writing and having a good time with music just listen to A million miles away. Sure you gonna buy it. Just one of the finnest blues rock CDs you gonna find."
5,Ladies and gentlemen: Rory Gallagher!,"The fiery moods of this legend of the guitar; the fevered commitment he displayed around every work, reveals the greatness of his talent.So, at the moment to regard the twelve greatest living performances ever made, this album should be as a constant in every list.This album carves in relief Gallagher in the peak of his musical powers. Not only a tresured document for these new generations. It goes further: it's part of the legend.So, the question doesn't turn around to purchase it or not. The question is how can you boast of having an invaluable rock collection leaving aside this gem?"
5,a killer album!,"IT'74 is one of the best (if not the best) live albums ever made. all the tracks rock!!!. too much alcohol, cradle rock and the excellent walk on hot coals are my personal favorites. it's pure high octane blues-rock, something so hard to find these days. just go and buy it."
1,TOO SMALL,"I assumed they were the size of a standard frisbee ring so I purchased 10.Once they arrived, I was very dissapointed that they were so small and made of such thick rubber. My dog won't go near them."
2,Just template,I wish that they would have worked harder at actually teaching the language rather than just giving boilerplate examples
5,Authentic Thai Fish Sauce,"If you are planning on making some thai recipes at home this is the best Thai fish sauce money can buy. Add some sugar, some water, mint cilantro and chilies and you'll have a staple of Thai cooking, serve that dressing with Spring rolls, Thai noodles and even brussels sprouts and you'll have a hit! Check out my blog for a nice recipe using that stuff."
5,Very Good,"I am the primary cook in our home and have developed a taste for Thai food during my business travels. No local restaurants fill this niche so I researched some recipes and found a few that looked good - but they required fish sauce (among other hard to find ingredients). Ordered this from Amazon and although I have no basis for saying whether this is a good or bad quality product, the recipes turned out top notch. Greatly exceeded my expectations. Although this fish sauce was only one of many ingredients, it played a part in the final menu so I will rate it as such.On the down side - I think it is pricey for what it is and the seller shows no mercy on shipping. It is probably manufactured for penny's a gallon but I guess it goes back to supply and demand and where I live, there is no local supply."
3,Half A Book: Not Half Bad,"Most people familar with the full body of Wheeler's recorded work agree that she is at her best when her producers and studio musician take the day off and her vocal craftmanship and guitar skills are left to shine through. Unfortunately the producers and mixers had a heyday on Half a Book resulting in an overly slick production just doesn't hold up as well as her other albums.First-time Wheeler listeners would be better served by ""Circles and Arrows"" and ""Sylvia Hotel,"" both outstanding efforts.As good as Wheeler is on CD, don't miss a chance to see her in person. She's a superb performer."
