1,Not worth the trouble of straining to hear it.,"I am hearing impaired and the subtitles do not work. I have read that there is a way to mess around with the way your tv is attached to your player that makes it sort of work but is it worth the trouble?I would have wished for more historical accuracy. I'm not terribly knowledgeable about this period but after a certain point I found myself muttering.. ""Oh come ON.. no way they looked like that."" or ""I'll bet what REALLY happened was WAY more interesting.""It doesn't HAVE to be historically accurate to be entertaining.. it doesn't HAVE to have actors cast that remotely resemble who they are playing or have more to offer then eye candy to be interesting. No one who knows me would fault my imagination and suspension of disbelief. I could watch this story played by actors made out of legos probably and enjoy it.. but I need to understand what they are saying."
5,Excellent fun!,"I am in love with this show... For Entertainment purposes the show is tons of fun... an amazingly beautiful cast of great actors, gorgeous scenery locations, and beautiful costumes from the time period. It may not be factual to history, but it is a TV Show. Many shows are intended for entertainment value and I believe thats right where this one is, loosely based on facts (but then again who really knows). I am a fan of the Renaissance/Medieval time period, but can enjoy this for what it is. Those that want a show strict to fact will be disappointed. However if you can sit back and enjoy the ride, knowing its extremely loose on facts, I can't see how you wouldn't love it :)"
2,I Was a Teenage Tudor,"This series begins well, but the quality is not sustained. After three or four episodes it becomes silly, the plot meanders, and attention is sustained only be frequent sex and nudity -- which start out well but soon become crass and pointless, as happened in ROME. The casting is good in some cases, very bad in others. So after buying the whole set we gave up watching half way."
4,"Lovely, Sexy and Inaccurate","Sean Bean would have been more accurate as Henry seeing as he was 42 when he met Anne and he would have dyed his hair. Henry was ginger! The history is fiction but the production is brilliant, sexy and addictive. I'm so anticipating the next season and re-watching season one."
2,"Hampton Court, 90210","Others have done a fine job of pointing out the multitude of inaccuracies; this is nothing but spiced-up, Hollywood-ized junk.The real story of Henry is far more compelling and interesting than this Tudor ""Entourage"" in Burger King costumes.Even though it is nearly 40 years old, the BBC production, ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" is still fantastic, and infinitely more interesting and accurate."
4,Nice escapism,"Although the show has numerous historical inaccuracies, the show is a nice diversion when compared with other dramas. Do not watch the show for historical accuracy; it you do you will be disappointed."
4,Great show and DVD!,Bought this for my husband who really enjoys this show. We are both pleased with the purchase.
5,Merry old England,"Not paying atention in history, I did not know very much about King Henry. This is very interesting and the show is very well done. Great acting and I'm ready for Season two."
1,"Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends","Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...there is that enough words?"
1,Racist,This is one of the worst tv shows in recent history.The historical inaccuracies are unacceptable.The racism towards Portugal is insulting.This tv serial deserves to be highly criticized because it displays huge historical errors and it is a racist and insulting tv show.
4,Love the show,"Love the show Although it's not an accurate story, the movie itself was an entertaining. Jonathan Rhys is great, so do the rest of the casts. I didn't know that this movie was made since 2007 until recently. I have been watching the show on BBC every Wednesday since. However, the quality of the movie from the CD I had purchased from the vendor at Amazon appears to be not as sharp and bright as the actual show I had seen from BBC channel. Couldn't wait to see what happens to Jane in the next season and when the king starts to age."
3,Miscast lead role,"I rented this series to help me decide whether I should buy it. I very much enjoyed the lavish sets and the drama in general and found most of the historical inaccuracies only slightly detracting. However, I could not suspend my disbelief enough to accept the slight and dark figure of Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the tall, robust, and fair Henry VIII. I would have much preferred Steven Waddington (Buckingham) as Henry. At this time my disappointment in the miscast of the lead role discourages me from buying the series. Incidentally, I found Catherine (Maria Doyle Kennedy) and Ann Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) to be perfectly cast."
2,Watch Out for Defective Copies,"Watch out. The version of the DVD I bought has 2 copies of episode 8 - and no copy of episode 9. Since episode 9 is fairly critical, that's a downer."
4,"Highly stylized, but a lot of fun!","The Tudors is a highly stylized portrayal of King Henry VIII's reign. Meaning while it is beautifully portrayed and a lot of fun, it isn't really historically accurate. That being said, the costumes are beautiful, the casting job really is excellent, and it's a great series to watch if you have some free time! Pity there are only 10 episodes per season!"
4,Tudors Season I,"Wonderful price for such an amazing, extravegent show! Every episode was better than the next, in that the drama only intensified. The only downside to the item is the lack of bonus features, but the episodes themselves make up for it."
4,"add a bit of history, a bit of softcore porn = pure entertainment","Okay so this is junk TV at its best. It's like those gossip magazines that I love reading while I'm waiting in the grocery store line. I know the stories are probably false but I still read them for the entertainment value. The writers intended this series to be loosely based on historical references, but some of the scandals, major background events, and characters are fact. In real life, Henry VIII was already in his 40s when he met Anne who was just in her teens. He wasn't the hot and steamy Jonathan Rhys Meyers which I won't argue against. People who are complaining about the historical inaccuracy of this show, go watch PBS or the History Channel instead. The ads for this show have cleavages and sex plastered all over, so it's clearly expected that the storyline needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The script is still very well written despite all the fabrications and sexcapades. Season 2 and 3 are even better!"
5,Fantastic,i have watched all 4 seasons and will re watch them!! I love this period in history!! The actors are so believable!!!
1,No Commentary. Bonus features repeats of Showtime series,"I was very disappointed with the DVD set. I loved the series on Showtime and saw all the ""making of"" types of features, so naturally I preordered the set. Not a single episode had audio commentary. The bonus features were previously aired episodes of Californication, Penn & Teller's BS, and This American Life. The other features (such as a Tudor London tour) had already been available as Showtime filler."
1,Sickening!,"This movie was not tastefully constructed. It contains explicit, meaningless sex. Disgusting violence and sickening language. We all know part of the story is true, however, much could be left to ones imagination."
5,Great Buy for the price..,I was lucky to purchase this series at such a Great Price prior to the increase...
2,"I'm sorry, I can't get past the hair","Everyone in this series looks like they just got back from Super Cuts. Why would they go to such lengths to make costumes and sets authentic, and then give everyone 21st century hair? I can't watch it. Everyone's hair is just so ridiculously anachronistic. It's not as if there is any lack of portraits of these people."
2,Not thrilled,"As a serious Tudor buff this series was on a whole disappointing - a soap opera set in Tudor England starring Henry the VIII. The costumes, the hairstyles and even the speech patterns all wrong! Forget about historical fact. Tudor history has so much rich political and religious intrigue it could keep any scriptwriter in material for years why the writers felt they had to fictionalize I do not know.The cast is ok, although Henry the VIII never ages, and some of the cast choices left me scratching my head, Sam Neill as Cardinal Wolsey just was not convincing.I would recommend this for anyone who likes costume dramas without any expectations. This is not historical fact, but that is why they call it Showtime."
3,historical view of Henry VIII,"I wouldn't have chosen the star that played Henry the Eighth--so I now aware of my vision and my attitude of Henry VIII - I did think him arrogant to have so much power but I saw HIM differently from the series. So I have a little adjustment to the manner or path that is taken to get to the same spot. Learning another view.I receive Tudor very, very quickly. Felt like I asked, blinked and it was at my home.Barbara Henson"
5,Tudors and John Adams Video Movies,"I purchased these as gifts. I watched John Adams previously and wanted my daughter, a teacher, to have it for her class. I watched season II of the Tudors and enjoyed it, but have not seen season I, so I purchased it as a gift for one of my adult children; so now I can borrow it and catch up."
2,"Historical drama for the ""hip""","Historical drama for viewers who need sex and violence to make it more interesting and watchable. Myself, I don't need that edge. Yes, the times had both, in abundance, but it doesn't need to be shown on a tv show in abundance. But then I remembered this was ""Showtime"" not ""Masterpiece Theater"" I'll take Masterpiece every time. Glad I got the first episode free, because I certainly won't pay to watch this."
3,too much un-needed sex,"I like HBO and I like history. This show has good production values and a fine cast and story, but watching it it just seemed like just because HBO can show naked people having sex they seem to feel they have to. Sex is fine and it can be used to farther a story, but it got to the point where it was too distracting and often unnecessary."
2,Disappointing,"As soon as I heard about this series, I couldn't wait to buy the DVD since I'm not a Showtime subscriber. What a disappointment it has been.The historical inaccuracies are annoying but forgivable. My biggest concern with this version of Henry is that JRM plays him in a way that makes the character very unsympathetic and unlikable. This Henry is only arrogant, obsessive and cruel. Does he truly care about anyone? There is very little vunerability or true kindness ever shown. Without showing a more multi-faceted, complex character, it's very hard to care how things play out for Henry and his court. If not for the other characters, the costumes and photography, this series would be not be worth watching."
4,Royally Entertaining !,"For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by Henry VIII. So of course I was excited when Showtime presented The Tudors! If you're someone who wants everything to be 100% accurate to history, then this isn't for you. But if you can put that aside and just appreciate the series for what it is, you'll love it. You can see all the glamour and gore of the Tudors. Henry VIII was a true Renaissance man, and this series shows that quite well. The costumes and sets are just amazing. View it as Historical Fiction, if you must. It's quite enjoyable and after watching one episode, you'll be eager to see all of them..."
5,Tudors- review by Nick,Fascinating...intriguing...powerful....dynamic....rich.... this is how I would describe this series... Outstanding piece of cinema creation. A must see series. Excellent... can not wait for season no. 2
3,Easy now folks. It's entertainment,"Although I have enjoyed reading the reviews on here for the Tudors I am surprised at the passion that is present in many of the comments. After all this is not a historical mini series nor does it make claim to be ""accurate"". It is after all SHOWTIME and it is a television mini-series.If you are looking to gain knowledge and an accurate historical portrayal perhaps you should not look to SHOWTIME.But if you are looking for well acted performances and stunning visual imagery then you will enjoy this show. It is entertainment and this show is ENTERTAINING.Here's an idea...switch the channel on your remote control to the History channel an kick back with some popcorn and a refreshing drink and let the rest of us enjoy the ART that has been created by so many talented professionals.It is all ART. And it is subjective but consider the source before you judge so harshly.Cheers."
2,Not nearly as good as I expected,I was disappointed in the storyline. It was all over the place. Characterization not as fleshed out as I hoped.
1,Terrible (pornographic) period drama,"I really loved the idea of this show because I love period dramas, the costumes, the dialogue...but this was awful. It also seemed like Showtime took the soft core porn agle to the limits here. When you have amazing shows like Downton Abbey it really puts you off of highly produced and over stylized shows like this."
2,Amazingly boring,"What show are the rest of these reviewers watching? I was excited to see this after reading the reviews, but barely made it through the first two hours. Incredibly boring, like a lavish network soap with all that implies. The history is sketchy; if you're going to twist history, at least make it fun and appealing in some way that the truth does not.This is one of the slowest and most unpleasant tv shows I have seen in some time. Then again, I don't watch tv, only tv shows on dvd that reviewers I usually trust found to be good. Guess that's not the best way either! Oh well, I found The Office (the funny version) and Arrested Development that way, so it can't be all bad. Didn't work this time, though.Pass."
1,Mind-numbingly boring!,"As someone who values plot and dialog over car (or horse) chases and random gore, I really tried to give this series a chance--especially since I'd just finished HBO's amazing series, ""Rome"". But I couldn't get past this show's failure to show much of anything beyond Jonathan Rhys Meyers alternately pouting or staring sultrily at the camera. I had no objection to the series' deviation from history; I object to its weak storytelling, bad acting, and total lack of imagination! Poor sets (they only put thought into the clothing), virtually no battles, and the sensibilities of a soap opera make this series vacuous and painfully bad. The writers of this show have no idea how to create tension and characterization. Natalie Dormer has a certain, haunting appeal about her, but this show is really better served with the sound off."
4,A show that will spark your need for more history,"First, I have taught history for over 20 years and I am well aware of the license given this show. But despite the many errors (which all shows exhibit), this show will cause you to want to read REAL history that will provide the truth. I applaud the show's effort and it certainly provides entertainment. Without which, this show couldn't be made. So watch the drama and read the history. Shows like this and HBO's Rome will certainly spark your interest in the real thing!!!"
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this season, it was filled with yummy eye candy (Johnathon Rhys Meyers -soon to be Dracula & Henry Cavil - the new man of steel) Granted, the story line does take some ""made for TV moments"" but can you blame em? After all sometimes the truth wouldn't be as juicy without a little added ingredients here and there!Overall I think if your a fan of the Tudor stories, of King Henry VIII or even curious or looking for a period piece then give it a go, sit back and let the sex, blood and passion engulf you. In my opinion its a fun and visually satisfying treat, and the adds and mixes to the story line are forgivable."
2,Henry the Rock Star,"If you like your Henry IIIX with the mentality of a spoiled rock star or NFL player, then this series will be okay for you. While his advisors run the ship of state, this Henry is busy hustling the court groupies and tearing up hotel (er, castle) rooms. Although intelligent and subtle performances are turned in by the actors who play supporting roles such as Thomas Moore and Cardinal Wolsey, this version of Henry could never have separated from Rome to form the first secular nation in the Christian world. He cares far more about chasing booty and jousting and running his dogs than picking up a book or a treaty and actually sitting down to think (and behave) like the most cunning and significant king of his time."
3,The Hooters,"Take a bunch of modern hunky Hollywood-type dudes and pair them with a bevy of Hollywood-type babes, then clothe them all (on occasion) in period costumes and you get 'The Tudors'. OK to watch, and certainly better than most standard broadcast television fare, but that's all. Not even close to being in the same league as many of the other fantastic Showtime series (like Dexter, Brotherhood, etc.) or the many superb offerings from HBO (like Deadwood, Rome, etc.) that are available on DVD. 'The Tudors' is a disappointing, fairly lightweight adult soap opera."
4,LOVE IT!!,"This show is awesome. YES it is historically incorrect in so many ways, but it is entertaining to watch. Mind you, if they had input the actual history in the way it happened it would be just as entertaining; but still it's great. I highly recommend it"
5,"Fantastic, Entertaining and Mesmerizing!","If you want undisputed history there is a channel for it and its called the History channel. If you want fantastic, mesmerizing entertainment then Showtimes 'The Tudors' is the way to go. Its got everything a good show should; drama, violence, sex, villians, mystery, etc...The cast is brilliant, the set is realistic, the filming is great. I highly recommend it!"
1,disgusting,"I only watched the first 15 minutes but, as a historian and a mother, I was appalled. The sex scene was so graphic that it ruined any possibility of it lending itself as an educational resource. Totally unnecessary to the historicity and story. Henry's character or lack thereof could have been expressed without the borderline pornography. Wonderful costumes and attention to detail. I write history curriculum for children and love the study of this period. Unfortunately, just too crude for this viewer."
1,This is disgusting!,"I was so excited to see this show after watching the first episode online months before the DVD was released. When I got the first season from the library I was over-the-moon excited to watch all the episodes. I began watching the first episode, & I was revolted to see how much sex and nudity there was. I'm an 18 year old girl, I love shirtless guys, but I don't love naked guys. It could've been such a good show, if there wasn't so much sex. It's just wrong! If there wasn't so much nudity, I'd surely give this show 5 stars, but that totally ruined it for me, & I never finished watching the first episode. Thumbs down from me."
2,never even got the movie,"i never recived the movie and i am waiting for my refund from amazon. They send me by accidnet another movie, which i already send back to them."
1,The Tudors,"It is a good thing you asked about my selection on the ""First complete Season "" of the Tudors!!! Let me tell you. I was just about to write to you. It is not the complete season. I recived six episodes with the information of seven episodes. IT IS INCOMPLETE. The Actual complete season has ""TEN or ELEVEN EPISODES"". I wrote to customer service and they send me a second set and it was the same as the first. Your add says "" A complete First Season"" . You are wrong. I am requesting my money back. As soon as I get credit I will send it back. I ordered it on November 2007, arrived on January 2008. $27.99 plus shipping and handling. I am keeping ""Anne of the Thousand Days /Mary Queen of Scots"" My total order was $42.98. Give me credit for the ""Tudors."" I expect a reply. Mrs. Villavicencio"
5,The Tudors- The Complete First Season,Can hardly wait for season two on DVD! Although I'm watching it unfold this season. I sent the first season to my daughter and she's hooked too. Thank You Amazon for 1. Having it. 2. The low cost!!! I was really happy with your price! I will always start with Amazon when I am looking for something!
3,"tolerable, but lots of missed potential","Casting could have been better here, as could some of the acting. The music is nothing great either, and I don't care much for the fellow playing Henry. The first season drags out all the business with Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, and Thomas Wolsey, also.The costumes and locations are wonderful, and there is some entertainment to be had. Apparently the history is inaccurate, though I can't really comment on that since I am not that familiar with the era and people involved.Okay for a cheap rental, but nobody needs to purchase this."
1,Inaccurate garbage,This is so inaccurate historically it is laughable. I won't waste any more of my time watching it. Glad I didn't pay for what I watched. That would have been daylight robbery.
3,good reading but binding falling apart,"I have all the books on Bonnie and Clyde, and this is one of the better written books. I have read it once and pages are all falling out."
5,Nice Bonnie & Clyde overview with just the facts.,This is a nice condenced overview of Bonnie and Clyde. If you want a crash course or are just interested in the true story- start here.
4,The love songs and beautiful. But the first CD was better,"I love the songs Naked to the Pain, and The Swing. Naked to the Pain was a beautiful song and it touched my soul. The whole CD was great. I can't wait til the next one."
4,I heard their music in of all things a horror movie and it was great,"Of all places at the end of a horror movie ""Wishmaster 4"".. I heard this song that reminds me of amiee mann or something and I thought to myself ""Who is this"", the song was ""the way we choose"". Its a very nice song and It prompted me to find out who the band was. I have yet to get the album but just based on the two songs in the movie this band is worth listning to. It just goes to show you that there is good music EVERYWHERE. I am just surprised that I have never heard of this band before."
4,Janes Fighting Ships of WW1,"I needed a book that covered all types of fighting ships that were involved during WW1. Both German and British and American,etc. I have a computer submarine simulation game that simulates German submarines during WW1. I needed to put together a list of British warships that I could use as reference,when I hit with torpedo or deck gun and sank it in the game. That way I could keep a tally of all the ships that I sunk representing real ships that existed during WW1. Whether they were sunk or not. My only dislike is that they did not have a comprehensive list British Colliers and Coast Guard ships that served the British navy during WW1. Hence only 4 stars instead of five."
2,written by a fan for fans,"Neil Slaven is honest about his personal love for Frank Zappa music. Unfortunately the result is a sycophantic homage which tends to be a bit pedestrian. A very sincere book, painstakingly assembled from many sources, but it told me nothing new."
5,"well researched biog,more impartial than e.g.michael gray's","I found this book provided more detail on zappa's early years,and also gave a truer account of what contemporaries thought of zappa (i.e a bit of an intellectual).Neal Slaven has taken full advantage of being able to examine the whole of zappa's life and work;unlike previous biographies which had to make assessments with new works still appearing. In summing up more critical than some previous books yet still appreciative."
2,Very Little That's New,"Not a bad read if you're a fan, although it's mostly a mashup of reviews, with very little comment from the author himself. It concentrates excessively on the early (""original"") Mothers albums which is really a very small subset of Frank's overall output. Very little content about Frank or his family, and disasters like the breakup of the 1988 touring band are glossed over in a paragraph or two."
3,electric don quixote,A biographer should at the very least know the correct name of his subject. The man's name is Frank Vincent Zappa. Perhaps Neil Slaven would be a better fit at CNN where research is an afterthought.
1,Don't buy this product,"It is awful. The interview process asks all the easy, basic stuff, but when it comes to the tough parts like filling out schedules, you're on your own.The ""free state software"" is not the business edition. It's for personal taxes. Pure deceit. And guess what? The only place you can buy the Business Tax State edition is through TaxCut for another [$$$]. Pure greed."
3,Easy to use but misleading!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This software was very easy to use - I would give it five stars based on the user friendliness. However - I am a bit frustrated by the fact that they mislead people into believing it includes free state tax software. Yes - it does - but it only includes personal state tax software, not the business software. Is this a personal federal package? NO - it is a business package it should include a business state package. Just another way to trick the public into buying something based on a misleading gimmic!"
4,Useful book,This book was useful to me in some previous trips to Italy. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish the info was kept more current.
4,Great Buy,When a decision was made with not much time left before Halloween was here. Amazoncame thru. Fast shippping and quality costume that wore great. son very happy.
5,very satisfied. looks good. good value.,bought three of these fixtures. they're hanging in a 1915 Edwardian in San Francisco. wanted lights which would suggest the period but not spend a bundle. the finish on mine are what I see in the photo ... an antiqued bronze with brown as the major color. the packing was sturdy and we experienced no problems. they work. they look good. they are well-priced. oh my.
1,Cheep,"I bought this locket w/ intention of giving it to my grandmother. There is NO WAY I would ever insult her w/ this cheep locket. The locket doesn't feel dense, and there is no luster. The loop used to hang it from the chain and the the clasp to hold the locket closed doesn't look like it would stand up to any wear. If I can return this I will. It is a piece of junk!"
3,a little over the top,"I had the unit installed by a professional auto trim/aftermarket shop. They struggled setting up or ""tuning"" the system. It took the tech a long time reading the manual which must be japanese reverse translated to english because it didn't/doesn't make much sense. you have to read each instruction 2-3 times. the set up is not at all intuitive so common sense and logic are not much help. once set up it is awesome. now I'm afraid to try to tweek the equalizer for fear of screwing it up. Oddly after 2 hours the tech said he was going to get this system for his car."
2,Interesting documentary for class,I ordered this book for a class on oppression & resistance in Latin America. It gives an excellent perspective on the historical treatment of Jews in Peru.
5,Beauty for Ashes,Gave this as a gift. Love the theme songs on the DVD. Will consider as future gift. Service and quality great.
1,erroneous sku?,i ended up purchasing this stick locally since trying to buy it from amazon was problematic. apparently the sku is wrong?
3,Pros & Cons,"We've owned 3 of these - purchased at Whole Foods.Pros: We keep purchasing them b/c our 1.5 y.o. can easily open & close it herself. It's BPA & Phthalate Free. It's transparent so you can see how much liquid is left easily. It's standard size so fits in cupholders. It's a very toddler-friendly, easy to handle size. The straw is soft so doesn't get chewed into a squished narrow opening like many hard straws do.Cons: Not durable. Our daughter dropped 1 of our 3 from the kitchen table to the floor and a huge circle hole cracked out of the lid. Not the best design: The 2nd of 3 was ruined when we brought it to the beach & a few granules of sand got btw. the flip lid and lid, scratching lines in the material & rendering it difficult to open."
2,Bottle is cute....not durable...not for toddlers,I got this bottle because it was free of BPA plastic...thats good for our kids...BUT this bottle spills...and my son dropped it on the concrete...and it broke...with a hole and a huge crack...so durable it is not...
2,Love till it breaks!,Was on my second one with my now four year old. But my one year old loved it two and managed to break them both with a simple drop to hardwood floors :( I'll be looking for something else unfortunately.
2,very cute but not durable,"Got one of these as a present and loved it. my toddler liked using it as well. I liked how it was fairly easy to clean, a bigger size bottle and it had the oz. measurements on the side. However, he dropped it from his high chair to our hardwood floor and it cracked and started leaking. I see other toddlers dropping their sippy cups everywhere and theirs don't seem to break. I guess the plastic on this cup isn't as strong which is unfortunate because toddlers often drop things and throw things on the floor. Would've liked to have used this for years but only used it for 2 months."
2,leaky but loved by toddler,"Our toddler has enjoyed using these bottles since she was a year old. We've owned two over the last 7 months.Pros: Very easy for toddlers to hold, sip from, and open and close. Semi-transparent bottles make it easy to see how much liquid remains.Cons: Bottles leak from the straw when you take it out of the fridge and the pressure equalizes. Also leak from around the threads even when cap and valve are secured. The open/close tabs have chipped off of both bottles from having been dropped onto hardwood and tile floors. The straws, apparently great teethers, need replacing every one or two months. The decorations on the bottle wear away after a few washes (we handwash the bottles). Have I mentioned these bottles leak?"
2,A FATHER-SON CONFLICT,"We think that the story wants to show the problems between father and son, because of different attitudes and religion. Although it shows the problems of immigrants. At the beginning, the is boring but later it gets interesting. We think that the story is truthful and comprehensible, but we're not interested in this story."
2,A conflict which exists all over the world,"I don't like the story so much, because social stories are not my taste, a little bit action must be. But save for my personal taste the story isn't so bad. It's a theme which exists all over the world. It's an easy-to-understand story. So if you want to read a short and interestering story, i can prefer it to you."
1,A boring short story,"I find the story boring. The theme isn't interesting for young people. I can identify me with the father-son conflikt, but the reasons why the problems are become i don't understand. The religion than problem between father and son i know,but a so intolerant attitude i don't understand."
4,Hip Hop del bueno,"Spanish hip hop with strong lirics and execent hip hop wave ,the lider voice is fast but with total control on the bases. buen hip hop en español."
4,"Good book, but not a lot detail","If you are a newbie to 3ds max then this would be a good book for you. I am on chapter 7 of this book and am finding a small fraction of difficulty. This book doesn't get into as much detail as I would have preferred it to. One thing I didn't like was making this robot model. All it really is, is spheres and cylinders. But I guess it's just a newbie book. So let me just say that its not the best book in the world for max 4. Seriously my friends, if you want to start 3ds max 4, there are better books out there than this one. Overall, this book is an alright book to get a novice modeler up and going."
2,Would help if the booklet was printed correctly,"One problem is that the booklet that comes with the tape has several misprints because the printer could not all handle all characters the Czech Alphabet. I tried going to both the {websites} and publishing for an electronic versions of the booklet containing the correct characters. Neither web site exists. The tape seems nice, but I needed to make several handwritten corrections to the booklet. Good thing I already knew a little Czech otherwise I might have never caught this. Bottom line: You get what you pay for."
5,Another terrific score from James Horner,Having only recently acquired this score(from Amazon)and being a big James Horner fan I was thrilled to hear it is Horner at his best.A wonderful main theme is played in the first track followed by a series of beautiful pieces comprised mainly of piano solos performed by Horner himself.An absolute must for James Horner fans.
1,CUT to pieces!,"DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!I watched this years ago on VHS and was very impressed. Owning a multisystem DVD player, I figured I would go ahead and get the PAL version.The movie is not only severely cut, missing important scenes and lines, but whenever someone curses, the volume goes way down. Absolutely AWFUL!"
1,ug!,"would not watch this if I could. My son bought it, but could not watch it. Not the right format."
1,Cut version loses all impact,"I saw the original version years ago on VHS. I was hoping to watch it again on DVD. The heart of this movie was cut out along with various scenes, including part of his childhood memory."
3,I don't think so....,"Well, yeah, there are some tense moments, but it's just not as good as Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. And nobody comes close to Michael Rooker's performance, no matter how good they are -- and this guy's pretty good. All-in-all a worthy effort but Henry still leads. Plus, this is a PAL disk, so most people aren't going to be able to see it anyway."
2,Thin Metaphor,"Raines uses the metaphor of hooking and losing a large fish to describe his career; the surprise of getting a job that was beyond his expectations (hooking the fish), the long tedious years of work (fighting the fish), and his unexpected firing (losing the fish). Raines' first fishing book outlined his political agenda. In his second book, he explains his management oversight that resulted in his dismissal. I prefer fishing literature that makes an environmental point, an ethical fishing point, or is just an entertaining story. I am finished buying Raines' books because I do not care to spend my entertainment money to listen to his personal agenda. Raines' books are editoral pages thinly wrapped in fish."
3,Not bad,"Not bad , but not as memorable as ""Flyfishing Through The Mid-life Crisis ."" I didn't have the connection with this that I had with the previous book . Maybe if I had the money to hop jets , and fish Christmas Island , Russia , and other exotic destinations , or if I lived in Manhattan and could hop in a car and drive to my mountain get away home , I would feel different about it . I've actually spent time on the Rapidan , and seen camp Hoover , a couple of times . Also , it would have been better if Howell narrated this audiobook himself , like he did the previous book . There are memorable characters , life lessons , and some good insight reguarding fly fishers , and human nature in general though . I did enjoy it ."
1,The One That Bored Me To Death,"This book is another tome from the guy who offered insight into how to fish through a mid-life crisis. When I saw the book's cover, I thought this would be a work in which the author shared with the reader how fly-fishing allowed him to wade through a difficult time of professional disaster. I was very disappointed. What I was treated to instead was a random series of vignettes woven around fishing and the author's professional development. Neither one was very informative. The were superficial and vapid. The author also takes the perspective of someone who is very elevated from the day to day struggles of most Americans. In addition to this, he is always name dropping more well known fly-fishers. This is too pretentious to allow the writing to be enjoyable. In summation, I would avoid this book unless I was one of the individuals who likes to engage in the pursuits of the common folk."
2,Two Books In One,"If you're looking for a journalism memoir, you've come to the wrong place, really. You'll have to wade through much tedium about fishing, through which Raines tries to come to epiphanies about life and loss. I found myself flipping through about 85 percent of the book to get to what I thought were the good parts: his recollections of how Jayson Blair wrecked his NYT career. Raines paints himself as a saviour of what he thought was a hidebound newspaper. There may always be a debate about what he really achieved. He should have stuck to either fishing or journalism to make this book work. One wonders if something this muddled could ever make it past the gatekeepers at the evolving Times of today."
2,"Too much politics, too little fishing","Author is a major liberal, and there is way too much politics and way too little fishing. Not a bad book, but certainly not a good book..."
5,Great Grilltop Pan,"This grilltop pan was used for grilling vegetables. It's large enough that it holds veggies for eight. It'll also be used for kabobs, shrimp and fish. The shape with the slight angle to the front makes it easy to stir and turn food over. It keeps the food from dropping through the grill top."
4,"Loud, But Fun!","My 19 month old loves this toy. My best friend's 13 month old loves this toy. I do have a couple problems with this toy. It does not have a volume switch and it is pretty loud. Also, I like my daughter to use it in the identification mode, but it is so easy for her to switch modes, I can't keep it on her level. She loves the song! On the plus side, it is very educational and fun for the kids. It also turns off on its own when she just drops it on the floor and walks off, which I like. Overall, I would recommend this toy!"
2,"Entertaining, but loud.","My daughter enjoys playing with this toy, and treats it like a phone (as it resembles a cell phone). She likes pushing the buttons and listening to the music, but she holds it up to her ear while it's playing music. The problem with this is that it is very loud, and there is no sound adjustment. It's so loud you can hear it rather well from upstairs. It's a good idea, especially with the whole bilingual education it provides, but I wish it had a volumn adjustment so it wouldn't cause any negative effects on her ears. I wouldn't advise this toy for kids under 3 who don't understand not having loud objects so close to their ears."
2,Chakra Meditation,"The narrator goes through the seven chakras with a ""christian"" meditation for each. Her voice is not very soothing."
4,good album but too many,they have too many of the best. this album is ok but the only drawback is the dvd is in region 0. So if your dvd player can only play region 1 you are screw. I recommend en directo las primeras ventas de 1 julio 2003 dvd of los hombres g. Badass concert in Madrid.
4,Good Devo for Teens,"I've been using this devo book for a few months now. The entries are short but have good messages. They all come with a verse and a quote (I love the quotes!). For a busy teen this is a great devo because the entries are short and the bible verse is written right in it so you don't have to pull out your bible and look it up. My reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes the verses don't seem to go with the entry, but overall this is a good devo book for teens."
2,Not what I consider timber framing.,This book is about timber framing with nuts and bolts and metal plates - not carved joints.Not what I wanted. Nor does this technique interest me.Maybe it should be called Timber Framing for Those of Us Who Don't See the Beauty in Wooden Joints.
3,Some great nuggets of info but.......,"Some great nuggets of info but fails to deliver the ""How-to"" that the title hints at. I was dissappointed and am now looking for a ""cookbook"" or ""how-to"" style book.I can not recommend this book."
3,Offensive to real Timber Frames and the timber wrights that build them!,"I find most of the books by Rob, an interesting read, but would not recommend this one if you want to learn real timber framing. I am a traditional timber wright and have been part of countless timber frames. This book has nothing at all to do with traditional timber framing, and in many ways, is an affront to the art and craft of this most noble of building methods. I am certain that Rob's intent of the book is to add folks in building with large timbers, but if you take from the title that this is about traditional timber framing, you will be disappointed. I personally would, if you are interested, find a book on the actual craft. This book is more about using metal fasteners to build rustic large timber structures."
4,Does the job but,Pricey for some stamped sheet metal. But recommend replacing ancillary brake hardware as a good practice that is often neglected.
5,"Simply the Best, better then all the rest!",well ever since lauren vision came into my life. my life has completey changed i have learened the true meaning of life. and remember you might think your to fat or maybe your to tall you might think your different not popular at all dont diss yourself your beutiful to me just the way you are unconditionly dont diss yourself your beutiful.
1,TaxCut will not print with HP printers,"This is a serious bug. TaxCut will not print to HP printers, there is no work around and there is no patch available and no word on when or if one will be available. Customer Service is no help. Not only do they not know anything about Macs, but they have no solution either. The online help is similarly worthless. This version should have never gone out the door this way. I would NOT recommend buying it until the bugs are fixed; by that time you could do your return by hand and have a rebate."
3,Tax Cut,"After years of doing my returns by hand I decided to break down this year and buy a tax package. I'd really love to give this product 5 stars, but I couldn't print my return (HP printer) and emails to customer service were unanswered. I e-filed which made printing less of a concern, but obviously I'd like to have a copy for my files.Downloading updates, the state return and e-filing went without a hitch.I notice from other reviews that there might be a patch available for the printing problem. We'll see."
2,Current ver 1.1 will not print (as of 16-Feb-02),"The program is certainly priced better than TurboTax and the rebates offered to PC users are also offered to Mac users. It seems easy to use and was problem free up until it was time to print. The current version 1.1 will not even print the blank 1040 test page much less a completed return! I have combed the online help pages and have not found anything useful. Considering that the blank test page won't print, I can only assume that H&R Block did not perform sufficent testing before release. I have sent an e-form question to Tech Support describing the problem and my system in detail. I hope to hear back within 48 hours. My system is an iMac DV 400/320MB OS 9.2.1 with an HP 960c printer."
2,Faded Fast,"I liked this cover at first, but then it quickly started to fade so now it is green instead of brown. I would buy another one if the company guaranteed that it would not fade."
3,Not the Best,"I found the controller to fit in my hands well, but the use of the controls is so-so. The D- pad is a little ""mushy"" and will sometimes make you make errors. But the overall setup of the controller was good, and the USB is nice, but if I could change my controller I would go for the original one."
2,Horrible D-pad....,The D-pad is very unaccurate and a pain to use.I found it easyer to use the mouse and arrows.Using the floating d pad makes ur thumb hurt after 1 minute...otherwise the rest of this controller is good.
5,Awesome!,"This is a great product. It fits well in your hands, and is well designed. It's perfect for the average gamer looking for some excitment."
4,A Good Starting Point,"For anyone in the construction management field, this text is a well-known reference. Nothing can replace your own firm's historical productivity data and quotes from subcontractors and suppliers, but RS Means can give you a good idea of where an estimate begins. It is a great tool for architects and owners to calculate preliminary cost estimates for a wide range of products."
5,perfect!,we received the item very quickly! and are satisfied with the quality of the product. Will show with this vendor again!
4,The Face - Jesus in Art 2001,This is an interesting look at Jesus through the eyes of many cultures and religions. It is informative and enlightning. Anyone who believes in Jesus should own this film. Like Jesus this film will stand the test of time.
5,THE FACE,"This video has been a blessing-- I orginally viewed it during the Easter Season. It is a beautifully written, filmed and narrated work of art in it's own right. A reverend but wholly joyful testamant to the love and awe that man has tried to offer back to God in his desire to portray Jesus, the Christ in each of their own times. It was compelling to see how artists at each moment in time sought to picture the Christ for their audiences-and more --how they speak to us even now. It was fascinating to see how each time frame sought to answer Jesus' question to us --""Who do you say I am?"""
2,Tuning,"Th first problems I noticed was that when I tried to tune it would become out of tune pretty fast. The bow was a bad quality , it shed all the horse hair in less than a year of using it. The sounding was okay comparing to price , but it is not one you would want to purchase if you are a beginner or wanting to revive a old hobby. Hope this helps!"
4,Frommer's Belgium Helper,Very well writen guide! This little book is packed with information and maps which proved very helpful on my recent trip to Brussels and Bruges.
3,"A good history of the life of black women in Orangeburg, S.C","This book is full of historical facts and pictures dating back in the early 1940's, that take place in South Carolina. This book was well researched and tastefully portrays the lifestyles of the different classes of African-American women."
1,Fun but confussing,I was very excited about the game. However the directions where not clear. There was no who goes first and there where miss prints in the scripts that we had to read.Would have been more fum with a little more guidance.
4,My first murder party,"It was my first mystery dinner party -- and the guests were from our mystery book club. I really liked it, but it would have been better with some eduation (about when to ad lib, show the evidence around, etc). We had fun and even I (very shy) dressed up and got into character. Can't wait to buy another -- but will do a little more preparation."
3,Luau fun,"It was easy for the girls to dress up for their character. It was fun, but it lasted less than an hour. Not worth spending $32.00. Also, only 6 people really had parts, the extra characters roles were not much fun."
3,Fun but Forgettable,I've played a few of these games and I would say this is the most forgettable one I've played. The characters I can't recall now.
3,Fun fun fun,This dinner party game was alot of fun and my guests certainly got into character and had a ball. Some cheated and read another's book early but we all still had lots of laughs. I made up my own menu and we were all in costume.
4,It was a blast,"We did this for our church singles group. I went through each script and made a few changes to make it a little more appropriate for this group, but other than that, it was easy, fun and everyone had a great time."
4,Mystery Game,Game was in excellent shape when it arrived however it seemed to be too difficult to really enjoy
3,Who Would Have Guessed!!!!,I housed this at my birthday party...it was fun and all....dont get me wroung....but by the end of the story line when you had to guess who was the murder....every single character had a reason to commit the crime....it was impossible to guess....it was basically a luck game.....there was not deatil that you had to really lisen for to figure out teh murder....i wish it was a little easier....in my group of 10 people and like four others not playing not one person got correct person....it was fun tough i think the best part was dressing up like differeent people....and teh cd was a very nice touch...
3,Not for 6-8 players!,"I LOVE murder mysteries, but this listing needs to be updated to reflect that the game is for 8 players now, not 6-8.I have done several murder mysteries from this company before, and they used to have 6 main characters and 2 optional. The 2 optional characters were always really lame, so I'm guessing the makers responded to customer feedback and revised their games to integrate all 8 players. I think that's WONDERFUL!That said, I bought this game to play with 6 people, based on the product description. I know I'll end up using this one eventually, so I didn't return it, but it was frustrating to get the package and find out it was useless for my upcoming party. I ended up buying and downloading a party for 6 online."
4,ONLY FOR SIX,"This was a fun play to do on our snowy night. You can have a blast decorating in the luau theme. I must say I was really disappointed in the parts for the 2 extra guests. I knew they wouldn't be suspects, but I wasn't aware they didn't even have any lines! If you do this, keep it to six. I also enjoyed A Taste of Wine and Murder much more than this one. The kit did include everything and I liked the idea of placecards for the characters at the dinner table. You can also order some Chinese Food - we did the sweet & sour - which seemed to have the luau theme in case you don't want to cook."
3,"F.Y.I. - Same movie as ""Horror Castle""!!!","""The Virgin Of Nuremerg"", a.k.a. ""Horror Castle"". The latter version can be had for almost $10 less. I've never had the chance to compare quality between them but I own the ""Virgin"" release and it looks great ~"
2,Frogger's just not what it used to be :(,"I played Frogger as a kid on the Atari (I know, I'm ancient) and it was one of my favorite games. Even though graphically speaking this game is a step up from Atari's Frogger, the game is very frustrating to play. I don't think I could call it ""fun"". Story Mode is too long and complicated, and Challenge Mode is okay but you only get two lives! And trust me it takes about two seconds to use them both up, then you have to start all over. My kids hate this game but I play it occasionally when I'm feeling nostalgic. Overall I would not buy it again."
5,Back to the Beauty,"This CD is more like Sara's earlier music. It is strong in simplicity. The lyrics are inspiring and the voice, as always, is pure. This is one of the best Christian recordings of 2005."
5,Wonderful music!,"I love all of Sara Groves cd's, but this one is definately one of her best. Every song is excellent! ""Add to the Beauty"" is more in the style of her first cd's. One thing I really like about her music is that she has deep, thought provoking lyrics. Her voice is very mellow as well. Simply beautiful! I wholeheartely give this 5 stars!"
4,Good to Use for those dealing with difficult times.,This was recommend to me to use in a Ministry I am involved with in my church. The songs are of great comfort to those going thru hard times. It reminds them of God's love and that everything will be alright.
5,This is a must own CD,"""Add to the Beauty"" is such a great album -- great songs and a shockingly great sound. This honestly is one of the best SOUNDING albums I have ever heard. You feel as though you are right there in the studio with Sara. Buy it!"
1,WARNING: DO NOT USE FOR COMPATIBILITY,"This book is GREAT if all you're looking for is a book on doing coding for Internet Explorer. Practically EVERY example does NOT work in any version of Netscape. If you want to limit yourself to a great page in Internet Explorer, but leave out the HUGE faction of people who use Netscape, this book is for you. I feel ashamed that I wasted money on this book. I guess I should have paid more attention to the fact that it was a Microsoft Press book. I wouldn't think they would discriminate THIS badly, but suckerpunches are what Microsoft seem to be about!"
1,Not a good reference,"There are better books available that show better (real case) examples than this. Check out;Elements of Web Design : The Designer's Guide to a New Medium -- Darcy Dinucci, et al; PaperbackCreating Killer Web Sites, Second Edition -- David S. Siegel, David Seigel; Paperback"
5,Absolutely Great Resource to spice up your sites!,"I bought this book at the same time as 2 others and found it very easy to read, search and use. I was able to modify many of his scripts to suit my own sites and impress my HTML programming class! I will buy the next one if Jim does another like this one!"
2,Glad I didn't pay full price,"At first I thought this was going to be a book that was going to be a page turner. The synopsis on the back caught my attention, but there were so many loose ends, I kept back tracking to see if I had pages stuck together. She started weaving stories that never came together, and she could have delved deeper in the magical side of the story, since it was so heavily lauded on the back. Elissa started out as a likeable, steadfast, courageous young woman thrust into a terrible situation, and what happened at the end was infuriating. It was like the author decided to end the book there and be done with it, throwing away all that Elissa had fought so hard for. The book passed the time, but I'm glad I only paid 1.35 for it."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","The heroine of this novel is intended to be atypical in fantasy novels: a strong, heroic woman, who nonetheless is very feminine. Unfortunately, she's just too shallow and full of too many contradictions to be believable. She's a determined woman who learns to wield a sword -- but she cries herself to sleep at night, for a different reason every night. She was in love with her dead husband -- but she's lusting after his best friend about a month after he's dead. She's full of all these good ideas -- but she never thinks them up, they just come to her. The characterization in this novel was so poor that I did not care about any of the characters, even by the end."
1,Choppy story with a breath stealing ending...,"I was prepared to love this book, the premise was a fine one, it promised a decent story. I was miserably let down, the characters did nothing to endear themselves to me and the ending was so abrupt I questioned whether or not there were pages missing. I will chock this poor storytelling to an inept editor and maybe look over something else by the author but I was very disappointed with the Winter Queen."
2,OUT OF DATE,"While this book still has value, it is a crime that it is still being sold given that video technology has expanded so rapidly...no doubt, no one can keep up, but while this is an exceptional book for 94 through say, 98...it is way behind now...you'd be far better off buying a more uptodate manual and hopefully someone will update this one...avoid paying anything for this other than at a garage sale..."
5,King Size Pillow Cases,We had just purchased new king size pillows and our current pillow cases did not fit properly. The Wrinkle Guard King Pillowcase Pair fits beautifully and looks beautiful throughout the week. The taupe color is especially rich looking. We are very pleased.
3,Wes,"I like the sound of the cd and the # of tunes/dollar spent ratio, but it does not have enough guitar-oriented stuff on it. It's overwhelmed with jazzy organ tunes, which is cool, but I want more Wes next time."
4,Wordless Wonder,"This book has been a charmer for an entire childhood in our home. With wordless books, young readers may spend a few moments solving the story line and enjoying its presentation. Readers who pick up Mouse Around, whether young or old, typically linger over each page as they follow the adventures of one mouse who has fallen out of the nest. The intricacies of the plot as it twists and turns pulls the reader in with delight and its happy ending completes this appealing circular tale."
3,"A good album, but not close to greatness","While this album is listenable and enjoyable, there aren't any songs here that rank among Midnight Oil's best, and the music doesn't have quite the intensity of old. Singer Peter Garrett doesn't really sound like he's into it, and while many of the songs sound like they would rock out when played live, there's something missing in the recording. The highlights are ""Underwater"", ""E-Beat"", and ""Surf's Up Tonight"". The slow songs are a mixed bag: ""Home"", with guest Emmylou Harris, is good, while ""One Too Many Times"" dives into country and ""In the Rain"" is just strange, with its amplified ukulele and synthesizer."
5,Hands down the best Midnight Oil album.,"To whom it may concern,If you've reached my review, then thank you! This is a great album! I cannot stop listening to this disc, and that's since Oct. of '96! The musicianship is stellar, the songs amazing! If you say you like rock, then get this album! You will not be let down."
4,"Don't Expect the Oils Sound, But Try It Anyway","This album was recorded in a Sydney building using low-tech equipment (one can even occasionally hear hear passing traffic in the background), and the sound is decidedly different form earlier Oils efforts...much more basic, stripped-down, groove-oriented rock. But the effect is very satisfying, if one doesn't expect the ""classic"" Oils sound. ""Underwater"" is one of their very best tunes, period.The last decade has seen the Oils grow more and more disaffected with the music industry in general; I believe that ""Breathe"" was an intentional slap at Sony, designed to give the label exactly what it didn't want...a low key collection of garage band tunes...when Sony was looking for another ""Diesel and Dust"" (the best part, though, is that ""Breathe"" is actually a wonderful - though noncommercial - album).Give it a try, but leave your preconceived notions at the door."
2,"A sorry effort, bordering on an insult","Listening to Breathe, I get the feeling that the Oils were pissed off with Sony, the process of making music or both when they went into the studio. The songs sound tired and simultaneously overproduced. A real disservice to their fans. Blue Sky Mine was really their last solid album; perhaps after that, success jaded the Oils."
3,A bit uneven,"A disappointment. There are some good songs here, and then there are some songs that sound like Midnight Oil was trying to drop their classic sound in favor of some contrived, Seattle-soundalike, grunge thing. Overall this is okay but does not even compare to the Oils' best work, nor is it a good album to start with. It's for completists, mainly."
2,The mirror was dirty,When I received this cd I didn't know if it would even play the surface looked so back. It does play so that is good.
4,A Sweet and Heartfelt Tribute to the Cinema of Old,"A touching and relaxing soundtrack with just the right elements. Hamlisch is in top form here. From the exciting brass segments and string passages to the lush piano jazz and quirky harmonica themes... this is a ""must have"" for relaxation music lovers.(4 stars instead of 5 because of the short length.)"
3,The beautiful soundtrack of a beautiful movie from Barbra!,"This soundtrack contains lovely themes by Marvin Hamlisch and Barbra Streisand and it is very lush, as expected. Barbra needed to record only two songs for this release, but they are so good they are enough. Her hit duet with Bryan Adams is a great love ballad and the other song ''All Of My Life'' has similar music with a different lyric by Alan & Marilyn Bergman (not a surprising phenomenon). The music score is very sentimental, but because of the fact that it's a little repetitive, it would come to be boring, if there wasn't the Richard Marx recording somewhere between. It also has a theme from David Sanborn and the closing of Luciano Pavarotti's classic ''Nessun Dorma''. For those who adore Barbra Streisand or music scores or both, highly recommended."
1,Too monotonous,Unfortunately I was disappointed in this CD as I did not remember that there were practically no lyrics to any of the music that was played throughout the movie.
4,Music that compliments the film!,"This is a great soundtrack! I found the music quite catching and Barbra's performance memorable. Even Richard Marx does well! For those who like listening to sountrack music, this is a relaxing, easy listening cd. It is as pleasant as the film. I highly recomend it even to non-Streisand fans."
1,Fraudulent,"Imagine buying this CD after seeing ""The Mirror has Two Faces"" fully expecting the SOUNDTRACK music to the movie, and reading overall great reviews on Amazon. Imagine the shock of receiving the CD and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - The remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse. Perhaps Barbara, with her tremendous unlimited wealth, felt she would be giving away a ""free album"" to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film. Shameless misrepresentation."
4,not bad at all,"Shipped quick, good quality disc. I would recomend it. Too bad there is not enough of Barbra's voice, but the music is good."
2,"Cut content, Clumsy translation.","While the book is an exceptional print and much of the story is consistent with previous editions, there are two jarring details that keep this from being a ""must buy""Firstly, scenes of ""adult content"" that are very important to the development of characters and of the universe have been cut from this edition. It's not a lot of content that is missing, but the edit interrupts the flow of the story and is heartbreaking for lovers of the original Japanese version.Secondly, in tandem with the scenes removed, some dialogue has been rewritten/retranslated to make up for the cut content and to soften the universe as a whole. Again, for dedicated fans of Shirow Masamune this hurts the feel and tone of the book overall."
4,ghost rocks,just love the art work and thoughtfull story line. if the future is any thing like this I need a better firewall lol
1,Censored edition,"Unfortunately, Kodansha has decided to censor this release of Ghost in the Shell by changing artwork and removing entire scenes. If you would like to read the series in it's unedited entirety, you would be best tracking down Dark Horse's older 2005 release.For more discussion on this books edits, you can read about it on page 25 of the AnimeOnDVD forum's ""Edited Manga List"" thread."
4,"Its a high class manga, but it needs more variation.","Ghost in the shell is a very high quality manga with a few flaws. It's style is superb and the characters are varied, but its not the funniest book in the world(except for the fuchicomas!)and it can be a little complex at times. It's action packed and well worth a read if you like manga, although i suggest you buy the video instead. Then buy the book if you like it."
4,Major Kusanagi is gunning for you...,"The year: 2029. The situation: Government Cyber-brainwashing facility out of hand. Solution: Major Kusanagi.The year: 2029. The situation: Terrorist hunting to kill Major Kusanagi. Solution: Major Kusanagi herself.Situation: Illegal cyborg production involves copying of children's minds. Solution: Major Kusanagi.Major Kusanagi is a anti-terrorist agent with a twist, she's a Ghost in the Shell. Fending off government conspiracies, terrorist vendettas and garbagemen, Kusanagi is a female cyborg to be reckoned with.A tough read, it will take some readers twice to form any idea of continuity. Ghost in the Shell is tightly woven, and definately not a casual coffeetable book. Shirow's attention to detail and actually exciting art will make you come away with an appreciation for his work, it is immaculate."
5,Highly Recommended Sci-Fi Action!,"Masamune Shirow is the greatest. One of the ways I can back my opinion up is with Ghost In The Shell. This book is much like the anime, but has more detail. If you like the anime get the book, and if you like the book get the anime! Great work Shirow, keep it up!^_^"
5,George Drury/Trains/Switzerland = The Best,"I recently had the opportuity to travel to Switzerland on business. Before my date of departure, I purchased a copy of The Railfan Guide to Switzerland by George Drury, to get an idea of what type of train trips I could fit into the limited free time I would have. While reading the book, I was pleased that in addition to the wealth of train information it contained, it also included other advice and information that a traveler to Switzerland would need to know. Although this book is definitely intended to be a major reference source for the rail enthusiast such as myself, I think it is also a good guide for the international traveler that wants to travel within Switzerland. Major cities, currencies, dining tips, handy german phrases, tourist railroads and local attractions are all covered in the book. The information it contained, enabled me to get the most out of my limited time in Switzerland."
4,not enough Elmo,"There is more Elmo on this than Platinum TOO, but Best of Elmo is still the best cd for kids who will only listen to the little red 3 year old.My 21 month insists that I forward the cd only to those songs that Elmo is on.Otherwise, this is a fun group of songs for those children who like the whole gang."
4,Excellent Sesame Street Compilation,"Only disappointmentis that it doesn't have more signature Sesame Street songs on it... like ""I love trash..."" ""Rubber Duckie""... Buy it though. It's quite clever!"
4,Great Variety of Music,"The CD contains a little bit of everything, but all songs familiar to my daughter."
2,Cushions Rot,"After assembling, the furniture looked great. Unfortunately, within days after first use the cushions were dirty and difficult to clean (unlike other cushions I have had outside). Then within another week or so, the cushions got extremely bad mildew and needed to be tossed. Now I need to decide whether or not to buy cushions every year and worry about moving them to storage whenever they are not in use. I would not recommend you buy this furniture unless you live somewhere extremely dry. Very disappointed."
3,Great Style -however fabric so-so,"Loved the look and price of this product. However, after one use and leaving it out in the yard, the fabric got stained from leaves that fell upon it. It surely is not like the sunbrella products that I have used in the past."
1,Cushions get dirty VERY easily,"The cushions in this set are well made, but dirty very easily. We scotchguarded them when we received the set and still had problems. Finally I removed all the covers and stained them - better than the dirty color they were becoming. The stain has faded and they look terrible now. The size is an unusual size, so the only place to buy new cushions is from the same manufacturer and they are VERY expensive. I would not buy this set again."
2,below expectations,"Way below expectations:The package has wrong audio cord...although it says for ipaq, the cor supplied was for treo, got it returned and exchanged, but same problem.Ok so i bought a seperate cord...now 2 months down and the sliding sides dont click and stay. so i cannot keep the ipaq on the mount since there is not grip holding it from the side.over all ......"
5,love it,"Adjustable mount can go anywhere. The speaker really makes using the Ipaq easy while driving. (We turn it up less than halfway.) The only potential negative is that the cord to the power source could be a little longer, but it works fine."
3,A really great half a novel,"This thing really crackles along for a while and I was expecting great things, but then the dialogue goes flat, the characters thin out and, blah.It's still preeeetty good, but just."
5,An entertaining account of time travel,"Dr. Pickover has written an entertaining account of time travel. The book may be enjoyed by a scientist or an ordinary reader. In keeping with his unique thought process Pickover has appended a section of comments provided by friends, in effect a set of book reviews. One comment - ""The relativistic metric is hyperbolic"" can only be appreciated by a physicist. Pickover is indeed a world-class science writer. Any of his books is worth reading. It is a surprise that he did not make himself a subject of his book titled ""Strange Brains and Genius; The Secret Lives of Eccentric Scientists and Madmen""."
4,Clear presentation of consequences of time-as-we-know-it,"One-stop shopping for a particularly clear and entertaining description of time as seen from the scientific viewpoint (philosophy has its own collection of work on ""what is time?"").The chapter ""The brain's time machine"" is especially interesting... time DOES bend your mind."
4,Entertaining physics lessons - what a concept!,"My first reading of Pickover's work, this book was both enjoyable and educational. Pickover presents a refreshing look at the physics and philosophy of time and space travel."
2,Good if You Like Novels,"Although I am fascinated by time travel and its physical reality, I just could not continue reading this book. The material is very good, but the problem is that the author intermingled with the subject a novel that is so dull. At first I tried to enjoy the accompanying novel, then I started skipping the story to the real subject, but finally I got tired and I stopped.I just wish that the author had concentrated on the time travel subject and did not accompany a boring novel with it.Don't buy this book unless you greatly enjoy reading novels."
4,Good album - needs more classics,"This album has some GREAT timeless moments - The Very Thought of you, Come Rain or Come Shine, Fly me to the Moon just to mention a few.But then u get a few corny dated 1950s songs which noone except people from that era remember or like. If u can get the good tunes on other CDs, skip this one. But if it's on sale, it's a good deal."
4,old but nice,old CD but nice music.. the quality are okold CD but nice music.. the quality are okold CD but nice music.. the quality are ok
3,Perhaps not the best place to start,"Like the other reviewer, I look forward to Baaba Maal's new releases, but I found this particular one was relatively disappointing. I believe most if not all of the songs here, are found on other albums, and without so much of the spirit and energy that really makes Baaba Maal's music come alive. This album sort of feels like a Lawrence Welk-icized version of some of his otherwise best songs - the drums sound muted, and keyboards replace some of the more exotic stringed instuments... man, even the horns sound synthesized and dull.Go for ""Djam Leelii"" if you'd like to listen to a more meditative and gorgeous Baaba Maal record, listen to ""Firin in Fouta"" for a danceable and funky party disc, or get ""Nomad Soul"" for a refined and polished fusion/collaboration listen. I think they released ""Jombaajo"" for us purists who automatically buy anything with his name on it. :)"
5,Very Informative and Inspirational,"I have used both of Laurie Bouke's books to learn more about the process of Elimination Communication (ie: Potty Whispering, Infant Potty Training, Natural Infant Hygeine) and have loved them. This DVD is just as great. When I watched it, I was in process of succesfully ""EC-ing"" my 9 month old. The video was very validating and entertaining. If you're a sceptic, or if you're a veteran ""EC-er"", I highly reccomend this DVD. Check it out!"
3,"Great Idea, But Slow DVD","This DVD has good information in it, but it is extremely slow to watch. I'm sad to say that as much as I am interested in the subject, I still have not finished watching it, and I've tried at least twice. I've read most of her book though, Infant Potty Basics, and the concept makes a lot of sense. Whereas many books or DVD's seem to lack the proof of research or studies, it's obvious that this author has gone out of her way to study this practice around the world. I would give the idea 5 stars, but the video just became too boring, hence 3 stars."
3,Confused,"I gave this a neutral review, only because I bought it for a completely different purpose than what the DVD is about. I wanted to start potty training my child before the age of two and this really only goes through infant potty training. I guess when I heard about the ""potty whisperer"", I assumed it would pertain to all ages, but it doesn't. Even though I bought this DVD in error, I still watched it. If I was wanting to do this when my child was an infant, I still don't think it was a great instructional DVD. It went through more scenes of showing a mother/father holding their baby to pee or poop....and discussing why it can be done, but I'm just not sure the methodology is great. Anyway, bottom line........read the insert on this!"
3,Problems playing in some DVD players,"The DVD is very informative, but I couldn't play parts of it on one of my DVD players."
5,How to save time and money.,"This product will save you money, time, and is a quick fix. I do not play my 360 that offen and my batteries would be dead within 1 to 2 weeks in my wireless controlers. Now After I got the rechargeable battery backs and charger there is no more going to the store for batterys. When you first get it it will be in the price range of 20 to 30 dollars but it is worth it in the long run."
1,Pink's Dead On Arrival,My wife ordered one of these pink rechargeable packs for our Xbox 360 controller. We already have the Play-and-Charge kit for two white battery packs that work perfect and we attempted to use it to charge the pink one. It would not charge at all as it would read as a full charge on the play-and-charge cable. Once the cable was removed the controller would shut down in a mater of seconds.We reported this to Amazon and they sent another pink battery pack to replace it. The new one performed just as well. Did not hold a charge. We sent it back as well and received a refund.I believe the pink batteries may be just a bad batch or they are too old to work properly anymore. They were initially made for the Pink Wireless Controller released back in October of 2007 and are now out of print. It's possible that laying dormant for so long that they don't work anymore.
1,Garbage,Battery did not last more than 5 seconds after a long attempt at charging before use. Absolute crap. Should have listened to other reviewers. How do I get my money back???
1,They don't hold a charge more than a few hours.,"Ordered these, even though they are pink, because I didn't trust the off-brand battery packs. They came perfectly packaged and pretty quick delivery, but they just don't hold a charge, and it really sucks to be playing COD (or any other game), and your controller dies suddenly. Sad..."
1,DO NOT BUY - BEWARE,"I wish I had read the reviews BEFORE I purchased... Didn't work at all, didn't even charge at all. The only time it does anything is when the Charge and Play is plugged into the Xbox I can use it while its plugged in but then whats the use of a wireless controller?. Waste of my money. Hope my review will save someone else."
2,Defective battery,"Unable to charge the battery with charging cable or charging station. Another standard black battery was bought at the same time, and it had no issues. Battery was defective and returned.I would have contacted Dealer directly to discuss, but couldnt locate that ability in the system. I would prefer not to write a negative review if at all possible."
1,"Doesn't work, might start a fire","I ordered a pink. At $5 how could I go wrong? Well you know what they say about too good to be true. the battery holds about an hour of charge. It also charges really slow (about 8 hours) and gets crazy hot when it's charging, so hot that I'm concerned that it might start a fire."
3,"OK, but hoping it gets better.","Just got the battery yesterday, charged it up to full and it died shortly after, charged it again, and it dies again. The directions that came with it said it may take several charging cycles to get back to normal after being left alone for a while. Knowing Microsoft stopped making these several years ago, buy at your own risk. I am hoping this will get better and update in about a week.Edit-Followed the directions and went through about 3 charging cycles with it dying quickly. Viola! Problem fixed itself, battery at full capacity, been playing past two days without charging and battery still full. Worth the money and a little patience, no technology is perfect."
5,No more AA's!!!,"Not having to swap out AA's all the time is a godsend for the XBOX 360. It's not as if the battery life is particularly bad, but there comes a time when batteries start to fail, and then you realize you have no replacements. Sometimes that might not be too big of a deal, but when you're in the middle of your game, trips to the 24-hour supermarket to buy batteries kind of kills the fun. With the rechargeable battery packs, those days are gone. Couple this with a Play and Charge Kit or a Charging Station, and you're set. This is a must-have if you own a 360."
5,Meh.,"Its a battery, rechargeable. Oh ya and it works great! I suggest replacing your dual AA packs with these."
5,nice replaces burning through batteries,this works and holds its charge for quite a while but you need to make sure that you get the play and charge wire to go along with it - one thing that is weird though if you have this charging while you are using it with the play and charge kit and then turn off the counsel the counsel really does not turn off and is still blowing hot air out of the back and drawing power. So I would unhook from the play and charge wire before turning off your counsel.
4,its all good,"my item arrived on time and works well. I'm very happy, my son is also is liking this item thank you"
1,Pink Batteries were Dead on Arrival,I ordered 4 of the pink batteries and 3 out of the 4 would not charge. I bought a new charger and same issue. The one battery that does charge doesn't hold it as long as my other battery packs. The number of 1 star reviews for this product should set off red flags that there is an issue with this inventory or this product.
1,Battery won't hold a charge,"I wish I'd read the other reviews before purchasing this battery. Evidently the blue and pink batteries can't hold a charge. I ended up returning this and purchasing theDreamgear DG360-279 Power Brick Rechargeable Battery Twin Pack for Xbox 360instead. My husband is very happy with the batteries, they actually hold a charge and for only $2, I got 2 batteries instead of 1."
1,blue black and pink batteries,I bought black blue and pink rechargable battery packs and they all fail to keep a charge after a little use...not worth the money ...better off using non chargable batteries...lkast longer....the white original pack seems to be the only one that works long enough and thats not for ever.....what happened to quality...????
1,Defective (Blue),"Ordered a blue one despite the bad reviews and it failed to hold a charge,the replacement did the same. Stay away."
1,Not worth the money,"Arrived within a week, DOA. Nothing more other than very disappointed... later ibrobbed the batteries out of it and put some different rechargeable in it and works like a charm now."
1,DON'T BUY THE PINK BATTERY,"I bought one for my wife, and apparently they are known to be defective. Don't be lulled in by the low price."
2,Die too quickly,"All 360 controller battery packs die too quickly I bought two of the pink ones because they were about $8 each as opposed to buying a black one which for some reason was $20. The charge lasted pretty long but after about 2 months it wouldn't hold a charge anymore and I was back to plugging my controller in. Honestly unless your TV is like 100ft away from you, just keep your controller plugged in and screw the wireless battery packs. Not worth it."
4,Pack seems to work,When I first got the pack it didn't function properly. After plugging and unplugging it a few times it finally began to charge. Seems to be working properly now.
3,Got two...one worked one was a dud.,I got two of these one for me and one for a friend as a gift because we were both having the same problem with our batteries holding a charge. The one I opened for me did not hold a charge even on the controller plugged into the console. When I plugged it to my charge station the red charge light never came on to show it was charging it was just black like no battery was there. My friends however worked great. So I can't rate it too low. Just average cause mine was a lemon.
2,Shot,"Not a bad deal for only 5 bucks. But the battery is shot will only stay charged for 20 min, maybe"
1,Utter crap from one of the suppliers.,"Bought two of the blue ones. Unboxed 'em, and didn't have a chance to use them. Threw out the packaging.Then tried them. They don't hold any charge; the controller immediately powers off as soon as it's unplugged.They're worse than no battery at all, mainly since I paid for these, and could have saved the money. What the hell?"
1,Don't Buy! They are all defective!,I ordered a blue battery and it was totally defective. I got a replacement from amazon and the replacement was defective too!!!Then I ordered another replacement and guess what happened?Amazon told me that all of the blue batteries are broken and they will give me a refund instead of a third replacement!!! I don't know why they sell them if they are all the same.?! To keep hold on some money for a while?
1,Stay Away from the Blue Pack,"I ordered the blue pack despite reading the bad reviews ... big mistake. They do not hold the charge, as soon as you unplug it from the charge wire, the controller shuts off.....DO NOT BUY!"
1,Junk,"For some reason I didn't read the reviews before purchasing this item, I will never make that mistake again. These are new old stock and because they are so old they no longer work. I plugged mine in for 8 hours immediately after receiving it and left it untouched that entire time. As soon as I removed the Play and Charge cable the controller went completely dead. This battery won't even hold a 1 second charge. Complete waste of money."
1,Never worked and I bought two,The battery never worked and I bought to different ones...both didn't hold a charge both didn't turn on my contrioller...I was highly upset but what can you do?
1,Pink Battery doesnt work!,"These pink batteries are freaking worthless. They won't charge up at all. They are totally dead. I got two of these worthless things for $18 total. I'm trying to get a refund. The people who sell these pink batteries must know about this. They are selling us defective products, probably hoping we won't try to get our money back."
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this battery pack after my first rechargeable battery lost its power completely. This (and the previous XBOX battery) lasted only a few months. Also the Plug-n-Charge kit wire does not work properly either. The battery, when it decides to charge, can hold a lot of gaming time on one charge. Save time and money...buy some Energizer or some other brand recharchable batteries, that way you could even use those on other household items e.g. flashlights, remote controls. Not a good investment."
1,Do not buy,"Do not buy the Pink batteries.They are old and will not charge, you will have to return them. The stock appears to be very old."
1,Dead,"My battery pack is now dead after 6 months. I bought the Play and Charge Kit and it's just another Microsoft product that has failed me. I'm on my 2nd Xbox 360 and 4th headset. Now I'm on my 2nd battery pack after I go and buy a new one. I can still play with the controller plugged in, but it does not recharge the battery anymore for wireless play."
1,Dead Rechargeables.,I have now purchased three rechargeable batteries. At first I was extremely happy with my rechargeable batteries. Plug them into your 360 and the next day they were recharged. I've had two of them for over a year and now they don't ever want to charge up. They only last for about two hours before they die. I can honestly say I will not purchase another set. This is pathetic a one year life on rechargeable batteries. I don't like the idea that I have to buy new rechargeable batteries every year.
1,CAN'T HOLD A CHARGE,I've had 2 rechargeable battery packs that wont hold a charge. These things are junk just like my 360. I honestly got about 5 charges from one battery pack before it failed. The other battery pack holds about 20 minutes for a full charge. My suggestion is to buy rechargeable batteries from any other company than Microsoft. This review may sound like I have a lot of hostility towards Microsoft. I've had about every problem that could ever go wrong with my 360 console since I purchased it. Microsoft denies all problems and tries to blame problems on the customer or the game manufacturer. If I could do it all over again I would have purchased a PS3.
1,Rubbish,These things die too quickly. The manufacturer also must be sending out defectives. One of mine only worked for a day before dying. Stick to the wired cables if you don't want to keep on buying batteries.
3,It works as expected,"Interesting how much less you can pay for a battery if you aren't picky about the color. The pink was even cheaper, but son was willing to pay more for the blue.The ratings are ""3"" because it is a battery, not a game."
4,Pink and pretty,"My wife needed a new battery pack for her 360 controller because the previous one had died. We were a little dismayed to find that Microsoft had stopped manufacturing the pink controllers and battery packs, but we were elated to find this NEW pack still on sale. It works great just like the old battery pack, just hope this one lasts longer!"
2,Repacks?,don't mind that they're pink as a battery's a battery. 1 of 3 was DOA and the other's don't live long; must be a reason they're cheap!
1,DO NOT BUY! DEFECTIVE BATTERIES!,"I bought one pink battery. I connected the battery to the charger and right away it said it was charged, I removed the charger and the battery went dead, I contacted the seller for this item and they sent me a replacement battery the SECOND battery did the exact same thing! none of these batteries work I bet! You guys will lose many customers with these products. THANKS FOR NOTHING now I have to have my controller connected to a cable all the time! >:("
3,battery,its good ..but doesnt seem to have as much playing time on a full charge like other batteries ive bought
2,Something is wrong with these batteries,"Bought 2 of these to replace the original NiMH's that came with my Play and Charge (white) that had outlived their useful lives. Got the blue ones because Amazon had them cheaper than the white ones. . . now I know why.Neither one of these blue ones charges properly on the Play and Charge kit; although they do charge they also get EXTREMELY hot, which puts them into a death spiral that convinces the 360 that they're never fully charged. Really disappointed in them since they're supposed to be OEM batteries."
3,Could have been better but you get what you pay for.,The battery works with my Xbox 360 controller but sometimes falls out of the controller while playing. I'm sure its because its not made by Microsoft.
2,50/50,"We ordered two battery packs. One appears to be working for the time being, but the other will not take a charge at all. Looking at the packaging these have been sitting on a shelf somewhere for a while and I'm now concerned the battery pack that is working will not for long."
1,Rechargeable Battery Blues,Never worked. Would not charge. I own several of these Xbox 360 Rechargeable battery packs in various colors. I am familiar with their operation and know my charging cables work.
4,Limited Lifetime,"Apparently Amazon thinks this is battery pack is a game, haha...Oh well... the pack is good... But won't last forever... mine lasted about a year and a half."
1,to good to be true,So far this battery is living up to the rest of the reviews. If something is to good to be true then it is. i got this battery because after fours years of having my original battery packs they are lasting no more than 30 minutes. Saw these on here and figure i would order one and see how it it is. My battery i just got with my new silver controller will last me at least a week worth of playing this one last me about a days worth. You get what you pay for..... spend the extra cash and a white battery. I bought the pink one
1,Don't Buy,I bought two of these and neither hold a charge. I guess they are old. Save your money and buy new batteries only.
4,Nice,"Works well and have had not issues with it. They hold the charge very long. Can go weeks without charging, even though we may not use it, it is always on the back of the handheld and still doesn't die quickly at all"
2,"Great, for a while","These are great, but as mentioned before, they die. I've had three, all different colors, and they all stopped working. Do not buy. Just use regular rechargeable batteries."
5,Must have for Xbox 360,"This is a must have when you have kids playing with Xbox 360. This is such a great deal and no more messing around with batteries. Anyone that has ever searched for batteries, will love this addition."
1,Died after 1st recharge,"I wish I didn't throw the packaging out because I would have returned this in a heart beat. The battery pack worked fine out of the box, but after recharging it; it no longer works. Tried it 3 Xbox 360 controllers and it can't power a single one. Usually the batteries last for years, not days."
1,"Do Not Buy, go bad in 3 months",thee will not hold a charge and one wont even recharge at all. after only 3 months. i still have my original batteries from 5 years ago and they are fine. these suck. do not buy
1,Dead after a month,I have bought 4 Blue packs and 4 pink packs and have now problems with them. I took them all out of the pack to verify they worked and then put the pink ones away to use at a later date. The blue ones have survived Heavy gamer use for the last 2 years and while they don't hold a charge for as long as they did new they still hold a great charge. I would definitely recommend them.*Edit: After using these for a little over a month none of them will hold a charge for more then a couple hours or less if they come directly off the charger and you use them. If you take them off the charger and let them sit for a couple of days they will die immediatly. Do not buy these. Go for the black ones.
1,Battery is dead!!!,It didn't hold a charge at all! I bought two of these and none of them held a charge. This just isn't worth it for me. I bought another battery even if it didn't match the color of the controller.
2,Not worth it!,"I dont recommend these packs for gamers. Mine quit working within a month. People dont know though, that you can bust open these and take the batteries out and charge them in a normal battery charger. I recommend buying the rechargeable batteries and doing it that way."
2,Beware,"Like others have said, these are old batteries and some of them will work others will not. If you are tempted by the low price and choose to ignore the warnings then be sure to buy several so you improve the chances of getting one that works. I bought four and three worked, at least for now. I don't expect them to last for years."
1,"In this case ""buy cheap, get cheap"" applies.","I bought four of the pink batteries and returned three of them as they didn't hold a charge. The one I kept gets very hot when charging, so I'll probably just chuck that one and call it a day."
5,Great replacement battery,My black battery packs have finally stopped taking a charge after 5 or 6 years. I've slowly been replacing them as they die off.Fortunately my buddies haven't seen my bright pink battery pack yet LOLCharges up great! Would be lost without it
5,Still Worth It In The End,"Bought two pink ones for my pink controller and have no problems whatsoever! Came in original Microsoft packaging. For the price they are absolutely worth it, even if they don't last forever. If you're going to shell out the cash for the black ones, get theXbox 360 Quick Charger Kitfor a few extra bucks! Still pays for itself considering all the AAs most of us go through! So far my batteries have held up a good charge, although only a couple months old. Already paid for themselves! Worth it!"
2,Pretty good...for awhile,I've gone through two of these battery packs already. Both died in a little under a year. I expected them to last longer. Yeah you might want to consider buying a bulk pack of AA batteries. Thats what im thinking of doing.
1,Don't buy the pink one,"I have had a battery for my white controller for several years and havn't had any problems. I bought a pink controller and i didn't use it for a few weeks and it wouldn't hold a charge anymore. So i bought another one which i uses on a more regular basis, and it stopped holding a charge and it's only been a few months. I kept it plugged up for like a day, and it starting working again like normal. It worked for about two weeks and now it won't charge again. I can keep it plugged up for hours and as soon as i unplug it it cuts off. I would give my white battery pack five stars, but the pink one is junk."
5,Reliable,"As something made for the XBOX 360 by its producer, it works as expected.I never had problems with this unit.It replaced the old one I had successfully."
1,bad,batteries would not charge brand new because there new pink i dont know fit chargers and controllers would not recommend
5,back up not need as i thought,i bought the extra batteries thinking i might need them quite often. i was wrong. the batteries last for a long time.
1,AVOID PINK!!,"Like many other fools sucked in by the low price, I purchased the Pink Battery Pack as I do not care what color the batter pack is, as I have no reason to look at it while I'm playing, just as long as it functions properly. This one does not. I don't know if it is as other reviewers have said, that the pink packs are old stock and for that reason will not function, but this battery will not charge and will not hold a charge. I have tried to get it to work for several days now and it will not power a controller. BUYER BEWARE! Don't get sucked in by the price like I did.I am attempting to return it for a refund now. We'll see how that goes."
1,Not a true XBox 360 Battery not made by Microsoft,This is not a true XBox 360 rechargeable battery. You have to plug into the battery to charge. Does NOT work with XBox 360 charging base. It works but I would rather have one that worked with the charging base like my other 3 batteries.
2,Will not charge,"I purchased this for my son's Xbox controller (I bought a pink one so that no one would steal it [as there are other Xbox's and controllers in my house]) and it does not ""charge"" it has to be plugged in in order to use it, and I know it is not the charging cord because it works on other controllers, and on this controller with other batteries. It just does not work with this battery."
1,Battery Won't even hold a charge,"Battery died after maybe a month of VERY light use. As in, I charged it a few times, played games maybe 10 times total, and now it won't hold a charge. It's not the charge cable, not the controller, it's the battery."
1,Why are they selling this? Fraud.,I made a mistake by not fully reading the reviews and just looking at the stars. I bought these because of the price. At first I thought it was fully charging then next thing you know it dies. Then now I read the reviews and I'm not alone. I rather buy rechargeable triple A batteries than this. Will be getting a refund. I literally went in the trash to get the packaging.
1,Dont buy it,"After reading reviews some were good some were bad I thought I would take my chance on getting a good battery pack. It came in the mail well, it was still in an original package but it couldnt hold a charge. Im glad i didnt spend much money on this because its not worth buying or tesitng to see if you get one that does hold a charge. Its worthless."
1,Battery DOA,Bought this battery before reading the reviews and when I received it the battery is dead and won't charge at all. It won't even let the controller turn on while plugged in.I assumed the low price was just because people didn't want a pink battery but apparently its because the company knows they are worthless.
1,Doesn't work,"Completely dead, out of the package. The product does not work, they are much too old to still be any good. Do not buy."
1,Garbage,I really should make a habit of reading item reviews before making a purchase. If I had I'd have known these were complete garbage. Totally non-functional.
2,DOA,"I bought this for my wife's pink controller, and it held a charge... once. After that it would not hold a charge. It may have just been old stock. I did not think about returning it at the time, but I would now if I still had it."
1,Dead on arrival,"I ordered two of these ""rechargeable"" battery packs new and sealed because they were cheap ($5). I opened the first one, and it worked for a month or so, until the recharge light remained green on the play and charge cable no matter what the battery level. Because the battery wasn't holding a charge, my wireless controller would power down seconds after I unplugged the controller from the charge cable. I just opened the second one today (July 29th), and it was stillborn. I got absolutely no use out of it, and since I bought these in February, I can't return them. That's why I've got to at least warn others of this old/defective battery scam, because if people have to buy new rechargeable batteries every 2 months, even at $5 each, it's going to end up costing you more than your Xbox Gold membership."
1,"Poor batteries, will NOT hold a charge","These batteries do not hold a charge at all. I bought 4 of them total, and 3 were crap. It was a waste of time. If you need batteries, look at the Xbox 360 controller batteries in a 2 pack black. They are about $20, but they work."
1,Sucks,These are old stock. They no longer have any charge. Do not buy. Spend the extra money for the newer batteries that actually work.
1,Amazon == Crooks,"Amazon and/or Microsoft are knowingly and willingly selling defective products. There is no other reason for the price difference between blue/pink batteries and white/black batteries. Many people have complained about the blue/pink battery packs not working properly and Amazon is continuing to lower the price to get rid of them. DO NOT BE A SUCKER!!!! I bought three of these and none will charge using two different play and charge kits, four different wireless controllers, and two different consoles."
4,save money and the environment,"The math for the money savings versus buying disposable batteries is pretty simple, and recharging the battery in the controller while you are still playing makes life very simple."
5,CHARGE IT!,"This is the best thing since the invention of the wheel! I have a friend who's constantly falling of during games due to his use of aftermarket charging packs. Buy this along with the tower charger for it, you won't regret it. The charge last for a long time and if you buy extras you will always have a back up. One battery usually lasts roughly about 24 hours with constant play. I have four rechargeable batteries and the tower, so I have three batteries for use, especially for guests if need be. I recommend this battery if you want to play without interuptions and want long life usage."
5,Handy,i bought this along with the quick charge kit and it really comes in handy. it charges quick and lasts long. perfect for gaming long hours and resting few
5,Just what you need when your AA rechargables aren't enough.,"I'm doing my part to help the environment by not continuously using up regular AA batteries. Sadly, the Energizer rechargables just weren't lasting long enough, and since the cost for a new set is almost as much as this packet I made the switch. I'm very happy with it so far."
2,"First one didnt work, but second one did.","The first one I got wouldn't charge, and thanks to Amazon not offering an exchange on this item I had to return it and pay for new shipping. I was not happy with that. Once I got the second one in it worked like a charm."
4,Good battery.,"It's the same as any standard controller battery that you can charge, just a helluva lot cheaper. I might buy another one soon."
2,Did not function properly,I an very familiar with xbox charger packs and the usual problems with charger cables. This white battery pack I purchased will only charge for about 20 second intervals and stop. It is unusable.
2,1 of 2 won't take a charge,These batteries were a gamble and since only one of two holds a charge I'd have to say you're better off purchasing the recent stock batteries whick look to only come in black.
1,pack,"was so excited to have this pink rechargeable controller battery pack ordered it on an impluse and waisted my time. It came in the mail in reasonable time but when we went put in my controller and charge it, the pack was defective or dead. it won't charge and now it sits in my junk drawer. what a waste."
1,Awful batteries,"The first fishy thing I had with this product is that it came within a ziploc bag, not the usual hard plastic the Microsoft Batteries come in. I even thought that it was a battery ripoff, but it actually had the MS hologram, so could well be an already used battery. No problem so far as long as it worked, which did well for two months, and yesterday it just stopped charging. They may be a used lot, refurbished, or plain and simple and old and dry useless lot. I've read many complaints about them, but thought that it could be some that come bad, but it results that most, if not all, are bad. I really do no recommend buying this."
5,a great accessory,The rechargeable battery is considered to be a more environmentally friendly way compare with disposable batteries. It is definitely more long-lasting than double AA batteries. These battery packs have long life cycle and sequence. I've had my tow rechargeable packs for almost five years and still working at the quality equivalent to four years ago. An excellent accessory to have.
1,WASTE Not reliable,"Doesn't hold a charge... NO PURCHASE.. sometimes it looks like it might hold charge. Xbox shows that it's a full charge than you play and Boom 'RECONNECT CONTROLLER"""
1,doesn't hold a charge,"bought this battery six months ago and now it will hold no charge, should have known better than to buy a recharge battery for $5."
1,Bought Two: Both DOA,Bought these because I thought they were a steal at $5.00. Should've exercised more caution. Purchased two and put them into my standard MSFT brand 360 battery charger. Both do not work at all. Avoid the pink!
1,Defective,"Ordered 2, one was DOA the other died. THese are not new, the batteries are very old on them. Save your money DO NOT BUY. They are sent it plastic bags, not microsoft packaging. Amazon really needs to clean this listing up."
1,dues not work,"Will not hold a charge at all. Waste of money and effort to try and return.Maybe you will get lucky, But I did not."
1,Terrrrrrrrrrrrible !!!!!!!!,I should have read all the reviews. I bought two and they won't charge - no light at all. I repeatly removed and then inserted the batteries in the charger and only one charged. I'm using the MS double charger. The one that was charged I will try to use. The one that won't charge I threw out.I really hope that MS did not sell these as a surplus to a distributor.YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR.
1,Does not hold a charge.,"Will not hold a charge at all. Waste of money and effort to try and return.Maybe you will get lucky, But I did not."
1,don't buy!,"again, like everyone else says don't buy these thinking you can use em. If your buying them for modding/swapping batteries out with new rechargeable ones itll work just fine. Otherwise, totally useless!"
1,Pink Batteries are Dead / Short Charge,"don't buy the pink batteries (even at $0.50). I bought two at $5.00 because i didn't really care about color and thought saving $10 - 20 was worth having pink batteries. they either won't hold a charge at all, or drain in less than an hour and need a new charge."
1,Great while they work --- $20 really?,I like the Micro$oft charger and battery but I have one that is fairly new which hardly holds a charge. Think I paid $12 for mine but now they are $20... these things are like two double AA batteries. I hate to say... I switching back to AA instead of dumping more money in the micro$oft train.
1,D.O.A. WONT TAKE A CHARGE,WE HAVE 4 XBOX CONTROLLERS WE NEEDED TO REPLACE ONE OF OUR 4YEAR OLD BATTERY PACS.. THE NEW ONE WONT TAKE A CHARGE NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. PLUG UNPLUG AND TRY AGIAN... JUST DEAD OLD STOCK.....
1,I Tried,At the price I really hoped they would be good. I even tried charging them up several times they just wouldn't hold a charge longer than 5 minutes.
1,Would not buy again...older batteries!,"I knew that the pink controllers came out a long time ago but I had figured that buying one of these batteries to match my wife's controller would be perfect and they were a greal deal at only $5. However after charging it overnight on the ""official"" microsoft charger and placing it in the controller it only lasted one play session. The next day, tried to use it and nothing...no power or even a low batt light on the controller. These are probably left over old stock from back in 2006-7 when thery came out. Do not buy unless you just want a cheap batt to charge and play once per day. But really, why would you? I also purchased the Nyko ones and they are great!"
5,Great price for something so hard to find.,"I couldn't find the blue battery packs anywhere except ebay and they were about $50 or $60. These were origional retail price, still sealed, and worked great."
3,So so,"Seems like it's hit and miss with these. They are cheap, which I love. I ordered two, one works and the other doesn't. Seems to be pretty common with these."
3,Got lucky I guess?,"Thought something was up with my knockoff play and charge cable, when I put the pink battery in the light would only go green. Unplugged and plugged several times, gave up and played plugged for a few hours. Repeated this for 2 days, now the light does start red and eventually go green. Batteries work fine and seem to hold a charge as well as others I have."
1,Doesnt charge,"I bought 2 of these battery packs and 1 of them doesnt charge at all. Unfortuatly I threw away package but thankfully, it was cheap."
1,Regret buying the pink ones...,There's a reason they're so cheap... I bought 4. 2 of them held a partial charge for a little while.
4,Not bad.,Not bad. Doesn't hold a full charge long though. Plus the battery packs can become very hot. It might just be the one that I got.
5,Best accessory for the XBox 360.,"this product is almost a necessity for any XBox user/player. charge the battery as you play, then disconnect at any time. this is hands down the best item you can get for your gaming needs and is an excellent alternative to rechargeable AA batteries."
1,looked great,"Looked like a great counterpart to the pink controller I bought my girlfriend for christmas, until I tried to juse it and it wouldn't even start charging. I tried several xboxes, controllers, and cables, but couldn't get it to start charging, rendering my purchase a complete waste of money. I may have gotten a bad unit, but it seems pretty silly for it not to work at all even when it is brand new in official microsoft packaging. Hopefully I hear back from the seller soon about receiving a replacement and/or a refund."
3,The Crazy Years,"*** Spider Robinson has established a reputation as being one of the masters of science fiction, and here he proves Andrew Greeley's point that sci fi and fantasy writers are the philosophers of the modern world. His collected essays, ranging from the rigors of nicotine withdrawal, the variations of stupidity, and the differences between Canadians and Americans, particularly in politeness often amuse, when not hitting too close to home. His wit runs from dry to laugh out loud, yet the one true drawback of this book is that the more agnostic moments will most likely disturb or even offend those who do have faith. At these points, the best advice to readers is to pick out the bones, but keep the fish. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
5,Wound up right!,This after market tensioner fit perfectly and is working great! The location of the lock for removing the belt is beter than the original tensioner as it is located at the top of the unit instead of underneath as on the original. That location made it difficult to get the lock in place wehn changing the belt. This is much better. The price is good on this replacement part. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
5,toads are here today,i really love this cd. coil has some hot sounds. people don't talk about this band anymore. i am sad about that. well if your in the mood for some iced up music then get coil now!!
5,I just wish I could give it 6 stars,"Not only their best album, but one of the best Iv'e every heard. Perfect for any mood and any place. Tracks 2,4,10,11 are from another world. But every song is perfect. All I can say is Wow."
3,"Better than other Toad CD's, but still not great.","Who is paying these people to give 5 stars to this CD? The only Toad CD meriting anything close to 5 stars is Dulcinea, the only one of their CD's I would strongly recommend. In Light Syrup is lousy and Fear is only a little better. Coil has a couple very strong songs surrounded by several average/good ones."
2,"Would have gave it one star, but...","So, I've been looking for a leather scent to put in my closet with my leather jackets. I bought this in the hopes that it would do the trick; NO WAY. These things smell NOTHING like leather. More like a mens cologne. I was ticked, I couldn't believe they even would suggest that it smelt like leather! So I threw it in my outside trash can. The thing is, that trash can smelled horrible, like kitty litter and other horrible outside trash can crap. The next day, after throwing this sucker in, it smelt, not too bad. I was pleased that is served a purpose, so I gave it 2 stars."
3,Smells like men's cologne,"I received this product assuming it would smell like leather; however, it smells more like a men's cologne. I gave it 3 stars because the scent is long lasting."
1,Does not smell like leather,"My Yankee candle ""leather"" car freshener wore out (which incidentally smells exactly like leather) so I decided to give this one a try. It doesn't smell bad it just doesn't smell at all lime leather. Not even close actually. I gave it one star because the term leather inaccurately describes this product."
1,Nasty,Terrible! It smells nothing like leather...I wasn't expecting something amazing but it really just smells like cheesy ax body spray or something!
5,Can't wait for more!,"If you are looking to compliment your collection of genuine, minimalist trip-hop along the lines of Portishead go for it. Go for the 'Salt Peter' album too.Both will sit easily on the shelf with Moorcheba, Lamb, Mazzy Star..."
3,a cartoon format which I found a bit childish,"This book was assigned reading for an advanced course in engineering physics. It is more of a history book, cartoon style, than a serious book on the physics of motion and gravity as observed by Galileo and Newton. I found the presentations on important topics to be painfully vague. You may get a few soundbites from this book, but thats about it."
4,A detailed but lucid tutorial on anisotropic elasticity theory--especially regarding plane strain,"Using a fairly straight-forward mathematical approach, the author lays out the equations for treating problems in anisotropic elasticity theory. I especially appreciate the authors efforts at demystifying various constants and functions used in this discipline by noting when they correspond to intuitively assessable concepts--such as the rotation, bending, or twisting of the body about specific axes. Many of the solutions laid out in this book result in fairly simple expressions, such as quadratic forms. The treatment of elasticity theory addressed in this book is especially of interest to those of us who wish to calculate the stress field of a dislocation, as described in A. N. Stroh's seminal paper ""Dislocations and Cracks in Anisotropic Elasticity,"" Philosophical Magazine 3, 626 (1958)."
4,very good!!!,"This is a great mouse ,intellieye is very precise and the little wheel is such a time saver no clicking on the arrows to go up and down a page :) although sometimes i have to clean the part where the laser is because stuff still gets caught in that little hole no matter what people say.... Great mouse thou!"
4,Great! No mouse pad required or moving parts!,The IntelliMouse w/ IntelliEye is excellent! It has no parts to clean and scans your computer more than a regular mouse. It also needs no mouse pad because it uses a fiber optic lens.
1,"Bad, frustrating!",I recieved this mouse with my Gateway computer and after about a few weaks it had a very very hard time moving! it would never go to where you wanted it to. it was very frustrating
2,Microsoft IntelliLemon,"First of all, this is an excellent mouse. The only better mouse for gaming is the Logitech Mouseman Wheel, and it's a close race between the two.At least for a while.After a month, however, the buttons on my IntelliEye mouse began to stop registering clicks and they soon stopped functioning altogether. Microsoft gladly replaced it for free, so I was okay with the whole ordeal, but unfortunately, after a few more months, the new one suddenly stopped working. I'll probably consider getting the free replacement again, but if it happens one more time, I'm probably just going to forget about it.If you don't mind having to call and order a free replacement every few months, this mouse is a great buy. Otherwise, have a look at Logitech's line."
1,"Defected MOUSE, do not buy","The IntelliMouse with IntelliEye is one of the worse Optical Mouse. I had 2 of these and both of it were defected. Sometime the mouse would stop working, move by itself, and scroll speed would go up and down. I called Microsoft and they had a back order of these because there was so many that were defected. If you want an optical mouse, get the IntelliMouse Explorer, IntelliMouse Optical, or Logitech Optical MouseMan."
4,"Excellent product for fast, easy tax forms","TaxCut State is an excellent product to be used in combination with TaxCut Deluxe (for Federal tax forms). If you purchase TaxCut Deluxe, you are eligible for a full rebate ...for the State edition. After you have completed your federal return with TaxCut Deluxe, the State version will automatically import all relevant data from your Federal return. You can do your state taxes in a matter of minutes! The product would be nicer if it could automatically find your local/county submission mailing addresses by zipcode. Also, if you continue to use TaxCut software from year to year, it can important a lot of data from the previous years files. A great product! The software asks you many of the same questions that a tax preparer would ask you in the H&R block office. ..."
3,Problems with NYC Tax,"If you enter ""NYC RES"" from box 20 of the W-2 form, the product does not transfer the NYC tax. You will get a zero for NYC taxes paid. In order to get around this you have to change it to ""NYC"". In otherwords don't enter exactly what is written on the W-2. I emailed their tech support and they were unable to solve this problem. Very disappointed in their tech support. I'm posting this for you NYC residents out there so it will save you greif."
1,Need FED version to use State one,You do need the FED version to use the State one. What if I only want to use the State version...buy the FED version?
4,Buscemi strikes gold,"Steve Buscemi is right on target with his character in Trees Lounge. Playing a young but probably past-his-prime local, he hits all the right notes about a character who never quite makes it. Drifting through his home town like a lost soul, he is someone we all know, someone we all have seen, especially if we are from the northeast and grew up in a small ethnic community. Movies like this get little attention from the Oscars but contain exceptional performances. The cast surrounding Buscemi is also very good. There was another little known movie called Last Night At The Alamo which was released in 1984 that has a similar theme. Also well acted and right on target. Fans of the Sopranos will probably love this film also. This movie is well worth the small investment. Enjoy."
4,..but was it filmed widescreen ?,"This is a great film, proving that Buscemi needs to have more direction opportunities. It is a must for Bukowski (and Chloe Sevigne) fans. But is this (or the Uk DVD) in the correct aspect ration ? Was it shot in 4:3 (1.33:1) or was it shot wider ?Will someone post a review of the DVd that tells us this and whetehr the DVD is in the correct aspect ration (this is the kind of thing you should be doing, Amazon).As I said, superb movie."
5,Trees Lounge....the place to be.,"Steve Buscemi plays Tommy, an alcoholic who, if he isn't in a bar, is hanging out across the street from his brother's auto shop, just watching. He's angry at him for firing him and stealing his girlfriend. In the meantime, Tommy tries with no success to find a job, and keeps on drinking. When a relative dies, Tommy takes over his ice cream truck business, and takes along Debbie, the niece of his ex-girlfriend, to help him sell ice cream. He and Debbie get stoned one night and end up ""making out like high school kids"", and Tommy has to deal with the wrath of her father. The rest of the cast have thier moments, too."
5,Buscemi Masterpiece,"Trees Lounge will be a film that you will relate to if you are twentysomething and aimless in society today.The film depicts Buscemi as ""Tommy"" an unemployed guy who has to resort to driving his late relative's ice cream truck to survive.The lounge depicts a lifestyle which many will immediately identify with, in today's high tech society there are many who dwell on the fringes, trying to scrape by.Tommy and his cohorts wallow at the Trees Louge while life passes them by...The film has a superior cast including the most adorable Daniel Baldwin, and is poignant moving and sad. A must see."
4,"What ""Barfly"" could have been....","The film ""barfly"" was great because it showcased both the acting talents of Mickey Rourke and the great script by Bukowski. ""Trees Lounge"" lets Buscemi go one up on both of them by fufilling both duties and putting out a film thats even better than its inspiration. ""Trees Lougne"" is slow, subtle and slight. Yet the way it lingers on certain poignant moments, on certain characters and their emotions reminds me of Jim Jarmusch and his use of space and time. ""Trees Lounge"" lacks the idealism of ""Barfly"" but this is a good thing. It holds its own on story and dialouge. In fact, its a far superior film. I get the feeling that Buscemi will mature into a great director if given the time and MONEY (damn hollywood money machine, business round table controlling the world!!!!) See the movie!"
2,"The transition from actor to director doesn't always work. Right, Steve?","Good Gosh almighty, watching Tree's Lounge all the way through is in a way like allowing an embittered Croatian nanny rip your back hairs out one at a time, all while she sings the song 'Scarborough Fair' in her festive native tongue. In other words, it's a rough experience.Okay, so it's not that bad, but it is like hanging out in your garage on a Saturday afternoon, watching your great uncle throw back cold ones while he drones on about politics and the state of the economy. It's not entirely horrible, but you know you could be doing something better with your time.I tried to like Trees Lounge, which deals with a man who owns a bar and drives an ice cream truck around town doing his best now to be seduced by a local teenaged female, but I just couldn't. Be warned. This is not your older brother's independent film. It's Steve Buscemi with too much power and too little wit."
2,Horrible,Doesn't work for vista and it barely works for xp. Don't use included capture software as the encoder is all messed up. Computer doesn't recognize the device half the time. Not worth it
3,trailer light,Bought the light thinking i was ordering a full set of lights for my trailer and it turned out it was only the drivers side light with no brackets or anything other then the lenses and housing and bulbs due to my mistake i have to get a full set and im going to keep this one as a spare it appears well made
2,"A historical treasure, but not effective for learning Italian today","If you have any A-LM Italian books or materials, you have some rather valuable materials on your hands. See my review of A-LM French Level One for a full discussion on A-LM methodology. A-LM Italian materials are very rare as few were produced and almost none remain for sale on the open market today. You won't get thousands for your A-LM Italian materials, but you could get enough to buy some Christmas presents if you sell them. With the exception of the Stone, there are far superior materials for learning Italian available today."
3,Cable is not White!!,"I bought this cable for my white iPad 2. I choose the white to match the existing charging cable; however this cable is gray not white. Otherwise, this is a nice heavy cable that appears to be built to last."
1,Not for iPhones,This cable cannot extend an iPhone charger. That's the whole reason I bought it and it's not going to work. The shipping costs more than the item so now I can't even return it...
1,Doesn't work!,I purchased this for the Ipad 2 and it doesn't work! I plug it in and it doesn't charge the Ipad. Don't waste your money on this.
1,sad lies for a cheap low cost item.,"They are f'ing gray not white.They slapped a label over the one that reads gray usb 1.1 standard.the new label reads white usb 2.1 standard.wrong color a problem.worse they do not support my keyboard an apple wired type.I don't want to bothered with a return for a lousy low cost item like this. even if i got free shipping the trip to the post office to mail it cost me more then they are worth. when a company does this type of mislabel I get so annoyed. It cost me time and aggravation. For what an item that is well under 10 bucks. well if you want gray cables that don't work with apple keyboards buy these "" white "" ones. This company should be avoided there is no way the over label of white 2.1 usb can be an accident. they are just hoping People don't return them. Thanks for nothing but more work for a lousy few bucks."
1,Does not charge iPad,Says it is for iPad... If you can't charge it then what would it be good for? Good thing it was cheap.
1,Did not work with Flip Video Camera,"This cable would not work with my Flip Video camera like it was advertised. I plugged it into my iMac 24"" and into my Flip camera and nothing. For the price I guess that's what I get. Go with the $8.00 one's they work."
4,Use this with your flip and a mac keyboard,I bought this cable because the usb arm on my flip video camera could not fit in the usb ports on my mac keyboard because of the way the ports are placed on the bottom of the keyboard. This cable solved that problem and I can attach the flip to the mac through the keyboard usb ports rather having to go around to the back of the computer.
4,Good for heavy user,I use this cable lot to connect a digital camera to my computer. So it gets a lot of use and it is holding up well. Cables can be chronic for failing under repeated use but this one is good. Nice tight hold and no signs of wear. Its just an inexpensive cable right? But its amazing how important a cable becomes when you can no longer connect to your pc to get some work done :)
2,not for flip - mac os 10.5.3 connection,"Bought it to ease the connection between my flip ultra and my macbook but it only work once out of 10 attempts. Flip-Mac connection works fine without the cable, so the cable must be the problem.Two-star because I'm keeping it and use it to extend my usb hub for the other peripheral which works fine. Also the return cost is probably more expensive than the product it self."
1,Will not charge my iPad 3,"I too purchased this to charge my iPad 3, and it doesn't work for that with the Apple supplied adapter. I purchased this explicitly because it said it it was for various iOS devices.I'm also disappointed, like others reviewers, that it isn't what is pictured. The female end is not covered, but exposed metal.I sent mine back for a refund."
1,weak cable,Bought this cable to use with a 250 gb usb drive. It was enough to power the hard drive but not enough for windows to detect the drive. I ended up using it to connect a printer. Not recommended for connecting hard drives or for high speed data transmission. You get what ya pay for I guess.
5,So helpful for short Apple chargers!,"I am so pleased with this product! When we moved I could not get my Apple chargers for my iPhone 5 or 3rd Gen iPad to reach the nightstand so I began hunting for an affordable solution. Man, did I find it! Not only does this product work beautifully for BOTH products (ignore the reviewer who said it wouldn't charge their iPhone 5), but the price for the 6' cord was hard to beat. Great find!"
1,This cable is greige-- NOT WHITE.,"Office grey color was not what I wanted! I was hoping for a nice, clean white cable to match my other Apple cables. My goal was a tidy set of cables to help create some nominal sense of calm into my chaotic desk space.This cable is not as described."
1,Sucks,"The 3 ft version of this cable is sold by the company ""cmple"" it is not the same cable listed in the description. Cable quit charging my iphone after only 3 uses. Make sure that you get the cable sold by Amazon"
4,Usb Cable,My USB stopped working on the front of my computer so had to use back slot. Very inconvienent so I purchased this cable. It was shipped quickly and attached very easily. Works great!! Give me the ease of use I was looking for. I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,Didn't work with my iPad 1,"Got the dreaded ""Charging is not supported with this accessory"" message. Useless, but at least it didn't cost too much."
4,USB extender,"I wanted something like the Apple USB extenders but longer. This is definitely not as elegant at the Apple extenders, but it's cheaper and it works and looks good enough for most purposes."
3,Not very useful,It is only really good as an extension but did not serve the purpose that I originally bought it for.
4,Works Well,"This cable works as advertised. 4 stars because I just got it and don't know how it will perform in the long-term, but my guess is that if it works well now, there is not much that can go wrong with a USB cable."
5,cable works great,thank you very much.the cable was just what i neededand got we got it when he said we would
5,I wanted an extension cable and I got one,This was exactly what I wanted - I needed an extension cable so I got one.
5,Nice cable,"Purchased two of these cables to use as keyboard & mouse extensions. The cables are exactly as advertised and quality is good. Though color was not important to me, the cables I received are white as the product images suggest."
4,great company and good product,"the company i bought this item from originally sent me a male - male connection cable. i submitted a issue report about my order. lo and behold 5 days later i receive the correct cord in the mail with no questions asked. GOT TO LOVE GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE! the cord itself did have some connection issues. and it does not include a thing on the end to shield the connection. on the plus side it is high-speed, but the down fall is the connection is not shielded (like the picture shows) it does connect securely as far as i can tell....but i would not connect a external HD or the like with this cable due to connection issues that may arise while backing up files. for my mp3 player..SURE! a web cam...sure! over all i was impressed with the prompt service and decent product for the money you pay"
5,M/F cable adapter,"It's pretty hard to screw up a male to female adapter cable. It gets down to, can I get it at a reasonable price? This one not only does it perform well, the price was very competative."
5,usb cable,The usb cable I ordered was in perfect condition. It was the length I ordered and works perfectly.I could not find this product in any stores.
5,This is perfect,"This cable was exactly what I needed, works perfectly, and is sturdy. I needed a longer cable to connect my printer to my computer, so that the printer could be in a different part of the room. It's a great find and the price is very reasonable."
5,Cable perfect,"I needed this USB extension cable because I have a small camcorder that I need to plug into my computers, but the USB arm on the camcorder is too short to use by itself without risking damage to the camcorder. This USB extension cable arrived fast and works perfectly for my intended use."
2,"Works fine, well constructed, but too thick on the male end","I ordered two of these cables and found them to be well-constructed and fully functional, as would be expected for something so simple. However, the plastic housing around the male connector is thicker than on a standard USB extension cable making it very difficult to plug this in right next to another device if you have side-by-side USB ports. In fact, trying to plug both of these extensions into such side-by-side ports starting to put so much side pressure on them that I feared I would damage the ports. Keep that in mind if you are thinking of using this cable."
1,False description -- NOT white,"The description of this item is false and deceptive. It is advertised as being white, to be compatible with white Apple devices. However, what was sent was not white but grey. I see (now) that another reviewer had the same report, so it does not appear to be a fluke. Of interest, even the packaging says it is white."
3,Slows iPad Charging,"I bought this to add some length to my iPad charging cable. Unfortunately, it slows the charging rate to about 20% of the normal rate. Usually the iPad will fully charge over night, but with the extra USB cable it only gains about 30% of a charge in that time. Otherwise the cable seems to be fine."
1,Non-Working,"As far as I can tell, this cable doesn't work. I've tried it with various devices - iPhone, scanner, printer, etc., and I just can't get it to work. This I do not understand. I will explore return options, but it's almost not worth the time/shipping (which may be the sellers' whole point!)."
2,Didn't work for what I needed.,"I purchased this to use with my iPhone 3GS (8GB). After numerous tries, it kept telling me that the phone did not support charging through that device. I tried it on my iPod touch 4th gen (16GB) and it worked for about 5 minutes then stopped. Tried again and same thing kept happening. I considered returning the product until I found out that it could charge my PS3 controller. I guess I'll keep it, but it certainly did not work with my iPhone and iPod touch like it was supposed to."
1,will not work with EyeTV,will not work with EyeTV that no doubt requires a more robust quality cabling to power the device. This Cable would probably be ok if it didn't need to power something.
4,Works like it should,There's not a whole lot that can go wrong with an extension cable. No problems with this product or the merchant.
5,Does what it's designed for,Can't add too much here. I needed to extend my keyboard since it's hooked up to an old Mac box on the floor. Plug it in and I'm off. No problems whatsoever.
1,Does not work with iPhone 5 charger,"Used it to extend my short iPhone 5 wall charger. Plugged into the wall and message on the screen: ""Charging is not supported with this accessory"""
4,USB extension cable,Its a USB extension cable. I use it for my macs keyboard. Never had any problems with it. You can use it for anything that is USB to get a farther reach.
5,Inexpensive and handy to have,"I bought two of these extenders so that my family could use their iPads for extended periods of time without running the battery down. Mostly my mother, who sits in her recliner with her iPad and plays video games for hours. Funny, I know, but there you go. I use my extender because my power outlet is pretty far from my nightstand, where I keep my iPad, so I need the extra length to plug it in at night. Very good price for these cables, and they are thicker than the one that comes with the iPad, so I feel like they will last quite a long time."
1,Won't Charge New iPad,"Very nice idea, but useless for New iPad, which gives a message that ""charging is not supported with this accessory."" I used the stock iPad charger and the stock iPad USB cable, inserting the Cables To Go 26686 Extension Cable between the two. Without the extension cable, the iPad will charge. With the extension cable, it will not charge, thereby defeating the very purpose of the extension cable, at least for my purposes. Very unlikely due to a faulty extension cable, because I bought two of them, and I get the same ""charging not supported"" message with both. It is possible that this problem only manifests with the New iPad and not other devices, but I have no means of verifying whether this is true."
2,Doesn't work to connect my hub to my computer,"I have a 7 port POWERED USB hub below my desk. I bought this as an extension for it so it could reach my computer. Even though the hub is powered, devices would drop connection to my computer constantly or not ever connect ( like my iPhone). I ended up getting a different cable and it works great."
5,Contortionist relief,"If you have your only usb port on the back of your receiver, computer, etc. this little gem will let you bring the access port to the front for easy, and convenient input and retrieval of your data. a terrific product."
1,Will not work with my ipad 3,Charging is not supported with this accessory warning pops up on my ipad 3. It does however work on my iPhone 4S.
2,Not 2.0 compatible,"Surprising this isn't mentioned in the blurb, but this cable, while it may be fine for what it is, isn't 2.0 compatible according to the manufacturer's site, and isn't intended for high speed usage. Glad I double-checked before buying several at this price."
1,Will not charge an iPhone 5,"I purchased this cable to extend the distance I could move with the iPhone while it was charging. However, the cable will not charge the iPhone 5 but instead causes the phone to display a message stating ""Charging not supported with this accessory.""What a waste of money..."
1,Does NOT work for my needs,"Given that this cable is aimed specifically at iOS device users, I assumed that it would work just fine on my iPhone 5. I received it in the mail just this afternoon and to my surprise, this cable doesn't charge my phone because it is a charging accessory that isn't supported. I've read other reviews and they state that it does work, however, not for me. Terrible, terrible product. Defeats the purpose. The only place I'm putting this cable is in the trash. And for the record, the female end of this cable isn't as portrayed in the image of the listing. It threw me off initially, so in essence, I didn't get what I paid for."
2,D-,"It charges very, very slowly. Defeated the purpose of having a longer charging cable so that i could play on my Ipad and still have it charging. I am going to try the new 10ft lightning cable that just came out from apple?"
1,Not compatible for iPad,"This products name should not include iPad. It says it's not compatible when it is plugged in. If you're buying it to extend the reach of your iPad cable, DON'T!"
1,Wrong cable and what was sent didn't function,"I don't have anything against Amazon or Cables to Go. Amazon did a good transaction and was prompt about resolving any issues that came up. Cables to Go was not in the loop, here, but helped me identify the problem with the cable that I received from the vendor that supplied the product FOR Amazon.I received a white, 10' USB cable as ordered, but it was definitely not the cable by product number or apearance as the one that was supposed to be in the box. It was not of the same design. Moreover, the cable that did show up did not even function properly as a USB Cable.I did an RMA with Amazon, and they promptly walked me through a painless and no cost return to the vendor. The vendor was MarginMart, which was impossible to contact for resolution.I like Amazon and its service immensely, have since bought several other products from them without issue; but I won't be buying items provided by this vendor again."
5,Solution for a longer lightning charge cord!!,"I was looking for a longer lightening charging cord for my IPhone 5 and IPad Mini. Since I could not find one, I read a man's solution by using the C2G cable. These cables are very inexpensive!!! Less than $6.00, depending on the length: 3, 6, or 9 foot.Using the original charging cord that came with the device, disconnect the USB/lightning cord from the part that plugs into the wall. Plug in the C2G cord between the original cord and the part that plugs into the wall. Now yow will be very pleased with the new length! The C2G cord is larger in diameter than the original; but, I found that to be minor in comparison to the benefit of incredible length!!!"
2,How to Draw Crash Bandicoot & Friends,"Sorry to say I was very dissatisfied with the condition of the book. The outside of the book was all taped. it was a hard covered booked and all the edges were smashed. Not only that but it came way after Christmas. I was all sent to send it back when my grandson saw it and really wanted it. Besides my better judgement,I had to keep it as I could not break a little boy's heart. It should not have been classified good condition.Thanks! Ree"
4,"Fun to read, easy to learn","I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Crash or likes to draw. The instructions are clear, and it is very easy to follow."
2,Cheap but flimsy,These floor mats simply did not hold up over time. They are made of light-duty rubber and cannot withstand heavy use. They driver's side mat curled up over time and constantly ended up uder the accelerator. Spend a few more $$ and get heavier-duty rubber mats.
2,On our Top Ten List!,"This CD is an incredible mix of fun and learning! There is counting, pretend-play, and whimsy! A great listen for all ages!"
5,Fun!Fun!Fun!,I bought this album because I was looking for something upbeat and different for my son. I had bad luck it the past with children's CD's boring both him and me. The first time I played it my 11 month old started to laugh and giggle. Next thing I know I caught my husband trying to disco to I lost my cookie at the disco. I recommend this CD to all my friends with young kids.
1,I was not thrilled,The songs just did not get me dancing. I have to say I was disappointed. But I love Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not available
5,Very Entertaining!,"My son has just become a huge Sesame Street fan, but I didn't want to constantly plop him in front of the tv to give him his ""Elmo"" fix, so I decided to buy him this CD. I was hoping it would help him laugh, dance, and have fun with the characters without zoning out at the screen. And it has! He loves the CD and likes dancing along...especially to Happy Tappin' With Elmo.The first few times that I played the CD he kept staring at the screen on the tv to see where the characters were, but now he just yells out their names when he recognizes the voice. Very cute!"
5,My kids Favorite (i like it too!),I bought this for a car trip when all we had was a cassette player about 4 years ago. My kids love it so much that the tape is worn out and i need to buy the CD. Some Elmo cd's can get a little annoying when played over and over (Elmo's high pitched voice is a little grating at times) but this one has enough variety that it does't bother me. It's really fun to dance to!
2,Very unhappy,"I bought it and it was defective. Returned for replacement and second one that was sent was defective. Very unhappy. Looks like it would be a fun CD for my grandaughter, so I was most unhappy that I'm left with a defective product."
5,I can swear they slipped in Howard Dean's famous scream into track 1!!!!,"Check it out. I think I'm hearing it right. If it's so, this just cements for me how totally cool and hip the folks are at Sesame Street. No mewling, mamsy-pamsy fluff of Barney or Telletubbies infamy. These are multi-dimensional characters that are so easy to love, for the adult as well as the kid. I think I've got a guy crush on Kevin Clash."
2,"cormega is the illest, but the CD isn't his fault","this cd contains a lot of classic mega tracks that were originally slated to be released on his testament album which never came out. although these tracks are great, many of them are butchered on this album! classics like ""the testament"" and ""montana diaries"" are held to one verse each. ""angel dust"" has also been remixed by throwing in mobb deeps and megas verses from ""crime connection"" in it. these songs are great in there original forms so i encourage mega fans to try to get these gems on-line or bootlegged. Other phat songs like ""we gon buck"" and ""da bridge 2001"" have also been cut. whats phat about this cd are the freestyles featuring big pun, busta rhymes, and just mega by himself...however, most of these are also available online or on bootlegs, throw mega your money if you wanna support his music (i did!) just expect to be disappointed although its not his fault!"
2,This album is a mess,"It was as if someone took every song they could find that Cormega is featured on, chopped off his verses, and made it a track on this CD. I'm not sure if Cormega even had anything to do with this album. I hope not."
3,Bad grammar in a grammar text. Buyer beware,"page 6. She had been fixing that old clock. (Wrong)Martin had never seen a kangaroo before. (Wrong)She had been napping when the fire broke out. (Wrong)page 11. She had been speaking with John. (Wrong)page 53. Eric had carried Pam. (Wrong)page 25. ""The past perfect tense expresses an action that began in the past and ended in the past."" Absolutely not true. That's what the past tense does. Most of the past perfect material is excluded from Amazon's 'Look Inside' feature, probably for good reason, but there is enough showing to know that this book does not handle the past perfect correctly. Maybe it's worth buying for the other aspects of English grammar, but if the writer is willing to propound nonsense in one area, why would you believe what is written in other areas? Buyer Beware!"
4,Hypnotic,"I've had the foreign version of this CD since I walked into a middle eastern restaurant and heard Gotan's version of Frank Zappa's ""Chunga's Revenge"" playing on the stereo. (I'm a HUGE Zappa fan and I really enjoy it when other bands tackle the challenging music of the master.)Everything else here is pretty good, too. I like their other cover version here, as well--Gato Barbieri's ""Last Tango in Paris.""You're not gonna get up and dance with this one but if you want to relax or fool around with your significant other, this CD will do you just fine."
5,Sleek tango-ish Trip hop style,"This is a hard one to explain, I fell in love with this album right away, it's culture behind it, the classic tango sound, blended with a electronica/trip hop-ish style kicked into classic rhythmic move your hips flow.I personally love this album and know that if you have a taste for tango, or even trip hop/electronica, this will probably please the hard to please.just good music.=S="
5,the best tango music ever recorded,this album is one of my favorites. the fact that it is so unique and well made sets it apart from anything else in the genre.5 stars. Top 25 favorite albums all time imo
5,The title says it all,"I first heard this album on Radio Nova at of Paris and I was just amazed by this new sound. When hearing Latin music with a house background we have been accustomed to hearing Bossa Nova. Well this album takes it to a completely different level. Tango! The style of the tango ranges from very classical to very modern (voices) and the beats in the back are great. Although it has house beats, it manages to portray Argentina and the tango beautifully. I really liked ""Santa Maria del Buen Aire"" and ""Triptico"".To enjoy without moderation. It is indeed the revenge of the Tango!"
5,"Argentinean, NOT Brazilian","To all those who think tango is Brazilian, it is not. It is from Argentina. If tango is from Blazil, then caipirinha is from Russia. Anyway, a very nice CD. Tango for the electronic masses...Ay! Milonga de amor..."
1,Awesome Album,"Not only was this CD Fantastic - So was the supplier !!!! They estimated 3 weeks delivery & I received it in 10 days (from Austrailia, no lees !!!!)I highly recommend to any one who likes Authentic Latino Music"
4,nothing to lose,"actually i cant believe that there is a kind of music like that >> Tango+Electric , its pretty cool ......enjoy ;)"
5,Tango's Revenge is Sweet.,This CD has been in my CD player at least once a day since I got it. The timeless beat married with modern musical technology is brillant.
5,If you have never been in Buenos Aires this is like it feels,"...Gotan Project awesome I discovered them listening to KUT public radio in Austin, in Eclecticos the morning music program. The CD is just great. It has the flavor of Tango with that modern contemporary twist but more importantly with the Urban feeling of Buenos Aires, everytime I listen to it in my long car commute I feel there at home in B.A....the same that when I listen to Piazzola.It's the future of Tango and it is the revancha...."
2,A little short,"I did not understand that I was ONLY buying the Extra Tracks CD, the CD with most of the tracks was ABSENT."
5,Excellent music,"This CD presents a different kind of genre that inmerses you into the old times at Buenos Aires, Argentina with the traditional tango while at the same time gives you a taste of some new smooth electronic kind of music. love it!!! Cannot stop listening to it."
2,Not what I expected,"After listening to the previous album ""Lunatico,"" I thought this album would have the same talented composure. A bit of a dissapointment."
5,Excellent service,I received my purchase in a very timely fashion and it was in excellent condition true to the seller's words.
4,I Love the Music.,"Orginally, I bought this CD for one song, ""Santa Maria [Del Buen Ayre]. This song was used in the movie, ""Shall We Dance, "" with Richard Gerr, and Jennifer Lopez. The two of them danced the tango to this. WOW. Since I purchased the CD the rest of the music has grown on me, and I love it."
5,"Now that I found this, I want more!","Since i got this CD for xmas, I've been playing it almost everyday at work. Every track stirs something inside that makes me want to dance a sexy dance of Tango."
4,tango nuevo is back again,"A lot of musicians try to make a new and more modern form of tango but very few succeed, because they don't seem to catch the soul of tango. Gotan Project combines the strong sensuality with the rules of modern dance music. I believe a better combination is still possible but this CD is certainly worth listening to.Enjoy it!"
5,"Hip hop, accordions, tango and hot bloodedness","A release with heart, soul, guts and seething passion. The use of accordions with beats and tango is novel and instantly grabs your attention. A powerful and enjoyable release, not to be missed.When I play tracks from it on the radio I always get calls from listeners wanting to know what it is."
4,very interesting,"just like saint germain pumped up the jazz these guys pump up the tango...it still does have the classical tango feel, yet it is so close to being frenchthe cd is good, it needed two or three more tracks"
4,Good Portuguese book,Best when used in conjunction with a class. I used this book while in Brazil learning portuguese with 20 other students from around the world.
4,Pretty great debut,"Despite being fairly young in age, the boys from Pilot Radio are veterans of the music scene, and this 5-track offering shows exactly how much talent they have to offer the music industry. While most of these songs were written in their younger days as a group (before they even became known as Pilot Radio), but the songs are still amazingly well-produced and recorded. Josh Moore of Caedmons Call fame produced the cd, and overall it's a great buy for anyone looking to find something along the vein of Counting Crows."
4,Inspiration,This album contains full of inspiration. I can guarantte Justice will take you high. Go and get it now!
4,"Flat Marvel is ""Marvel""ous!","I LOVE this product! My hair stylist turned me onto to it a few months ago and I fell in love with it! My thick naturally curly/wavy hair is now under control when I straighten it with my flat iron. It stays straight all day long! This is a first for me. I even use it when I don't straighten because it still helps smooth my frizz and flyaways. Also, Amazon is offering this at a great price! Take advantage of it while it lasts."
2,I DON'T GET IT,"Let me say first, I love Kenny Loggins. I don'tcare for celebrities telling us how to liveour lives and how fabulous their's are. Howmany times has he been married???......That aside, the cd is boring and non-descript.Kenny can do so much better. I know he stillhas it because his ""December"" is perfection."
4,"Not One of His Best, But Still Good Even If He Left His Wife",One of Kenny Loggins most underrated albums of all time. A followup to 1991'sLeap of Faithit was also a CD companion to the book of the same name. C'mon Loggins publish your biography!The Best songs:All I Ask (co-written with Babyface)One Chance At a TimeThis Island Earth (written for the 1992 documentry of the same name.Loggins even won an Emmy for the song! It's sad that he never turned it into a hit single...
2,A MUSICAL MISFIRE,"The good news is that Kenny sings his heart out, obviously committed to this personal catharsis and his book THE UNIMAGINABLE LIFE. And the talent of the musicians is impeccable and near flawless. The bad news is that this late 90s effort finds Kenny sounding like every pop boys band out there--N'Sync, Boys II Men, etc. Little of Loggins' fun-loving persona shines through. The songs aren't that remarkable and they all overstay their welcome, most of them clocking in around 6 minutes average. The best tracks are more straight-forward and capitalize on the song's strengths: ONE CHANCE AT A TIME and THIS ISLAND EARTH. While I'm a firm believer that artists should stretch and explore new territories in their careers, there's only so much African rhythms and ecological messages I can validate. I really like Kenny Loggins and recordings after this brought him back down to earth. If an artist is allowed a misfire, this is Loggins' biggest."
1,An Unimaginable Album,"After listening to this cacophonous nightmare at a friends house, we agreed that she wasted her money and I need not waste mine. We do not care about Julia, or anything else in your whiney new age life. Airing this much laundry makes me think ""thow doeth protest too much"" If you are really this happy, you just act it, and dont need to constantly explain it. Dont forget, this is a woman who slept with a man cheating on his wife. This makes the music a big bunch of BS. Their ""love"" hurt a wife and three children. Absolutely disgraceful."
4,Wow - fast and easy,This made making iced coffee a breese to make. Measuring was so easy and not messy. No guesswork as to how much to use with the attached measurer. Only drawback is not enough favoring but still tasted like you just made it yourself.
4,"""Third Edition Rules, First Edition Feel""","Necromancer Games' tagline is ""Third Edition Rules, First Edition Feel"" and Barakus embodies it quite nicely. Combining a fully-developed metropolis, a massive dungeon and a number of side quests in and around both, with more than a dozen key NPCs, Kenower and Webb have delivered a product equal to some of the best WotC sourcebooks. It's both comprehensive enough to build an entire campaign around, and flexible enough to pick and choose elements to add to existing campaigns. Granted, some of the plotlines are rather generic, but that's forgiveable. What's not is its editing, or lack thereof, as the number of typos and spelling and grammatical errors is terrible! Despite that, it's worth the price of admission."
1,Don't waste your money on this product,"We got headaches from trying this monitor -- the low-droning, incessant static was annoying, and it barely picked up any child-related noises. One night, my daughter just came downstairs and into my room to wake me because the monitor didn't -- with both units at full volume, I heard nothing! We bought this to replace an Evenflo from 9 years ago; we liked the feature of that one to talk to the baby (almost like a walkie-talkie). This one has that feature, too, but it's useless because the sound quality is so disappointingly poor."
5,BulletProof Diva For Sure,"I read this book in a 11th grade English Composition Summer School Class, my teacher was realitivly new and wanted to keeps us interested, so out comes the class trip to a local Bookstore to hear Ms. Jones read from her Book. All week long we had been going over it and I was impressed! Being a young Black female I could totally relate to the issuse in the book especially the ones on hair. In person Ms. Jones is very personable and funny. Reading this book and meeting her in person has given me the determination to continue my writing career in hopes that I too will become one of the Lisa Jones of the World. The Book itself is Funny,Interesting and at times very emotionally charged. I recommend it highly"
5,This book is a must read for every woman,"I purchased this book when I was still a teenager, and to be honest, I dont remember what attracted me to the book. I like to consider it one of those moments where fate leads you to somthing that will make life-journies a lot easier.Bulletproof Diva became ""my bible"" I carried it in my bookbag along with my schoolbooks and dreamed of becoming a woman like Lisa Jones who so eloquently articulates her lessons her passions, her battles and her life. I am now 26 years old, and my worn dog eared copy of this book (which has survived a building collapse, two moves and several tempermental boyfriends) is still listed as a favorite.I hope that it will inspire, elevate and nourish your soul, as it has mine!"
3,Underwhelmed,"For the price, I was expecting a bit more quality. What this amounts to is a simply made box with plastic inserts at the top; containing Daisy BB's that adhere to a post-it note-like adhesive strip stuck to the lid that allow the BB's to fall on a chime in the bottom of the box. The BB's stick around the perimeter of the adhestive strip, not all of the BB's adhere. They drop one by one onto inexpensive tinny sounding chimes that are in the bottom of the box. Depending on how many stick to the adhestive strip, the BB's will drop for about 20 minutes. The box requires assembly (little squares on top of the box are actually screw heads: the adhesive strip had to be applied to the box lid, and the chimes required insertion into the bottom of the box.)If you are looking for a gift to impress someone, you might do better buying something else."
4,An excellent text for the advanced reader,"This is a concise treatment of major foundation topics in financial economics. Although my interest is in monetary economics and macro, I finally have a book I will keep and use on financial economics. It closely blends the insight and ""wisdom"" behind the various theories with parsimonious amounts of math. Careful, patient reading and a comfortable grasp of econometrics is required but will be rewarded. Notation changes were a bit of a problem, though the authors address this issue early on. The end of chapter questions are good but it would've helped to have answers. Overall, it is intuitive ""page turner"" material."
5,The only book you may need for financial econometrics!,"Finally, we have a book like this. It is comprehensive, not so hard to follow, and handsomely structured. It shows you the power of combination of mathematics, statistics, and finance. It is like beer. It makes you dizzy and enchanted simutaneously.It stimulates you to dream of modeling the stock market and know the tomorrow's price of Amazon.com. At least, I am going to give it a try! You can have fun, make money, and look mysterious at the same time.Review or learn the math and statistics courses necessary for the book. Read the book three times. Then, you are near the top of mountain."
2,Last quartile on the subject,"This book used to be a must the first time it has been published but after ten years it is getting old and the topic is now better covered by some others authors. The arch/garch section is really weak and this book by its sole is not enough to implement advanced models.The authors also forgot to include practical implementation of the models with Splus or Matlab or whatever language, which is now almost a standard in many financial engineering related books."
4,Vavavoooooom!,Barbieri really strikes it up. Romantic and Dynamic. I think many will agree this might be great bedroom music??????????
5,best of him to day,"Well this entire work is of art and in the class of Europa! A must have in the collection. Wish it was on SACD format though, but still is recorded very very good for a standard CD.Would be a test bench for my high end system if on SACD. You will not be disappointed, great music!"
3,More Caliente!,"Lovers of Gato's smokin' saxaphone will enjoy this album, which is stylistically similar to his previous work. However, I think his original albums are still his best."
5,If you're a jazz fan or would like to be one...,"Like some of the other reviewers, Que Pasa was my introduction to Gato Barbieri. I'm not a big jazz fan, but one doesn't have to be to appreciate Barbieri's music. Other categories of jazz, such as fusion, are often too much of a challenge for my musical tastes, but Barbieri's music works with me. Whether you're getting into jazz or just want some smooth jazz in your music collection, check out Que Pasa."
4,Finally can wear my hair curly!!!,"I straighten my fine but naturally curly hair every day. I could never get the curly thing right. It always ended up horrible and frizzy looking, definitely not ""done"". I bought this based on reviews at totalbeauty and I LOVE it! I really exaggerates the curl. Sprayed on wet hair, scrunched, dried a bit with a diffuser...it looks like the magazines. I felt totally sexy and different the first day I did this and got tons of compliments, and I just said ""this is my natural hair""! My husband loved it, I looked like a different person (LOL)."
3,This is the beganing,"All that remains is one of the best Metal bands of America because Its sound dosents seem to be trying to show-of, and has a European Style"
5,Killer,"This is one great record from a new band. The vocals are hardcore and the guitars are great, lots of harmonies and great solos. Buy it!"
5,Best Stove I have every owned...,"For light weight, durability and usage, this is the best stove I have owned. I have or have used several of each brand of MRS, Optimus, Jet boil and others. This stove is by far the best I have used. Best feature besides burning many fuels well is that one can control simmer very easily regardless of the food product cooking. It works better than any other I have used at high altitude (7,000 feet and up). My other stoves are now for backup or loaners."
1,review is good,"I don't understand why they bring me used goods.On the web, products was shown new one.I already return it.how can I get my money what I spent for turning goods."
5,gund lamb review,"this is my daughters 3 Gund Comfy Cozy Lamb, she has loved all of them and two are wearing out. She saw the new one that was plush and oh so soft and requested a new one for Christmas. Hands down this is her favorite item to sleep on, even @ 5!"
4,Soft but smaller than anticipated,"This arrived in plastic and was very soft and pretty, but a bit smaller than we expected."
3,Meh,"I received this at my baby shower. It was hand-me-down, so who knows how many kids it's seen, and it's still clean, soft, and cute -- definitely wins points for quality, durability, and ease of laundering.But my son couldn't care less about it. In the twelve months since he was born, he's never once so much as nibbled on it or fiddled with its sewn-on eyes or tail or ears or ANYTHING. And he's a hard-core nibbler/fiddler. It gets more use as an emergency blanket when he's conked out on top of us and nothing else is in reach.I can totally see this becoming a baby's favourite lovey, and it's so well-made, it would probably outlast the lovey stage. But if you've got one of those high-energy, inquisitive, fiddly babies, it may not be a good investment. This is just not interesting enough for my son, even when he's falling asleep!"
4,Very Cute!,"The cozy lamb is very, very soft and cute. I think my granddaughter will get many years of use from it."
5,Great to look at the past,"Great to look at the pastLearn from years of experience, train spinning with DVD images and complete step by step Tour de France collectionSaludos"
1,Piece of Junk!,"Bought three of these and not one worked. First one broke after 10 minutes; second one never worked at all; third one lasted 10 minutes also. Decided to take the motor apart on the third to see why (only paid $3.99 at 90% off, so what the heck). Turns out it only has cheap plastic gears inside. Therefore, as soon as it begins to labor (10 min. max), the teeth break off. Wasn't even worth the $3.99. Customer service was of no help either. They never answered my email after the first one broke. I was even willing to ship it at my expense so they could fix it. Don't waste your time with this rip-off. Only sorry I can't leave less than one star."
1,Fire the engineer who designed this.,"The aluminum cylinder freezes the liquid. Unfortunately, the plastic scraper did not scrape the ice forming on the cylinder. Instead, the frozen layer got thicker and thicker until the ice layer pushes against the scraper, and the gears begin to grind and then freeze. We were unable to make even one batch. Do not spend your money on this machine."
1,Worst piece of junk I have ever bought.,This junk did not even begin to make a slushie. We had to use the blender and the kids were so disappointed. My return lables are being sent as we speak. One person said: There was no way to give a 0 review. Please do not waste your money.
1,Worthless,Complete piece of garbage. Send it directly to the recycling bin so at least the plastic parts might be able to be reused for something else.
3,Deception,"I bought this booke based upon the commnents I heard from the author S. Cohen.I'm a bit disapointed because it is not really up to date and I expected the online service that I have to buy apart.Where , at the moment I don't know?The price is ok."
4,Educational and Entertaining,"This video is a wonderful tool to introduce people to the ancient Egyptians and their beliefs in the afterlife. Young people will really enjoy the way the story is told as well as the spectacular visual images. For the more informed about ancient Egypt, this video still offers the spectacular images of the pyramids, the Nile, and ancient life and death in Egypt."
4,Key ring compas,this is perfect for day hikes. It easily clips into my backpack and is easy to read and use
1,Cheap and Hazardous,"When I opened this package, I immediately thought it looked like a $1 or $2 trinket I could have picked up at dollar store.I kept it for a day, decided it was nothing special, and told Amazon I wanted to return it.At that time, I was told by Amazon that I could not return the item because it contained hazardous materials that were against Amazon's Shipping Policy, rendering it non-returnable. I was shocked, because this was ...just a compass! I had to send a couple of emails back and forth with Amazon before being told that the liquid inside the compass is ""absolute ethyl alcohol"" - a hazardous item that they would not accept as a return. I am still interested to learn how Amazon managed to ship this in the first place, however.This item, I feel, is overpriced. Maybe not 1 Star, but this way someone will spot it among the 4 and 5 star reviews that exist for this item."
5,great steering wheel for the computer,"My son bought this and he loves it. All my kids love it plus it is more fun to play the driving and racing games. It was easy to hook up, plug in, and play. It does clamp onto the desk so make sure there is room."
1,Problems with Microsoft Racing Wheel.,"This wheel works very well, when it works. Installation was easy, and I was very happy with the wheel the first few times I used it. After that, my machine would not recognize the device. I am running a Dell 1GHz with 128MB and an NVIDIA GeForce Ultra with 64 MB. I know my way around computers, but nothing would get the device to work again. Now I find that this is not an uncommon problem. I feel as if Microsoft has once again slipped one over on us."
4,Works great for me,"I don't know why so many people have written about problems with this wheel. It works great for me on my 500Mhz Micron. I have used it with NASCAR 4, Midtown Madness 2 and NHRA Drag Racing 2with no problems at all. You just have to make sure it is first on the controller list with some games that default to ID#1. That means I usually unplug my sidewinder joystick when I use it, no big deal..."
5,Windows 2000 and the Precision Racing Wheel,I called around and I never got a definite answer. I just wanted to know if the wheel would work with Windows 2000 Pro. It's fantastic. I have recommended it to all my racing friends.
4,Nice mix of familiar and not so familiar holiday tunes,"I had this CD back in the 90s. I don't know what happened to it so I reordered it on Amazon. It features all the artists you normally hear on the radio at holiday time. Most of the songs are familiar, but there are a few rare tunes, as it were on this CD as well. My favorites are:Christmas Carousel - Peggy LeeHurry Home For Christmas - Steve & EydieMy Favorite Things - Andy WilliamsToyland - Doris DayRudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer - Dean MartinBing's White Christmas is on here, but The Christmas Song is sung by Mel Torme, who wrote it. It has a different opening (""All through the year we've waited . . .""), but sounds good. Nat is represented here singing Deck the Halls. Sinatra, Mathis, Como, all the usual suspects are here. Nice for a family gathering or background for a holiday party."
4,A Nice Mix Of Cool Christmas Classics,"Some of the biggest names in the recording biz are all on here-guys with names like Bing, Frank, Perry, Nat, Tony, etc.; as well as gals with names like Ella, Rosemary, Peggy, Doris, Jo, etc., all familiar old friends. You can't beat the price, either for all this talent on one holiday collection. Lots of good stuff here-Tony Bennett's Santa Claus Is Coming To Town starts things off & is followed by such tunes as Perry Como singing Silver Bells, Frank Sinatra's Christmas Waltz, Ella's Silent Night & many, many more. One or two songs are so-so(and no, I won't mention them)which is why I only rated it 4 stars-which still is not a bad deal. Highly recommended."
1,Extremely bad binding,I purchased this product for my wife who enjoys the pictures and the recipes. Upon first use however pages fell out of the binding and then kept falling out after each use.
3,This is not a cookbook.,"Folks, be warned - this is not a cookbook, although one would think so from the title. It is a very nicely done genealogical work focusing on eastern Kentucky. If you order it thinking it is a cookbook, you will soon be paying the return postage."
1,Terrible,"I like that type of movie, T2 was my favorite movie of all time, but this was horrible. I am a fan of both Christopher Plummer and David Morse, so I'm surprised it was that bad. Send me a dollar for postage and you can have mine."
4,Mixed up confusion,"The music is period specific but still exhilarating. It took me a while to find the right album and it is this first album which features Carl Palmer. But he isn't the story here. The story is Vincent Crane, a talented keyboardist quite clearly depressed. His sad tragic life was apparently a 20 year descent into ever growing depression which ended in suicide, and his lyrics presage his tragic journey. Listening to it with that history is a little spooky but the music itself is top notch."
5,Vincent Crane; artist for the ages,"Simply put,Crane was a musical genius with talent to spare.His playing and compositions are second to none. If you appreciate quality hard rock music, this is a great choice."
1,This caulk never hardens!,"This is THE WORST product of any type that I have ever used. It never hardens. It cracks, and wipes completely off when you are cleaning, even months after installing it. The people that make this product should be ashamed."
1,GE 2 Clear Silicone,"I spent a lot of money and time to install a new stainless kitchen sink, faucet and strainer, used this caulk for the seal and it never cured...not even after 2 weeks.I'll never use this product again. what a mess this was to clean up and replace.I used Corning clear with no problem"
1,Bought expired product which never cured,It appears that Home Depot has been aware of the problems with the GE silicone for at least 4 years. They are still selling expired cartridges. I spent hours and hours to prepare the job and now I have to spend extra time to wipe the mess up. I am not only mad about GE but also about Home Depot to sell me this stuff.
1,Worst Practical Joke Ever,"What everyone says on here is true. This stuff never cures, and I am livid. Maybe the cure temperature is -100degC, who knows. Home Depot managers who made the decision to still sell this stuff are complete idiots. GE, put silicon sealant on your R&D list...this product reflects your image."
4,Nice Book,"They Call Me Coach by John Wooden is Wooden's autobiography. The book tells how Wooden was too shy to talk to his high school crush all the way to his NCAA championships. To help you get a feel of the book and Wooden as a person I'll point out that Wooden carried a cross in his pocket everywhere he went to remind himself of his religious duties. But he also pointed out that the cross is not an idol, just a reminder. I was hoping there wasn't going to be a lot of basketball talk in They Call Me Coach but I was expecting it. There wasn't too much talk of basketball until the end so I was happy. I was getting a little bored at the end though because it seemed like that was all he was talking about. But Wooden's simple writing style, thoughts on life, and honesty made it a very great read."
5,A classic book about a classic coach.,"When you have lost all of your faith in sports, buy and read this book. Coach Wooden takes us through the wonderful journey of his life, from a young boy growing up in a small Indiana town to the multiple national championships at UCLA. Its too bad there aren't more coaches like John Wooden, a truly inspiring individual"
4,Excellent for beginners - but no Bass Clef playing in it,This book is great. Just remember to shift your hands as indicated by the finger numbers and be sure to master those notes as they teach you before moving on too fast. But you'll be surprised how fast you learn. But everything in this book is on playing notes and scales on Treble Clef. There is no bass clef in this book or the second (Keyboard Chords & Scales)... I just bought it 3 weeks ago and am loving it. The book does teach you music notes. It just gets confusing when it renumbers the notes (not explaining that your hand is moving over a key for a while and then back again. They make it sound like you just reach your finger while keeping your hand in place. This is not true after the first page of learning A and B notes in Middle C.) But I am wonderfully surprised at how fast you pick up and start playing. I never read music before and now I am. That in itself is amazing.
2,"Not great,but not awful","I wasn't thrilled by this book, but by the same token, I wasn't impelled to get my money back. It's...well, okay, I guess. Much of the info here, as was noted, isn't verified, and I have a feeling that a lot is bogus. I was hoping for something more along the lines of the Darwin Awards. That said, one does get some laughs here."
4,dumb de dumb dumb,"I believe it was Einstein who said that only two things were infinite, the universe and human stupidity. Enterprising writers have turned the latter into a cottage industry, News of the Weird and The Darwin Awards being two of the more well-known examples. This book is a worthy contender, with nearly 250 pages of prime Grade-A idiocy. While I've docked it one star for lack of documentation (I suspect a few fictional and/or urban legend stories may have snuck in), those merely looking for a good laugh at the expense of other members of our highly-evolved(?) species will get their money's worth. Categorized into 12 chapters, each of which could probably have been a book in itself."
1,Buy the standard edition and save money¡¡,"I thing Mobile Fidelity is a great company and usually made reference recordings. At least this one is NOT a reference recording. The sound is just good, but the sound from the standard CD is good too¡¡¡ I'm an audiophile and I know what I'm talking about: this is not a record to die."
5,"Nuremberg Raid - - - WHY IS THIS ""REQUIRED""",An Excellent quality book that I found very interesting and informative regarding the historical narrative of the RAF raids over Germany during World War II. I learned that a close friend was mentioned in the book and spent more tha a year as a Prisoner of War in German camps.
3,La Vida No Vale Nada IS worth a better DVD print--please!,"I have to agree with any reviewer disappointed with the state of this 2003 dvd release. It sure doesn't do this film justice. Is there another version available?!As someone who has only now discovered Pedro Infante, I found this film his most provocative. You've got to respect Pedro's portrayal of an alcoholic at war with himself, so upbeat when he's sober, and so totally anarchic with a few drinks. The family/work ethos attracts and repels him, and each ""good"" situation becomes claustrophobic. The cantina is full of like souls, only Pedro sings better than the rest of 'em, and doesn't find his way back home. Or does he? The film raises this question.I hope someone will track down good 35mm elements and restore La Vida No Vale Nada for real!"
1,digitally remasterized?,"Is this movie digitally remasterized? No way...unless the company remasterized a VHS of dubious quality.As a customer, I want to get what I am offered by the vendor. If I get a DVD labeled as 'digitally remasterized', I expect an excellent image and great sound. This is not the case.No way they used a master from an original negative, the Lord knows why."
4,Tower We've Lost You,"Some brilliant three chord magic here. The first six songs are some of the most cleverly-arranged pop songs you may ever hear. After that, it's still three chords but not nearly as inspired. If you view this record like a plane crash, the first six songs are a pristine take off and ascent (It's About Time, Down About It). The next three or four are the plane ""plateauing"" (Dawn Can't Decide, I'll Do It Anyway) After that it's a very gradual loss of elevation and the plane begins descending. Finally, the whole thing explodes in the end with ""The Jello Fund"", quite possibly the worst song of any genre ever to be recorded."
1,Major Dissapointment,"""It's a Shame About Ray"" showed the Lemonheads potential, potential that is saidly squandered with this (most likely hurried) follow-up. Although 'Into Your Arms' is pleasent, it's not worth buying the whole album for. Save your money. If you want to try the Lemonheads, I suggest their earlier material."
3,Rick James-Style!!!!!!!!,"If this song would have been released today it's easily a #1 HIT! Way before Nirvana was having their dark moments Evan had his just like the late great legend KING OF PUNK FUNK RICK JAMES! I got this cd just to hear Rick James Style and loved it to the fullest, The Lemonhead should have enjoyed more commmerical success as they are better than today half/as bands but thing happen. Rick powerful voice comes in just like his last release (Deeper Still) and Rick went out with a bang. For those of you who have been living under a rock and don't know who Rick James is do your research and learn about the King of Funk and Roll."
2,This recording was disappointing.,"This is not another ""It's a Shame About Ray."" The only song I liked, ""Dawn Can't Decide"" didn't save this waste of time and money. ""Into Your Arms,"" written not by Evan Dando, but by Robyn St. Clare (?) is candy pop fluff and never should have made the cut (although it found its place on this album). If you want to hear Lemonheads at their best, go back to Amazon's listing of Lemonheads albums, click on ""It's a Shame About Ray"" and buy it."
4,good pop rock album,"this the second album from dando that i own,the other being,""It's a shame about ray"",is a good pop rock album.i usually despise pop but dando gets away with it for me for some reason.maybe why i like it so much is because of the addition of one of my faves,julianna hatfield singing back-up on most of the album.my only problem with the album really is ""the jello fund"".can somebody explain why it's even on the album? otherwise the album is very good.the lyrics sometimes are a little less to be desired but than dando redeems himself with songs like,""big gay heart"".so if you're a fan of ""it's a shame about ray"" this album shouldn't come as a big disappointment as it's not as great as that one is but is still a good album nevertheless."
4,Never less than amazing,"despite being a diehard,longtime fan I can wholeheartedly assure anyone that this album is great and deserves a bit more credit that it has been given. Evan Dando has the voice of an angel as usual, and can make even the most banal pop sound sweet and beautiful."
3,Sweet then sour,"Highly uneven generic gen-x'ers start off unfairly hot with a smoking set of alternative rock, though by album's end can sound like a disc of b-sided throwaways."
5,Read this,"I red many books I my life, I studied literature for many years, and this book is the greatest one I ever red."
3,It was a Ok book that I needed to read.,I had to read this book for my english class but it was worth it though. It was alot better then any of the other books we needed to read. It had a great plot that can be followed and really kept the interest of the reader. I would tell other people about it. The other people in my class liked it too. It was a great book and if i had time to read it again i would read it again in a heartbeat. It is great book and i give it a good rating.
1,I need an asprin,"So I read this book for a small book club and I could NOT make myself finish it. The whole ""no paragraph"" thing totally made it unreadable for me. I got through like 2 or 3 chapters before shuting it closed and throwing it on the floor. It had the potential to be a good story too. I say skip it."
1,Utterly dissappointing!,"Perhaps there is too much hype surrounding the genius of Franz Kafka. This book talks about a stupid idiotic eloquent guy named K. Situations as experienced by him, such as constantly keeping faithfully to appointments, when he should try to report to the police or run away or do something else just illustrates how incredible the story is....It's as absurd as you could get.The style of publishing by Schocken Books is weird. No one arranges the dialoque like they do. Very difficult for readers.All said, if you still think this book is worth a star - because it's FK, at least a credit for his efforts - go ahead and be sorely disappointed."
1,Disturbed Psychobabble,"I thought it was time I expanded my literary experience to include a higher-education type author. Big mistake. I always try to see a book through to the end no matter what but this one really tested that conviction. I was ready to pitch it into the fire after the first chapter as Mr. Kafka himself suggested we do with all of his 'work'. And why didn't I like it? Because it's nothing more than disturbed stream-of-consciousness phychobabble...dark, depressing, manic, mundane, absurd, surreal. Very Lewis Carrolesque but without the imagination and color. You feel as if you're trapped in this guys never-ending disjointed dream with the vague awareness that you will eventually wake up. You do, after you turn the last page and realize that you've just wasted far too much valuable time dedicated to finishing a work that hasn't enriched your knowledge, sparked your imagination or widened your scope of understanding. I don't care how cheap you can buy it...don't."
5,K. puts himself on TRIAL,"I have done a lot of research on Kafka and think can offer someinsight into THE TRIAL which I found to be a brilliant book. The trialthat K. finds himself in is actually taking place in his own mind. Itis his moral consciousness, so long dormant, rising up and judging hislife, his nature, his excess. ...This is not my idea but one that I readabout half way through the novel. The other thing that is so marvelousabout the story is that it lends itself to so many meanings andinterpretations. But take a look at it from this perspective and seeif it opens the tale up for you. I highly recommend Breon Mitchell'snew translation. And for anyone interested in a beautiful biography ofKafka, check out NIGHTMARE OF REASON by Ernst Pawl. It's an incrediblyenlightening journey into the life of this enigmatic genius."
4,"Intriquing, Catchy, But Maybe a Bit Unsatisfying","I cannot claim to be a fan of Kafka,but still I enjoyed this book very much. The book grabs you from the start--the sudden arrest of the main character, Joseph K. for mysterious reasons--and keeps going from there. This central mystery is matched by equally mysterious characters, who like the arrest are unexplainable. This is not your typical novel. The setting seems vague, the characters seem irrational, the plot twists unusual. At one level, all this surrealism is quite enjoyable, amusing, and fascinating. On another level, it can be quite frustrating. You're never quite sure what you're really reading and the resolution, if you can call it that, doesn't feel very resolved at all. Still, after you have finished the book, you may ponder various parts for awhile, never really understanding them completely, but enjoying the search for meaning nevertheless, and isn't that what a good book is supposed to do anyway?"
3,frighteningly prophetic but that can't save it,"It seems that as we look back we see how right Kafka was. He saw the abuse of power that was about to hit Germany as well as the rest of Europe. However, no matter how good of a prophet Kafka may have been The Trial was not the best book I've ever read. Kafka's style of writing grates on the nerves as he takes so long in stating his intentions. The fantastic plot helps but it can not save it."
3,Kafka at his most longwinded.,"The synopsis of the book has been explained in many previous reveiws, so there isn't a point in rehashing that. But, I belive that Kafka's best works are his short stories. He says too much about too little here.This book appeals to pretentious exestentialist types who liketo be wordy about nothing. I enjoy Kafka's shorter things, were everything was succint and crisp. After reading two of the lectures about Truth, Justice & etc. I just skimmed over them.For the scholarly types (which is actually more appropriate than 'prenetious') it may make for an enlightening read; and the plot is a good one, but if you are just getting into Kafka, I definetly do no reccomend this as a first choice. If you are interested in his novels, _Metamorphisis_ (of course...) and _Amerika_ are better ideas."
1,Find Another Translation,This translation is terrible: there are endless typos and ungrammatical sentences. A disgrace. Do not buy this substandard translation. I think Amazon should pull this edition from its website.
2,The writing ruined what could have been an excellent story.,"I shouldn't be reviewing this book, 'cause I never even finished reading it. I couldn't. Maybe my attention span is too short, or maybe the way I read doesn't mesh with Kafka's writing. Either way, I found it impossible to get through. It was boring. I wanted very badly to finish it and find out what happened to K., but it was simply too hard to weed through Kafka's verbose style (well, maybe not Kafka himself. His writing could have been lost in the translation, but I somehow doubt that). Maybe I'll try reading it again when I'm really wired, for the plotline is not one to be missed."
1,in one word: horrible,"possibly the most boring and pointless book ever written. anyone interested in existentialism, read The Stranger by camus. its 10 times better and not to long."
1,pointless dumb story!!!!!,"I had to read this for extra credit, only that!! I was totally bored with this. it was meaningless, had no real point, confusing and maybe just plain stupid. sorry to say, but I barely managed to finish it I don't truly see what was so great about this book."
2,Not exactly coherent,"Yes, it's Kafka, which is nice--he's fun to read. Still, you can tell that he didn't quite get this up to snuff; it's just hard to tell where he's going with everything. It seems like each chapter is a short story, and if you go into it like that, then you might be happy with the entirety. If you go into it like a novel, you won't be happy with the overall picture, themes, and the like--just not really there."
2,Boring after the first half of the book.,There is no doubt Kafka is a brillant writer. But this is and endless book after the first half were it draws you in and spits you out for ever
3,I prefer Albert Camus -- less sterile symbolism there,"Kafka's peculiar brand of existentialism proved a bit overly abstruse and symbolic. The elements of this puzzling allegory that I did try to interpret - the religious framework in which Kafka seemed to always place his philosophy, his obsession with the Law metaphor, his terror at being unable to find that ultimate Law it represented - ultimately proved not so much incomprehensible as completely alien to me. Yes, God is scary and powerful precisely because we can't get access to him. So what? I would have preferred less of the complicated allusions to Laws and Castles and more detailed exploration of the author's views -- like in Camus's _myth of Sisyphus_."
3,"Beware, the size of the book!","This book is large. Not in terms of pages, but in dimensions. This is not a complaint because the product dimensions are actually mentioned in the details. Nonetheless, as it is so unusual to have a book like this, the size of a coffee table book, I obviously hadn't considered it, and was somewhat disappointed when it arrived. I would have preferred a standard size book for a novel."
4,A very compelling novel,"Although, the novel can be hard to understand at times, it attracted my attention right from the start. It starts off with a bang, with Joseph K. getting arrested in the first chapter. This is a very good novel, but it is not a novel that is recommended by everyone. It is also not an excessively addictive story. The novel is very suspenseful also. Even though the reader and K. never figure out why he is arrested in the first place, it is an overall good book. The only con about the novel is that the novel itself, as well as some chapters, are never completed. It also contains underlying polical information. I would recommend this book to all Kafka's fans and anyone interested in a suspenseful and court-set novel."
3,The Trial,"Not a fun read, more like a nightmare. The ""hero"" and the reader are contiually frustrated as he progressess toward the cliff with little hope in sight."
3,A Trial,"After being enthralled with many of Kafka's short works, especially the parable ""Before the Law"" contained herein, I was extremely disappointed, and dare I say, bored with The Trial. It is not until K's Conversation with the priest in the cathedral leading up to ""Before the Law"" does the book become interesting. Sure, the book is philosophically brilliant, but the unbroken streams of dialog resulting in laboriously long paragraphs, combined with an impotent narrator and lifeless prose result in a tenouous grip on the reader's interest. The lifeless prose may initially be attributed to translation but familiarity with Goethe and Remark and their lyrical mastery of language seem to defy this. Due to his position as Everyman the lack of character development in K. is certainly understood but it is yet one more factor that contributes to making The Trial an unsatisfactory read."
4,Kafka's Wieeeeeerd!,"Franz Kafka was a bit odd. He only published his short stories in his lifetime, and requested that his novels be burned after his death. Thank God his friend had them published instead.This short novel ""The Trial"" is unfinished, but it seems finished. It's his second and last novel. I think they're both technically unfinished, actually. Anyway, in this novel ""The Trial"", a man named Joseph K. is charged and arrested, but he never knows what he's been charged with or why he's been arrested. And one absurdity follows another. This tale is a powerful warning and the logical extreme of what bureaucracy can look like when wedded to totalitarianism. He never sees a judge, never appears in a high court, yet at his trial he was convicted and that's that!? He is executed by officials, chased down and killed like a dog in the street.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
2,LIKE A DOG? i dont get it...LIKE A DOG?,"what did he mean""like a dog""? can someone please help me...this statement's been haunting me since...since...since!"
2,Engrossing but Empty,"I tend to like psychological books such as this, the exploration of human nature, whatever. I don't need a lot of action, in fact I'd prefer otherwise- I'd much rather have some in depth character development. On that account, this book is massively successful. There are few book that delve so thoroughly into the mindset of one character. The problem is, I never feel like there's a significant development or transformation of Josef's character. Each time he seems on the verge of enlightenment or personal realization, the narration turns to a new mundane description or detail. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did. No major plot occurence. No major character development. I hardly empathised with Josef because Kafka never gives you a real reason to. In the end, you're not really sure what the Trial was, but you don't care either."
1,"Very, very disturbing book","This is the most depressing book I've ever read. From the moment it starts to the very last page, there isn't one pleasing image. After I finished reading it, I felt like burnig this book. Books like this may introduce concepts in our brains, but this is one that will give you nightmares for days. I think I am different now, after reading this book, in a very negative way. It gives you a different, and a frightening, persepective on life. I think that my life has become worse after reading this book."
2,Unfinished Mess,"First of all, none of the reviews I have seen here mention that this book was not finished or that Kafka never meant for it to be published. This first draft is an unclear mess. The premise is fine and I suppose it has some interesting philosophical ideas but it fails as a novel. The book is frustrating because it might have actually been a great one if it had been finished and rewritten. From what I can tell, the draft we have here is less than half the length of what the finished product might have been.If you want to read a confusing first draft that ends abruptly this is the book for you. If you want to see Kafka at his best check out some of his short stories."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"I picked up this book on my travel through Latin-Amercia a few years ago. Left it with a friend, and just recently got it back. I had been looking forward to read it for a long time, but I was not at all impressed. ""The Trial"" is a book that was just that, a trial, and it gave me nothing but frustration. What saved me for feeling that it had been a total waste of time, was that Kafka have created some interesting characters and the, at times, beautiful language. The rest gave me grey hair.Try something else of Kafka's work. Other novels must be better than this one."
2,Not the best,"I love and respect Kafka, but this story was difficult to read. It was like being in a dream, or hearing someone try and describe a dream with bits and pieces missing. I had to read it for a law school class, but never would choose to read this on my won or for fun. If you love Kafka try the Metamorphosis"
3,A Trial.,"This introspective allegory, infused with surrealism, jumps from reality to dreamlike or imagined sequences. The work is unfinished and this accounts for the obvious gaps, and the fact that it is nowhere near as well crafted as the brilliant ""metamorphosis"", a short work which makes many of the same points in a much more polished manner. It is a bit of a trial to read this work, but it does provide a window into Kafka's creative process."
5,exactly what is says in the title.,I am very happy with this book. Its is just what I was looking for and has been very helpful.
1,Much Smaller than Stated,"This Garter belt is Much Smaller than implied by the measurements. The XX-Large size is supposed to be from ""45 to 48 inches"". When the velcro is fastened at it's largest, the belt measures 38 inches. Yes, it will stretch to 45"", but it's not at all comfortable when stretched 7 or more inches.An EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING Product."
1,not so good,I bought the garter belt when I had to wear high-compression support hose following vein surgery. This product did not worn for thee high-compression stockings. The clipswere inadequate and would not stay fasened.
3,duro-med garter belt,"Did not notice it only came in one size, (small). As a male with leg circulation problems, I need to wear thigh high support hose and have trouble keeping them up. I have not been able to find anything with big enough or heavy enough clasps to hold them up. Would have liked the more manly looking garter belt to fill my needs, but need a larger size. The picture looked like it would have been the right thing. Hopefully they will come out with larger sizes, and either a nude or dark blue color to be less noticeable on men. AL"
2,Terrible,"I actually liked 90125, while it wasn't ""Yes"" it was still a decent album, but Big Generator was just terrible...with the exception of one or two songs, this entire album represented the very worst of Yes. Union wasn't great but it was certainly an improvement from this."
2,A very bad album from a great band,"With Drama and Tormato, this cd wins the contest for the worst music made by this amazing band. This is a very bad follow up for 90125.I like only three songs on this cd, ""Rythm of Love"", ""Shoot high, Aim low"" and ""Love will find a way""""Almost like love"" and ""I'm running"" are serious possible winners for the worst song, But yes will raise again and will produce some very good release in a near future. (See some of my other reviews)"
1,Cacaphony Personified,"In fact this is the first Yes album I listened to as Yes was recommended by one of my friends that had same musical interests as mine and it was quite a traumatic experience.Rest assured I am a fan of other Progressive bands such as Tull,King Crimson,Gentle Giant etc.I think the major problem with yes is Jon anderson's vocals which I feel is more suitable for pop music.Also the music seems to be extremely pretentitious and artificial lacking any sense of direction or harmony.There is a mishmash of pop,classical and hard rock and these are blended incoherently unlike other prog bands that I mentioned above,thus resulting in cacaphony.Of course, it has one decent number(shoot high,aim low)where the guital work is excellent.Now, I have come to believe that Yes is one of the most overrated bands in the prog rock circuit.Rest assured, progressive rock can't get worse than this."
4,Didn't the 80's suck?,"In the 80's Jon took a back seet to a more pop style of rock and Yes paid the price. This album hints at the Yes we know and love but only in some parts and is killed in the chanting of BIG GENERATOR!! Its annoying at some times but a good album and is a good attempt to reclaim respect. If you want this album get 90125, they are the two albums that are very close in sound. If you like the 'Jon' version of Yes, they got good when they released 'Talk'. 'Union' was too flashy for Jon and should have waited untill ABWH released another album."
2,For 90125 Fans only...,"This album, as has been previously stated, does contain some excellent production, but it suffers strongly from a desire to explore the Yesyears of the 70's mixed with the Rabin-pop influence of the 90's. Shoot High Aim Low is fairly moving despite the fact that Jon Anderson's vocal style contrasts sharply with Rabin's. It is pretty obvious however that the band was fated to go downhill once more after 90125, and considering Rabin's now dated guitar style (he's better off continuing with his soundtrack compositions)-this was bound to happen anyway."
2,"No sir, don't like it!","With a nod to those who can appreciate Big Generator in it's own right, without preconceptions about what to expect from this bunch of musicians, I have to say this one's like being invited to dinner at Julia Child's house only to have her serve you macaroni & cheese. She has the right to serve you whatever she wants, but considering who your dealing with you were probably expecting a LITTLE BIT MORE! I mean to say, if I wanted elegant-sounding pop music I'd listen to Abba. But, hey, it's still better than Hall & Oates, right?"
1,Why buy the album?,If you actually take the time to look at the pricing you can save $.07 by buying the songs individually. This makes no sense to me.
4,A dated classic...,"While half the album is firmly rooted in the eighties, all the songs are polished and solid. Certainly my favorite tracks are Final Eyes and Holy Lamb (why are so many put off by this song? Enjoy the beautiful music and listen to the lyrics!), but I can put this CD in and enjoy every song. A must have for those of us with a musical taste for the late eighties, although several of the songs transcend any era."
3,"Nice try guys, BUT...","The album wasn't quite inspired enough. The title track is excellent -- if anything should have been released as a single, it should have been ""Big Generator"" because it's closest in spirit to ""Owner of a Lonely Heart."" ""Rhythm of Love,"" one of the album's singles, isn't so bad, but ""Love Will Find a Way"" sounds somehow trite to these ears. There are some gems buried here -- ""I'm Running,"" despite sub-par vocal harmony, was a pretty good song, and ""Shoot High, Aim Low"" was justifiably Trevor's song on the album, and the raw emotion in the songwriting of ""Holy Lamb"" forgives the rather tepid arrangement -- but then we have ""Almost Like Love,"" a sonic experiment gone tragically wrong. ""Big Generator"" was probably half a great album. It wasn't enough. I give this only three stars out of five; if it hadn't had its last two songs I probably would have given it two."
3,"Of the three Rabin-Yes albums, this one is the worst","Not that the album is bad...it is just not as good quality as ""90125"" and ""Talk."" ""Shoot High Aim Low,"" and ""Love Will Find a Way"" are the only two really good songs on this album. ""Rhythm of Love"" is average, but the rest is just not as good. Not really worth the time. Better to get those three songs on the YesYears box set instead of getting the album."
3,A lukewarm sophomore effort from the Rabin-era Yes,"Let's face it, this was the first true collaboration between Rabin and Anderson. When Jon Anderson joined Yes for 90125 the album was nearly finished and his involvement was limited.On this album, you can hear Anderson's contributions loud and clear. ""Holy Lamb"" is pure Anderson...and you can almost hear Rabin giving a sigh while strumming through it.The album does have some fine moments. ""Shoot High Aim Low"" is a masterpiece with excellent guitar work from Rabin. ""Final Eyes"", ""Love Will Find A Way"" and ""I'm Running"" also offer up some very good melodies and playing.However, ""Rhythm Of Love"", the title track and ""Almost Like Love"" are almost excercises in self-parody. The chorus' are over the top and the playing is nothing extraordinary. This is something that would continue with ""Talk"" which has practically no good songs whatsover...but that's another story."
2,For Rabin fans only,"Wild sounds, great production, forgettable songs at best, awful at worst (""Song for the Harmonic Convergence"" competes hard for the worst title).Rabin fans will find stuff of interest. Others should stick to 90125"
2,"The ""new"" Yes gets old","Yes's previous album, ""90125"" breathed new life into the old band and pointed them in a harder edged and more pop oriented direction. Unfortunately, the new approach runs out of steam on the follow up. ""Big Generator"" is reminiscent of the band's worst traits of the late 1970's, most of which resulted from mediocre songwriting. Without good hooks to hang on, the lyrical pretensions become annoying, the techno-wizzadry begins to try the patience and lead singer John Anderson's voice begins to grate on the nerves. This album spelled the end of the line for the ""90125""-version of Yes."
2,PLease...,"I'd like to know how I should utilize the 4 CD one the same as the other that arrived me. Maybe there's something ""technical"" I dont't know for the same 4.Regards from Mario F. Prelz[...]"
2,Rabin & Horn lose control - and it shows,"A dismal album, thanks in no small part to the return of Jon Anderson as principal lyricist. What made 90125 stand out among Yes offerings was Anderson's limited involvement; Chris Squire and Trevor Rabin penned many of the songs (with limited input from Anderson), and the album shot to number 1. Unfortunately, Anderson is back behind the pen for BG, and it shows - typically awful prose streaming from Anderson, coupled with an oblique, flashback-to-flower-children mentality (""Song for the Harmonic Convergence"") reduces this album to a shadow of what it could have been. Rabin tries his best, but the mish-mosh result is a clear ""one step forward, five steps back"" return the over-indulgent early 70s sound."
2,Mediocre effort,This just lacks the usual you would expect from YES. Only two good cuts and the rest are disappointing. Their first 3 efforts were their absolute best.
1,VINDICATION,"I agree this was not Yes, and this was a big disapointment as big a disapointment as John Kaye and Steppenwolf's POP and Roll drebles but not as bad as Heart's Dead Animals. YUCK DREAK Bad Pop not even Soft Rock, or Wuss Rock, heck not even rock & roll. There are no Wonderous Stories here. IF you like Pop Spider Friends Go For it Other wise blECh."
2,This is not Yes,"Big Generator is not a bad record, but it does not have what I like about Yes: complex, interesting compositions unlike any other rock music. Instead the pieces are short, relatively simple and arranged like most popular music; they even fade out instead making a proper ending. Iunderstand that people and groups evolve, but do they have to give up everything that made them special? Two stars for putting the Yes label on this music."
2,Pitiful failure,"Yes is one of my favorite groups and this album hardly belongs to the group, who wrote Close to the Edge and Tales from the Topographic Oceans... probably there is only one good song there which is Shoot High, Aim Low, but technically this album is a typical representative of 80s pop music... a very great downfall for Yes and 2 stars I put just for my love for the group."
4,Rhythm's I love.,"Besides the fact that this is only 8 songs long, and the cover reminds me of something Duran Duran would do, this is really good stuff. I actually like this era of Yes as much as any other, and the hits hold up even today. ""Rhythm Of Love"" is as catchy as it ever was, and ""Love Will Find A Way"" is impossible not to like as well. The rest is all great too, my other favorite being ""Shoot High Aim Low"", mellow and dramatic. Anyone who likes ""90125"" should dig this also."
4,Still going strong.,"Big Generator"" #15 (1987).11th studio album ""Big Generator"", is a fairly good follow up to 1983's ""90125"". They still produced mega hits in, the fabulous ""Love Will Find A Way"", #1 MSR, #30 hot 100, ""Rhythm Of Love"", #2 MSR, #40 hot 100, one of my personal favorite Yes songs, the progressive ""Shoot High, Aim Low"", #11 MSR, this song should still be on all playlist's, it's that good. Their final hit was ""Final Eyes"" #20 MSR. The title track and ""I'm Running"" were good numbers also. Rabin, Anderson, Squire, White and Kaye did a good job here, they got back together in 1991 for ""Union"", with Steve Howe and Bill Bruford."
4,andrews choice,All was as expected and was glad to get it in time for christmas. Happy New year and great success Thanks
1,This album was never officially released,"You may be able to find a copy that slipped out of the hands of a reviewer, or download the songs from the Internet, but No Fear never made it to stores and never will.Essentially Abra pulled the album at the last minute over creative differences with J Records owner Miles Davis (that being the label that was to release the album). No Fear was to be considerably poppier in the Britney Spears/Christina Aguilera vein, and in the end Ms. Moore decided not to do it. Given how the same move worked (or rather, didn't) for Liz Phair, it was probably a wise choice.About half of this material has been reworked and put onto her next release, Everything Changed."
5,An incredible digital remaster,"California '99 is unique to the early '70's. This Jimmie Haskell concept album is, needless to say, one of a kind. The Joe Walsh songs alone are worth the price of admission. After nearly 40 years, I never imagined I would be able to get a CD of this production with all of the bizarre album paraphenalia included. This is a Geffin product, so I can only guess he had a particular fondness for it, and went to the expense of recreating it for those who had appreciated the original. The audio quality is simply incredible.If you are a fan of Jimmie, Joe, or both, this one's a keeper. Further confirmation that Walsh took a step down when he joined the Eagles.Not cheap, but well worth it for a certain group of fans."
5,"Wierd and trippy little record, only the 60's could have produced this.","I got the Japan import mini lp of this because I usually dig anything related to Mr. Jimmie Haskell, who is SORELY under-represented on cd.(Bootlegs aside) He's always a little on the kooky side but California 99 outdoes any I have heard to date. (Tho his lp ""Countdown"" is right up there with this)...California 99 is a bizarre mix of a George Orwell 1999ish storyline and real trippy jazz/pop music. If you like cool and strange stuff this is way up there. Leave it to the Japanese to pick up on this freaky little masterpiece for a proper re-issue. I really love this record."
4,The Devil's Novice,Wonderful movie. Period details are amazing. Keeps you guessing until the very end.
2,No direction,"I don't know what these other people got out of this book. I am a DM student in voice and have had to read over 37 books on pedagogy, including this one, and this one seems to be one of the weaker ones. Yes, the content is all factual, but it is poorly organized and it is hard to follow. There are so many other books out there that are a whole lot better. I was amazed that so many people lauded the book. I'm sorry I have to be a naysayer but I thought you all might like an other opinion."
2,"Good performance, horrible studio recording work","The material is quite experimental, very fast, open and energetic. Watts keeps the time almostwith toms to create a personal atmosphere and effect, usually quite dark and aggressive.The reed solos are long and strong even if sometimes a bit too much repetitive.My BIG concern is the recording work: there's an absolute imbalance in the instruments, withan unbelievable loud drums hiding the bass and the reeds. I can't understand why in 1996 in a studiosetting people aren't able to mix 3 instruments properly. I could not enjoy this record, even a goodequalizer can't do much from this bad mixing. A big disappoint from a great artist like Brandford."
2,Zenith Antenna Single Amplifier Doesn't Do Much,"The Zenith antenna signal amplifier is designed for the Gemini ZHDTV1 HDTV-UHF Digital Indoor Antenna. I have the Gemini antenna and it works fine alone with the DISH 811 satellite receiver. I gambled on the Zenith amplifier and lost. If the Zenith antenna amplifier works, the improved effect on reception is so marginal I could not notice it. I have found that elevating the front of the indoor antenna's base on a VHS tape or similar support, skewing the angle of the antenna, improves reception more than just moving the antenna laterally. You need to plug this amplifier in an outlet, than turn a thin cylindrical plastic adjustment extension clockwise to increase gain. This device did not work for me. The Gemini indoor UHF antenna is another story, it is the next best thing to an outdoor antenna."
3,Works Great,I can't complain. I got at least 10% boost in signal which is exactly what I needed on most channels
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting something great, and I didn't get it with this antenna. My reception was improved marginally, I got no extra channels (I still only have ONE channel). To make it worse, I now have to constantly adjust the antenna; I cannot go through one thirty-minute sitcom without having to get up and readjust the thing. Very annoying. I would not recommend spending money on this antenna. You would do just as good with some old-fashioned rabbit ears."
2,Are My Eyes Deceiving Me?,"I expected to some some significant improvement in my signal. It was hardly noticeable. Hey Dad, does this look any better to you? See what I mean."
2,Worst Chem E book ever,The book is difficult to read to say the least. I found myself going back to the appendix 4 or 5 times for just understanding the beginnings of fluids. the use of linear algebra is heavy and the homework is imposible unless you have a very solid background in undergrad transport.
4,Enjoyed my first transaction,"Buying Analysis of Transport Phenomena by William Deen from AB Media was my first transaction on Amazon. Apart from getting the book at a cheap rate, it also arrived on time. Looking forward to more purchases from Amazon."
5,Awesome!,Timely delivered. Awesome book! Love it! This book is very good compared to any other book available for transport phenomena.Some of the chapters are hard to follow because of short cut derivations and such!
5,"Nice case, nice size, nice price","Made for the PSP but great for a wide variety of uses including digital camera, digital video camera, glasses and more.Made of neoprene (or like) material with foamed rubber sides for added flexibility. Ring makes it easy to operate the velcroed lid. Offers some padded protection.Inside you'll find not only the main compartment but there's also a separate pocket, zipered which can be used as a secondary storage area on it's own or within it there are also two individual storage sleeves; very versatile.This is also great for hiking, camping, vacationing to carry things like money, cards, glasses, medication, well you get the idea.On the back there's a belt loop (velcroed so you don't have to take your belt on and off to wear the case) and also a Karabiner.Inside dimensions are 6.5""x1""x3""."
5,Handy,These little sheets are very handy when added to my planner. Try the pastel version also. Soft Hues File Pockets -- Portable
1,Bad Lighter!,"This is not a lighter you want to purchase. It won't light if there is even a touch of wind, and when the cap is open it lets lighter fluid out rapidly so it drains really fast. It was outperformed by my .99 gas station disposable lighter during the three days I used it. Garbage. The compass is a nice touch however!"
3,Average,The book's plot was not original; character development could have been better. Suspense was lacking all the way through. Books by former Peace Corps volunteers tend to be more insightful than books by former Foreign Service Officers since Peace Corps volunteers were closer to the mainstream population as oppposed to the 'power elite'. The setting of the book is apropos of current events in this region.
3,"I""M not finished yet...",I not only have the book but also the cd of the book and haven't finished either. Can't give a good or bad rating.. but it is history and her version so I will think of it as such. It's just not captivating for me for some reason.
3,Works fine but found it to be a bit noisy,"I installed this in my multi-amp home audio system, was able to tweak levels, xover points to get good and satisfying sound; but one disappointing thing is the s/n ratio. This is a bit on the noisy side with no audio playing you can here a hisssssssssss.I think most people wouldn't notice, but I'm pretty picky. My previous crossover was a Rane AC23 that was super clean; but that is a $300 crossover, not an $89 unit. Should have kept the Rane, bit was was overkill for my application.For what it is, this Nady unit seems plenty heavy duty. The AC plugs directly into it and doesn't need a power brick like a lot of gear does (hate those!)I think the difference is this unit is a 12db/octive and the Rane I had was a 24db/octive. Much more gain above the noise floor."
1,Worthless!,"The cartridge lid was difficult to pry off despite the tool provided. Once opened, the cratridge WAS easy to refill with the ink's applicator tips. However, the real trouble began once the cartridge was filled and the lid successfully replaced. The ink continuously leaked from the bottom of the cartridge, causing it to spread all over the printed wiring cable. (This after I left it sitting on several layers of paper towels for 15 minutes.) When I returned the cartridge to my printer, the ink continued to leak, and got all over the inside of my printer. Now, when I hit print, the printer goes through it's usual workings, but produces a blank sheet of paper. I believe the leaky ink may have ruined the wiring cable inside the printer.Don't buy these refill products! They are not worth the money, headache, hassle, or mess!"
1,Garbage!,Save your money and don't buy this worthless refill kit. I tried it and after following the directions I was never able to get any decent printing out of the refilled cartridge and had to go and buy an HP replacement cartridge. I wish Amazon.com would quit carrying it to prevent anyone else from wasting their money. If they had 0 stars that is what I would give this product it is nothing more than a piece a garbage which is where it and the cartridge I tried to reuse ended up.
1,Did not work with my printer,"I thought I would save some money buying this cartridge, but it did not work with my printer. It might have worked the first day, but is no longer working. What a pain. I just trashed it and ordered the regular HP cartridge. What a waste of money."
4,Just as good as the real thing,The Black Replacement Cartridge from Dadaproducts works just like the Hewlett Packard cartridge you buy for double the price. Great buy!
4,Classic Pulp At Its Finest!!!,"If you're the type of reader that loves a good mystery/suspense story, gear up for this 1930's yarn from L. Ron Hubbard's Golden Stories. This has all the elements to keep you reading and about as many twists and turns as the raging sea where the bulk of the story takes place. Good characters, high-action and a classic hero....of course, what else would one want from good pulp?!!"
4,Above most people's head!,"As the experienced martial artist will realize from the silly review that was posted for this title, this is for the experienced swordsman rather than the juvenile martial arts (Bruce Lee) movie fan.The video shows the complete sword method taught at the Japanese Imperial Army's Toyama Military Academy from 1925 until around 1945, with kata and applications (bunkai) so it's really difficult to understand how the reviewer who claimed they were not there, missed them.This is not a ""pretty"" fanciful style of swordsmanship, no back flips, handstands, or flaming swords doused in gasoline to please a crowd. In other words it won't win points in ""open circuit"" competitions but it is a truly effective fighting method that was used on the battlefield with devastating effect in the Pacific Theater as late as 1944.Essential for the serious swordsman/collector!John Edwards, Editor,Dragon Times Magazine."
2,A Disappointment,"After reading the previous review I was under the impression that this was a comprehensive instructional video on Japanese sword technique. Instead, it is 50 minutes of a man with a pot belly swinging his katana and bokken. There is no 'bunkai', only one episodee of 'kumitachi', and the techniques used are nothing to write home about. Anyone with a basic understanding of kenjutsu or kendo will find this video a waste of time. Save your money and buy Dave Lowry's book titled ""Bokken."" You'll learn a lot more for a lot less! I did give this video two stars because I got a kick out of the swingin' 70's white pants and see-through shirt which were worn throughout the video!!"
2,unimaginative criticism,"Longenbach's approach to ""modern poetry after modernism"" (I put it in quotes because of the disservice he does to his topic) represents one of the most conservative, unimaginative, and predictable accounts of modern poetry after modernism. He focuses on the usual suspects, ignores our more radical poets (though Ashbery is/was radical, he's become a tired topic for critics), and invites some of the poets he writes about to blurb his poetry book. If this smells like careerism, the book's lack of substance will corroborate the odor."
3,"Interesting Book, Interesting Concept","Interesting little self-help book. Takes some of the old self-help cliches and modernizes them to fit into today's paradigm. Personally, I didn't get much out of it, but it seems to be a very positive book focused on proactive methods towards building a better mindset to deal with today's world. While I may not have liked it much, you might enjoy it quite a bit."
1,the warrior poet,"While the Chinese may have invented the Warrior Poet, it was left to one Roy Flanders of Nantucket to refine and transform this concept into that of the Bartender Poet.His Book, which is mostly the highly indulgent morning-after yawps of a (self proclaimed) stud muffin, is so unbelievably tedious the reader will have to be drunk, badly hung over, or high himself to get through more than a few turgid pages.Imagine the Saturday Night Live segment ""Deep Thoughts"" but imagine the writer taking himself very seriously. However, you will howl with laughter at this conceit as you endeavor, gamely, to trudge through this tripe.Someone should inform Roy that simply typing drivel in a form that sort of looks like it might be poetic does not transform the drivel into poetry nor does it make the typist a poet.On the positive side, if recidivistic drunk driving offenders in detox were forced to memorize this trash, they would never drink again."

It would certainly eliminate recidivistic drunk driving."
3,Not the Best of Serendipity,"Well, first off, Shimmeree is actually a winged mare, not a dragon. She lives inside a water droplet and her world is only ever silver, blue, and gold. That is until a speck of dust, brown, brings in a seed that blooms with other colours. An interesting work, but somewhat lacking in the beauty and psuedo-reality of the other books. A personal preference of mine, maybe, also the vivid colourings can be very distracting to young ones, especially at bedtime. To be fair I really do love almost all the other serendipity books."
2,Not thrilled.,I didn't feel as though this worked as advertised. It's okay for shaper. but I've had others I like much better.
5,The Best,I love this stuff! I use this product 2-3 times a day. I have very dry skin and my cuticles crack and bleed. After using this for even a few days the cracking is gone and my fingers have never been in a better condition.
2,No support!,"The book is well written and organized. However, the software that came with the book (one of the main reasons I ordered the book) was difficult to use and had little to no support. I am a software engineer and could not get some of the programs to run after installation. Also, the websites that were listed for troubleshooting help were no longer valid."
2,"Please pass, trust me.","Good intention, but script was weak, and actors were not exactly compatible with each other, as well as with the characters they were assigned. Life is too short not to pass. Many dialogues were like cliche, not to mention that there are quite a few good movies on bad cops already in the market."
1,A couple of Hollywood's best actors talent wasted!,"Some great actors playing in a very poor cut rate movie. Don't waste your time. Pick up a good book, you'll be much better time spent. The only bright note was some shorts clips of a couple good songs."
2,straight to DVD turkey,"There is a reason why this movie was not released in theater. The story sounds engaging...corrupt cops and an young aspiring journalist out to expose innercity crimes. The script however was poorly written, production executed worse. Even Hollywood heavy hitters, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, were not able to save the film. Both are off the screen most of the time. Surprisingly, Justin Timberlake is more than competent. It may be a start of a promising film career."
3,Got this for the people in it,"As another reviewer points out one-by-one, there are good actors here yet none save this film and make it strongly worth watching. Seems like a bad script/story-line. For example, there are exchanges between Timberlake and Freeman that I liked, but far too little of this other places. There is actually some nice cinematography in places as well, like when Timberlake reads over a court transcript and the witnesses show up under the transcript in black and white saying the lines Timberlake's finger is moving over down the page. So I have given the film a 3-star rating for things like this. Other things like the bad guys being so one-dimensional, just make me feel I cannot do better when combined with other things. For example, I could not connect some of the background songs (like Donovan and Hendrix) to the action when it is playing. (Sure...Freeman's character is from the 60s so he could be listening to this sort of music, but why any music at all?)"
3,"edison ""effort""","edison force was ok. with a bigger budget and maybe a better director this movie could have been a lot better. Acting wasn't too bad but looking at the cast you almost expected something ten times better. the violence was pretty high as was the action, for this reason i gave it the 3 star rating."
5,Mature Second Novel,This narrative broaches some very difficult and often uncomfortable subjects. Eudenides style of writing is very easy to read and does not leave the reader uncomfortable at all. Rather than be appalled or heartbroken over the main characters' strife I found myself interested and wanting to continue reading.Don't be put off by the strange subject matter. This is is beautiful coming of age novel which proves that change is possible at any time in life.
2,Too many tangents,I was possibly disappointed in this book because I thought it was going to be about intergender challenges. Although parts of the book does deal with this issue it goes off on so many intricate but unrelated tangents that the intergender thing seems secondary. I resorted to a lot of speed reading in order to finish the book.
5,loved it,I had been putting off reading this for a couple years because I usually don't like Oprah's Book Club picks but I am so glad I finally read it.
4,Middlesex,AWESOME. Mind opener. Captivating. Heart touching. What an imagination. beautifully written. I felt I was in that era. Surprising Ending.
2,100 Words or Less,"This was a case of heightened expectations crashing into the blah reality. I loved ""Virgin Suicides."" So, I ripped into this new novel with relish. Wow, was I disappointed.I adore Eugenides' writing, even in this novel; however, I was bored by the plot and characters. I slogged through the first 100+ pages, trying to wade past the grandparents' history, hoping that it would pick up. Nope. With each page my interest peeled away.This was so disappointing. Reluctantly I finally decided to give up."
4,Middlesex Review - David,"I read this book for a bookclub and generally enjoyed it. I learned a lot about hermaphrodites which was interesting but I felt like the ending was the author getting tired of writing on the subject. It seemed to wonder around not really knowing how to end the story. The characters were drawn out well and the writing was excellent in word usage.All in all, an enjoyable novel which allowed me to learn something about a topic I knew nothing about before."
2,Hard to get into,"This book was confusing and slow. When I got to the middle it finally started to pick up. I did not care for the main character, Cal. I found the most interesting characters to be the first generation grandparents who were siblings. Overall, it was interesting and decent, but I would not read it if I had to do it again.I selected this book because of the reviews and was ultimately disappointed. I read a lot, and typically whiz through every book. It took me almost 2 weeks to get through this. Do not read this if you are looking for something easy or a page-turner."
3,"I enjoyed it, but it took some effort.","Some sections of this novel are entirely engrossing and beautiful. But, I did find myself not terribly concerned about what happened. I'm familiar with LGBTI issues and I can understand that, for those who find this territory unsettling and challenging, it is illuminating and interesting. I so much wanted to know more about the narrator and his/her experience and I was frustrated that that became a minor theme in the book. The opening section in Cyprus/Turkey was mesmerizing, but I found myself thinking that this was more of a novelty than a true exploration of intesex or hermaphrodite people. Eugindes is a great story-teller, but I had to push myself to get through the book. (We'll see what my book group thinks when we meet to discuss this later this month.) Not bad by any means, but, I feel, targeted to those in the mainstream who don't usually encounter people of ""aberrant"" orientations. But, that's just me."
2,Too much unnecessary detail,"I read this book because I have a strong interest in genetics and thought a novel about a hermaphrodite would be pretty interesting... Unfortunately, I found the book unnecessarily long winded and for the most part I was just waiting for it to end. Eugenides devotes the entire first half of the book to the history of his grandparents, which, while necessary to understand how this mutation got passed down, was far too detailed and I found it quite boring. He also goes back and forth between the past and the present which can be a bit confusing. Maybe it is just me and maybe it's because I am 25, but this book was disappointing and the most interesting part to me was the short bit where Cal is getting tests done in NYC."
3,Great issues to discuss at book club - but way too long,"Our book club had a great time discussing this - wow, incest, gender, gender identity, etc. - however we agreed the book would've been better if done in 300 pages or less."
4,Very good,"I really enjoyed this book but strangely enough enjoyed it a lot more while I was reading it than I have since I've finished. I have found that I really haven't even thought about it at all since I finished the last page and that's too bad. I like to take something with me after the book goes back to the library's shelves.Cal's story (along with the story of his entire family) took a lot of different twists and turns. It was funny, sad, scary, happy, confusing, and tiring. That's life....Cal's just had a twist. J.E. does a good job delivering what I think would be believable happenings. His writing was extremely easy to read and full of great imagery. Like a previous reviewer wrote, his city descriptions were dead on.This is the first book I've read by Eugindes and while it didn't leave me begging for more I am still planning on reading ""The Virgin Suicides"". I recommend it without hesitation."
4,middlesex,we as a bookclub is really enjoying the book and we see all the differances in people lives and the condition of the book was good
3,Having loved The Virgin Suicides was looking forward to Middlesex,"I had high hopes for this book. I loved The Virgin Suicides! Living in the Detroit area, I could connect with ""Suicides"". In my opinion, Middlesex is a dull read. I had a very difficult time getting though the book."
3,Not what it's cracked up to be...,"I had such high hopes for this book based on what reviews were given on Amazon and what the subject matter was, and I guess in a way it delievered, but it gave so much more that wasn't interesting to me, it seemed to be a waste of my time.I'm not one to quickly give up on books, but if it gets to the point to where I feel I'm wasting my life away hoping for something that will never come, I have to close it. This was one of those."
2,The Middlesex Suicides,"Thank goodness I borrowed this from a library instead of paying good money to purchase it. It picks up in the second half, the first half being devoted to to the (tedious) family history.I wonder how many readers were prompted to commit suicide through when reading this boring and tedious tome.?sorry Jeffrey, boooooring!!"
2,Boring,"I was really excited when I got this book because of the great reviews that received on Amazon. When I started reading it, I became really annoyed because the author continuously interrupted the story to narrate a mini story or a historical fact that didn't felt relevant to the main story. After awhile, I started skipping paragraphs and pages but I didn't finished the book. I went to wikipedia and read how it ends. I'm glad I didn't continue reading it."
3,Slow Delivery,"The book was in good condition, but it took 11 days to arrive from the date it shipped and there was no tracking number provided."
1,Overrated - disappointment.,"Once again I am confused as to how this book got such great reviews - I couldn't read past page 50. It was a painful story about a screwed up person, no real plot and unlikeable characters."
1,utter trash,"Cloying, smarmy, not nearly as well-written as it thinks it is - nothing but tabloid titillation wrapped up in high-art pretension. Embarrassingly bad. Go read Manuel Kundera, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nikolas Katzankis, or just admit you want to read trash and pick up some Anne Rice. This in-between garbage that takes itself so seriously will give you a bad mental state for several days. I feel guilty for even finishing this book, I disliked it so much."
3,Didn't hold my interest,"Well, I must admit I stopped reading around page 100. The writing was excellent and I liked the basic idea of the novel, but it didn't hold my attention. The plot and characters simply were not compelling enough to pull me forward through 500 pages. I think there is a certain egocentricity to authors (male) who write big books like this one. THEY are interested in everything they say, so we readers should be, too. I prefer a novel like Carol Shields ""Unless."" At around 200 pages, it never flagged and the author didn't stuff it with extraneous details, historical oddities or long digressions."
4,Naomi Berman-Potash book review,"I enjoyed this book; and found it very thought provoking. Although it was incredbily interesting, it was often very depressing. Nevertheless, I would recommend it for the historical content and social commentary."
3,"A Great Read, but---",What super writing skill Eugenides displays for us. His narrative is compelling all the way. The characters are interesting.but I was glad to leave them after so many days of living their tortured lives. This is not one of those books I would want to spend my eyesight on if I thought I would have only a few more years of reading ability.
1,Boring!,"Recommended by a ""friend"". Got 1/4 into it and gave up - couldn't stay awake. Seriously? Incest stories about the protagonist's grandmother is what makes good reading these days? No thanks."
2,A disappointing read,"I didn't care about any of the characters in this book. I know the author was trying to make rich characters that you'll remember longer than you'd remember the real topic of this book, but honestly I didn't care about even one of them. And I can't care about the characters, I can't care about the book, so this one gets two stars. It's not as completely awful as Palahniuk's ""Haunted,"" though, so I can't bring myself to give it just one star. Congratulations, Middlesex. You're not as bad as the book that made me puke."
4,Loved it,"Couldn't put it down. The author keeps drawing you in by switching from the distant past, the more recent past and the present and you can't wait to find out the ending for each of these periods. Fascinating."
4,couldn't put it down,"Just loved the unfolding of the main characters family, and thier thoughts about the choices/decisions they made in life. Yes this is a work a fiction but it shows how ones choices effect them and generations to come. This was a quick read for me , i happeded to be on vaction when i picked it up, was not disapointed really enjoyed it. This is not a redo of The Virgin Suicides , but it a very beautiful book. I wish that more of the story could have focused on Cal dealing with is gender but maybe the idea was that we need to move on and live with the cards we are dealt in life. I could not stop telling my friends about this book !!!"
2,Ruined my summer,"I guess a Pulitzer Prize and being on Oprah's Book List does not make for a good book. I spent my entire summer trying to get through this book. Fianlly on Saturday, September 15th at 10:38 am, I finished.I was not drawned into any of the characters, found that the narrative was all over the place, found that the descriptions were overwhelming and as far as being controversial, I don't even think that the author really touched on the subject but skirted the issue.I was very disappointed!!!"
3,A bit of Greek to me,"There were lots of interesting moments but nothing much deep nor writing style very clever to keep me involved. Plus I think the author took a couple of impossible short cuts. Perhaps my opinion is tainted by dissapointment with an event that we never get to see to its fruition--the hero's first full-blossomed romantic relationship. To me it was good, basic reading but nothing special."
1,Maybe I have to try it again,"I read the first 125 pages of this book and wonder what all the delirious reviews are about. To me, it's just dull and I can't seem to develop any interest in the story or the characters. I usually trust the reviews posted here. And Pulitzer winners always spark an interest in me. For now, I'm putting it away... maybe try to read it again some other time."
4,Beautiful and disturbing,"This book is beautifully written and truly unique. The style of prose, though sometimes drawn out, was creative and delicious. The taboo subjects of the book combined with the beautiful style made is a very pleasurable read."
5,You should read this!!!!,This novel is wonderful and original. I find it harder and harder to find a good book in a world of vampires and werewolves. However this book is interesting and entertaining.
4,Middlesex,"Our book club really liked this book. So well written, fascinating story, gave us a lot to discuss and our medical members were able to give us some insight on genetics and chromosomes as well."
4,Excellent,"This is one of the best books I have read in the past few years. Its interesting, engaging, well written, instructional and entertaining. Dont be put off by the subject matter. This is not a downer of a book. I wish I could find more books that I would enjoy as much as this on. Highly recommended!"
5,"I am loathe to agree with Oprah, however . . .","This is a must-read. Sparing the reader of this review a repeat of the summary of the story as provided by the other customer reviews, I wish to point out that what I loved about this book is that I felt it. Eugenides writes his story in such a way that provide the reader with a unique experience to understand, feel for, love or hate the characters contained within. I have never been quite so moved by a book like I was by this one. If you're looking for something to feel, this one is for you."
3,I didn't love it,"Having read the reviews and heard that this book was one of Oprah's picks for her book club, I couldn't wait to read it. I guess I'm in the minority when I say I didn't love the story or the characters very much. I read it entirely and then felt down. Guess it's not my kind of book."
5,When things start to click,"This is an amazing family pictorial. I still remember the day I was sitting in the bathroom of our old house on the campus of School of the Ozarks. It was the first time that I realized that I was alive and a person that was involved in the society that flowed around. It was the first time things just seemed to click and I was no longer a child. From that point on my thoughts changed and the World looked a little different. Somewhat like learning to ride a bike, the two wheels seem to make sense and balance becomes natural. This book is about Cal's same clicking point. It takes him quite a bit more time and pain to realize what he is all about, but that is understandable when you have to go against the grain of society. A coming of age book with a twist of sexualty."
3,Liked it but probably wouldnt read it again,"Middlesex was interesting, informative and historically balanced. The writing was stellar but it was simply TOO LONG."
3,nice book... well written,"I liked this book but didn't find it wonderful. At some point I found myself looking forward to getting to the end. Of course, books I truly enjoy I never want to end."
5,Brilliant,"Middlesex is an epic, engrossing novel of family, genetics, adolescence, geopolitics, love and the American way. It's hugely ambitious, spanning decades, continents, rare congenital disorders, race, suburbanisation, the works. Yet Eugenides is never less than in full control of his material.It's also roller-coaster of a read, a compelling narrative that is alternately hilarious and poignant with characters that seem initially a bit preposterous but who in the end you can't help but root for."
2,Disappointed,"I had to force myself to finish this book. It touched on many subjects that would have been interesting but always stopped short. The actual subject wasn't addressed until 3/4 of the way through and then it was only superficially. The writing was good but it was as if the author had A.D.D. and couldn't stay with one subject long enough to even bring it up in the first place. But then, that's just my opinion. Obviously many people enjoyed it as I hope you do."
3,Is it Me?,"Am I the only one who thought this was a big bore? This just went on and on. It was interesting, but it got so boged down in several places I found my self skimming and having a time to get through it. I read several books a week and this was NOT one I will recall in days to come."
2,Not a page turner,"I interrupted reading The Historian by Elizabeth Kotova, which I was barely into, to read this book because it was so highly recommended.I found it to be very plodding. I had to make a great effort to stay with it & found myself skipping over several paragraphs to get to the point, when often, there seemed to be no point.I found it hard to relate to Lefty & Desdemona's ""sin""....so what!The best parts of the book were about Cal's plight & the resolution of it near the book's end. That story was very interesting & could have fit into a much shorter book.I feel that society's pressure to perform sexually & to be well endowed give a false sense of empowermewnt to the male gender.What Julie & Cal decided what their relationship was going to be about, in the end, is what relationships that last are really about.Thank God I am finished with this book & blissfully back to my page turner...The Historian."
2,A little too epic and off subject?,"Nearly 300 pages into the book and hardly met the main character. I could easily stop now, but all the 5 star reviews have me curious. Not a stay-up-all-nighter by a long shot. This is a well written novel, but I am almost at the ""who cares"" point. It really needs the central figure to hold it together. I keep asking ""where is this going?"" and it just keeps going along in true epic fashion. If you picked this up for enlightenment on the life of a hermaphrodite, you have a long read before you get into his(her) story."
1,Misleading Reviews,"I don't get all the great reviews. I do read a lot of books, and a lot of long involved books with intricate plots and multiple story lines, but this book was so boring i had to stop 100 pages into it. I just need to know if the reviewers read beyond the first 15 pages, cause the first chapter or so is great, and then it falls off a cliff."
1,Very Disappointed,"I can see that alot of people read this book and loved it, but I am not one of them. I am only half way through it and am truly bored. I have absolutely no problem with the subject manner so I thought the book would be about factual events in the family history leading up to this persons challenges, growths, disappointments and frustrations. Being at the half way point and still not getting to Cal's personal story is a little unnerving. I'm moving on to something more ""meaty"" and mentally stinmulating, this just does nothing for me. It's sad because this is the 2nd book that Oprah suggested (the Road) that just did not thrill me. She should recommend ""Kite Runner"" or ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" Now there is some literary works that you can sink your teeth into!"
1,A Hellenistic Forrest Gump,"In case people think the comparison is meant as a compliment, it's not. This book had the same annoying way of coming up with coincidences that put people in the middle of ""supposedly"" historical occurrences. Just as I couldn't finish watching the movie, I couldn't finish reading this book. The characters and events were bland, and the magical realism didn't work.I couldn't understand why this book is so popular until I started reading the reviews and found out that it's an Oprah's Book Club selection. The copy I have doesn't have her logo. The logo is for me is an automatic indication that a book is going to be cheesy and poorly written.If you want to read excellent Greek tragedies about an incestuous relationship and its result, I suggest reading ""Oedipus"" and ""Antigone"" by Sophocles."
4,"I liked this book, except the ending","Great writing. Interesting characters. The ending was dissappointing though. San Francisco and sex clubs to find catharsis? So, so cliche."
5,TRULY AMAZING!!!!!,"There's already plenty of reviews that go into great detail describing this masterpiece novel so i'll just tell you how brilliant this writer is and how touching this book was for me. I couldn't put it down but forced mysaelf to because i didn't want it to end.The very first sentace grabbed me and i couldn't wait to read it. When i had only read 1/3 of the book i already knew i was reading a treasure, a story that would stay with me always, a book i would reccommend to everyone.This is TRULY my favorite book and i have read many great books but none has moved me like this one."
5,Could not put this book down,"Stop reading this review right now and put this book in your Amazon cart! This is quite simply my favorite book. I give it as a gift as often as I can and everyone who has received it from me has found it as engrossing as I did. Don't expect to read a few pages every night before bed--you will not want to put this one down. His other book, ""The Virgin Suicides,"" is also quite good, but did not capture me in its world like ""MIddlesex"" did."
5,unique and absorbing,"In the early 1920's, a Greek brother and sister from rural Turkey fall in love. They move to Detroit, have children and one of their children marries a cousin. The result of their marriage is Calliope Stephanides, the narrator of Middlesex and a hermaphrodite.Eugenides takes readers through an epic history of three generations of a Greek family and the 50-year transition of Detroit life. The characters are unique, vivid and evoke sympathy and understanding. The writing is evocative and the story epic, taking readers from a remote Turkish village to the growth of the American automobile industry, the Detroit racial riots, and the San Francisco sex scene.The last quarter of the book, after Calliope (Cal) finds out that she's a hermaphrodite, the action is rapid and sometimes seems over-the-top. Despite this, the book successfully comes full circle and is a very enjoyable read."
4,Excellent,"This isn't really a book as much as it's an experience. You get to experience, through the ages, the most intimate moments of Cal's strange lineage, before being completely immersed in the fascinating adventure of Cal's life. Don't be put off by the size of the book, as soon as you finish you'll get a feeling of deep satisfaction, like you've just finished a particularly delicious and filling cup of creamy ice cream. The book describes the events that lead to the formation of Cal and the actual life of Cal until he/she is an adult. Fascinating. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it does drag along sometimes."
5,A wild ride,"Weird, witty, and wonderful. This is the most original book I've ever read. A thoroughly enjoyable read and highly recommended."
5,Amazing - one of the best books I've read in a long time,This book is incredibly well written - it really draws you in. Fascinating how it draws you into the lives of the characters and makes you feel their pain and joy. Very highly recommended.
1,"Horrible, boring, stupid misleading book","(1) Sexual ambiguity is not caused by genetics, especially incest. It is insulting to ""inter-sexed"" people everywhere.(2) This book is horribly boring(3) The book got interesting just as it ended, when the teenager ran away rather than become something he wasn't. The book should have started here, not ended.I was really disappointed. The Virgin Suicides was a small gem of a book. This book not only has a faulty premise, it's at least one third too long.What was the point of this book? I'm still wondering... Blech! What a poor choice for a Pulitzer. Considering the current publishing climate, though, I'm not surprised."
2,Disappointing,After reading all these reviews I thought I wouldn't be a ble to put the book down. Instead I was skimming pages to see what would happen and when the book finally starts getting interesting it ends
2,"Technically Good Writing - Nevertheless, Awful","The only reason I could justify 2 stars is because Eugenides is, technically anyway, a very good writer. He writes fluidly and expertly. So, it's not the way he says it - it's what he says that's awful. I chose to put the book down just over quarter of the way in, rather than continue participating in the assault on my sensibilities.Eugenides has the emotional and intellectual cowards' talent for relying on cliched irony in place of thoughtful and original observation of the human condition. He's managed to jam into this large book every piece of sexually, emotionally and politically corrected tripe offered up by the most vulgar members of our society and the overall effect is of well composed regurgitation. The writer seems not to have been able to resist even one cliche. As a result, the book is relentlessly predictable and boring. Save your money."
1,Definitely Not Pulitzer Worthy,"It must have been a weak year for literature if this kind of boring tripe was winning awards. Eugenides is awful. It's a sorry state of affairs when smart people can't spot mediocrity right in front of their faces. I'd give him five stars for spelling all his words correctly, but no stars for everything else."
3,"Good, interesting, but with some big flaws","This is an interesting story and an easy read (very easy, the 500 pages fly.) BUT, given that the there is so much research which has shed light on the intersexed, it is impossible to see as anything but a fatal flaw the decision to make the chromsonely male narrator totally at ease with being raised a female until the onset of adolescence.Also, incomprehensible is Eugendies decision to make this 1960 born girl, who is portrayed as a voracious reader, unaware, until quite late, of what ""happens to woman every month"". Come on, girls of that generation who read, read ""Are you there God, its me Margaret"" Menstruation was no mystery, even to those raised in homes where it was not talked about!"
4,interesting book,"I thought this was an interesting book. I was never quite sure what a ""trans gender"" was, at least not a correct medical definition. This offered a pretty good look into how one might come to have such a condition, also how things were probably handled then, and some medical information. I thought it started a little slow, but it was interesting and informative."
3,Okay,"The writing was great. The beginning is a great story about the main character's grandparents, but then somewhere in the middle it starts to slip because the main character's story is just sort of boring and all over the place. Two-thirds through the book I had to force myself to finish it."
1,shockingly bad,"this is the most shallow, insipid book i've read in years. if you buy this book based on the false information that it's about the interesting life of a hermaphrodite as i did, you will be very sorry. Well, there is a small section toward the end that is about such a person, but it's very short in relation to the size of the entire book, and it only covers a small part of the character's life. The remaining 90 percent or so of the book is an expansive history of the hermaphrodite's witless, boring, incestuous relatives and eugenides is careful not to leave out any of the details about their bungling, banal adventures. [...]another reason I purchased this dog of a book is that it won the pulitzer, being under the false impression that this indicated above-average writing. won't be making that mistake again."
1,Tedious At Best,I chose to read this book because of someone else's recommendation. I was sorry I did. This book just dragged on from page one. I was really looking forward to reading Callie/Cal's story but for a good part of the novel all you get is a detailed family history filled with incest. That idea wasn't too bad but it was just too drawn out. I wanted to read more about Callie and I just didn't get it. Save your money and time.
5,"An excellent, wonderfully written book!","I saw Middlesex on a shelf in Target and picked it up. Quickly, I put it back down because I was embarrassed that someone may see me looking at a book about a hemaphrodite. But I thought about the book for days until finally ordering it. It was truly amazing. The storyline was awesome and the language of the book was fantastic. Eugenides makes you part of the family. You can honestly feel yourself at the dinner table on Sunday afternoon. Towards the end of the book I began feeling a little burnt-out on the whole concept, but it could not ruin what I had already read. Don't be ashamed that you actually want to read a book about a hemaphrodite, because this is one you can't live without reading! Pick it up and don't put it down."
5,My Big Fat Greek Page-Turner,"The panorama of history covered by Eugenides is truly amazing. I was charmed by the details, amused by the references to history (Forrest Gump style, but with more bite), and thoroughly taken in by the plot. I loved the lack of resolution at the end; Cal/Callie's story is real rather than fairy tale, and problems don't always come together neatly. Most importantly, however, I really enjoyed the depth and roundness of the characters -- I felt I was spending time with people in my own neighborhood (which is remarkable when one looks at the basic premise of the novel.) If you like books that manage to be bizarre and familiar at the same time, this is the book for you!"
5,A delicate topic--terrific story,"A good story is always the basis for an award of 5 stars from me. This story swept me from the quiet Greek town, through the tumult of war, into the immigrant experience in Detroit. The family secret never revealed results in the narrator's unusual life journey from girlhood to manhood."
4,You Are Such a Flirt,"What a tease. Have you ever felt like you were teased for so long that the payoff just wasn't as good as the windup? Middlesex teased me for so long, flirted with me, that when the big bang came, I sat there wishing we were still flirting.That being said, Jeffrey Eugenides is a beautiful writer. I could taste the Greek air and smell the sour streets of Detroit.The issues in this book were handled with respect, and Eugenides allowed the world's true perceptions to seep in through the character's description of himself."
3,Had a hard time with it,"I liked the book but didn't love it. The last 1/4 or so of the book was great, but I was bored to death when reading about the grandparents and their plight. I would have been more into the book had I been able to skip that part entirely."
4,Excellent,Loved this book! I enjoyed this much more than the Virgin Suicides. Great back story and structure to the main story makes this one of the better multi-generational family novels that I have ever read.Excellent.
3,Middlesex,"This is the story of a young man, born as a hermaphrodite (as the result of his ancestors inbreeding), and raised as a girl. A really interesting premise, but kind of a slow story. I enjoyed the idea being the book more than the book itself."
2,Not my favorite...,"This was our book club selection. If I did not enjoy our book club discussions so much, I might not have finished this one. So many good books, so little time. The writing seems a little cumbersome, and the story is just OK. I do think that the 2nd half was easier to read -- maybe it moved a little quicker, or I just got used to the author's writing style. Some Greek and Detroit history woven nicely into the story. Would've really appreciated the Detroit info more had I been familiar with the area. Not one I would pass along to friends and family, but one of the girls in my club is a third of the way through and enjoying, so, who knows?"
5,Awesome book,I read this book a couple years ago and was completely entrhalled with it. I am an avid reader that is always looking for books that enlighten me and keep me turning pages into the night. A great book!
5,What Normal Is,"Probably like lots of other people, I always heard of this novel as being ""that book about a hermaphrodite,"" and to my surprise found out that it is so much more, and that the sexuality of the character of Cal is not even the point of the story. Although some of the sections of this novel seem contrived (i.e., the ""coincindental"" reappearance of some of the characters, Middlesex is delightful, touching, wise and truthful. Like Cal, it is much more than the sum of its parts, and the reader will come away with mixed emotions, but all of them will be from having experienced literature that strives to do what all good literature does: hold a mirror up to the way we live and love."
3,"Not Much to Laugh About in this Big, Fat Greek Tragedy","Middlesex is built on the recurring theme of familial relationships informed by war and mayhem. It's flush with history that's relevant to the characters' experiences and that brings a little reality to some unbelievable plot moments. The story idea is new - Calliope is the most entertaining gender-defiant person since Myra Breckinridge. Yes, there's a lot to like about this book. But, the lengthy, albeit well-researched medical science, makes for laborious reading. And, except for Calliope, the center of the story, the characters are pretty flat. Although the adult Cal tells much of the story from her (now his) childhood perspective, I never heard the child's voice. As in most real-life family situations, there is dark humor here; yet, there is too little laughter to take Middlesex beyond an awareness that it's fiction."
5,Awesome,"I can't recommend this book highly enough.Yes, it deals with incest and hermaphrodites. But it is so sensitive and the characters so fully developed it is completely irresistible. Don't go looking for shock value. Instead expect a wonderful novel about a person in search of identity.This isn't just a book you should read, it's one you should keep to read again."
5,My favourite Bildungsroman,"I'm not often a fan of books that record people's coming of age so I tried to steer clear of Middlesex for a while. When I was finally convinced to read it, I was in for a pleasant surprise. Afterall, when was the last time you read a novel where the protagonist was a hermaphrodite? I liked how it mixed history into the narrative as it allowed the reader to think of how an immigrant family may interpret American race relations. I also appreciated the ending which saw Cal performing a traditional Greek custom that affirmed her coming to grips with her second life - and tied in nicely with the periodic episodes of Cal's contemporary world in Berlin."
2,What's all the hype about?,"I expected so much from this book! People at my book club RAVED about it. I trudged through it, expecting it to get better, and it finally did--in the last quarter of the book. Why did I have to trudge through 350 pages of Greek history to get to the meat of the book? I don't get it, and I certainly don't get what makes this book Pulitzer-worthy."
3,"Not man, not woman, not great.","As a fan of ""Virgin Suicides"" and a resident of a remote outpost of the ""hair belt"" -- a Greek-American neighborhood -- I was particularly interested in checking out ""Middlesex."" However, the originality and admirable concision of ""Suicides"" deserts Eugenides in his latest novel. Not that there aren't great things about ""Middlesex"": It is another intimate and loving look at Detroit, a city, like Pittsburgh, that hardly gets its due in U.S. literature. But Eugenides tends to noodle when he could sketch something in a few strokes, and he has absolutely no sense of humor. And for a book about hermaphrodites and illicit love, there is little in the way of believable passion or lust. Sadly, writers like Eugenides, Franzen and Chabon seem to think that writing long, painterly, rather pedestrian stories will place them in the pantheon. I hope they're wrong."
1,Couldn't Finish It!,"This book was just terrible!! I loved his book ""The Marriage Plot"", so I was looking forward to reading this one, which was so acclaimed, but I absolutely hated it. I hated the point of view, but mostly the incredibly ridiculous amount of extraneous detail that he put in, which only took away from the story itself, which was interesting. I stuck it out for half the book, hoping it would get better, but it didn't, and so I moved on to another book."
2,needs a buzz cut and a point,"I avoided reading this book, not because of the hermaphrodite subject matter, but because I have never read a multigenerational family saga that I liked. Many books let me down in the middle, and this was no exception. The beginning of the book was incredible and harrowing, with momentum and characterization. The post-America nextgens part of the saga was so boring I found myself flipping and flipping - always a bad sign. If there was some kind of larger point to all of that, then I must have missed it. Yes there's the identity duality and trinity themes playing out here: man/woman, greek/turkish/american modern/old world sick/healthy innocent/guilty original/reinvented. But it was almost as if the author was saying - here it is again - get it? I like my fiction much more subtle than this."
2,So wordy,"My book club read this and I was so bored with it, so darn wordy! And the story I was interested it was how does a person react and live with the discovery she made, not her Grandparents' sex life!If you see the movie Guilt Trip and have read this book, the book on tape scenes with the Mother and son will be pretty funny for you!"
3,Not Pulitzer-worthy,"For those who claimed it started out slow. I actually thought it started out with a bang. I loved the historical background of the family, the move to Detroit, the journey through Ford, the silkworms, etc...but somehow the novel lacked the totality of drive and spirit that makes other recent Pulitzer winners (Kavalier & Clay, Empire Falls) instant classics."
4,Large Book,"This is a large book so be prepared for some extra time in reading it. There are some good subplots to go along with the main theme in this book. Well written, the author does a good job of keeping your attention, at least as best as possible considering the size of the book. I would recommend."
3,"A very long, long read","I bought this book because of all the wonderful reviews it had received. I do think that Jeffrey Eugenides is a very good writer, but I also think that this book was way too slow in the reading. It didn't hold my interest as I couldn't help skipping pages in the last third of the book. Perhaps it was just too long and that's the reason I kept losing interest. However, I do have to say that you care about the characters, who they are and what they want. The story is very much worth telling but I wish the editor had worked a little more magic in the second half of the book."
2,Couldn't Get Into This One,"I wanted to like this book. I tried to like this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't get very far. It just didn't interest me. I had a hard time getting through the old family stories and had to put it down."
2,"Not complete rubbish, but nearly","I don't get it. Pulitzer Prize? It's written in an erudite highschooler's Vonnegutese. We have to wade through chapter upon chapter of unlikely incest and marriages in order to arrive at the narrator's rare genetic mutation...A great contemporary novel, in my view, is something like A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry. I state this so other readers will see where I am coming from. I got a huge kick out of The Quincunx by Charles Palliser.I suspect that a younger audience that hasn't read much would be impressed by Middlesex, or by themselves for finishing it. I nearly recycled it but decided to give it away instead."
2,It's alright.,"I don't know what to say, really. Jeffrey Eugenides either hits a mark, or doesn't. I know it's easy to compare this to his other book The Virgin Suicides, seeing as he got success from that. However, while I find he may have some good plot ideas, he is not the kind of writer I enjoy. Eugenides writing doesn't strike chords with me, and I lost interest fast. Sadly, all I can say is it's a love or hate book and feel free to try it yourself. You may like it. I didn't."
3,Strange,"I received this book for Christmas and finally got around to reading it. I found myself putting it down quite often until I got to the last two sections. The plot was interesting and weird at the same time. After reading a few chick-lit books and romance novels, this sure made me think and cringe at the same time. No doubt Eugenides has a knack for un-ordinary plots. If you've read ""The Virgin Suicides,"" you will most likely enjoy this novel."
1,200 pages in...I still don't get it,"I read the first 200 pages of this book and wonder what all the delirious reviews are about. The plot is going nowhere, and I just don't see where this book is going. To me, it's just dull and I can't seem to develop any interest in the story or the characters. I'm going to skip the remaining 325 pages of this bool."
2,Was not as interesting you would think,"I am open to many kinds of subjects and novels and have a wide range of tastes,that is why ""Middlesex"" appealed to me. While I was reading it, i kept thinking how depressing this book was and the story line was OK, but not dynamic. It seemed to me the Cal/Callie character could have been more interseting in tone and thoughts. The author can write well and the books flows well, however the subject, being dark anyway, didn't meet my expectations. I will certainly try another time to read this author's work."
3,Okay Story,"I purchased this book after reading all of the rave reviews on Amazon.com. I am halfway through now, and I don't know that I'll finish. As I'm reading this story, I keep waiting for the it to grab me, but it doesn't. I feel like I'm missing something after reading all the reviews. It just isn't that exciting. Possibly I just need to finish it."
2,Disappointing,"After a great beginning where the storytelling starts off like a novel by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, this novel disintegrates into a cheap sex tale. Skip the ending and read the beginning. Much more interesting."
1,Porn??,"Surely this is just soft porn? The reader is titlated, if that is your thing, for page after page. It has no literary quality."
4,"enormous, historical, personal, complicated and complex","this book is long long long... but worth reading. i bet it makes something as literature. however, i found the strong emotions come in when Callie starts feeling different (or maybe my emotion started there:). i was a little tired of the dully drama the grandparents create. and parents' memories of young times are distant to me too. i like the retrieving but solid way the author makes Callie, also her narrative. a weird thing is every time there is death, humor is brought to be with bitterness. i guess it is a good way to catch reader's compassion, at least for me ^^"
3,Good Novel- Very Unique,"When I started reading this book, I thought I would be innundated with medical terms, but that is not really what the essence of this book is about. You really feel like you know the characters at the end. I ennjoyed reading about the life of three generations of Greek Americans- very informative also of the some US history. I recommend it."
5,What A Fantastic Book!,"Having just finshed the last line of this exceptional, moving and compelling book I can truly say it will be placed on my list of all time favorites. When I bought this,I only knew that it was about a hermaphrodite. I had no idea this journey of a girl that discovers she's actually a boy would be so utterly fantastic. Moving between the present Cal and back nearly eighty years to his Greek immigrant grandparents who started the mutation that manifests itself in the body of the narrator, Jeffrey Eugenides writes with a creative narrative flair that unfolds in a near cinematic way.The winning voice of Calliope/Cal brought to mind John Irving's ""Owen Meany"", and the book left me with the same feeling of awe when I finished."
1,boring,"couldn't finish...no 'there, there.' just couldn't care less about brother/sister marriage, any of the characters. seemed pointless. don't understand what all the hoopla is about. i ususally dislike award winning books....i think i'll stop buying them (three junes, yuck, etc.). best book i have read lately is 'emperor of ocean park.' that was interesting and different."
1,Evelyn Woods would not be happy with me.....,"My sister told me to get this book - she raved about it, couldn't say enough wonderful things about it. Well, I bought it, paid too much to have it shipped to Europe from the US and it has taken me 5 days to read maybe 20 pages. I HATE this book and do not understand the fuss. Lost interest within the first sentence or two when the author had the narrator calling his/her brother ""Chaper Eleven."" Yuck is all I have to say."
2,Not for Me,"I read almost all the Oprah picks and this book did not appeal to me at all. I am truly mystified as to why so many people thought this book was so great. I don't have a clue as to why Oprah picked this one. I couldn't really get into the main character, a hermaphrodite. I did not find the story compelling either."
1,Did not like this book,"I found this book to be boring and disjointed and almost ""fake"" literature - whatever I mean by that. Did not like this at all."
3,not so much,"I made myself read 100 pages and then I was interested enough to finish the book...but I wouldn't do it again. I love stories about ""different"" people, but this book was tedious and ultimately disappointing. Too bad."
2,Middlesex,I found the box to be somewhat interesting in terms of culture and customs with the beginning starting off well enough but it became somewhat tiresome as it progressed. Would have been better if it was written with a lot less words.
3,The Audiobook,"I am actually not finished with the audiobook version of Middlesex but I wanted to comment on the narrator. He's actually pretty painful to listen to. His voice is so low and husky, it's hard to hear in the car. Also, when he does a woman's voice you can't help but picture a man in drag. When he does the voices of the Greek-Americans in Detroit he makes them sound ...(imagine Mel Brooks reading this part). And the Greek pronunciation isn't terrible but he's still anglicizing the Greek (a greek delta is pronounced like ""th"" in ""them""). I pay so much attention to the voice that its hard to listen to the words!"
3,Middle SEX!,"Very different book that catches you right from the beginning. Had I not been stuck on a plane with a 5 hour delay, I probably wouldn't have continued but I became intrigued. The middle part was tedious and didn't capture my attention quite the same as the beginning and the end. The characters were well developed but towards the end, I felt almost as if it were two completely different books (one with the historical perspective and one in the more modern world). It didn't mesh too well for me and I wouldn't recommend it as highly as others."
3,"Entertaining, but not a classic","I enjoyed this as a book on tape, but I've enjoyed Eugenides' other work much more. I highly recommending finding his short story ""Baster."""
4,Great book,"I really enjoyed this book and the perspective it gave to growing up as a hermaphrodite and not knowing anything was different about you. Cal is a character that you sympathize for, yet he doesn't want or need that. The beginning of the book was difficult to get the flow of, and therefore it took me a while to get into it. Once I did, thought, I couldn't put it down."
3,Ran out of steam,"It's not you, it's me. That's what I felt like saying to this book. It's brilliant, it's dazzling, it's all of those things; but for whatever reason it simply didn't grip me enough. Perhaps Mr Eugenides is more interested in the act of writing than in the effect his writing will have on his readers. And I mean no offense by that: it's a noble stance and he is very, very talented. The book just lost me after about 450 pages."
3,Disappointed in story flow,"I looked forward to this one as it kept showing up in my recommendations and finally read it for my book club, however, I found a long and difficult book to read and don't really recommend it. From the beginning the reader knows the story is about a hermaphrodite raised as a girl but eventually chosing to be a man. The 500+ pages of family history was slow and not particularly engaging. The story of the main character and his sexuality was only a bit more interesting. I had just read East of Eden, and for a multi-generational, family saga, I much preferred it to this more modern story. And, the Salina Valley much more enticing than Detroit, even in its hey-day!"
4,I actually wish it was longer,I read several complaints about the length however I wanted more. I wanted to know what happened between the family reunion and the current narration. But reviewing what was there it was a satisfying book full of historical information and clarity about a very complex story.
4,"intelligent written, attention grabber","To start with, this book is quite longer than it should be but then again one can't explain on this when one find him/herself going through this book non-stop. It's so hard to put it down. If I don't have class or homeworks to do, I would just sit there and read it through.I've never read books by this author before but his writing style really grabs me. The book is cleverly written with good selection of vocabularies. For someone from other country like me, I find it very difficult to deal with those vocabularies but they help me learn big words.I would recommend this book to everyone. Don't miss it."
5,Middlesex,Fabulous. The writing detailinf life in Detroit during the riots was fascinating. What a tale he weaves.
1,No need to finish.,I read this book for my book club and was one of two who actually finished the novel. Not a single member of the club enjoyed it and reviews all around were terrible.
1,Another disappointment,"This book has all the commonplace sensational ingredients of aJerry Springer show -- incest, the dysfunctional family, genderconfusion. Etc. My advice is to go watch a kids sports event.You will learn more about human nature, and have more fun, thanreading another derivative work (amazing that anyone would thinkthis book is ""original"")."
3,Dissapointing,"After reading all of the reviews, I was excited to read this book. However, I found it dissapointing. The book, which begins with an epic tale of Desdamona and Lefty, began slow but kept my interest. I identified with the characters and, though slow at times, was excited to continue reading.As the book progressed, I found myself becoming more and more disinterested. I found myself skimming certain pages waiting for the few and far between exciting passages. Callie was difficult to identify with and I was left wondering what the point was.The book, which began so full of promise, quickly became a different story altogether, a story with characters which were difficult to idenfity with. I did not care what happened to them. The second half of the book tainted the beginning which was so lovely. Perhaps I am missing something though, as the majority of readers appear to have enjoyed the book."
1,Too flowery,"I wanted to enjoy this book, but as the author discloses at the beginning, his work is very poetic and sappy, and he goes off on so many tangents, it is hard to follow the story."
2,Almost didn't finish,"Very disappointed in this book. I just can't understand how this book won a Pulitzer Prize. This is not so much the story of Cal and his gender identity but more of his family which just didn't need to be explained in such detail. The family background was important, but it took up too much of the book. Just too much in this book that didn't need to be there. And seriously, the sex scenes with the grandparents - what value did this add? I wanted to hear more about Cal and was left feeling empty. This could have been a good story."
4,Fascinating Narrative,"Although I think many people may be dismayed at the idea of a teenage hermaphrodite growing up in a Detroit Greek immigrant household in the 70's, this is a novel with mass appeal. Whether or not you have a single thing in common with the story, you'll find it a fascinating read. Isn't the point of reading to take us into other people's lives and cultures? Eugenides manages to draw his readers into this world with amazing clarity, and leaves you better off and more knowledgeable than you were before. I recommend this book to anyone seeking entertainment and a heightened sense of the world."
4,"Thought provoking, well-written, a little long.","A thoroughly enjoyable read, unusual characters, all well-developed. The plot moves you along and the dialogue is fresh. It drags a little at times, but this is more than made up for by its other appealing elements."
5,Amazing.,"I'm not sure what I could write about this book that hasn't already been said in a prior review, so I'll keep this simple - READ THIS BOOK. Very unique story line and amazing character development. Very well written."
5,there is a reason it won the Pulitzer prize,"This is a fastinating and well crafted story. You feel you are reading the work of a very talented author as you move through the pages. For someone who is looking to get the satisfaction of reading a book about ten levels above the typical beach book, I recommend you read Middlesex. You won't be disappointed."
2,Uninspiring long story,"To me there was nothing exceptional about this book. It was a long, unemotional story that lacked characters with any real depth. The narrative was boring from start to finish but I forced myself to finish this book. I would not recommend this book for a any reason to anyone."
3,Just OK,"This book was just OK, felt sort of ""put on"" at times, but it was a nice quick read. Recommended for light reading material in between denser books."
1,Disappointing,"This book by Jeffrey Eugenides was an unexpected disappointment, when I read it after many friends suggested it. The setting was familiar to me, especially Petoskey and Bay View. My reading of it was depressing and sad. Even though I finished the book, I was left feeling down and that I was cheated. I still cannot figure what many others have found to be so interesting about Middlesex."
1,"Hey, EuGENITALS, write something honest.","How in the H-E Double Hockey Sticks did this book win the Pulizer Prize? I thought it was really bad--pretentious; full of flat characters (when a main character kicks it, I felt absolutely nothing); the main thrust of the novel, no pun intented, is a cheap trick (I only kept reading to see what the protagonist's genitals look like--hey, Bookie's human); FULL of $5 words and completely irrelevant details. The writing style is average, nothing special, and certainly nothing literary. And for all the research Eugenides did (and why did he have to include EVERYTHING he discovered in that research?), the early '70s portion of the novel is full of anachronisms. Nobody had feathered hair in 1974, and at that time, Meryl Streep was a movie star of the future. Bottom line: annoying, too long, too fakey-fake and TOO flat. All that said, there were two or three truly beautiful sentences in this cluttered-up book. Hey, EuGENITALS, write something honest."
2,hype,"yes, there is genius in lines, a tour-de-force in providing us with greek tragedy, but all in the service, not really of the book, but in the service of the author. We are looking at a writer, saying ""Look how smart I am."" This book is patched together. Like another reader said, read the New Yorker extract."
3,Skip this and just read the exerpted story in the New Yorker,"I had liked the first novel, VIRGIN SUICIDES, and was more than usually entertained by the story in the New Yorker last month (exerpted from this novel of over 500 pages). I was dissappointed by 80% of the book. Not the writing which was all fine, but the subject matter which was several notches less interesting than the teenage hermaphroditic sexual awakening story that had been featured in the New Yorker story. There was a little more in the novel about the hermaphoditic life of the narrator but not enough to justify the price of a new hardback."
5,Make coffee...,"Middlesex is the best book I've read this year. My all-time ""top 10"" list probably has 20 books on it and ""Middlesex"" is one. Very well written and a very enjoyable and compelling read. It's the kind of book you find yourself still reading at 2:30 AM, finishing a chapter and saying to yourself, OK...just one more chapter..."
5,Too Many Great Things about this Book,"This book is pretty near perfect. It works as an engaging story of a girl discovering that she is a hermaphrodite. It works as a metaphor for European immigration and assimilation into the United States. It works as a story of a child entering adolescence and adulthood. And it is a fantastic treatment of the great city of Detroit, highlighting all of its majesty and all of its shame."
3,Steady decline but still a good read,"I kept expecting this book to get better, but the best parts were in the beginning. The grandparents' exit to the US and their start in Detroit was fascinating. Cal's parents were interesting but less so, and Cal, who in theory should have been the most interesting, was the least interesting character of all."
3,A Great Story but No Bang,"Well written, interesting, and easy to read. The story is even good, its just that it never had any real climax to it. Sort of like an old western that kept promising something exciting but it never panned out."
4,Middlesex,"Very well written and interesting. A story that educates the readers about history, different cultures and times. I really enjoyed it. My partner enjoyed it too, although she complained that it seemed to have little plot. I just loved the story."
2,A major disappointment,"This novel has a wonderful narrative voice, fluent and engaging and capacious, able to swing from family to history to science, coining some excellent metaphors along the way. But nothing happens. Or more acccurately, none of the things that happen matter. A city is destroyed, an incestuous couple fall out of love, a father dies in a slapstick car chase, and none of it sticks, none of it hurts. This is a smooth, easy, painless epic. A novel over five hundred pages long needs to break your heart a couple of times. The one complaint I'd heard was that the Greek family sections were great but the Cal/Calpurnia stuff never took off. For me, however, the Greek family didn't take off either. Eugenides writes very well and he had a great idea for a novel here but some kind of emotional/dramatic disconnect in his art has resulted in a weightless cartoon."
5,Absorbing and Intriguing,"""I was born twice..."" this book begins. What an intriguing start. And the story lives up to the promise of those words. The past of a young man's grandparents makes a curious historical love story, taking the reader from the burning of Smyrna to the burning of a Detroit suburb, with odd detours through the beginnings of radical Islam and the American dream. I loved the quiet mystery of the main character, the challenge of unknown identity that slowly changes to known but strange. And I loved the challenge to the reader's preconceptions in the writing. How would we react? And what right would we have to complain? Cal, or Calliope, is Greek and American, man and woman, but above all human, and this delightfully human tale paints a picture of him that sings."
4,Well Done,"Middlesex has all these ingredients for a great novel: a multi-generational family history, cultural mixing, war, the coming of age of a teenager and sex! I could throw in other little spices too: race relations, growing old, dating, 20th century American history. And the book has the feel of a college-literature-class-assigned reading. But thankfully I read it on my own, so I'm not being smacked down by a professor's analysis and classmates' sophistry. The book is not as good as The Corrections and not as engaging as The Secret History. But it isn't too far behind either."
3,"OK, not great","I anticipated a much more engaging read, based on the number of glowing reviews. However, it was disappointing for me and I would call it just ok. In many ways it is a superficial story of a hermaphrodite and I didn't find the ""historical,Sci.,psychological, political,or geographical context"" compelling at all. They too seemed superficial. I felt obligated to finish it, always hoping it would pick up, but unfortunately it didn't. I would not recommend it."
2,Was disappointed,Since this book got such high reviews I purchased it but was very disappointed. I actually never finished the book. I lost interest midway through it. It was too confusing and required way too much concentration for a good read.
3,instructions video- thumbs down!,the kit is great but the video it comes with is kinda annoying. . . the instructor had a very distracting lisp. . . but the kit it good. the bands are great and the balls are a little heavy at first.
2,"Good intention, cheaply made",I've bought this mount about a year ago from another site. I use it with my AXIM as GPS navigation system. It was pretty easy to install and use. Sound quality and level is good. I am totally agree with the previous review about all the details. The only thing I'd like to suggest people who have it: never leave it in the car during the summer heat. The PDA holder (racheting mechanism) made from very cheap plastic. When it stopped holding my PDA I took it a parts and found that gear shaft is bended because it was subjected to the high temperature inside the car meanwhile it is side-loaded by the racheting mechanism's spring. In my understanding designer must take in consideration ambient temperature and select an appropriate material for implementation.
4,Works as advertised,"I have had the Arkon Mount for about 6 weeks - and it functions as promised - so far! I purchased it for the speaker to go with my GPS software on my Dell Axim x51v - and it is worth it just for that feature. I really can't use the PDA version of the software without it.It is also great that it has the option to charge both my PDA and at least one other accessory.The only shortcoming of the product is the side grips aren't that reliable when the unit is securing my Axim with the extended battery installed. It DOES work, though. When I switch out to the regular battery, it is particularly secure -- and the standard battery really is all you need since the unit is charging all the time."
1,western,"A bit disappointing as the outside cover does not read ""The Best of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp like the inside discs do. I was hoping to get the entire series as I would like to see the episode of where he gets the Buntline special. Otherwise it is OK."
4,"Flawed, but great","This was the first adult TV western series, aired before Gunsmoke. The episodes are very good. The problem is the DVD production. Many episodes are out of order, so to watch the seies in the order it was originally aired, you must jump from one disc to another and back. Yes, there are two episodes from season two on the last disc, but they are before the final couple of season one episodes. Finally, the show opening credits are from a much later season, after Earp moved to Tombstone (which would make the credits shown from season five or six), not the Ellsworth and Witchita episodes. Seasons two, three and four are set in Dodge City... will the opening still be from Tombstone? These minor details makes this a flawed DVD set. I hope the future seasons have the correct show opening credits and the episodes are in the order they originally aired."
5,THE LIFE & TIMES OF WYATT EARP SEASON 1,"This has to be the Best Western on TV back in the 1950's & 60's. It is even better than I remember it. And it is based on a Real Person, not a character made up by writers. Anyone who appreciates well thought out stories and characters will enjoy this series. It is a video that the Whole Family can watch and enjoy. You will Love It Too... Don Maris"
5,Finally they put this out.,"What fond memories of this TV series. I've pre-ordered Season Two and cant wait to get it. This was put out in the early 1950's, not even 25 years after Wyatt Earp died so you have to think that there is some truth to the stories as to how things were back in the 1870's."
4,A Great Mix Of Urban Grooves,"This CD was given to me by a person who read some of my CD reviews. I heard the track ""When The Funk Hits The Fan"" a couple of years ago but never knew who made it. This was a great trade because I'm always in to new underground music and this one is excellent. A touch of acid, funk, and soul cover CD and I'm my ears were blessed by it's sounds. A great CD for collection of good music.oNe"
2,Good Overview hard to read,"I have read the half of this book and I do believe that there are better books than this one. I got this one in my J++ package for free, but I rather to expend a bit more and get a better book where to learn easier."
1,"Experienced programmers, don't bother",Not a very useful book for the experienced programmer. Java language features are not covered in detail. Absolutely no reference to database connectivity.
2,Not for Application Developers,"This is kind of an odd book, because it's a MS Press book and it has very little information on MS Java specifics like WFC. This is a ""rank-beginner"" book. It also has quite a bit on applets, and console apps which in not why I bought and use VJ6. If you want to create WFC applications for Windows with J++6, get the Developer's Workshop instead. If you know nothing about Java, you may want to start here."
3,This book does not explain major points well.,"This is not a book for beginners. I am just learning how to program and I find this book very confusing. The book does not explain some of the major concepts thouroghly and some of the labs don't work, although some of the labs are very fun and interesting.This would probably be a very good book if you already have experience in programming, infact I would highly recomend this book to experienced programmers. Overall the book is O.K. All the explanations are dull and hard to comprehend, but you can learn a lot from the labs."
4,Hit the ground running.,"Ideal book for those whose eyes glaze over after the first 500 pages of the metaphysics of OOP found in most Java books. The authors walk you through paced examples and exercises that skip over a lot of the details that are peripheral to the current topic under consideration. The only reservation is that J++, Microsoft's dialect of Java, is probably going to be phased out in favor of C#. CD-ROM includes examples and exercises plus a trial edition of J++."
3,"Good, Bad, & Ugly","Good:Dives right in, plenty of resources. Fast track to learning.Bad:Begins moving rather rapidly in third chapter, a basic knowlege of java would helps significantly about here.Ugly:There are a few misprints in the book. Be on your toes and follow the instructions to the letter. If something does not appear in the book as it apppears on your screen, back up, look around and make it right."
2,Not as easy to follow as I had hoped.,The book was hard to follow and it didn't really help you understand how or why the code was incorrect.
1,Dont waste your time,"This book looks great for beginners , I started the first chapter : GREAT !, The second one : WOW ! but at the third, the examples didn't work, so did the fourth and fifth chapter, also the solutions in the CD are wrong, so I cant go further !, don't waste your money on this book. By The way, I'm talking about the spanish version of this book, it's the worst I've seen."
2,Pelagian Pap,"I am really surprised this book ever made it to print. Guardini's Roman Catholic's worldview is an unfortunate confirmation of many Protestant caricatures. Guardini wrongly sees the heart of this prayer as praying for God's will to be accomplished (Thy will be done) and that God's will is ""endangered"" and ""frail."" He fails to see that this prayer is addressed to a sovereign God. What is worse about this book is the fact that he uses pious, flowery language without an ounce of content. A good and insightful Roman Catholic perspective on the Lord's Prayer is A. J. Cardinal Simonis' book _Our Father_. An even better and Protestant commentary is Thomas Watson's _The Lord's Prayer_. A lot is at stake: may your prayers prosper in the Gospel."
5,Sister's Story,"I bought this book for our two sets of grandaughter sisters...five in all. They loved it and read many of the stories several times. To me, it reinforces the importance of staying close to your sister and regarding her as a most special friend. Mary Engelbreit brings traditional values to the younger generation in a way that they enjoy and retain!"
2,It is not a real print server,I tried to use this unit also as a print server but it only support a few printers so now I need to buy an additional stuff to share the printer in my home. It was a surprise for me because they never say they support a limited number of printers.
1,Two failed units - it's unreliable product,"In less than a year, I have had two 500GB NetCenter units fail. The same thing happened each time: system suddenly becomes inaccessible or available on my home network. There are two ways to access NetCenter: 1) using the provided EasyLink software to store/retrieve data; and 2) using a browser to access the admin console. I use the unit about once a month to back up my data. Very disappointed with this product."
3,"Nice drive, but power on scheme is an issue","This drive does everything it is supposed to. I have had it running flawlessly for a long time. However, if there is a power failure, or a long enough failure to run out a UPS, the drive needs to be manually restarted. This is a major pain in a remote environment and a nuisance in others. All the other devices I have running power back up after power is restored."
3,Interesting,"Interesting information but check with other sources before deciding to follow their recommendations e.g, taking B-Complex each day, which is generally not recommended."
5,A great fun rock album,"If your a fan of bands like Failure and Handsome you should check this one out. Shift is a bit happier than most bands in it's genre but there is nothing wrong with that as long as they rock, and guess what? They do! Plus they've got a girl drummer, you can never go wrong with that."
4,Troubadours,"This is not my favorite from Mr. Emmett. However, as always, Mr. Emmett has created and continues to create some of the finest moments in music. His music, whatever motif, within any time capsule will be remembered as a classic, one day."
5,Thorough compendium of chemical info on fungal secondary metabolites,"The 3-volume set arrived within mere days of having ordered it, and in perfect condition. As a compendium for structure elucidation, it's a very useful resource. For each compound the set provides a chemical structure, physical, chemical and spectroscopic data, purification method, source organism, biological activities if known and references to the literature. Each volume is indexed by compound name and precise molecular weight. This greatly facilitates searching for compounds in a mixture of unknowns with preliminary spectroscopic and mass data in hand."
4,Helpful Quickstudy for Composition,I love these Quickstudy Reference Guides. I had one for my Excel class and it packs a wallup in the information department. I plan on buying more in the future.
5,Collin Raye...The One of the most underrated music stars around,"Simply put, if you love ballads You will love Collin Rayes music, This album is a MUST have for music lovers, Country Music fans and people that just like good music.Their is not one single bad song on this CD."
5,wrong size,the description of the frog is not 9x16.5x9 as stated.it's more like 2x3x2. whats up with that?
2,never sleep alone after this!,"This movie was a real thriller which uses MPD to cunfuse the audience, but it wasn't very well made. The acting was poor, and it didn't make sense."
3,good but not great,"I followed the instructions on the packet and prepared my very first batch of kimchee. The coloring was off. The taste, after 5 days, was ok. This is a good but not great substitute of the kimchee I used to buy from the Korean supermarket.When I prepared my second batch, I wanted to have a red coloring, not the almost nude color from my 1st batch, I added some red pepper powder. It was a lot more spicy after this additive. Another change I made on my 2nd batch: I did not add water to the kimchee base, just sprinkled to the prepared nappa cabbage. I preferred this over adding water."
2,Not much luck with this,"I've only had Kim Chee purchased already prepared and jared... and I love it. But the one brand is my only reference, When I prepared this package it wasn't close to the flavor I was used to. I've tried 2 packages and varied the amount of salt in the presoak... which changed the flavor a lot, so I'll try again, but my hopes aren't real high."
2,"""The Discovery Channel"" Rave story","The director could have let us develop our own idea of the Rave scene, just filming different raves in different parts of the world (not just in CA)Leaving the images suggest us ""what"" is a rave , instead he filmed the opinion oif different DJ's and such ( the Raffaella Carra' looking trans is amazing) ( PS Raffaella Carra' is a very popular, and old, Italian showgirl)So you can just hear what those guys think about raves. They all obviuosly end with the ""no drugs!"" message. How original. The drug aspect of the rave scene is almost unmentioned, the story of the house-acid music is described in 3 minutes. The rest of the world raves not even mentioned ( what about Ibiza? Goa? The Love Parade in Berlin??)....END"
3,Relive the rave scene?,"Did you want to relive the rave scene with this movie? I did. As a serious LA raver from the late 90's and well into the 2000's as an adult electronica clubber, i've finally realized i'm over the whole rave-electronica scene after watching this movie. It is a great documentary if you're still in the rave scene(4-stars), but it made it all look totally ridiculous to me now. I can still appreciate trance and the dj's, but the whole dressing up, rolling, massives, staying up all night, after parties and retarded dancing are all such a turn off for me now. I've been in the scene for almost 10 years and always wondered when i would give it all up and move on like friends have way before me. I have not been in the scene for 4-5 years now and after watching this movie and not being able to relive the glory days, i realize now that i am finally freE!If you want to watch a fun ""E"" movie and still be able to enjoy it as an ex-raver, you will want to watch GO!"
2,Get Modulations its a lot better....,"This is not very good. It's more about teenage yanks toootally raggin out and being rad dude. This is not about the music or the scene and adds nothing at all to electronic music. Christ how did the yanks go so wrong... i mean what happened to Mr.Fingers/Juan Atkins/Derek May all we get from the states now is a bunch of loved up middleclass idiots who really want to be in rock bands... ssshhesh.Modulations is a much better film describing the progress of electronic music from Stockhausen, to its use in Jazz with Herbie Hancock and Teo Macereo, then Disco and onto to Detroit Techno and Acid House and over to England for the 2nd summer of love in 1989, then Rave, D n'B and electronica... Don't waste you time on this crap get Modulations instead..."
4,the U.S. didnt start rave,Although I fond this vid very good and informative I found the Neivert of the kids in the US rave scean very disturbing and surprising. Rave had been around in the UK (around 1987) and Australia (around 1989) (where I'm from) long before it started to take off in the US (around 1994/95) and to hear kids stating that the US where the ones to start rave was starting to [make me mad]We have had a strong rave scean here in Australia for well over a decade now and to see artist talking about the music that I love had how it evolved puts a bit grin on my faceThe only other part of the movie I didn't like was that it was very much only from the US point of view I felt that they could have explored the electronic music coming out of other countries as I feel some of the music only now starting to filter out of Australia in to the rest of the world is only giving you all a glimpse of just how divers a scean we have over here
3,cliche,"i don't know if i spelled it right. but the movie was cliche. it is supposed to be about the rave scene and the techno/electronic music scene, but basicly it is about clubbers tooting there own horns. way too focused on the california desert rave scene while altogether ingnoring London, Ibiza, and the rest of the great European scene. Did have a great look on the pro's and con's of drugs, which is good to see. It is documentery style, and some of the people they interviewed are just plain stupid. These people should not be allowed to reproduce."
2,not representative of the rave phenomenom,"This is not a movie, in a classic sense. This is a set of interviews of dj's & promoters. I'm fine with that however the djs that participates are not the best representations of the electronic industry. Where is Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyk, Sasha, Digweed, Dave Seaman, Deep Dish , Dj Dan... and countless other famous dj's? I understand that the budget might have been too small to invite one of those dj's mentioned above for an interview or so ...but in this movie there are lots of dj's that are not that well representative of an industry that's becomming smaller and smaller. For your money's worth, buy a breakbeat dance video where you will be more entretained than a documental wanna be..."
1,bad sale,"i would probably agree this is a good movie, but unfortunately I never got the opportunity to view it on account that i waited 4 days and then was told AFTER i purchased the video, it was sold in this person's store. bad business ethics if you ask me. So no, I'm not pleased with any of the services."
2,"should be called ""Raving 101""","this documentary takes a discovery channel approach at portraying what rave scene is about. if you've never been to a rave you might find it amusing, otherwise its just bunch of redundant stuff you've seen over and over again, with little substance. Some of the DJ interviews were cool but thats not enough to make this a worthy buy. probably the silliest part was when this girl tells you what to bring to a rave so make sure you have a pen and paper ready.if i was going to recommend one documentary from theese series it would be ""Modulations""."
5,Dora is here to stay!!!,"My preshool aged kids are nutz about Dora - and FINALLY a female heroine/charcter for them to follow! They have learned as many as 20 spanish words since we started watching and not only do they know how to just say them, they KNOW what they mean and what context to use them. Make sure you check out...onine games that your children can play!"
5,"Oh my gosh, I ate the whole bag","I bought this because I was looking for a hull-less corn. This is a very good tasting corn although I was surprised that it is lightly salted. For an all natural corn I didn't expect salt.A one oz. serving (28g) has 200mg of Sodium. For those watching your salt intake this one isn't a good choice. Personally I am a salt lover and I always tend to over salt my popcorn. Since this is already salted, I don't need to add any additional and the salt flavor is perfect. After having eaten the whole bag, I can still feel a slight salty taste in the corners of my mouth. And best of all, there are no hulls sticking to the back of my throat. This is definitely on my ""order again"" list.I have also found that after removing the outer wrap from the package it helps if I kneed the popcorn a bit so the majority of corn is in one layer. This way more of the kernels pop."
5,Lovin' this popcorn,A friend always buys this popcorn but in a jar. I'm too lazy and prefer putting a bag in the microwave so when I saw this I had to buy. What a treat! Very tasty - you don't miss the butter. I'm going to order another box soon.
3,Delicious but very salty,"This popcorn is delicious. If you are sharing one bag with two other people, I highly recommend. But if you customarily eat a whole bag by yourself, I would not recommend this. It has too much sodium and fat for my taste. Again, that's just my personal opinion. I really like natural popcorn (without a lot of extra things added); this wasn't natural enough for me."
5,A good healthier alternative,"I normally like popcorn that has a lot of added flavor (butter, cheddar, caramel, etc...) but I also wanted to have something healthier on hand for when I have more health conscious friends over. I didn't want plain popcorn though or anything that was so tasteless that I didn't want to eat it either though. I am happy to say that this is perfect for that. Because it is salted, I won't say that this is a healthy snack, but it is a much healthier option than most other types of popcorn and it still tastes great."
1,ALL KERNALS NO POPCORN....,Excessive kernals in bag after popping. Only pops about a quarter of the bag. I have ordered this product many times before and never had such a bad experience with quanity in the bag. I wrote to the co. and received NO RESPONSE from them.
2,Not My Preference,"Black popcorn was recommended to me by a friend. She swears that this popcorn is better than any other. However, I did not like it at all. I am not saying the product is not good......I am saying it is not my personal preference.I have had good luck with Amazon products but I just did not like this one."
3,time will tell if this stands up,"Its been several years now since the release of ""Suede"" and ""Dog Man Star"", and to me these albums have passed the test of time very nicely. When I first heard Coming Up, I really loved it. i thought the album was filled with great hooks, and cool lyrics. But to me, the album already sounds old. It'll be interesting to see if this record sounds as fresh in a few years, or if its just schlock rock. But Im enjoying it for now. I cannot however, put it in the same ballpark as Dog man Star, or the debut."
4,Suede is a unique band because of their sarcasm and humor.,"Though I'm more of a punk/ska type of guy, i enjoy listening to the British rock band known as Suede. I love ""Beautiful Ones"" because it displays the cynical mood of the band. ""Lazy"" is a song of tranquility and peace. Personally, one of my favorites is ""Filmstar"" because I laugh at their satire towards a stereotypical celebrity. I also love their British voices and I always say that ""you can't buy that kind of voice."" I love listening to this with my friend because it makes us laugh."
2,Going Down,"I listened to this album for the first time with trepidation, as ""Suede"" and ""Dog Man Star"" are two of my favourite albums ever, and worried that the loss of Bernard Butler was going to be fatal. Unfortunately, I found ""Coming Up"" shallow and forgetable. After a few listens it becomes grating and I can't bear to listen to it anymore. ""Saturday Night"" is the nearest thing to previous glories but even that isn't quite there. Richard Oakes is just copying, and I'm not sure what Neil Codling adds other than to the song-writing effort. It hurts to slag Suede as they WERE one of my favourite bands and the first two albums will always be special to me (and I went to school with Neil Codling so it feels like I'm having a go at a mate) but really this album isn't very good. Sorry."
2,average,"in some ways a return to form after a rather depressing second album, this one is a little too light and bubble-gummy, largely saved by the most quintessential suede song ever written ""picnic by the motorway"". Too many songs are throwaways and begs the question why the single ""Trash""'s b-side ""Every Monday Morning Comes"" wasn't included on the album.There is little direction shown by the band which seems to be now treading water."
4,It is great,"It is so nice to listen to such a great album, even if the band has lost its soul without Bernard Butler. I think you should buy their first two albums which aren't so commercial. But in fact, they are all great."
3,Suede becomes a cliche of their own sound,"With Bernard Butler out of the way Brett Anderson is free to indulge himself in delusions of stardom and rock star glory . . . and this is what happens: a directionless album that sounds like nothing so much as an imitation of Brit-pop (and early Suede) cliches. Though it lacks the grace and fury of earlier Suede, Coming Up still manages to amuse and entertain with the ecstasy-driven ""Beautiful Ones"" and the self-mocking ""Filmstar"". And in spite of the album's overall soul-lessness the closing song ""Saturday Night"" is definitely up to par with anything off of Dog Man Star."
4,Suede's best album *,"Soaring melodies, amazing vocals, gritty guitars and tight drums intertwine in some of the best pop songs ever written. Every song is great. There is a good T. Rex & Marc Bolan influence in a few songs, which is always welcome. This is easily one the best albums of the 90's. The melodies are so strong, it's really beyond words. This is classic ""Brit Pop"" at it's peak. Buy this cd, and play it loud."
3,Guilty pleasure.,"Coming Up is a fun album and you can see why Suede made it after the great but a bit suffocating Dog Man Star and going separate ways with original guitarist Bernard Butler. There's lots of songs with loud, catchy guitar hooks about going out and experiencing life in Brett Anderson's decadence-filled London. Half the album charted as singles and there are no real low spots.As great as this all sounds, Anderson sings in a touch too-high voice throughout and combined with the sugary production pushes the album into some sort of glam/kiddie-pop territory that hurts its longevity. Coming Up should bring back a lot of fond memories for those who played it growing up but it's a bit hard not to wince at almost 10 years on."
4,Suede change their tune with their new guitarist,"Described by singer Brett Anderson as Suede's ""party album"", 1996's Coming Up offers up 10 happy, melody-heavy songs in the wake of the apocalyptic message of 1994's Dog Man Star. Coming Up has 10 songs, all concise slices of Britain, but this time quite a bit cheerier. New guitarist Richard Oakes maintains Butler's impeccable technique but tightens it up to drive the songs. Standout cuts include Trash, Lazy, Beutiful Ones, Picnic by the Motorway, and Saturday Night. And the aching By the Sea may be Suede's 2nd best ballad, right behind The Wild Ones."
4,Very Nice Compilation.,"With the exception of the first two works, this anthology of short films is really quite good. Several are real standouts, particularly the hugely funny and entertaining ""Latch Key."" The filmmaker who did that one has s a very bright future indeed. But, other films on the disc are also quite striking. This is well worth your investment - the perfect compilation of films to show to friends after making a batch of popcorn or retiring from a nice dinner."
2,Boys Briefs 3,As in some of the other Boys Briefs I reviewed. There is No Nudity or sexual activity in any of these. Something I need and am looking for when ordering DVDs like this.
1,void like the plague,"Why is that so many film-makers these days believe staring at a black screen (with half-second intervals of illumination) is artisitic? It is pretentious and irritating. Oh -- there are the unpleasant grunting noises as well. This is puerile film making -- more like a video game than a narrative. When the inevitable creature sound is heard from the dark, I hoped it would eat the protagonist on the spot and spare me the rest of this plodding, pointless exercise. There have been many films I have disliked, but few that made me feel I had been robbed. This one made me want to demand my money back."
2,"Pointless, rambling, literally leaves you in the dark...","I tried all the way through this film to the end to like it. It was too dark too see anything, no resolution was offered and no apparent plot beyond some kind of tree that provided power to cities in the future at the apparent cost of human lives. I felt cheated at the end that no clear explanation was forthcoming. I can't for the life of me understand why anyone thought this film was award winning or ground breaking."

1,piece of crap,Don't waste your time or your money on this stinker. What a worthless piece of crap. The entire film made no sense and the cinematography was outlandish. Some guy crawling through a cave for some unknown reason is not my idea of entertainment. I would rather sit and watch a blade of grass grow then ever watch this movie again. I am a die hard horror/scifi flick fan and I believe in giving every film at least an honest chance of giving me something new or interesting but this one offers absolutely nothing. Thank the gods and Amazon for fast forward which is the only way I could get to the end.
1,Movie order,"the service as far as receiving it in time was excellent, I just didn't end up liking the movie."
1,too long and off beat,"Seeing the content of the story line, Man wakes up in a cave not knowing who he is and why he woke up in a cave, sounds good, right? Well, the whole movie keeps you in the story only because you want it to be more, so you watch and wait for the story to open up and be interesting. The problem is, you get to the end and wish you had done something else, rather tan waiste all this time watching this movie."
2,Awful derivative movie but...beautiful,"This is a beautifully shot movie (if you like dark movies). It's very well done. However, it's also an awful and boring movie. It drags too long in places and the story isn't explained well (if at all). It feels a bit like the movie ""the descent"" except worse.3 stars because it looks good. 1 star for everything else. It might be worth a rental or purchase if you like these types of movies. I'll never watch it again."
2,Familiar Nightmare,"I've had a nightmare like this where I was trying to find a bathroom. I keep searching while all the time running into strange situations and tight spaces. It is always dark and confusing. Finally I wake up. I watched the whole movie, just never woke up."
1,Do not watch this movi,"This movie was terrible. It was difficult to understand the point of the entire thing, even after it ended... do not waste your time."
2,The movie craaaaawwwwls...,"A man covered in mud crawling through a dark tunnel, breathing and crawling, crawling and breathing, for 10 minutes! then the credits role. That should have indicated to me to press ""stop"" on the dvd player. But no. I had to waste the full 90 minutes of my life. The entire dialog of this movie must fill only one page. The ""story"" is so obscure that the writers had to make a little cartoon animation at the end to explain it, and it still made very little sense. The guy crawls and climbs through various rooms, tunnels, tree roots, and goes nowhere. If this was a student film, the prerequisite being that the director had to use whatever rubber tubes, garbage bags, and tree branches could be found just lying around, and a strobe light, then OK. It might get a passing grade. But as a commercial release, nah. This movie should have been titled ""crawl,"" and boy, does it ever."
1,What the.....,I watched this.. expecting something cool like the cover.. you know.. alien trees or something.. .. what you is a confused mess of sea sick making camera work of someone slowly walking around in the dark.. .. then ends up on the surface.. and that is all there is.
4,Great,"The movie had good acting and excellent special effects, even for today's technology. As impressive and as far ahead of itself the special effects were in the movie 2001 and the time period of the late 60's, this movie is, you won't be dissapointed. It's one of those movies that have you saying, HMM! Make sure you watch 2001 A Space Oydessy first. If you don't the movie probably won't make much sense to you. You probably would never have thought that this movie would present Artificial Intelligence so uniquely. That's all I'm saying. Enjoy"
4,S. Green,"Like many other reviewers, I would concur this is a love or hate it movie... and most anyone afflicted by low brow hollywood blockbusters will undoubtably hate this movie. There are plenty of reviews that provide details of the movie, so I won't go there. I will suggest the brainiacs that dare venture into this film watch for a number of clever dichotomies and consider the deeper and evolving social commentary. Nonetheless, this movie isn't brilliant. The acting is sub par. The ending explains more than necessary (although many more would likely hate the movie without such an ending). I'm glad I watched it and have no regrets. Here are other films I find fascinating: City of Lost Children, Blade Runner, Fifth Element, Logan's Run, and Soylent Green. My only challenge is finding whom I might recommend this film to."
2,dark and scary,If you like a little scare fright type movie you might like this one. They certainly saved on set cost with everything being filmed in pitch dark. I gave this movie a chance to get going and I kept finding myself lost and then distracted so eventually bailed and went on to find another movie to watch. For someone else it might be an entirely different experience.
1,C.r.a.p.,So many B movies on Amazon Prime. Really this movie was dark and unexciting I think I fell asleep watching it.
1,Own light source required.,"There is nothing too see, literally. Unless annoying flickering light and impenetrable darkness mashed up together is enough to make a motion picture. Poor cinematography, recycled storyline, and oh so golly monsters. You are better off dozing off for an hour, I guarantee any dream you may have will be far more entertaining."
1,"Great Movie, Epic Blu-Ray Failure","This movie was great. It was very creepy and atmospheric. However, I found myself to be infuriated by the idiocy of the Blu-Ray transfer. I hate dubbed movies. I believe that a movie should be watched as the director intended it to be seen, and in the language it was created in. I always watch foreign language films in the language with subtitles enabled. However, on this Blu-Ray, there is NO OPTION to watch the movie in the original language (French) without going into the special features and selecting it... IN STANDARD DEFINITION! In HD, one can only watch the English or Spanish dubbed version. To recap, a brilliant film and a truly despicable shortcoming on the Blu-Ray. I cannot believe the ignorance of the people who formatted this."
3,good but not fantastic,"The Essex Green, although they don't measure up to the standards of the E6-east giants (The Olivia Tremor Control and Neutral Milk Hotel), are better than many of their labelmates, such as The Apples in Stereo, Elf Power, and Beulah. This album consists mostly of songs that are fun but not amazing, although a few songs--""Sun"", ""Mrs. Bean"", ""Primrose"" and ""Tinker""--stand out as excellent.By the way, I don't really buy the comparisons to the Zombies, except for the beginning of ""Big Green Tree"" (which is pretty much lifted from ""She's Not There"")..."
1,Annoying yet immature and poorly produced,"I highly recommend EG's two more recent albums -- Cannibal Sea and The Long Goodbye are excellent -- but this CD exposes all the shortcomings of a band that's just getting started. Annoying melodies, immature songwriting and murky production values have relegated this CD to my dustbin. On second thought, I do need another coaster for my coffee table...."
5,Excellent,I ordered this book as soon as my daughter learned she had to have the surgery - this book is informative and written in language that everyone can understand - it has answered so many questions and helped her prepare better for the surgery.
5,You Need This Book!,"I can't think of anything missing from this book. It answers every question you could think of and details, in clear and simple language, exactly what you need to know and what your experience will be like. It also fully explains the nature of scoliosis and the various surgical options, as well as some of the alternative therapies. The topics range from how to pick a surgeon, how to arrange your life prior to the surgery, what to take to the hospital with you, what exactly your hospital experience will be like, to how and when you can try for sex after the surgery. The best thing about it is that it was written not by a surgeon who performs the surgery, but by a man who actually had the surgery himself. This is what will prepare you the best for the surgery. I read every scoliosis book out there but they all seemed lacking after reading this one."
5,Tremendous work!,"My wife is facing scoliosis surgery in a few weeks. I read the book first, and now Sue is reading it. David Wolpert presents the topic in such an understandable fashion. It was quite a change from the information you receive from the medical professionals. I want to thank the author for easing my mind on many of the uncertainties we'll be facing. Worth it's weight in GOLD!"
5,Scoliosis Surgery: The Definitive Patient's Reference (3rd Edition) (Purchased on 11/29/2007),"Excellent sourcebook from patient's perspective written in an understandable manner. Very direct, to the point and uncluttered by superflous information. I would recommend it to anyone who is planning to have the scolisis surgery and for their caretakers."
3,"Works well, wears poorly","I bought this rope to help me get up from deepwater slalom starts. The rope does work and did allow me and other family members to get up. However, the rope is wearing badly (many stands/fibers are breaking for no apparent reason)and the handle is wearing apart. Considering I am meticulous about handling and care of the rope I downgraded the rating-but it does help tremedously getting up on a slalom ski."
5,European Bath Soap,"My wife is German and although we have lived both here in the USA and in Germany, my favorite bath soap is Speick. It has a clean almost antiseptic aroma that stays with you but doesn't overwhelm.When my last bar ran out this summer, panic ensued in our household. Thankfully, Amazon, the Internet and the small entrepenuer who works through Amazon quickly provided the answer. The price is a little high but well worth it to me and the delivery time is great. Highly recommended."
5,Speick is the Grappa of soap,"I can't explain, even to myself, why I like Grappa. The taste is close to kerosene, but I like it.I can't explain, even to myself, why I like Speick. I can't say it smells good, but I like it. The smell is unlike any other soap I've used, and without knowing why exactly, I now have Speick after shave, and Speick shave soap.If you try it, you'll probably like it a lot. Maybe the why part doesn't matter."
4,Very good but become very expensive,"I am utilizing that soap about 5 years. It has great fragnance and is really high quality made, but just only disadvantage is that it became 3 times expensive, compairing to 2009."
4,Useful,"A useful and compact guide, focused on Rocky Mountain National Park and the nearby towns of Estes Park and Grand Lake. Practical tips. The chapters on day hikes included something for everyone -- trails ranging from 1/2 mile very easy trails to very difficult trails. The maps were a little difficult to read. A useful addition would be a fold-out color map."
4,For Riders of the Cerf Board,"Published in 1944 under rules from the War Production Board in order ""to conserve materials and manpower"" this book is a ""collection of anecdotes and stories, mostly humorous"", dedicated ""to all the people whose wit or lack of it made this volume possible"". Illustrated by Carl Rose, whose drawings are the type you just do not see in books anymore. This is truly for someone who is a fan of Mr. Cerf's. A lot of the stories and jokes went over my head, and there were plenty of unfunny items. The only reason for this is the time frame. As Mr. Cerf has pointed out, certain tellings of jokes have a limited lifespan. The chapters include such topics as Hollywood, The Literary Life, animal stories, War stories, and a chapter of ghost tales. Quite honestly this was the book I used on several occasions to put myself to sleep (as with all of Mr. Cerf's books) but I can tell you, I had no nightmares on those nights. I slept with content."
5,You Love it,"The Sampler is the Bomb,the best Song for me is 6 in tha Morning-ALT,Slow Pain and Frost have good Songz."
2,A struggle to read,"Nice plot and all, but the writing was boring. DULL! It was a struggle to continue reading. The setting was creative, but the lackluster characters made the book a difficult one to complete."
4,engrossing read,I was pulled into the story with the first paragraph. The author dives right into the story without preamble. Tepper then gives out more and more needed information as you get deeper into the book. The examintion of male and female roles is fascinting but not one sided. I really enjoyed it. Give it a read... or two!
2,Foreshadowing shoulding be 90% of a book,"Tepper has two themes close to her heart.First, that some people (moslty those she doesn't agree with) should just be killed, they can't be reasoned with and punishment is just cruelty. (She's been preaching that, and killing off the religious types she disdains, since The True Game novels).Second, that the universe is filled with wonderful, loving, ecologically balanced aliens with only humans as the disruptive source (ok, she dropped that in Grass, but it is a constant theme otherwise).She writes well, but I long for something more from her."
1,I have to disagree with the rest....,"I have been reading Tepper for many years. This is by far one of her most predictable plot-lines. Anyone familiar with feminist thought will know exactly what is happening and why. The symbolism is too obvious. I like Tepper for her unusual connections and creations of complex new ways of viewing old worn out ideas. This book is sorely lacking in either. :o(I love Tepper, but not this book. I left it in a common room at a local college dormatory in a small Mormon town for whom ever wished to read it. I figured, knowing the lack of feminist education in the area, that the teen age girls who might pick it up might actually be enchanted or at least educated."
3,"All in all, a very good read","An enjoyable, intricate, amazingly detailed story. I was impressed with the way the story came together. It's one of the better books I've read recently. However, I've rarely seen breastfeeding portrayed in a more negative way, and this prevented me from a fullfilling empathy with the characters. So while I enjoyed reading this book, I wouldn't buy it or read it again. But if you haven't read it yet, I'd encourage you to do so. It's worth a read."
4,candid and refreshing,"There is a great edge to the photos in this book and a real sense that NERVE has it's finger on the pulse of what's ""hot""."
2,"The Gita as it is, only not","I am thankful that I purchased first, a basic uncommented Gita. Otherwise, I might have formed an extremely negative opinion of the book given my experience with this one. Reading the book was a struggle, because the author's hostile views towards other views and women and the poor were shocking. I would be reading along and then it was like someone hit me in the head with a stick. I eventually gave up on it. If you want a Gita with excellent commentary, try the Essence of the Bhagavad Gita by Paramhansa Yogananda. Or better yet, get one without any commentary at all and see what enlightenment comes to you."
3,The Gita As It Was,"As if a text from Homer's Iliad had become embroidered to tell a spiritual tale, the Bhagavad Gita resonates with the antiquity of great myths, the Mahabharata. Ay there's the rub. The text that we have of this classic gem is increasingly coming under scrutiny as a corrupt text, mostly later interpolations, suffering a fate analogous to that of the Bible in an age of Biblical Criticism. A little known work called The Gita As It Was, Rediscovering the Original Bhagavadgita. by Phulgenda Sinha, should be indispensable reading for anyone interested in the stunning fact that the original Gita was a non-theistic text. The deception and complete transformation of the sutras reveals a palimpsest indeed, upon which the shadow side of Indian spiritual history has been written."
4,Excellent Book.,This is a wonderful book for individuals who wish to understand the Gita. The meanings can be easily understood.
2,Bhagavad Gita as it is . it is not as it is,"This version of the gita was commented by Prabhupada; a sincere truth seeker and leader of HK movement. The only problem is that along with any verse he writes 5 pages of comment; so this Bhagavad gita is not as it is but as he was able to see it. I am not arguing whether the commentary is good or not; the fact which remains is that this gita it is not ""as it is"". In order to get such a book you have to buy one without any commentary."
4,"Excellent book, good commentary","I gave only 4 stars for this book as I really like it and regard as one of the best book ever written, but I refer to the original Bhagavad-gita and in this review I have to review what Prabhupada has made, Prabhupada didn't write the Gita. :) Prabhupada's translations are good and include everything, including word-by-word translations and thus deserves the book's name as being ""as it is"", however, the commentaries, as is usual for Prabhupada, could have been less harsh. But well, you don't have to read them. The book is for sure worth reading."
4,A Beautiful Book,"This is a beautiful book. The conversation between the warrior Arjuna and his cousin and charioteer, Lord Krns, on the batlefield of Kuruksetra, demonstrates the essence of the Vedic spirit. The sense of spiritual intoxication is enchanting, but unlike other Upanisads, however, too much emohasis is placed upon obedience to authority and there are many theological inconsistencies in the text. Despite the more enlightened aspects of Krsna's advice, one cannot forget that it he he who is trying to convince Arjuna to go out and kill his friends and relatives on a battlefield when Arjuna himself is overcome with compassion for his fellow human beings."
1,Are women inferior?,"This appeared to be an interesting interpretation, until I reached the page where the author, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, described women as inferior beings. The book then went into recycling, where it belongs! Don't waste your time or money on this book."
1,font issue,Downloaded sample of this ebook on kindle for android on galaxy tab 620. And I can see problems in display of some words. Its displayed as boxes. Words like Krishna is displayed as k''''na. Consider these triangles as boxes. I know its some kind of issue with fonts. Don't know how to fix. Good I downloaded sample before buying.
2,bhagavad-gita as it is,"It was my mistake cause I didn't pay atention to what I was purchasing. All I wanted was a good version in english of The Bhagavad- Gita, without comments. This book is mostly, comments and interpretations of the poem, and the poem itself is spreaded among the ideas of Baktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. If you can suggest, I will buy another book,just an english version of the original poem."
5,The original word of God,"Amazing details. No interpretation, true to its title ""As it is"".Take this test: If, after reading the word of God, you come to the same conclusion that Arjuna came up with after hearing the Lord's word directly in first person, you know your conclusion is right and the Bhagavad-Gita you read didn't dilute or change the original message.You wouldn't get the same message in Bhagavad-Gita by any other author other than His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada."
1,Purports spoil this book,"While purchasing this book, I was hoping this to be an unadulterated translation of the original Bhagavad Gita - and I must say I was disappointed. The author structures the book well, for each original verse in Sanskrit, the English transliteration, the English translation and ""purport"" come subsequently. The issue I have is with the author's ""PURPORTS"". In almost all ""purports"" , the author liberally uses the term ""Krsna consciousness"", which makes me think whether the purports actually convey the meaning of the verses or whether they convey author's version of meaning. I am inclined towards the latter, and I have stopped reading the purports and have focused on the translations alone. But the fact that purports occupy major portion of the book, I would recommend readers not to buy the book, if you plan to ignore the author's purports. I would NOT recommend this book, even for beginners."
2,Bhagavad-gita as it is,"This book is not the original book written by A.C. Bhaktivedanta swami, but has been rewritten by his unqualified disciples who have changed almost the entire manuscript against A.C. Bhaktivedanta's permission. He had written that not one word should be changed in his books. Also stated by swmi was that one should be very careful to not follow a guru who is not pure in heart, and that milk touched by the lips of a serpant have poisonous affects. Bring back the original manuscript!"
1,As It Is NOT,"I've read the Bhagavad Gita for 35 years and it has guided my life spirtually. This commentary (including aspects of the translation) is a travesty, a blatant attempt to twist the Gita's philosophy to justify the Hare Krishna movement's very screwy philosophy. The commentary bears the same relationship to the Gita as the Book of Mormon does to the Bible. It is so off base as to be laughable except for the fact that some unwitting soul may actually buy it thinking he's getting an accurate commentary on the Bhagavad Gita. Read the Bhagavad Gita, Not ""The Bhagavad Gita As it Is."" Buyer Beware."
2,"This is a very ""Popular"" book, unfortunately....","I have read many versions and am sorry to say that this version is too opinionated and concentrates mostly on propaganda of Krishna consciousness. It is like reading a badly written bible where you find the author keep repeating the same things over and over again and missing the whole point...If you are reading the Gita with the intention of spiritual advancement and getting an indepth understanding of the philosophy of lord Krishna, try reading the works of great scholars like Sankaracharya. I am quoting Sankaracharya because his work on the Gita is very impartial and indepth."
2,From an atheist,"I began reading this book - I am still in the process - with the desire to understand Hinduism better. The purports, while helpful in some cases, I am finding to be incredibly obnoxious. Not only from an atheist's point of view, but from any person of differing opinion, the repeated sentences of ""those too ignorant to understand,"" or ""less intelligent,"" are starting to really taint this book. If I had wanted to understand how condescending this guy was, I could've figured it out some other way besides reading this book. It's a shame, because he is trying to convey the essence of Hinduism and the Krishna consciousness movement, and through his actions, making me wonder if this condescension is not an isolated occurrence..."
5,Another site with glowing reviews of this book by scholars,"Further to my earlier message regarding the fact that many reviews here which condemn this book are obviously made by persons who are not experts nor scholars in the subject matter, well, here's another site where the sincere seeker can find the opnion of many learned scholarsA sincere reader of this book will find it reveals all mysteries of the self, of the universe, of God and of the nature of our relationship with him in a very accurate and wonderful way.Do see the reviews at http://www.vedatrust.com/spreviews.htmand the earlier mentioned one at www.asitis.com/reviewsmay lord krishna bless you in your search for the Absolute Truth"
5,better than print,"The kindle version makes reading this sacred book...very very easy. There is simply no other translation of the Gita, that gives you the distilled, uncorrupted version of this classic"
2,"Bhagavad ""as it is"" to Hare Krishna Movement","I have studied and benefited from repeated readings several translations /commentaries of the Gita for 35 years. Upon reading this commentary I noticed some of the interpretations were 180 degrees different from anything I'd read before; that's the point, I believe, of adding ""As it is"" to the Bhagavad Gita's title. One thing that is repeadedly harped on is that all other commentaries are misguided and the Krishna devotees should avoid reading them, much better than here.Ahem. Might I direct you to Eknath Easwaran's non-sectarian and wonderful 3 volume commentary and translation of the Bhagavad Gita. Volume one is entitle ""The End of Sorrow."" This is the best place to begin, in my honest opinion."
2,Bhagavad-Gita As It Is,I didn't like this book because it is a 1983 revised edition. Is is not the original book that Bhaktivedanta had wrote and at the back of the book it has Mohandas Gandhi which it was not suppose to be there because he mixed religion with politics. I was disappointed so I sold the book and got the 1972 Macmillan edition which is the right one that Bhaktivedanta wrote.

3,Strong Hare Krshna slant,"Many English translations of the Bhagavad-Gita realize that most of its readers are not Indian Hindus and therefore present it in such a way that a Westerner can easily read it and interpret it however he wishes. This is NOT one of those translations.The late A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was the man who brought Hare Krshna (a cultic sect of Hinduism) to the United States in the '50s and '60s. Today you can find his followers trying to sell you Hare Krshna books in the Los Angeles airport.In his translation of the Gita he is not attemtping to present Hinduism or the ancient Vedas or modern new age spirituality. He is unapologetically promoting Hare Krshna. He doesn't present it as one possible truth but rather as the ultimate truth.I guess the translation itself is alright, but it's the commentary I can do without. Swami's near-constant commentary is in-your-face and cynical of all things that are non-Hare Krshna."
2,Disappointed,"First page I flipped to read, ""Why do women w/ low esteem cut themselves when a cosmetic surgeon can do it for them?"" or ""If men thought God was a woman, would they still die and kill for Her?"" I bought this book for friends deployed to Iraq needing comic relief but instead its attempts too much 'thought provoking' why's ... not appropriate for where I'm sending it and just not a fun book to read overall."
4,More great remixes from the Florida based act,"A wider selection of groups and acts to be remixed than the previous volume which tended to concentrate more on other electronic artists work.Top tracks are remixes of Garbage's 'Milk' turning it into a techno groover, and the great remix of Banco de Gaia's 'Drunk as a Monk', which is transformed into a breakbeat techno piece.A very good addition to your electronic and dance music collection."
3,Answer to the Question,The name of the song is O.B.E. which stands for Out of Body Experience. It is a sample of Precious Things by Tori Amos. You can find the song on Urbal Beats vol. 1As far as the album is concerned there are some great songs and some blah songs. I find Track 2 and 3 to be excellent.
2,Porno Music Overlay,"Wow, imagine trying to watch Lance Armstrong win an exciting mountain stage of the Tour while some synthesizer/porno music that is so loud you can't even hear the inane commentary of Phil Liggett or Paul Sherwin plays over the imagery? Well, this is what watching this DVD is like. And just as inexplicably as this ""music"" begins it sometimes, blessedly, ends. Sometimes it ends before the best part of the stage is over and sometimes not. Apparently the production team was high when they dumped this garbage on top of the video, or they were watching a porno and just happened to record some of the music. Either way, you'll have a hard time ignoring it. I say to myself, how dumb do people really have to be to think that something like this is actually a good idea? Well, look at who's president. Nuf said."
4,Everglades Outlaw,"This was a very nicely done video, compilation of interviews with the author and local photography and video's. Good florida stuff!"
1,Self Deluded,"Graham writes ""the God of Islam is not the God of the Christian faith"". Oh really? Graham has obviously not read the Christian Bible. The Name is Graham's attempt to give himself a aura of legitimacy. Most of the book is devoted to describing his recent ""great moments"". Graham Jr. has some big shoes to fill and this book and his inflamatory public statements proves he hasn't a clue how to do it."
3,Duck Deleted,"Just received this, as pictured but WITHOUT the rubber duck. Not a huge deal, as the recipient of this gif probably won't know. But either the picture is wrong or mine was somehow mispacked."
5,laptop case,The portfolio is even better than I expected. Plenty of room for my laptop and adapter. Very stylish and love the pink.
4,Posh,"Item look exactly as described. I feel like its the most posh looking laptop bag I've seen! It would be great if it could come to fit a 13"" macbook pro though 'cos it's a bit big for me."
4,really cute bag,"This is a great bag if you are looking for a thin fashionable laptop case. It is not sophisticated or classy by any means. It holds THE laptop really good and has good protection. The faux croc material looks much faker in real life. I have a 14 inCH laptop and it fits just right with the little pouch next to it. If your laptop is any bigger, you will have to do without the pouch and without it, there will be no room for a charger. My charger fits in the pouch really snug. So far, I am enjoying this case because I wanted something that was really cute and not bulgy and this does the job."
4,A real Bang for your buck.,A real nice bike for the price. Easy to assemble and adjust. My wife really likes it.
4,"Every time you kiss me, hits me like a punch!","This was the third, and last, album by Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels. Unlike their previous albums, which featured a lot of covers of recent R&B hits, this album consists almost entirely of original material (the exception being a cover of Dionne Warwick's hit ""Walk On By"", which was added to the album at the last minute). The best known song here is the title hit, but there are a lot of other great songs like ""Takin' All I Can Get"", ""I Never Had It Better"" and ""I'd Rather Go To Jail"". The use of originals rather than covers makes this Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels best album, in my opinion. The CD adds three bonus tracks, which were all originally released as singles."
5,Nice quick short crossover.,That short link makes it great with the Ethernet cable I already carry. Helps for crossover when I need to direct to a device from my laptop without a switch.
2,"Probably works for 100Mbit cards, does not work for Gbit cards",It probably does not have all pairs used by GBit crossed over.Hence not working when you have a GBit card in your computer.
2,Nice coffee maker --- with some electrical issues.,"We purchased this model about a year ago and we've been pleased with it. It looks nice and it doesn't take up much counter space. Recently it stopped working so we purchased another one just like it. Within two weeks the new one stopped working as well. Same problem -- it won't turn on. Bad luck perhaps, but I would recommend hanging on to your receipt."
2,"Great idea, but very disappointing durability.","Got this for my 9 year old's birthday. She used it for 3 pages of her journal and then the pen ran out of invisible ink. UTTERLY USELESS AND DISAPPOINTING! What started out as one of the best presents with a fun and exciting purpose ended up as a disappointing let down. The idea of the journal is great, but the durability of it was a big let-down. In all fairness, maybe it was an anomoly. I don't know. I didn't contact the company to return it. Maybe they would have replaced it. But the point is....I shouldn't have to after 3 pages of writing in a journal."
3,Overrated,"After reading all the wildly enthusiastic reviews of this album, I bought it, thinking I must have missed out on an obscure classic the first time around. After listening to it a couple of times, I don't think so.The instrumentation on this record is excellent, and you may want to buy it for that reason alone. But the lyrics are mediocre at best. The songs are not at all memorable or inspiring to me. After listening to it all the way through, what does it add up to? To me, not a lot."
2,...,"Sometimes there really is a good reason why an album remains in relative obscurity. But these days, FOREVER CHANGES gets more than its share of attention thanks to some obviously burned-out hippies that have become music critics.This album does sound dated, stuck in the sixties like the Monkees. There is a weirdness to it which includes flamenco-style guitar and lyrics like ""Oh the snot has caked against my pants/It has turned into crystal"" (whatever floats yer boat), but most of it borders on ATONALITY as well as notes and chord progressions that simply DO NOT WORK. These characteristics make for an uncomfortable listen, but maybe I'd feel differently ON ACID."
2,"forgettable then, forgettable now","I bought this album not long after its original release on vinyl. My own opinion: Arthur Lee didn't have much of a voice, his lyrics had all the subtlety and poetry of a jackhammer, David Angel's arrangements are some of the cheesiest ever recorded, and The Red Telephone and You Set the Scene are among the most embarrassingly awful songs in rock history. I'll never understand why many people now think this is a great album. It was undeniably creative in places but also hopelessly heavy-handed, and most of it literally makes me cringe. Other than Alone Again Or, I really *never* want to hear any of these songs again. To put this on the same footing with the best of Tim Buckley and Nick Drake is laughable in my view, let alone the Beatles and Dylan."
2,Dated,"This album sounds like generic 60s oldies that you hear every time you go to the dentist or when your aunt is driving.The first two songs are good... but only good when compared to the rest of the album or the utter garbage of the period. Way back in '67, there was good music. There was great music... Beefheart, Hendrix, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, the Beatles and Stones, the Doors, the 13th Floor Elevators, Scott Walker and the Walker Brothers, and the flippin' Velvet Underground. Syd Barrett was helming Pink Floyd at their best, Can were forming, Van Morrison was coming into his own, and Magic Sam was working it out. All in all, a very fertile period. Do not waste your time or money on this album. There's plenty of good stuff out there for you."
4,California Sounds,"Like the Beach Boys ""Pet Sounds"", This album should be called California Sounds. It has the sound and the fervor of a California drive or a California night during the time period. The musical sections are beautifully put together and the singing is very good. This album was something i had never even heard of before. After i listened to it I decided to tell all my friends about it. It has great grooves and even better atmosphere. It is definately an album that is good for a long drive."
5,TOTAL 1960's/FOREVER CLASSIC,"ONE OF MY TOP 5 FAVE ALBUMS EVER, AND I LIVE EAT BREATHE MUSIC. THE LYRICS ARE INCREDIBLE, EVEN MORE BRILLIANT THAN DYLAN AT HIS BEST...THE MELODIES ARE EERIE, GORGEOUS...IT'S EVERYTHING HANGING OUT ON SUNSET STRIP, L.A. IN 1967 MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE. IT IS A FAULTLESS ALBUM. EVEN THE SLIGHT CHEESINESS HERE AND THERE ONLY ADDS TO ITS GREATNESS. IT'S LIKE BEING 9 AND EATING SWEET CEREAL FOR BREAKFAST AT THE BEGINNING OF A SUNNY, LONG ACTION PACKED SATURDAY IN TREE-HOUSES AND ON MINI-BIKES IN CALIFORNIA. HEAR IT AND BE ""forever changed..."" COLEEN TOEWS"
1,This is a masterpiece???,"This is a 5 star ""masterpiece""????I just cannot believe all the accolades and sky high rhetoric written about this hunk of junk!! This album sounds like the soundtrack of some C grade wannabe hippie movie made in the late 60s that fails miserably and is already outdated when it comes out (you know the type). For you folks out there that never heard this album before, save yourself the acid indigestion and the waste of $10 and DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! I'd rather listen to a buzz saw cut through 10 miles of rusty nails than to hear this again."
1,boring,I grew up in the 60's and 70's and never heard of this band and now know why. Not happy with it. Boring. Wish I had not bought it.
5,Most Overlooked album ?,This masterpiece gets my vote for most overlooked masterpiece released in popular music. Love's third record is his crowning achievment and one of the best rock albums of the 60s.
5,let me count the ways...,The best album released in 1967 without a doubt. And yes I know that's a profound statement to be making.
3,"Interesting, but overrated","This is certainly one of the more creative efforts to emerge from the late '60s scene, blending a variety of folk, psychedelic and pop styles. Yet the disc simply doesn't live up to the lavish praise critics have heaped on it since its reissue. There are too few hooks, and the production sounds both too slick for its time and outdated for this time. Witness the Herb Alpert-style horns and the kind of string arrangements that turned people off of The Doors' ""Soft Parade."" If you're looking for a forgotten masterpiece from this era, you're better off searching out Quicksilver Messenger Service or Moby Grape."
3,Cool Album,"while this Album sounds very much of it's time&place, there is no denying the Creativity&Overall sparks that are felt throughout this Album. Arthur Lee RIP who brought the Vision. this Band's overall tone&Feel has been Covered by a wide range of acts over the years. this album has a certain mood&Feel that will stay with you."
2,A priceless journey to a time when the music was real....,"When I put the disc in my C.D. player, it would have been a lot safer if I had been home instead of driving my car. My Porsche quickly morphed into a VW Beetle with a peace-sign painted across the hood. Goose-bumps rippled up my arms as a rush of warmth overcame me. The vocals and guitar pushed me through the openning of the time-warp as I was thrust into an era I still miss dearly. This album is nothing short of SUPERB! I still don't know how I got to work that day. Arthur Lee and the band had IT. Tomorrow I'm going to unwrap Bathing at Baxter's and listen to it on my drive. With any luck, I'll end up in Frisco...."
3,Long live Arthur Lee!,"I bought the CD right after legendary guitarist and vocalist Arthur Lee died on August 3 to replace the vinyl album I'd lost many years ago. It's still a great album, and I've listened to it many times since summer. Lee, who had his own personal demons to contend with, made great music nonetheless!"
1,"great album, bad quality","Please, spend a few extra dollars and get the new Rhino edition. I was unfortunate enough to buy this version only one month before the new one was released. The sound quality on this is atrocious. I repeat, do not buy this version!"
1,WHAT IS THAT HIGH PITCHED HUMMING SOUND: was it on the LP 2?,"I really like this album dispite being very dated to the 6o's flower power pop era. Songs like old man, alone again or etc. I wish that Mclean would have written more songs- I like his sensitvity over Lee's attempts at being with the times (which is why it is so dated). ""I believe in ma-ha-gic, why because it is so quick""- funny lyrics eh? The biggest problem is that there is a very high pitched fuzz sound on the CD (I don't know if it was on the original LPs)- but I find it very annoying. (the one star was just to get your attention- I give it 4 stars)"
2,A masterpiece ruined by commerce,"First thing's first: ""Forever Changes"" is a wonderful, otherworldly album that ranks with the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper"" and Hendrix's ""Are You Experienced?"" in terms of truly groundbreaking albums of the 60's. That Love is barely remembered, much less regularly worshipped, comes as something of a mystery to anyone who has heard 'em.Then Rhino comes along and puts ""Forever Changes"" through the reissue mill: turn up the bass for a supposedly fuller sound, throw on a handful of studio outtakes and less successful singles, and jack up the price by five bucks. Then take the original version of the CD completely off the market. They did the exact same thing to ""Dusty in Memphis"" last year.Do yourself a favor: go out and buy the vinyl version and hear a work of art as the artist wanted you to hear it. No album on Earth ends as well as the original version of ""Forever Changes,"" with the life-affirming trumpet lines of ""You Set the Scene"" fading out gradually."
5,Pure sensibility and full expression of psychodelism,"One of the advantages to listen songs from peace-and-love age is that beyound existence of a strong inspiration, ideas and a real feeling of freedom conquest flew free in every place were youth could be. These aspects provided a reasonable amount of original, free and unrealesed songs that were a mix of background and consequence of the psychodelic era. As like Doors, love got put in their songs all the musical sensibility of this era by a soft and particular performance of the lirics. Instruments and vocals are displaced carefully asking to listener to enjoy more and more the songs. Love features less intensive songs than Jefferson Airplane but it just provides a different (and too explendid) way to live and feel this kind of music. In Forever Changes, ""Old Man"" is a resume of Love style to perform a song with feeling and art on a real psychodelic enviroment. It's great."
5,Greatest Album Ever!!!,"What can I say? Just listen to it. Listen to the guitar break in ""A House is Not a Motel"" and get shivers down your spine. Sing along to the chorus at the end of ""The Red Telephone"", listen to those incredible horns in ""Maybe the Times..."" and then prepare for the finest closing track in history. Just those very brief highlights alone show how fantastic this music is. I ask myself all the time, why isn't this more popular? Don't other people get tingles down their spine when they hear this album? Well many people never get the chance! So, if you are considering buying this album, just do it! It is the greatest ever. I swear! The most underrated gem in all of rock. ""The news today will be the movies of tomorrow and the streets are paved with gold and if someone asks you, you can call my name!"""
5,Hypnotically beautiful,"This album was recommended to me by someone who used to be in the music scene himself. Wanting to learn more of his taste and possibly his inspirations from the past, I purchased this CD and absolutely fell in love with it. Its music is so '60's with lyrics that will haunt you even in your sleeping hours. An absolute must for every collector of music."
5,Superb trumpet!,I'll be alone again tonight has a magnificant trumpet solo that will blow your mind. Your life will not be complete if you miss this one. I'm serious.
3,Not as good as Frogstomp,"I think the first two songs on this cd are pretty heavy. Slave has some pretty good riffs and Freak starts out hard. Abuse me is an ok song. I like the phrase, throw the sailors overboard, but it is lighter. Lie to me is quick and punky. I love no association, this is my favorite song. Cemetary is light, therefore i dont like the song. The door and a pop song for us rejects are good songs. Roses and Petrol and Chlorine are good as well. I like Learn to Hate. It is one of the harder silverchair songs. I dont like nobody came, but i do like the Closing. Overall, There are a few heavy songs, and some good rock songs. But I just cant get used to the light songs. Dont get me wrong, I like Silverchair, but this cd is only so-so."
3,Get some edjimacation,"Ok, the album was pretty good. Does not compare to Frog Stomp by anymeans but what can you say ,follow ups to really great albums are tough to match or beat. I actually just dusted off my Frog Stomp cd recently, which I bought I'd say in '95. I sounds better than it did when I first heard it now that there is some history to the music. What I really wanted to say was that moron pimple faced punk with 'The Clash' and 'Sex Pistols' written in white out on the shirt he made from tearing up an old Adolecents shirt needs to learn some manners. Don't rip on music that didn't even hear before your balls dropped. Pearl Jam is amazing and I don't even have to justify that with a reason other than listen to the album without salivating to the Mest and Avril Lavine posters that line your room. Bye the way there is a forum for kids under 13 you might want to make your other posts there. Im out. Peace."
3,Cemetery is the big highlight,"This a CD grunge style with good arrangements and interpretation.I like very much Cemetery (10/10 - a slower grunge song with a strong soul). Other good and not so upbeat songs are Abuse Me (8.5/10 - atmospheric and hypnotic song), Petrol & Chlorine (7/10 - a bridge for the next Silverchair style in Neon Ballroom but no so mature yet) and Nobody Come (7/10 - Creative production, alternate slowness and harsh voice, a little bit long)Between the heavier ones I highlight Freak (7.5/10) and Door (7.5/10)The other songs is not exactly my favorite kind of music, but for people that likes pure grunge music can be OK. The almost heavy metal songs ""Lie to me"" and ""Learn to Hate"" are specially annoying for me."
3,YEAH! I'M A FREAK!,"After the great debut FROGSTOMP, Silverchair create FREAK SHOW...Both albuns are very similar...On both you can hear obvious influences from Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Nirvana... But Silverchair create their own sound, a kind of raw grunge metal with some calm moments...Anyway, FREAKSHOW travels you back to the late 90's and have classics like SLAVE, FREAK, ABUSE ME and THE DOOR!!!"
5,Can't beat Freak Show.,"I am a die hard Silverchair fan, and I have been since Frogstomp came out. But this album remains to be one of my favorites. It is very underdeveloped if you listen to their later stuff, but it has such a raw sound and you can just hear the angst in Daniel Johns voice on this album."
3,Grunge without suprises,"This is a solid rock album - Daniel Johns and the rest of group was surely young while recording it but they made a lot of good music.the only fault of it is that...it is not original.most of the songs are not suprising and usual for a grunge bands.There are too many Nirvana rip-offs (""Freak"",""Cementary,""Dead roses"") and whole album seems a bit too long.it is a great album to listen in a car or just to listen at home,everything here is solid as a rock but do not expect originality or something fresh and new.it is just good old grunge..."
2,freak show,"At this stage of their career, young Silverchair were still searching for a musical identity. The style of this album is mainly generic grunge ala - nirvana, AIC. At the same time Daniel Johns shows that he isn't just content with being Cobain Jr and briefly displays a knack for more elaborate compositions like - Cemetary and Petrol & chlorine.Despite of what 15yo mosh-pit fanatics would like you to believe, Freakshow is nowhere near a good album or an interesting one. It is merely a hint of what would come on later albums."
1,a good Seattle cover band at best,there's nothing special about Silverchair's music.in fact i wonder if Hanson had have caught on sooner would they be riding them as well? same age.this album sounds like 2nd rate Nirvana&pearl jam.i don't see what the big deal is about them.
5,One of a kind,"Meek's style has a lot in common with Chekov's--simple, brisk and always on its toes. He too has the uncanny talent for creating brutally realistic characters moreso through perfect pitch and timing rather than straight description. He has a similar absurdist humor also. Sometimes reading this, I would cry and bust out laughing at the same time.Other aspects of Meek's writing are uniquely impressive. His descriptions of setting are incredible. With a few deft words he creates visual images more exact than most writers do filling up an entire page.As well-researched and traditionally ""Russian"" as this book is, it still reads like a modern novel. Meek is concerned with action as well as characterization, adding some mystery and plot twists; and language, sex, and violence are straightforward instead of suggested.Altogether, the best of many worlds. An unusual and wonderful book."
5,Another classic dumped by the publishers,"At her best, and she is almost always at her best, Charlotte Voake is the most gifted British illustrator since Edward Ardizzone. In this divine nursery rhyme collection, she makes worlds out of the simple, suggestive words, and creates some of the most endearing illustrations of the last 50 years. While thoroughly contemporary in spirit and execution, the pictures at the same time recall the modern golden age of children's books which ran roughly from the late 1930's to the late 1950's. Candlewick Press needs a good swift kick for letting this charmer lapse from print. If a book this good isn't selling, it's the publisher's singular lack of imagination that's failed, not the artist."
5,Deida never disappoints,"While I prefer David Deida's audio lectures over his written material, I am again reminded that Deida's insight is transformative and stands alone as the best in spiritual/sexual teaching."
5,A Program That Could Solve a Lot of Problems and Enrich Many Lives,"Ken Wilber has described this as the only sex manual that you will ever need, and it is difficult to disagree with him. Though Mabel Iam's books are a fine complement to David's work.David is controversial, but then what innovator is not? He writes and teaches from the perspective of 20 years work with hatha yoga, pranayama, t'ai chi and Tantra. One of the things which I most like about his work is the constant emphasis on the dance of dualities, which has been a major focus of my own work for more than two decades. False dichotomies, such as good/bad, male/female, winner/loser, have, like other false beliefs, caused great sadness and frustration, and it is so important for people to know that there is another way.Highly recommended for adults who want to heal and enrich their lives."
4,"Not way ""advanced"" but writing style makes up for it","Of many books from this extraordinary author, this stands out as a great basic sex manual (some of his, and so many other, works seem too basic) with a flashy title (gotta bring home the bacon) and very intimate writing style that makes it hard to put down."
5,No translation necessary,"I love this album. I don't know what Kan is singing about; however, his sincerity is overwhelming. His voice leaps like a spider over the lyrics and conveys a sense of unaffected acceptance of the misery of life, without ever sliding into maudlin self-pity. The guitar is present in most songs, with the occasional visit from a flute, piano and saxophone to spice up some of the tracks. The melodies travel along a focused path with resemblances to the following: blues, jazz, accoustic punk and folk. An intriguing mixture you'll agree. That this is music of serious intent and expert execution is clear from the first listen. Now all I need is to find a translation to add another dimension to this excellent album. Highly recommended."
2,Poke Mix Too Salty for Tako Poke Recipe,"I made a pound of baby octopus and used this mix to make tako poke. It didn't turn out at all like the tako poke I've had in Honolulu with my ""local boy"" husband. I would recommend that when preparing this with tako (octopus) that you add only a little at a time and add extra flavors such as onions, tomatoes, soy sauce, rice vinegar and a bit of sugar; also the amount of sesame oil is too much for the tako. It's overpowering (maybe it's because it doesn't absorb the flavors like ahi tuna does). I'd start with maybe a quarter of the amount of sesame oil and add according to taste. This particular review is only for the tako poke, not for the ahi or tofu recipes they suggest. I'll likely try this seasoning for those, as the reviews have been favorable otherwise."
2,Not Deep Enough!,"With an awesome title like ""How Deep Is Your House?"", you would think the musician's response would be ""very deep."" Well, it isn't. This is that lightweight house from Europe. This is not the fierce stuff you'd find in Chicago or New York City. This is okay to play in the background or play at a party where dancing is not the priority. But if you want heavy bass, much beats, and soul mamas just giving there all, it is not here. This will not make you grind against a wall or a hot brotha. It will not make you move until you sweat. You won't say, ""Serve the children!"" when you hear this. It's just mediocre."
5,awesome!,"this album is awesome. ever since i heard mundy sing ""to you i bestow"" for romeo and juliet, i have been a fan, and i finally got a chance to get his debut. And I was amazed by his voice and his magnificant acoustic guitar playing. The best songs on the cd are ""Pardon Me"", ""To You I Bestow"", and ""Springstown"" for sure. Buy this cd. you will not be dissappointed."
4,Best thing from Ireland since Guinness,"Mundy absolutely blew me away when I first saw him in concert in London. In NY, despite destroying several strings on stage, his performance rocked. In concert, Life's a cinch was incredible. The album captures the magic. Also, Gin & Tonic Sky and To you I bestow are awesome. If you are looking for some great rock and roll, look no further."
3,Not too bad...,Dear Jacqui and Deep as the midnight sea have been really tough to find....All in all this is a pretty decent compilation of songs...Smooth Operator and Love is are the only 2 tracks I would have cut. I hate those two songs!
2,Not quite art,"Perhaps this book would be better titled ""Forbidden Garage Sale Finds"". The art in this collection is often second or third rate with a emphasis on mass produced decorative art (lamps, boxes etc.) Miss Naomi has produced a book that will be of interest to those who already have every other book of erotic art but if you are looking for a book of museum grade erotica you would be better served looking elsewhere (maybe ""Erotic Art: From the 17th to the 20th Century"" edited by Peter Weirmair but it might be out of print)"
2,Did not like product,"This product did not fit 2013 Rubicon Jeep Spare Tire. I also found that the cover was poorly crafted and made of very thin vinyl. Overall, the product did not meet my expectations."
5,American Flag Tire Cover,Fit well and looks great. Just right for our car. All our friends & neighbors like it also.We highly recommend it.
2,Flag wheel cover,"Does not fit my CRV wheel very well, but I love the design. I would send it back but trying to make it work"
5,Im impressed!,I am highly impressed with the quality of this item for the price. This will be much easier to put on and take off than the factory zip one I have now.
1,does not come close to fitting my 30 inch tire,"Does not fit anything over 28 inches, and to be safe, only try this if your tire is under 28 inches in diameter as the diameter of the flagged face is only 28 inches seam to seam. Don't waste your time and money if your tire is larger than 28 inches. Started tearing badly at the seam when I gently tried to stretched it over my tire. When I picked up the box containing the cover it felt empty but the cover was inside-very very light weight material, extremely thin. If your tire isn't less than 28 inches, it will tear. Even if your tire is 28 inches or smaller, Don't expect this to last repeated removal and replacement for checking your spare tire pressure. My spare tire is 265/70R16 measuring 30 inches in diameter, and this cover is so far from fitting, not even close to fitting, its just false advertising."
1,Stick with ADCO,"This is a ""one size fits all"" type item, but it doesn't fit ""all"". Says it goes up to 31"" tire size, but it doesn't. We have an SUV with tires that fit within the stated size description, but it ripped at the expansion seam while we were attempting to shoehorn it on. Also, I was disappointed with the quality of the fabric. It is a cheaper feel and thickness than ADCO covers and ripped very easily while we were struggling with it. So bag this manufacturer's products and stick with ADCO. Also, I bought it in Sept as Christmas present (I like to start early!), so now I will be screwed for getting any kind of a refund as its outside the 30 day limit."
4,good product,I bought one 5 years ago and it just now tore up. I just bought my second one. I really enjoyed my first one.
5,Superb (No Hidden Message Here),"In my ""Top 10 of All Time.""Superb, briskly written, and apparently quite close to the truth in terms of the personalities portrayed and course of events described.Sorry I can't say more...."
1,Overpriced!,"The paperback version requires initial setup, paper and ink. The Kindle version requires only setup. So which one is available for $6.00 and which one is available for the low, low price of $24.99? Not what you'd expect. I bought the paperback version for $6.00 rather than pay the ridiculous amount asked for the Kindle version. The publisher ought to be ashamed! They should take lessons from Baen books who makes ebook versions available very inexpensively."
2,Good story; weak writing,"Littell spins a good yarn, but he can't write dialogue to save his life. The inanities and cliches he puts in his characters' mouths are groan-producing and virtually destroy any sense of reality he creates with his plotting."
2,Lacks depth for its length,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was anxious to read The Company. Now having read it, I am logging on to report my dissatisfaction. For a book of this length and the time it takes from your life to read it, it does not deliver. Although it covers major events in US history since WWII, it offers only the most sketchy analysis. Character development is terrible. Save your money and your time."
5,An Insider's Guide,"Sure, there are some problems here, mostly the editor's, not Littell's. What we have, however, is a helluva fine piece of fiction that combines historical personages by name with thinly-disguised made-ups that are easily recognizable to persons familiar with the personnel of the Agency's post-war history. The portrait of James Angleton alone is frighteningly accurate. Who is the Mole in this story? If you doubt, go back (if you can find it) to John Erlichmann's similarly titled book, a roman-a-clef published 20 years ago, which disappeared from the market with remarkable suddenness. In short, Littell has written a delightful work of historical fiction, full of truth under the mask of make-up, a true page-turner of the CIA and our world since 1945."
5,Easily the best spy book I have ever read,"An amazing book, probably the most enjoyable book I've ever read and easily the best spy novel. Recommended 100 percent."
5,"Great Book, Great Story, But Count the Typos!","This book was one great read, and my only wish was that it was longer. Littell tells a good tale, although many of his characters are lacking in much personality; they're by and large props for relating the storyline. But in the end, that doesn't detract from the tale told. What is detracting---and downright embarrassing for a publishing house, I should think---is the sheer number of typos! They're everywhere! Sometimes they're just obvious little typos, but at other points they change the sense of a sentence and leave you questioning what was meant to be said. I have never read a book with so many typos. It's certainly discredit to the author of such a fine book."
4,"If you have the time, a good read","THE COMPANY is a great read about the history of the CIA, if you can make it to the end of its 896 pages. Littell's protagonist, Jack McAuliffle is the all-American boy turned spy trying to survive Berlin, Cuba, and the Middle East while trying to stay ahead of the Russian mole hidden deep in the CIA fabric. Following McAuliffle, and his mentor ""the Sorceror,"" the plotline is simple--every battle, every intelligence confrontation from the 50s through the 70s seemingly finds the Russians winning. And yet McAuliffle preserves, and in the end the Wall comes down."
2,"Too much book, too little content","Although I had read some decent reviews of this book, I found it to be way too long and very poorly written. The book manages to touch on many topics/activities/individuals over its 40 year time span, but there is little continuity and no depth to the characters, with a result that feels more like the checking off of an inventory of story ideas than a well thought out, well developed novel. The only aspect of this book that is worse than its story develpment is its editing. The copy that I received not only was missing some 30 pages, but was rife with factual, grammatical and spelling errors."
5,Intriguingly Informative,This author quite clearly has inside connections and information from the intelligence community - he almost certainly interviewed or is acquainted with people who are or were active agents in their field. One impression I am left with is the scene of the midnite assasination of a high-ranking member of the (Catholic) clergy in recent times. Anyone with memory of recent (20 yrs.)historic headlines should be able to figure out what the implication of this scenario is. Think two Popes back.
3,Good but not great,"Most of the characters are in fact caricatures. Boo hiss every time Starik enters stage left - pantomime villian, so much so it is a joke every time he appears and therefore undermines the novel's credibility. Sure, make him sinister and evil but not in such a crude way. Little nuance, irony or believibility.Some of the dialogue groans it is so clunky and cliched. Still, that being said, worth plowing through. Can't believe it is the same guy who went on to write The Stalin Epigram - a modern masterwork."
2,A long Trip Down Memory Lane to Nowhere,"I wanted to like this book. I wanted it to live up to it seeming potential. In the end this novel was a waste of time and a disappointment. This is a big book that traces the lives of a group of CIA operative from the post-War era to the present. Littel sets the story, covers the details, and gets you interested. The next thing you know Littel has spun out some amateurish and unbelieveable plot line, complete with factual mistakes and details that don't ring true. Littel is a reasonably talented writer who just can't tell a story or who doesn't really have a story to tell. To compare him to LeCarre or even Alan Furst is just plain wrong. The Company is just a waste of time. Too bad. This could have turned out to be a hell of a book in the hands of a better writer."
4,If it is Worth Doing,"This thinly veiled history of the Central Intelligence Agency - ""The Company"" to the cognoscenti - left me thinking about a maxim I had previously accepted without reservation.Using a mixture of historic and fictional characters, the author, Robert Littell, portrays an organization that is as busy fighting itself as its cold war enemy, the Soviet Union. Using the cold war backdrops of 1950s Berlin, 1956 Invasion of Hungry, the Bay of Pigs, 1980s Afghanistan and Gorbachev's overthrow, he spins a tale of Alice in Wonderland espionage, a story of people living double lives in their pursuit of a crafty, resourceful, amoral, elusive and formidable enemy.At one point early in the book, Jack McAuliffe, tells his companion that if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. This book lays the groundwork for such a premise, but even after 894 pages of justification, I am not sure I question this unconventional wisdom."
2,"Nice Detail, but Ultimately Unsatisfying","There were parts of The Company I greatly enjoyed; Littell clearly did his research when writing this sprawling epic of the Cold War, but the book's somewhat plodding pace and poorly-defined characters hurt it greatly.The book starts of on a high note - an exfiltration of a Soviet agent goes wrong and the CIA agents are forced to flee for their lives; this results in a hunt for a mole within MI6, the British Intelligence Agency. Unfortunately, it can't hold the tension as it veers off into more conventional action sequences, having characters play out parts in events such as the Hungarian Revolution and the Bay of Pigs.Many of the characters are little more than archetypes - the shoot-first action junkie, the jaded field agent, etc.Littel's eye for small details makes it an interesting book, but as a Cold War spy novel, it doesn't hold up well to many of LeCarre's work from the same period."
5,Better than expected,"A little slow in the beginning, the book really takes off.I expected it to be another spin on tom Clancy tpye gendre, but found I hate to put it down."
4,For Cold War Buffs,"While no one measures up to the underestimated Charles McCarryOld Boys, The Company kept me involved and interested for the many miles the cds accompanied me. The mix of actual fact and fiction is informative and adds to this depiction of what is the hall of mirrors of the world of espionage."
5,The ultimate spy novel,"At first, I though 1200 pages (I have the UK paperback) was a bit long. Very long. But once I got into this book, I couldn't put it down. There are dozens of characters, and the plot follows the great events of the second half of the 20th century, with a drive that is rare in spy novels. Littell is a master at creating atmosphere, and his characters stick with you like chewing gum from a hot sidewalk.I read this in just a few days, in spite of its length, staying up far too late to do so. I'm looking forward to his next book."
5,What a story!,"This is easily one of the finest spy novels I have ever read. I've never gone through a 900-page book with such interest before. It's very well written and cleverly combines real historical events and people with fictional ones. Either way, Littel paints all the characters so vividly that I can't count the number of times I checked the internet to see if one of the characters I was reading about was real or fictional. Any fan of spy fiction owes it to themselves to read this book."
3,Adequate historical espionage novel,"As a fan of Le Carre's earlier spy novels (the Cold War ones), I am always looking for something comparable. The Company is not it. It is perfectly adequate historical fiction, but does not rise to the level of art that the Le Carre novels achieve. Most of the characters are two dimensional, and the plot twists are foreseeable if you are paying attention.If you are looking for a summer spy novel to pass the time, The Company is acceptable, but it is unlikely to leave a lasting impression. Ludlum fans may enjoy it, but I doubt many Le Carre fans will."
5,Incredible,"I really really loved this book. I look forward to stealing half an hour to ready it. Intelligent, historically ground fiction."
2,Much Ado About Too Much,"First, Littell is no le Carré, and I find it ludicrous that anyone could suggest that he is. At his best (the so-called Karla trilogy), le Carré writes genuine literature; The Company isn't much more than a pot-boiler. I was particularly offended by the shamefully bad spelling ('capitol' instead of 'capital'; 'here' instead of 'hear'; 'raison' instead of 'raisin' and the constantly recurring 'breath' instead of 'breathe'). If the author can't spell, maybe he should hire an editor who can. The characters are either one-dimensional or over the top. The 'Sorcerer' is a morbid alcoholic, and I can't imagine the CIA or his friends not intervening to help him. The 'Sorcerer's Apprentice' is in the final stages of testosterone poisoning. And Leo Kritzky's final redemption on the barricades in Moscow was just cringe-inducing. Having said all that, The Company did have its moments and was an adequate time-waster while I recovered from knee surgery. What it wasn't was good."
4,"Like the CIA, Flawed But Compelling....","This book is a tour de force, perhaps the best spy novel I ever read, despite a few inaccuracies and a curious and sophomoric case of RDS (Reagan Derangement Syndrome). Also, Littell could probably have lopped off the last 100 pages or so of this door stop of a book since, for all intents and purposes, the book had ended by then. But the novel is one of the few books I've read in recent times that I truly could not put down. Littell's uncanny knowledge of tradecraft, and his byzantine plotting involving some of the key events of our time combine to make this a book well worth reading. I'll knock off a star because of the book's imperfections but it's still a heckuva good read."
4,"Good Read - Very Interesting, BUT......",I love novels about the Cold War with excellent detail about major events from different points of view. Well this book covers all of the major cold war events from The late 40's to the 90's. There is mystery - suspense - action - excellent descriptions of historical figures and events such as the Bay of Pigs - Berlin - CIA Moles. It moves along very fast. I liked the book and I haven't really liked too many lately. The author annoyed me with his description of Reagan and completely ignores his accomplishments in bringing down the Russians and ending the Cold War. He is equally hard on the Kennedy's - which I did like. Alas.. the author does have the right to his point of view. If you want to read the work of the CIA in a fun - interesting style - this is a good book. You may not admire them but you will appreciate them.
1,Discontinued: Not Windows 7 or Mac Compatible,"Many people have pointed out that several of the websites no longer work. However, the price has been vastly reduced and I was thinking it would still be worth it to purchase even if only a subset of the ""keys"" work. But I found the Mattel support site for this product and apparently it is not supported by Windows 7 or Macintosh operating systems, so I will not be purchasing it (though it may still be worth it for Windows XP system owners).Here is the support site for the product:[...]"
5,life saver,"This product was a life saver. I bought it for my 3 year old daughter, Paige, and she just cant seem to have enough of it. I work at nights so when i come home in the morning and ready for sleep, i turn the computer on and there is school for my 3 year old for several hours. The only thing is i now have to get her, her own computer as monopolize mine with this product."
2,Easy-Link Too Many Errors,"We have gotten more ""Error, please call Fisher-Price Customer Service relations at 800-432-5437..."" msgs whenever we plug in a DragonTales or Elmo. Only 2 games work with Dragon Tales and all of the rest have errors. Elmo won't even load. We have a high-end, high speed and memory computer so this is ridiculous. Very frustrating and unfair to the 3 yr old who got this for birthday and has as many restrictions as using regular website games. Poor girl. I am very displeased and calling Mattel got us no where."
5,Wonderful product...Everyone should have one!,"I love the easy link launch pad. My three and four year old would play with it on the internet all day long if I let them. They go straight to the websites and I don't have to worry about them messing anything up on my computer. My kids are learning from the activities and games they play on the websites and they are also developing great hand-eye coordination as they practice using the computer mouse.The smart keys are durable enough that I let my baby play with them in his highchair. My only complaint is that a couple of the smart keys take you to the same websites...the kids don't seem to mind because they might prefer one character over another, but I wouldn't have bought multiple smart keys that take you to the same place. And to keep the peace with my two kids...it would be great if there were a way for two kids to play some of the activities simultaneously with two separate mouses."
3,Nice internet toy for a toddler - Some keys do not work though.,"I bought this off Amazon for my son for Christmas. My son loves it, but we've just emailed Amazon because the Dog and the Dragon Tale key do not work. We also purchased the Wiggles and Barney keys. The ""mousepad"" is not the greatest ours had a big air bubble in it. It also doesn't actually connect to the station. It just sits in a hole. Overall a good $12.00 spent."
5,Brilliant Idea,"This toy is wonderful. We purchased this toy for our granddaughter who is three. She absolutely loves it. FP must have a special agreement with these websites because there are no advertisements when you plug in the characters. You are taken straight to the sight and can't use other web addresses with putting in the password you created. There is also a timer that can be utilized to stop play after a preset amount of time. The characters are a little hard to remove from the plug in but they seem to be tough and well made. I would definitely recommend this product. The extra characters can be purchased at WalMart for a bit over $5. I do not understand the huge price tags I am seeing from online companies. All that aside, I would say buy this and enjoy it with your little one!"
1,"DO NOT BUY, NO LONGER SUPPORTED!","I have this product and it hasn't worked right for over a year. I just got off the phone with their support and was told this product hasn't been supported for over a year. Most of the Key Fobs no longer work due to website changes. This could be easily fixed with an update from Fisher Price, but their official stance is they no longer support it.I'm highly disappointed and spreading the word to all I can. If you buy this toy it will not even work out of the box. Save your money for a toy that actually works, and a company that stands behind their product.Bad form Fisher-Price."
3,"Great toy, but some websites no longer work!","The Fisher-Price Easy Link toy is great! Unfortunately, it was discontinued in 2008 and most of the Smart keys are no longer connect with the websites they are supposed to. I just finished speaking with a customer service rep for Fisher-Price, and here is a list of the smart keys that DO WORK: Fisher-Price dog, Sesame Street Elmo, Clifford, Arthur, and Thomas the Train. For the smart keys the DO NOT WORK: Dragon Tales, Bob the Builder, Disney Princess, Higglytown Heroes, Mickey Mouse, JoJo's Circus, Little Einsteins, Cars, Handy Manny, Barney,and the Wiggles. I really hope this helps because I would have been upset if I would have purchased them, only to get them and the sites not work."
1,Wish it wasn't dicontinued,"I recently purchased this at a kids resale. It came with the Elmo, Dragontales, & Spotted dog links. The only link that still works is the spotted dog:( My 3yr old loves it also. I called customer service and they said the others are no longer supported & there's nothing they can do about it. Elmo is from Disney/Sesame Street & Dragon Tales is from PBS. These companies had a contract with Fisher price when the toy first came out that they no longer validate anymore. All the links from Fisher price still work (spotted dog & Clifford I believe.) Like I said I purchased it at a resale & only paid $2 so its still worth it since the one link works. I wouldn't waste anymore money on it though. You could just go directly to the Fisher price website and play these games for free but it is nice to know that my 3 yr old can't open any of my files if she accidentally clicked on something when she is on the easy link. Hope this helps."
3,a few kinks but worth it,"this is definetly a must have for any parent with a toddler. it's easy to install and easy to operate. just a few qualms tho. it's not mac compatible as of yet. you need to make sure you have the latest version of flash and shockwave installed. the pattern on the mouse pad messes around with optical.( i just use a regular mouse pad). now if you are tech save you can just go to the actual kids' websites but this is a definite must have if you don't want your kids accidentally deliting files on your desktop. the 5-30 dollars per key set is worth the trouble of entertaining and educating, and especially distracting your toddler without destroying ur computer."
5,best money i've spent in a long time!,"I can't recommend this high enough! I've receommended it to all my friends with small children. I've been hesitant to let me 2 1/2 year old onto the computer because he would ""click"" everything and go into files that he shouldn't. All that has been eliminated and he played on it for 3 1/2 hrs the first time!!!"
3,"ok, would not recommend it, but enjoyed the reviews","First, I wish I would have read all these reviews prior to buying this toy. I bought it for my 3 year old. I did find it odd not able to download the software that came on the cd. I feel the firewall was my biggest problem with installation. I loaded it on my 10 year olds lap top, so they could play it together. There were some problems loading and very poorly written instructions, but after a second attempt and disabling security, it was a sucess. Until the next day, my daughter was working on a reading project in word and received the horrific windows blue screen fatal error that said to uninstall any recently installed programs. She lost some of her work. I uninstalled the program and it's been a week with no further problems. I will attempt to install it again on our family desktop but I have my concerns. Overall, my money would have been better spent buying her a couple more vsmile TV plug in play games that my 3 year old prefers anyway."
3,Is it worth it?,"The only thing this toy really does is prevent your little one from accidentally wandering off to any other websites. Beside that, you can go to these website for free, and it is a nuisance to have to remove the gadget from the computer when they're done playing."
4,Nice toy...,My 3 year old calls this his internet...It's perfect because it is the only thing he can play with on the computer and he can't mess with any of my programs. We gave him his own account on our computer and it makes him feel special.
1,Like others - this did not meet expectations,"As previous reviewer has mentioned, this could have been a great toy but unfortunately - it does not come any close.Normally my 4 years son can play games on internet which are meant for his age-group, but he struggled with the games listed here. He quoted that ""these games are for older kids"". We have not explored much but controls are lousy and slow.Now a great buy!!!"
4,Great toy,I really like this toy and my daughter does too. She is 2 1/2 yr old. My problem is the buttons that you have to push. My daughter doesn't like waiting for the items to pop up on the screen. She is constantly throwing the pieces around. So it is probably better for an older child.
2,"A sinister plot, worthy of Dr. Evil","The book starts out well enough when banker Ben Hartman, in Switzerland on business, runs into an old college buddy who tries to kill him. Then through a series of accidental discoveries, narrow escapes, and unbelievable coincidences, Hartman learns that practically everybody he knows, and everyone new he meets, is involved in an evil cabal bent on world domination.When you finally find out who the criminal mastermind is, it seems like something only Austin Powers' nemesis Dr. Evil could have pulled off. Without giving too much away - I have to say that the ending involves the hero attempting a daring rescue from the villain's heavily-guarded, secret mountain lair. And of course there is a scene where the villain feels the need to carry on a long monologue to explain his evil plot to the hero. Yeah baby, yeah!"
5,The last Ludlum (?),"I've been a fan of Robert Ludlum's ever since the original publication of ""The Scarlatti Inheritance"", many years ago. Sure, I know that his plots are often preposterous, the characters wooden, and the dialogue often quite stilted, but I really don't care! The man told a terrific story, one that kept me interested from beginning to end. Along the way I was given a glimpse of many interesting places in Europe (especially) and around the globe. The books were entertaining, and that's all I really ask from this genre. I either heard of read that there many be a few more Ludlum-completed works around, for publication in later years. That's some consolation to such a faithful reader as myself. If, and when, they are published, I'll read them."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another novel where the plot has roots in World War Two.A man's friend tries to kill him, and he finds a brother that he thought was dead. To top that off, add in an international financial conspiracy.At the same time, a government agent is investigating the deaths of men of money and power, but when she finds out too much, orders are given to get rid of her.Naturally, the twain meet and work as allies to uncover what is going on with the Sigma operation.The secret is truly bizarre, and explains it all."
2,Not his best work,"I'm a big Robert Ludlum fan however, the Sigma Protocol hardly compares to any of his previous works. Too much random hodge podge and not enough meaning to the story. Weak dialogue and too many irrelevant characters."
1,No More Ludlum Books!,He just needed a payday to put his name on this garbage. Did anyone at St Martin's Press read this before they fired up the presses? I doubt it. A must miss!
2,One of the few Ludlum novels I did not finish,"I made it to a little past 400 pages and my increasing lack of interest finally got to me.The main characters get less sympathetic. The turns in the plot become more gratuitous. The narrow escapes from death become more far-fetched. Little mistakes in the writing become more annoying. The idea of a secret organization pulling the strings on the major events of the world gets more silly in the 21st century.Nevertheless, I will miss further writings by the author. I wish the publishers had paid him more respect by noting his passing in the book's flyjacket rather that referring to him as a living author."
1,The Wild West moves to Switzerland,"Robert Ludlum transforms ""Verhuete Laerm!"" idyllic Switzerland into a wild west shoot-out backdrop where bullets buzz around the peaceful citizens in the streets of Zurich. Yes, the plot moves at a breakneck pace and overdone brutality is the author's key ingredient. With political correctness, the old ... who are suckling the secret of eternal youth must meet their overdue demise. Go ahead and read it and don't say I didn't warn you! Gerborg"
4,Fitting Closeout to a Wonderful Career,"Many of the other reviewers are right. This is Ludlum's best book in years, but I can't place it on par with the best in recent fiction. I have been a Ludlum fan since day one. And perhaps like you, I was disappointed in his later efforts, but few were as adept at weaving a story. That is taking a thread here, a thread here, a thread here and building a tapestry. Unfortunately THE SIGMA PROTOCOL turned out to be less of a tapestry and more of an afghan (no pun here). You feel the tugging of a great concept, but are led from the prospect of an enormous, implausible worldwide conspiracy to an implausible conculsion. Many questions are left unanswered. Along with Stephen King's BLACK HOUSE, this is the second book in as many months which has used the theme of world-wide missing children to bolster the story. Both results belong closer to the science fiction aisle than the horror or mystery section. In the end, a good read. Buy the paperback for a rainy weekend."
1,Dissapointed,"I tried my best to enjoy Ludlum's Sigma Protocol, but towards the end I found myself struggling to finish the book.First of all there are WAY TOO MANY INSIGNIFICANT CHARACTERS. From the first moment a new character is introduced, to the next time you read about that character again, you forget his/her significance because so many other characters are thrown in between. I had a very hard time trying to remember who's who and their role in the story.Furthermore, I didn't sense any chemistry between Ben Hartman and Ana Navarro. I could only believe they were growing close because the story calls for you to logically believe so. After awhile, I honestly didn't care about their mission.Word to the wise, if you're going to tackle this book, have a notepad handy to take notes. You'll find yourself referring back to your notes from time to time as you read on."
3,A Shadow of Ludlum,"Robert Ludlum has written some great books (which I have re-read numerous times) - and this is not one of them.While the plot is reminiscent of some of his masterpieces, the depth and accuracy is not there. This book was not finished (as we know) by the author. Perhaps that explains why some flagrant errors were not caught. For example, in one of the first scenes in the book someone's throat is cut via the femoral vein, come on! the femoral is in the groin/leg - what was meant was the carotid.Nevertheless, this book is a pleasant read, especially in honor of a great author - just don't expect too much."
4,A nice finish,"The literature world lost a great member when Robert Ludlum passed away. Though he wrote what many people called formula novels, he brought a flair to the genre with his excellent research and well-contrived plots.The Sigma Protocol continues his tradition, though there were several times I felt the writing was inconsistent, thus suggesting maybe someone finished this for him. Evend desptite this, I found this novel instantly enjoyable and something all fans of the genre will enjoy.Other suggestions:Code to Zero, by Robert LudlumSoft Case, by John Misak"
5,Incredible,"This book kept me glued to the pages from beginning to end. Very well written. I've read many Ludlum books, and this one is one of my favorites. Right up there with the Bourne series"
3,The Sigma Protocol,Ok for Ludlum. This book was not a match for the Bourne Series. But an ok read nonetheless. A bit disconnected in some parts
2,"Don't start, you'll be mad at yourself","I started this one based on the enjoyment I got from the Bourne books. Don't. The plot is silly, the characters weak, the resolution absurd. Pseudo spys with pseudo science and still dumb luck determines the outcome. Wished I hadn't wasted my time."
3,"Long, Somewhat Generic, Coulda Been Better","This books comes off too long & too average compared to a few other Ludlum books I've read. The characters never seemed to develop very much, especially because they were always on the run & just busy with little dialogue or reflection in my opinion.The premise was intriguing & conspiracy was secretive & elusive. But it seemed to me that everyone mentioned in the book either was a part of the ""Corporation"" or was going to get killed very shortly without revealing all that much. It seemed to take a long time to learn more & more about this ultra-secret ""Corporation"" that I was losing interest & wishing for the end of the book instead of churning through more pages."
2,Probably not Ludlum's best...,"I wouldn't recommend the Sigma Protocol unless you have already read (and enjoyed) some of Ludlum's other works. The ""Sigma Protocol"" seems to get gradually more predictable and tedius the more you read. I was particularly disappointed with the ending."
1,"5 stars, really?","This book is so implausible and in-conherent, that I find it shocking that there are this many people giving it a 5 star. Although pieces of the book can be brilliant and vivid at times, overall it is the type of story that has a grand and larger than life scheme but never has the substance to back it up. Your money would be better spent on ice cream."
1,"Come on guys, even if I was cheerleading","I couldn't have given this book more than one star. The plot is so-so, the characters semi-believable, but the writing is just downright bad. Which is pretty consistent with his other work, come to think of it.How bad is bad? How about ""Ben slipped his right hand under his left jacket lapel, reached for the cold hard steel of the gun and was afraid."" Huh? Or ""He couldn't put it past Agent Navarro to have had some male colleague call the hotel to get his messages, see whom he was in touch with."" Huh? I feel the room around me spinning...Cover of the books says ""Perfectly executed...Thunders forward at breakneck pace."" - People. That it ain't. Looks like the pro reviewers are no different than stock analysts. Jack Grubman, you've got company, man. Lots of company."
5,Great suspense and what good books should be - Sigma Protocol,"This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. The suspense starts in the first chapter and doesn't let down till the very last chapter. Many twists and turns, you never know whats going to happen next (In a good way). I love the way Ben and Anna come together to conquer and understand Sigma. Wow, I loved this book and it is a re-read potential."
3,"A small step down from the Bourne, otherwise great.","Although I enjoy Mr. Ludlum's works, I had to give Sigma 3 stars as I think the conspiracy could have been strengthened still. The core plot is plausible if supported further. But in itself, this is a great book and still bears the Ludlum signature - its still fast-paced, heart-pounding with a globe-trotting hero etc. If this was the work of any other author, the praise would be well deserved but Sigma from one that authored the Bournes, leaves me just a bit disappointed."
2,"Formulaic, Poorly Written, Overly Long","I was disappointed in this novel. The writing was clumsy and forced, and this proved to be distracting in many instances. The book was full of poorly researched technical info (Versed is an opioid??), mock-heroic and comic-book villain dialogue, and seemingly endless contrivances designed to stretch the plot out to over 600 pages. It did not approach the quality of the Bourne novels. There was some fairly interesting dialogue and information about the moral conundrums faced by both Germans and Jews during the holocaust, and at times I really liked agent Navarro. But these good points were overwhelmed by the overall silliness of one yawner of an action sequence after another. I became so tired of this that I skimmed the last 100 pages, unable to focus any longer during a time that should have been the most riveting."
3,"Starts Out Slow, Speeds Up, and Ends Ubruptly","I had never read a Ludlum book before, but after seeing ""The Bourne Identity"", I thought I'd give him a try.It took me some time to get into the book. I think I started it two or three times and would love the first chapter and then get bored after about 30 pages into it and put it down. By the time I picked it up again, I had to start over.After finally getting into it, I really started to love it. I couldn't put it down. It was a super page turner, lots of action and not too much boring detail.By the end, it just ended so ubruptly, it made me wonder why all of the characters in the book were introduced when very few of them were significant enough to remember by the end.Read with a notepad to keep track of the characters and their purpose + other important facts that return to the plot 400 pages after being introduced.Good read all together. I can see how maybe his earlier books would be better though. 3 Stars ***"
2,Dissapointing,"I was disapointed at Mabele for this one. The CD is incosistent and you get the feeling that he was trying to fill the Cd, shown by the instrumental piece which is also not of the super guitar soukouss that Mabele and Loketo are known for. A lot of skipped tracks on this one."
3,Visually beautiful and thought provoking,"It appears that this woman has one life as a high-powered exec in New York and another completely different existence as a homemaker and mother in a French countryside of jaw-dropping beauty. (If her French life ever becomes available, I want it!) The appeal of this film is the insight that chosing one thing prevents others that may be equally marvelous. Worth seeing once. The little girls, especially the five-year-old, were adorable."
3,Surprisingly engrossing,"There've been a lot of Demi Moore pictures which have done nothing for me. Eg, Ghost. But this one just stays with me. Partly because she has not one but two excellent, hot leading men (yes, I'd say it's a girl flick). Partly because she really does have that ""star"" quality, the energy that pops off the screen, the haunting, slightly hoarse voice. Ok, the writing is a tad uneven, but I'm able to take the occasional awkward line in stride in favor of the compelling performances, including actors Stellan Skarsgrd and William Fichtner. (I do think the title of the film stinks: oh, well.) The production design is topnotch and Demi has some excellent costumes. Ladies, add this to your collection."
2,Passion of Mind,"Good Lord Demi Moore goes artie. This would have been an interesting movie if the premise had not been done SOOO many times (I actually liked Sliding Doors, maybe it was the company). Ms. Moore is hopelessly out of her depth as an actress portraying a women with serious issues, and her attempts at introspection are seriously laughable (hopefully that is not an oxymoron). In any case, during this movie, I honestly chuckled at some of the dialogue, and it really was only saved from a ""1"" by the supporting actors. Demi, as usual, was truly brutal."
4,Great!,"For those who enjoy the psychology of the mind, this portrayal of a split personality is quite good. As a future therapist, I found it fascinating seeing what life could be like for someone with MPS. I can see, however, that the movie could be confusing or ""dumb"" if seen by those without extensive psychological background."
3,Piano and Chords but no Tab!,"Its great to have JT music at all, and I agree with the earlier reviewer that its definitely worth having. However, he appears to be saying that ""The guitar TAB is useful"", and I purchased this book from the UK site on that basis. Imagine my chagrin when I find that it is piano and chords only, but no TAB.So, generally useful, but nothing like as useful as guitar tablature would be."
4,As Promised,"The item was in better condition than I hoped for, however it wasn't clarified that the CD came in a blank CD case instead of the original. Overall, it was delivered quickly and in great condition, so no real complaints!"
4,very nice recording of nice songs,"Top notch audio quality on this studio album. Very enjoyable. Typical JT, very pleasant but nothing out of the ordinary in terms of song writing at first listen."
2,Too mellow after all these years,"Whether singing about Nixon's departure from The White House (""Line `Em Up"") or man's destruction of the planet (""Gaia"") James Taylor keeps his cool, and that's the problem. One song blends effortlessly into the next until they lose their individuality and the listener is lulled softly into a trance. Lyrically interesting but musically lacking in adventure; Taylor's music has mellowed with age. This is not always a good thing."
5,A must for any real or imaginary JT fan. Worth every penny.,"A friend has this cd, and I listened to it about 4 times and then ordered it myself. I found myself humming or singing the lyrics to several of the songs at work and home. Line em Up, Gaia, in fact the first 6 songs are all killer tracks. With Sting, Shawn Colvin, and others backing on vocals and the very tight playing guest musicians, this is by far the best light sounds cd I've had the pleasure enjoying since the last Dan Fogelberg/Tim Weisberg collaberation, and it is far and away better than that one! JT, my hat is off to ya!"
5,One of the Best!,One of the bst CD's of all times. James Taylor has always been a favorite of mine. This one will go down in the record books. As a matter of fact it already has; winning the album of the year. Keep up the good job James!
1,Warning,"Putting a Sony Enhanced (copy-protected) CD in your computer may install a rootkit on your system, leaving it extremely vulnerable for hackers.Buy the music online. If you have an MP3 player, and want to play it on a Windows computer, beware."
2,not useful,"I live in Japan and I am here to tell you that these proverbs are rarer than an uncooked steak. 80% of the proverbs my Japanese friends have never heard of, and the rest they are not sure what the proverbs actual mean. My advice is master the easier Japanese first!"
1,Disappointed,"I am an avid follower of chinese horoscopes and found Lori Reid's book to be very disappointing. Not much depth to her work at all! Saying it is concise is being kind. For the serious reader, I'd recommend the Handbook of Chinese Horoscopes by Theodora Lau."
5,Fabulous thorough book of chinese horoscopes - great gift,This book is well written for those of us having fun with horoscopes. It is conscise and easy to read. Great gift.
3,Chinese Horoscopes,The book itself is well written and explanatory. How ever I would have liked it to have gone further back in years. It starts in1975. Most of the people i come in contact with were born a number of years earlier.
3,Nice shells but some were broken,"The shells were pretty and I liked the net bag, but some shells were broken. The shells range from small to medium, so if you're looking for large shells, you're better off getting something else.I bought these to get an assortment of shells for my hermit crabs to move into, and of the 3 medium shells that looked suitable, only two were usable. It's unfortunate because the one that was broken was the perfect size and shape for my crabs. I also found pieces of shell in the bag, so they will only be useful as decoration. There were many half clam shells that can be useful as mini-food dishes for treats."
1,Be advised of quantity you get,I was fairly surprised (disappointed) at the size of the net bag (translated to quantity of shells). It's hard to tell from pictures so I advise all who consider buying it that the net bag these come in fits into a regular coffee cup. I know you can buy 10 times the amount for the same money if you live in Florida -- just something to consider....
2,"Go to retail store, better prices.","Very disappointed in my shells, saw a similar bag at Ben Franklin Crafts for $1.99, I needed them quickly and was unable to travel to the craft store, so purchased on-line, I will not be doing that again. I could have recived 3 1/2 times the quantity for the same price."
4,"good product, arrived on time - review shipping fees",good quality and arrived on time using ups (a plus as compared to usps) I would recomend it to anyone. However I think seller should review their shipping prices. I had originally planned to include in the order 4 string for the violing but they increased the shipping by $16 !!!!. To my surprise with my order I received a thick catalog that weighted probably four times (5 times maybe?) the combined weight of the four strings I had originally planned to order. What a way to loose a sale!
3,Seems Obscure,"I feel almost guilty writing this because I truly love Thomas Merton and own many of his books,but,I find much of his poetry obscure and difficult to understand. I wish there was something available,a type of guide that would aid in understanding his poems."
3,"Jar bent, contains soy.","While it could be a great shortening, it is frustrating, that the ingredients were not properly listed by Amazon. This product contains soy. As far as the packaging - is was poorly packed and the jar came badly bent."
2,"Great film, bad soundtrack","The soundtrack album for JERRY MAGUIRE is deeply flawed.The first five songs have one thing in common: shaky vocals that border on annoying. Most of the others are simply mediocre. The best here, Springsteen's ""Secret Garden,"" McCartney's ""Momma Miss America"" and Dylan's ""Shelter From The Storm"" are just not enough to save or make owning this one worthwhile.A backward pass for a loss of yardage. (2 stars)"
3,question!!! please help!,i was also wondering about the name of the song that is played when tom and renee are on the porch together after their date...does anybody know?? please help me!
2,I would buy the movie instead,A bunch of songs that no one has heard of or tunes that you just don't want to hear again. The only reason I gave it the two stars is because the movie was so wonderful.
5,About Mexican Song,"The Mariachi song in the restaurant were Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger did the dinning scene wasn't Armando Manzanero's ""Por Debajo de la Mesa""... it was Gloria Estefan's ""No me vuelvo a enamorar"""
3,About the Mexican Song,"I've been trying to find the exact song sung in this movie but I can't. The original version was written by Armando Manzanero and it's name is ""Por debajo de la mesa"". This one is a very popular song sung by many artists in Latin America, but the best performance by far is by Luis Miguel. Too bad that this CD is missing a few of the melodies heard in the film."
3,Question,What is the name of the instrumental that is played when Tom Cruise and Renee Zelweger are standing on her front porching kissing? Is it even on the soundtrack?
3,Good sountrack for great movie,"I have seen ""Jerry Maguire"" many times over the last few years, and I can't get tired of Renee Zellweger's wonderful, hypnotic performance. The soundtrack is good, but is not up to the level of the film. My favorite tracks are Pocketful of Rainbows (love Elvis banter with the engineer before the music starts), Secret Garden and Shelter from the Storm (great use in the final scene)."
2,Missing Songs,"In response to the question, ""I am looking for the name of the song ... played during the scence when cuba gooding is talking to jerry maguire on the phone right before his famous line of ""show me the money""?"" the answer is ""The Wrong Come Up"" by LV.I gave this CD two stars because it is missing lots of good songs from the movie (like the one mentioned above)."
4,Love it,"This is a cool soundtrack, great driving music. Jerry Maguire is one of my all-time favorite movies, so each song evokes the memory of a scene. But even though the music here is great, it is missing Jerry's ""turning point"" tune, ""Free Fallin'"" which would have made the album complete, so I have to knock off one star for that.Question: Can anyone tell me which scene in the movie that Aimee Mann song is played?? Because I've watched it more times than I can tell you and I've never heard it in the movie!!"
4,good selection of songs for the movie,this particular selection of songs added to the film- watch the film without the help of these songs and the film is not as powerful-the songs may be old and not anything people are generally used to-yet it helps the film and I enjoyed the diversion
4,The music makes the movie great.,"I loved the music so much. I want the original score. If you know where I can get it please let me know. I was a little upset to see there wasn't one song on there. The song right before the infamous ""You complete me."" scene. That song was beautiful. Buy the CD though its good."
3,Note for ASH,"Hey ! I am also looking for the song free falling ! Had you had any luck yet ?If anyone can help, please mail me: mark_waring@yahoo.comThanks ! Mark."
2,"Selection is good, quality is very bad!","The recording and mastering of this album is so bad that I get an headache if I listen to it with an headphone. I would recommended Vol. 2 though, everything is perfect in that album."
3,mtv unplugged,It actually was better then I thought it was gonna be. I didn't realize it was a DVD when I ordered it. But thank-you. I think my 15 yr old enjoys it more then me.
1,disappointing,"Granted, there are some good songs on there, but nothing can compare to the unplugged sessions that were done by Nirvana and Alice In Chains, those two are undoubtedly the two best. If you want some amazing unplugged work, invest in those two instead, I gauruntee that you will not be disappointed."
1,Total crap,Seriously? No Nirvana? Nirvana's Unplugged remains one of the band's most polarizing moments. This album has a low rating for a reason.
1,No Nirvana or Alice in Chains,I do not own this album; I do not intend to. The reason being is because neither performances by Nirvana or Alice in Chains are featured in this album. You're better off buying Nirvana's MTV Unplugged Live in New York DVD or CD. Enough said.
3,no nirvana,"i dont know for sure, but i would be willing to guess that the rights to the music have something to do with it. ie courtney love."
1,Never Received It,"I never received this item and when I go to ""My Account"" it is impossible to find out whAT HAPPENED. NEXT QUESTION: AM I HAPPY?"
3,Not the best book in my collection,"I got a copy of this book a couple of weeks ago, and had high hopes for it. Sadly, there are some mistakes in the book, and I was not that impressed with the quality of the photos. The Penske 917/10 raced in L&M; colors, not Sunoco, and the McLaren M17 Offy was not a twin turbo. The chapter on the filming of LeMans was interesting, but again, not much new. The last few chapters on newer cars in Gulf livery were a bit more interesting, since less has been written about them. For much better books on John Wyer and Gulf, look to eitherRacing in the Rain: My Years with Brilliant Drivers, Legendary Sports Cars, and a Dedicated Team, by John Horsman, orThe Certain Sound: Thirty Years of Motor Racing, by John Wyer himself."
4,So Much for Them,"The only bad thing about it is it's not 'Forever Changes.' That said, it's hard putting it down (or giving it back to your friend) and hard not listening to the shouts for the songs at Love concerts. 'August,' 'Your Friend and Mine,' 'Singing Cowboy,' and 'Always See Your Face' are up there with anything they've done, though the sound's changed - more fuzz, less orchestra, less Byrds (since I hear them mentioned all the time). Love purists will suffer the loss, but so much for them."
4,great for kids,My 4 yr old daughter sings some of the songs on this CD at pre-school. I got it so she can sing along in yhe car. She loves it!!!.
3,should let us know not all in english.,my grandchildren like it and over all so do I.. But it should tell you before you buy it that not all the songs are in english I would have perfered all english. but that is the only thing I didnt like. I bought it for my car when I have grandkids with me. and they seem to enjoy it.
5,Charlotte Diamond,"Of all Charlotte Diamond CDs that I have, this is the favorite. Every song is a winner. HIghly recommend."
5,Attention Honda Accord 2000 with ULEV engine.,"This sensor will fix the error code P1166, P1167...Do not buy from CAP, AutoZone, etc...those generic sensor won't fix the code P1166, P1167...I learn my lesson with CAP, they sold me the generic sensor and won't take it back unless I buy the one makes for ULEV engine ( which is California emission model ) that cost $170.00. I ended up buying this one from StockWiseAuto and ate the generic one from CAP."
3,Minor Contribution to the Literature,"The five essays in this short book dip into various aspects of post-World War II international criminal law. Although clearly written, the essays are only loosely linked, and it's hard to imagine what their audience was intended to be. Lawyers will be put off by the lack of a comprehensive legal overview of the new International Criminal Court; historians and political scientists will be disappointed by the short shrift given to the Yugoslavia and Rwanda war crimes tribunals; and the general reader probably won't have enough background to appreciate the occasional esoteric legal point. Frankly, almost any reader -- professional or layman -- would be better off with William Schabas' An Introduction to the International Criminal Court, which gives a lucid overview of the law and fills in the historical details."
5,wicked!!!,so if your feeling alittle manic this is the album to listin to.. excellent lyrics and music....go crazy!!!
2,Mediocre Band and Album,"I thought I'd buy this to add to my collection of ""influential but overlooked bands from the 1980's"". I was hoping for something at least as half as good as the Pixies, but received far less. The singing is annoying, the playing mediocre and the songs uninspired. While hard-core fans may think this album is fantastic, to someone like me who has varied tastes in music but never heard the Throwing Muses before, it's a big disappointment."
5,"A guilty pleasure, but a pleasure all the same","OK, it's a bit cheesy - it's Lifetime, for God's sake. But I just love this film, about a woman who may or may not be the jilted ex-lover of a prominent (and married) surgeon, who denies having had any relationship with her. Every time I watch it, I see some little insight into the character of the obsessed woman Ellena Roberts (played well enough by Jenna Elfman, though personally I would have liked to see Mira Sorvino).The more I see it, the more well-written I realize it was.And it's a treat to see Dr. Cuddy from ""House"" in the film.I don't know. I just love this movie!"
4,Beyond Obsessed!,"I saw this movie on lifetime and after the movie ended I was stunned. The woman in the movie obviously needed psychiatric help, and I was wondering why no one discovered this before she made the doctor and his family's life a living hell. Jenna Elfman did a decent job as the psychotic woman who had no boundaries as for how she behaved in court and towards the doctor and his wife. It will make you wonder after seeing this film if sometimes when men are accused of having affairs and say they did not do it, the movie will make you think that perhaps they may be telling the truth."
2,"Not one of the best, like the last reviewer said...","I like almost all of Lifetime's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best. The name bring ""obsessed"" was not what it should have been called, the lady was dreaming and had an illness. This movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through, this movie was not what I had expected. As I said I like almost all of Lifetime Original Movies but I definitely wan't be watching this one again."
1,Read Reviews VERY Carefully,"I saw this movie on Lifetime and thoroughly enjoyed it--especially the twist. This is a great movie, but if you haven't seen it yet, and you really want to enjoy it, I suggest that you NOT read any of the reviews fully, or the ending will surely be given away.I have to now update my review about receiving this movie from the seller. I waited several months before opening this movie (I had previously seen it on Lifetiime, hence, my review above). When I finally opened the movie, it was the wrong Movie!!! I attempted to contact the seller (MOVIE AND GAME STORE), but they did not answer my email."
5,Concise and covers many points in starting up a business,"I am at the point to run the first round of non-founder funding for my 5-year-old start-up when I grabbed this book off the bookstore's shelf. The author clearly understood the process of building a business, and knows how to get outside investors interested in a start-up. One interesting viewpoint the author held was that VCs are the most expensive financial aid a start-up can find, and offered alternatives to getting VC's funding. In the end the author addresses ways an entrepreneur can be really paid off for the efforts invested, both by way of IPO and by non-IPO means. In general, I find this book very helpful to help one understand many faces of starting up."
3,Space Chimps,"Ham III is the grandson of Ham, the first-ever chimp astronaut. This ne'er-do-well chimp may not be the most qualified ape for the job, but a scheming senator has recruited him for a most dangerous mission. It seems that a powerful tyrant has overtaken an alien world, and now it's up to Ham III and his trusty simian crew to help overthrow the deep-space despot. There's nothing complicated about ""Space Chimps"". It's a simple tale of 3 chimps sent to outer space and somehow end up on a strange and unmanned planet. Your kids will like this movie, but it's quite boring for the grown ups."
4,Love the Chimps,"What an adorable, funny and entertaining movie. Everyone from my 6 year old to my 13 year old loved it. I know the critics weren't crazy about it, but our family thought it was a hit."

3,Chimps in space...,This was a good release to watch. I enjoyed it all the way through.I actually would like to of given this 3.5 stars instead of just 3. Both adults and children of all ages will enjoy this. The CGI was pretty good and the story line was also good. It's a for sure to-rent movie and I also think it's a good movie to-buy if you so choose to do.
2,Poor,"I had the misfortune of watching about half of this movie over Christmas. While I love animated films, (I own all the Pixar films) and usually like animated kids movies, I did not enjoy this one. The storyline was alright, but the animated characters just didn't have the right 'feel' to them. The main character, HAM-III, was too cocky and sure of himself to be likable. The voice acting is also a downgrade from the other animated films released in 2008. The movie just felt sub-par when compared to other kids flicks I've seen that last few years. Also, the animation itself is of a lesser quality; it just doesn't look polished.If you're looking for a good animated film for your kids, check out WALL-E (or anything Pixar) or KUNG FU PANDA. They are much better films and more watchable for an adult audience. (KUNG FU PANDA made me laugh my pants off; Jack Black's voice acting is hysterical)."
1,A masterful restoration!,"For those who think that all of Renoir's nitrate negatives were lost in that air raid Paris in '42, I've got joyous news: the folks at Criterion Collection have unexpectedly unearthed this! Apparently one of the prints was misshelved somewhere deep in the basement of the Soviet Gosfilmofond film archive in Moscow. It has now been lovingly restored to its original brilliance by those geniuses at the UCLA Film and Television archive.""Space Chimps"" comes, mind you, from about 1937, the time just before ""La Grade Illusion (specifically, between ""La Vie Est a Nous"" and ""La Marseillaise,"" before Renoir's voice had really matured.)So if you're a film buff who's willing to overlook a few clunky moments and some needless exposition, what a treasure waits in store for you!"
4,Can't go wrong with talking monkeys,"My kids love this movie. If you're looking for some good family entertainment, I recommend Space Chimps."
4,child appropriate film,"Fun for young and old. Imagination and animation come together and journey to another planet. Bold vivid colors, humor and action meet and deliver good clean fun."
1,Not as described,DVD has no picture on DVD and will not play in DVD Recorder. Nothing mentioned in relation to Region etc when advertised. Too much of a hassle to have to pay postage etc to return it.
1,Defective Product and Terrible Farberware Customer Service,"Less than a week after receiving the pot, the bottom started to come apart. Little circles of aluminum were visible at the center of discolored splotches where the allegedly stainless coating was inadequate. And this without any abuse (or even going into the dishwasher). Just awful.The experience got worse trying to take advantage of the ""limited lifetime warranty"" from Farberware. Their 800 number is just a recording that promises you necessary information and then starts over from the top without providing any actual information. In other words, it's an endless loop promising you details on how to seek service but then looping again. Before it starts over, it suggests you try their website . . . which also has no actual information about warranties or how to get service. A complete, abismal run around.I'm sending it back to Amazon and letting them deal with this turkey. But in general, a very unhappy experience."
5,Great steamer!,"I bought this pot to use for pasta, but soon discovered that it's the perfect size for steaming clams. The pot is deep and the steamer sits on top giving you plenty of room for liquids underneath. Previous steamers I have owned always have the steamer compartment sitting so close to the bottom of the pot you end up boiling the stuff in the bottom of the basket. The pot is nice and thick and cooks evenly. I frequently use it when making sauce and soups. During the summer I would normally use my big outdoor pot for doing clams, but this pot is the perfect size for two dozen or so (littlnecks). In the time it takes to eat the first batch, the second are already done. It's a manageable size for cleaning and stores nicely with my other pots."
3,Lifetime Warranty... I don't think so!,"I ordered two of the Farberware stockpots, one for me, the other for my son. I opened the first one and was displeased with the way the ""snug"" fitting lid fit the insert. I promptly called Farberware. I didn't have any trouble getting through to a live person, however, I was cut off after being put on hold for an extended period of time. When I called back, I was transferred to the person I was originally talking to. It was then that I was courteously informed that I would have to return my purchase to Amazon because they didn't have any inserts to replace the defective one. Fortunately, Amazon handled the return extremely efficiently, but how can one get satisfaction from Farberware for the guarantee against defects when the part isn't even available? Now, in Farberware's defense, the second pot was just fine."
5,The ending says it all,"Aside from a few overlong musical interludes (although the Beethoven segement, the Star Spangled Banner, and the final tune is wonderful), this is a wonderful movie that will stay in your mind forever if seen in childhood and that you will truly enjoy as an adult.The final scene with Linus, CB, and Lucy (along with Rod McKuen singing the title cut) says it all in this film. Don't know what I'm talking about? See it and you will."
