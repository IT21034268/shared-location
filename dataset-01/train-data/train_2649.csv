4,Superb Mediaeval Mystery,Another superb mystery from Ellis Peters. I hope my local library gets more of these as I would love to read more
4,Soothing Background Music for Study,"Bought this album probably 12 years ago, back when mp3.com was a site for indie music producers. It's been on my playlist for soothing instrumental/background music since then. I play this when reading the Bible, other inspirational books, or even when writing software (what I do for a living)."
5,love songs,Fantastic love the music all original keep up the good work this is added to my 49 other dusty albums.
2,Very Disappointed,"Although the Pierre Cardin Gold Tone Pocket Watch was sent swiftly, the casing was obviously damaged and used when I had spent extra to ensure that it was new. Because I had purchased the watch for my father as my gift to him at my wedding, I didn't have the time to have the watch sent back to be replaced. I purchased gold polish to try to remedy the situation, but the extent of the damage to the casing was too deep. All in all, I would not buy from this seller again."
2,Disappointed,"I realize this pocketwatch was inexpensive but we were disappointed with it. When it arrived, the gold plating looked tarnished. The watch back had obviously been opened because it was put back on crooked. It was pictured with a nice, red, gift box. However, the gift box was for a wristwatch so the pocketwatch looked goofy in it."
5,???,I dont know what the guy next to me is talking about it getting damaged but he must have bought it used.
4,The World Before This One- Janey DeTommaso,"""The World before This One"" was a motivating book for me. I wouldn't recommend this book for younger people, because the vocabulary and names are very challenging, even for me. It was also hard for me to follow what was going on in the book, so if you have a short attention span, this book isn't for you. This book is a good book for scholars in the literary area. It is a very good legend, but if you aren't interested in a novel told in legend, I would definitely not recommend this book.The main characters in this book are a young man named Crow, and his grandmother. The setting is at a lodge, and in the forest. The climax is when grandmother asks Raccoon, Crow's old friend, to spy on him and see why he doesn't bring home hardly any books from hunting a full day in the forest. The plot is how grandfather stone tells Crow the legends of the world before this one, and it is up to him to see if his fellow villagers are ready to hear the legends."
1,"Seneca is Five-Star, Even in This Volume","This slim volume, part of Penguin's ""Great Ideas"" series, contains three essays from the famed Roman statesman-philosopher: ""On the Shortness of Life,"" ""The Consolation of Helvetia,"" and ""On Tranquility of Mind.""Each of these essays is a small masterpiece of thought and prose, but they can also be found, along with many other stellar pieces, in ""Stoic Philosophy of Seneca: Essays and Letters"" (edited by Moses Hadas) for a comparable price.In short, this book is useful as an introductory gift to someone amiable to learning about Stoic philosophy, as is Epictetus's ""Enchiridion."" Still, the continued publication of the Hadas volume makes it something less than a wise purchase."
3,On The Shortness of Life,"If you are looking for fast light reading this is not it. Seneca reiterates the same theme many times in different ways. It is worth reading on the premise you are having the ""mid life crisis"". It will give light to the things that are important in life. Of course we are not all wealthy, living in Rome AD which makes a big diference. Still the question of are you waiting till you are old and grey to live you life for your self is illuminating!"
5,great presentation,"I disagree with the former reviewer that this is not a wise purchase. These texts are available online if you know how to find them, so part of buying a book these days is the having of a crafted object upon which to enjoy that text. In this regard, this 100 page book has the title nicely embossed into it's paper cover and its art is simple, classic. The paper inside is an off white that has obviously been carefully chosen. Best of all, the type is very crisp and clear and easy to read. When I buy a book I am most concerned with the quality of the type because, in my opinion, muddy text is distracting.I would agree that it is not a definitive reference, but I enjoy soaking in a few gems from many writers on many subjects, and for this reason I am glad that these little great ideas books are being published.I have not seen the other volume that was aforementioned by the previous reviewer and therefore cannot compare its qualities."
3,"Great essays, terrible binding","Love Seneca and these wonderful essays are no exception, BUT ... the thin paperback doesn't take a beating very well, and after one reading, my copy was crumbling in my hands. Pages fell out, the spine bent and never recovered. I bought this specifically to stick in my pocket for a quick read on the bus or subway, and it couldn't stand up to normal wear and tear.These little books ain't that cheap either, and you'd be better off just buying The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca edited by Moses Hadas; a collection that includes the title essay. Oh well, learned my lesson."
3,Tight,this is tight.this is when in Rap you had to have your own Beat.Biting was a No-No.the Jams here still are tight.you can't go wrong here.it might be considered Old School but it's far&away Fresher than most things out nowadays in Rap.
4,smaller than I thought,"I bought these to combat my older brothers army men but when I read the lable I thought it said 15/16 and not 5/16 of an inch. I was astonished at how small they were. I was looking for an army of men not elves (what we now call them). it comes with a plane, two tanks, four jeeps, two flags and their poles and 239 army elves. and to make it worse I had other guys before them, the ratio is worse then david & goliath. it's comical. to see men and elves fighting against my brothers huge forces. and a personal thing my, brother already called america and I am definately not going to be germany! so i made a compromise, I decided to be the north pole. not what I was expecting, but stil very fun."
1,Not Worth It,"When I was young, these mini WW2 soldiers were actually some of the toys we played with the most. Unfortunately, this new version is much poorer quality while being relatively more expensive. The soldiers are identical but colored differently, so don't expect to get German or Japanese or even British soldiers. In addition, the detail is poor and you can clearly see the mold junctions. Not sure what a stealth bomber or a rocket is doing there either."
1,VERY TINY ARMY MEN But FIT INTO TINY TRUCKS in the Set,"I should have read the auction better. I would have seen that the Army Men are 15/16"" Not even 1 Inch Tall. The Military Trucks that came with this set are very Tiny Too, perfect for the Military Men. My Grandsons loved them however, but I worry about My newest Grandchild that will be born in April 2012."
3,What we always wanted...,"but it's not as good as we hoped. This collection of musicians is capable of making beautiful experimental music. I've been following the Kinsella's and their projects ever since Cap'n Jazz and I've always wanted to hear a music-only project, particularly acoustic guitar. When I saw that this CD was out there, I just had to get it. But it's not nearly as good as I know these guys are capable of. Ghosts and Vodka was even better than this. They really need Victor's guitar on here too. I agree pretty much entirely with the other reviewer, except that I really do enjoy the crazy Tom-waitish song, (track 5 I believe)."
2,Out of date,"Unfortunately this book is too far out of date to be of any significant value. The section describing the various types of cameras is no longer accurate and information regarding software, files sizes and formats is of little use.If you are looking for a guide to using your digital camera this book will only give you basic definitions of the terminology and process involved in digital photography. The sections on composition and lighting are good.There is a primer on Photoshop Elements. Again this section is out of date as it refers to Elements. 2.0. (At the time of this review Elements is currently in version 4.0) While this section does provide an adequate introduction to the various capabilities of Elements, most of what is found in this book can be found on Adobe's own descriptions of the product.I have never returned a book to Amazon before but I will be returning this one. It is simply too far out of date and too introductory to be worth the cost."
2,"Steven Greenberg did good job, but the book binding is awful","I bought the book yesterday and already read half of it. The content is great, very helpful and easy to read BUT the book binding is awful. This disappointed me a lot. I am wondering if all 'Alpha' books have same 'quality' of (un)binding...Except this problem, the information provided is really helpful and written in a friendly & clear manner.I enjoy a lot the author's style and personally I would like to see another Steven Greenberg's book, more detailed on Part 3 of the book ('Let's Take Pictures')."
4,good supplement textbook.,This is a very good self-contained text book for entry-level studies. Most of the main principles are high-lighted and explained thoroughlly. I strongly recommended if anyone who has any extra money to spend on this book.
2,Definitely not the best choice for learning complex variables,"I have invested a lot of effort searching for the ""ideal"" textbook on complex variables. I found Bak/Newman to be extremely terse, with minimal detail, inadequate explanations, and unenlightening examples. The book by Brown/Churchill is a very accessible introduction, although I was surprised by the number of typos, and the use of ""multivalued functions"" may cause confusion. I came to the conclusion that the book by Gamelin may be the best overall in terms of clarity of explanation, rigor, and useful detail."
3,A Good Map,"I like this map. It has given me many good uses. It is not the best, but it is ok. I do recommnened it. Have fun!!"
4,Halsey,"It was a very good story of a great admiral during WWII. He sailed ""In Harms Way"" several times. James Cagney was a favorite actor of mine."
5,An indepth review of a Navy Commander's war experience,"My husband and I sat down to watch this on TV and put in a request to purchase it on DVD. This was an amazing portrayal of the heart-wrenching decisions a Navy Commander must make in war time. Cagney was brilliant in this film and my husband, who is a WW II historian, said that it was definitly accurate. A definitive performance."
5,Great Gift!!,This was purchased a gift and it made my friend so happy as he collects James Cagney and didn't even know this one was released yet...hats off to Amazon for keeping up and being on the ball on getting the best releases!!
5,Gallant Hours,My boyfriend thought that he had lost his friends movie so he bought it. Turns out he didn't have it so he is very thankful that he has his own now.It came in ahead of schedule. It was in the condition as stated.
1,DVD-R DEFECTIVE.,"I remembered this movie was great. The one star is for the defective copy of the DVD. Amazon.com was great in replacing the defective item but unfortunately the replacement item was also defective. This don't happen very often. The defective area on the original copy was identical on the replacement copy. The picture was pixilated, frozen and other areas skipping, too. I tried playing the DVD on three different DVD players and each had the same problem. I suspect that the real problem was from the original source where the material was copied from. I wonder if any one who ordered Gallant Hours experienced the same problem with their DVD-R copy. I asked Amazon.com if I can try a another replacement but they rather refund me instead and I settled with it."
2,"Great Story, Faulty Disk","We were so excited when we got this DVD. This movie is one of my husband's favorites. Unfortunately, we were not able to play it. It skipped, had jerky sound, and was a complete disappointment. We cleaned our DVD player, then played two DVDs we knew from experience were okay. Then we again attempted to play this one. No luck. It was still bad, so it's this particular DVD. We will be returning it for credit."
1,Gallant Hours,The DVD had a bad spot that lasted for about 20-30 minutes. I had to skip forward past the bad portion. I got a refund instead of getting another. I was concerned that they all would be the same.I remember the movie from many years ago. It is great but unfortunately my DVD was not so great. Maybe my DVD was the only one that was bad. I don't know.
1,Bad DVD,"I ordered this DVD, and it would not even play on my LG DVD player. I have about 100 DVD's in my collection, and this one was one of only two that would not play on my machine. My DVD player did not appear to recognize that this DVD was actually in the player. Something may be wrong with the formatting on this DVD."
4,Admilral Halsey Biography,"If you are a WW2 U.S.N buff, then this is a must.James Cagney is casted well for this documentary stylefilm,it give you both the American and Japanes views.Recommended."
5,THE GALLANT HOURS,"No actual combat footage or combat scenes, but a great insight to how Adm. Halsey helped turn defeat into victory during the battle for guadalcanal. Beside the victory at Midway, guadalcanal stopped the jap advance toward Australia and put them on the defensive for the rest of the war."
2,Gallant Hours DVD,This DVD was a gift for my father and he wasn't able to play it on his DVD player due to a format problem. I was able to play it on my newer DVD player but that doesn't help him at his house.
2,Disappointing,"I expected this book to be much better than it was. Brooks tries to be too ""cool"" while writing this book, and the reader often struggles just to identify who his audience is, whether it be adolescant boys or grown fathers. The chapter on bullies was highly ridiculous. I've seen plenty of bullies in my day that would love to fight rather than just ruffle someone's feathers. Overall, the book is entertaining but is surely not one of those books you can't put down before finishing."
3,Not for small trailers,"This product would be alright for a larger trailer but not for a 2"" frame. Even with the larger trailer, one strong hit from the boat may break the PVC right off. Use this guide only for a guide, not a guide-on."
5,VERy ESSENTIAL,"THE JAMS HERE NEVER LET UP.Call Me,Let's Get Crackin',Murphy's Law are Some OF The Many Jams here.This Will Rock Anybodys House Party.Funky&Alot Of Fun.Great music all the way thru."
2,Great choice for a Old School Collection of music,"I think OLD SCHOOL VOL.5 have some great song for the Baby Boomer,s from that Era that are still on an poping to-day for any generation that love music"
1,FURIOUS ABOUT PARABENS IN THIS PRODUCT!,"I absolutely love almond-frangranced lotions, so I thought this one by Caswell-Massey would be extraordinary. I didn't even get past the label. It has all different kinds of PARABENS, a known hormone-disruptor. I am really upset that a fine company like CM would put those petroleum-based preservatives in their products. Not only are they really bad for people, but when they go down the drain into our water supplies and eventually arrive in the ocean, these parabens pop up in the cancerous tumors found in fish and water mammals. Caswell-Massey, please reconsider your preservatives."
2,dry and unapplicable,"I found this book quite disappointing, because I found the author's writing style quite dry and not applicable to my life, because it tried to dissect everything down into pieces. Measurements alter the state of the system, and I think this is especially true for relationships: Don't think *too* hard about them, or you will forget to have fun. Which relationship can survive if you don't primarily enjoy being together? So I think this book will help grow the already overly large group of over-thinkers."
4,Great book for yourself & your partner,It a great book that describe you & your partner & why you even got together in the first place. May I suggest you also buy Jung's shadow self book aswell. You don't need a degree in psychology - but it would help to understand your own child's development. Erickson's stages of development is also part of this & aswell as Piaget's.Just a good to start your quest to discover yourself & your partners reason for coming together.
4,Good book,"Good book. Lots of writing exercises which I enjoy. Definitely takes some time to do the writing and it can take some dedication, but interesting ideas in the book."
3,Worth it,"My only problem with this product is that is tends to stretch out after a while and then doesn't fit the keyboard all that well. However, I did only find this problem after losing the plastic tray that it comes in, and as I take my powerbook to class everyday and am constantly folding up the keyboard cover, not keeping it in the packaging probably greatly contributed to this problem."
1,doesn't fit at all way too spendy,I bought two and they both don't fit I have a powerbook and a ibook they fit neither they bulged out and have edges that go past the key board. I was kind of expecting some sort of adhesive on the back of them but there apparently supposed to stay on the keyboard with the force of gravity. who knew I didn't and the quality of the fit was poor. also too expensive. I am returning both. I would give it no stars but that isn't an option
2,waste of money,I absolutely hate the iskin protouch. It doesn't stay on my keyboard correctly and it hinders my typing.
2,A Non-Immersion Read,"The story line was real good. However, this author was intent on translating where certain modern day British towns were in comparison to Roman Britain. He should have provided a map at the beginning of the book with the locations and then I could have really immersed myself in the story. Also, there was a moment towards the end of the book where I just said ""Huh?... what was the author thinking when he finished this book?"" I felt that this was a wasted effort on the authors part, and mine."
1,0 star,"This book is a waste of paper:I just received and opened it: The introduction lets you understand you're going to learn the different guns. Page 1 is full of photos of diverse handguns. One is dubbed: ""French Flintlock Pistol"". The photo shows a back action percussion lock. Hmmm. I jump to ""Swiss Military Rifles"" (I'm a Swiss collector). Two rifles are listed: First a Mod. 1871, cal 10.5 mm. The caption is a Mod. 1869 and the right caliber is 10.4 mm. Second a 1891, cal 7.63x54 Russian caliber Mod 1891... same as Moisin Nagant. From 1889 to 1890, the Swiss Army caliber was 7.5x55. From 1889 to 1957, the rifles were Schmidt Rubin or derivates. There NEVER was a 7.63x54 cal. Moisin among the Swiss Military Rifles. I shut the book down. I had to put a star to review the book, but it's worth none. It's for sale, new, quarter price."
2,Baby Boring~!,"I love Red Dress Ink books, this one...not so much.I am glad I wasn't the only one. I do like finishing books, this one I couldn't. It was taking forever to catch my attention!!"
2,Dreadfully Boring,"I could write a review about the lack of character development and the 300 plus pages dedicated to dirty baby nappies and such -Lets just say, when (if) you finish you'll be wishing you had read something else with a little more substance."
2,Doesn't draw the reader in....,"It's hard for me to get attached to a book, and really drawn into reading, when I simply can't respect the main character. Not quite as bad an experience for me as ""The Think Pink Line"" (also from Red Dress Ink, a line I generally enjoy), but definitely in the same ballpark. One of those books which I kept expecting to get better, but it never did."
5,Lovely,"This massage oil has a lovely light scent, is like silk on the skin, and, as advertised, does not stain clothes or bedding."
5,Nice oil,This oil is really good. It's goes on smooth and silky and is easily absorbed by the skin. The scent isn't too over-powering. The only negative thing I have to say is that I myself haven't had it used on me.
5,I would recommend,"The massage oil is silky and not greasy. I have used it on my husband's shoulders and my sore legs at the end of the day. It doesn't stain our clothing which is a plus. The bottles are bog in my opinion, so the price is justifiable."
1,"Bad sound, I should have known better","What is with these mom & pop sized video productions?I do not believe that I've received one decent video in the last four I've bought be they dog training or how to learn automotive pin-striping, they all have had something terrible wrong with them. Bad sound, bad picture or a combination thereof.Well, this is my last attempt at buying on-line, any sort of training/learning video. It's just too much a pain in the A#% to return them..."
5,Very clear explanation of Black-Scholes,"I like the text because it gives many aspects of the Black-Scholes model that I have not found elsewhere. One may feel that Black-Scholes is an ""old"" model, but it is the genesis of option pricing and understanding its intuition is the key to understanding more complex models. In addition, the text is very readable, but I think even more satisfying if the reader already has some options background."
4,CMOS LINEAR IMAGING VERSUS LASER SCANNING,"The socket 3E utilizes CMOS linear imaging. It is NOT a laser scanner. You can view a detailed analysis of difference between the two technologies by visiting the manufacturers web site or by doing a search for ""cmos linear imaging"". I have a 3 E that I use with a Dell Axim x50 PDA. It works fine. Socket says that this is an entry level scanning device. I haven't used any of their laser scanners and plan to get a 5M to compare against the 3E. The reviewer who stated that the 3E was not a laser scanner is correct. The 3 E is a CMOS linear imaging device.Update - I did get a 5M to compare to the 3E and it blows the 3E out of the water. The 5M IS a true laser scanner - it will scan accurately in low light and high light situations. It will scan accurately several feet away from the target. If you get any Socket scanner and don't have software you can obtain drivers and software from Socket's web site."
5,Great Adventure In To My Childhood,"It is sad that Jack Wild died at such an early age.I loved him when he made an appearence at this special.Its sad that they did not hire Charles Nelson Riley did not do Hoo Doo and also Billy Hayes did not do witchipoo.It would be interesting to hear Billy Hayes on here if she sees this explain why she did not do this.But hey HR Pufnstuff is a great part of my childhood and I,m better for having watched it every week."
3,A pleasure for my child...a bit of a disappointment for me.,"My 3 year old loves it, but the Bradys didn't do any of their songs. The quality wasn't as good as I had expected, but she enjoys it. I rated it 3 stars because the little ones will love it, but if you're looking for nostalgia, this won't bring back the memories of the old shows."
1,Buyer beware!,"Caution! These may be knock-offs. L'Oreal discontinued this product more than a year ago, so finding such a large supply is suspect in itself. We purchased three of these and now are even more suspicious. Each box came in loose, sloppy shrink-wrap. The box itself looked normal, but inside the labels were all black-and-white, and the instruction sheet appeared to have been photocopied. My wife used one box and said the odor wasn't the same as it used to be. And as for the color result, she said it wasn't what she expected. Caveat emptor!"
1,Does not really work.,"I usually like L'Oreal, but of late the products seem to have more water and less product.Natural Blond does not work unless your hair is white or blond already.."
3,Overly Drying,"Use only on the most oily days and then only sparingly. Will overly dry your skin, your skin will then try to compensate by making more oil."
4,Swriffer Cloths,"I live in a small studio and these with the wet cloths are great for the quick clean ups. 4 stars not really for the product, but that you have to buy in bulk through amazon.com. On the bright side I have enough cloths to last me a half the year. Also use this product at my home in Nevada. Great for prepping a hardwood floor (especially if you have a shedding dog)."
2,Child's Play,This set is for non-volleyball players. If you're remotely interested in playing at anything other than very basic pop the ball over the net then do not purchase this set. The net is extremely low and of little use for playing.
4,Its Like a Sex in the City but way more fun,"I have been watching the whole series on Roku and paid for this installment because I missed the gals. Having gone on a similar cruise, I thought this particular show was a hoot."
3,A financial textbook review and study guide,"It gives some information about financial management in layman's terms, but it could do a better job giving explainations and details about finance topics"
3,Decent for the price,"I bought these for work. I work in a warehouse doing inventory, and well I needed some protection for my hands. However, I have to constantly attach labels to boxes and work with a touch screen pda, so I needed some dexterity. I picked up a set, and while comfortable and padded well, they are not durable. After a few weeks of use, the seems were coming undone, holes were developing on stress points (palm/thumb area). Overall, these did not last two months. A coworker as bought a set recently, and well..they ended up wearing out as quickly as mine. For the price you can't complain, but I would rather spend a few extra bucks and get a pair that would last a bit longer. I currently am usingYoungstown Glove 03-3110-80-XL Carpenter Plus Performance Glove XLarge, Grayand these have lasted close to a year."
3,fingerless gloves,These are great fingerless gloves. I do woodworking and need some protection against splinters etc. I also have arthritis in my hands and they help with support while working with wood. You still get hand protection but with finger control. I would recommend them for women and men.
4,SUG GLOVE good work glove,"My husband had a pair of Sug Gloves that he loved, and used them so much that they needed to be replaced. He could not find them at the store that he originally purchased them from, so I found that I could order them at Amazon.com. The gloves are not exactly the same as his original pair. The thumbs were too long and I had to cut them off and and try to hem them. That was rather difficult for me! Other than that, the gloves are up to par with the original pair that he had."
2,"Disappointed,AGAIN",CHEAPLY MADE. FALL APART IN FIRST USE. THE ONES THAT DIDN'T FALL APART IN THE FIRST USE WORE OUT IN THE FIRST WEEK OF USE. DEFINITELY NOT MARINE PROOF.
5,"Comfortable,fits, great for many activities","I have a hard time wearing gloves because of the lack of dexterity. I also have a hard time finding small gloves that fit my hands well. I've found that these help keep my hands warm in lower temperatures when I need manual dexterity, such as walking my dogs and outside chores, and save my palms from the metal splinters I'm prone to getting at work. Kids love them for bike riding, with their assorted brightly colored stripe. Way cool!"
2,size is wrong,"The overall design is good but the sizes make them unusable.I purchased both medium and large since my hand falls between the two, in both cases there is far too much extra space around the fingers and the palm is too small.After spending 2+ hours I managed to resize the large to almost fit me, the palm is still the size of a normal medium.This product is intended for people with sausages for fingers and tiny palms."
3,"OK, but not as durable as we were hoping.","These gloves were very nice, just not durable enough for the heavy lifting job that needed to be done. We just need something heavier duty to last longer."
2,Fell apart FAST!,After as little as 3 days all the stitching at the fingertips really started looking messy and came undone! I'm really disappointed the quality as the thread is loose Everywhere! I doubt they will last another 2 months at lightest of use!
2,not as good as I thought,"One finger is already unraveling.They are comfortable, but guess I'll have to reinforce the ends of each finger if I want them to last.They have a cheaper feel than other gloves I've used.The little ball on the string to tighten around the wrist is kind of stupid, what's the deal? couldn't chip in for velcro or one of those plastic snaps? really?Anyhow, I won't be buying more of these gloves. I'll go buy something else that will last and not unravel after just 2 times wearing."
5,Great Motocycle Glove,I use these gloves for summer motorcycle riding and they are the best I have found. They are wonderful. I especially love the easy off finger tabs. They are light weight. I plan to keep several pairs on hand.
5,Perfect,"I work in a stockroom handling everything from lawn tractors to refrigerators and these groves are perfect. They fit well, and they are fingerless, which not only makes it easier to type, but I can also use touch screens without having to take them off. The cloth on top of the thumbs comes in handy for wiping sweat from your forehead, and the flaps on the fingers let you take them off at a moments notice. These are a great product and the only glove I buy."
5,Love these,"Durable, fit well, stay snug, warm, great work gloves. You can't touch this deal. Prime shipping- I mean come on, this is great!"
5,Good 4 button remote,"Unlike another reviewer, I had no problem setting the dip switches on my replacement Multicode remote. I have used a Multicode system on our gates, and the garage, shop, and detached garage doors for 12 years. My old remotes were wearing out and I was glad to find that Multicode still sold units that would work. The range on my remote is quite good and I have no complaints about the size. One minor problem is that modern vehicles seem to have thicker visors and the clip doesn't hold well."
1,"It is a lovely item, but...","The big BUT is the instructions are totally inadequate. They do not explain how to set four buttons with two dip switches. There is no doubt a way, but it is neither obvious nor laid out in the instructions. Sad, I really need a four button opener that I can actually use."
2,Works but not as intended,"I purchased this remote to use with an existing door setup at my volunteer fire hall. We have four bays and use the same brand single door openers (like this:Linear 3089 300 MHz One-Button Visor Remote(See Tech. Details Below)) to open them. Rather than purchase four single door openers, I assumed a four door opener would work for this setup (after all, we are already using this brand of products). This turned out to not be the case.In order to use this product, you need to change the codes on your doors to match the remote, because they only give you two sets of switches to control what the four buttons do. I can't go around changing the codes on our doors. If they had built in four sets of switches (one to control each button) it would have worked perfectly.In the end I was able to get it to work with two doors (top two buttons open/close one, the bottom two buttons open/close the other)."
4,Not what I expected,"The item was delivered in a timely mannner as described, but did not function the way I thought it would. I wanted it to open two gates and two garage doors, which it cannot do. It can only open two gates or doors with the code that you set. It cannot 'learn' a code from the garage door. I don't understand what the four buttons are for if they will only work two items. I have read the directions over and over and still don't understand."
5,Two Mysteries for You to Solve!,"You get the same clues, can you solve these two mysteries before Detective Tommy Preston does?Monkey's Clue mystery : Max the chimpanzee was the subject of some very important experiments. When someone broke into the lab and stole the research and broke the equipment, Max began to behave strangely. Was he trying to communicate something? Can you sold the mystery before Tommy Preston does?Stolen Sapphire mystery : Before the science fair even began, a sapphire disappeared - right before everyone's eyes. Where was the sapphire when everyone was searched? How could the thief get the sapphire out of the building? Tommy Preston spotted the important clue. Can you?"
3,For the child with an imagination.,My son has autism and he loves to play with this sphere. Though I don't how a child would play with it other than expanding it and shrinking it. My son likes to put his head through it. His Occupational Therapist has this in the room and my son always asks for it. So I just bought one for Christmas. Will see what else we can come up with.
4,Interesting Hoberman Sphere,I originally purchased this for myself because I was curious about its construction and value in demonstrating the theory of volume.Good educational tool; limited 'fun' factor. I don't think I would purchase this for a child under 10 mainly because it is rather delicate by design.
4,Very nice toy!,"Very nice toy. It's pretty big, but not too. I get the feeling that it's very robust. A lot of fun to play with, whether you're a kid or an adult!"
3,didn't last long,"This sphere came apart less than 2 hours after it was given to my 7 year old grandson. This is the fourth sphere I have given to grandchildren and the others have lasted years. One of the small plastic pieces that hold the rods together came apart. Glue will not hold it together and still allow the rods to move. It is too much trouble to mail it back, so I just bought a replacement somewhere else. I just hope this doesn't mean that the quality of this toy has slipped."
4,expanding sphere,great fun huge scientific gift. Exactly what I was looking for! glows in the dark! also has an attachment to hang it! super fun! great gift!
5,Durable and educational,I love watching my son play with this shere. He likes to climb inside and let it collapse and then make it large again. You can see him trying to figure out how it works. He stretches it at times and it holds up so it is well worth the money.
4,Fun!,"I got this for my 4 year old autistic grandson and he loved playing with it. He had a lot of fun watching it open up from such a small size to 30 inches, which was big enough for him to climb into and sit in. You can also toss it and as you toss it, it opens up. The only thing I wish it did was stayed open on its own. In order to keep it open, you have to either sit in it, or hold it up from the top hinge. It also comes with an attachment to put on your ceiling to make it into a mobile."
5,Fun for all ages,"I ordered this for some kids I know who are 12 and 14. Even the adults enjoyed it. It was a real hit, sturdy, colorful, and it got passed around all day as everyone wanted to play with it and analyze it."
2,I love the concept but the quality ruined the toy,"I bought this toy for my 6yo daughter and she enjoyed it so much until the connectors started falling off. I wish it had been constructed for normal use the concept is outstanding. I have seen these spheres in therapist's offices and they appear to hold up under a tremendous amount of play, perhaps our sphere was a lemon, either way, no one can use it now."
4,Great Demonstration,"I used this at our Summer reading program at the Public Library. I used it to demonstrat the size of the universe compared to what we see and what there really is. The theme for the program was ""Dream Big"". Great learning tool."
4,Fun For All,"Great Toy.Our six year old can't put it down. Our 14 year old and 22 year old love to play with it.Adults are fascinated.Great fun, creative, and needs no batteries or instructions.A+"
2,Broke within the first two minutes out of the box!,"We were so excited to give this toy as a gift, that we had to open it up and let my daughters (5 and 7) see how it works before we wrapped it. My five-year-old was laughing as she was slowly closing up the giant ball when we heard a snap and two blue ""end pieces"" flew in opposite directions.We're making repairs to give it, but I don't have much confidence that it will survive long with its new owner. Its disappointing."
5,"Bought this for my son, he really likes it.","So far so good, has not broken yet, but remember you have to be gentle with this, it's not a ""toy"" or a ""throw around ball"" it's more for understanding the physics and design, while providing a hands on experience. Recommend this for age 12 or above. Enjoy!"
5,Very nice,"I'm late getting around to writing this review, but after 6 years I have no complaints aside from it's hard to move around due to the weight. That can't be helped in the case of a CRT. If you want lighter, get an LCD, but the LCD may not hold up as long."
4,product good-shipping another story,"The T.V. is actually very good and was a gift. The box was received at work by my warehouse guys, no outside damage therefore they signed for the box. Upon giving the gift to my daughter 2 weeks later we discovered the t.v. to be damaged. It had been dropped or something, but because we signed free and clear I am stuck with a damaged t.v. I suggest any shipment as this even if the box looks good, to take item out and look it over before signing. This was not a cheap gift but I am stuck with it."
5,Awesome Tv for under 500.00,"At bestbuy all the tv's that were 500.00 27 inch were SDTV not HD and they were horrible, saw this on amazon shipped to house and was awesome. Using it for games and DVDS. Also got a 50 inch samsung and 42 inch samsung so I use this one for games and stuff, Really convinent for the price good quality."

5,SILLY,I LOVE THIS SONG BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD AND IT WILL PROBABLY RELATE TO EVERY FEMALE THAT HAS EVER LIKED OR LOVED A GUY.
2,only one cd,"Beware, although it says five cd set on the picture on the website, there is only one cd in this order."
4,A good college text with nice pictures,"Very good on old bones and site mechanics,but fails on Greek archeology which is actually the beginnings of archeology.It is somewhat unfair in the analysis of foods with a North American origin as well.Pine Nuts and Acorns are left out as well as cactus.The Polynesian civilization is completely absent.I have to say that I learned somethings from the datings and the mapswhich are extensive and annotated well.The text is well written and as nearly up to dateas a text can be."
4,A great resource,I like this book a lot. I found it very informative and helpful in my massage therapy practice.
5,Michael Chapdelaine Re-replay,This is a GREAT CD and you will LOVE it! Continue to play day after day!
4,Replay CD,CD arrived in a few days and was exactly what I wanted. I feel this was a very good value.
2,Poor Layout,"I am very disappointed with the presentation and cannot even comment on the clues as may not use the book. There are two puzzles to a page without enough blank space to make notes or test answers, requiring a separate piece of paper. The answer grid is fuzzy without defining lines between columns and rows and is very small as well @ 2"" x 3 "". I have to copy the puzzle and magnify it to letter size on my printer in two steps which defeats the convenience of a spiral bound book."
1,This is recommended for 8 year olds and up?!?,"This is safe to give to an 8 year old ? (suggested age range) per the item.Better yet, how about my nephew. Can't wait for that birthday party. My sister-in-law will be thrilled.Good job..."
3,Best Cleanser on the Market,This is used by many plastic and cosmetic surgeons to aid in germ warfare prior to surgery.
3,Nerds nuptial!,"Booger (Curtis Armstrong) and expectant father Louis (Robert Carradine) reunite with most of the gang for Booger's nuptials with nice rich girl Jennie (Corrinne Bohrer). Trouble is, her father (Joseph Bologna) and sleazy brother-in-law (Stephen Davies) have other ideas. Made-for-TV movie is better than expected with some likable characters, despite lack of raunchiness that made the original film so popular."
2,"Better than 3, but not as good as 1 or 2","At least this movie had many of the original Nerd kings in it! That was one thing that made 3 so bad!!!! This movie had its moments, but did little to nothing to take us in a new direction with the Nerds. If the coach could see you now Stan and Ogar!! ""When you were a baby your father looked down at you in your crib. He had but one hope for you, that you would grow to be a man. Well look at you now!! You just got your A** wooped by a bunch of G.D. Nerds! NERDS!!!!!!!!!!"""
5,ignition wire set.,"i had order this wire set as for a back up. cause you never know when you gonna need it, if youre going on a long trip.this wire set has help me and still have it as my back up.and for the price you cant beat it.i would go with this set if youre going on a long trip and if you havn't change your wire set in a long while.will buy again.thank you."
4,I am impressed!,"My sister introduced me to this product and voiced her positive impression. I was dubious but figured it was worth the test as I was tired of smelling the cat box in each of our 2 bathrooms. The improvement is unmistakable. I would not be without this product again. You can read for yourself online about zeolite rocks and other products, I for one am impressed!"
4,Solid DVD,"Good general overview and helpful to watch someone doing it in front of you. Includes a lot of detail, however I learned just as much watching YouTube and for free. Kind of expensive, hence four stars. Overall very useful though."
1,Review Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Itch Relief spray,I purchased the Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Itch-Relief Moisturizing Spray for my daughter who has eczema and cannot tolerate most creams. The itching did not diminish and the product failed to moisturize her skin.
1,dont buy!!,"It says in the item description that there are 20 8 inch lace medallions. when they came in the mail there were only 5. so i paid over a dollar for a 8 inch piece of paper. I plan on using these for my wedding invitations and they are still pretty and will work for the cause, my main concern that people are thinking they are getting a certain amount but aren't even getting half of that.So if u do buy this product only expect 5."
5,Outshines the rest,"Buy this movie! You will laugh until it hurts. Although produced on a small budget, the story and performances by the cast are at the top of their class. It is the best gay-themed comedy I have seen. I have viewed it several times and still laugh-out-loud at many of the scenes.I had the privilege and pleasure of meeting the writer/director while this film was being showcased at our film festival. At that time the film was not quite finished and it was great having him tell about the process and intent in various scenes. I look forward to future projects created by him."
1,Case and disc arrived shattered,"The case came out of the envelope with small shards of plastic. I wasn't to concerned until I opened the case and seen the disc was busted also...in two pieces. I think I will reorder from CD Universe, I usually have better luck with them anyway. By the way, there was no damage to the envelope that the disc was mailed in."
1,You Shouldn't meet this movie,"Plot as old as the hills and very poor acting by stereo type characters.Nothing here to entertain and nothing to see, despite the cover photo. Watch Big Eden instead."
2,"Shrill and tiresome, but its heart is in the right place","If non-stop, shrieking fake Southern accents, garish stereotypes, and humor as subtle as being hit in the head with a cast iron frying pan send you rolling in the aisles, then you will probably love this movie. I was raised in a subtler, less obnoxious South than the one celebrated here, and I am too happy being gay to relate to this hysteria, so I hated it.But any gay movie that celebrates being gay deserves some support, so I gave it two stars just for having its heart in the right place. God bless it, its makers, and anybody who can enjoy it."
1,How did this even get made?!!!!,"The only explanation for all the three and four star reviews is the director must have a lot of friends! This is truly abysmal - like some gay amateur theatre improv exercise circa 1975. The plot is painfully dumb, the characters defy human logic at every turn and the acting is beyond bad, but sadly not entertainingly so. You've been warned!"
1,Streaming quality horrible,It has nothing to do with the movie. It's the streaming quality that I have a MAJOR problem with. Even though the connection shows 5 green bars (maximum) the streaming is choppy to the point that I can't enjoy watching the movie.What a shame!
4,entertaining movie,Jokingly focuses in family dynamic. You need to think why a couple of times but it gets to the point w/o offending
4,Delightful li'l movie,I thought this was a delightful little ol' film. It's the Sordid Lives married Auntie Mame and had a gay baby on a modest budget.
4,If you love Auntie Mame,"If you love Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell, you'll appreciate the loving homage that this indie pays to a scene in that marvelous 1958 film. This movie's denouement is a wonderful reinterpretation that classic scene during which Mame Dennis fantastically derails the engagement of her beloved Patrick Dennis to the ghastly Gloria Upson. Only in this film, the betrothal derailment is accomplished not with pickled rattlesnake and flaming cocktails, but with flaming drag glamazons and a nude portrait of George Herbert Walker Bush. No. Joke.While this film is set in Birmingham, AL, the actors' accents were inconsistent. I know this fact because I grew up in Alabama. The actors portraying the aunt and mother gave good approximations of the accents of educated, upper-middle-class, Alabama females of (about) age 60. The son and the rest of the cast were less spot-on.In summary, I laughed aloud, several times. What more could you want on a Christmas afternoon?"
1,Not as good as previews,"We were led to believe this would be a comedy. It was really too complicated, too cliched to be entertaining."
4,"Very Funny Flick, But Not Very Accurate","You Should Meet My Son is a really funny movie with great acting and at least one plot twist that I didn't see coming. At the same time, I fault this (and many other gay-themed movies) with unfairly stereotyping the ex-gay movement. The ""ministry"" depicted in this film is nowhere close to ex-gay ministries I've encountered. What I do appreciate about this film more than anything, is it's very accurate depiction of the rudeness of ""twinks"" toward older gay men and how gay bar crowds can come across as being very anti-social to anyone new or ""different"" from the typical bar ccustomers."
4,Deja Vu,"Does anyone else see the 'Auntie Mame' references in this movie? or is it just me? Either way, I found it delightfully funny, campy, and sweet. It may not win any awards for best 'Gay' themed movie of the year, but it certainly made me laugh, and is that what comedys are supposed to do?"
4,A FANTASTIC FEEL GOOD COMEDY,"At long last we have a gay film that is beautifully photographed and not a shakey camera in site (very very rare for most gay films).It doesn't pretend to be anything original, story wise and may even be silly at times but at least the writers know how to write comedy ( something rare for USA films).The film is one continuous laugh after another and the cast are superb.When was the last time you saw a gay film where they actually had an ensemble of very talented people who could act?. If you are feeling down in the dumps then see this great film as it is a great feel good film that you will want to see over and over again.The entire cast and crew must be proud of their achievment in giving us such a fantastic comedy.I have been so disappointed with gay movies for a long time.Nice to know that this film gives me faith in the fact that they can make a great gay film if they have the talent like this film has."
4,Cute movie with great characters.,"This movie is entertaining without the usual ""skin"" that is shown to keep a movie interesting. The mother and aunt characters are played very well. The supporting cast is an eclectic group of interesting people. Overall I enjoyed the movie."
4,fun and campy,A fun little film about a mom's quest to find a nice guy for her gay son. The mom's heart is in the right place and silly mayhem unfolds.Maybe a good rental for people who only want EPIC films in their private library...but a great little film which takes viwers on a fun adventure...none the less.
2,Pretty Bland,I purchased this movie after reading the reviews and I must say I was extremely surprised that so many people had so many good things to say about a movie that had so little to offer. It was like watching a bad high school play. Both the acting and writing were on a pretty bland level. I would not recommend it at all.
3,wonderful,"I must say that as a start review it's my first the acting was a lot to be considered however the script made up for it, The one liners that appear throughout this movie click and would bring a smile to all i have already recommended it to friends for the fun and some great good looking guys It was fun and that is what makes a good evening with a movie"
1,Drags along at a snail's pace,"This book may have had a point, but took so long getting there that I was half asleep. While the plot was a good idea, Gordon dwells way too deeply into abstract ideas rather than the interesting story that is going on. Her writing is also condescending at times- ""You probably want to know..."" and ""You probably think..."" are used way too liberally. This book just dragged too much for me."
3,Pearl,"I found this book difficult. Each section was well written, but the way it was put together seemed very disjointed to me.It was replete with unhappy people and one choosing to do a very bizarre thing. I read about half and then gave up.I may go back to it to find out how it ends, but I'm not sure its worth all the time involved."
3,Ambitious and interesting; the narrator was too manipulative,"What an ambitious novel! Good in lots of ways. But the main character is really the narrator, and for me, this very insistent narrator weakens the impact of the story by herding me forcefully through the book. I think the story would have stood on it's own without so much narration and certainly without the narrator's un-subtle directives about how to read, think, react, to the book.But all that said, still an ambitious work about terrorism and how seductive it can be.'Apassionata' by Eva Hoffman is a truly fine work on this theme - shorter, pithier, compelling, and thought provoking."
2,Short story disguided as a novel.,"I forced myself to finish this book. Other than the title character, Pearl, and a boy named Stevie Donegan, I had no sympathy for anybody in the story. On page 4, Pearl's mother finds out that her daughter has chained herself to tree and is starving herself to death in Dublin, and it takes until page 180 before the mother even makes it to Dublin. The story is loaded with backstories and expostion, and the 3rd person narrator is extremely intrusive. Additionally, it suffers from narrative design problems. There are some well written passages, even though the book itself feels like a good first draft but not a good story. Read at your own risk."
3,Is Pearl under a bushel or is she allowed to shine?,"The first word that comes to mind regarding this book is 'message.' Gordon's message is crystal clear and timeless; during certain events in an individual's life forgiveness becomes as necessary as food and water. And lack of forgiveness can kill.Perhaps the bleak nature of the setting and the cold and colorless passages in which the characters find themselves best represent the world's tired spiritual reality and civilization's rampant hostility. I just wish these things were not quite so triumphant in all of the characters--including Pearl's mother, the rational presence at the heart of the storm. Regardless of this or maybe because of it, the book makes a fearless statement about our times.It's just that one hungers for the occasional absence of cynicism to combat the darkness."
2,slooooooooooow,Not a book to read for pleasure. The author seems to belabor her own issues here. Haven't we all heard enough about what it was like to come of age in the late sixties? The narrator's supplications to the reader are tiresome. How many rhetorical questions can one reader be expected to mull over? This technique would work better in a choose-your-own-adventure book.
1,Incorrect basic anatomy,I was very disappointed that a very basic body parts were incorrect. Page 228 mentions a tube coming out the her vagina.A tube would be placed in her urethra to the bladder to drain urine. There are several other places that this mentioned.I find it disappointing that such a error could be made with no one picking it up before the book was published.
2,Incorrect Information,I'm only about 30 pages into the book and already I've found information that's incorrect. The author states that bobby Sands was 28 when he died....he was only 27. Not sure I want to finish ready a book that has information that is so easy to verify incorrect....
5,Nice little dry bag,"It holds more than I thought it would, and keeps them dry as expected.I would most certainly recommend to others"
1,Worthless piece of crap,"I used this bag while kayaking 50 miles down the Little Manistee river in Michigan last weekend. To make a long story short, it is entirely worthless. A dry bag has one function. Keep your crap dry. This bag failed miserably, despite being used exactly as directed. I would suggest buying 5 gallon ziploc bags and putting them in a backpack over using this product. I spent hours the first night of the trip drying my sleeping bag and clothes by the fire because of this worthless bag. Do NOT buy this unless you want to have to bag everything inside your bag in ziploc bags, which sort of defeats the purpose of using a dry bag. MIGHT be suitable if you put stuff inside it and then put it inside a pack and got caught in a moderate rain for an hour or so."
3,Good Picture Book,"Like all Max and Ruby books this is also very limited in dialogue or strong story line. We like to pick through the page depicting his toys and play ""find the toy""."
3,Fair to middling,"Purchased this book for an Irish Studies program and found it full of interesting information. However, as the course progressed fewer and fewer pieces of relevant information were included.A very good book to own for reference, but it would not be considered, by any stretch of my imagination, as encyclopedic and all encompassing. Purchase this book as a good addition to a library, but not the one and only source."
2,Korean War Stories (a revisionist version),"This movie may have gotten an Award , but it is a story that is incomplete & inaccurate .See ""The Korean War"" (Fire & Ice)DVD or The History Channel (Korea The Forgotten War)DVD.These two DVD's are accurate & complete.I was with the First & Third Marines for the entire War (36 Months)."
3,Colorful but...,"I also have this book and agree with the reviews that it is a colorful and beautiful book. However I also agree with the reviewer that said ""not a design book"". (There weren't any reviews yet when I bought it.) As an interior designer looking to design a space in Moroccan / Spanish style for a client, it was not very helpful. It's the interiors I want to see. I'll order the Moroccan Interiors by Lisa Lovatt-Smith, it has great reviews."
4,Acorn gets an A!,"This is my second pair of Acorn slippers, and the first pair lasted me a little over 2 years, which I think is great, considering they were fairly cheap, VERY comfortable, wearable when running outside to get the mail or let the dogs out, and VERY warm. I love the crazy new look. This pair is just as comfortable as the first pair I had."
3,Good slips for a good price,"Comfy and cute slippers, seem pretty durable after 1 month of use. Good buy at $18 w/ free shipping. Warm enough for inside use."
1,Manufacturer customer service TERRIBLE,"I ordered a pair of slippers from the manufacturer, they charged my credit card, and then never sent them. When I called they said they are out of stock and they are not making that model anywhere, and insisted they didn't charge my credit card. I am left to try to get my money back by disputing it with my credit card company."
4,Warm but big,"These slippers are very warm but run kind of large. I wear a women's size 11 so I purchased the XL which was supposed to be 10-12. It's much closer to a 12 than an 11 though so they don't stay on very well. Otherwise, the slippers are great."
3,Acorn slipper Natural with tan suede,"I purchased these slippers looking for something more substantial than the usual foam type slippers. The look like the picture. Another reviewer said, they run large, so I ordered a size down. I usually wear an 8 and I got the 6 1/2 -7 1/2. They are wide in the back half of the slipper, but the length is pretty true, so they are too short. I'm hoping the will stretch lengthwise. The next size 8-9 would have been too big. Maybe if you like to wear slippers with thick socks, the true size would work for you. The sole is a good indoor/outdoor sole and grabs well on my uncarpeted stairs. These seem pretty well made, but I think these are a bit overpriced.Still haven't found my perfect slipper yet..."
5,these slippers are super comfy cozy,i love acorn slippers. they fit my wide feet without a problem and are super soft and comfy. you can throw them in the washer if you like and they come out just fine.
1,One slipper much larger than the other!,"These had to be returned because one slipper was much larger than the other. It's too bad - they seemed like they'd be nice slippers. As others have mentioned on here, ACORN's quality control is quite poor."
5,would buy again,These are comfortable and I have not tried anything better. This is the third or fouth pair I have had. I am disapponted that the sole cushioning effect wears down and does not last as long as I would like.
3,So Soft.,The sole was sewn crooked. But I still love them. But they are not worth more then 10.00$ Also I gave these as a gift and I am embarrased.
2,Not Very Comfortable with Barefeet,"I think these slippers might be comfortable if you like to wear socks and slippers. But as a barefoot slipper wearer, I found the seams abrasive. Also the Acorn logo inside dug into the soles of my feet.I liked the colors and pattern but ended up returning them; I need something softer!"
5,The Best,"Excellent conformation, solide soles, and, most importantly very comfortable. Moc style slipper you can walk to the patio and water roses."
4,as nasty they be: the uncensored story of luther campbell,"I have read this book before and it was so good that my college roomate took the book with him. it is excellent history of the notorious rap group mogul luther Campbell, in his tell all history of the dirty rap game. and how he came to be the first black own record company CEO."
1,Misrepresentation,"I was very disappointed in this book. I got it because of the authors Sulieman Allen, LeAnne Howe, and Julian Lang, none of whom are in the book. The writers in the book are all very good, but I really wanted to read more of LeAnne Howe's work!"
1,misleading product destroyed what I intended to fix,"This ""all purpose gel"" isn't like gel at all and is the runniest glue I've ever seen. The second the drop came out of the tube it ran down the side of the plastic faster than water and then got into the on/off button area. In my frenzy to clean up this horrible stuff before it dried, I bonded all over my fingers, destroyed the device I wanted to fix by because the buttons were now inoperable, and it is impossible to get off your fingers, even with adhesive remover. I threw the tube away after squeezing more of it onto a piece of plastic, just to see if there were any gel-like characteristics of the product anywhere in the tube of it, but no, it is all runny. The entire thing is filled with a super fast moving thin clear liquid which runs everywhere and it's fumes can hurt your eyes. It is one of the worst products I've ever purchased."
3,So-so,There were only a few songs that I recognized and liked. The rest of the songs that I never heard of weren't so great. I would have given lower ratings but that would be pushing it too far.
4,Just what I wanted,"I have played guitar for nearly 30 years. I would consider myself a highly skilled guitarist, but learning some things that others may have learned in the first days of playing. I never did have any organized lessons, I simply taught myself. So, now as an mature musician, I am taking time to learn things I never learned before. This video has been very useful to my specific needs."
3,"Looks great, but the bottom is not heavy","I would say the best part of this great-looking set are handles. They are very comfortable! But unfortunatelly the bottom is not as heavy as I hoped, it's thin and doesn't distribute heat evenly."
4,surprise,"These pans are actually quite heavy and seem really durable, so I'm really happy with that! But sadly the smaller pan has scratched the larger pan in the shipping process. I don't really know how that one happened... but I'm still happy with the pans."
4,....what can you expect for the price?,...gave them away as a gift. I have toooo many pans as it is ...all of high quality.....and most from Amazon.I will go along with the other reviewers.
5,"Super cheap, but super quality","I am guilty of usually buying the cheapest thing I can find and suffering with low quality. However, my dream has come true with finding these inexpensive pans that are sturdy, heavy, well non-stick coated and ergonomically designed."
4,Smaller Than They Appear,"I'm glad I got these. The price was really good and so I think you're getting a really good value here.I've used the large skillet several times and I think the construction is as good as it looks in the picture. That is, the handle is pretty nice, and the bottom of the skillet is nice and thick and feels sturdy. The non-stick seems durable.What you should know, is that 8"" and 10"" are the outer diameters of the skillets, and the skillets are pretty shallow. So even the large skillet isn't that big. If you try and make a stir fry for 2 adults using the large skillet, it will work, but you'll have to be careful not to flip food out while moving the food around with your spatula.In conclusion...it's a great value, and great skillets to have in your repertoire. But, if you're like me, you'll also want a real big skillet or wok in your collection."
3,"Decent non-stick performance, poor balance","These pans are handle heavy. While empty they almost wont stay seated on the range without help.They are incredibly cheap though, and the non-stick performance is pretty good."
5,Amazing!!!,I wish I could give this product 10 stars!! I bought these two skillets as a set for 7.99 and got two very high-quality skillets that I absolutely love to use!!! I am still shocked I got such a deal on them; kitchenware is so expensive these days. I got them in red and they are absolutely gorgeous. I love using them and would recommend them to anyone!!! I might buy more just because.
5,Absolute Beauties!,Great quality! - Have been using them regularly for the past six months and are still as good as new. Nonstick coatings in wonderful conditon too! Sizes are also perfect and cleaning them is extremely easy.Unbeatable price! - Best $8 I have ever spent! (Was also eligible for Free Shipping)Would definitely recommend it!
4,Better than expected,"Lets face it, these types of items wear out fast. I find that each couple of years these items become got-to-stick pans, at least at this price that performance is reasonable. Plus the stay cool handle works great."
4,Can you please pack them better?,"Great skillets for the price, I love the handles, they are sturdy and have silicone heat resistant grips so you don't get burned. They also go stove to oven, resisting up to 350 o F. HOWEVER, mine came all banged up from the shipping. They packed them on a huge box and they moved around causing the teflon to get scratched. My big skillet is no longer round, but for the price I paid, I'll get over it. I'm not the only person that has made this comment about the packaging. At least I'm not the only one frustrated about it."
5,Great little pans,"These pans work great and can survive daily use. They are a bit thin, but cook very well!"
5,Love these pans,I absolutely love these pans - I use them everyday and cannot complain about anything - great deal for the price
2,Arrived dented,"Both the smaller and the larger pans arrived with noticeable dents. The dents aren't impairing the functioning, and I am pretty lazy, so I am not bothering to return them (especially considering how cheap they were). But, if you care about such things, you might want to keep looking."
1,Farberware fine- Shipping BAD,I ordered 4 sets of these for gifts and when they arrived every 10 inch skillet was scratched so badly that the finish was damaged on every single one of them. I was not pleased but decided not to send them back as I was dealing with more serious problems at the time. Just wanted to warn people about the problem with shipping and let others know what to expect. If you want them to be scratch and dent free you will not be happy with them.
2,"Good for a while, but not forever...","I've had my setup for well over a year now. Never had any problems with it until I switched to using the Coaxial Digital Audio input. Now it will play for a little while, get crackly and then kill the sound for a while. After a pause, it eventually comes back. There's a reason this is at the price point that it is."
2,Disappointed!,"This black-white book had started very well with a clear explanation of what a database is.Unfortunately, from chapter 3 on, ill-explained notions are introduced and I got lost. I would like to have more connection with a practical case, it is not the case.Probably I am too stupid, or too new in the field of mySQL. A pity!"
2,"Great for databases in general, falls apart on administrivia","If you are fairly familiar with the concept of a database, this book could very well be all you need to get going. My issue with it is that it skimps on some of the very basic stuff. For example, it never goes over the syntax of the create call for creating a database, doesn't explain calling mysql at the command prompt as a particular user, gives you 11 chapters on manipulating data before showing you how to create a table, waits for chapter 28 to mention administering users, and puts datatypes in the appendix. These are the first things I wanted to learn. By the time I was done googling these concepts, I got pretty good at mySql and knew where to find better resources. At that point, the book became a very light reference."
4,A good start but missing many parts,"This is a good starter book, and I bought it thinking it would be a good supplement to O'Reilly's Learning SQL version. Since I started with the O'Reilly version first, this book was relatively useless to me.If you desire a book that takes you deeper into joins and specifics, this is not the one you want. This book is only good for a very low level of understanding and you would need many more examples with other books to fully understand the sql language and using it with MySQL.As an alternative, Barnes and Nobles sells their published version of computer language and application books, I believe it is named SQL in Easy Steps, is a much better guide on the SQL language and using MySQL, but taught only through the command line unlike this book which suggests the Query Browser."
2,Poor reference book,"I found this book to be very poor as a reference. The index leaves out lots of useful words. I found it useful to read through the book to get an overview of all that MySQL can do, but using the book to refer back to concepts is a chore so I have resorted to Googling instead."
5,One stop resource for going from 0 to 100 in MySQL.,"You'll need a vague idea about databases and a concrete need to learn, but otherwise the examples and the topics are well presented and fun to work through. If you take the time to move through the book and understand each lesson, you will have a functioning knowledge of SQL by the end. A very satisfying experience. The book is extremely digestible and user friendly without insulting your intelligence. Highly recommended."
2,Cheaply-made,"I bought several of these separator key chains to split up my car key from house keys, add my flashdrive, etc. Well, after one week of use, one of the middle pieces fell off of one. The worst news was when, on another keychain, my flashdrive had fallen off before getting into the car. When I realized it and arrived back home, I noticed that it had been run over several times. Fortunately, it was titanium and was still in functional condition (though not cosmetically). I'd pay the premium for a better-made brand."
5,Did it myself and save big Money!,"The product arrived within 2 days! I was pleased with the product and the service, it fit perfectly."
2,not the worst,"I watched Hellraiser Revelations with very little expectations, my curiosity stemmed from the replacement of Doug Bradley as pinhead. they could of done worse Pinhead was very well done and the other version of pinhead in the movie was a nice touch. The general acting was typical low budget horror movie acting. At 75 minutes it wont take up alot of time out of your life and if your a fan of the series any pinhead is better than no pinhead."
1,Maybe next time,"They threw this together in a few weeks so they wouldn't lose the rights to the franchise .It's total crap,like some bad spoof made by first yr film students.It's a real shame to see the franchise like this."
4,C'mon haters!,"I found it funny how so many people jumped on the the ""hate"" band wagon before this was even released. My son and i actually enjoyed this movie. No, it doesn't have Doug Bradley, oh well. I found this Pinhead just as menacing, and that's my opinion. This movie is worth at least a watch, then form your opinion, not on who's not starring in it anymore, but the flick itself."
3,"Not horrible, worth a watch","You have to be a hellraiser fan to watch this moviemost people are going to crap on it but hey, that's how it isi went into this movie thinking wow why am i throwing away my timebut it was not as bad as i thought, i liked the second half of the film & the ending plotdidn't like the first half it kind of dragged or pinhead or the lack of hell in the movieSo it evens out & was a decent film considering how it was madewait for the price to drop until a couple bucks used then buy :)"
3,Hm...,It Could Of Use Something Else. Something More. I Don't Know It Should Be Scarier.Maybe It Will Be That Next Time... If There Is A Next Time.
1,hellraiser revalations,"i am a super die hard hellraiser fan and have read over 10 Clive Barker books and have seen every hellraiser movie. this movie is by far the crappiest hellraiser i have ever seen. i am very dissapointed. i like good and cheezy horror movies alike, i love the classics and the new gritty horror movies. this movie has no plot, no story, doesn't keep with the origanal story, the guy who plays pinhead sucks super bad and i can't beleive clive barker let this movie happen. hellraiser is too good to burst into flames like this movie. i wish someone with a good budget would save hellraiser and finish it off properly."
2,Hellish...but not in the way you'd hoped!,"I've seen some bad sequels in my time (in this series and others), but this has to be the worst so far. Imagine a high-school drama club version of ""Hellraiser,"" with understudies.DVD picture and sound quality are OK, but I can't imagine watching this again. It would make a nice tool in the Cenobite's arsenal, however."
3,What The Hell?,"I love the Hellraiser franchise, but due to issues, this is the only movie out of the nine made in which Doug Bradley does not play the character Pinhead. So sad. It's okay I suppose. I added it to my home movie library because I love the franchise. It doesn't live up to the other series though. You can tell it was just banged out to meet a contractual obligation."
1,No good can come of this.,"If you love the original Hellraisers and some of the sequels, I urge you to not waste your time with this one. I collect movies and have all the ""true"" Hellraisers. I was so stoked to hear about a remake, but then when it was mentioned that Doug Bradley wasn't coming back, I was not so happy. I gave it a chance, mainly due to the other remakes of classic horror movies, and I couldn't be more sorry I did. I watched this from start to finish hoping it would get better, yet no such luck. It wasn't even Doug Bradley's absence, the movie was just ridiculously bad. No good came from this.Now if you have never seen the original Hellraiser. SEE THAT AND NOT THIS."
1,Lovably bad,"i have a taste for the awful. I will watch the unMiSted ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" and grin at its earnest ineptitude. I love Corman's ""Fantastic Four"" movie because of how ridiculous it is.This movie taxed my ability to enjoy cheese. Having watched all of the Hellraisers in sequence, I thought my nerves were cauterized, but even in comparison to its direct-to-video predecessors this movie is amazingly terrible. I understand that they made the film in a rush with a tiny budget in order to keep the rights to the franchise, but what on earth possessed them to release it on DVD and Blu-Ray? Are they that desperate to make money off of this mess?Ahem. The first viewing was painful, but after that I've been able to laugh at it, and, believe me, there's plenty to laugh at. It's especially fun to imagine that the two families shown are the Bundys and the D'Arcys from ""Married: With Children."""
1,Stupid -- AVOID,"That's my best advice --None of these sequels stick to a cohesive plot [pardon spelling, they should have auto correct on here] --AVOID !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Watching a pile of head cheese warm up in the sun would be more entertaining,"The only thing of quality about Hellraiser: Revelations is the material Amazon used to ship it to me. This was obviously an attempt to get any pile of offal released so they did not lose the Hellraiser license.A dead goldfish would have been more convincing as Pinhead. They could not even use his voice for his character. The acting is performed with all of the talent of a cardboard box an hour after being submerged into a swimming pool. it was one step below having a Betamax player stuck on infinite loop between Buckaroo Banzai, Vibes and Battlefield Earth.I bought this simply because I already have the other 8 Hellraiser movies. But if you can avoid going OCD with a movie collection (I cannot) do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like it could give you the plague."
1,Personal Option!,"Horrible Replacing Doug Bradley, Bad Plot. Not Created By Clive Barker. Overall Option... Sucks... DO NOT BUY IT INLESS ITS USED CUZ IT AINT WORTH IT! THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE 9 MINUTES AT THE END YOU SEE THE CENOBITES! I LOVE PINHEAD AND HELL RAISER BUT F THIS MOVIE!"
1,HELLRAISER REVELATIONS,IF YOU LIKE THE HELLRAISER MOVIES -DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!IT SUCKS-ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN!
1,An amazing accomplishment.,"It's truly astouding that when you're in the same company as Hellseeker, Deader and Hellworld, you still manage to emerge victorious as the absolute worst of the lot. Hellraiser: Revelations is a truly remarkable movie that defies any sensible expectations. This movies goes beyond the incredible lows this series has reached since Inferno and almost defies physics by somehow managing to go even lower. Incredible. How do they do it?In spirit, I like the DVD cover because it looks like Pinhead is taking a dump and it's a great metaphor for the quality of the movie you're buying. The problem is that it's not actually Pinhead on the cover. Doug Bradley, unfortunately, was too busy rearranging his sock drawer the week they filmed this. When the first photo of the new Pinhead was posted online, I e-mailed it to Doug Bradley. He replied a few hours later with, simply, ""lolol.""Stick with the first two."
1,Where is Doug Bradley?,"As a collector of all the Hellrasier films I was excited to see a new chapter had come out. This movie was good till I put in the dvd player and it started. Then I was asking what the heck were they thinking here. First of all this cheap so called pinhead look alike and the actor portraying this icon was absolutly horrible in every way. Not only did the appearance look bad but,you gotta be kidding me with the voice. My 3 yr old neice can sound more evil than that. Where was Doug Bradley? He was badly needed to help this disaster out. The acting was terible, The story line was something a 5th grade child could have come up with. This film was an embarassment to the Hellrasier collection. Dont waste your money folks,its horrible. One star is too high for this one but that was as low as I could get on here."
1,Don't waste your time,"This film is grabageHellraiser - Doug Bradley = Epic Failthis is what clive barker stated about the filmIf they claim its from the mind of Clive Barker, it's a lie. It's not even from my butt-hole."
3,HMMMM.....,"I just finished watching this. Based on all the poor reviews, its taken me this long to buy...well its not that bad. It not that good because NO ONE will never replace Doug Bradley. (This actor needed to practice a lot more before making this movie)The centobites were there, the chains, the blood and guts were all thereBut the plot was watchable and is very similier to others so you can definitley relate. If you are a Hellraiser fan, pick this DVD up, (now you can get it for pennies,making it more worth it, lol) make this part of your collection. I'm glad I did."
1,depression is in the air,"I was so excited to see this movie when I first heard about even though the infamous Doug Bradley would not be in the movie, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Boy was I stupid. I was very disappointed from start to finish. The acting-terrible, the story-seemed was very shotty and well, dejavue, and the new pinhead- looked like he forgot his dentures. Please understand, I mean no disrespect to the actor playing pinhead in this horrible film. I'm sure he's a terrific actor in other films. This wasn't one of them. I understand that not all the hellraiser films were brilliant but this one didn't even seem to try to be okay. So, there you have it. It was not a good movie in the least."
2,Pseudo-Pinhead is the only reason to visit this...,like my title says...come for the Pseudo-Pinhead but leave for everything else. i'd say this is worth a purchase if you can get it for around $5.
1,Hellraiser: End of the trail,I've seen and own all the Hellraiser movies with the exception of Hellraiser: Revelations. It is by far the worst one. The bozo who plays Pinhead looks more like an ugly nailhead skinhead. Couldn't they find any pins? Maybe they should of used toothpicks. The movie has no purpose as it jumps around trying to create fear and tension and a few stupid lines. It could of been a fair horror flick if they had done away with Nailhead.
1,my favorite movie frenchise now ruined,i sort of liked this movie at first then i went onto youtube and saw all the negavity about this movie i watched this movie 5 times for free on the internet and i felt like this movie stabbed me in the back this is one of the worst movies ever made i miss doug bradley as pinhead but this movie just puts a bad taste in my mouth none of the actors or actresses had no good acting skills at all this movie is just one big epic fail at least star wars is still more orginial than this movie
2,The one and only sequel that was too bad for me to like,"Ok where do I start? I've loved every Hellraiser sequel to date, except this one. Being a college film student, I know what a very low budget student film looks like & this is it. This poor excuse for a sequel could have been made by one of my film school friends for less than $50! The plot is simple & seems to be written so that the studio could churn it out fast & cheaply. I won't even start to talk about the absence of Doug Bradley, because it's another problem entirely! If you want a good Hellraiser sequel, get a copy of a fan-film called ""No More Souls"". It's better on so many levels. I only bought this DVD because I want a complete collection. Skip this if having a complete collection of Hellraiser sequels isn't important to you."
2,Doug Bradley is the king,"I ordered Revelations because I am a huge fan of the Hellraiser movies, and I was very curious to see how the new Pinhead compares to Doug Bradley. As I suspected there is no comparison. There is only one Pinhead, and Mr. Bradley is it. The movie itself was not very original. When Pinhead first appeared and spoke, I was let down right away. If Doug Bradley can not play the part anymore, then find someone who looks and has the same type of voice as him. This is a tall order to fill, but I am sure there is someone out there that can bring Pinhead back to true form. Hellraisers 1,2, and 3 are my favorites. All are very original with Clive Barker at his best. As for the Pinhead character, Doug Bradley is the king."
1,"Let down low budget,& no Doud Bradley",Worst one i've seen really why even make the movie? bought this movie when it came out only to be let down this bad almost 20yr's later
2,Hellraiser Revelations a real dude!,"The only reason I bought this DVD was out of curiosity? I wanted to see if a different actor could actually play Pinheadas good as Doug Bradley! I was wrong to think anyone else could walk in Mr. Bradly's shoe's as Pinhead!The story and plot would have been much better with the original actor! The movie really sucked and was a complete waste ofmoney in my opinion!!! The only use for the movie is to collect dust on the shelf. For all you Hellraiser fans out there ""Don't waste your time or money On this film"" unless you like garbage lower then a B-movie!Hillery..."
1,"Not the worst movie, but the worst Pinhead","Sure Hellraiser 3 hell on earth may have been pretty horrible and cheesy in a bad way, not the good cheese. And sure they may have basically attempted to turn pinhead into a generic freddy krueger with the dream scene shit, but that movie is a masterpiece compared to revelations and at least it had Doug Bradley. This movie sports a horrible story, a horribly fat and completely different pinhead actor and was simply made to allow Dimension films to keep the rights to the franchise instead of giving it back to Clive Barker, the man who deserves to have the say on whether more Hellraiser movies should even be made. Do yourself and the true fans of the original two movies a favor, dont give dimension films any money by buying this."
3,Please! Enough already!,"Like my fellow reviewers, I can already tell that this addition to an already worn-out series is not going to be anything groundbreaking. Perhaps the make-up has improved somewhat, which is why I gave this movie 3 stars for the cover only, but still... How can you possibly want to improve on an icon like Pinhead? Why would you want to?""Hellraiser"" and ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" are in the horror movie canon. I.e., they are MUST-SEES. Anybody who does not like them cannot possibly be true fans of the genre. And while Doug Bradley's presence was somewhat of a saving grace in the subsequent sequels, one cannot help but feel a bit sad. After ""Inferno"" - which I watched because of Ashley Laurence's all-too-brief appearance - I couldn't bear to see anymore.Lamentably (no pun intended), I'll probably wind up watching ""Revelations"" anyway out of sheer curiosity if nothing else. There may be some surprises. Doubtful, but who knows?"
1,Worst Hellraiser movie ever,I haven't even this sorry excuse for a hellraiser movie yet and can already tell from reviews from other sites and the fact that doug Bradley himself didn't what to have anything to do with this movie that it is not going to be a worthy sequel to the long running hellraiser franchise. I just hope that when the remake comes out that it has doug bradley and is worthy.
2,Mediocre and stilted viedeo of the Conflict with Japan,"This video was a disssapointing rehash of the story with little detail and even less story presentation. I purchased this video and have regreted doing so. It appears to be aimed at people who know very little or nothing about the Second World War and desire only a very brief overview of a few highlights. I was excpecting more detail and better presentation of the conflict perhaps from each side, and with more attention given to the human side of the events."
4,Peace of mind,"This looks like the Fort Knox of mailboxes...However there is one craftsmanship issue. The opening mail slot does not appear to be square. One side is off by about 1/8"". I hope it will not limit what will fit. It bugs me everytime I look at it. It should have been caught before it left the factory."
2,Tough but Crude,"Heavy it is, but well-made it isn't. The box slides (with a lot of effort due to poor fit) onto a mounting plate which then attaches to it via screws which are concealed when the lower door is closed. My example, however, had been assembled with a distorted lower door hinge. The assembler then tapped one of the two securing screw holes at an angle such than when disassembled for installation, the fascia/hinge screw holes no longer lined up with the tapped holes. So out came the rat-tail file for a lengthy curbside modification to complete the install. If the post hadn't already been set in concrete, I might have sent this thing back. Then I noticed that the top mail slot door, which uses a magnetic closure, had one magnet loose and falling out. This is evidently what one gets at this price, but it is not a quality product."
5,Great Product!,"We are absolutely thrilled that we purchased this mailbox. We are particularly pleased for the following reasons: (1) It came even earlier than expected, (2) It is well made and heavy, (3) It is safe enough that we felt we could give up our post office box, (4) It is big enough to hold lots of mail, in case we were away for a while, and (5) It was as easy as everyone said to put up. Thanks for a great product!"
4,mailboss is a good design,"This box is sturdy and easy to install. However, after putting it on the old post, I realized it was too high (as the entire unit is 5 inches bigger than the old box) so I had to saw off the post and re-install. The only suggestion is to enlarge the out-going mail slot, as the NetFlix just barely fits, with one side folded up. There have been questions about it from neighbors, with their locking boxes appearing so flimsy. Very happy with this mailbox."
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!,"Now that getting an MCSE title is hot it seems that everyone and their sister is writing a book. This guy out to be shot for even trying to write this book. All he does is tell you to research the material,he doesn't explain the material he wants YOU to buy his book and then go elsewhere and spen your money researching the material. Makes sense? of course not do your self a favor if your thinking of buying this book-just give your money to charity you'll get the same results."
3,"Original, Worth Reading, but very Depressing","I enjoy Laura's standup but the book was classified as a comedy and I think I laughed only once while reading the book. Dark humor is something I'm quite found of and I'm a huge fan of movies like the Royal Tenebaums which is why I've been drawn to Laura. (Not to mention she's unnecessarily attractive) The book is depressing and even though I found her teen years interesting, it was harder to identify with her being male. I was also disappointed with Laura's ability to see life so one dimensionally, I understand she's been through a lot, but then so has everyone! I wanted to just give her a hug and so life isn't so bad, or good, its just life. I'd recommend this book to my cynical female friends who enjoy dark humor, that's about it."
2,Will I be flamed for giving a bad review?,"This book is just not funny. I tried hard to laugh, but it was just not funny. Anyway, it's a nice read.. so it doesn't deserve 1 star."
2,"Honest, enjoyable and sometimes humorous but not funny","Even though I respect Laura's standup, I'm not a fan. What drew me to this book was her honesty. I started out not liking the book at all, but her honesty and vulnerability won me over and had me rooting for her. Although humorous at times, I didn't find it crossing the line into funny. Some of the attempts at humor seemed just that, awkward attempts. I would have liked the book more if it were funnier and at times more detailed."
1,Garbage,This book is one of the worst I've read. Can't believe my friend convinced me to waste my money on this.She's honest? Right. That's what she wants you to think. Try unconvincingly cynical in the most brattiest possible way. Go spend your money on something that's actually worth it. Like Clifford the Big Red Dog.
5,The perfect book for the Emergency Room lobby...,"...No, REALLY. Because about 20 minutes after buying Laura's book I managed to slash my hand to ribbons while trying to change a burnt out florescent tube and I read it- all 173 pages- with my hand wrapped and bleeding into a t-shirt waiting for the nurse to call my name. Thank God I grabbed it on the way out the door. I've always been a fan of her stand up with it's dark and wonderfully warped humor, and while you get a fair amount of that here, you also get a lot of blunt honesty and painful moments. I'd compare it to Julia Sweeney's recent work, though maybe without quite as much cancer. Anyway, it's great and you NEED to read it. And I need a new copy. I got blood all over mine. Why do I think Laura would love that?"
5,Amazing first effort,"I can't believe this is the first prose Laura Kightlinger has had published. She is a truly gifted writer who I hope continues to find publication. It's rare that you find a book, or for that matter a TV show, movie, or magazine article that is so consistently successful on so many levels. Funny (really funny), sweet, and tragic. Oh, and funny. Not lame sit com funny, but Catherine O'Hara funny. Read it, you'll see."
3,Not bad,"This adds little to her autobiography except for mentioning her son's hemophilia and a few other tidbits. Not a bad book and I recommend though, like other reviewers, I wish there had been more discussion of Charles Edward's involvement with the Nazis or about Rupert's hemophilia."
3,Solid biography,"Somewhat dry & a bit too ""loyal"" (no shocking Royal revelations). I would have liked to have known more about Alice's feelings re: her father's early death; her brother's Germanization; her sons' hemaophilia...but that's not here. Anyway she was as reserved as Queen Mary when it came to personal life, so maybe there is nothing to discover. It's a decent biography, solidly written."
3,Not destined to be a classic.,"I'm a huge fan of Karrin and her music, but this has left me disappointed. If you are just discovering her, I'd suggest you spend your money on some of her earlier recordings, which are superb. Try ""From Paris to Rio"", ""Azure-Té"", ""I Didn't Know About You"", ""Ballads - Remembering John Coltrain"" or ""Daydream""."
3,Haven't recieved it yet!,"Having a problem with reader and haven't been able to receive this yet, but I'm sure when I do it will be great."
3,Typical Kindle Quality,"It's nice to have all of Edgar Allen Poe's work in one place at a low cost. The quality of this Kindle edition is adequate, but not great. It's difficult to find the exact story you want to read as the organization is difficult. However, the price is low enough to overlook this issue. If, like me, you want a nice addition of a complete works, this may be for you. Just don't expect that it will be perfect."
3,Edger Allan Poe,a lot of the short stories are quite boring but there is one or two that are good I'd recomend buying it for the good books. I'm still reading the book but whenever I find a good one I'll tellyou.
4,Great reading!,Handy and convenient to have all EAP stories in one place --- can pick up my Kindle and read a story whenever I have some free time.
1,Even at a dollar this is over priced.,"I love Poe, he is one of my favorite authors. But c'mon people the copyrights on his works have long since expired. You find everything here for free elsewhere on the web or heck even in your local library. You are paying a dollar to the publisher for what exactly? They ran spell check on a collection of works that had already been edited by someone else? In the print world there was a cost to print the book, but here they are just profiting from someone else's labor.I don't want to get nuked by Amazon for pointing out the alternatives here... but you can download these books elsewhere for free."
4,old stories,It's always fun to go back and read the classics .It is fun to see waht you missed the first time
5,Poe Tales,I wonder why he changed the titles of his stories? was it a language issue or was he just crazy or taking opium with Lewis Carroll and the mad hatter? any way great stories that really make you think about the 1800's and how hard it was on the common.The Raven Is my favorite story although The Man of The Crowd is second.
2,Bethani CD,"This CD skips so I am not happy with it. However, I have misplaced my paperwork and am not sure how to contact the supplier. It cost me a lot and I am not a bit happy about purchasing the CD in this manner."
5,My Pittie's Favorite!,"I agree with some of the other reviews I've read here...I finally found a toy that gives my dog hours of enjoyment and can handle her aggressive chewing. Most toys last maybe an hour for her. We owned this ball for about a year before it disappeared recently.Emma is a 50 lb lab/pit mix, not a huge dog, but an aggressive chewer. She has eaten meals out of it, rolled it around to get treats out of it, played fetch with it, caught it off a big bounce, swam after it, chewed on it, and slept next to it. : ) The toy has provided hours and hours of fun for her. That's why I'm here to buy another.After probably 6 months, the treat entry holes started to crack slightly, but they never broke off in any way. And interestingly, the cracks didn't get worse. Pretty amazing."
4,Good toy to entertain your puppy or dog.,"My pup enjoys this toy a lot. To keep it from dispensing too much of his food I put ~1"" square pieces of dog biscuit into the ball. Makes the fun last longer."
2,Lasted 30 minutes,"My beagle had a piece torn off this ball in less than 30 minutes. If the ball was made without any openings, I think it would last much longer.Avoid this if you dog tends to chew up toys, otherwise it would be a nice toy."
3,"Fun, but hardly everlasting.","Though pricey, I thought this ball was worth a try. I was also a bit hesitant as the material does not seem very durable. It is easy to fill with small kibble and treats, especially Zuke's Minis, and my dog immediately took to trying to get treats out. Unfortunately, she is a very, very strong chewer with sharp teeth (has gotten through red Kongs) and I noticed that after ten minutes, the ball was starting to have cracks in it.I am still waiting for her to rip/puncture it, but hopefully it lasts. I really, really like the idea of the toy, but again, would want something more durable.Important to note: the sizing of the toy is not very accurate. My dog is 20lbs, and the MEDIUM ball is perfect for her. The MEDIUM is just a bit larger than a standard tennis ball."
4,Makes 'Em Earn Their Treats!,I have a few Dachshunds and these balls them them active when they are indoors...particularly one of my doggies who loves to play. Buy yourself an hour of peace with these.
5,Can't Live Without This,"This has to be the best toy yet. I have a ADHD 10 month old 75 lbs puppy that get bored super easy . He LOVES this toy when I fill it up with stuff. I have used dog food, pieces of carrots and his favorite cheerios. This keeps him busy for hours and mommy can have some quite time alone. Thanks God for this great toy. When nothing is in it he still carries it around the house. LOVE THIS !!!"
2,Very poor service!,"Actually, I never even looked at it as it came too late to use for my clients' gifts. The wrong size was sent and I was promised that I would receive the correct size by a certain date. I was very dissappointed with the vendor as the second box did not come in time for me to use. I sent both back and I'm still waiting for the money to be credited back to my account."
3,Dog loves it but has difficulty,"Dog loves it...however, she usually gives up after a few minutes. It's difficult to get treats out, even for me. She's quite the chewer and hasn't destroyed it so thats a positive."
1,"Nothing ""everlasting"" about it","I have an English Pointer who is very tough on chew toys. She was able to tear a hole in the side of this ball within about 20 minutes of seeing it for the first time. While perhaps a good toy for even an average chewer, this was far less durable than ""everlasting"" may suggest."
2,"NOT ""Everlasting""","The company sent us these as replacements for the ""Everlasting Treat Ball"" (b/c our 3-yr old labs destroyed those in about half an hour). The company claimed these were more durable.... they are not. Once again, big chunks of the material (around the treat opening) were easily torn/chewed off by the dogs within minutes. The dogs seemed to enjoy them, which is the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars. We will be going back to the XL Kong Extreme (black) toys."
2,don't bother,"If your dog is a strong chewer, this is not for you. Our 10 month old lab mix made quick work of this. The first night she was able to chew a large chunk out of it."
5,Dalmatian Proof,My 9 month old Dalmatian has destroyed many toys and balls but this is the first one he is unable to do so. Highly recommended for any dog owner!
5,Keeps her occupied.,"My > 40lb dog likes her new toy. She can be pretty rough with her toys but so far, so good with this one. You have to put the kibble in the hole one by one but it entertains her far longer so it is worth it. I had concerns that lint and fuzz would get stuck to it, but none yet!Update: 2 years later it is now starting to show some splitting by the holes. In all fairness I have been putting Hill's T/D small bites in there so I'm sure that hasn't helped. This was well worth the money and I will definitely buy another when this one is KO!"
1,Piece of crap - It got chewed up in 1 day,Piece of crap - I actually returned this cause my dog disintegrated it in one day. I had blue pieces of plastic all over the house. She didn't even like the treat in the middle.
1,"This ""Large"" Ball is actually TINY","This was totally misrepresented...The description states the toy is ""4 inches in diameter"" (definition of diameter is ""The length of a straight line passing through the center of a circle and connecting two points on the circumference"") which led me to believe the main ball portion of the toy was 4 inches across. Wrong! The entire toy length is 4 inches, thus this supposed ""Large"" toy is for only tiny breeds! My Mastiff only got to sniff it, before I gave it away, as it posed a real choking hazard. The bottom line is, don't get this toy unless you have a small dog who is not too aggressive of a chewer. Actually, as it seems to be more suited to be a fun fetch toy, as it is the type that may very well get torn apart while you're gone!"
5,awesome,"Length:: 0:45 MinsHere's my dog Willis, he plays with this ball for hours just following it around and trying to dispense treats.He typically destroys these toys but this one seems to last."
2,"Great ball, but doesn't last.....","We bought this at PetSmart based on the dog trainers recommendation.....virtually indestructible....hours of fun.....yeah, our 7 month old Black Lab/Australian Shepherd mix tore it up in less than 20 minutes. I gave it two stars only because he really did like it, it just didn't last long. Not worth the money for me."
1,Definately NOT everlasting.,"I invested in this toy because of the good things I had heard. Specifically, I was hopeful because of the positive reviews from dog owners whose dogs destroy their toys quite easily. My dog is one of those destroyers. The fun ball didn't even last a half hour with her. The weak spot is the treat opening. She got to it, and tore pieces off one by one."
1,Al,The dog likes to play with the toy. It is not good for distributing treats. The dog readily found out how to shake it and all the treats would fall out.
5,everlasting ball,"My three dogs like this toy. It has held up for my doxie's teeth and my llahsa apso likes it too. We put treats in it and roll it, the dogs take off. It's a bit spendy but worth it."
5,Don't leave home without it!!!,This is the best toy ever to keep your dog busy while you are awat! I have tried almost all the treat dispenser toys out there for my Aussie and this is by far the best!! The treats do not all fall out right away so it keeps him busy! It is a soft plastic so it does not scratch floors yet is not so soft that he is able to chew it up. Plus it keeps my dog entertained for hours!!! Also it's dishwasher safe!
5,My Dog LOVES this new Toy!,"Back in the 1990's we had a Buster Cube (hard plastic cube that you load kibble). They were cube shaped, noisy and clunky for our dogs. This is a much better design. So far, our Ridgeback has not torn in to the plastic or ruined it. He can amuse himself for 10-20 minutes at a time with this and keep coming back to it for more rewards. It's quiet, it's clean (no staining of the carpeting like with a black Kong). Great price for it also. I got the medium-large size for our 76-lb. dog."
3,Found listing misleading,"Since Amazon was showing to buy the everlasting treats with the fun ball on the same page, I thought they went together. Read page carefully. There is no way to get these things in the ball! However, if you have the right kind of small treat you can put in there that won't get soggy or be too frustrating for them to try and get at, this can be a a satisfying chew toy for them. The rubber does hold up very well."
4,lots of fun,"My dog loves this toy. I stuff it full of his kibble and a few big treats and he plays with like a puppy; tossing it into the air, rolling it around. Its nice and light so it doesn't make a whole ton of noise. I don't think it would stand up to aggressive chewing, though."
4,One of my doggie-girl's fave!,"I think it really all varies on the individual dog, but mine loves this ball.It's been difficult for me to find the perfect treat dispensing toy that dispenses the right amount at the right time. Most have been too easy or too hard for my pup-girl. Although she's becoming quicker at getting the treat out of this one so I might have to find larger treats or another dispenser...I wonder how come they don't make this ball in a small size? Or if anyone knows where I can find one, please let me know? My dog is small so a smaller size would work much better for her to carry around."
5,Bouncy Fun Ball!,"I have a two and half year old Black Lab who has destroyed everything from wooden window sills to tug ropes. Tennis balls only last a matter of minutes within our household but this is a great, indestructable gift that we still use! I would greatly recommend this toy to the most destructive of dog chewers as it is durable, fun, and bouncy!"
5,"Great, durable, educational toy !","My pup's trainer recommended this toy as well as the Everlasting Treat Ball. I have used another type of treat ball to feed my puppy from, but he soon got bored with it. This one is different though and he loves it. My pup is a very destructive chewer and usually manages to tear off hunks of plastic from toys, but not this one! He loves this toy. The ONLY downside I found to this toy is the cookie inserts specifically made for it, which didn't last as long or as well as the ones made for the Everlasting Treat Ball. I fill this toy with his kibble and he happily rolls it all over the house getting to its contents. When it's empty of his food, he will bring the ball to me to fill with a treat or play catch with. He loves the squishy texture of this toy and it is easy for him to pick up and carry around in his mouth. Even after a month of chewing on it, it still looks new and he hasn't managed to tear off any part of it."
1,Disappointed,I had high hopes for this ball based on the reviews I read and the price I paid. After 2 minutes of chewing my dog pulled off a big chunk of it. Then 5 minutes later the ball was destroyed. This ball cost me more than $1.50 a minute of play. Not a very good investment. I will return to Kong products as they last the longest. Think twice before purchasing this product if your dog is a strong chewer.
3,"Lots of strengthening and stretching, but no aerobics!","This workout contains a lot of strengthening and stretching. Many of the moves were difficult for me to do, but perhaps if you are a more conditioned woman, this is what you are looking for. I am disappointed that there really aren't any aerobics on this tape (my heart rate never went up). There is a recovery section for after birth also included on this tape. I tried it out and found it practically impossible for me to do--it was so hard! But again, for a woman who is already really in shape, this tape might be what you are looking for. For a great overall workout which DOES include aerobics AND strengthening both, I highly recommend the Kathy Smith pregnancy workout. I was able to do the Kathy Smith workout the first time, and it was much more suited to my level of fitness!"
5,It's Bitchin,Taking a cappella to another level. This stuff is legit. And the artwork is really cool too.
1,I'd be careful with this book.,"This isn't the book for you if you're looking for an unbiased history of Constantine. It's very dated and Baker definitely has an agenda (there is a severe overstatement of Constantine's commitment to Christianity). This takes away from the book's impact. There are several other books and authors that I would recommend to the serious reader.This book can be useful, however, if one wants to chart how the ""science"" of history has progressed over the years. This book would not be able to be published in today's market -- it makes way too many assumptions, very rarely relies on or cites sources and does NOT do what a history should do -- provide an unbiased account of the events that took place."
1,What movie are people watching?,"I'm not sure who's fault this is, but every Magoo movie that isn't Mr Magoo(starring Leslie and co.)is getting those reviews attached to them. Right now I am looking at buying DON Quixote and sure enough, there is the review used for the live movie (again). Does anyone edit these things?"
4,Spooky Sci-fi-western,"After I had read Rider at the Gate I noticed a few things in the story that didn't add up. Like how come Danny thought that Spook wouldn't become a rogue. These questions were more than adequately answered in the sequel, Cloud's Rider. Cloud's Rider is even more terrifying than Rider at the Gate and the level of tension in the conversations, spoken or unspoken, really drives the novel forward.The description of the weather is so real that I could feel the snow around my face and my legs getting tired from walking in the snow. I eagerly anticipate the next novel in the series!"
4,itunes sucks. Instal rockbox.,"the ipod is an awesome piece of hardware in both functionality and aesthetics, but apple breaths down your neck with its itunes program and the way it controles how you use your ipod. you can install ""rockbox"" and then use the ipod how you want to. rockbox lets you crossfade tracks, change themes, and use your ipod as an external hard drive. check it out at rockbox.org. Also, you can use an automatic installer found at iPodwizard.net I wouldn't buy an ipod if I didn't plan on installing rockbox."
5,Top of the line,"This is my 4th iPod (had the 1st gen, 3rd gen, and shuffle before), and Apple has a true winner with the video iPod. I couldn't be happier! I purchased this before taking a vacation to Europe, loaded it up with movies, tv shows, and podcasts; I made so many people jealous on the flight over. Bought the Belkin battery pack so that it would keep a charge for many many hours while watching video. I also have the camera connector, which allowed me to transfer my pictures everyday to the iPod and free up my memory card. I listen to the iPod at work, in my car (avoid FM transmitters, go for a stereo with an aux port), wherever. It's truly become a part of my life.To the reviewer below, Ryan Mikel Farquhar: Apple offers an excellent 1yr warranty that comes included with the price of your iPod. Don't bash Apple because you don't know how to use it. They will replace/repair your iPod if it really does not work."
3,eh...,"I bought this to replace a stolen ipod. I couldn't afford to buy a new one and was thrilled to find one used for a good price. But as they say, you get what you pay for. The headphone jack was messed up and only plays through one earbud, I know it's the jack itself because if you twist and hold the plug just right it will play through both and I have bought 3 sets of headphones to try. I use my ipod to listen to audiobooks and with just one bud playing, it doesn't work. Also, the button is either oversensitive or doesn't work and it's very hard to get it to choose what i want it to."
2,Disappointing iPod but excellent service!,"We ordered a used iPod - it arrived quickly and was in great shape with no visible scratches on the screen or case. The seller included a charging cord and ear buds plus dozens of classic rock songs already loaded on the iPod so my son was very happy about his purchase! Unfortunately, he quickly discovered that the battery would not hold a charge. After trouble-shooting at the Apple store where we learned a $60 battery might or might not solve the problem, we opted to return the iPod to the seller. The seller, Sellman, was very accomodating - he apologized for fact that battery wasn't working, explained that the iPod batteries can fail but are difficult to diagnose (the rep at the Apple store had told us the same thing about the batteries) and agreed to refund us our purchase price. He even reimbursed us for the return postage!Though we had to return the iPod, we were very satisfied with the service Sellman provided and would buy from him again!"
3,"Unlucky, Perhaps","Since they first came out in 2001, I've bought 3 hard-drive-based iPods. Each performed well, for its day, in sound quality and ease of use. All three, however, failed mechanically just slightly beyond the warranty period. In all, I have sunk over $1,000 into iPods, with nothing to show for it today. A single buyer's experience is a tiny sample, of course, and perhaps I was just unlucky. In any event, I decided to cut my losses and bought a hard-drive-based mp3 player of different make. Thus far, after 18 months, the replacement brand has performed flawlessly."
4,"Great product, but accessories rip off customers","This is a great product (quality, design, functions..., are all great). However the battery charger is $30 (the battery charger is a necessary, if you share computer with someone else you can not charge the ipod anytime you want. How can you price a regular battery charger at $30?). The software for converting video for playing on Ipod is $30 (Ipod video only support H.264 and MPEG-4 format. Ipod video does not have video software with it, how can you rip off customers this way). A cover (to prevent scratch, Ipod is very easy to get scratch) is $30. A Universal dock is $40 (for transfer video to TV, you also need a cable to do that, $20...). I like Ipod, but I am not happy about the way they rip off customers."
1,Impossible to reset on PC,"Beware of this product. If it happens that the first computeryou connect this to is a Mac, then it is impossible to ever getit to work with a PC again - the software required to resetfactory settings does not work for this model! I do not understandhow Apple can sell such a product without any warnings. We areleft with a gift that the recipient cannot use."
3,"Furstrating for those of us who are ""technologically challenged""...","or just lazy about reading directions. Purchased for my pre-teen. She just loves it -- only real problem we have is trying to figure out how to delete songs directly from the iPod -- I don't think it can be done. Also, I think it would be pretty cool if somebody could figure out a way to just rent movies rather than having to buy them. I've also had some trouble working with iTunes; putting songs in the order we want them. All in all, though, it's a really great and fun product!"
1,Had to send iPod back because...,"my computer is too old. My iMac simply does not have enough memory left to download anything at all, from iTunes to cds. Its system would be overtaxed and it would take way, way, way to long to put anything on the iPod. So I will have to get a new computer as soon as finances allow; then I'll re-order an iPod. The Amazon representative with whom we spoke was very helpful about making a return. For that I was grateful. Chances are, when I've upgraded, I will again place an order with Amazon.Elaine Pinkerton Colemanwww.readsouthwest.com/pinkerton"
1,cost of item is ridiculous,I have resarched and found out that a U2 iPod costs about $20.00 to make. But suggested retail price is $329.00. So why does Apple inflate the charge by over 1500%??? Bad business practices.
5,WOW,"OH MY GOSH, THIS IS THE BEST MUSIC PLAYER EVER!!!!! Sure, lots of people complain about how the screen is too small, that not many people will buy it because of that, but I just bought it and it's BRILLIANT. I bought a music video from iTunes as soon as I installed it, played it on my new iPod, and the picture quality was BEAUTIFUL. Of course, if you can't buy it because it's too expensive or you simply don't like it, buy something else. There's the iPod shuffle, nano, photo, mini, the Sony PSP, and lots more. By the way, you don't HAVE to get an MP3 player. But if you absolutely need (or want) one, this is THE ONE to get."
4,perfect entertainment,I bought it before 3 months. It is one of the best units for portable entertainment.
4,i dont have one but...,"Ive read all the reviews and ive heard everything bad about the battery, i talked to my aunt and grandpa and they said its not that bad, i would definatly take their opinion over yours. They have had it for a few months and no problems. I wi;ll definatly buy a case for it though. The video battery life w/ music is a long time, but the battery life with videos is 2-3 hours when full, but unless you are going on a very long car ride, you will watxch a movie and the ride will be over, no need for music then. If you want (highly reccomended) get the dock charger you can watch while you charge. This sounds like a great investment considering i love my DELL DJ. If you have a young kid i would advise a DELL DIGITAL JUKEBOX. They are harder to break and ive had mine for 4 years and the battery is perfect, it also lasts 17 hours. The only downside: it is not a color screen. The navigation is easier too. I rate my DJ ""9.5 out of 10"""
1,VERY UNHAPPY! :( APPLE FIX THE SCRATCHING ISSUE!,"I finally got mine today and within 2 hours of playing around with it, the screen and front bezel already show many scratches!My mini never scratched and my 3rd gen 20 gig didnt show scratches like these until after months of playing. There is obviously a problem with the coating that is applied to both the lcd and front bezel. I can only imagine how bad it will look in a couple of weeks :( Beware and stay away from the ipods until apple gets there stuff together and fixes this problem!"
2,"PC virus crash looses all musc for Good,& Hooking to nother pc might erase music","I have 2 computersI lost all my music from my Ipod for Good.Let me Teach u why.Hooking your Ipod up to a nother computer may cause Ipod to erase all music because,,,,, u have to start over on a new library computer ,,,,, why because that computer dosen have eny saved music. Hook your Ipod up to that other computer its updates everthing and u looooooooose all your music,,,,,,,,FOR Good,,,,,,,,,,, if your computer Crashes and loose every thing, Im sarry theres not eny way to get it back, and it gone FOr good........ u might get a virus on you pc and wipe your whole PC out and, U have to start allllll over again,,,,,, Ipods still arent perfect yettttt"
5,great product,these ipods are great. apple has a better interface than any other type of mp3 player ive seen. highly recommended.
5,I love Apple products,"I know everyone is going for the iPod nano or shuffle for it small design and everyone avoids the iPod classic for it's big size, but I like the classic for its large memory capacity, ability to watch movies, and that it comes with the quality and reliability that we are accustomed to from Apple products.With that said I really don't think you need to go with the latest version of an apple product if you are tight on money, since older versions still work great!"
2,some problems not listed but works overall,"the ipod will pause unexpectadly and just slow up and freeze like a hard drive does out of nowhere(like when driving) and you know its dangerous to try to mess with that...so i guess it works and but it wasnt worth 70 dollars 50 at most, and if the seller sends me back 20 bucks ill give him a glowing review...i just wish that the freezing and pausing problem would have been mentioned...cmon man!"
4,30 gb ipod,Good buy. Product operated well . I would recommend it to anyone who didn't want to spend a lot of money on an ipod. Received the product in a decent amount of time. It was well packaged. Was able to track the delivery time from initial order to delivery. Overall I was satisified with the service as nd the product.
1,Poor Performance iPod Classic,"Upon receiving this item the very first thing you notice is the used ear pieces (Yuck) you can see they tried to clean them. I am not sure if the cleaning of them had anything to do with it but the ear pieces did not work either they kept cutting out like there was a wiring issue, so i went out and bought a new set XXXX Cost! The battery life on the iPod as well is atrosious, I have to literally recharge the iPod after 2 hours of use every single time even after putting the initial charge on for 8-9 hours. I requested a RMA from the refurbisher which I have sent back to them but still have not seen any credit for the item nor have I heard back from them. DO NOT BUY...SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND BUY A NEW ONE...Trust me I tried taking the easy way out and am paying the price learn from my mistake!"
1,Very Unpleased,I purchased a Apple Ipod from Brian in Hawaii and it was all scratched up and very unstatisfactory. I emailed him and wanted my money back and have not heard from him yet.
4,As described,It was as described; it came with a few scratches. The one thing i can complain about is the decreased battery life compared to my previous ipod.
1,Item received damaged,"I received the item damaged. I called the seller; Stressed Law Student, and the post office. Neither of them is taking responsibility. I end up to be the victim of the deal. I feel like being tricked"
3,shipping was fast but,My Ipod didn't come with it's cd and I the battery runs out sooner and sooner in just a few weeks after I got it. I would buy from the seller again.
5,Great i pod,I suggest everyone who is thinking about buying one to think no more and just buy one or two!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,disapointed,i got one of these a while ago and i lovedit at first but then after i had it for about a week the screen went black and i can't use it anymore.
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY,"I bought this ipod and within 20 days of careful use, keeping it with me, in caes, the screen cracked. Now, nothing works on it and apple refuses to replace it. Terrible waste of money, they don't stand by their products at all. it is a disgrace, anyone who buys this should know that they are throwing out 300 dollars."
1,Revolted bad producted,"I really don't know were to start Scratches resistant, (WRONG) software problems, the cost of repairs, incompatibilities with every other Mp3. It seems every time I hook my fifth Generation up to my computer there's going to be something wrong, or needs to be up dated. I really truly wanted to love it, it goes back to the saying don't judged a book by its cover. You would think its great when truly its not. If you don't believe me go a head and buy one and when you do, buy all the warranty's that come with it you will need at less two years so now your 300 or 400 $ turned into five or six good luck"
1,Had 2 - Hard drived failed on both loading songs.,"I wanted an iPod for years and finally bought one. I had already downloaded iTunes and burned 1700 of my favorite songs onto my laptop in AAC format, so when I bought the iPod I was all ready to load songs. Too bad the hard drive failed loading the songs. OK. Took to the Apple Genius who gave me a new one. It died too. Spent hours scanning the internet for fun tricks to try to get the stupid thing to work, but never could fix it. Never actually listened to a song on the damn thing so who knows what it sounds like. Apple did refund my money, but what do I do with the 1700 songs in AAC format? I dread loading all those songs again!"
4,Pretty nice gadget,"I've had a ton of ipods and this one is very nice, although I hardly ever use it for video. If you're just going to be listening to music, then the video option is superfluous and is like a camera option on a cellphone (best to go with a real camera or watch on your laptop)."
3,Ok,"ipod sorta dissapointed me because of its extremly low battery life. But has amazing picture quality, and can hold a ton of music!"
3,pretty good,"when i first saw the video ipod online i was DYING to get one, but it's important for you to go and look at them in the store first.this is my second ipod, my first one being a 4G mini. i bought the video primarily for more song space. the picture quality is great, even for the small screen.however, i must say that i'm very disappointed in the scratch factor. i've only had mine for about 3 days and much of the faceplate has scratches on it. i have the black model and i'm seriously considering returning it for the white model, in the hopes that it will show less scratches. i've babied mine and there still remains to be numerous scratches.any advice for returns?"
4,battery dies out too fast,only 2 hours of video time..sucks but i totally adore this ipod..its cool!!
4,AMAZING!!!,"This is one of the best ipods yet! Some of my family members have various other ipods, such as the ipod nano and the ipod mini, all of which I have used, but to get the most out of your money, a video ipod is the best idea. It has a beautiful display and is actually very compact, without being ridiculously small like the nano. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because downloading videos from the music store (itunes) can take a long time, like 25-40 minutes per show. Also, I have had trouble downloading tv show seasons completely. But, aside from that, the ipod itself is the BEST!"
3,pretty good,this item is worth the price although the volume isn't a loud as the original I already have.
3,Great iPod...weak battery life,"Pros: easy to put songs on ur iPod, slimmed down compared to the older models, comes in black!!, plays videos with video quality very good.Cons: Weak battery life! I get at most 3.5-4 hours of music and at most and hour and 15 minutes in video per charge even with my backlight setting to 2 seconds, volume about half way, and the equalizer off. (Is this happening to anyone else or is there something wrong with my iPod???? lagging is very annoying. sometimes when you wanna switch songs or get in and out of menus, it lags a few seconds.All i wonder about is how Apple comes up with with their numbers. 14 hours of battery life?? I have yet to see it. The iPod is a great music player, but it has its flaws. mainly the battery life. I am still debating whether to take mine back to the apple store. an iPod is just trendy, thats why i got mine, but there are far better mp3 players out there.(...)"
4,My Best Friend,The Apple iPod is the best electronic out in the market today. iPods are taking over the world and they continue to dominate the sales. They are a part of pop culture. Everyone should have one. The only problem that I have with this device is the battery life. If you have a lot of TV shows on your iPod u can only watch about 4 20 minute shows before your battery is on the red. But otherwise it is a magnificent player and it's quality is excellent. I never leave it alone. Alot of my friends have actually gave me the nickname Mr. iPod because I listen to it so much. The iPod is a must for anyone who truly loves music. It makes it easy for disorganized people like me to organize all of their music with iTunes. 2 thumbs way up
4,What's still old on the 5th generation ipod,"The video ipod's volume control is as old as the 1st generation, which is as primitive as the volume control on the first radio. (I'm 82 so I can still remember that first radio). On my ipod I listen to every kind of music from Bach to Wagner."
3,Apple 30 GB iPod with Video Playback White,"Ipod fans may not like what I say; many people buy into Ipod for its name & popularity and ignore its features. First you have to pay for a wall charger, FM transmitter and there is no voice recording feature. Steve Case made this product a rip-off that it is difficult to covert video files; this player only supports MPEG-4 and the easier way to get it is to buy thru the iTune shops, that is the whole purpose of the video feature; he doesn't want you to be able to view your own video files from your PC, he wants you to pay! You can convert your files but again, you have to pay extra $30 for a third-party software. And trust me, for a 2-hr long movie it would take you hours to convert. Also I don't find the iTune software easy to use, it is a pain. My friend has a Creative Zen Vision and he can simply drag & drop his songs and movies. That is why I sold my Ipod after one week. Buying into Ipod will only make one person happy and make your wallet in pain."
4,Better than I expected,"When buying this I expected the video capability to be okay. I found it to be excellent, with vibrant colors and very clear picture. You can easily convert your own videos to fit on it using one of many free converter programs available on the net.There is only 1 problem I have with it - the battery power. Watching video sucks the life out of the battery in about an hour and a half of use. That aspect of it is annoying, but its not the end of the world unless you plan on watching a full feature film on it"
4,Good catelog organizer,I have dozens of CDs that sit on the shelf because I am too lazy to rummage through them all when I want to listen to music. The iPod makes it easy. I am listening to stuff that I forgot I had. It works good on the road too (if you have an AUX jack). You can get a decent cord for about $15. I didn't give 5 stars because I think close to $300 is steep; I assume these same players will be under $100 in a few years.
1,Not Worth It,"The iPod video gets scratched so easily that it ruins the whole point of portability. I purchased my first video and it got scratched the same day by placing it gently in my silicon case. So i returned it and got a new one at a different store. I purchased a leather case for it and the screen protector on the scratched my ipod. By placing it in your pocket it will get scratched. What is the point of a mp3 player you cannot carry around with you because of the fear of getting it damaged?An ipod is a nice accesory but you do not need it and do not believe the hype. When I purchased it I felt no different than when I got it. I thought I need it because I have a 6000+ song collection, but I don't. The worse purchase I ever made, and the biggest waste of money out there. I believe it is delicate so that people worship their ipods, and think about them 24/7. I am no longer part of the ipod fad, and I beg of humanity to longer be to."
3,disappointing,"Its an ipod and so, of course, you have to love it but...I was pretty annoyed to find that in order to transfer video to it I would either need to download from itunes store or buy a separate piece of software to do conversions. For $300 this baby really needed to include that. Also, the itunes that came with this one replaced my old itunes install but doesn't recognize my pre-video 20 GB ipod. This is causing some trouble as my husband and I share a computer but each have different generations of ipods. I still love the little guy. It's thin and the color screen is great but the annoyance factor is taking its shine off mighty quick."
1,Where's the PLUG?,"I'm currently serving in Afghanistan. Alot of my buddies have IPODS and convinced me to buy one. So I did. Only then did I find realize that A BATTERY CHARGER IS NOT INCLUDED WITH THE IPOD! NO, that's considered a $30 accessory.Next time I'm in the states I guess I'll have to go to an APPLE STORE and buy and APPLE PLUG to charge the stupid thing."
2,Disappointing,"This was my first ipod and I am very disappointed. I loved it at first, but not so sure now. Had to shell out an additional $40 for an iSkin due to the fact it scratches so easily. Now the stupid thing ""freezes"" all the time and won't play at all. If I ever buy another mp3 player, it won't be an ipod."
3,Apple Ipod 30g,I am not happy with this Ipod at all. I should send it back. I keep thinking it is something I am doing wrong but I dont think so. I press the button to turn it on and it want come on. I keep pressing button until finally it comes on. It takes a while most times...
3,Works perfect but is fragile...,"Works perfect, battery life is real good and the way it shuffles the MP3 files is perfect. If your in the market for an MP3 player this is the one to get. Fast transfer from the PC.The picture quality is very good when you store your photos.The one big problem is the screen. Mine cracked from normal wear, so you need a good case. That's why I'll give it 3 stars. Too bad."
4,"Life is lean and mean, and so is this little machine","Five Words: Super great storage and soundMemory is great, cuz i backed up my hard drive with it and it doesn't mess it up. Sound is so great, i could put in my ipod into my room's surround sound system, and man do i get surround sound with just an av cable, projector, bose speakers, and of course, an ipod"
5,A MUST get for any music addict!,"I actually do own a white 30 gig iPod Video and I have to say, it is amazing! The screen resolution adds alot, and don't forget the color screen. Sounds great, as usual, and its much lighter and thinner than the previous 40 gig ipod I had. I do wish that the iPods had a longer battery life, but beggars abd be choosers! Actually i do think there is a battery attatchment out there, I just have not bought it yet. The 30 gig iPod is working for me great and i reccomend it for anyone."
5,apple 30 gb ipod with video playback black (5th generation),My 12-y-o son has never been happier. It's been the best item I've bought him. Used everyday.
4,"great product, battery life should be improved",1 Good design and good software. Easy to use but you should spend some time to figure it out.2 The battery life should be improved. It is only two hours for the video. They said they had improved the battery life in the new model and it was a good improvement.3 I have my ipod for 2 mounths and it shut down for one time. The monitor turned to black and all the button did not fuction. The ipod came back to normal after it run out of power. I hope it was only a particular case.
1,DO NOT BUY IPOD FROM AMAZON GET IT AT BEST BUY!,"I know everyone thinks that this ipod is selling for a greatprice, which it is but that will come back to haunt you. Afteryour 1 year apple limited warrenty runs out you will not be ableto return this ipod to Amazon. It would be wise for you to buythis ipod at Best Buy and get the Performance Service plan for aextra $50 dollars. Do not be cheap and purchase this ipod onAmazon thinking you are getting a hot deal withthis dicounted price. You will be very sorry for your decisionwhen something goes wrong with this ipod after the warrenty runsout. Amazon wont do anything for you and then your stuck with a$254.87 piece of junk. Also do not purchase the Amazonservice plans. Both service plans are worthless, just check outthe reviews. The Apple service plan is $52 dollars and onlylasts for another year. Best Buy gives you a better bang foryour buck for service plans. Do not purchase an ipod from Amazonyou will be frustrated and sorry in the long run."
3,question:,if i got a 30gb iPod could I hold one full-length movie (RON BURGUNDY!!!!) plus at least 20gbs of music?? thanks.
4,Its worth the Money,"I bought it a week back and so far I am very much impressed with its performance. Sound quality is by far the best. I would recommend getting a case for it to avoid scratching its delicate surface. I got a free Amazon gift card from this site and bought it using that card. If you consider yourself lucky , you can try getting one too from :(...)"
3,Good...and....bad,First of all...Id like to say...Ive had three of these ipods now...Its ridclious..Im on my third one now. Two of them just stop working or wouldnt update on the computer...They give crap on nano. Well i know alot of ppl thats had this ipod and have troubles..So my review on this ipod is not good. I wouldnt advise on soneone buying it. You will be at the apple store alot. I know i am. Well just wanted too tell ppl about the problems. I hope this helps some ppl on makin a decision of buying this or not.
2,Bad Battery? - 30gb ipod Video,"I just rcvd my new ipod about 1 week ago. Even without using the 30gb ipod for photos or video, I'm only getting about 2 - 3 hours of music time with it! It's my 1st ipod and I'm really disappointed. I chkd out the apple.com site and even DISABLED the equalizer and reduced the backlighting period to 5 seconds. I'm going to do a couple more test runs this week by charging it via my laptop for 4+ hours at a time, if I can't get more than 2 - 3 hours of music time, it's going to be returned to amazon.com ASAP. I LOVE the features of the ipod, but with this battery record, I might as well go back to my portable cd player! =("
4,Apple 30gb iPod,Like the iPod and features are great.Whish tranfering my movies were easier.cannot put movies on it.I'll need more research for this.Otherwise works great just takes a while to load everything on it.
5,Apple IPod Video,I purchased the Video IPod for my son. He is loving it and is now playing it over external speakers. And it sounds great.
2,there are better on the market,"When reviewing the ipod video i noticed that its features are nothing compared to other mp3 players on the market and if people would only shop smarter they would notice this. For example the creative vision m which is priced around the same has all the features of the ipod but has radio, longer battery life, and a better screen. Another thing i noticed is that in order to get movies and what not for the ipod u have to buy them, u cant just click and drop. Another downfall is the ease of scraching. And when it comes to its audio abilities the ipod doesnt offer many choices of formats for your audio, it doesnt even support wma format which is one of the most popular formats. so all in all i beg people not to just buy the ipod because its the only one u have seen and heard of but instead take my advice and shop around and i can promise u wont be disappointed if u do."
5,Muito bom IPOD,"Tenho este IPOD deste de 2005 e ainda o uso, ainda está bom e funcionando perfeitamente. Gosto muito dele, tenho uns 25 GB de música, o que dá quase que infinitas horas de música e a bateria dura bastante, dá para usar mais de um dia sem a necessidade de regarregá-lo (claro que no usando um dia inteiro)."
5,MY iPOD APPLE,"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS IPOD. IT CAME WHEN YOU SAID IT WOULD AND WAS IN GREAT SHAPE. MY SON IS LOVING IT AND IT WAS HIS BEST GIFT EVER. THANKS AGAIN. I WOULD RECOMMED THIS TO ANY AND ALL! THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR LOYALITY.THIS WAS A REFRUBRISHED IPOD AND I WAS HESITANT ABOUT IT AT FIRST,BUT I CAN SAY ITS GREAT! THANKS AGAIN"
5,Very nice,"iPods are very cool, they have many more features than just playing music. This one is the best choice in my opinion 30 gb can hold TONS of songs, unless you are a music adict with this baby you will be set for a while. Ipods nano look good, but they don't have much space and they don't play videos. This one is 30gb, plays video and it's worth the same price than a 8gb nano.However something weird happened to me, I ordered a white 30gb ipod from amazon. And my surprise when I opened the box, the ipod was RED. Yes, red. In the back it said that it was colorware edition, I went into the webpage of colorware and they paint ipods and notebooks, for $100. So I feel unique with my red Ipod haha."
4,battery has a short lifespan,"When I received my ipod I fully charged it and put some videos on it (which took a very long time) and watched them, by the end of one episode of a tv show (about 22 minutes) my battery was completely drained. I like the layout of my ipod it is easy to navigate from song to song and album to album, but I would not recommend watching tv shows, videos, or music videos without your charger nearby."
1,buyer beware,"I bought an ipod in feb. of 2006. In july, it broke beyond use--the screen went. I brought it in and was told that this had to be an accident and that it wasn't covered by warranty. The thing is, I only carry it in my pocket, so I'm as gentle a user as can be. This is a product that breaks while being used as designed--and costs too much in time and money for something that fragile. I've spent hours loading music into itunes, but now I don't feel that i can afford to replace the player. If you dance with it like they do in the commercials it'll break."
3,Scratches too easily,"I just bought the ipod video in black and the screen had noticeable scratches in the first week of careful use. IT SCRATCHES REALLY EASY! How come my phone and my two Palms don't have this problem? I bought a Crystal Film cover for it, a plastic film that protects it but that didn't work. It applies electrostatically and in the time I took to put it on a few crumbs of dirt and hair magnetically attached to it. Now I had big bubbles on the screen. UGH! I tried to remove the stuff to no avail, so that didn't work. I tried an Incase cover that looked very stylish but it covered the hold button and made using the click wheel more difficult. I sadly returned the ipod. I'll wait another day for an improvement on this issue."
4,Great little gadget,"I bought the iPod for my son's 18th Birthday. He has had a series of other players (varying MP3s)over the years but really wanted to try the iPod.It is quite compact, he has watched several movies on it and the sound is amazing. He has synced it with Outlook and uses it as his appointment book as well.He had it etched with his name to deter theft as he is in a rural high school and his iPod is the object of some envy. Apparently it has become a status symbol amoung teens to have an iPod.He had one significant frustration with the product and that is that his library of music he has accumulated electronically over the years in MP3 format did not load seamlessly into the iPod. It took some hours of effort to download the special software necessary to convert the music and additional time to get the software for DVD playing. Once that time investment is done, it is an amazing little tool.I do recommend a protective cover."
4,Good,"I got it coz of the brand name and big screen.The clarity of music and the display is excellent.But the price is too high as compared to other MP3s like sandisk which gives the same quality of music as well as other features like FM,voice recorder.other features are good like the games,clock,timers etc.Although I am sure how to play vedio.the kit has not information about it."
4,"Good product, but duped by Amazon","This is NOT the latest generation iPod. I feel Amazon duped me on this purchase... but I've made my bed and won't bother returning it. Buy elsewhere if you want a brighter screen, better battery life and better earphones. Amazon, you've been going down a slippery slope in terms of how you (mis)treat your customers."
4,Great iPod but battery life is bad.,"I love my new 30 gb iPod video but I got it in black and every time you touch it you put another fingerprint on it. The shiny silver back scratches easily. Mine is scratched a little bit but not too bad. I ordered a case through Amazon the same day I ordered my iPod, one week and 4 days ago, and it is still not here so I have to keep it in the thin case the iPod came with. It has worked so far but the time my iPod gets scrathed is when I have to take it out of the case to get to the clickwheel and see the screen. The iPod has a beautiful screen that you can see pictures, videos, and album artwork on. Other features are contact book, notes, an alarm clock, and a world clock. The iPod works and looks great. I love all the features and the capability to watch videos and movies. The only bad thing is the battery life. It sucks! If I just play music the battery goes down a quarter let alone watching a video. Other than that it is great."
2,Not what I expected from Apple,"My son got this for Christmas. It was okay for the most part in the beginning, but we have had several problems with the gadget. It locks up and looses it's mind like a Windows product (God Forbid :-) and it scratches if you breathe on it. I like the mini my son had much better as far as functionality. The thing has a terrible time staying in sync with Itunes. Maybe a software update in the future will solve some of the problems we are experiencing.....that sounds familiar doesn't it? LOL"
1,no good!!!,dont even think of buying this. it looks really good but after you get it youll see that it's really hard to put video in it because it only reads mpeg-4. it cant record nor does it have radio. it barely has any cool options and special things you can do with it.anyway if you buy this youll see you made a mistake.if you want an mp3 player with video than i recommend the creative zen vision:m because it rocks and beats this thing by much. you should go to the page and take a look at it. you will see that im not the only one who thinks like me.hope you enjoy and take my advise.
4,Any advice for me?,"I have never owned an IPOD (this system made me enter a rating) - but am now ready to purchase one and am trying to decide between the nano 4 GB and the video 30 GB. I will not use it for videos and photos - just music at the gym and while travelling. The nano's size is very appealing, but am worried that 4 GB may not be sufficient. Do you think the extra weight and dimensions of the video is worth it for my anticipated use - or will 4 GB suffice? Thanks."
4,close but no cigar,This is the ipod ever and I love it but apple has missed one of the most important add on the FM RADIO maybe they could put Satellite but just radio would be fine.
5,Very Satisfied,"I am very satisfied with the purchase of this ipod ;-)Shipped quickly and arrived perfectly, thank you!"
4,Great Service,"Will buy from this seller again, speedy delivery. Well done, that's what I call good customer service"
3,How do You Charge It,This doesn't come with an a/c adapter my old ipod did if anyone knows how you charge it tell me and the scroll whell is smaller what if you have large fingers.
1,Garbage,"I would have given the iPod a 0 but it won't let me. I bought my iPod a little over a year ago and it has broken twice(bad hard drive both times). If you buy an iPod I suggest you get it with an extended warranty. I would however recommend not buying an iPod at all, find another brand mp3 player it will be less expensive and probably not break as often. Oh yeah, to top it off, all of the accesories for the iPod are a rip off.UPDATE...Well it finally happened. My third and final ipod broke two weeks ago. That's 3 broken ipods in 2 years. Keep in mind that I was very careful with all three of them. So they didn't break from abuse. I have recently purchased a 30gig Zune. I will never buy another apple product after the horrible experience I've had with the ipod."
2,Creative is much better,"Yes, the Apple iPod video is nice. It has video playback(of course), can hold your whole collection of CDs, and is in the higher archy of MP3 player technology. Even though the iPod video is good, it's not as good as the Creative Zen Vision: M. The Vision: M has all the features the iPod has, but has a built-in FM radio. With the iPod, you have to buy a seperate device. Also, The Vision: M can record the radio. That's a pretty cool feature if I do say so myself. Finally, The Vision: M has twice the battery life for video. On the iPod, you can only play video for 2 hours. 2 HOURS!!!!! That's not even enough to finish a decent movie. All in all, the Creative Zen Vision: M is a much better buy. The consumer should do some research before they invest in an iPod when the Vision: M has more features and is the same price."
3,"""Good"" quality product","The IPod meets my needs, which is to play my songs. It is however scratched quite badly on the back and takes several moments to turn on in the morning. Sometimes the IPod will say that the battery is depleted, then it will turn on showing a full battery. In the morning if its cold I can't turn the IPod on at all and have to heat it up between my hands to turn on."
1,30gb ipod video,"Recieved the ipod video in a timely fashion, ipod was mentioned to be more or less, flawless. When I received it, the back is all gummed up from sticker marks it seems, and it also has an engraving of the last owner. Other than that it seems to be in working condition, hopefully, just started using it. The engraving on the back is quite displeasing though.edit: Starting using the ipod, malfunctioning and doesn't hold a charge very long."
1,Battery dies in 2 months,"The iPod battery died in two (2) months from purchase. I am very disappointed. No return, no refund - nothing. Too bad for me."
3,Good used iPod,"My iPod 30G is a good older model. Since it came with no manual or instructions and since this is my first iPod I haven't figured out some things yet, but I use it often, especially when working out. Nice sound quality."
3,Refurbished: Not so good.,"It was good for the most part, then all of a sudden the sound went on it. Now its useless and I am forced to attempt to purchase a new one. Clearly refurbished isn't the way to go."
5,"a great product, and so fun i'm gonna.......","this is such a great product, and it's worth buying over a nano, since it holds so much, and plays videos. i'm even selling my ds lite to buy songs and movies from itunes for it. it has the same quality picture as my tv does, but i recommend buying a case for it at the same time that you purchase one. as most people know ipods are fragile, and i've had to be extremely careful with mine(yes i have one)."
3,Don't get it for your own video,"If you intend on using this for your own video or for movies wait until the next gemeration iPod. Using Quicktime 7 pro to transfer a movie (One & half hours long) to my iPod took two days..yes TWO DAYS. It took me about 12 hours to transfer a thirty min show to my iPod. Sadly enough, my iPod rejected the file, saying it was the wrong format. The file's property tag states differently.If using it for music, I swear it sounds better than the last generation. However, it seems to be made a little cheaper. The first iPod I received did not work. Apple replaced it, however it took a month. The second iPod works, but it is less stable than my 3rd generation iPod and the dock interface is loss in the iPod. Also, I hate the click wheel...I don't know why they changed it."
2,iPod,Length:: 1:32 MinsSo I basically just explain the issues regarding battery life and portability being hindered as a result of LOW battery life. It would be one thing if it were clearly advertised with battery problems; but it wasn't :(
1,Bummer city.,"I hate to whine about these things, but I was sent a ""refurbished"" ipod and it was not refurbished. It showed up on its last leg and died about a week after using it twice. The apple store said it was never refurbished and said it was nothing more than an over sized paper weight. Amazon returned it no problem. Be careful, save yourself the hassle!"
1,Buying outside of Amazon is a BAD idea,"I boiught a ""new"" IPod which I found on the Amazon site and after receiving it, found it is defective. I bought it from a dealer outside of the Amazon store and now he's hassling me about a refund. His email address is cuongvo85, from the Amazon Marketplace.CAREFUL! Don't buy from this guy. He's ripping me off."
2,its not all that it was CRACKED up to be!!,"This product was cheap....90 dollars for an ipod video but it came with 3 cracks in the screen, however in the product description there was nothing about the cracks! So this person is selling cheap stuff without being fully honest of quality. Buyer be where....Possibly contract seller and ask questions about item before purchasing it."
4,Good product,"This is a good product, but it was shipped about a week late, and I was really disappointed."
1,"Bad product, I buy it because of standar, but I really don't like it.","It has limited functions to manage musicIt has deleted all my music twice, and there is no undelete function, if you go to apple web site they will say that just reload the music.For me it supposed to be like an external hard disk, but I don't see the point of having all my music loaded in my pc if I could have it on the ipod, but has a poor reliability.Frequently it get shock and don't respond to any button."
4,too much ado about nothing,I was not overly impressed with the Ipod. Cant use it as a storage device (like a thumb drive). Itunes stores songs in some messed up file fromats and data files. The device froze on me once. If I can turn back time I would have bought something different.
4,Changed my life...,"This is my first Ipod. I have had an mp3 player for a few years and was dead set on the fact that I didn't need to spend 300 dollars to play music. Well.... once my friends all started getting Ipods I got sucked in because I wanted to be in the ""cult"" too. Well I bought mine and it literally changed my life. I can't even listen to my old flash drive mp3 player anymore because the music sounds sooo bad. Before my Ipod, i would listen to my mp3 player while working out and sometimes walking to class, with my ipod I don't go anywhere without it close by. The only reason I give it a 4 is the battery life. I am not impressed with battery life while watching videos, but other than that the music quality is unbelievable."
2,Battery life is horrible for music,"I just got the ipod 30g. I had the dell digital dj 20g prior. the dell would easily go 10 hours plus on one charge listening to music and advancing songs as often as you like. I cannot even do one leg on a flight with the ipod. I get 2-3 hours per charge at best and that is trying not to touch the unit and have backlight set to 1 second. If it try to plug into my laptop in flight you cannot use while it is 'connecting' and never stops saying that even when set to manual. I always heard that ipod had battery issues but thought the newer ones solved the problem. I did look at the battery tips page and they do not help, not a good sign that they have a whole page dedicated to just that issue. Mine is likely going back. Amazing how many they sell of these with these issues.unit looks good but not practical"
1,love it.. hate it,"I bought with lots of ilussion this this Ipod, i put all my music in it and use it!! after a 5 months it stop working, it didn't charge the battery. I took it to best buy where I bought it and they told me that it has ""external damage"" and didn' repair it. I send it to Apple service and return it without services because the same reason. My Ipod didn't have that damage, it has only a few scratches on the screen. After lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it I would have to pay US$250.00 that is almost what it cost new. TERRIBLE SERVICE FROM APPLE.. SHORT LIVE.. DON'T RECOMMENDED. Now I'm looking for another option for MP3 player to buy.If you know one please let me know it."
3,I got a lemon,"I had the item for one week. I was walking down the street minding my own business, listening to some music when it crashed. I logged on to the Apple site for help - no luck. It was over. Amazon was great and sent me a new one promptly. If this one breaks then I will be finding another MP3."
3,Oh ipod!,I can't believe my ipod died within a month. Used it only for the gym & it just stopped working.
1,no,Battery life is horrible. Scratches easily. Screen is easily cracked. I honestly threw this thing away after the screen cracked. P.O.S. I realized that just didn't have to look that cool so I bought a creative labs mp3 player.
4,Decent,"Overall happy with my purchase. The original iPOD Amazon sent me the sound only came out of one ear. Ended up sending it back and got a replacement within a few days. When I was on the phone with Apple the guy said I received a ""DOA iPOD""I'm happy with it except I wish they included a charger that you could just plug into a wall to re-charge it rather than having to plug into your computer all the time for a re-charge."
5,Excelent product,"It is an excelent product, i copied my whole mp3 library (the one in my PC) to the ipod so i could delete them from the computer, but once I wanted them back, the ipod encrypts all the files i guess they make that for you not to pass them on for helping maintain the songs rights but you allways find a way, they just complicated the process.NEVER let them wet, a friend made his ipod accidentally wet and it never turned on again, YOU CANNOT send it for repair (again i think because they dont want another pieces than apple on the market, they want the exclusivity).BUT IN GENERAL IT IS A WONDERFULL GADGET"
3,"Stop being so cheap Apple, we know you're rich now.","I like my iPod. It has amazing features and the sound quality is very nice. My iPod screen is cracked a little, but it still works fine. The battery life sucks and the screen scratches easy, but I got a good case and a travel charger. But c'mon Apple I paid $300.23 and I don't get a case or a wall charger. You guys used to do that (at least the charger) when the iPod wasn't all that popular. Now you guys are making a whole lot of money, and we can't get a freakin charger or a decent case, instead we get that white crappy cloth thing. Anyway the iPod is a good device. I rather Creative Labs Mp3 players."
1,"Great functionality, terrible durability",I bought the 30 GB video Ipod when it first came out and I bought the protection plan from Best Buy and it was the best purchase of my life(not the Ipod but the protection plan). I'm now on my 4th unit and they usually last me about 4 months before they begin freezing up and the battery life is garbage! Usually I am without an MP3 player for weeks at a time because they are always fixing mine. I was told that if you jog with an Ipod DO NOT get a hard drive based player but go with the flash memory. Would have been nice to know before but the jog wheel is great and the design is awesome too. Probably wouldn't buy this product again
1,Amazon should stop misleading consumers,"Amazon sells their iPod 30GB without making it clear which generation they are selling. There are two iPod generations the 5th & 6th Generation iPod. The new generation iPod offers 60% brighter screen & almost double the video battery life from 2 hours to 3.5 hours.I'm not sure, but what I can tell is Amazon is offering a small discount for the older generation 30GB model..but they aren't even making it clear which generation is which and that is misleading to consumers.If you're looking to buy an iPod, don't think you're saving a little money by buying here at Amazon; you're just buying the older generation and that's why they offer it at a slightly discounted price!"
3,Battery Life,"One of the reasons why I have purchased the iPod was the 15 hours battery life advertised by Apple. I have followed all the instructions to the letter with regard to charging the iPod, but the maximum battery life I get from it is between 8 to 9 hours which is very disappointing. I often travel long haul across the Atlantic and my flight takes a total of 19 hours. I use my iPod to listen to music on the plane and I am already thinking of buying a Battery Pack, which means an additional $60.00, not to mention the $ 40.00 for the power adapter, $39.00 for the universal dock and the $20.00 for the A/V cable which in my opinion should have been included in the original package. My recommendations are if you can wait a little bit more dont buy this iPod and instead wait for the 6G iPod which might have better battery life and better Video integration."
4,My review,I find the product technically exceptional. The look is elegant but the problem comes in keeping it looking good because you can't keep finderprints off it. A mat type finish would be more practical.Les
3,Not a bad deal but be careful,"I had a generic 1GB mp3 player when it started to act funny so I decided to get an Ipod. The screen is awesome and that fact I can watch movies completly blows my mind. The only oversight is that the screen is still small, you have to hold it up to your face and eats up battery like nobody's business (from a 14 hr battery life, it goes to a 2hr). I actually was prepared for all the scratches I heard about so I bought an Ipod jacket from Circuit city. I DEFINIITELY recommend it, the little bugger doesnt take nicely to touches in my opinion. Plus the fact that you have to buy the charger separately really blows. But other than those gripes Im pretty happy. It still is first and foremost an MP3 player and it plays those just fine.Not mention I got it for free. So check it out: http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=25770024"
1,not good at all,"This IPod was listed as used/like new. When it was received the battery did not charge. I contacted Amazon and the vendor contacted me. I spoke to the seller and he promised me a brand new one. When I got the replacement battery it cost me $42.46 to have it installed at Tekserve. The ""brand new"" battery does not stay charged for more than 8 hours. I do not recommend this seller."
1,horrible service,"well, I purchased the ipod thinking it has everything with it. Then, it was missing the ipod USB Cable. I contacted the seller, they told me that they moved and they lost it. I tried so many different usB cables and they work for a while and stop working, such a pain and a costly after a while. I won't recommend this seller to anyone."
3,"Everything great, except the battery",Mine is still with Apple repair center because the battery only last about 4 hours with a full charge. Still wonder if I can get mine back from Apple because they said they can send me a replacement but is a refurnished. That could mean I paid $300 for a used iPod.
2,OMG!,"Arrived with previous owners library still on the Ipod, loved that it already had the skin attached, was not happy with the skin flicks on the drive, but overall in great condition, worked for a year, but is now corrupted. You get what you pay for, that's for sure."
2,My third IPOD in 18 months,"I love IPODS, but I have had to buy 3 in 18 months! They keep having problems and getting them fixed is a nightmare. I finally realized that I was going to have to shell out the money for a new one about every six months. I wish Apple had come out with a more reliable product!"
2,Cool ( It's beauty),I love it. It looks sound performs good. My kids had it now I got from my husband my 27th Anniversary surprise gift. I loved music. I put my all songs and my family picture whenever I want to listen I can listen the music and watch the video too. nice thing to have it.
1,will wait for next generation!!! iPod,Thanks to all of you who wrote reviews!. I will not invest in this latest generation of iPod. They need to improve on a number of flaws mentioned!!!
5,Great buy!,"This was priced at the same price I would've bought a 4GB iPod. It worked like new and I was very impressed, as was my daughter when she got it for Christmas."
5,Ipod Video,"Overall the Ipod Video is an amazing piece of equipment to have. It's screen is alot better in resolution and size that i ever thought and runs videos smoothly.I would though, like to mention that instead of buying quicktime PRO to convert your videos into MPEG-4 you can use free alternatives like videora ipod converter. This is just as good as quicktime PRO and is absolutely free so i urge you to get this software instead of paying 30 or however much money it is.Also if you are contemplating buying one of them i would urge you to buy a case before or right after purchasing the product. I was foolish and didnt bother buying one for a while and even though i was really careful with it, it still managed to accumulate quite a lot of scratches and blemishes.Overall this is a great buy and one that you won't regret!"
3,Darned Scratches #*^%# !!,"Can't tell how disappointed I am to see plenty of micro scratches on my iPod video! Paid $317 for the damn thing and can't stomach the scratches! Have a strategy.. will order for an aluminium-polystyrene case and then return this one. When the next piece arrives it will go right into this case.I am surprised how could an expensive product be released with such a glitch! Grow up Apple! elase let ""intel"" handle your exteriors too!By the way I was reading that the HDD is Samsung, Power management is Philips, Video chip is some other make(can't remember)... battery and display are yet another(unknown so far) so the exterior is the only stuff actually done by Apple and that's where the new ones need to improve... or is it? The wheel is too and it's superb so all apple needs to do is fix this lil problem and also give out a GOOD cover with this iPod too."
4,AWESOME!!!!,"I recently upgraded to the 30gb Ipod Video after owning the mini for a year. I was a little hesitant at first but I'm glad I did it. It's awesome. The only downside is the lack of accessories that they offer for the video ipod. But I did purchase the socks from Apple and that seems to work fine for now. I noticed people complaining about the USB, and also noticed most of them had previous models of the Ipod. I use the adapter that came with my old Ipod. It works fine and in our house we now have 3: the Mini, the Nano and the Video so it benefits all those in our home. Hopefully Apple will come out with some accessories such as the armband and a case for the Ipod. I've yet to see any scratches on mine and I was afraid of lots because of all the reviews saying that they scratch easily. Not a problem for me. I just hope it stays that way. All in all a great investment but I gave it 4 stars again due to the lack of accessories."
4,Get a Case!!!!,"Hey I got the Ipod 30 GB Black which I totally recommend to get or the New Creative Zen Vision: M , however it is so easily scratchable so you need a case like a silicone case or a leather case. If you buy from Apple they give you a flimsy pouch which could scratch your Ipod from just sitting in the case. Invest in it early and buy the protection plan."
5,Excellent piece and worth its price,"I ordered the 30 GB ipod after a lot of duscussion with my friends . When i got it i was very happy with it . I can download all my fav songs , movies and pics . The sound effects are excellent . Its been working really great so far . I would suggest everyone to go for this 30 GB ipod . You deserve one for yourself ."
3,Exploded!,"My boyfriend had this thing for like 8 years, and it worked okay. We would constantly have to reset it and it died very fast, but hey, it was old. But I was at the gym and the thing exploded! Very unfortunate!"
4,Great product and a good purchase but ...,"A very intuitive device. Functionally the device is great however, the seller said there was minor and typical wear and tear in the form of scratches on the back. Nothing was said about scratches on the screen that really don't look good."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE AN IPOD FROM HERE,"The ipod worked for less then a month than stopped working completely and unusable since, this product is junk and I would not recommend this to anyone!"
1,Feel like I was robbed.,"Bought this for a friend after his was stolen from his car. Not a fantastic price or anything, but it was the model I wanted, and my options were limited.Arrived in fair-looking condition. Not great, but it had at least been polished up a bit. Plugged it in to transfer some music onto it, and lo and behold--there was already music on the drive. It hadn't been erased from the previous owner. Clearly not a refurb at that point. But I could have even lived with that until I discovered that the battery was also bad and would not hold a charge for the length of an entire song.Seller tried to convince me that they always put songs on their iPods ""to show that they work."" Since the battery didn't work either, it was pretty obvious the only thing they had proved was that they weren't telling the truth. Told me I could return it for a refund, which I did.Still waiting on that refund."
3,low battery,The Ipod is good except that the battery is not holding very long altough I charged it all day. pretty disappointing.That is a point that you should have meantioned it!!
5,apple iod 30 gb,"product as described very well working condition, very satisfied with the purchasce of it. The product came pre loaded with multiple songs which was very helpful."
1,Broke in 13 months,Nothing else to say really. The device broke right after the warranty expired. Great while it lasted but will never trust Apple again
2,Almost a great product,"I purchased mine from Amazon about a month ago. My biggest dissapontiment was its very very short battery life even when used only for music without video. You can literally see the battery charge bars disappering every 3rd song or so. This only gets worse when if you use video at all.Some key features from the menu that I was expecting to be naturally there aren't there. It would have been nice to delete a podcasts and even music on the ipod itself after listening to it. Well, you can't do that. You would need to plug it into your PC and fire up iTune to do this. This is an annoyance.Oh, and I can't stand the headphones it came with. Extremely uncomfortable."
1,Don't buy from Apple,"My son bought this item and it broke after four months. He sent it in for repairs with no external damage, they sent it back with a couple of dents in the case. With that, they said their damage was not covered by the warranty. NEVER AGAIN WILL I PURCHASE FROM APPLE."
1,Battery Wont Charge,I've had it for a month now and the battery decided to stop charging. I've tried every troubleshooting trick I can and it just wont charge.HUGE dissapointment!The software is not very user friendly!
3,Looks good !!,"The product is good and has Nice features. But the battery life is too less, It does not even last for 1 hour.I have a old 20GB I-pod and the battery sure is real good. They have added a lot of features in i-pod but did not Improve the battery."
2,You can do better,"The hard drive on my iPod with video is shot and I didn't even drop it or anything. The Apple store said the warranty was voided because the case was scratched. So I think they are way too sensitive. Does Apple think people will buy these things and then set them on a shelf?Anyway, all ranting aside, you can get way more features, same capacity, better battery life, etc. for the same or lower price. I know iPods look cool and they are easy to use, but the product just isn't worth that much money. These days you can do so much better, especially if you have a windows PC, just do some more searching on Amazon! If you have a Mac, as I do, it might still be worth it to get an iPod because a lot of other mp3 players aren't compatible, but maybe just a Nano, unless you have money to burn. I'm done with Apple, though. Being fancy-looking just isn't enough."
1,So what??,"It plays videos, but according to the Apple website, you get two hours of video playback before your battery drains.Crash and burn."
5,It's So FetcH!!,I love it...I can watch all my favorite videos and movies...Oh my Gosh!! It's really cool...totally worth it!!
3,hmm,Well I have a 30 gig iPod photo. I do not really want a video ipod and I shall tell you why in this review. Well first of all go ahead and watch a few videos and watch your 100% battery die faster than Michael Jacksons sex appeal. Second while your sitting in a car being driven down the road go on and play a video and watch whatever food you have rise from you at a massive speed. I like keeping things apart. I mean you have 1 thine that can do the things 10 things can normally do and when it breaks your down 10 things. I think iPod is an amazing thing. The music store and being able to keep lists are all great. However I do not think iPod can be used seriously as a video player. Actually I did just buy one of these for my brother because he didn't make the high school football team so ya know I guess if I truely hated it I would not have bought it.
1,Broken Headphone Jack,"I ordered this iPod to replace one of mine that was swolen. I am aware that I purchased a used electronic, but the seller adertised the item as ENTIRELY FUNCTIONAL. On the contrary, when I recieved it, the headphone jack did not work. I had to wiggle around any headphones that I inserted into the jack in order to get a connection, and then had to hold it there in order to keep the sound flowing. The scratches and small dents I could care less about, and the system was working fine, but an iPod is not functional if you cannot hear the music you've loaded onto it. I returned it promptly."
1,just as bad a liar as craigslist,"i have found stuff in better condition on craigslist, this guy had put it under like new condition when it should have been in poor condition.Plus it wasnt just cosmetic either, the battery doesnt hold a charge longer than 4 hours"
2,disappointing,"The only reason I gave this product a two star in stead of one is because I received it one day BEFORE they estimated; however the battery doesn't work. the first couple of days it only lasted for an hour or so after plenty of time on the charger, now it only works on the charger. This is unacceptable."
5,Why did I wait to get this?,"I just got an Ipod from my wonderful girlfriend for my birthday, and had a Zen Micro prior. Why did I wait!? OMG this kicks the crap out of the Zen. The sound quality is far superior and the software and ergonomics are seemless."
1,Played 19 songs and * D * I * E * D * the FIRST day,"I am absolutely furious and have returned the product for a replacement. I bought it on Saturday around lunch. Loaded a few over 1000 songs on it. That's what? 1/7th of advertised capacity? In any case, I'd decided on this model becuase I really won't listen to 20,000 songs in one day and didn't need the extra capacity. On Sunday, I played 12 songs and it froze up, then started playing again. I thought that was odd but okay, maybe it was just the song. On the 19th song, it froze. Forevermore. I sync'd it up and was told it was corrupted and I needed to RESTORE. I hit RESTORE and it said it couldn't find the source. Okay, so I spent that much money to listen to 19 songs??? And I've been assured that I should get a service agreement because it probably will have lots of these ""frozen"" moments after the first 30 days. Not that I'm happy at all with that answer, but IT FAILS within 24 hours?"
1,Apple Ipod,"Didn't care for it - bought a Zune instead - it did more had a radio, bigger screen ... and more storage - easier to download and find music. Able to grab music and not worry about Apple's proprietary m4p format... no converting needed.Buy Zune!"
2,Not so great,"Well first of all the first one I bought died in about 5 hours. I got it replaced, only to have the next one die after 2 weeks. Is there a quality problem?A few major reasons I will never buy one again:-Very slow response time when switching songs.-Sound quality medium to POOR.-Video gets choppy at times.-BATTERY LIFE grew significantly worse every time I charged it. The day before it broke it only ran for 4 hours with a full charge! Please note: it said roughly 75 hours on the manual. Owch!-Scratches VERY easily. What is it made of tin foil? I can't beleive they would actually sell these things made of this material.-Screen scratches VERY easily. Not much else to say about it, after a week of normal I was highly disappointed.My advice, save yourself the trouble!!!"
2,stopped working,"I purchased my 30gb 5th generation ipod in December 2006. Now, less than 2 years later, it stopped working. The problem is one known by apple where an electrical short develops that prevents the ipod from playing sound except when the device or the surrounding air is very cold. Sure, I can refrigerate my ipod and get about 1 hour of playtime, or exercise in a freezer, but otherwise it is non-functional. Many people have reported online that Apple has charged them for a replacement since they are now out of the warranty period. I would hope apple could build a product that can withstand normal use for > 2 years (only used for listening in car and at home sitting in speaker dock). And if they can't they should stand behind their product instead of trying to sell you a new one!"
4,Good MP3 player,"Pros: styling,functionCons: cost, ease to connect to PC, money to spend on accessories.I'll be very happy if i can buy a 60GB with 30GB price."
1,Apple and its products suck!,Apple's products have a good finishing and great functionality built in. But Operating system kills it completely. It hangs up for no reason.
4,"so far, so good","i've only had this product for...maybe a month, and so far it has worked fine. I do think i have to reset it more than usual when i'm trying to turn it on, which i find weird. Basically, sometimes it won't turn on when i press the play button. i usually listen to it at night, and fall asleep before the playlist ends, and when i try to turn it on the next day, i have to do the 'reset' procedure. maybe i'm just not used to the little quirks of an ipod? battery life has been decent, since i use my ipod practically everyday, i do have to charge it every night or so, but i knew about battery life expectations when i was looking for an ipod. i bought a case for it, because i wanted to protect the ipod (since i use it on a regular basis). Other than these 2 things (battery and reset), the ipod has worked software-wise when i have to plug it into my computer. it has lived up to my expectations for an ipod."
5,almost perefect,"I've had my iPod now since May '06. So far it's been flawless... no problems whatsoever. The only thing I regret is not one getting sooner. Since Christmas 2005, I had gone through 3 different defective Phillips mp3 players.. btw avoid Phillips mp3s altogether. Anyway, iPods would be the perfect device if it included a radio and voice recording...and oh yeah, don't breathe on it too hard or it will scratch. Well I guess Apple has a reason for having those shortcomings.. I'm sure they're well-aware that us customers are in demand of a radio and other accessories. 4.5 stars."
5,Best Gift I've Ever Gotten,"I'm a music junky and now I'm hooked on itunes. The clarity is unbelievable and even with the worst headphones, music is presented at its best. The screen seems a little small at first, but once your eyes adjust, the display is multi-dimensional and very clear. I travel often and laptops are sometimes cumbersome. I have all of my contacts, photos, videos, tv shows and music in the palm of my hand. The unit is built strong and you dont have to pamper it. I mean if you haven't named it [ IDA ] and if you're not buying fashionably colored skins, socks and butterfly outfits for it ***smile***The battery is not too demanding for recharging. This is one product that I honestly have no complaints!!!"
3,I Pod 30GB Video,"The unit has a bit of a problem when trying to save the video clips and strange enough the unit dont come with the mains charger like the previous models so you have to depend on USB charging other then that the unit is OK, they also need to improve on their battry life."
3,"Good, but not great","Good product, but had issues. The first Ipod I received had issues with freezing up and not playing for hours. I had to send it back for a replacement. The return process was very easy and very quick, and so far the replacement has worked fabulously."
4,"Great, but needs accessories","Apple has long made wonderful products that seemed to be missing a key something. In the old days of Apple computers, they would sell you a cpu, that was only compatible with separately sold Apple disk drives, Apple monitors etc. And then there was Apple only software. They seem to be following the same marketing plan with iPods. The 30gb has enormous storage, perfectly good sound reproduction, not bad headphones. The most basic thing missing is a wall charger, and the Apple charger is 29.95, or the Apple Universal Dock, 39.95, which you have to buy if you want to use this with the remote that Apple will sell you for 29.95. And that is about the only way you can hook it up to your stereo, without returning it to your computer to charge the battery. Or you could buy the new Apple iPod stereo...."
3,Review of the Reviews,"I don't understand why people are writing ""reviews"" of a product you have most likely not seen in person much less actually purchased and used.As I write this, the iPod Video is not available for purchase, yet that has not stopped people from ""reviewing"" it here on Amazon, comparing its video screen to the PSP and other small Video devices , etc etc.It looks like most of the reviews are just die-hard fans or they hate any iPod that comes out because it doesn't have FM.I plan to purchase one in the near future, and at that time I will write a review, until then I don't see the point in any reviews of a product that is Not Available Yet!what is latin for ""reader beware""?"
4,Great Machine,This is a great product though the battery doesn't like to stay charged to long. I love it anyway.
4,Mothers & Daughters will all appreciate this book...,"Joan Rivers reveals her soft side. This is a wonderfully simple and unassuming book that reflects a mother's love and concern for her only daughter. It's obvious that she wants a better life for her daughter, and you can feel the pain that Joan experienced in her own life. A lovely gift for anyone."
1,Very Disappointing,"Usually love Joan Rivers, but this book is so superficial, actually boring and shallow. Even the graphics are below par. I suspect someone else put this together or Joan was very, very tired when she did this. Save your money."
4,Great mud mixer,If you mix a lot of mud for drywall or EIFS you probably already have this drill. One of my guys got one recently and it is quite impressive. It has a lot more torque than my old Milwaukee Magnum. The only thing I would like to see is a variable speed switch. I think it would make life with it easier.
3,non variable speed,considering the applications I use this drill for such as mud mixing and driveing heavy duty screws (tining applications) it would be just perfect if it had variable speed
4,DeWALT now makes the DW130v,"So, I see no need for this drill when the DW130v is the same price. About the same drill with variable speed, 9 amps, 0-550 rpm. Great for mixing or chasing the old lady around the house with."
4,This is a great recording of two blues rivals,"This is a great album. There is lots of energy and spunk, and it is good to hear the original masters jamming with some of the younger guys. Paul Butterfield and Eric Clapton with Hubert Sumlin and Otis Spann, and the Rolling Stones rhythm section. Muddy and the Wolf have always been rivals, and they haven't lost their competitive edge yet!"
5,blues IS king!,"muddy and the wolf. The title says it all. two of the best blues artists ever on one excellant disc. i find myself drawn more towards the muddy tracks but the wolf is great just because hes howlin wolf and he rocks. very comforting, honest music. anything on chess usually is."
2,WHY ? MISLEADING AND REDUNDANT.,"This CD brings together selections from Muddy Waters' ""Fathers and Sons"" sessions and ""Howling Wolf's London Sessions"". AT NO POINT DO MUDDY WATERS AND HOWLING WOLF APPEAR TOGETHER AS THE TITLE INDICATES. The music is wonderful, but it is readily available on the aformentioned cd's with more songs, better sound. So WHY does MCA Chess continue to make this compilation available. It must be to fool potential listeners. Muddy Watersand Howling Wolf are allways 5 Stars, but buy ""Fathers and Sons"" ""The London Howling Wolf Sessions"" instead."
4,"great stuff, especially the howlin wolf tracks","the howlin wolf tracks are all taken from the london sessions cd. my guess is that the same is true of muddy's tracks, but i don't know for sure. imho, the highlight of the whole cd is the the rehearsal for ""little red rooster"", where eric clapton et al beg for - and get - a lesson from the wolf. it might have made sense to them, but it's a mystery to me: ""you just uh, you know, then he comes in..."" of course, the music itself is outstanding."
4,Good car disc,"This is a good car CD. Obviously the original source material from the ""London Sessions"" and ""Fathers and Sons"" is where to go. I picked this one up blindly after I had both albums and was pissed at first but years later, it's served as a very good blues CD for driving. If you're down to your last few bucks and happen to see this in the store and are a casual blues fan, by all means, this is a great place to go. Legends playing with musicians who went on to become legends themselves. That's never a bad thing."
1,Gazpacho?????,What is this album? I purchased it and when I played it the vocals were in a foreign language. The album is not on the Gazpacho discography on their web site and the members of the band are completely different to the real Gazpacho!! Can anybody explain?
1,Harry Potter Parking Lot,"I ordered this for my daughter for her 9th birthday. I thought we'd watch it during her sleepover, but it was boring. She was like no way am I playing this dull thing."
4,Great set of bits.,"I was using an average set of bits do drill through steel, and was getting nowhere fast.Ordered this set, and got the project done in a couple minutes.Not sure why these bits are gold because the gold finish wears off on the first use where the drill makes contact.My other complaint is the way the bits mount in the case. The black part doesn't tilt, and the bit has to be pushed into place in 2 different ways. Otherwise it's a nice case.Great set of bits!"
5,GREAT product.,"Not a single issue with it and much, much more affordable than others I've had bid to me. I'd definitely suggest this to other small to mid size businesses."
3,Type O,I have multiple sclerosis. It was recommended that I get this book and start to pay attention wot what is recommended for my blood type. I have found this very helpful.
2,Average age of death is 61 for Blood Type A!,"Ha! The writer took a lot of ""subjects"" that were different blood types and the Type A's all died before 80, with the exception of one man that was vegetarian who lived to early 80's. What a crock! Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush are type A and almost 90 as of this writing. My dad was O Positive and died at 66 from cancer after years of smoking Camel's and heavy drinking. And this book insists that O's will make it to their 80's with little effort. JFK's father was type A and lived to his early 80's, too.However, I firmly believe in the personality section. I do believe A's to be a rather sensitive and shy people and O's with a natural bullying streak. Type B is the best one to have. Jack Nicholson and Tom Selleck are B's and I find them cool as hell!"
2,Just selling their protein powder?,"I haven't finished reading it yet, but it just seems that Personal Nutrition USA, Inc, who self-published this book, did so only to specifically sell their brand of protein shake, Personal Protein.Whether or not there's actual substance to what they're trying to prove in this book, that alone should send up some red flags..."
1,The book of anxiety,"I read this book and it caused me more anxiety than it helped me. I am a type A and very negative things are said about the A bloodtype. Like one other reviewer said, this is like a doomsday book. No way will I ever read this type of book again! I think that the author should have been a little more sensitive."
5,This is THE book for the health conscious 90's & Beyond,"Wow! This book simply blew me away! It's been months since I 1st bought it, now I refer to it Daily. VERY well written, VERY well researched. I found it not only informative but a book that's been easy to follow & refer to as it's guided me from the beginning in becoming (at last!) healthy, fit & most of all, happy with myself. I just can't tell you how this book & it's author(s) have changed my life. I'll be forever grateful. I haven't looked & felt this good in YEARS. After so many failed diets & exercise programs, I had almost given up. If you or someone you know have been trying & trying to get fit without success then Get This Book!. It's made all the difference to me."
4,Sounds too good to be true? Think again!!,"I was initially sceptical about the value of the blood type theory, however having adopted the diet and recommendations I have encountered significant health benefits - my allergies are receding, my general health and ""joie de vivre"" is noticeably improving - and I have only been doing it for a couple of months. As a B negative, I was surprised to learn that my husband is B positive and my best friend is also B negative - given that c7% of the population are B positive and only 1% B negative, this seems like quite a coincidence... or not!! Looking forward to more revelations from Weissberg, D'Adamo et al."
3,"Definitely in favor of type ""O""!","Being a type ""A"" bloodtype, I found this book to be very dooms day for type ""A"". As a matter of fact, I do not beleive that this book had anything positive to say about type ""A"". Furthermore, my husband is a type ""O"" and we have a great relationship. This book neglects to point out that the oriential population is in fact the highest population of type ""A""s in the world and happen to have a greater life span. Moreover, the research subjects for type ""A""s over type ""O""s leave a lot to be desired. Notice how most of the ""A"" subjects were heavy drinkers and smokers as opposed to the ""O"" subjects who died of ""natural causes."" Also, make note that there were a total of 5,000 people in their test group which is questionable in a world where the population grows by at least ten times that on a daily basis. Overall, I do plan on changing my eating habits but feel that the authors could have been more sensitive to ""A"" bloodtypes. I'm sure they were probably type ""O""s."
3,A Twenty Dollar Infomercial,"While I find the subject of blood type and health absolutely fascinating, I have a hard time recommending this book. I read Eat Right 4 Your Type two years ago and am a big fan. This book reiterates much of the same information but is annoyingly filled with sales pitches for their product. I did enjoy reading the statistical data regarding death rates, diseases, and population profiles by blood type. VERY interesting, particularly since I'm a type O! Still, I recommend Dr. D'adamo's book (ER4YT) over this one."
4,Dr. D'Adamo's book made clearer,"I have read the D'Adamo's book and I have been following the diet for about 2 years now [more or less] but I find this book easier to understand and with many fascinating and down to earth insights. Such as that couples seem very often to have the same blood type and so forth. I also have had several ""Oh! I get it!"" moments. Would certainly advocate buying it, even for the very knowledgeable in this subject. I found the large type a bit off putting at first, but soon got used to that."
2,Go to the horse's mouth,"Having purchased this book, based on certain reviews I read here, I wish to tell you that I found it severely wanting. First of all, an editor would have been of immeasureable value. It is so often illiterate that one must continously re-read sentences to determine what is intended, supplying your own punctuation and grammar. Some sentences are basicaly indeciferable. Also, the derivation of the blood type data is not given. Personally, I wouldn't waste my money on this book unless you are interested in information other than blood type. I would go straight to D'Adamo's books, which are comprehensive and scientific."
4,Glad I bought this book,"Happy with the purchase. The book has some typos but corrections are available. I managed to get some MP3s of the songs in the book as played in the book. That helped a lot. If you're building a reportoire you'll need a couple of books to get all the songs (better to get a book a month as opposed to a massive fake book), and this is definitely one of the books to get.At first I thought, oh my, not exactly jazz standards in the book, but when I heard the MP3s I realized what a good choice of songs they were indeed. This book also gave me one of those rare occasions in life when you discover an absolutely fantastic song you've never heard before. I'm talking about Autumn Leaves. I you-tubed it and found a singer named Eva Cassidy. Absolutely incredible rendition of a beautiful song. So now I know about about the beautiful heartfelt ballad and also the jazzed up version in this book."
4,Good arrangements,This book has many good arrangements of the classic jazz standards. The pieces aren't too hard to play but sound sophisticated.
3,"Great book, until the final chapters.","I read this book in high school. I was enthralled by the prose and beauty of the world Ms. Lee created. That is, until the end. The end of the book has stuck with me more than anything else about this book, and completely overshadows my enjoyment of the other content. The final chapters of this book create such an abrupt, disjointed conclusion that it left me wondering ""what was she thinking?"". It was as though she met her word count and decided she needed a quick way to tie it all together. It was a complete cop out and had nothing to do with the rest of the story. And now I see it's the first in a trilogy? No thanks. The illusion of wonder Tannith Lee wove was massacred by the lack of a thoughtful, believable (in context) wrap-up. Incredibly disappointing."
4,A CD filled with easy-going and engaging music,"One of the musical genres that gets slighted a lot is adult contemporary instrumental music. This CD from Lorraine Rousseau and Robert Carlton is an exceptional example of ""commercial"" (that is, accessible and radio-friendly) music done with warmth, sincerity and tons of talent. The music on It's A Mystery includes songs of various tempos and emotional moods (from cheerful to a little funky to sweetly romantic) and all of it is so well-done that to fault this recording because it's in the wrong genre (i.e. it's smooth jazz/AC) is narrow-minded in the extreme.If all smooth jazz and AC music were as good as the songs on this recording, I would hope it would be played everywhere. It's A Mystery is so much better than most of what passes for ""music"" in this genre that I have no problem recommending it highly. If you're looking for great sunny afternoon music or a CD to play for dinner guests, this is the ticket right here!"

1,Alternative medicine: an evidence-based approach: Buteyko breathing for asthma.(Pulmonary Medicine): An article from: Family Pra,"This e-book is a total waste of money. Just do a search on Google under Dr. Buteyko, and you'll find alot more info than you'll find in this e-book. I want my money back, please !"
4,A generator of fond nostalgic thoughts,"I purchased this book some time after I purchased my TRS-80 computer and it helped me have a lot of fun programming. Working through the book I rapidly went through the easier exercises; my special favorites were those where images were created using ASCII characters and the simple games. What were especially exciting were my modifications of the games to make them more interesting and challenging. It is reasonable to state that my start as a computer hacker (in the old sense of the word) began with the games that I entered and modified.Long past its' usefulness as a resource, this book has little value other than as an item of memorabilia."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"From the annoying ""merlin"" character who ""guides"" you, to the cluttered layout this is a miserable piece of software. It appears to have been thrown together at the last minute. There is no polish whatsoever."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this product. The songs were mainly nothing but instrumental. They were awful and the same person kept adding a one word phrase the entire time. Save your money.
4,An awesome book to read with caution,"This book has proven to be the link to all my previous efforts and studies. The author, Sandra Butler, does a great job decoding specific texts of the bible (btw, I have noticed she had an older more reliable bible version). Since I have spent years decipering the hebrew and aramaic word, I must say I find no flaw. However, Sandra does not keep an unbiased view in her work. She has some beliefs that I find are not affiliated with the bible and shouldn't be; afterall we are decoding the bible not writing about our beliefs. Overall, the book is awesome and a great read. It has verified the information I have uncovered and added wealth to other areas I have yet to ""decode"". I do appreciate her sharing her group's findings with the world. I hope and pray that we will adhere to the advice and wisdom that can only be found in the bible. Get this book and read it! You will not regret it! It could change your life, your outlook, and most importantly, YOU!"
5,When parents need us,"A good story about a valiant family taking the best possible care of an aging parent, the problems that arose, the decisions that had to be made, and the conflicts that come up when your parent becomes your child.As America turns gray, this is an event that will happen to most of the baby boomers."
4,This subject affects us all,"This book touches on an issue important to everyone, as we face a large section of the population entering into this phase of life. To read this book is to step into the day-to-day experience of two brave and caring women as they care for their aged father. What they face over the span of a few months are a taste of the problems, surprises and trials that we will all have to go through. As I read this book, I realized that though I'm only in my twenties I too have to look at reality and think about my grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, et cetera. I would highly recommend reading this book as a way to introduce yourself to the issue as well."
5,An Excellent and Timely Book,Although this is not an answer book for those who choose to be primary caregivers for their parents the story is filled with practical helps for the multitude of issues that can be confronted. It is a touching and encouraging story. I wish it had been written before I found myself in a similar situation in caring for an aunt.
3,CD Player did not match color!,The CD Player I received has dark grey color around the edges... not pink!.. a disappointment!
2,"""I need a magnifying glass""","This 2006 Beatles Calendar,is wonderful if you have a microscope or a magnifying glass to view the numerals, or if you want to write a reminder, forget it. You will need a pencil with a finely tuned point or a pen so finely tuned that when you try to read the reminder, you better remember because you won't be able to read it.However, there is a redemption:Photos of the Beatles!Obvious my main criticism with the Caldendar is that it's hard to find. Perhaps attach a pager so when you lose what you can't see, you will remember.I must say in 3 years of Purchasing from Amazon and I have purchased)This is the first time I was not satisfied. The fact that Amazon gives a forum to use puts them many levels above other stores. Thanks, have to go. My calendar is beeping, A malfunction unless it is looking for me,to find out what the day and month is!!!!"
3,Made the Grade: Strange Bedpersons by Jennifer Crusie,"3.5 out of 5 stars, Tess and Nick were quite a pair to read about. Especially with their different points of view and even though they wanted different things (out of each other and in life), they never really gave up on each other and stuck it through. It was a really sweet and funny novel. I'd recommended it to anyone who enjoys reading about romantic comedies. =0)Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"
3,This was hilarious!,"Why does Tess keep letting him into her life? Even she's not really sure. Yet she just keeps opening the door. As much as she tries to push him away she seems to gravitate towards him. Unfortunately, Nick's only concern is making partner in his law firm.I do believe that my favorite character in the book is Nick's secretary. It just doesn't get any better than that!It's not a very deep book but something good to read if you just want something funny that doesn't require too much thought."
4,Good light read,"Jennifer Crusie was suggested to me by a friend who loves her books as a light read. She was right, in this book, Jennifer pairs up the unlikeliest of characters...a hippie educator and an attorney wanting to move up. With friends and odd family members, a steady plot with few twists and turns,the book was good without being heavy or thought evoking. I am reading all of Ms. Crusies books and have started with her first one and have noticed her stories improving with each book. This one was perfect as a just before sleep story, and has a good happy ending."
4,4+ due to the humor :) Great quick read.,"This is a very short but well written Romance Story. The story as usual has all of the funny situations and very funny characters that Jennifer Crusie is famous for writing into her stories.Tess and Nick had dated for a while but Tess ends up becoming so fed up with his ""stiffness"" in all situations that she and he stop seeing each other. He on the other hand thought she was a bit too carefree in where she wanted to do ""certain"" things. But, when he needs a fiancé for a work assignment no one else comes to mind.While it was a quick read it was a lot of fun. If you need to kill about 3 hours on an afternoon and you want to laugh out load at some of the situations this books for you"
2,Not a New Book,"When I saw that there was a book coming in January and it was a hard copy I assumed that it was a new book. After reading the first chapter I realized that was not correct. I had actually read this book before and I read it in paper back. The really sad part is that there are many Jennifer Crusie books that I would not mind re-reading but this is not one of them. There were some funny moments-The dinner table with the parents was pretty funny, but for the most part nothing much happens and the characters very old fashion. Next time I will make sure to check the publish date so I won't get taken again."
3,Hmm....,"I usually don't rate Crusie's book this low, but I had a problem with some of the characters. For starters I didn't like Gina's pitiful attitude. She had such low self-esteem I couldn't help but feel like that took the oomph out of the plot. I'm not sure how Park could put up with her; she would judge herself so harshly everytime she did something dumb out of nervousness. Instead of sympathizing with her I felt mad! She was ridiculous! Tess on the other hand was over the top! The only character I loved was Nick, he was described like the perfect man! I always love it when men give into capricious women, and he would do it wonderfully."
3,Still Good,"This wasn't one of my favorite books by Ms. Crusie. It is good so please do read it but there seemed to be something missing from this one. The characters interacted well, and the scenes were believeable but I didn't get the connection with the characters as I have with her previous books. Still a good read I would recommend it."
2,Not her best work!,"I am a confirmed JC fan, but this is not the book I would pick up if I had not already read several of her other greats: Crazy for You, Welcome to Temptation, Faking It, Bet Me. O. K. I know this is an earlier work, but I did not like Tess and Nick, the chemistry was not there (for chemistry, check out Bet Me!!!) I started to like the secondary characters Gina and Park (Park's mother was a hoot) better than uptight Tess and boring Nick.I gave this book two stars because I will always be a devoted Crusie fan!"
2,Don't Bother!,"If you are a Harlequin romance lover, this might be your cup of tea. If you're a newer fan of Crusie's like me and enjoy a little bit of comedic romance...I wouldn't bother!This book was ok. But it was pretty much a short, formula romance novel from back in the early 90's when Fabio was all the rage....I've read several of Crusie's older novels and after this one have decided not to waste my time. I MUCH prefer books like Bet Me or Welcome to Temptation!!"
2,Not Sure About This One..,"Perhaps this book would appeal more to people who have experienced the sixties and the changes that happened since then to life in the USA. I like the idea of the book; it tells the story of 2 people, one a proper rich Republican, the other a feminist politically correct Democrate, how they interact, how they think, how they fall in love. The idea is not bad, but the book is not very enjoyable. A few good laughs, espcially the dinner scene, a few good lines now and then is all I got out of this book. This is my second book for Crusie. Try reading Fast Women; it is a lot more fun."
3,Cindertess meets Prince Nick - a classic,"This was nice short story (249 pages) of fun, great sex and intense rich people. This is like a sampler to the great books that Jennifer Cruise wrote later in her career. I would pick-up this book and all of Cruise's books and just enjoy."
2,Typical Romance Fiction,"As an undyingly loyal fan of Jennifer Crusie, I was thrilled and delighted to find a title on the bookshelves with her name. I have read just about everything she has written and I have always found her dialogue to be witty and clever. Her books are not usually of the cookie cutter variety. Strange Bedpersons was written in 1994 and I think it was before she became such a popular author. It's cute, but predictable. I felt a lack of depth found in her other novels. I've come to the conclusion that she has improved with experience. If you have a passion for Jennifer Cruisie, read it and enjoy, but don't expect her usual top quality romance."
4,Good for a beginning gardener!,"This book is great for the beginning gardener, but lacked some information, such as average yield for each item the first year and subsequent years. But it was a great intro to fruit, vegetable, & herb gardening!"
1,Great for non-professionals or students,"I am a professional Hairdresser at a reputable Day Spa in Northern California. I have used many brands of shears ranging in cost from $70 to $1200. Although I have heard the saying ""you get what you pay for"", I figured that I would give these shears a try to keep on hand as a spare. I really should have listened to that old rule of thumb. The shears I am sure would be quite suitable for students or non -professional household use, but arent salon quality. I guess I will know better for my next purchase, and stick to Beauty shows and known sellers before I outsource to Amazon or private sellers.Just a heads up to future buyers, I could be incorrect, but I dont believe that this seller accepts returns. I will check into it however."
5,Excellent text for Chemical and Industrial engineers!,"This book is a winner . Through every chapter you ' ll learn all the aspects involved with the several techniques employed commonly in Engineering .The solved problems of mass balance , the concepts related with energy balance and the clear methods make impossible for any student to fail . The graphics are very well illustrated and conceptually concise .Since I've been in the industry field this book has been a great support and a must referenceThe chapter related with Caloric Capacity is one the best . This book wil help you in Chemical Engineering Principles , Unit Operations , Transport Phenomens and even Thermodynamics .The ratio quality / prize , justifies by far your acquiring process."
4,Awesome!,I really enjoyed reading the book. I'm a Christian so I can really relate to the Biblical principles in the book. The book was well-written and inspiring. Keep up the good work!
5,Judith Pella knows how to write a great series,This is yet another great book in the series. I've been reading all of them this past month...:-)
4,Enjoy this series,"I am reading the entire series. I like to follow the historical aspect of this series, and this book, as do the others, gives me the information in an interesting way. I am enjoying the entire series."
5,Another great one,Pella and Phillips never seem to disappoint with this series. I recommend all seven books with five stars.
5,Webkinz,You can't go wrong buying a webkinz and they have so many different animals to chose from. Not only it is a soft stuffed animal but with the tag on the animal the child can go online and create an online version of their stuffed toy. So they can play both with the toy and play online with their new pet as well.
5,A modern fairy tale for adults,"At first glance I thought that Buffalo Gals, Won't You Come Out Tonight was a children's book, but flipping through I was soon corrected. Though set in a fairy tale format, it is definitely a story for adults (and older children as well) and is a beautifully written Ursula LeGuin classic. I read the book in one go, not a hard feat considering it's a short read, but every line and page is masterfully done and I could have hardly put the book down if I had wanted to - the story pulls you in and fascinates. The illustrations are also very inspired and go perfectly hand-in-hand with the story - a wonderfully synergistic combination. A must read for every Ursula LeGuin fan."
5,"I said, ""Yes""!","I read a book called ""Everybody Else's Parents said Yes"". It was a great book!It had many fresh,new ideas. It's about a boy in his sixth grade year and his adventures with the girls of G.E.T. H.I.M., and the tormenting of his older sister Amanda. It also involves a fight between Matthew and his mother over junkfood vs. health food. This was an all-around five star book. I would recommend this book to people of all ages! --MS"
2,Buyer beware- over priced- not as described,This set is extremely overpriced- quality and workmanship are very poor for the price you pay- you are better off spending $20 and getting the badmitten net.... It took forever to interpret the instructions- - I am very disappointed by this item.....
3,Some good ideas and photos but a bit too autobiographical.,"Yes, this book does contain many useful items of information concerning the behavior, care and grooming of ""Aussies."" There are also numerous high quality photos of various champion show dogs. However,the book struck me more as an autobiography of the author, Nell Fox, than as a dedicated and comprehensive guide to the breed. I would suggest purchasing the book but only with the knowledge that much of it serves to sing in praise of the author herself! However,with that said; for those who are especially interested in the history of the breed and in Nell Fox's key role in bringing Aussies to America, this book is a must read."
3,No customer service!,"Watch was fine except it was too small. Contacted seller about adding links to the band. ""They don't do that"". Have waited since 11/23,2007 for a refund and have not received it. I will file a claim. I have confirmation on the watch being returned."
5,Great Book,"It's an eye opener, and no it's not just you, there are many people it's happening to, so read on."
3,Youth Soccer Coach,"This volume has some nice concepts to improve soccer tactics, but is nothing spectacular. A rather light read, containing limited examples of the various general tactics discussed. Many of the drills presented are contained in other books which offer more indepth discussion."
3,Functional.,"This caliper is heavy, sturdy, and attractive. The only problem I have is that the measurement markings are offset from the edge, and require the user to read the measurement at an engraved line- which can be difficult to see at some angles and distances. Other, similar calipers I've used are easier to read."
1,Others are better,"Two problems are associated with the reference marks that are on the body of the calipers. First, they are difficult to ""read"" because they are inscribed so lightly, and second, their zeroes conflict. That is, when the calipers are closed the mm reading is not zero - it is in fact 1/2 mm off.Another problem is the instruction to wash hands after every use. The ideal caliper would be made of a safe material and be accurately and easily read without a magnifier. See my other reviews for a suggestion."
3,Not very informative,"This book has well-written descriptions of the scenery, but it really doesn't have any planning information that you couldn't find from the internet. It is helpful if you want to know which turnoff points to take for certain views."
3,Extremely Basic,"This is an OK book for a very broad overview of Yosemite, but is not very useful for specific information or recommendations.It has a lot of general information, so might be good if you are in the extreme early stages of planning your trip, but is not very useful once you get there. For example, there is lots of listings of different accomadations at each of the park entrances, but that is of minimal help if you already have your hotel booked. There is very little information on hikes and sites to see, but there are many other better sources for that type of information."
1,Spice labels,"These labels were totally useless to me. They only had several spices that I actually use, most were not. So for $4.00 plus,I believe, $12.00 in shipping I got 25 little cicles with spice names on them. What a rip off!! The company said I could return them but not get the shipping refunded. It just was not worth the trouble. I am pissed !!"
4,Lots of fun,"Oh, wow. There are some terrible reviews for this book, but I really enjoyed it! I liked the taste of other countries and the friendships that developed. I guess I can picture myself in her shoes. Many people don't like Tansy (the main character), I assume because she's crabby? I love characters like that, though. She says what she thinks and is fallible. And, she comes out of it gradually. Give this book a try.My only complaint is that I felt it could've been much longer! Sometimes the jumps in time left me feeling cheated, because I wanted more of it all."
5,Such a great book,"When i picked up this book I didn't really think about how great it would be. While reading Backpack, it made me think about going backpacking through Asia myself. Emily Barr really brings you through Asia, you get that feeling that you're backpacking through Asia."
1,Dreadful,"The most unbelievable thing about this book (even more incredulous than the plot)is the fact it was ever published! The novel's title and sub-title are horrendous, the murder element of the story is really badly laid-out and the psychological element is WAY out of the author's depth. It's like a 'best in class' secondary school essay. Very disappointing too that we are left with absolutely no feel, no atmosphere, of the wonderful places visited. It's almost criminal."
1,Backpack - Did anyone edit?,There is a typo in the very first sentence of the book. This is just a small foreshadowing of the rest of it. Did anyone proof read?
2,NO Bridget Jones,"I purchased this book with the impression that this would be a romantic comedy.After reading the first pages, I quickly realized that, in my opinion, I would certainly not qualify this as a comedy.The writing was heavy and I just did not care for it at all."
2,Really Lacking ......,"I was disappointed with ""Backpack"" by Emily Barr. I thought the premise sounded interesting and it might be a nice departure from the sickeningly ""sweet"" world of ""CHICK-LIT"" but, I was left hating the main character and not really caring about the plot. I'll confess --- I gave up before I was finished. Was hoping for more."
1,pack and leave,"Unless you have nothing else to do (and that includes nothing else ro read), leave this one on the shelf.This story about a young girl who decides to leave everything and discover the east as well as herself, falls short in every aspect. The plot is not interesting and the e-mails , althought original, are not enough to lift up the storyline. What was for me the biggest drawback of this book is the shallow characters and the abnoctious hero who is simply impossible to relate to in any way.As a non native english speaker i finished this book for the sole purpose of improving my english. There are so many good books out there it is simply not worth the time."
3,For those with the travel bug,"Tansy takes off on her adventure with no idea where she will end up or the people she will meet along the way. Great read for anyone who loves to travel! I felt like I was right there with her along the way. Must throw in a slight heads up about drug use and language, but appropriate for the style of the book."
2,"Contrived ending, obvious burnout of author",If you like reading about bratty over-privileged girls then this book is for you. The ending was a complete cop-out. It disguised the fact that the author Emily Barr was suffering from burn-out. I won't put the spoiler in this review; let's just say that it was an all-too convenient way to wrap things up.
3,Good read,"As another reviewer said, this isn't the typical chick book. I liked the twist at the end. I didn't see it coming. I didn't really get a sense of all of the places Tansy went to. I was more interested in her love debacle."
1,A huge disappointment,"I picked up this book thinking it would be a fun sassy read but it turned out to be annoying and nearly unreadable. The main character is a whiny drug addicted twenty-something more interested in her designer clothes and where her next coke score is coming from than anything else.The first five chapters are mostly a rehash of her failed relationships (I wonder why, all she does is whine about everyone she knows!) after she wakes up in the hospital after overdosing and her decision to travel to Asia for a year. The Asia chapters seem like the author showing off how much (or how little, at times) she knows about SE Asia because she visited once.The story line and main character might be bearable if the writing didn't make this such a rough read. There is constant switching between past and present tense. The clever use of emails isn't really clever at all. I ended up skimming to the end."
2,Do Not Like New Animation,"I do not like the new animation. It has caused the series to lose much of its charm. It now looks slick, harsh, computer-generated. The characters are not the same. I was very disappointed!"
4,Keep the part going!,"I enjoyed this DVD installment much more than the last one, even though I don't really care much for the change they made to Bitzer (new season?). But I did enjoy the addition of the cat (Pidsley?) And the Doctor Who (Dalek) gag in the birthday party episode was just classic (can't...climb..stairs)! Sure, most kids won""t get it, but that's part of the appeal about this series -- the whole family will enjoy it. My only gripe is that these DVD installments aren't long enough."
1,Shaun became malicious jerk! This is SO not funny.,"We have loved all of the past Shaun the Sheep DVDs. On all of the past disks, Shaun is funny, and works with the other sheep and Bitzer to fool the farmer in hilarious ways. On this disk, Shaun is malicious and not at all funny. There is a nasty cat as well who makes it even worse. I was severely disappointed, and my nine-year-old was furious. Aardman has made a serious mistake in the direction of their show."
4,Not quite as good as other Shaun Adventures,"We are big fans of Shaun the Sheep in my family and have a full collection of stories, so I was excited to see a new release. Overall, the stories are still cute and funny, but the characters have a different look to them, which we have a bit of a hard time getting used to."
1,Awful,"This book was awful! I would say 90% of the book is inner monologue of the 2 MC's. Instead of having actual conversations, the author writes of how they talked about this and that, and they are thinking this and that, and plan to do this and that. The only remotely humorous thing in this book was the birds. I did not find any of the characters likeable. I had to force myself to actually finish this book."
4,Lots of great information but not quite complete.,"I purchased this book to brush up on speed training and the latest techniques so I could train my son and some soccer teamates. I have done speed training myself years ago and was familiar with the methods. This book cuts out the fluff and tells you exactly what to do and why. The author does a good job of explaining how to apply the training to younger athletes and at what age each technique is appropriate. The step by step training course outlined is terrific. My only complaint is that not enough emphasis is put on sprintng technique/posture and how to improve it. My experience has been that poor technique/posture is often the biggest problem for young athletes and luckily I already knew quite a bit about technique. A few more photos and details on proper sprinting technique would really help. Overall, the book is very good and we are achieving great results using the workouts."
1,Value,"The book is very simple and tertiary. Lightly discusses a number of topics. Details related to form and execution are lacking for someone who claims to have their Doctorate. The illustration is worse than what I can create on my home computer. The real issue I have is that the author and the publisher are both deceptive in their practices. Although the book appears to be a significant volume...in fact, it is triple spaced text with 20-26 font all to increase the number of pages to appear as if the book is a significant volume. In addition, the basics for any book such as an Index are missing entirely. This book is a joke even if it was priced at $3-$4 it would not be worth the shipping & handling."
4,The boss and the Plain Jayne Bride,I just found out about Heather MacAllister through my local bookstore and just love her writting. She made the characters seem so real and not to mushy. The people in this book where a joy to discover and a sorrow to see it end.
1,WARNING,"This product is truly something to be wary of. When I had a problem with a corrupt image, the customer service gent wanted me to debug the issue myself. When I explained I was uncomfortable with it, and would rather return the product than debug it myself, I received no less than 3 insulting e-mails including, ""Are you a failure in life?"" and ""as I said...buy [he included another product name here]"".This is the worst customer support I have ever seen and am still stuck with a non-working program. Please, before you consider this product, realize what you may be getting yourself into.By the way, I did take their advice...the other product is in the mail."
3,Wright Brothers,This was a good book with loads of information. I especially like how each page has a new topic. This way all of the information is very well organized and easy to find. Also the pictures were great and helps the children get a better understanding of what the fist plane actually looked like.
5,best environmental songs ever,THIS PRETTY PLANET is the best set of environmental songs I have ever heard and read (lyrics). There are songs for all ages and even those for kids are fun for adults. The major theme of good stewardship is excellent and inspiring. The recycling song is wonderful and kids also dig good garbage. The lyrics are clever. The vocals are great. And the instrumental arrangements are varied and excellent. I write this as a professional ecologist and educator of K-seniors.
2,Not his best,"We really enjoyed Tom's Moonboat CD, so I purchased a couple more for the kids (2 and 5 yrs) for Christmas. I was very disappointed in the content of this CD. We listened to a little more than half before the kids and I lost interest and turned it off. Every song is about ""Green"" subjects, which gets old after the 2nd song. The songs are not as creative and playful as his other work. We also bought the Family Tree CD, which is wonderful, and contains a better version of the ""Pretty Planet"" song. I recommend purchasing Family Tree or Moonboat over this CD, unless you're a teacher looking for music about environmental issues."
2,Too light for real exertion.,"As a male, I exercise to sweat, burn calories and strengthen up. I chose this yoga program to supplement myself and focus on flexibility.The holds are too short to really even get a stretch. It's mainly a bunch of poses and although this may benefit those that are just starting back into exercise, I hardly felt that there was any exertion involved.Denise Austin built her name on aerobics. I'm not sure if she's really ""into"" Yoga; however, it is the fad of the decade isn't it.Despite my criticism, this program would be appropriate for beginner's / those that need to just start moving. It's a step in the right direction.For those that are even modestly fit, I would recommend skipping this one."
3,This was the best of the group.,The work out had my heart rate up. The routine is easy to follow. I prefer instruction with more emphasis on the breath.
4,Beginner to Yoga,"Two days ago was my first attempt at Yoga. Not wanting to join a class and have everyone know I have zero experience, I decided to look for one on Amazon Prime-Instant Video. So glad I did. Now I can build my confidence and strength a bit before I join a class. Thanks Amazon for adding this in your collection so I can build my repertoire!"
4,Well-paced yoga,"A good pace for all levels. I was surprised by but still enjoyed the second workout, which required weights. Both workouts definitely gave me a nice burn."
1,Terrible!,"If you are at all familiar with yoga, you will not enjoy this workout. BThe poses are not completely accurate, the sequencing is bad and there is no flow."
3,Ok,"This is probably a great video for a yoga beginner. I was a bit disappointed in the DVD for a few reasons. I do love Denise and will continue using her, but this DVD will be used for days when I just need a little stretch.The first 30 mins is mostly stretches. She does offer different levels of progression but they are basic poses. The poses arn't held for very long. I didn't get much out of the lunge series. Overall, a great stretch.The second 30 mins is taking traditional yoga poses and adding weights. A bit more challenging, but not difficult if you practice yoga.Overall, a good basic yoga practice but not as challenging as I thought. Her Yoga Body Burn is more difficult due to the vinyasas and her Fat Burning Yoga is also more difficult due to the continuous movement in the first 30 mins. This one compares with the yoga section in her Power Yoga DVD. Simple, basic flowing movements with brief holds. This video is NOT for ""feeling the burn""."
2,Not yoga,"I was expecting yoga, just more intense. The movements/poses do not flow at all - there is jumping & swinging involved. The workout was not not intense enough to provide a ""hot body"" or mindful enough to call it yoga."
4,Stick with it,"I normally go to a yoga studio but thought I would give this a try. I only did the first half, about half an hour of actual yoga. Toward the end I got up a bit of a sweat, which I like, and she does very good stretching poses. I feel very stretched out and am sure I will feel it tomorrow! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because she really builds up and takes you too deep too quickly, in my opinion. For a beginner that doesn't understand proper form, this would be a way to possible get hurt or go too far and lack the form. It is always better do do a little less with the right form. The poses also don't flow very well, so it is like half an hour of yoga stretches versus true vinyasa flow. I do plan on doing it again."
4,Not a yoga fan but...,Well of all the yoga workouts I have I think I like this one the best. I did the yoga fit workout and she does a lot of moves but does not keep you in them forever! She doesn't over do moves or body parts. Since I'm not a fan of yoga this one moves nicely from one move to the next without too much pain! I'll keep doing yoga because I know its good for me! She is adorable and easy to follow!
4,Pleasantly surprised by the information,I was pleasantly surprised by the information presented in the book. I purchased it for a quick reference. I quickly found myself reading page after page learning quite a bit about herbal remedies. I would recommend it to any one who is interested in healthy alternatives in addition to medications.
4,Like,"This was a lighting deal and worth all I paid for it. Our grandchildren enjoy it when they come to the house. Our granddaughter more than the grandsons. The dry erase is a little hard to clean off for them, so I have to put ""elbow grease"" in order to keep it looking good."
4,Great for the imagination,"This toy is fun for the creative minds, and it comes with plenty of good stuff. My daughter loves to ring the bell and say,""school time mommy, school time."" Too cute. The only thing I don't like is the dry erase board doesn't stay put, and it doesn't come with dry erase markers. But the crayons work good, you can scrub it of somewhat. I really like the detachable clock, beacause she is learning how to tell time at 4 years old."
5,Playing School,My 4 year old granddaughter wants to play school every day! She loves it! I really like how she is already learning the states and uses the pointer to point them out!
4,Pretend school,"My 4 year old LOVES to play with this, it has all the stuff for pretend school. Her interest has lasted much longer than most of her toys. I recommend it for sure!"
4,Pretend and Play School Set,"This toy was bought for my 6 yr old granddaughter. She immediately after opening began to setup and play with the toy. She loved the pointer and the bell and the map of the United States of America. She was so excited about the toy that she helped me write this review. The fold up case is convenient and easy for her to carry and store. The durability could be better, but it is alright for a child that is not to rough on toys. The minimum age for the product is a little low since younger children that are not in school will not understand the material and purpose of the toy. Since my granddaughter is in school, she can relate to the toy very well. She likes being in charge and making up instructions. There were no dry erase markers but I read other reviews and ordered some along with the toy so that she would have some. All in all I think this was a good purchase if not only because she actually plays with it."
4,Little Teacher,Stores conveniently. Easy for child to put away. Cleans nicely. It looks like fun!Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun!She likes it a lot!
4,Little School Marm loves it!,"My 7-year-old granddaughter requested this gift after seeing it online. I had purchased a similar product from another source previously which I thought was far superior, but it also had a big price tag. She was thrilled with this and although it seems kind of flimsy, who am I to say what's great or not? I'd say the kid should be the judge. She is especially thrilled with the pointer that comes with this set. She is a 1st grader and has been holding ""classes"" with her student sibling and cousins throughout the Christmas vacation."
4,Cute set for your little teacher...,"This is a cute set for a child who loves to play school. My daughter is 6 and I would say it's perfect for her age group. She loves the bell and the pointer. You could easily add your own worksheets or teacher stuff to it. I like that it is compact, all cleans up neatly into itself. It has a dry erase area to write on but does not include a marker."
2,"Good idea, but not worth the price","Great colors and concept, but too advanced for 4-5 year olds and too young for grade schoolers. The areas to write on were far too small and could not hold up vertically when used. The wipe-off markers were missing in the set I purchased which was disappointing as well. I would have done better with the purchase of a blackboard."
5,Daughter Loves It!,"My 8 year old daughter loves to play school with her 6 year old sister. She ordered this after Christmas, and it is her favorite gift."
5,Pretend and Play School Set,I purchased this for my 8 year old granddaughter who absolutely loved it. She loves to play school teacher and this was the ideal gift. The product states for age 3+ but I think it should state for maybe 3 to 10 years of age as it really seems geared more to a child older than three.
5,Pretend and play school set,"I ordered this as a xmas gift 2 years ago. My daughters are still playing with it now! If your children like to play school, they will truly enjoy this."
5,excellent play school set,My daughter really wanted this for Christmas. She really has played and played with it ever since. I wish that it came with some dry erase markers for the board in it but other than that we have been very pleased with the product.
4,Well Worth the money,"Very cute set. My daughter loves it. She has trashed a lot of it, but that is just her. It has given many many hours of fun and we haved used the little maps quite a lot."
5,Still going after a year,"I bought this for my six year old for Christmas last year and she still plays with it several times a week. The pieces end up everywhere but it's all part of the ""classroom experience"" she's created. Definitely a thumbs up!"
5,excellent fun learning toy,My daughter just entered kindergarden last year.this toy let's her pretend she is the teacher.absolutely loves it!!! Keeps her entertained for hours.Big plus......any child entered into pre school or K tis is an excellent tool and toy.has everything child can to relate with school................
5,Granddaughter loves this,Gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas gift and she and my other granddaughters love playing school. I feel that it is of good quality
5,play school set,"I am a teacher, so my little girl likes to play teacher too. This is a wonderful product to allow her to do this at home. I wish I has the pointing finger in my classroom!"
3,School is FUN!,"Mommy & daddy gave this to our Kindergartener this year for Christmas and she was so excited! She loves everything in but was wondering where the dry eraser marker was. I thought this was odd myself as it carries everything else needed (dry eraser board, dry eraser but no dry eraser marker!)for this activity. I think she would play with it more if she were by herself as her bigger sister tends to want to take over! I'm glad we bought it."
3,"Nice playset. Compact, neat and tidy","This set is better than the American Girl Doll teacher setup, although twice the cost too. My daughter loves to play school and teacher. She sets up all her stuffed animals as her students."
2,Bought New..arrived looking used,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my niece. When the package arrived, the box of the product was all beat up and taped together by scotch tape! The only reason that I am keeping it is because the product inside is sealed in plastic."
4,my 8 y.o. daughter loves it,"Wonderful ""school kit"" for kids who love to play school at home - my 8 y.o. daughter enjoys this kit and plays with it often. All materials are in short supply, though, and i don't think it's worth restocking (probably will make our own ""passes"" and ""awards""."
5,Great gift for grandkids!,We sent this to our 4 year old granddaughter for her birthday. According to her dad (our son) she and her 7 year old brother started playing with it immediately and played non-stop for 3 hours. Our granddaughter said the pointer and calendar were just like the ones her teacher has. Her dad told us it was a great gift!
4,Great imaginative play tool,"My 7 year old daughter loves to play school, so she asked Santa for this item. Overall, it's been a great tool for her to expand her imaginative play. I would like to have seen a few more reusable items (like the report cards, etc), however, replacements for these items can easily be ordered - or self generated for those with computers - once the original supply runs out. The folding case is great for keeping all of the supplies together and organized. And my daughter loves it - which is all that really matters to me!"
4,Nice gift,"I bought this for my boyfriend's 4 year old daughter and she really enjoys it. She likes playing the teacher and has a lot of fun with this item. I just wish it was more educational and included different matching and writing practices instead of a bunch of the same one. Although it's not all that educational, it's still a lot of fun for her and I'm overall pleased with the purchase."
5,Grandkids loved this!,Gave this to my grand-daughter ( 3 yrs) for Xmas. Both she and her big brother (5 yrs) loved it. Became the toy of preference for several days. Cute package and very entertaining. Certainly worth the money!
5,Great pretend toy!,"Our daugther is a kindergartner and would come home from school and play school! So thought this would be a good way to help her ""teach"" her younger siblings. I love that it all folds up and is easy to store, there are pockets for everything, it has great props with it. They were thrilled with the map on it, especially since it matched the floor puzzle she had recently got as well. The pointer and bell are of good quality and so far it's been a great addition to our ""lets pretend"" toys! Definitely would recommend to any child who loves to play school!"
4,My daughter loves this,"I purchased this for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it, she plays with it for hours and she really likes the little bell!"
5,Great Learning Toy,"This is a great pretend learning toy. My daughter had and stil has a blast playing school. It is simple, portable, and at a good price. Highly recommend this if anyone has a little one who likes to pretend."
5,A Merchant In Mayhem,"If you are among those souls that view streetfighting as an opportunity to prove your mettle in some highly idealized exercise in hypermasculinity, or somehow view the activity as a right of passage, then ""3 Second Fighter"" is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you are a serious student of Urban Combatives or concerned with what works in the ""Real World"", then the strategy outlined in this book would be classified as imperative. Save the Honor and Glory bit for the appropriate field of battle. Line-up fighting is a highly specialized art form that views such notions as counterproductive. This book is in essence, ""The Shining Path."""
3,Max's Ride,"The original editions of the Max series were absolutely wonderful. The later editions have changed and they are not as whimsical and ""perfect"" in that Max so well represents the young toddler. Please bring back the illustrations of the first editions!!"
5,Max shares his ride with my family,"My fourteen month old daughter loves this book. She carries it around with her wanting it to be read to her all of the time. When you open the first page she shouts GO! (the first word on the first page). The pages have only a few words on them keeping my daughter's attention. The words are very descriptive and make this book very easy to animate. You can take your child along with Max on his ride as you go up, down, over and between-- all the while she is bouncing on your knee."
4,I love technology,"These work like magic. Of course, I've never tried any other noise-cancelling headphones, so I can't compare them with the state of the art. But I use them almost daily on my treadmill, and when I throw the switch and power them up, the treadmill racket nearly goes away. I haven't tried them anywhere else. It would probably be quite hazardous to use them out in the real world while jogging or biking."
4,Another Perspective,"It doesn't add considerable amount of noise when you listen to music. Then again, this depends on the type of music you listen to. If you listen to incredibly soft music (certain genres of classical), then the added static noise will kill ya. For other types of music--jazz, rock, pop, the sound of the music should be enough to render the static sound hardly noticeable.To rectify: while the noise cancelling feature does add that static noise, it also enhances the music, making it louder and clearer. With that, the headphones deliver fairly good highs, lows, and bass. The noise cancelling feature is not comparable to in ear headphones (if you're looking for that, I'd recommend Creative EP 630) or $50-$100 headphones. But if you're on a budget, these headphones go highly recommended."
4,Good enough for the music lab at college,"I love these headphones. I am an audio production and music business major and I've been using these in my Electronic Music and Studio Recording classes. I rate them four stars 'cause I haven't used the noise cancelling feature 'cause I don't need it in that environment. But I love the fold up feature and the semi-hard case (the only such case I found in my hunt for portable headphones) and the full size, over-the-ear coverage. The sound quality is fine, which I was very concerned about with smaller headphones.Apparently a classmate thought they were great, too, 'cause they were stolen last Thursday. I'm ordering another pair now."
2,fair to poor,"Pro's - good sound quality, good filtering quality, long battery life - 20 hours or more on cheap stock batteries, small and easy to handle.Con's - round ear-cups are uncomfortable for my big ears, audible popping in sound with low battery, typical headphone jack jack wareout in an untypical one month - only have sound out of one ear not very hevily used.all in all i think they are worth the price if you can get past the way they fit on you ears and if you can replace the headphone jack when it goes bad."
2,disc 2 won't work right,"hello as much as I like the bakuman anime and the dub was very solid the main problem is that the 2 disk dvd have some problems, I got a dvd of it and the first disc work good but the disc 2 contain the rest of the episodes doesn't work on my dvd.I don't know who to blam but if that is that same with some of the dvd than I say wait for the complete series. media blaster you screw up big time and I want my money back!"
2,A Trial of Innocents,"The book was average, with characters who were a bit flat. The twists at the end were good, but a bit contrived. But approximately a quarter of the book is proselytizing for the Christian faith and has little to do with the plot of the book. Because of the length of the book and the amount of time the author spent on the Christian religion, the plot and character development were a bit rushed. The author is a good writer and sections of the book were very well written. But the book appeared to have the secondary goal of proselytizing."
4,good for the price,"i always wear size 7.5, but this shoe is kinda loose. shud get one size smaller. like the detail...but had to return as it was damaged. the front part is covered with fur like material. but mine had some few round patches with fur missing. but worth for the money."
2,Not for removing polyeurethane,"I bought this with the intent of stripping our oak banister and refinishing it (by the way - hire someone to do that - its horrible). There are several layers of polyeurethane on the banister & it just cannot get through the layers at all. However, some dripped onto the wood trip (its a very messy product) and it took the paint off quicker than I could clean up the drip. I would only recommend this for removing paint and only if you can take your project outdoors or somewhere that you can make a mess."
3,It's okay,I was looking for something fun fro my son to play because he loves race cars and monster trucks. It had all that but it DID NOT come with a wheel as adertised. Just glad I didn't pay full price othrewise I would be very upset.
1,What a crappy game.,Control of vehicles was terrible. Reminded me of some of the worst free on-line truck racing games. Graphics were bad and the kids haven't played it more than 1 or 2 times in the last 5 months. Don't buy this no matter what the price.
4,A must have for the collector,"This informative volume is a must have for the gun collector or historian. It contains a wealth of information in encyclopedia style that is difficult if not impossible to find in other sources, all under one cover. This book will save you countless hours of research."
3,What I think of ghoulies,"I really like the movie ghoulies. I thought it was very dark and magical. I feel it didn't have that much of a story about ghoulies, it was more about black magic. I always wondered about the ending. What ever happened to those three people? When I saw the next movie ghoulies 2 there was no mention of the first group of people. It seems each of the movies had a different story line. I would have liked the movie better, if some of the scenes were during the day, rather than it always being dark and inside the house."
4,Everything via principal bundles.,"Sharpe's book is a detailed argument supporting the assertion that most of differential geometry can be considered the study of principal bundles and connections on them, disguised as an introductory differential geometry textbook.Some standard introductory material (e.g. Stokes' theorem) is omitted, as Sharpe confesses in his preface, but otherwise this is a truly wonderful place to read about the central role of Lie groups, principal bundles, and connections in differential geometry. The theme is that what one can do for Lie groups, one can do fiberwise for principal bundles, to yield information about the base.The informal style (just look at the table of contents) and wealth of classical examples make this book a pleasure to read. While its somewhat nonstandard approach and preference for classical terminology might confuse those who have never been introduced to the concepts, this is a perfect *second* place to read and marvel about differential geometry."
5,Amazing!,"The book ""Differential Geometry: Cartan's Generalization of Klein's Erlangen Program"", purchase from NRVBOOKSPLUS via AMAZON.COM, exceed my expectations! It's completely new. It seems that no one has ever opened it. Also, I received the product very quickly. I'm so pleased with this purchase ande really recommend this seller."
5,We're Going on a Bear Hunt,My class of four year old prekindergarten students want to hear this book over and over again. I'm going on a Bear Hunt is a sure winner!
5,One of the best choices out there,"This is one of the first books my son responded to. I could read it to him and get him to say Uh Oh at the proper point. Months later he was able to add Oh No at the proper point. A book like this, with fun noises, great prepositional phrases, interesting drawings, a funny storyline, an exciting ending, and a repetitive reading sequence, really help children to remember what's going on. A kid who can remember a story can eventually learn to tell you that story, and sometimes even do so long before they're truly reading and decoding the words.The board book format will always be lauded in our household. We like the durability and compactness of the books. The babies can easily turn the pages, the books withstand being thrown (hey, it happens) and stepped on, and the pages can be gnawed on without too much harm.This is one of our favorites."
5,wonderful book,"It is a classic. Reading it to my grandchildren is a real funexperience. Then when they can start saying the words before you do,you know how much they get into the book. Whoosh, whoosh, plop, plop.I feel sorry for the lonely bear at the end."
3,good cd for your children playing,my daughter like this cd she play over and over again and it is good companion as well if you buy the book
4,We love this book,"This is apparently a classic camp song - not one I ever heard growing up, though.My nieces request this book a *minimum* of once a week (and usually, once they request it, they want me to read it over and over again to boot!), and we love it every time. Then they often want me to help them reenact the story - I'll be the bear, then they'll be the bear, then the teddy bear will be the bear....If you're paying attention as you read it, you can even see the various members of the family change their mood as the story goes on and they get hit with various forms of minor disasters."
5,A Classic!,"A classic book for even the youngest children. Babies will enjoy the many sounds (""swish, swish"", etc.) the reader has to make in reading this book. Older children enjoy the anticipation of finding the bear."
5,my mom recommended this one..she was a teacher,OMG..5 month old son loves this book...great rhyme! I love this book...I've practically memorized it! He really pays attentions...wow! Colors aren't that bright but he's still loves pics. Definitely recommend.
2,"Too small, Different story",As an Early Chilhood Educator for 27 years I was disapointed by the book. It is not the storyline I have ever heard. The book is very small (6x6) and bulky for a child to hold. The drawings are sweet but tiny on an already small book. I would never have purchased this book had I looked at it in the store.
2,bear hunt in reverse,I loved this book and song as a child...so I thought that I would get it for my little one. Well it came and the pages are in reverse order and upside down...oh well.
1,A terrible book,"I'm sorry to be the party pooper here, but this is an awful book, which might not be the writer's fault, since it's based on a terrible song. The activities along the way are fun enough. But if a child's book is supposed to be fun, it's also supposed to teach little life lessons. What does this one teach? My 3 year old is terrified of the book. He says the bear is mean. I say, ""Why?"" ""Because he looks big and scary."" So my kid has learned that big, scary-looking, unknown things are mean (if you haven't read the book, the bear does nothing ""mean""--he's just hanging out in his cave). More--if they're provoked and they chase you, it's because they're mean (not because a bunch of kids provoked them). At the same time, my kid loves Shrek, and I love the fact that it teaches him to look beyond surface appearance, to face a big, scary thing and learn about it--not to call it mean when you don't know it, not to bother it and run. The book's just screwy."
5,Delightful fun,"This is one of my three-year-old daughter's favourite books. The repetitive, sing-song chorus (""We're going on a bear hunt, we're going to catch a big one..."") and the sound effects, as the family passes through tall grass, mud, a river, a forest and a snowstorm before reaching the bear's cave, will delight any pre-schooler. (For even more fun, use your child's teddy bear as a prop when the bear in the story finally makes his appearance.)This book is great fun for both parent and child. It's one you won't soon tire of reading."
4,Great book!,Gave one each to my two grandsons. They loved it! Now they want to go on a bear hunt with grandma!
2,Not what i expected or hoped for,This CD is rather a disappointment. It starts off quietly with somewhat hushed voices that I hardly knew it had begun. I have gotten used to the vibrant and joyous toddler cds that this was a surprise and very disappointing considering how exciting the story can be. I like to read Going on a Bear Hunt in a happy exicted voice with little toddlers following along. This is not that story with any of the same excited enthusiasm. I'm sorry i bought this one without hearing any of the tracks first.
4,Lots of Fun!,"This is one I missed growing up, and was glad to be introduced to by a Mommy-friend of mine. The illustrations are charming, the rhyme well constructed and rhythmic (something so often bungled by children's authors, it seems!), and the story is fun. I also appreciate that the pictures feature a father spending fun, imaginative time with his kids."
5,The most enjoyable children's book I have read in a long time.,I have this book and it is one of the most enjoyable children's book I have read in a long time.I love that it comes with it's own stuffed toy bear.The stuffed bear is a good size bear for your child to cuddle while you read this enchanting book to him or her about hunting for a bear.It will bring it more to life for your child while you read the book together.The illustrations in this book are fun and enjoyable to look at.This is a must to add to your child/children's library.I give it a thumbs up and 5 stars our of 5 stars.
5,Wonderful book.,I love this book! I am a elementary special education teacher and my students love this book as much as I do. It is a wonderful story to read over and over. Also great for the children to perform.
1,"beautiful book, but disk wont work in US so whats the point","well..i could have bought the plain book and was extremely disappointed that the disk was unusable in the US... unless maybe on a computer, i dont know...i felt like it didnt state that point very clearly on the the description... BUt i didint want to go through the aggravation of returning it so i gave it to cousins who like in the UK for their kids. the books looked so nice and the pictures were darling so i was pretty sad about this purchase in the end"
3,Not the same,I bought this thinking it was the same as the version I learned as a kid. It's still fun but just not the same. The older version had more sound effects and variety in actions.
2,Don't know the song? Pass on it.,"I never grew up with this song but got the book since it had such great reviews. Well, the drawings are lovely and I can understand the interest in the sounds used but all in all, my daughter and I never found a good rhythm with this book's words/lyrics since we did not know the song. She has no interest in it really."
2,Smaller than you may think,"I was disappointed to receive this in the mail. I ordered it for my niece. I didn't particularly think that the quality of the smaller book was that nice (not a board book type- just a really small paperback). And the bear isn't much bigger than a beanie baby. It was my fault for not looking at the dimensions, but I would've like a bigger book and bear for the price. If you're wanting a tiny book and bear, then order.As far as the story itself... I love the story and read it to my children. Its repetitive and kids love it. Fun to use motions while reading it! We clap our lap, and then our hands to the rhythm...""going on a bear hung, we're gonna catch a big one""...the kids love it. I would personally prefer a bigger book, however."
1,Pretty useless,"The book says that even if you are a keen 'arcade junkie' wishing to program, you can learn from this book. Well that is basically me, I like games and wanted to program em. So I got this book. The first bit was easy to understand, talking about the concepts of a game. Then, very helpfully, he dived in right at the deep end! Started talking about very complex code, this and that, i gave up half way thru chapter three. I dunno if this would be easy to understand even if you DID know basic C, because I don't, but for a beginner like me it is IMPOSSIBLE. What a waste of time and money."
4,This is really a good book !!!,"I just buy my modem two weeks ago, and I'm new at Amazon. I have read many computer books and I want to know other person comments about my good book and this book is on the list. I'm shock knowing there is a lot of lazy guy ( forgive me about my word ) who found little errors in the CD and rated this book only one star ( You said you are a programmer ?????? ). I must admit that I also found errors when compile the source code, but with few changes I solved the problem. Attention here.... my knowledge about C is lack and I don't even know anything about C++. I read this book 3 years ago and I found it very usefull for me ( beginner at game programming ). The reason I didnt rate this book 5 stars is some chapters are not usefull, but this book is still a good book..."
1,Not a good book,"I bought this book hoping to learn to write games, I very shortly found out that the CD leaves a lot of stuff out that the book wants, the programs on the CD were poorly written, and the book's ""programs"" didn't actually have any code but rather just some include statements and a few meaningless phrases and brackets, that of course didn't work in the compiler. I do have experience in C programming, having completed a C programming course and both volumes of C programming for dummies. I would recommend you do not get this book."
3,Little beyond the basics.,"As with other books, I thought this book provided more examples and explanations, and tought me some stuff, but I was wrong. This book merely goes over what we did in school. Gives you bunch of ideas, but not worth the money. Very little 3-D game programming information too."
1,Old As The Hills :),This book is extremely out of date and should have been taken out of print years ago. The example code is useless unless you struggle to find a medieval compiler (probably only available on a 5 1/4 inch disk!). Now that I have more programming experience I still find that there is very little useful or up-to-date information in this book.Buy a newer book!!
2,Didn't help....Nothing worked...,I bought this book thinking it would be a good guide for game programming. I was wrong. None of the examples worked. (Used Microsoft Visual C++ V5.0) . The compiler always reported errors on all the examples so I couldn't learn how to program when the code he typed himself doesn't work.If you find a way to run his code email me.
2,Bad experience purchasing a book,I emailed someone--didn't receive the CD with it like I'm supposed to. Who can help out with that. I purchased it for a gift so I haven't really done much with it.
2,I was waiting more PhotoShop,"55% of the book is about how to take a good digital photography. And the rest is about PhotoShop, is not enough. I'm disappointed"
4,digital photographers,Interesting book in that it begins at the bottom and builds up to some fairly advanced photoshop work. I keep it as a reference and read it before i head out on any important shoot. Ironic that i'm going back to Italy soon - he's given me a lot of ideas on what and how to approach the project.
4,Photoshop as an artistic tool,"This book is a labor of love by the author. A lot of time and effort went into producing this, for the obvious reason that Mr. Giordan loves his subject matter.I should be clear in saying that this isn't a book about photography. It's a book about taking photographs and Photoshop to produce art (in the traditional way of thinking of art).It's well written and the reader really needs to do the exercises to get the most out of it.If producing ""art"" from your photography is your goal, this is a great book to have as a reference."
3,The Art of Photoshop,This book has some useful photohop information but the author gives bad step by step instructions. I am an intermediate photoshop user and I still get lost trying to follow his instructions.
1,"not as described - nitrite drops, NOT strips",this was supposed to be 180 nitrite and nitrate test strips. i was sent a vial and solution to test for nitrite only. i have filed a claim with amazon because this seller has not responded to any of my emails regarding returning this item because it was listed incorrectly. i am very disappointed.
3,More could be said,"I am a direct descendent of the Hatfields of West Virginia. My 3rd great granddfather migrated west and settled in the town of Mossyrock, WA. The good in this book is its focus on the lore of the two families. The stories have been passed down from generation to generation. Who did what to whom and how they related to each other. The bad is its lack of attention to the sociology of the feud: was it really family honor or is the poverty of the region to blame? What about the federal governments interference? We hear so much about the ATF/FBI at Waco, but the federal government was a critical factor in the feud in its later years. My grandfather moved to Washington because he faced potential arrest by the federal government."
2,Poorly written,"I was very interested in reading this book, based on the other reviews written. However, I had a difficult time with it. The writing was very jarring. At one point, a manuscript has almost 300 pages, but a few paragraphs later the same manuscript is barely 200 pages. The heroine has curly hair, and a little later has straight hair.... I found myself spending more time saying ""Hey, wait a minute..."" and going back to check facts that didn't jive...."
4,Fans of action...Read This Book!,"If you like Preston & Child, Matthew Reilly, Robert Masello or Jeremy Robinson then you'll like this author! Loved all the books in this series."
2,Maybe...,"Alot of the reviewers note good research and detail, while the research is probably above par the detail is excruciating! I am trying so hard to like this book and characters but 1/2 way through I am one more page closer to deleting it forever. It's all been said before in previous reviews... poorly written, lack of structure and having to wade through the inconsistinces is painful. I would like to finish this book only because of the time I have invested in it but don't know if I can...update 8/16/11I did finish it and he just about redeems himself in the end except for the redundancies over emoted scenes. I will get his second book because its only $3 and see if there is an improvement with the edititing and writing. Still a 2 star book..."
2,very poorly written,"Breathtakingly wide adventure, but this book screams for an editor. Verb tense and punctuation errors, along with factual inconsistencies, make for difficult reading. Skim and toss. As much as I'd like to know the rest of the trilogy story, I don't think I'll buy them."
3,"Excellent concept, very disjointed writing style","I was struck by the concept of The Cryptids Trilogy and eagerly purchased the 1st book of the series. The 1st thing that struck me was that the book is hard to read. The author interlaces his writing with a lot of unnecessary comments and stuff out of left field. His style seems vaguely reminiscent of something written by a sophomore in high school that doesn't quite grasp or understand syntax or sentence structure. Perhaps if he got a different editor it might help. On top of that, the main character is kind of a pussy. I haven't finished the 1st book yet and at this point, unless this improves I can't say that I'd recommend this to anyone who reads beyond a grade school level...but, the concept is marvelous and if you can look past the writing style of the author then the book may be enjoyable."
5,A pleasent read!!,I enjoyed this book and it's a pleasure to see an author writing on the subject of unknown animals and take this science seriouslythe subject matter is very interesting and opens my mind to the possiblities of the existence of large thunderbirds still living today. I look foward to future novels written by D.L. Tanner.
1,Save your money.,The story idea was good but the writing is horrible. It has taken me two weeks to get only half way thru the book because the sentences are so poorly written that you get lost in the middle. And the character discriptions and motives are all over the place. Save your money...the author and whoever proofread this must be illiterate!!!
1,Shadow of the Thunderbird,Very poorly written! I was astonished a book could make it through the most elementary editing with this many errors. It was impossible to keep up with the plot because of all the structural mistakes. These problems are sad because in this book is a great idea for a book. This however is not that book!
3,For completists only,"A stab at the contemporary pop songs of the time by one of the great voices of any age, this album winds up being a curiosity at best. The only song of note is ""Summer Wind"" which, while not surpassing Frank Sinatra's definitive version, is a nice attempt anyway. On the whole, interesting, but likely to be the least played Hartman CD I own (and I own several, all superior to this one.)"
1,cheesy!!,"It looks great on screen, but it is so thin, the leather tore in the first few days. Definately a piece of trash. And there is only a 10 day window to get purchases back to this seller."
3,What's left in this friendship stays in this friendship,"Mona has a wonderful relationship with her husband Edwin. It is like they are still on their honeymoon even though it has been 15 years since the day they said ""I do."" They hope the one thing that can make their relationship unbreakable is worth it.ShaLisa is a sistergirl from around the way and takes no crap. After years of playing the field, her friends are happy to see that she is settling down. Hopefully her friends will like her new beau and can accept that love just happens.Ebony has went through the unthinkable, a divorce. Dealing with the remnants of a broken marriage and spirit, moving on sometimes is easier said than done.When times are tough you realize sometimes your girlfriend is just like having a sister. Just Between us is an enjoyable read and looking forward to more works by Wyndy."
3,el mesias,"Esta segunda parte de la saga de Dunas es el menos interesante de los seis escritos por Herbert, aún así es capaz de mantener la atención en él hasta el final. Si bien no es una parte medular de la historia completa, si es impotante para entender los acontecimientos que se vivirán después. Aparece un extraño profeta que está ciego en el desierto acompañado por un ""lazarillo"", que grita en contra de la religión establecida en torno a Muad dib, grita en torno de las castas sacerdotales y de todos aquellos que tienen el control politico de arraquis y del universo (aquí Herbert hace uno de sus excelentes discursos de critica social-político-religiosa). Siendo al final el mismo ""sacrificado"" por sus visiones."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Implementation","I purchased this drive from Costco two days ago. It worked great the first night and I loaded it up with files. The next day at work the drive refused to function. The blue LED would come on for a few seconds then turn off. This cycle would repeat forever.I called the SimpleTech Tech Support number and their technician informed me that the drive was dead. He stated that because the drive has a rotating platter it must be treated very carefully. He also informed me that you MUST use the ""safely remove hardware"" function of Windows XP.The technician actually suggested I return the device and look into portable notebook drives. Now I'm passing that information on to you.I really wanted this device. It's very small and portable which is what I want. Unfortunately, it simply didn't work out for me."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!,"I must say, after reading the reveiws on this item, mine actually lasted me over a year. I wish I would have read these reviews before I bought it. Just like everyone else, The light comes on but knowone is home. Doesnt work anymore. I lost lots of important files because I depended on it. Well, I learned my lesson. You get what you pay for!"
5,It's the best book i have ever read!,"This is truly a fantastic book worth reading...I admit it's pretty thick, but don't let that scare you off..once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down! If anyone knows where you can find 'Merlin : The King's Wizard' and the third book ( I don't know what it's called ) please e-mail me at hsinginez@hotmail.com! Like I've already said, a terrific book looking back at the magical times. After you read this, you'll believe that a magical time really did exist!"
4,Ghost Goes West; Donat at his best.,"Imaginative; clever; light-hearted approach to the supernatural. Good storytelling. Well-cast with Robert Donat playing a double roll. Eugene Pallette was good, too."
3,Great acting,I love Robort Donat. I try and see everything he has done. The Ghost Goes West was classic Donat and his charm shined through as always.
4,GLORIOUS GHOST COMEDY.,"This somewhat crude, frolicsome satire on America was written by the the great playwright Robert E. Sherwood and was directed by the esteemed Rene Clair: A rich American, played by basso-voiced Eugene Pallette, buys Glourie Castle in Scotland (complete with it's miserable ghostly inhabitant) and has it dismantled and shipped across the Atlantic to Sunnymeade, Florida where it's reconstructed complete with plumbing and electricity...The movie is very lucky in its star: Robert Donat brings elegance and his melancholy face and voice to the dual role of Donald Glourie and Murdoch Glourie, his phantom ancestor - and, intermittently, he redeems the action. Elsa Lanchester and Jean Parker are amusing in this mid-thirties frolic in which Americans were poked fun at. They took the barbs good-naturedly and loved the film; it was a very popular picture at the box-office."
4,good movie,"I ordered this movie on a whim. I was ordering the old Canterbury Ghost and I remembered this one from my old movie watching days. It is similar in nature to the Canterville Ghost, except there is no kid .... more of a romantic comedy with a ghost. Perfect for a lazy winter day.... Very funny. Dated material and black and white is probably a turn-off to today's kids.The print, apparently made when ordered, is in excellent condition."
1,Handles Ripped on first trip,"This bag appears to be a great deal at around $20, but it is too cheap. I used it once to travel domestically, and when I got to my destination, one of the handles had ripped from the side of the bag. Clubs had no problems, although they were wrapped by towels."
4,Excellent complete history,"Douglas Porch is the supreme authority on the history of northern Africa. Not only has he given us the definitive history of the French Foreign Legion, in ""The Conquest of the Sahara"" he has widened his canvas to include the part played by the regular French Army in the colonization of one of the most exotic regions on earth. His attention to detail is wonderful and his style keeps the reader turning the pages."
4,excellent study of an obscure subject,"This book attempts to answer the question of why and how the French army took control of the Sahara desert. The ""why"" question is not easily answered but Porch does his best to describe the politics of the era. But in the end we can no more answer that question than we could today explain the housing bubble or internet stock bubble in America.Of more interest are the people and the expeditions that accomplished the conquest of the Sahara. As well as the locals who fought against it. Some of the author's theorizing about the locals is overly modern and really annoying but as a whole the book is ok. If you like great adventure and stories of the conquest of a remote and unhospital place full of hostile people, this is the book for you."
1,depressing and uninspiring,"I was very disappointed with this book. I have had Type 1 diabetes since I was 15 and I am 26 now. I couldn't relate at all to Ms. Roney's prolonged focus on being and ""outcast"", and I don't understand the logic of blaming failed romances and friendships on diabetes. I was hoping to find a book about someone who learned to accept and live with this disease. The author has a way to go to reach that point."
4,A good demonstration of how diabetes and emotions interact,"Although melodramatic at times, like the disease, Roney accurately captures the ""feelings"" side of living with and rebelling against diabetes. I plan to share this book with friends and family to explain how important it is to discuss the emotional effect of diabetes on the lives of diabetics and their families. I loved the title's irony."
3,Pretty uncomfortable...,"I have used c-rings before and they DO enhance an orgasm as well as help with a better erection. In my opinion, use the thinner ""o-ring"" style. It is stetchable and can be put on and removed with much more ease. This product is made of thick hard rubber and has little or no give. A painful chore to put on and remove."
3,Cyberpunk? Yeah. Literature? No.,"This collection of short stories and poems is interesting, but it really doesn't advance the genre past the markers set by Gibson, Stephenson and Sterling. Frequent spelling mistakes (""Leibowitz,"" as in _A_Canticle_For_Leibowitz_, is misspelled as ""Liebowitz,"" for example) and sloppy diction mar a great deal of the stories in the anthology.If you're a die-hard fan of cyberpunk, then this might be interesting (if only to compare non-published authors with the Big Three), but if you're new to the genre, try to find a copy of _Mirrorshades_ used, or pick up _Burning_Chrome_ by William Gibson. Pat Cadigan also has an anthology of cyberpunk coming out in paperback in 2004."
5,Very pleased.,"Package arrived five days early, with high-quality packaging and in perfect condition. The poster itself was as advertised - high in quality, well detailed, and vibrantly colored. All figures and architectural details about the work are clear, and the exceptional size of the poster lends it a stately appearance, worthy of a reproduction of the stature and proportion of the actual work. Great buy."
5,Excellent after all...,"They made an understandable error by delivering me a different lovely poster of the same artist - I would have kept it, but I still wanted the specific one, so when I let them know, they sent to me the correct one at no charge. From their immediate response I realized that they are not making errors often - that was just a very rare instance.Overal, it means very good customer service even for items that are not expensive.Finally, the impressive size and the quality of the picture are excellent as well."
3,SEEMS OUT OF TEMPO,With Hank Jones Ron Carter and Tony Williams. This isn't a real good session. Jackie hadn't recorded in 3 and 1/2 years and from the sound of it hadn't practiced very much either.and don't count on Hank Jones to get things going either. Hank's playing the bridge on the opening chorus of Confirmation sounds a bit silly even demeaning to the classic version Jackie did on that 4 5 and 6 date for Prestige two decades earlier. The fact that they play 3 ballads is further evidence that somthing is amiss here. Jackie didn't record much after this 1978 date but he actually sounded better in 1991 The Jackie Mac Attack-Live. Jack also plays well on BIRDOLOGY VOLs 1 and 2 a jam session from 1989 with Johnny Griffin Don Sickler etc.
1,I am disappointed,I am very disappointed. This telescope is not worth the money spent on it and I will like to return it to the store. The instructions are aweful.
1,Not a good buy,I bought this for my Daughter who is really in to space and wants to learn all she can. This telescope is not the money I spent on it. I came with direction that were useless.
1,Unuseable instructions.,The instructions whhich accompany this telescope are at best usless. I bought it for my grandson and neither his parents nor I can figure out how to view anything. I am severely disappointed not so much with the telescope but with the instructions which failed miserably to tell me how to enjoy this product.
2,No Assembly Instructions,"This item came in a generic box which was the shipping box. It was difficult to confirm if this was the exact thing (model?) that I ordered on Amazon. No assembly instruction came with the item so it was difficult to know if all the parts needed were in there, and of course it made it challenging to set-up. It crossed my mind if Amazon had sent me a used product????Unfortunately, I just don't have the time to package it back up into the shipping box to send it back to Amazon. I'm also too busy to take a trip to the Post Office. To begin with, I was too busy to go to the retail stores in my local area to buy a badminton set locally; hence, the Amazon order.If you decide to buy this item, good luck. Be prepared to be disappointed."
1,Waste of money; do not buy!,"What a waste of money....almost $100 for a net and some cheap (and I mean CHEAP!) rackets and shuttlecocks??? Those rackets fell apart after the first use! Such cheap ""Made in China"" crap.The net is just ""ok"" and not great like other reviewers (what the hell are you seeing?) have stated. If this wasn't for a birthday party, and the cheap rackets didn't fall apart, it would have been shipped back asap......DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY; SAME CRAP HERE THAT YOU CAN GET IN ANY WALMART/TARGET, ETC......SHAME ON THIS SELLER!"
4,Great Set for everything but the rackets and shuttlecocks,Nice set. Easy to setup and nets and poles and borders are great quality. I have my own racket and use feather birdies so i really didnt care that it came with cheap rackets and birds but everything else was top quality. I play weekly and have had no problems with this set. It would have been nice it they just offered it without the cheap rackets and birdies and charged a lower price.
2,Looks Great - Performs Poorly,I was excited to set this badminton set up. We were looking for a family set - nothing too fancy - just durable. It looked great when we set it up - was easy to do. The racquets are lightweight. Unfortunately it has only been up for 3 days and is not standing up well. We've played probably a total of 10 games. The first night one of the strings snapped on a racquet. Since then the 3 others handles are coming unwound and the ends keep slipping off. We already have a hole in the net.This set has not undergone any weather yet - and we have only used it mildly (no rough treatment). Needless to say we are very disappointed with the product. Not worth the extra money.
3,"Decent, but could benefit from minor improvements","Good quality poles, but no anchor spike at the bottom to plant it. Also could have used a third rope on each pole. Net was also decent quality, buy top string was not easy to tie. Racquets and shuttlecocks were fine. Lastly, instructions were very poor. A few more pictures and words would have been appropriate. Probably worth the money, but not impressive...."
5,More than Satisfied,"Definitely not the cheapest Badminton set one can buy. But you get what you pay for and I am more than happy with this product. The quality is such that I believe it will last my family a long time and provide many summers of enjoyment. Easy to set up and I like the somewhat heavy duty stakes. I also like the carrying/storage case that comes with it. If for what ever reason something happens to this set, I'd buy another without a second thought."
4,Not bad Could use a few impovemtns,Overall the set is not bad. But for $85 i would like to see a few improvements.Easier to install net(Like park and sun volleyball nets) without the tension rope on the top of the net.better quality rackets and birdies)I would recommend the kit to anybody looking to buy a whole system.
3,Badminton Set,"I was very happy with the quality of the net and having the ability to map out the court with the rope was great. The racquets appeared at first to be sturdy: tight strings and good racquet quality, but the handles, after only a couple of uses, the tape unwound. The shuttlecok tips broke off very easily. Mind you we are just a family using this and after one week all the shuttlecocks are broken. The glow in the dark idea was fun and my younger teenagers really had fun playing after dark. However, the tips on these broke quickly too."
1,Don't let looks or cool pics of this product fool you !!!,"It just looks and says best but when you actually install the net, the polls are of your chest height. Probably good for 5-7 yrs old kids. Racquets are of cheap quality. (Of course, made in China). Needless to say any more...Park & Sun BM-PS/ALUM Badminton Pro Set"
2,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed in this set. One of the racquets had broken strings right out of the package. Racquets are very poor quality as well as the birdies. Net is pretty good quality but we have already broken 3 of the stakes. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Wish I could get my money back.
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this Badmitten set for husband birthday and the first time using the handles fell off. So, I sent and email and they sent a whole new set, but now I have two to return. The second time out the rest of handles fell off??? Lot of money for cheap set!Thanks,Janie"
3,"Nice set, but poor quality birdies & stakes","This is a good set overall for the price. The poles are sturdy and the net quality is good. The rackets are also well made, but not comparable to higher-end rackets. The carrying case is nice for mobility and storage. The birdies are poor in quality; the bottom cone popped out after a few hard hits on the 1st hour of use. The stakes are weak and when inserted on hard clay ground, can easily break and bend. Our stakes were shot after 2nd instllation and had to order new ones. Be careful while driving them into the ground and do not pull too hard. The warranty period in only 30 days, not very comforting!"
3,"better than cheap set, but too expensive for what it is","I ordered this set recently and have played with it several times now. While the poles are sturdy enough, and certainly more robust that what is found in cheaper sets, the overall package is hardly worth the money in absolute terms. I could not find a better set in my online and b&m; search, so I guess I should be happy with a functional product. Considering the cost of materials, I would say this should be half or one third the price.The racquets are average, with hard plastic grips. Advantage here is that the grip wrap won't come off. Disadvantage is that the grips are slick when wet and not very comfortable."
4,Park and Sun Badminton Set,"I purchased this after reading reviews on Amazon. I purchased a set from Dicks and took it back in a week. What I like is the sleeve for the net versus grommets and string. The only down is the stakes snap too easily. I moved the stakes to mow and the stakes snap. I do have a few spares in the garage, but you would think it would be durable.I like it!! Buy some extra shuttlecocks!! Those don't last long!Brown Bomber"
3,Decent but not perfect,"This product is bult a little better than others i have purchased but this product suffers from the same flaws I returned all the other defective items for.In my case the wrapping on all 4 rackets started to come loose and unravel on first use and only a few weeks later I noticed the the net is alreay disintegrating.I went against my own judgment but I was better off ordering a cheap set and replace it every year. This was was 100+ Bucks and am already experiencing the same issue.By the cheaper set use it the rest-of the year, you will be better off."
5,Absolutely worth the money,"Was totally tired of these $30 sets that are basic trash and was looking for a set that would last the season. Easy to set up. sturdy and looks good. nice addition is the court outline that they provide. negatives: the game rules are a little confusing and the racquets are not the best. with this set, you are buying the court not the racquets. if you dont like the racquets, that is relatively easy to fix."
3,Net & Poles are excellent; Rackets are low quality,"Net and poles are very high quality, but the rackets are low quality/flimsy. The strings broke on one of the rackets during the first game. I contacted Park & Sun Sports about a replacement racket and they referred me back to seller (i.e. Amazon). It was not worth the hassle of returning set only to receive another set with the same rackets. Plan on replacing rackets, if you purchase this set..."
4,Excellent Net & Poles; Racquets are mediocre,Easy set up. Poles and net are sturdy and likely to last. The racquets *seem* flimsy but we haven't had any problems. Looking forward to summer evenings of family badminton.
5,Was everything I thought it might be.,This is a dying art its hard to find anything dealing with plastic canvas anywhere. Glad I found the hummingbirds cause we love that time of the year when the hummingbirds come threw and there beautiful color.
2,Holistic Highway - Tarot,"This is like a homemade movie. Just filming a person in a very casual classroom. People didn't even respect the speaker enough to show up on time. They keep coming in after she started speaking. She didn't make sure her props were even the right size before filming, like the table she is using is a TV tray table. Then she doesn't do the layout she chose correctly and has to readjust (confusing if you're a beginner). I still was trying to get something from the ""fluff"" she is saying and I ended up falling asleep. The only thing I got from the first 20-30 minutes was ""see what the cards mean to you"". I will try watching again and maybe it gets better."
3,Not as good as the first one.,It wasn't as good as the first one. I still would recommend it but don't expect it to surpass the first one.
5,Championship Book Review,"This is one of the most beneficial books I have ever read. it is easy to follow, it is fun to read and I was eagerly awaiting the next page. If you are serious about coaching, this is a must have book.I can assure you that team chemistry is an important part of a team success and this book really addresses the issues around this."
4,coaching book,Bought this for my husband who coaches power soccer (soccer played on indoor basketball court with people who use power/electric wheelchairs). I haven't read it but liked what I saw in the TOC. He's been reading it and got some ideas to use with his team.
5,A Really Good Album,"All of the tracks on this album is really good. Hip Hop at its finest. I know theres people that disagree but im definately comparing this to whats out today. I give this a 5 only because Pun is keeping it true to hip hop and is actualy lyrical. Beats are good, lyrics are good. Thats all you need."
4,Better then most,"Not a classic like his first,but still better then most efforts.Especialy in the age of bling and non-rhyme skills.Pun still shows he had more talent in his fat little pinky toe then 99% of the rappers alive today."
5,The best latin MC to grace the mic,"I first heard Big Pun back on ""Capital Punishment"" (which was great) and I was hooked. Let me get right down to it, Pun brought some of the fiercest flow and lyrics to the mic ever, and he didn't just stick with one style on this CD, he reached out. Reached out to the mainstream rap fans, reached out to the hardcore underground fans, and reached out to all the hip hop heads, R.I.P. Big Pun."
3,RI.P. PUN (but take this cd wit u),"for weeks i was like itz gone be good itz gone be good. i get it my eyes light up i listened to it. i start immediately on track 4(itz so hard) i throw my hands up and start listenin to other tracks and they immediately come down. i really want to say this cd is tight, but i can't. itz ok. it ain's sorry but capitol punishment was a hell of a lot betta. it jus ain't the same. some good tracks are leatherface, itz so hard, watch those, ny giants, and you was wrong. the rest are singin and other stuff that jus don't appeal to me. one thing that might have helped it was more terror squad or other artists who are dope and a less of tony sunshines singin. well in conclusion it ain't a waste of money but don't expect a masterpiece. R.I.P. PUN We'll never forget u."
2,"Better than Cap. Punishment, but still sucks!!","There are 3 classics on here, & they are Its So Hard, 100% & Ms. Martin, peace!!!"
5,2nd Greatest Album Ever Made,"This album is only second to Capital Punishment, this album is better than anything Biggie,Tupac,Eminem,or 50 Cent ever put out..And Proves Once Again That Pun Perfected The Rap Game.LGP (Latins Going Platinum)"
2,Weak,"I hate to say this, because I had been really looking forward to this album, but it's weak. If you don't have the first Big Pun yet, then get that one first. This CD suffers from lots of R&B type beats (like his first single), and lackluster delivery. Maybe I'm a little unfair because his first CD was great, and this one just doesn't even come close to the standard he set. If you're looking for some nice rhymes of Big Pun, maybe you should check D.I.T.C. where his guest rhymes are easily better than most of what he does on his sophomore album."
1,YEEEEAHHH BABY....THIS C.D. IS WHACK,"If you are a fan of CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, do not get this one. He doesn't even sound like Big Pun. His voice was all dead. His flow was so off. His rhymes were really weak. The only track I liked was NEW YORK GIANTS mainly because of the help from M.O.P. The beats sounded so bad, it sounded like he wanted to appeal to those commercial rap fans. He should've put more effort into this album. But cherish his only good album CAPITAL PUNISHMENT because you will never hear another one like that..."
5,Sooooooooooo Tight,"Most of the cds I get I rate pretty high, because I put careful choice into my purchases...but dammmmm this is sooooo right that this gets five stars. The beats are tight. And he was an incredible artist. R.I.P Big Pun, u were admired by many"
4,"Not as good, but almost!",Big Pun was one of the tightest rappers ever. His capitalpunishment album was better than yeah baby but this new album ispretty good with the song it's so hard. it is too bad he couldnt stay alive to see his success. STILL NOT A PLAYER on his first album is his best song ever and the best rap song out there in my opinion. BIG PUN KICKS!
2,Not That Hot,I got the Big Pun album expecting it to be real tight. I was dead wrong. The beats were just alright and the lyrics rated a 6 out of 10. This album made me think twice about considering him to be one of the greatest rappers of all time.
3,Almost there,"I like Big Punisher. His death is a loss to the hip hop community. The CD is good; not great. I missed his first release so this is essentially the first time I heard him in the context of a complete work. I found some cuts weak, like ""My Dick"". He could of come with a much better hook. From what I've heard, don't judge him from this cut. I'm going to listen to his previous CD. I don't like the hype around him being Latino. The thing is, he was a rapper, and a good one: that's enough."
2,underground to commercial,"his first album was a classic, this one i guess he tried to commercialize himslef. He should have just stuck to what he was doin"
3,Good but not the best,"I honestly think Pun's first album was better. Some tracks lacked even with Pun's quick lyrical tongue. Still I say ""Rest in Peace"" kid you still drop heavy than most of these cats out."
2,A sad farewell,"I rate Capital Punishment as one of the dopest albums in my collection. Even we fans of ""intelligent rap"", who weren't always down with everything Pun had to say, could not help but give props to an incredibly gifted lyricist who could flow like few can. Unfortunately, the last effort from now departed Christopher Rios lacks much of the driving style that made Capital Punishment the bomb. The production is good, but the rhymes are weak, and not well delivered. It is a shame that one of the greats had to leave this as his legacy."
2,Cd,well I have puns first cd and this new one and I don't think this lp comes as strong as the other one I don't feel it's beats and to me it's not the same style as his last but I was feeling it's so hard so I gave It 2 stars.
2,R.I.P very Forgettable Disc,Big Pun was a Cool Brother but his Work was Often Lacking.the Music&Lyrics here just are Typical Industry Fair.We Don't Care is a Tight cut as is My Turn.but on a Whole it's nothing worth Getting.it's Sad cuz He had some Talent.but this isn't the way it should have Ended.
1,Why even try?,"Boy if I was him I'd fall off of the face of the earth. Hecan't rap...from what I've heard. And I've heard both albums...so,that's kinda bad. I don't believe there is any good songs on this cd...and there were 3 on the other one...will he just get worse and worse?..."
2,"BiG PuN ComeS BacK, WACK!","Big Pun's first album, capital punishment, is one of the best albums I have ever heard. However this one, was a dissappointment. It's So hard and We Don't care are two very hot songs. However the rest of the album is filled with corny lyrics, corny beats,and big pun runs on the same rhyming scheme, which gives people a headache. The two stars are only given because those two songs deserve it. This album is nothing like Life after death from the late Notorious B.I.G. If you bought the album expecting hot tracks, this time, you might even get a heart attack."
3,not worth your money,"Yeeeah baby by Big Pun has a limited number of good songs. The cd as a whole is pretty terrible accually but i give it 3 stars because the few songs that are good... Off With His Head, Watch those, It's so hard, and 100% are amazing. Big Pun is the kind of artist that you are better off getting a greatest hits cd (if one exists)because each one of his cds only has a maximum of 5 or 6 good songs however if you were to put the best 5 songs from each of his cds together; now we're talkin. Or alternativly you could go on to iTunes and download the few good songs."
3,Big Pun - Yeeeah Baby,"There are a few good tracks on here like ""100%"" and ""New York Giants"" (featuring M.O.P.). But there were just too many classic moments on Capital Punishment (his first album) that the bar was set too high for this album. Also, Pun's quick-tongue rhymes started to sound like he was babbling, probably due to his ailing health. In some songs, you could tell his voice was weakening, which was a sign that he was dying. A good album, just not great. R.I.P., Pun"
4,rest in peace pun,"big pun is possibly my favorite latino rapper of all time. this album is mostly good but a few weak tracks bring it down from acertain 5 to a 4. the tracks i didn't particularly enjoy are the bizarre leather face, and wrong ones which could've had a lot better production. now to the good side of the cd. the hardcore off wit his head is a great track, the collaboration with m.o.p. on n.y. giants is sure to keep heads nodding, andms. martin is another great song and u might recognize remy martin as big pun's wife. but my overall favorite is you was wrong. drag-on, the fromerlyy weak fat joe, pun, and remy martin all spit fine verses. the beats which i thought were spectacular were the guitar on watch those, the island-latino beat on 100%, and the ancient chinese beat on ms. martin. if u have any respect for big pun and all his accomplishments pick this up. peace out."
4,RIP BIG PUN,The untimely death of the greatest latino rapper left us wanting more. This piece is good but not as good as CAPITAL PUNSHIMENT. It's So Hard is a great song and its meaning is kind of ironic. My favorite song on this joint is 100%. It speaks on Puerto Rican pride. Big Pun will be greatly missed but he left us some great material to remember him by.
3,"Interesting read, but redundant","I have enjoyed reading this book, but find that it is redundant. It is about the author's own personal experience of evolving into an art therapist in the mental health field. The book could have been written on half as many pages if he just got to the point or the heart of the matter. It is still a good reference, however."
3,Amusing Indie Horror Flick,This movie is so bad it's good.I like cheap horror flicks once in a while & the camp humor was very entertaining. Whether it's really worth $25 to see is very doubtful - but I laughed so much it was worth it.
5,my son loves it,"My just-turned-4-year-old absolutely adores this book. No, the writing isn't amazing or original. Most of it is just conveniently rhymed verse. There are, however, a few good, well-written poems in the book. But my son loves every part of it, and I enjoy reading it to him. It's fun and silly. The author is definitely creative and entertaining. So while it's not great literature, it still gets 5 stars from my son and me."
1,Disappointment,"This book falls way below the standards of good writingor good reading. It's disappointing and frankly, unoriginal.Poems intertwined with potty humor and so obviously doneso for book sales."
4,Stylish winter wedge,"Great price for this shoe, looks lovely with jeans or short pants. The sole is not slippery at all, which is good for a high wedge. I've worn it twice, and have not felt any discomfort. I would recommend it!"
1,NOT HAPPY,THE SHOES WERE PORRLY MADE. THE RIGHT PEEP TOE IS SET BACK FURTHER THEN THE LEFT. IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND LOOKS STRANGE.
2,mindful meditation review,"I will make this review quick and to the point. I found Jon Kabat-Zinn's voice on the recording to be very uncomfortable to listen to. I can't quite articulate why, it just doesn't seem natural or flowing, which is essential to relaxing the mind. It was recommended by a friend who obviously didn't find a problem with it. I would suggest listening to a portion of it (maybe on itunes) before buying it."
3,board shorts,"It didn't specify if it was for men or ladies, and I was looking for board shorts for ladies and when it came , it was for men. It was a good thing that it fits my husband, otherwise it was a waste of money,"
4,Beautifully done,A joy to travel with Lily through her troubles and discoveries. I'll be sure to share this one with my daughter and Mom. I'm looking forward to reading more by Laura Ruby.
4,Somewhat geared toward a younger audience but a good read and story line,"I really enjoyed the book and could easily relate to the characters. I would have like to see more development between Lilly and her young friend, but there again it was seemingly geared for a teen audience."
4,Good Characters,"Kept my interest throughout......the characters were interesting. Loved that it was set in Cape May and Philadelphia , since I live in Philadelphia."
3,lilys ghosts,"good book for teens but a little immature for adults. it was good reading though, would reccommend for light reading"
5,Lilly's Ghosts,I love reading ghosts stories and this was a very well written and easy read. It was entertaining and caught my interest from the beginning. Love when a book grabs you from the moment you start reading it...
5,My Favorite Ghosts,"This was the best book I've ever read! I never read, and I could not put down the book after I started it. Uncle Max seemed so scary at first. I loved the crazy teenage ghost who tried so hard to ruin the relationship between Lily and Vaz."
5,A great read,"If you liked ""Johnny Got His Gun"" by Trumbo you'll be less depressed reading this interesting tale. The book is based on a real former military hospital in Narssarsuaq, whose ruins I walked through in the mid-70s. But that was a WWII facility, and not really the Korean War unit of this book. (Search Narssarsuaq on the Net for more insight). Truth aside, this amusing tale does in fact invoke M*A*S*H and Catch-22, and will be especially enjoyed by servicemen/women who have served in some of Uncle Sam's godawful remote outposts."
1,Improbable fiction can mislead you about southern Greenland,"If you want a page turner this isn't altogether bad. But if you're looking to educate yourself about Greenland, you might end up confusing yourself by some of the incongruous settings that pop up in this hollywoodian fiction. Notably, don't expect to find polar bears at Narsarsuaq (the real life airbase on which this book is very loosely based)."
3,not all that great,"i dont know what it is... the quality, or design. It looks cheap . i almost never use it. waste of my money :("
3,comfortable once you finally get your feet in,"No wonder why they were only 4 bucks or so. It is obvious that the designer/maker, whatever NEVER tried this shoe on. After aq long struggle to get my foot in, the shoe is not that bad, but I don't think anyone is in the mood for this. The thing is that these shoes have no lace, so they're completely closed and have some elastic material that is supposed to ease your feet into it. BUT that is not the case, you literally have to fight with the shoe. O boy!"
5,Very comfortable and stylish,"These are my new favorite sneakers. They are very comfortable and fit well-tight enough to stay on, but not so tight they are uncomfortable. I can wear these all day and be comfortable. The colors go well with olive, gray, and khaki shorts. They were a steal on clearance but are well worth paying regular price."
4,Looks huge on foot,"These shoes are slip-on style but is hard to put on, so I cut the last elastic band closure and now I can easily wear them. There is one more thing. I wear size 10, and they look huge with skinning leg jeans, or with skirt. But they are fine with straight leg or bootcut jeans."
4,Something Different!!,"Tavern In The Morning was my first read of a medieval mystery and I truly enjoyed it. Well plotted, moves right along and is direct and to the point. Really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more from Ms. Clare."
4,Electrolyte Supplement Rated,Taking these tablets twice a day has helped to eliminate my husband's leg cramps. He had a serious problem waking up during the night in severe pain. He has now controlled these cramps with the use of the Trace Minerals supplement.
2,OK unless you reach the expiration date,"I've used this product for many years, only in the summertime, since I work outside. This year I began taking it, and noticed a headache, and stomach upset, and the sense my system is trying to rid itself of toxins of some sort. Woke up in the morning with a headache and have had it through the day. Checked the expiration date on my bottle, which is 10/11. Since the product has deteriorated, and passed its expiration date, is it possible that the only remaining substances that haven't deteriorated are the toxic heavy metals? The symptoms certainly point to this. After reading the one reviewers comments about the contaminants, it seems to click for me. Think I'll look for something else for electrolyte replacement."
3,Meh,"I used these during a nine week hot yoga training where I was sweating profusely for ~4 hours a day. I took them for the first few weeks (felt fine) and then stopped taking them (still felt fine). So I'm not sure they helped but its quite possible my diet contained sufficient electrolyte replenishment. That being said, they certainly didn't hurt."
2,Great Salt Lake,I was excited about this until I read they get the salt from the great salt lake in Utah...that lake is a little too polluted for me eat...maybe they purify the salt somehow...
3,I really don't use it much,I'm afraid this takes up space in my drawer. It is fiddly to close after inserting the knife and I rarely take the time to use it. It's probably a useful product if used.
2,Leaves Rubber Marks on the Knife :(,"Beware... This product will leave dark stains on your knife...I put the knife in the case for just one hour before I noticed the marks... it took a few minutes to wash off... Luckly I did not leave it in the case overnight... I think it would have been permeant... I would use this product only for old knifes not your nice ones... I am thinking of trying the Magnet sleave made by the same company... you get what you paid for with this product... Great design but horrible rubber docks... ""maybe you must wash them clean before use"" I won't dare test my knife again unless I wrap it up with a cloth... :("
4,"Fits, but not a perfect fit","8"" Knife fits in holder. I wanted a case rather than a magnetic sleeve. It's not snug and a little loose, but it does the job of protecting the blade and making it easier to transport."
3,Cheap Plastic !,"The plastic material used for the case is extreamly brittle and breaks easily.Knives with any curve to them are not held as securly as a straight blade knife.If you have a 8-10 inch straight blade knife and its not going to get bounced around at all while in storage,get this holder.Otherwise,keep looking."
4,Does the Job but Bulky,"I bought this protective sheath for my new Victorinox Ceramic 7"" Santoku kitchen knife. Being ceramic, I figured this knife needs all the protection I can give it.The BladeSafe seems to do the job rather well although it is a bit bulky and a bit tricky to open. I like the little rubber pads inside that securely hold the blade in place. Really, there's not a lot that can be said about this item, but it is a very functional kitchen device."
4,Protects my bread knife,I now have knife blade protection on all my knives. I won't even tell you the silly reason I had covers for all my knives except my recently-acquired bread knife. This cover does exactly what it is designed to do. No complaints.
1,Extra Cleaning Involved....,"I purchased this item with an 8"" Victorinox Chef's knife. The knife fits in the protective sleeve just fine and is very secure. This product has two black 'rubber' items to hold the knife securely in place. Unfortunately when you take the knife out of this product there are black marks on your knife. Therefore you have to actually clean the knife before you use it in order to get these marks off. And they do not easily wipe off...you have to scrub with a reasonable amount of force to get the knife clean. I would not purchase this item again and will probably not use it for home use."
4,A Best Value,"I bought this for my girlfriend, since I had given her an 8"" Victorinox chef's knife for Christmas. The BladeSafe protects the blade during drawer storage. It's a little stiff opening, but that should improve with use.In my early 20s I bought a good set of Solengen cutlery on a trip to Germany, but stored it in a drawer and really abused it. Later I got a set of Chicago Cutlery in a wooden block and those knives are still serving after 30 years. My honey is not a knife block kind of person, so this will protect her first good knife. Highly recommended."
5,works fine,"does what it is intended to do. I do not use it that much. It guards my ""fancy"" knife for special occasions. I would buy again if needed."
5,Great product,It offers plenty of room for my 5-in chef knife and would be a perfect fit for a bigger blade as advertised. A great deal for a quality product! The two rubber stoppers stablize the blade from shifting.
2,i could have got something better,i was so disappointed to buy this product.for the following reason:1. its too bulky2. my 9 inch boning knife slips through the rubber making bladesafe unsafe in my case3. I think the other brand was way better than this.
3,Disappointed.,"It doesn't actually hold my knife in. I'm able to slide it out without opening the case. I bought four, different sizes."
5,Wouldn't live without it now,I have a Henckel knife block set that the knives are ok but I wanted a knice santoku. So I bought a wusthof without thinking how I would store it. Then I found this and it's awesome.
3,Victorinox Cutlery BladeSafe,"I guess it's OK for regular knives, but I was disappointed because I bought this product for a 7"" Santoku, but the knife doesn't fit in the sheath."
4,"Little Large for 8"" knife...Excellent Quality","Little Large for 8"" knife...Excellent QualityAfter reviewing Victorinox Cutlery BladeSafe for 8-to-10-Inch Knife Blades we are going to order one for our other lose knifes. Saves the blade and your hand"
4,"Good, But I wouldn't use it for thin blades or knives shorter than 10 inches...","I bought some of these for my chef knives and my santoku. It holds my 10 inch chef knife beautifully, but not my 8 inch knife or even thinner 8 inch santoku.The 8 inch knife can slip out with little effort. The heel of the santoku holds it inside the case, but it rattles around a lot, so I don't trust it to keep my edge true.But the ones labeled ""For 6 to 8 inch knives"" holds them very well. So this case is only effective for 10 inch chef knives. I ended up returning the other case.So even though this says ""For 8 to 10 inch knives,"" buy their ""6 to 8 inch knives"" for knives of 8 inches or lower.So once again, DO NOT USE THIS FOR KNIVES OF 8 INCHES OR LESS (Get the smaller ones, they work great for those) OR VERY THIN BLADES like a boning or filet knife, and this is ONLY EFFECTIVE for 10 inch CHEF knives.But still, great product if used for what it's designed for."
4,This is great.,"this thing works wonders for my OXO 8'' CHEF KNIFE. I got the 8-10 inch case to ensure i have enough room. I do not have a conventional knife block or other knives for cooking. It keeps the knife and my fingers in one piece. The only con is, the rubber numbers smudge the knife after I clean it and needs further wiping when i remove the knife for the next use. locks up well, light, ergonomic, overall a very nice kitchen tool to have. I traveled with it, and the TSA, did say anything."
5,Works for Kyocera 5 inch ceramic slicing knife,Just wanted to let anyone interested to know that this item works with the Kyocera 5 inch ceramic slicing knife. I love having the knife safely stored in the drawer.
3,Works for me,"I have no pluses or negatives for this sheath, I'll use it while on adventures to keep from injurying anyone during the travels. It looks like it'll do the job. What more can you ask."
5,Wow,"Very sharp knife...i have expensive knifes, but this has a much sharper and precise blade. Have given a few for gifts, and everyone really enjoys them."
5,great buy,"This knife is the best i ever had, very sharp and easy to usewill order every size.Victorinox 47520 Fibrox 8-Inch Chef's Knife"
4,GREAT COVER FOR MY CHEFS KNIFE,THIS IS A GOOD INVESTMENT TO PROTECT YOUR CHEFS KNIFE FROM DAMAGE OR FROM DAMAGING YOU WHEN YOU HAVE IT IN THE DRAWER. IT IS A LITTLE ON THE BULKY SIDE OR IT WOULD HAVE RECEIVED 5 STARS.
4,Heart-breaker for parents,"A short and quickly read book, and perhaps not one which you could cope with at all stages in your life, this is the brief account (kind of parallels the brief life) of the last year of life of a 32 year old London journalist who discovers she has cancer - and the news rapidly gets worse and worse. A collection of her emails (sent and received), some pieces she wrote for the newspaper, and text from her husband, this really tells it how it is (or was) for them. Few euphemisms, and the heart-breaking fact for any parent reading the book that she left behind her twin children (conceived through IVF), who celebrated their 2nd birthday just a few weeks before her death. Good for gaining a basic understanding of what she went through and some empathy for any friends or family you may want to support at such times in the future."
4,Etta James Rocks The House,Covers great selection of original oldie R&R with her own R&B touch & sound !! Makes you want to sing and dance !
5,THIS IS THE A-BOMB!!,"This album is the best album I own, and I own a lot of music. If you don't love the emotion, intensity, and power of this than nothing can move you."
3,Mostly word games,"Most of the puzzles are word-oriented. Compared to a traditional Mensa-style puzzle book, it's not very well-rounded."
1,Zero Stars. Worse book EVAR!!!1,"The fisrt 60 pages of this book are worthless. Chances are the reader understands the parts of a PC and understands the abstracts of how each piece talks to eachother. Unusable examples. Poor course structure. Why waster paper to include a datasheet? The first real project is overly complex and it suggested you use a prototyping board and not a bread board. I'm not sure who this book is written for, but it is not a very good introduction to the Pic.If you are a beginner to PIC programming who understands basic electronics, there are far better tutorials online for free. Just dont buy this book, because it is worthless."
5,The Wines of the Northern Rhone,"Every serious wine lover will find The Wines of the Northern Rhone indispensable. It is profound in its knowledge of the soil, grape, vineyard, and the wine makers of the Rhone. John Livingstone-Learmonth's writing is lucid and sensitive. It is not only a scholarly study of reference but also one that will be consulted to select a wine for dinner, for purchase and for cellaring. It is also a wonderful tourist guide of the northern Rhone valley.Herbert H. KaplanPhiladelphia"
5,A great way to start a daily spiritual practice,"This book is a wonderful help to those who want to start a daily Christian practice, as well as for those who want to deepen their spiritual lives. The four-week program of spiritual reading and reflection is full of provocative scripture and poetry, and lots of helpful options for praying--such as chanting, or drawing, as well as the more ""traditional"" options most people know of. The writing and suggestions are inviting, rather than demanding, and focus not only on what you read, but how you will respond to it. This is an enormously helpful workbook for individuals, study groups, and congregations."
3,From the back cover:,"The City: San Francisco, CaliforniaThe Single: Desperate but determined computer geek Marnie LaTourThe Solution: The SkirtAfter the guy she thinks she's dating tells her she's not girlfirend material, Marnie LaTour decides to make some changes. She's going to learn how to be a femme fatale - or else. Only, attracting guys isn't as tough as she thinks. Especially when she's wearing the skirt her landlady swears works like a man magnet. And it sure isn't long before rugged construction worker Zack Renfrew finds himself under the influence.Single in the City - It's a dating wasteland out there!"
2,Very poor quality,"I got these earrings and as soon as i tried to take them out of the package they bent all over the place. i tried straghtening it out, big mistake, and they only got worse. Do not get these, they look pretty, but they are a very flimsy pair of earrings."
2,earrings,Ok but alot larger thean I thought they would be. Think I will give them as a gift this Christmas.
4,Good value for short $,"This telescope is a good value for the money, and is of quite decent quality for the relatively small cash outlay. It includes a useful selection of eyepieces and sturdy construction (as telescopes go) and the image quality is good. I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter and she's thrilled to pieces with it. It could be too advance for a young child, I'd recommend age 8 and up, with some parental help needed for those under 12 or so"
2,"OK Scope, Lousy Legs","Scope was OK for the money, but I'd only recommend it for kids over 12 years old. Set up time took a while even with parents help. Scope parts loosened easily with normal use and made viewing jittery at best detracting from the beauty and fun. The tripod it came with met with an accident and I tried in vain for weeks to get a replacement...no luck. Because of the unique tripod mount, no other tripod that I've found will work with this scope. The eduscience website is absolutely no help. I now have a scope that is gathering a lot of dust in my basement. Bottom line is that if anything breaks on this, you might as well buy a new one. If I had to do it all again, I wouldn't."
1,Could not se a thing,"Never could get the darn thing to work, manual was usless.I'll I could see was the unit holding the reflector for the eye piece."
4,Not as bad as others have reviewed it to be.,"I purchased this for my 8yr. old son for Christmas and he really enjoys it. The only advice I can give is to make sure everything is tightened well and to make the correct adjustments to your finderscope so that is will be useful to you. It's a great 1st telescope. If my son is still interested in exploring the universe by next Christmas then I would consider buying a higher quality one for him. In considereing the low cost of this telescope, I do think it is a great value."
1,Unusable,"The best telescopes are good for perhaps 50x of magnification per inch of aperture. That implies this scope should deliver, under ideal conditions, 150x. Whoever packaged it with eyepieces designed to deliver 600x obviously never tried to use it. This is the kind of junk that discourages children- and adults- from astronomy."
2,Nice starter scope,Get this if you are new to astronomy. It is a good scope except for the tripod. The plastic that holds the legs apart breaks after a while.
1,"Failed to work ""out of the box""","I thought that buying a re-manufactured product would not only save some money, but that it would also yield a product that was in working order when it arrived. I was wrong and I would advise anyone to steer clear of Phillips re-manufactured products. I have not had similar problems with our factory reconditioned products from other companies (Sharp TV's and Dell computers to name two of them). Amazon was good about picking up the return and their refund was prompt."
2,ok product,I ended up returning this item as it didn't fit my needs. I felt I could find the information in a basic corporate finance book or other books that I own and many of the question can be found in other less expensive books or on the internet.
5,Recommendation: buy,This book contains many problems that can help develop your analytical thought process. Recommendation: Buy!
1,INTECH Golf Travel Cover with Wheels,did not met my expectations because it looks different with respect to the photo displayed in the box. INTECH Golf Travel Cover with Wheels
4,Intech Golf Travel Cover with wheels.,Very pleased with the Intech Golf Travel bag. Definitely happy with the wheels. Would not have liked to travel having to lug around the total weight of my club. Did wish there was a little more padding at the top end of the bag. Ended up wrapping towel aroung the top of my clubs to protect them a little more.
1,Disposable Travel Case,"The material is decent quality, but it is assembled very poorly. The bottom completely shredded apart during its first use along the seems. Returned for refund..."
2,Ripped after first use,"I liked the look and utility of this bag. It holds my clubs, plus shoes and other items. Unfortunately, it had a large rip at the bottom seam after just one round trip. I am surprised the company doesn't reinforce the seams that are most likely to break. It is after all, a travel bag, and subject to rough treatment by the airlines."
4,Good value for the price!,Product does the job. Good product for a medium priced unit. I have used it on several trips and no damage experienced.
2,Tore apart,"My bad tore apart the very FIRST time we used it to transport my golf clubs. Luckily amazon replaced it, but I will see if the second go round is any better."
1,Weak construction,"I purchased this product for recent golf trip. To my dismay, the bag ripped when simply carrying it by the supplied shoulder strap from the house to the car on the way to the airport.My brother in law had suggested another brand name bag for the same price which he had used for years but I opted for this bag just because I trusted the website.If you are in the market for a golf travel bag, I would consider other products before this one due to the thin/weak material used in it's construction."
4,Good purchase for cost,"I read several of the reviews on this bag and for the most part, they all said it was a good travel bag for the money. I purchased this since I did not want to have to worry about my clubs on a previous trip. The bag has so much room. I was able to fit my clubs, shoes, extra box of golf balls and a few extra towels. I ship my clubs using Fedex since I am a retiree. The clubs arrived at my location without any issues to the bag. I also shipped them back home again and still no issues. Very Good bag for the money."
2,"second one I bought, but this one ripped on first use","I had bought this item for my husband a couple years ago, and he's travelled with his clubs about 10 times since...some minor nicks and picks, but it's held up well. so i ordered one for myself for an upcoming trip. it ripped on our return trip so now i'm having to duct tape it back together...not pleased with it, though I guess that's what I get for the money."
2,At least my golf clubs survived.,"The bag did not make it back in one piece from it's maiden voyage. The bag was ripped at the seam. I am sure the airline was not gentle, but it is a golf ""travel"" bag. Such handling should be expected. No refund and no word from the airline yet. The clubs made it home in good condition though. They survived to play another day...the bag did not.Hard cover will be my next purchase."
5,Superb hisory writing,"Over the past fifty years I have read several histories dealing with the early history of paleontology and geology. This is by far the most readable and interesting book on the subject that I have ever encountered. Instead of only relating the finds by well known early fossil collectors and moving in a progression from one to another, the author places them in the context of the history of the times and their relation to one another. It is a fascinating saga of people and their discoveries in an easy to read style with excellent documentation.Anyone interested in the subject shoud not overlook this book!"
3,GREAT CD 2 LISTEN!,"I THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT CD! THE SONG ""FEELIN' SO GOOD"" HAS A GOOD R&B FLAVOR TO IT. WHAT MAKES THIS CD EVEN BETTER IS THE REMIX VERSION OF ""WAITING FOR TONIGHT"". THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST DANCE MIXES I HAVE EVER HEARD. IF YOU WANT A COOL SINGLE GET THIS ONES FOR YOU!"
4,it's good to hear moms again.,"Years ago my parents had the LP of Moms Mabley, and she was hilarious then and she is hilarious now. The LP was stolen and after researching for the LP and price problems I saw it on Amazon. Thank You!! Amazon and the reseller that I brought the cassette from you guys are the best. My listening enjoyment had been restored!!! Keep up the great work."
4,Pleased,I was very pleased with this buying experience. The product arrived quickly. The only problem I had was the original record had Mom's singing songs (paradies) and all the music was taken out.
3,Barely sufficient for beginners.,"The Haynes' assume you know too much. They leave out certain important details on occasion and don't always identify all the parts they talk about with a diagram. If I wasn't already somewhat familiar with some of the terminology, in many cases I wouldn't have (and sometimes didn't) know what in the heck they were talking about. Really what is needed is a narrower scope and more than one book on the Sprite/Midgets. If you are serious about working on your Spridget, get a more complete official manual (hint). I won't be rude and say what the book is in this review, but Amazon carries this better one too."
5,MAJESTIC!!,"The man pours his heart and soul into twelve soaring songs of inspiration and I am the one left breathless and with a lump in my throat. This album is a blessing. One may as well call ""An American Hymn"" Daniel Rodriguez's Hymn. The lyrics say it all about this man, the true American tenor, who has traveled through America and beyond sharing his gift. He is truly at home on stage.""I've seen the silver mountain topsAnd golden prairies on my wayNow everywhere I go across the landI stand so proudly in the sun and sayI am homeI've dreamed of eden all my lifeI find it more and more each dayNow everywhere I go across the landI stand so proudly in the sun and sayI am home ""I have dreamt of a musical eden all my life and I have found it in Daniel Rodriguez."
4,Every one should hear this guy sing.,"The first time I heard Daniel Rodriguez sing, was at all those funeral services after 9/11.This New York police officer has a beautiful voice. This is his third album. ""In The Presence"" I love the song An American Hymm.The other songs are good too. Give it a try you will love it."
5,Daniel Rodriquez,I've heard Daniel sing for the first time in the cristal cathedral and was instantly grapped with his wonderful voice
5,In His Presence,I loved his rendering of old and new songs. He sings with emotion and motivation. It was like a love-feast to my ears.
2,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed with this camera. It does not take good pictures, has alot of lighting issues and the batteries do not stay charged. As a matter of fact, I ended up purchasing a Kodak 710 after christmas to replace this camera."
2,Nikon Coopix 7600,"I loved the camera - easy to use and fast processing. However after 6 months I starting getting ""LENS ERROR"" messages and the camera stopped taking pictures. Nikon said they would charge me $100-150 to fix so I don't think it's worth it. I have had better luck with my Pentax. I guess that's why Nikon stopped making these models after about a year."
5,Good to Read!,"As with anything by Harris, a thoroughly enjoyable read. It is mind-boggling that Harris's work and his cultural materialist theories are not better known than the sociobiological garbage so beloved of the media and academia these days. In spite of the sociobio claims that virtually anything that humans do is based on genetics, Harris consistently trumps their arguments with examples of the variability of cultural beliefs, from refusing to eat foods because the gods don't want us to, to beliefs that perfectly edible foods are disgusting, to the belief that the gods want us to eat human flesh. And he demonstrates how all that talk about the food preferences of the gods is really a smokescreen for (originally) practical survival issues."
4,Still Sardonic After All There Years,"After 15 years, Chumbawamba can still hammer out biting social commentary that you can dance to. Tracks 2 and 3 here are forgettable, but ""Friends"" is infectious. This version features Dunst rather than Alice. Also, ""Passenger"" is worth the price alone. Riotous!"
5,She's Got All the Friends that Money Can Buy and its songs,"the sessions to She's Got All the Friends that Money Can Buy are fun and comedic, but in great taste and respect to music and disrespect to those who deserve no respect. the single is fantastic, i believe Pink may have had inspiration to write/sing ""Stupid Girls"" from ""She's Got All the Friends that Money Can Buy"". ""Just a Form of Music"" is funny but serious at the end of the song and is quite catchy to bop your head to. ""Lest We Forget"" is an eerie catchy song that is quite misunderstood at times. ""Passenger List for Doomed Flight #1721"" is one of the greatest ""earworm"" songs, it provides a groovy track to listen and dance and shout and sing to. this CD single is highly recommended."
1,not that great!,"Even though there is a picture you would assume that the ""volleyball set"" would have a VOLLEYBALL. We unpacked and were ready for play but there was no ball. Also, there was a piece missing that was necessary to stabilize the poles. Not satisfactory at all!"
4,Good for the price,"This works well, especially for the price. We needed to do a little bit of gerry-rigging but it was easy to put up, lasted all season and is still in fine shape for this season."
3,Ok,"Shipped quickly, quality is not great. There are some hand tied knots in the net & seam along bottom isn't attached all the way. Ok for the money"
1,Save your money,"KT900 3-Light 1250-Watt Mini-Boom KitThis kit should be an embarrassment for Smith-Victor. I decided to purchase this expecting it to be entry level equipment. It is not. I have seen SV lights and expected a modest version of their equipment. The stands may qualify. They are functional. However the rest of this kit is garbage. The lights are nothing more than shop lights from any home store painted black. I would be very surprised if they are rated for the 500W 0r 250W bulbs which are included. Those bulbs burnt out within 5 minutes of operation.I would recommend you take your money and buy one decent $200-$250 light, rather than waste your money on this kit. I have purchased items online for over 10 years. This is the most disappointing product I have ever seen. I am getting a RA from Adorama to return.I am also a little upset with Adorama as a result. I don't expect a ocmpany with their reputation to sell products this cheesy."
2,You get what you pay for,"The construction is chinsey... NOT portable like it is promoted. Yes, you CAN take it with you, but if a subject sneezes, the boom light falls over. The light stands are very flimsy, and were difficult to assemble (no instructions).Produces decent light, but I wish I would have saved my pennies and bought a more professional version of lighting. Honestly, that's what I would recommend... make the jump to the higher price point, you'll regret starting with such a BASIC and CHEAP set."
3,Good lighting - bad constructions,"This kit produces great lighting once set up but the construction could be higher quality for the same low price in my opinion.I got the kit and it only contained instructions for the boom assembly for the hair-light, nothing for the confusing ball joints that hold the light fixtures. After figuring out how to assemble these, they are just okay. Occasionally I want a certain angle and the ball head joints cant support the light fixture once the umbrella is open.The tripod style light stands themselves are decent quality.Smith-Victor needs some quality control in their packaging department to make sure all instructions are there. Reading other reviews mentions their terrible customer service.I ordered this from Amazon via Adorama Camera. Both Amazon and Adorama are EXCELLENT to deal with and will continue to do business with them."
1,BUY A STROBE INSTEAD,These are TUNGSTEN LIGHTS which are no good to most studio lighting entrepreneurs. It will give the wrong colors for people who want accurate lighting techniques. Adorama is a great company to work with but this product is a waste of money for photographers who want to get on their feet. Get a strobe instead for all your lighting needs! I switched to strobes immediately after I bought this product and have had an amazing difference. Strobes are way better!
3,"It's okay, BUT...",I purchased this light kit to serve as a full-time travel kit for my photography business. The carrying kit is awesome because it's a hard-case on wheels. Gotta love that! The downside to this is the mini-boom is not the easiest to put together. It doesn't quite fit on the tri-pod as tightly as I would like it to fit. It swivels a lot if you're not careful. Overall a nice kit if you're looking to leave it in a studio for 3-point lighting. Price is right if you're just starting out and you are looking for a cheap way to light in a small studio.
5,Exactly What I Needed at A Price I Needed It for!,"I was very happy with the product. It serves me well. Fast delivery, good service by the vender. I got the project done and it will serve me well on into the future. Great travel storage case, Heavy plastic unit.Good quality light stands."
5,Everything I wanted,The Smith Victor KT900 light set has met all my needs. I am an inspiring photographer and this kit opened a whole new dimension to my work.
1,Depressing!,"I was hoping this would be a great, fun read. Well, it's neither great nor fun. At first you're rooting for Teri Carter, the supposed ""heroine"" of the story. But she's self-absorbed and full of selfish motives. Jamie is no better. He's a liar and a cheat, twisting reality in his favor. His wife has been nothing but good to him, trying everything she can to save her family and love life. The book is told from all three perspectives, and the only person you actually can root for gets the bad end of it. It's a depressing and grim tale of how relationships can go wrong, and how a wonderful life is seen as something you ""make do"" with while your dreams get crushed under the train rails. It saddens me. I want to burn the book, I wish I'd never read it."
1,Another tragic airport pickup,"It happened again. At the airport and nothing to read, two minutes to catch my flight so I hurry through the bookstore...which unfortunately leaves me stuck on a four hour flight with this awful book.I kept waiting and waiting for the characters to become likeable, or in any way sympathetic. None of them. They were all hateful, and when you hate all the co-protagonists, the only way you're going to enjoy the book is if everyone gets their comeuppance. And SPOILER! It doesn't happen.Save your time and your thirteen bucks this time, guys. I only hope the author isn't as souless as the characters in her book."
1,Don't waste your time or money.......,"I loved the first Carole Matthews novel I read, ""For Better or Worse"", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. It kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight, but only because I didnt' have anything else to do. I am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane.I totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. There were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. To me, Matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. I think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage.If you want to read something good, pick up a Jane Green novel instead."
3,Let's not!,"More serious a storyline than appeared. Teri meets Jamie while they are commuting and finds out he's married. She OBVIOUSLY is upset but then keeps seeing him. The book lost me. If Matthews had made the guy single, I think it would have been more likeable a story for me. The ending did agree with me though."
2,Dissapointing,"I loved ""For Better, For Worse"" and I couldn't wait to read another book by Carol Matthews. Unfortunately this book lacked all the laugh out loud lines that the previous book I read was full of!I felt like the author was trying to convince the reader that it was OK if the husband, Jamie, cheated as long as he really loved his mistress and wasn't abandoning his children.I really thought the book was awful and the best part of it was the last page."
5,Nice sign,Well made. Colors are strong. Heavy duty metal not too flimsy. Looks good in my garage. Do not regret purchasing one bit
4,magic and meaning and nature,"This book deals with the depth and power of Ted Hughes writing in a way which is readable, yet sufficiently technical to highlight the mechanisms being used. It draws on French theorists, notable Lacan and Kristeva, to expose the poems as being ultimately a search for meaning amongst an ostensibly wild and natural universe. The themes of myth and magic run deep through the book in a manner which matches Hughes' style very closely. I would recommend this book to all who are interested in looking more deeply at this poet's work."
5,Works great,Its the best stuff for conditioning a leather toneau cover. It's what I've used for 10 years now. I've tried others because I don't like having to order this all the time but nothing else works as well.
3,"Not bad, but..","...it could be a lot better. The characters are of some interest, but the premise and plot are highly derivative.Reading the book was made fairly unpleasant for me by the incredibly bad proofreading, which I suspect was done with a spellchecker. If an actual human being did the proofreading, he or she does not have English as a first language.While I did not count the actual number of proofreading errors, it exceeded one per page. In a 306 page book, that's a hell of a lot of errors. Another annoying aspect of reading the book was the amateurish use of the justification option in what looks like an MS Word document. It results in very uneven letter spacing and in the completely unsatisfactory result of several chapters which end with only one or two words on a page.I would be embarassed to be associated with the production of this book."
1,HORRID & BADLY WRITTEN TRITE,"I bought this book after reading the first 2-3 pages and thought it would be pretty good romance/ urban fantasy. I was incredibly wrong. I finished the book out of pure perversity but I couldn't enjoy it. It was a basic rip-off of the Buffy universe -- only a pathetic attempt at creating such an interesting world. There was little tension: romantic or other wise. The characters were basically flat. AND there were so many misspelled words and poorly written sentences that I found myself re-reading passages slowly to be sure I knew who was speaking and what was going on. I hate writing bad reviews, but this one merited it. Save your money for a good urban fantasy."
2,Skip it!!,All I can say about this book is mix Buffy with Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series (or at least the first six books before those turned to porn as well!!) and you've got this. Is the author even trying???
5,Great and inforative book,"The book featured my boyfriend's motorcycle in it, great book and useful for the sale of this bike."
3,my comment,The name is a 3 in 1 boxwave only problem is the picture shows a screen protector and a belt clip all i got was one piece to go over the phone and for that price it wasn't worth it.
2,nah,plastic part looks too cheap in person...thank you anyway ....rubber part was awesome though..shame that thet did not match up
1,Not satisfied,"Completely unsatisfied with purchase. Item does not cover phone properly, when put the first rubber cover on....no problem, but when you put hard plastic case on-it pulls the rubber and rolls the rubber onto the phone screen. I had several people try it, they all said to return this garbage"
2,"Outdated, I don't recommend it.","Well.... this dictionary needs an update badly. The volume of vocabulary is sufficient enough, but it needs a major overhaul in words, definitions. Cassells has a vast series of dictionaries; I don't know about other ones, but I don't recommend this Spanish dictionary. Try to choose another from the listings at this Amazon site."
4,More an essay than a broad introduction,"The author appears to write about those aspects of the subject that interest him, without intending to give a broad introduction to Byzantium. In fact, many topics, such as Charlemagne and Norman Sicily, which are not strictly Byzantine, are coverd at some length. The major focus of the Byzantine material itself is Iconoclasm. So while the book is very readable, and without footnotes, it is probably not the best first book on Byzantium for the general reader, but better suited to those who already have some background and want to learn more about the topics covered. Included are four maps, and a large section of black-and-white plates, most being photos of things religious."
3,Okay...has its moments.,"As aforementioned, this book is largely a study of ecclesiastical history from the time of Justinian through the early Macedonian dynasty. Rather dry in parts even for a history text, and somewhat uneven, it nevertheless contains some good research and interesting conclusions.Also, as someone else said, don't be fooled by the title: this is not a broad, introductory text. To be fair though, by his own admission the author states that Byzantine history is largely a history of Constantinople, so perhaps it should be judged on its own ground."
5,not quite what is pictured,"Death and his Dog are great, but the one I recieved has a skull head instead of a mask. other than that its Great."
5,excellent exposition of Genesis,"Hughes has hit a homerun, or at least a triple. This exposition of Genesis is amazing in its scope, depth, and clarity.Hughes is definitely in his prime here.While Hughes is not a six day Creationist, he does espouse Creationism. He does a good job of upholding special Creation as he writes.Hughes has an amazing knowledge of Scripture as well as background resources. All of these are brought to bear on the subject at hand. The book has extensive references. The writing is good, too.""Genesis: Beginning and Blessing"" is certainly a recommended resource for studies in the book of Genesis.I dare say that ""Genesis: Beginning and Blessing"" shall become one of the few classic expositions of the book of Genesis.Whether one is a layman, Bible class teacher, pastor, or scholar, ""Genesis: Beginning and Blessing"" belongs in their library."
4,Screamo-core; Not For Radio,"The Killing Moon have a long way to go before they become a chart topping hard rock band - they are just too loud and too mean for popular radio. This is screamo-core: provocative rock and roll that draws upon hardcore of the Tuff McGruff variety and upon elements of melodic rock, then escalates the intensity of the melodi-core with winds and horns. Hardcore fans will love this and probably give it a 5! There are moments, however, when Ryan Hannan's screamo-voice indicates his potential for radioable vocals. That said, if you like hardcore, you'll love The Killing Moon. Fans will find these tracks to be creative and catchy. This genre was just too noisy for my ears - and unable to block out the screams, I quickly dissected my Walkman."
5,Loved it!!!,"I heard a song from this album on the Jazz station, loved it. Searched for it and bought it. Love it!!!!"
4,Family Classics,Solidly woven classics will always pass the time test. Fresh today means same in two years or two generations. My Father's Glory and its sequel are recommended in movie venue to family of all life ages. Target audience for youthful enrichment would be range of grade school age through sixth. Teachers of a mind set certainly expand on this in any direction. Viewers carry these memories forward to their families to come; joy with importance indeed.
3,"A good novel, not a great one.","One Of Us is both a fascinating read and a disappointing story. The British Colonial world that is long gone has been evocatively and lovingly recreated. The author was able to bring the reader back to pre-WWII Egypt with all its sights, sounds and smells. The story is an intriguing love quadrangle, played out against the decline of England's hold on its colonies. And while there are some very funning and rich passages, the story feels slight and the characters thinly drawn. A deeper delving into the characters motivations (other than patriotism, ego and lust) would have been enough to make this a great novel. Instead it's only a good one."
5,Proof that men should NOT send women greeting cards!,"Instead, buy NOTECARDS, and write the message yourself. It'll be perceived as SO-much-more-thoughtful and personal...and your choice of the notecard itself SHARES something personal with the recipient. That's what I come away from Campbell's book understanding...because it takes a TOUGH guy to share as much as he does in this collection of such personal, yet relatable, stories. Campbell's poetry shatters the myth of macho, and should encourage all self-styled tough guys with feelings and stories to just spit-it-out."
1,"As A Work of Fiction it's Good, But...","...unfortunately it claims to be a true account. I corresponded with the author shortly before the book came out in the hope some of my questions could be answered, but was I saw what she wrote she was unable to justify her conclusions. Her main theory is that McGurn's father changed his name to that of McGurn's wife. Didn't make sense to me either. Not only that, but Demora (or Demory) was not even her maiden name. If she were to re-release this as a romance novel (while correcting her geographical and historical errors), this might have a chance. For now, especially considering the expense, it's just not worth it."
5,everyone liked it,"i got thebook and i read it in two days and lo ned it to a friend who loaned it to a friend and so on and so on, i haven't gotten it back becaujse its so good."
2,Horrible Remastering! Disappointing Performance!,"This recording represents one of the worst remasterings of a stereo, studio recording on a major label that I've ever heard. The treble is shrill and crackly from start to finish. It's almost unbearable!Further, Barenboim seems not to have the part under his fingers throughout: his playing is often so sloppy as to give the impression that he was not only sightreading but also drunk or stoned or something."
1,Ho Humm,"This book is about statistics, regression analysis, and other boring subjects. If you like reading tables of numbers you might like it but since it was written after much numbers research be prepared for the ho-humm. It is one of the few books on this subject I could not finish---I have read over 65 books on the subject."
3,Who is the artist on the first track?,I would like to find more music like track one...can anyone tell me who this artist is? or if this track is on another CD somewhere?
1,witchcraft knockoff of voodoo,To the person that said something about NO voodoo is an african belief aka religion which is where the euros got witchcraft from blacks get back into your own religions and leave christianity alone dont buy a book that says voodoo for dummies because as an african you are not dumb
1,Took nearly a month to get the book!,"i ordered and paid for the book on Jan 5 and selected 5-7day shippingon Jan 10 i got an email saying it had just been shipped.... so already 5 daysi then waited nearly 3.5 weeks to get the book, finally receiving it on Jan 29.Really sucked for me as i needed the book for research for my job as a tour guide as i had a private tour requesting information on voodoo on Jan 20. Guess this purchase didn't help my cause, I ended up buying the same book from a store as i could not wait any longer."
4,Good information,Good book for someone wanting to learn the basic ABC of this fascinating and interesting relegion a lot of good information
2,Not a Good Source At All,"I was, for the most part, unimpressed with the information offered. A lot of it was really sensationalistic...something that would titilate the horror genre reader, but not for someone really searching the spiritual. I gave the book a 2, but that's probably because it deserves a 1 1/2. The fact that the author brought in all the horror movie stuff was really insulting to the religion. I'm not initiated into Vodou, but I have studied it for well over 20 years and I found this book insulting to a beautiful faith. It was a curiousity buy. I wanted to see how the author presented the topic in this type of format. I should have known better. She tried (and she ad libbed A LOT), but she really failed. I was the Idiot to read it."
3,Not very metal,"I was looking for Bestiary's ""The Murder Wheel"" when I found this, but I was a bit curious and gave a listen... I have to say I am quite impressed, very soothing. You should definately give this a listen, but I still like the metal band better."
5,Love the ongoing adventures of The Merrimack,"I took the time to reread the first book, then moved on to Wolf Star. The books just keep getting better. The character developement, and story was just wonderful. The anticipation of the next book is even better. Can't wait to see where the Merrimack is off to next."
4,Another Decent Space Opera ---Spoiler Free Review,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW.This book is a quick fun ride and not a bad follow up to book 1. Truth be told, you don't even really have to read book 1 to enjoy book 2.In any event, the author has a knack for making his characters 3-d and writing military-esque sci-fi. There is a feel to decent military sci-fi and many authors can't pull it off. This author can.The plot is decent and the pacing keeps you turning pages.Never really a dull moment and I look forward to the next book.The only downside is that there isn't a lot of ""meat"" to the plot and its a little on the thin side. Not in a bad way per say, there is more than enough there to keep you entertained. If you are expecting something on the scale of Peter F. Hamilton or Kevin J. Anderson then you are going to be disappointed.But, if you want a quick and fun ride then this is your book."
3,"Good read, trashy package","I bought this book based on the starred review it received from Publishers Weekly. True enough, the writing is above par for genre fiction. However, my enjoyment of the book is marred by the damaged hardcover edition I received. When I removed the dust cover from my ""brand new"" copy, I discovered what appears to be a piece of masking tape covering what appears to be a cut or break in the spine/ binding of the book. Once I opened it and read a few chapters, the book gapes open/ will not close flat. Shame on Daw books for foisting damaged copies on unsuspecting online buyers. Very tacky."
5,Great little knife,another great global knife. if your into sharp knives then this knife is a good start. the knife comes very sharp and after i hit it with my japanese whetstones i was able to shave my face dry with it (sounds scary!)
1,Product is not the one with the mesh eyes,"Not sure what i was expecting for 10$ but one image shows a black mesh screening in the eyes and mouth and the one i received just has 3 open holes which is the other picture. The eyes are largely oversize exposing a great deal of my skin, which contradicts the point of even wearing the mask to begin with. I was happy it arrived before deer season but now i am not happy it arrived at all. these are pretty much 2 different products listed as one, not sure if they just reach in a box and pick one randomly or what."
3,Different,"I ordered this item because on the photo it was shown that it has a green comuflage, but it in different coulours, it's brown!!!! despite of this I can use it for hunting and also it's good enough to get pleasure from hunting"
3,good but doesn't come with black mesh as shown in photo,"The face mask is good and maybe a little warm, but doesn't come with black mesh as shown in photo. One of the 2 photos posted show black mesh behind the mask, which is very helpful, especially when duck hunting."
4,Very Cool,"Got this for my 18 year old nephew who loves to hunt. Got it thinking it might be sort of a ""gag"" gift, but he absolutely LOVES it."
2,Cheap!,"Cheap, loose, will not last long at all. Will not buy again, should have got something else instead. I will probably never use this."
3,Be aware of the color,"The product is pretty much as described, but you need to be aware that the product picture is black and white, and does not show that the power cord coming down from the housing on the right side is actually a bright green. I'm going to keep the fixture for my kitchen island, but the color of the cord was a bit disapointing when I first took it out of the box."
3,Gengar is really cool Mewoth is dumb!,If you're pokemon fan you must get this! If you a collector you Must get this! But if your a kid watch out the Mewoth toys arms will fall off pretty soon if they are played with to much! Oh the other hand Gengar is the neatest pokmon is a battle-pack! It is made out of a sprcail purple plastic. It glows it the light and looks very neat. So if you love Gengar Buy this but don't beat up on Mewoth to much kids!
5,Pokemon Rules!,I collect all of the Pokemon action figures. This one was neat because Meowth (my favorite) was included! I really want to get the Kakuna and Beedrill set.
5,A fun and imaginative toy,"Kids will be delighted for hours with this innovative set of Pokemon figures. The battle discs that come with the figures allow a game to be played between friends. The pokeball enhances the fun of the toys. Meowth is in its cutesy pose, while Gengar is even more ghoulish as a transluscent figure. A fun toy at a discount price."
1,Disappointment for Pokemon Fan!!,"I bought this for my son who loves Pokemon. He thought they were o.k., but likes the bigger pokemon better. This toy is too small and too high priced."
3,You get what you pay for.,"This is a fun little set but it's not very durable, that being said you get what you pay for. My kids love it and for the price I can't complain, don't buy it if you're looking for something to last but if you don't mind a little wear and tear your kids will have a ball with it."
4,Good,My son has really enjoyed this play camp set. It is great for pretend camping. I will buy from this company again.
3,Kind of disappointed...,"I bought this for my 4 year old grandson. I was disappointed in the quality of this set. The frying pan didn't set on the little stove very well, the first aid box was hard to open as was the top for the canteen. The fork, knife, and spoon were hard to get out of the pocket tool holder. The best part of the kit was the lantern. All in all, this is made out of lightweight plastic and smaller than I hoped. It would be nice if it came with a little backpack or something to carry all of these things in. I wouldn't purchase it again."
3,Not great,I had high hopes for this toy but it isn't as nice as I expected it to be. We played with a similar camping set at a library that was much nicer.
5,move aside play kitchen,I bought these to get my daughter excited for a camping trip & she loved it! It kept her occupied at the camp site & she now plays with it daily. She'd much rather cook on her one burner than her play stove! The lantern is really bright. My dad said her has better camping gear than he does lol!
2,Very unhappy boy,"This is a very cute camping set. My 5 year old was so excited to get this and go ‘camping’ in his playroom. Less than 24 hours after opening the box two of the toys are broken. The lantern stopped working for no reason after about 4 hours. We replaced the batteries just in case but that’s not the problem. It could be the bulb but seeing as how it died while sitting and not being touched, I doubt that is the problem. If the toy had been dropped or treated roughly I would understand but it was literally sitting in the corner of the tent and just quit. The ‘stove’ was also dead by the end of day one. It’s a very cute toy and my son had so much fun cooking us food on his ‘fire’. He was lifting the ‘flames’ up higher to make me some dinner and the knob broke of in his hand. This is a great set and was a lot of fun but the two main toys are broken already. Very poor quality in a toy designed for children."
1,Constant Amazon Shopper,"Very cute toys. My son likes playing with them, but the lantern does not work. It did not light up after several battery changes - not what I paid for."
3,small and cheap,Our 3 year old did have fun with this although it was very cheaply made. The lantern light bulb burned out within the first minute but you could not really tell it was on anyway. The knob on the stove was broke day one. The appearance is just very cheap looking.
4,Border Patrol,"I found this book to be very informative and entertaining. I my self am looking into applying for a Border Patrol job. Therefore, I'm trying to learn as much about the job as possible. This book gave several real life situations that one could expect as an INS agent. The book was writen by Alvin Edward Moore who served in 1926 thru 1928. As you could imagine the times were a bit different compared to now. However, he still says that the job itself hasn't changed. The reason I gave four stars instead of five is that the book seems like it might exagerate the facts a little. Over all I really liked the book."
5,Great Educational Fiction,"For whatever reason I really enjoy reading Gary Cowart's story. This book should have been far more successful. I felt the main charecter's (Chad) pain, frustration, hope, fear, his resignation of his situation. This book is a great entertaining way to learn the ways of the Haida peoples. There is no reason for me to ramble on about how great this book was for me. Just read it yourself. If you are interested in Washington State, British Columbia history you must read this story. Thank you Mr Cowart."
1,Didn't like it,Sad to say but I definitely didn't care much for this book at all when I did read it. I loved the beginning but not the ending. It was so sad and eeriely twisted. I fell in love with her half brother because he was the only one on her side. It left me sad and disappointed to not read the other books.
1,"Good writing, poor story.",Golden is a great writer so that is not where the one story in my review comes from. I would also just like to note that *spoiler* it is not the fact of incest that makes this book disturbing to me. There are several issues I have of what occurs in this book that made me unable to finish the last third of the book. I couldn't even bring myself to do it.
5,Great idea for horse lover,"These are Great! Put on walls, windows, lamps, etc.. & won't destroy finish. Love these. Would recommend for anyone to buy"
3,Don't attempt to wipe down or clean,"Bought these for my niece and she loved them, put them all up on her wall immediately. Problems arose later though when she started drawing saddles and bridles on the horses, we tried to wipe the marker she used off and the entire graphic started coming off. She's 7 and spoiled rotten so much crying ensued and I'm sure she'll sucker someone into ordering her a replacement set soon, won't be me though."
5,Horse Decals,I bought this to put on Mason Jars for table decorations for our Miniature Horse Club Banquet. I think they look good and can be repositioned which was a plus. I can reuse them after the banquet if I want to so I think they are worth the money. You get several horse decals and I think anyone would be happy with them.
4,Horse Decals,I expected the decals to be bigger. I am satisfied with the way they make my daughter's room look. I have had them up for a week and so far they have not started to peel off.
5,Well worth it for a reasonabl;y-experienced musician.,"I've been playing guitar for quite a while, but just picked up the mandolin. Dix Bruce's book assumes a certain amount of knowledge of music and stringed instruments, but is not so advanced that it leaves you wondering whether to turn the page or not. The accompanying CD takes you through each unit, first at a slow speed, then at 'normal' (not Bill Monroe 'normal') speed. Some tracks have chop chords in one channel and single-note work in the other, so you can choose which one you want to work on. The lessons proceed with reasonable steps, and are well-presented. It never gets too simple, nor too complex (assuming you've been practicing). After a week or so, once I had the G chop chord reasonably well in hand, I was capable of playing along with others on simple tunes. Buy it!"
1,What's the Logic Behind...,"I do not understand why Chess has an absolutely wonderful vinyl record and CHOP IT UP to make a CD? Why on earth would they fade out LONG DISTANCE CALL at the very climax at the end? It makes no sense, they could fit almost twice the content, so space isn't the answer.Is there a CD version that includes the entire, uncut ""LONG DISTANCE CALL"" as it was on the vinyl release?"
4,super blues,"Fabulous record, but they cut out the ending of the first song; LONG DISTANT CALL.That is the best song on this record and they cut it!"
2,BORING AND UNIMAGINATIVE!,"First of all, to call this 'dark ambient' is an incorrect assesment. This is not dark ambient by any stretch of the imagination! This is supposed to be an auditiory representation of hades. This is just not working in so many ways! It sounds very redundant throughout with no depth or real variance from track to track! It seems at times to go from light mediocre ambience to failing attempts at darker ambience.If you want true creativity and ambience, stick with Lustmord and Robert Rich."
4,Tremor,"At first I found this album very difficult to listen to. I had to spend a lot of time with this one in order to get into it, more time than usual. But I like to give everything a chance, and as with all music I listen to, after repeated listenings I began to get used to it. Before long I actually found myself wanting to hear it again occasionally, and I still do. Now I think it's pretty cool, and ""The Insane Brightness"" is definately my favorite section."
3,very interesting Book,a very interesting take&structure within this book.a Book that has alot of details on Spirituality.
5,A collection not to be missed,"Richard Christian Matheson is the unequivocal master of the short story. Dystopia shows us why. Sixty superb stories are collected in this volume accompanied by illustrations by the wonderfully gifted Harry O. Morris. Not all of the stories in this volume are of the horror variety, either. Matheson demonstrates his literary flexibility with this collection and it is stunning. This is a book that truly should not be missed."
5,It Should Be a Movie,"As I read this exciting story I kept thinking it should be a TV movie. It has it all -- action and suspense as police close in on a ring of drug dealers, a compelling romance as the heroine, Cass, an undercover cop, falls in love with the prime suspect. Cass and the oh, so sexy, hero Derek, each struggle to banish the demons from their past as they move ahead into present danger. The climax is a nail-biter! Can't wait for Jenna Mills' next book."
1,Terrible,"This book was distasteful. The heroine, for a woman who claims to be totally in love with the hero, she had no problem lusting after and eventually sleeping with her uncle! This book threw me off from Cassie Edward's books completely. Personally, I don't know how Ms. Edwards expected her readers to read about an incestuous heroine and like both her (the heroine) and the book at the same time. This book should have never been published, especially in the romance genre. If I could give it less than one star I would."
3,"Interesting, yet Confusing","At the beginning of Westmark, you follow the story of Theo and how he gets in trouble. Then he goes on small adventures with new people who have very interesting backrounds. Suddenly, you are following another plot and then you are back to Theo and his friends. At the end, it all merges together into one big storyline. Although it can get very confusing, Lloyd Alexander has written it well, and you get very involved with the story. I would suggest this book to anyone who wants a page-turner."
2,Westmark,"The main character Theo is in big trouble. The book starts out with Theo in his masters print(he is the printers devil)shop. One day they get a huge order and start working on it. Just as soon as they almost get done with the printing order, Two government guards come in and hit Theo right in the stomache. His master helped both of them exscape(by fighting the guards off). Once they get far away the master makes Theo go a seprate way and to run off, but theo finds the person who gave them the order, Los Bommas and his dwarf guard Musket. Theo pleads for his help and he finally helps him but they soon find out that the evil Chief Minister Cabbarus has killed Theo's master. He will be soon to find out that Cabbarus has an evil plan that involves theo and the Los Bommas."
3,A little Overpriced,"I bought this for my three year old daughter, who loves Caillou. The doll was nice and good quality, but small, about 5 inches tall, the book seemed to be more appropriate for a 2 year old or younger, it only got a passing glance from my daughter who usually loves books. Considering the rarity of Caillou products out there I guess it was worth it, I could probabaly give the book to my nephews in a year."
2,Not all that!,So the kick pad is very hard and does not sound natural at all. It does not at all feel like my kick. I wouldnt buy it again if I had the choice. Rock on!!!
2,Frame rate freeze.,"Graphics are OK and all PSP games are short so I'm not sure why so many here complain about that. With this game when an enemy comes into view and you begin to exchange fire the game actually freezes up and three seconds later when it begins to move again you're like, ""Oh I guess I killed the guy?"". This happens all the time. Very annoying and not something I've seen in any other game I've ever palyed (SOCOM / KILLZONE / SYPHON FILTER).Best Buy has this game for $14.99. That's the only reason I was generous with 2 stars."
4,"Finally, R6 for the PSP.","A great game so far. Would have gotten 5 stars, but I despise the sniper missions that they should have let die with Lockdown, esp. combined with the freelock. Freelock gets truly annoying on the sniper missions. Awesome graphics for a handheld."
2,Terrible!,"The only good thing about this game is the ok online play. The campain is terrible, short and boring. Spend your money on syphon filter, socom or gta. This game has terrible graphics as well.Overall a BIG waste [...]"
2,OUCH!!!!!,dude what the crap I purchased this game thinking it was going to have good graphics and it would be fun I was wrong on both. its fun for the first few levels but gets really old. i've havent tried multiplayer wich is why it sucks so bad. unless you have wi-fi don't get this game OUCH!!!!!
1,Complete waste of time,"If ever there was a book that wes ripe for parody it's The Da Vinci Code. Unfortunately this book, The Da Vinci Cod, is a very poorly written, very poorly ploted sad substitute. Don't waste your time nor money on it. It is I'm afraid a greatly disappointing failure.I get the feeling that this failure is due in degree to--this may sound odd in talking about a parody, but it is an impression I have--taking the book The Da Vinci Code too seriously. Great parodies are achieved by pointing out the absurdities of their subject matter. This book, the Da Vinci Cod, seems to miss that altogether"
3,"High hopes, not product","The title's fantastic! I was sure the book would be too. However, though it's farsical and certainly spoofs Da Vinci Code (which I loved), it's just not funny. Better try my book instead."
4,Grosse orgelwerke!,"This CD was good. Leonhardt plays the pieces well. I thought that the highlights of this CD were the Toccata in D minor, Liebster Herr Jesu, Valet will ich dir geben, and the Prelude in E minor (""Cathedral""). I personally prefer Peter Hurford and Christopher Herrick as organists, but Leonhardt does a great job. Though I LOVE Bach's organ music, I think the program was a tad dull. The liner notes are good. The notes are in both English and German. Information is provided about the stops and other organ functions used, plus information about the organ itself. This is a fair collection of some of Bach's more obscure organ works. Four stars."
3,don't wanna let you go,"This single doesn't have enough variety on it. Buy one of the other ""Don't Wanna Let You Go"" singles that amazon sells."
5,This Bass is not only good looking but sick as hell,I just got done playing this bass earlier today and the sound quality is amazing. At my local music shop they had a Ashbory and the silicone strings are ridiculous. The fret less guitar feels so good is light weight and is over all incredible. Over all this guitar gets a 5 out of 5 if you want a fun play and a good sounding bass this is your pick
2,Pro Series,This game is not what I expected. It is fun but has many cliches. I do not suggest buying this one new or without trying first. Ours will not load muliple players it freezes frequently.
3,So so.....,Purchased a GT Pro series with wheel for Wii. The wheel itself is very flimsy and small. The steering etc. is not all that good. All in all I would give it a 5 at best.
3,"Not as good as ""Old and New""","One of my favorite decor books is Ms.Sorrell's ""Old and New"" and based on that I ordered this book. While it does feature some truly cool spaces, there are too many photos of hardware or a section of fabric or flooring - some full page closeups - for example: stainless steel knobs on a stove, the top portion of a hinged-arm lamp, or section of wood floor with a glass block inset. While these things are aesthetically pleasing to the eye, they really just seem like filler. I like to see rooms that inspire and excite me that I will study over and over again."
4,Great way to experience Austria,"If you have an extended budget, like to drive, and want to explore the culture and history of Austria this may be a good choice for you.This travel book is different than the rest in that it presents several travel (rather driving) itineraries to experience differnt parts of the country. It is well priced, with lots of good tourist information on all the major towns covered on the selected beautiful routes and also loding information (not for the travelers on a shoe-string budget)."
2,Christian science,"A good book for a Christian Scientist or a certain type of Baptist. For the rest of us, we have a hard time swallowing the whole, ""You're poor because you're not faithful and giving enough"" line."
2,Why...A Guide to Life's Toughest Questions,"http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/ref=pe_6680_15427820_cm_cr_ec_add_1_h_c15427820?ie=UTF8&nodeID;=&asin;=155874522X&customerID;=AQDHKVK02GAJ0#I was so disappointed to find that this book is one I read when it came out in 1994 and now just has a new cover and title. So misleading! I loved the info in 1994, but certainly there is more new that this author has to offer. If not, she shouldn't be entitled to my--or anyone else's---money to read something we already bought and read more than 15 years ago. Boo to the author and publisher."
2,Unconvincing,"New Age religious beliefs (like multiple past lives and the idea that souls choose their parents before birth) form the foundation for this book. Yet the author makes little effort to explain these concepts or to provide evidence that could convince the reader. If you do not understand and believe in these ideas before reading this book you probably will not get much out of it. I know I did not. Putting aside the issue of prior beliefs, the author's arguments were not always well supported and sometimes appeared speculative."
4,Self Taught Artist - glad I got it!,"I purchased this book at the House of Blues in New Orleans on a whim a few years back, and have enjoyed it ever since. I keep it put away so it won't get tore up. If I meet someone I feel can appreciate the book I will let them look at it. The subject of self-taught American artist is very interesting and the book will give you an insight into the artist themselves as well as some of their creations.However, the vast majority of the artists in the book are from the Deep South, and most are African-American. Nothing wrong with that, just thought I would let you know. You won't find Granda Moses in this book, but Finster is there.Now I see it is out of print. Too bad."
4,An excellent edition to the library.,"We bought this to replace our old one because it's definitely one that gets used. The explanations it has about the scriptures definitely helps when trying to understand the complex imagry and stories. One thing I think it lacks is a more in depth analysis of some of the scriptures, especially the ones that quote Issiah (sp?). But with this being for the family, I suppose deeper analysis would be more appropriate in a different book."
2,The Book of Mormon for Latter-Day Saint Families,I was aware the item was used but surprised it was water damaged. For the price that was given to me for this damaged item it was fair however don't know that I would have purchased it if aware. Kept it because it was needed for study. My suggestion is that you list the condition of your used items.
4,Clever series and great cast,"I more or less bought this because I am a fan of Keeley Hawes, however, the real scene stealer is Aidan Gillen, who is great as the slightly dubious but very likable John Bloom. The casting is well done and the stories good entertainment(if somewhat far fetched, I hope). Overall, I was very pleased, though apparently not everyone felt that way, as it did not get a second series."
2,Mundane drama,"This drama which was screeened weekly in the UK by ITV was thankfully not commissioned for a second series. That's good as none of the cast seem to gel in this series, many of the scenarios in the series seem quite unlikely and the major plot running throughout the series is quite ludicrous.There's far better out there than this.Don't waste your time!"
1,"A ""Snore"" Majeure-Awful","After the ""wows"" reviews, I was really disappointed by this bit of gar-Bargh.Acting was less than the quality actors would normally supply. Direction was no better than OK, and the story; and by extension the premise is both sloppy and foolish to the point where I thought I was watching yet another American Special Police genre.Just awful. Not awesome.At least New Tricks is fun and the actors appear to be enjoying their work. This show is justpainful.This, after watching two eipsodes, it does not even go into the ""saver bin"".A solid one star for good camera work in London."
4,Good but not much to compare,"My family was recently transferred to North Dakota with the Air Force. Before we moved we wanted to learn more about it, since we had never been here. It was very difficult to find ANYTHING in print about North Dakota. I finally found an older copy of this book in a book store in Anchorage, AK, and then went on-line and ordered the new edition.While I think this book is pretty decent, I wish I could find a book with more pictures. While North Dakota is hardly considered a popular tourist destination, there IS some pretty scenery. I think this book would be better if they added some sections with pictures. Otherwise, the book is pretty good. I would recommend it to anyone considering travel in North Dakota (or South Dakota, it also has a section on that state), but then again I have not come across a single other book that focuses on North Dakota as much."
2,And this is a science book?!,"This book has a very good section on nonbiological science, but when it gets to the biology, it has, in my opinion, a very wrong premise. It assumes macroevolution is a biological fact, when it is, in fact, quite the opposite. This premise saturates the book, and in doing so, biological facts do not fit together nicely at all. Microevolution has been proven by science to be a true, and normal, scientific occurence, but macroevolution, as presented in this book, is a mixture of very good imaginations (as manifested by their colorful illustrations), outdated theories,and a few observations twisted to fit their outlook on science. But as to the section on the non-living aspects of science, I commend this book. This part is unslanted and it has helped me understand many matters of science. Its illustrations make it voluminously easier to understand."
3,Typos,"This book covers almost everything school children will learn in science class. My children refer to it often to look for those extra new details concerning their classes. However they have discovered some errors (and this is the revised ed.)which I will call typos especially in the Periodic Table, which did dampen their enthusiasm with the book and shook their trust a little."
5,THIS CD WILL WAKE YOU UP,"Especially after you see this band in person. Roach is in a class all her own and is so fantastic, she couldn't live up to her own name performance after performance; it would be humanly impossible. Every song in this CD will give you chills -- especially ""Steppin'"" ""Phone Call From Leavenworth,"" and ""Smokestack Lightning.""In interest of their next CD, ""Our Town,"" ""Tobacco Road,"" ""Snatch it Back and Hold It,"" should put them on the charts. If not, there is absolutely NO JUSTICE in the music industry!-- BJ"
4,Real Women Sing the Blues!,"Café R&B: Don't Wake Me (In the Morning) Whoa! Strong bass opens this wailer... Roach - the singer is just terrific... she looks young and sounds old. The searing, ripping guitar lays atop that walking bass line and stirs up a woman's fancy... Sensuous, sexy and hot! A delicate little piano trill brings it back down to the vocalist... this is a songstress.... Who ARE these people? This is the voice Janis was working on. I hear born-again gospel screaming, pleading, longing .... She (Roach!) is unbelievable....Steppin': The musicians here are tight ... two songs in a row of tremendous rock & roll... Tina talks through this woman... there is Bonnie Rate and Tracy Nelson (from Mother Earth, many years ago!). We concentrate on vocalists like this, but this no shabby backup group.. .they are a solid unit... what a rush! The piano insinuates itself like an itch you just can't scratch."
2,Not academic in any way,I think there are a lot of people that would like to believe in what in this book. On the surface it is an easy read since written in a good conversational language but the content does not sound credible. It does not provide good resources and does not make a good case.
5,Buy It!,"If you love history as I do, if you have some relatives that seem to get lost somewhere in Virginia, N.C. even S.C. If you've been told that great=great grandma or grandpa was an American Indian and you have even seen the picture, read this book. I am an African-American female, grand-daughter of a mulatto, great-great-grand=daughter of a Cherokee Indian, so I have been told. I can't trace my great=great grand father beyond Virginia - he was a blacksmith. The Melungeons (some) were known for their work with silver. Is Great great grandpa Cary from one of those mountain groups? I don't know but I am going to find out. This book has me thinking. Buy it, it will have you thinking too!!"
1,"Not proud people, but shameful people.","This book is a big YAWN. The so-called Melungeions are nothing more but a bunch of scared and ashamed people. For all intents and purposes they are ""white people"" but because they are worst kind of racists, they insist that they have ""AmeriIndian ancestry and deny their very distant African ancestry. Even though many of them carry the surname of their Angolan paternal ancestors, google Mozingo family. Proud is not a word I use to describe these people."
4,Melungeon's - The Book That Started It All,"A very interesting book and Kennedy raises some great questions and offers possible answers. The book is interesting along with his quest for a true medical diagnosis of his medical condition, that comes from his Mulungeon ancestry. I do fault the book in that Kennedy does make some big leaps in his assumptions without backing them up. But it is well worth the read and remember that this is the book that started the other books about the Mulungeons."
3,They're fine shoes...,"But they're not made in Spain anymore, at least not these sandals. I was disappointed to find that the box said ""Made in Spain"" but hidden inside the sandal they're stamped ""Made in China."" I went out of my way to buy shoes that were not made in China, and will be sending them back."
2,"No, not Anymore","James Cotton is a blazing bluesman with a hot harp, but his voice has deteriorated so badly that this disc is basically unlistenable, except the cuts where Darrell Nullisch does the vocals. Cotton still plays great, but he shouldn't try to sing anymore. Just listen to the song samples to hear it for yourself."
3,"Mean Harmonica, Ravaged Voice","Veteran blues harmonica man James Cotton is accompanied on this well-recorded Telarc recording by Rico McFarland on guitar and David Maxwell on piano. Cotton also sings on several tracks, and unfortunately, his voice is really weak; however, vocalist Darrell Nullisch also sings a couple of the songs, and he does a better job. So far, my description of this recording does not sound very promising, but what redeems this set is that the instrumental portions are really pretty good. Cotton plays a mean harmonica, and the guitar and piano are both attacked with plenty of upbeat energy, making for a pleasant listening experience if you can get around Cotton's vocal contributions."
1,Broken case,The watch came with the box in terrible shape. The lid has hinges broken off. QA did not bother when sending this out.Otherwise watch is still working.One star for this.
1,"""Fast and Furious"" It's fast and I'm furious","Thinking I needed a fast memory card for continuous shooting on my Canon A710 digital camera, I bought the Promax 512MB Sd 150X memory card. On day one I took about 30 pictures before I received a ""memory card error"". I lost all the pictures and could not retreive tham on my camera or computer. I then put in my normal speed Sd card and could still shoot on continuous mode without problems.Maybe fast isn't necessary, especially if it isn't reliable."
4,Gospel albm,The album that I bought was just what I expected. I had many reall good songs and arrived to me in thee most Excellent condition! THank you so much! I m so glad I made this purchase!
1,"Gets stuck in brick driveway, because of the metal wear strip","Its an ok shovel nothing special. It easily gets stuck in my brick driveway, because of the metal wear strip, whereas my cheap shovel without the metal wear strip glides through easily. Me and a friend of mine, after using it for a few times felt that it is in fact not that ergonomic, as both of us felt discomfort in lower back after using it, whereas the regular straight handle (without curved stick) felt much better."
5,No more snow!!!,"I know the season is pretty much over (in Ohio it can snow on any given day), but this is a must have for someone that does not want to spend big bucks on a snow blower. This multi use shovel is better then your average snow shovel. It allows a very ease of use for both male and females and also reduces the amount of work and stress on your back.Whether your just pushing snow off your deck or shoveling your driveway, the Suncast is a perfect choice for snow shovel."
3,A Little Expensive,"I like the shovel, although I have not used it, no snow at this time.I must say though my Son brought a shovel for me, not knowing I bought one , for about 1/2 the price I paid and very similar looking"
4,Medium Priced Snow Shovel,"I must tell you I bought this by mistake. I was just checking if shipping was free, and next thing I know I bought it. Well It came, no packaging, just a UPS sticker on the shovel part. The metal ""wear strip"" is a good feature, good for my concrete driveway. (The metal strip was curved a tiny bit which bothered me - I will try to straighten it out somehow.) With all the unnatural January snow in Mid Georgia, all the snow shovels around here were sold out. I borrowed a neighbor's, a big metal one, and it was pretty heavy. So I'm glad this one is part plastic. My sister up north says the ergonomic handle is well worth the extra cost and will save your back. My husband says we will use this snow shovel maybe twice in the next 20 years. I think he will use it twice in the next 20 years - I will use it more. Haha, funny joke. I'm now ready for any future snow/ice storms."
4,"Good shovel, but I modify it slightly to make it great!","I've had two of these shovels so far because I wear them out. To make them easier to use, I drill the rivets holding the metal blade on so that I can remove the blade all together. Plastic on concrete or brick is MUCH easier to push, and slide and it doesn't grab, which IMO causes more muscle strain than anything. Sure, they wear out faster, but I still get 5-6 good seasons out of them.If you have issues pushing it, do as I stated above. It makes a good shovel great!"
3,You will paint this way or else,"The authors describe their techniques for painting miniatures with oils. I found the ""do it this way or else"" tone somewhat condescending. The examples are not very useful as the most difficult step, bending, is not shown. He goes from unblended to blended without an intermediate steps.Davidson's book ""Painting Ancient and Medieval Warriors"" is a better introductory text."
4,A good and informative book,"This is a good book that should teach you a lot about the development and experiences of gay and bisexual young men, from childhood to young adulthood. The author interviewed a number gay and bisexual young men and throughout the text he includes exerpts from his interviews, which add more 'proof' and 'reality' to the text itself. The only bad thing might be that his sample was pretty limited - mostly college students at Cornell University. It's more of a textbook than anything else, but it still makes a very interesting read."
5,great,"This is probably the best book on gay issues I have ever read! I do not buy those kind of books very often, but this was definitely worth the money."
1,"became gay? a review of the title, not the book.","what's up with the title of this book? is the author first and foremost trying imply that people become homosexual rather than realize that they are homosexual? i spent to many years wishing i were not gay(those days are gladly over), so maybe that is why i found fault with this title. but if i hear some dumbass tell me that i chose, or became gay, as if by some thought-out, conscious decision, flames are gonna start shooting out of my big gay head."
5,The dark side,"Norman Mailer was a genius. He was also incredibly violent and mentally ill. This excellent documentary explores Mailer's dark side through interviews with his family members, biographers, ex-wives and critics. Excellent archival footage is used through out the film."
2,looks like the wrong item,the site says this should work on my 2010 porsche but when i compared it to the oem filter its so small and does not look right. for future buyers be cautious when buying this product. its not the right one.
1,"Don't ""Take A Chance"" on this disc",I'm glad I read the other reviews first. I almost bought it without a second thought. No Words!!!!! Stay away from this disc!!!!
3,"Informative, but vague","Very inspiring and uplifting, this book is a delightful read. However the discussions about horse-human relationships reflect a human interpretation as oppose to the investigation of a horse as a herd animal. All in all, enlightening, but leaving the curious horse enthusiast with some questions.Claire Dorotik, author, ON THE BACK OF A HORSE: Harnessing the healing power of the human-equine bond."
2,Complicated and uninspiring,"I am with the person from Monte Sereno, CA - I just couldn't get past the first few chapters - waiting for the book to ""get to the point."" I prefer a simple, straight forward anecdotal style. If you want to get right into a horse's head and heart, I strongly suggest reading anything (and everything) by Mark Rashid, Chris Irwin, or Henry Blake."
1,Very Diasappointed,"After reading several wonderful books about horse psychology, (The Body Language of Horses, Horses Never Lie, Almost a Horse Whisperer) this book ventured far into the unknown. I tried several times to choose the next chapter and give the authors another chance and there was something missing. This book was more about the authors and their patients than about horses. I have remove it from my reading list and would not recommend it at all."
4,Horse Sense,"This book presented a good overview of the usefulness of horses in therapy. Some of terms were very psychological, however, and perhaps not understood by the general public. It gave a good viewpoint of how horses can be used to help people struggling with their own problems. The specific examples were particularly helpful."
3,interesting life,found the book more interesting to read as a biography of barbara feldon's life than as a self help get over the break up type of manual...there really isn't anything in the book that your friends won't tell you anyway! still - i'm glad i'm reading it.
3,Agent 99 in a different light,"Probably my fault, but this book is small in size - smaller than many paperbacks. It is okay, but I had heard so much about it that I expected more. It is well-written and nice, but not as in-depth as I had hoped."
2,Kind of disappointing,I didn't find much of substance here. Basically it says if you don't have a live-in friend then you should have other friends. I had actually already figured that out . . .
2,Not sure if I liked this one so much,"It was difficult to get into reading this book, since I had just finished reading ""Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled, and Independent"" by Judy Ford (which I highly recommend over this book). In my opinion, ""Living Alone and Loving It"" reads more like the author's autobiography of singleness than it does as a guide to actually ""loving it"". It's not as matter-of-fact and loveable as ""Single"" was. Barbara Feldon tends to get over-wordy where it isn't necessary, as if she was trying to write the great American novel when she wrote this. It is nice to read her book and know that you're not alone in your singleness, but this book was almost down-right boring."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Unless you're a distant relative of Shakespeare or Einstein, this book probably isn't for you. The author uses too many descriptive words and also uses words that no ""ordinary"" person would ever use. This book is geared more toward the wealthy socialites than for those of us in the ""real world""."
5,Not Agent 99! (LOL),"This book was such a ride! Since I grew up watching Agent 99 on Get Smart, as a kid, reading her book felt very intimate. I just kept thinking, ""NOT AGENT 99!,"" as I read about the ups and downs in her personal and love life. Yet, it isn't a celebrity expose. Her words are meant to inspire and go beyond the shallow genre of gossip. You really do forget that this woman was a television icon because she is very down to earth and generous in spirit. As many other readers here have shared, I could not put this book down. I found it inspiring and helpful. Excellent!!!"
3,Short Essays,"This book is a collection of short essays by audiocolumnist Tom Bodett. The essays range from tools and how to use them, to fathering and environmentalism. Some are humorous, others intended in a more serious vein. The essays were originally written in the late 1980s, so a few of them are dated by now, but others are timeless."
4,A comfort book.,"Tom Bodett is always funny. This is not quite as funny asothers he has written, but he is always good. Havinglived in Alaska myself, I can enjoy this more thanperhaps others might. It's a ""you-have-to-have been-there"" thing. This is a ""comfort"" book - the kind you pickup for slower reading, maybe just a chapter or two at atime - but you always feel better after the read."
2,No comfort in small comforts,"After being introduced to Tom Bodett's work through the Norman Tuttle book, I looked forward to another set of his stories. I think I picked the wrong volume. Small Comforts was a big disappointment. I understand that it was a series of essays, but I still looked for, and found no consistency from one to the other. With few exceptions, these essays were not interesting nor enlightening. If you've never read Tom Bodett, I suggest you start with a different book. I'll give him another shot, but he's on thin ice with this one."
4,Snowboard Showdown,"I enjoyed this book because I learned a good lesson from it. How you shouldn't break a promise, the one Freddie made to his dad. He got what he wanted in the end by doing the right thing. I would recommend this book a friend."
4,"Delightful, sophisticated humor","One can't simply read ABOUT Liz Bevarly's characters; one lives THROUGH them, in large part due to the author's wonderful, unhurried meanderings through their heads. HOW TO TRAP A TYCOON is no exception. On the surface, the story line may seem a bit far-fetched, but is nonetheless a perfect vehicle for Ms. Bevarly's strong, unique voice. And, if you scratch just below the surface, you'll find a nice little theme going there about identity and how the face we show to the world isn't always who we really are.Which is one reason I, for one, absolutely adored the secondary romance, finding its more serious tone a nice counterbalance to the main storyline. In fact, I'm not sure I didn't love the more layered Lucas and Edie -- both of whom were not at all who they appeared to be on the surface -- even more than Adam and Dorsey.And let me tell ya -- there are a couple lines in there that I'm sure are destined for the Most Often Quoted Hall of Fame.Fun book."
2,Silly,"I read romance, so I must necessarily and regularly suspend my disbelief of romance heroines' (and heroes') actions. But the actions of Dorsey, the heroine in How to Trap a Tycoon, made me want to throw this book against the wall. Dorsey is supposed to be a serious academic, committed to her college and her career. Yet, Dorsey allows her editor to guilt her into playing ""dress up"" and go on a book tour which could ruin her reputation. When she gives in, I lost all respect for her.And the hero! He's dumb enough to sleep with Dorsey and then not recognize her because she wears a tight dress and a lot of makeup.Bevarly almost made up for her characterization with some funny lines -- the only reason this book didn't hit my wall. However, this book doesn't match My Man Pendleton in wit. (If you want to read a good Bevarly book, I suggest finding My Man Pendleton.)On a side note, as I have spent a lot of time in the Michigan Avenue Borders, I was happy to see it appear in print."
2,An Ok Read.....,"I have read all of Bevarly's books and have come to find that the heros are cast in pretty much of the same mold (within the non series books). The heros are divorced, cynical and wary of the female species. So if you have read her last 2 books in the non series grouping, then you don't need to bother with this one."
4,"Cute, Fun Screwball Comedy Set In Present Day","I've read this author's prior two novels, which are also screwball comedies like those seen in the 1930s. This third book is her most succssful in terms of updating the screwball comedy to 2000. In the other two I still felt a bit caught in a time warp. She also sets this novel in Chicago which works nicely. Basically, a woman finishing up her PhD in sociology writes a bestselling tongue-in-cheek guide for trapping a rich guy and, of course, ""traps"" the very guy without even trying while she works undercover at a rich man's Men's Only Private Club/Bar. She's using this job to get data for her dissertation on power between men and women. It's a fun story, an enjoyable entertainment and of absolutely no ""higher"" value whatsoever. This is also her 3rd cartoon cover and it is probably her cutest. A cartoon cover actually suits her novels quite well whereas some novels which use them are not as lighthearted as the cartoon cover would imply to the reader."
3,Reads like a comedy act,"The only lasting impression I have of this book is that it read like a script for a sit-com or a stand-up comedy act. It is over-flowing with one-liners, tongue-in-cheek observation, and quirky dialog like ""Whoa, baby"" and ""One hot tomata"". I kept expecting to hear a laugh track going off, or a drum roll after the punch line.Humor and comedy can add sparkle and life to a story; but like everything else, when used in excess it just gets monotonous."
5,How to Trap a Tycoon,"Who wants to marry a millionaire? Seems like all the female population of the USA does, except for doctoral candidate Dorsey McGuinness. As ""Lauren Grable-Monroe,"" Dorsey wrote the sexy how-to book--How to Trap a Tycoon. She did it for extra money to finance her education. Now that her publisher wanted her to take a book tour. The wild disguises and elusive moves just made ""Lauren"" even more mysterious. Adam Darien was skeptical. He didn't believe a word of the manual. He thought Dorsey was just a Ph.D. candidate working part time as a bartender. When he found out the truth, sparks began to fly! This book's plot is contrived, but the lovable characters can easily suspend any disbelief. It's laugh-out-loud, wonderfully funny, and that's my final answer!"
4,Smaller than I expected,"Yes, it does say it's 8"" X 12"", but I guess I had a hard time visualizing how big, or rather how small, that actually is. Despite that, it's a really nice cutting board; a good size for vege's. Also being bamboo, it tolerates water better than regular wood, and cleans up easily in the sink."
4,"Nice, Simple Cutting Board","I received this cutting board along with a knife I had purchased and find it to be fairly useful. This isn't my primary cutting board and I wouldn't intend on using it as such, but it does come in handy. It's a good size for small cutting tasks. The bamboo makes it a somewhat attractive board, but also means added upkeep. An occasional light sanding and oiling will keep the board from fading under the wear of knife scratches and cuts. The grooves cut out on the sides of the board provide great handles. Price is fair for a bamboo cutting board. If you are looking for a deal, consider purchasing as a bonus with other Wusthof products.Pros:> Convenient size.> Grooves on the ends provide good handles.> Rubber feet provide stability and slip resistance.> Attractive.> Fair price considering that it's bamboo and carries the Wusthof name.Cons:> Must be hand washed.> Fades unless oiled. Light sanding helps remove scratches."
1,Board Cracked in Half after 4 months of use,"I'm not sure how this board got this many positive reviews. I must've gotten a lemon. I know it's bamboo and constructed of four separate bamboo pieces but I thought this cutting board would last longer. I have uploaded a picture of the split board. I used it on a regular basis to do light cutting for vegetables. I'm a bachelor and I don't cook much, but I guess I was too much for this cutting board. I really wish I could get a refund."
1,Mine broke in half after 3 months,"I received this cutting board for Christmas as a bonus gift with my new santoku knife. It is a very attractive cutting board and is a great size for me, as I usually cook for two and don't need a huge board. I always take good care of my equipment, but my wife put it in the dishwasher one time and it broke in half. I have had many boards and have never had one split in two after a wash cycle. I am currently trying to get it replaced under warranty, but I have to pay insured shipping on a $10 cutting board, which may not be worth it.UPDATEThis is being replaced and shipped to me for no charge. I would like to commend the customer service of Wustof. I will definitely purchase their products in the future."
2,Cracked,Cracked along the bamboo slats. Worked good until then. Probably has a finite number of dishwasher cycles before they give out. I had other boards that survived but I liked the size and feet on the Wusthof
1,SMALL,"This cutting board was much smaller than i had anticipated. I don't remember the amazon site giving the dimensions. So i didn't look and i was disappointed. But it's there for every cutting need, just in a smaller area."
1,They got me,"Although this a nice little cutting board and it comes in handy, it was not worth the 9.99 I paid for it especially since it said bonus board on the back...meaning it should have come as a free gift along with the purchase of a knife. I should have sent it back....shoulda coulda woulda"
5,"Excellent Quality, Perfect Size","Board is very light, easy to wash, easy to maintain. Because of the bamboo make no scratches visible. Pure Wusthof quality. Need I even mention the exceptionally low price ?"
1,Good for one year only,"I love Wusthof knives and although this cutting board was the absolute perfect small size, it just did not hold up to simply warm/hot water hand washing and eventually split down the middle. It's really a great size, it's a shame."
4,Natural beauty and Native American wisdom,"Starring Michael Horse and Steve Martin's Working Wild Life, music by Coyote Oldman and R. Carlos Nakai. A mystical grandfather transforms the life of a modern day boy through a legend, tracking a mountain lion and gaining its trust."
3,Weak parts...,"We ordered this cooking play set for our play kitchen. Within about 2 weeks, most of the handles had fallen off the pots just during regular play. The kids weren't destructive with the utensils but they also broke. Don't waste your money on this product. Go with something plastic."
3,Beautiful artwork...,"I could tell Akiyama-san was in CLAMP just by looking at the cover. I bought the first volume, and rushed home to read it.I became quite confused at what was happening, so much that I had to put the book down and start over again.Akiyama-san should have set this tale up differently, and with more character differences. The mechs all look alike, so during the fight scenes ( which practically *were* the book ) I couldn't tell which side was which!If you have much greater patience than I, I reccomend this book, if only for the artwork."
3,Fantastic,"Well, in hyper rune,Rune is the space queen which is the savior of the universe it is similar to the main character of Sailor Moon in Usagi being the Neo Queen Serenity/Sailor Moon/Sailor Cosmos.But I find Emperor Gald creepy but also handsome I recommend Hyper Rune because it is so interesting that i want to buy more volumes."
4,Great shipping service,"This is the cutest little book that very simply and entertainingly depicts that when ""the right thing comes along"" you still can't believe it!"
1,Homeschool Mom,"I bought this for my 14 year old son and was very disappointed. The toy is limiting, due to the size and shape of the templates and the plastic walls. The support pieces for the walls are ""chunky"" and get in the way of the overall design. A pad of graph paper, plastic templates that are available at office supply stores, a good metal ruler, some paper and tape are a better investment than this."
2,Pricey for poor quality,"This item looked like a neat way to make multiple designs and then take them apart and reuse the materials. However, I was very disappointed by the limited number of sheets of drawing paper and even more disappointed to see the ""templates."" These are thin plastic that do not even lay flat. They are not standard template weight plastic but little more than plastic film. My 12 year son is working with it, but it certainly was not worth the $50 we paid let alone the $85 that it is now selling for."
5,Great idea,"I am 16 now and remember using this when I was around 10. I loved it. I would build a lot of houses. Some people are complaining about the number of supplies that come with it, but I just went out and bought more large tracing paper. I think this was a lot of fun and would recommend it to anyone whose kids have an interest in architecture."
4,Young architect,It's pretty pricey for what you get but my stepdaughter really likes it so I guess it was worth it. Basically the product could easily be replicated at home with a little effort.
1,missing over half the pieces...product returned=(,young architect looked very creative & fun. 11 yr old daughter opened on Christmas day to find more than half the pieces were missing. very disappointed. product returned.
1,Unhappy,Very dissapointed. I ordered this for my daughter last year and it had pieces missing from the box. We tried it again this Christmas because she really wanted it and is interested in design. The plastic base is covered in a tear off protective paper that you can not tear off. Obviously someone else had the same problem with this because you can tell a person has already tried to peel the paper off and couldn't. Can't believe it was send out again in this condition.
4,Young Architect for a young architect,"Very nice set for my 11-year old, who wants to be an architect. Only downside was the large plexiglas piece had lot of packing sticky stuff attached and we needed to rub the piece down with rubbing alcohol to clean it. Other than that, set is very detailed and a very nice version of what an architect might encounter. I highly recommend it. Was very hard to find around XMAS; Amazon was the only one that had it...THANK YOU AMAZON!"
1,Author reveals his bias by examples selected,"How did Islam spread to Indonesia? No Muslim armies landed there - a nation of over 3000 inhabited islands.As scholars of history know, it is Christianity that was spread by the sword.The Crusades were undertaken for the purpose of plunder, and coversion. Jihad in Islam is undertaken to improve oneself, and to eliminate oppression."
2,"This book is bias opinion, not history recounted","I am not Muslim and have a Christian background, but from the beginning pages, this author shows a strong bias against Islam which makes it hard to read. He does this by presenting historical facts, then characterizing the event with his own comments, which are often critical and condescending to Muhammad and Islam. Want just one of dozens of examples? After detailing the jihad in Spain by ""Almanzor the Victorious"", Almanzor died. Mr. Fregosi then comments, that he probably isn't in hell,""A rejuvenated Almanzor may...be frolicking in the Muslim paradise with his houris (sic. concubines), though unbridled copulation hardly seems Almanzor's style."" This is not a history book but a book of commentary and opinion. Too bad. A scholarly book on the subject would be welcomed but this isn't it."
4,Religion a dead phenomena,"It looks like that people like Tom Vomit, see comments below, argue that Christianity and Judaism are somewhat of a more ""religion"" than Islam is. All religions have had much blood on their hands and they all are guilty of crimes against humanity. In fact I suggest that we put the founders of all these religions on trial for crimes against humanity. To think that somehow one religion is more peaceful than the others is so stupid to say the least."
1,Avoid This Book if You Value Money!,"This is a dreadful book by any standard. It is full of wrong facts as well as dates, and it is endlessly repetitive: Mr. Fregosi probably only wrote ten pages of so-called history and then just re-worded these to fill out the book. And his thesis of jihad is so simplistic and medieval in its good guy-bad guy depictions as to make it an embarrassment for me to read. In fact, I returned this to the store (which I almost never do, regardless of how I liked a book), just because it was so repugnant to me. I feared its inferiority would somehow infect my other, legitimate history books. This book really deserves to be called fiction. Come to think of it, just stay away from it and call it nonexistent. (It deserves negative stars! )"
4,Antidote to PC filters,"Fregosi's book is basically a synopsis of the conflicts between European and Islamic civilizations, from it's beginning to the present. As such, he specifically refutes politically correct assertions that Islamic violence is somehow a reaction to violence and aggression foisted on an innocent Islamic world by Europeans and Americans. The invasions and wars of aggression waged by the Islamic world against ""the West"" pre-date the Christian Crusades. Those Crusades, which defenders of terrorism constantly refer to, were blips in history compared to the brutal five hundred year muslim occupations of Iberia and Eastern Europe. This book has it's problems, notably a casual tone which is sometimes annoying. For the layperson who is curious about Islam's historical relationship to Europe, and who does not have time to check-out multiple volumes of reference material from the library, this book represents a good start to getting your questions answered."
1,Worst Book Ever,"This book is old, and you probably won't ever look for it...but I had to write a review. This book is nothing more than a list of episodes of TOS, TNG, and the movies up to ST:V. There is NOTHING of interest in the book, and what quotes and non-episode info there is has been taken off TV interviews or TV Guide.Worst of all, the authors comments about ST:TMP are almost laughable if you watch the documentary in the directors cut.So, if you happen upon this, avoid it like a Rigelian Blood Bat!"
3,Rebuttal of Electronic Enthusiast...,"I'd like to say that Maxtor makes very GOOD drives and has one of the best reputations when it comes to storage hardware. This particular drive here is okay, but in the long run will be too slow with its 5400 rpm speed. Make no mistake, Maxtor is a good company (read PC World reviews, etc. for proof); it's just that this particular drive isn't great: go for the UDMA 66 7200 rpm drives."
1,Agreed...Maxtor no thanks!,Price is not worth your data and time. Spend a little bit more and you will get something MUCH better.
3,Spacing in the Rear is Tight,"This case is absolutely exceptional in every way, except for one major problem... the mixer will not sit flush if you need to use XLR or 1/4"" plugs, for there is simply not enough room between the rear of the mixer and the rear of the case. Had they made the case one inch wider, this would be a flawless product. As it stands now, I had to cut, with a utility knife, a few areas of the case's rear foam just so I could create enough room to facilitate my XLR plugs. How could they not think of this ahead of time? I am satisfied overall, simply because every other ambit of this product is flawless, but I wonder with amazement how RR didn't approach this problem."
2,Not great.,I was not aware that it was really horror stories mixed liberally with gay erotica. I don't like erotica in my horror.
4,it's the COVER...,"I bought this because I'd read Drawing Blood, Lost Souls, Exquisite Corpse and Wormwood and I loved all of them. I like this one, too, although not as much as the others. Among my favorite stories in this book are Monday's Special and America. The way she always strays back to her previous characters (like in America) at least every once in a while appeals to me. After reading some of the other reviews, I have just one question to ask. Why is the cover of the book so important to everyone? It's the COVER..."
1,"Don't judge a book by it's cover ,indeed!","This book has long since been thrown in the trash!Wormwood is a terrific book of short stories. The opposite of that book is Are You Loathsome Tonight. There are only 2 stories that are good, the rest are terribly uninteresting or just not enjoyable. It is like Brite is trying too hard to write about shocking things, just to be a rebel. This book was a present and I'm so glad that I didn't pay for it myself. Her first three books are great, mind you. It's just that this book is sooooo horrible. Brite should give the money back to everyone who has ever bought this book, and apologize for it's awfulness! She starts the book with a letter from someone who doesn't like her which is sort of clever. Too bad what follows is garbage- which is where mine is!"
1,"wow, amazingly poor writing....","i read several of poppy's books before this, and i enjoyed _drawing blood_ very much. this book, however, is awful. the writing is often very immature and the cover art is so poor that it is laughable. don't waste money buying a book that isn't worth the paper upon which it was printed."
4,Good buy.,"This is a good product. Works well, but I just wish it had more than one port to plug in an outlet especially if you have a couple of things when travelling."
5,Great NPR story turned me on to this...,"I'm not a big classical music fan, but I heard the story about this CD on NPR and found my favorite new CD. The sound of the lute-harpsichord is so unique and sweet. To think that this instrument almost disappeared! Thank goodness for these folks bringing it back to life."
3,Interesting look at hippies on a commune,"We are interested in the subject so we enjoyed watching it. The whole cult mentality and how everybody can give their money to a guy to buy himself a Rolls Royce fascinates me. Of all the hippie commune/cults to be in, this one, honestly, didn't seem to be as much fun. They didn't party, except for the leader. ha,ha. But this is an interesting and unique, honest look at this one particular commune. The people whom I bought it from on Amazon sent a nice note and it is was a quality product."
3,It was good..,"It was good. It started out holding my attention but about 30% through, I just wanted to be done so I could move on to another book. I liked the characters, all of them, but it was rushed and felt like it was a 100 page book instead of 200 pages. I do not know, something was off with this story for me. It was a good afternoon read and I would recommend it, it just was not for me I guess!!"
4,Loved it.,"Good escapist fiction is like chips and salsa--fun! I admit I am a sucker for books featuring men and babies in positive relationships. This is one of those books you read, set aside, and reread later just for the fun of it."
4,"very useful right-angle drill, but...","I bought this drill to use to install metal straps to hold down the floor joists of my house to the plates, most in tight crawl spaces under the house.(hammering nails was not an option due to tight conditions)Using this drill, I was able to fasten most every location with screws. It had plenty power, to the point that I had to watch the torque: it wanted to twist my wrist. The only problem was, if it had a reverse switch I couldn't find it on the unit. Being able to reverse screws would have been a good feature. That was the only drawback to it."
4,Best Sports Law Book on the Market. Period.,"This book is a delight!Have you ever wondered how Brown v. Cohen has sculpted today's collegiate athletic landscape?The answers are locked inside this gem.Although not exactly a page turner, it is the industry standard in the cutting edge field of sports law."
5,Brilliant,Less than a week ago I went to a Veruca Salt concert. These guys were the opening band and their performance rocked. So I picked up a cd not knowing what to fully expect. Even though it was about 2 'o clock when I got home I put in the cd and fell in love I haven't listened to much else than this cd. . . I suggest you pick up one and fall in love with the music and the guys (They are too sweet!) Or just the music. But you can find different beats in this cd which is good when you're in a good or bad mood...JUST BUY IT!
1,Useless Product -- would give it 0 stars but 1 is the lowest,"The description of this product is very enticing. But when you open the box the disappointment starts and spirals out of control. This is a very poorly made kit in all respects. The materials used, the quality of the pieces, the manner in which they fit together are all a huge disappointment. Do not waste your money. Save yourself seeing your child's crestfallen face. I wish I had taken the time to return it."
1,Real Junk,"The Only good thing about this, is the book that comes along with the instructions. The suspension bridge, is made out of paper, the cement for the stone bridge does hold together properly.What a waste of money."
4,Follow-up Purchase,"I stumbled across a little rock bar called Curtain Club in Dallas on a mad trip from England straight to Deep Ellum with my girl and these guys were on stage with 12 naked woman doing there thing. What a good night, and a decent CD to buy later"
4,Been with tha' PIMPS for years!,"I have been listening to the pimps' do their thing for about the last three or four years, and there CD's are great. If you really want to hear them you need to head down to Deep Ellum and see them live. I live in Germany now so I have been spreadin' them out over here."
1,FUNNY IN A 13-YEAR-OLD KINDA WAY,"This album is funny, but not nearly as funny as watching the morons who take this stuff seriously. Really guys, Blue Mound is NOT the ghetto, and Donnie Franks is NOT a pimp. But these things aren't really what makes this album so bad. Plainly stated--the music is horrible at best. With the exception of a couple of almost-decent (although insanely unoriginal) country-tinged songs, there is nothing here. Has nobody out there even heard of G.G. Allin? Because if anyone has, then they'd realize what a balatant [remake] ""Easy Jesus"" and the rest of Pimpadelic are."
3,Hilarious lyrics,"This band cracks me up. But they aren't half as funny as the fans out there who actually take this kind of music seriously. That, my friends, is hilarious. These guys are just jackin' around in the studio and having fun. They aren't very original and the replay-value isn't that high, but on the plus side, the lyrics are really funny and the biggest kick of this cd comes from playing it for your friends."
1,"a band full of coke snorting pedophiles, YAY!","it seems all they talk about is banging minor girls, doing coke, and the lead singer keeps bragging about how he's David Allan Coe's nephew. Oh and what's even funnier is they hate Kid Rock and what's sad about that is they sound EXACTLY like him. Living in texas, where they reside at, I know all about these guys and of course this is my opinion, they're just a ""never was"" to me. Do yourself a favor, and boycott these idiots."
3,"Great, as far as it goes.","This video does a very good job of examining the differences between men and women in relationship formation and addresses common pitfalls for both. In tape one, John discusses and summarizes what he calls the five stages of dating and states that in subsequent classes/tapes/seminars, he will expand on each of these stages. In tape two, he expands on stage one, ""attraction"", but doesn't cover the other four stages as stated. I had to look to be sure I wasn't missing tapes. I want to have the other stages covered too! How did this oversight or omission happen? It's good but doesn't seem complete."
4,Good Stuff,The Mars Venus on a date video set was originally a seven tape set. It was discontinued and the first two tapes from that set became this set. That is why this two tape set seems incomplete. The other five tapes have been taken out. Having said that the information on this set is excellent. John Gray has an understanding of relationships that no one else has and his insights and observations are truly clever. This set is well worth getting. Just be sure to read the book first.
5,Yummy,I used to buy this at a certain grocer but can no longer find. It's the best My family is happy.
2,Not worth it,"This makes for a decent side dish, but no where near as good as the actual corn cake from El Torito. I would not buy it again just because it doesn't compare to the real thing."
2,"Great concept, poor execution","This knife set has many excellent features but they are almost impossible to access. The knives and so forth are too hard to pull out of the case--I have to use my tiny Swiss Army knife as a lever to pull out the knives, which pretty much defeats the purpose of carrying this one. Too bad!"
4,girly migiver tool,"well, i am afraid to accidently pop the lid off so i don't use it alot, but its nice for those no brainer things like tweezers, pin, saftey pin, and the little compartment is good for keeping spare barbell peices for my earrings and sush. i am forever loosing the ball off of my labret piercing so i keep a spare in there."
1,"no directions or charger comes with this item. after contacting my inquirey, it does not come with directions or charger.",this item does not come with directions or the ability to charge item. i have neuropathy and was hopeing i would use this to increase circulation. very disappointed. i inquired about the missing instructions and charger. their response was the item doesn't come with product. waste of time and money.
5,A Sense of Urgency,I'm a relatively new Buddy Miller fan and have only heard just a couple of his prior works. There is a sense of urgency here that I haven't heard from Buddy before. Hands down the best Americana album of the year.
4,Some great songs,"Buddy Miller's CD features his rough vocals and top-quality, heavy-duty guitar work plus a pair of screeching, ecstatic background singers, the McCrary sisters. On songs such as ""Worry too Much,"" the results are spectacularly good. ""Shelter Me"" is another song I like a lot.This is hard rocking, anti-war, socially-conscious, southern gospel type music. The touch is heavy handed on Bob Dylan's song, ""With God on our Side."" The tune is excellent but the words are simplistic, and Buddy drags the song out for 9 minutes. It pains my ears to listen to the words at the same time that I enjoy Buddy's marvelous guitar playing.The concept of this CD is apparently to show that fundamentalist Christianity has a heart -- and a lot of soul. That effort succeeds and most of the songs on this CD are good or really good.Smallchief"
2,Buddy Miller sings gospel,I love Buddy Miller but am not a gospel music fan. The first song on the cd is good and not gospel. The rest of the cd is gospel which I dont enjoy.
5,Highly recommended,"It seems so obvious, but Anita Robboy's book, Aftermarriage, makes it clear that a legal divorce really doesn't end the marriage relationship. The concept of ""aftermarriage"" more accurately describes the long post-divorce relationship as the couple deals with issues around money, children and, later, grandchildren. This book is a must-read for those entering marriage, as well as those contemplating or going through a divorce. Mental health professionals and divorce attorneys, like myself, should recommend it to their clients so they can view divorce as just a first phase of a long, ""aftermarriage"" relationship."
5,AFTERMARRIAGE: THE MYTH OF DIVORCE,"For anyone who is married, contemplating marriage, contemplating divorce, or in the midst of a divorce, this book is an absolute must read. The author sets forth her thesis at the outset-that marriage is really forever (excepting only for short term childless marriages.) She provides a wonderful roadmap to the divorce process and a fresh approach to marriage and what follows: aftermarriage. It has changed permanently my thinking about marriage and aftermarriage."
3,Slight dissapointment :(,"I just got my copy the other day and I have not really got on to it yet it look's like it would be a darn good book, How ever there is one major hang up and that hang up is that over half the book is in latin so if you are like me and have poor or no latin skill's Your going to be in for dissapointment I think the least they could have done was translate it for people who cant read latin Surly the publisher's had to know that."
2,Manual Reprint,"This book is definitly not worthy of the $40 I payed for it. It doesn't give any techniques or tips for doing anything, all it does it explain how to ""technically"" do things in Carrara. Even the picture gallery in the book is horrible. I could make the images in it in 10 minutes. Just about everything in this book could also be read in the manual. I sent my copy back. I give it two stars because someone who can't understand the simple text in the manual may get something out of this book. For the rest of us intermediate-advanced users, this one is worthless"
5,A powerful software has now a powerful book,"This book covers all the different aspects of Carrara 1.0 and its CD-ROM is packed with the best you can find. You may find that there is too much detail in the book, but soon you will discover why this will help you to become a master of your own talent."
1,Carrara 1 Bible,"The CD included has no provision for its use by the Macintosh platform. Although this is stated on the rear cover of the book, there is no indication of this fact in your on-line advertisement."
2,Does NOT include all necessary materials!,"I am very disappointed in receiving this kit! Really all you get are the instructions for the experiments (easily enough found in a book or on the Internet) and a few supplies. For example for the volcano, included is 2 sheets construction paper, pumice, magnifying glass, black paint and paint brush. You need to supply newspaper, top of a shoebox, 2 1/2 liter plastic bottles, flour, water, vinegar, red food coloring, baking soda, liquid dish detergent and tape! I don't think this kit helps much in making the volcano!!! Doesn't seem worth $30 to me..."
3,"NOT a complete ""ready to go"" set","A great product, a fantastic learning experience. The only dissapointment I had was that I sat down with my son, who was VERY excited to get started and upon reading directions there are several ""common household items"" needed. None of which I had. The box states on the front 3 complete kits. As I looked at the box, there is indeed in small writing on the back ""will need some household items"". I just wish I had known ahead of time so I could have been more prepared for my son.However, I am very much looking forward to doing these experiements once I can manage to obtain these ""common household items"" which are not common in my household."
4,Great Book,I took an intro philosophy class at Texas A&M University and this was the book that I was required to buy. I thought this book was great. I really like that it had the problems online (if not all of them a majority of them). It was nice to be able to work out the problems from the book and then go online and type them in to see what you were doing right or what was wrong with you answer. It gave clear examples and was easy to understand.
5,An Excellent Introductory Text,"A while back, I had used this text for a course in Logic. The best thing about it was that the material was explained and illustrated so well that one can learn from this book without going to the classroom!This doesn't mean that someone should just read and move on; the problems given in this text are still critical to understanding and applying Logic. There's even an answer key for some of the problems, so one can check their own work!In addition, the skills that one can develop using this text are also transferrable - especially for those that are learning Programming.All in all, I'd recommend this text for anybody who needs an understanding of Logic, whether it be for a class or a profession. If one has an interest in more advanced concepts of Logic (e.g. - Counterfactuals), however, this book is not for you."
5,Power of Logic,"Service was very good, delivery time was short and the book was in very good condition"
1,"If you have to take a class in this, kill yourself.","Let me start by saying I received an A in the class. I wasn't too dim to understand the material, so this isn't whining from a bruised ego. Logic sounds cool. It isn't! I don't know if it's possible to make logic logical or not, but this book is a collection of poorly explained utter nonsense. Logic seems to combine the worst aspects of algebra and philosophy into one poorly organized discipline. This book doesn't help. It introduces ill conceived and vague concepts in a manner that seems to revel in their obscurity. It's like reading a review of the unix programming language from the guy that created unix. There are probably 8 people on Earth that would dig it, the rest... not so much."
4,Get out your hankies!,"Caitlin Bodine had returned to her hometown for a last reunion with her dying father, only to be hurt again. She could inherit half her father's ranch IF a blood test proved his paternity. Reno Duvall, her stepbrother and owner of the other half of the ranch, still hated Caitlin for causing his brother's death. He also hated himself for feeling attracted to Caitlin.An intense, heartwrenching tale of an emotionally abused and neglected woman's fight to accept love despite her feelings of low self-worth. Reno's cruelty is personal and explained, balancing on a thin line between abuse and understandable resentment."
4,Not A Cindrella Story,"Gehrman's first novel was a surprise from this publisher. If the reader expects to read a Cinderella story, she will be surprised to find an edge to the story and the characters. Anna, a gritty, modern young woman, takes charge of finding herself, and along the way meets other characters who are much deeper than those found in other typical chick books! Lucy, Anna's friend, is down right mean sometimes, smoking too much and leaving her lover to visit other men. Lucy and Anna visit Lucy's mother and step-father in Sequim, and the reader is introduced to a seamy, unkind way of life. There are dark suspicions of things unspoken. In the end Anna finds her way to her father, her mother and her own sense of self. Some of her meanderings remind me of Annie LaMott's book Traveling Mercies. Gehrman has talent; she shows her education with detailed and beautiful language. I can't wait to read her next book."
