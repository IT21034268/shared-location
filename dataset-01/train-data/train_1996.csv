4,HARMONY REMOTE,"This product is perfect for what I needed, It works through walls and helps me hide all wires and boxes connected to the tv. I am having problems with it freezing up. I contacted customer service and they were kind of confused on how to resolve the problem. If it stops freezing up the item is great and I would highly recommend purchasing. I am looking into a warranty since I am already having problems just in case down the road."
3,Less than totally pleased,"Have had this remote for about 3 months now. Initial setup was relatively simple and results were quite satisfactory early on. Found the ""favorites"" capability to be somewhat limited compared to the type of custom programming that's doable with remotes in the Philips ProntoPro line. Real headache came when I started to upgrade my program. Couldn't seem to get the revised program to download to both the remote and the extender. Two Emails to Logitech generated no response. Am seriously considering buying a second ProntoPro for the house and investing the hours to program it. I'm skeptical about any further modifications to the Harmony."
2,Disappointing,I was expecting this unit to work on my BOSE Lifestyle Unit which has an RF receiver. This was advertized as RF capable but that was not the case when I set it up. It referred to BOSE for another piece of equipment that BOSE doesn't even carry anymore.
4,Average Set up,"Took a while to set up. Software kept telling me to unplug, then re-connect USB cable. Tried calling Logitech support line. Gave up after 30 minutes on hold. Ended up fixing on my own. Works as I expected. Easy to use software. Works great overall and I recommend, but still just an overpriced remote control. Glad I bought on sale."
4,Review on Harmony 890,"Had trouble at beginning. Spent one and a half hours on phone with first line help and then 20 minutes with tier 2 to get unit working. Tried to add features on my own,couldn't get them to download, then spent 45 minutes with tier 2 where it was determined unit was defective. They immediately sent me out a new one. Got new one, programed it and it works great. I would recommend this for anyone who wants the RF feature of home theater remote control."
1,Look elsewhere,Product is poorly designed and doesn't even fit properly in its charging cradle. The remote would beep intermittently while in the cradle due to poor electrical contact. The first battery lasted less than 6 months and the second battery lasted less than 3 months. Replacement batteries are around $35-$40. The LCD started to fade in less than 1 year.The software is poor and always wants to connect to the RF Extender prior to programming the remote. This is a pain in the neck as the RF Extender is a cabinet with the A/V equipment and needs to be unplugged and connected to the computer.Logitech support has been completely unresponsive and I would never by another product from Logitech.
4,Good product but not for Dummies,"Once I got the right person on the phone to talk me through setup it went well. I tried to set it up but could not do it myself, I'm not a digit-head though so this stuff is difficult for me."
2,Good remote...poor RF extender,"I love Logitech remotes - I have two others already. I bought the 890 because I placed my components in a closet and needed a RF remote. I was very excited and anticipated this remote working smoothly. The problem I had was scrolling through the guide or recorded list on my Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300HD. Whenever I pressed the arrow once, it actually scrolled twice. It worked fine whenever I pointed the remote directly at the unit, but this was not reasonable since the unit was in a closet. After spending a day on the phone with support, they sent me another remote/extender - and I had the same problem. I finally bought the x10 Powermid and it works great with the remote sending a RF signal into the closet. Therefore, my recommendation would be to buy the Harmony 880 remote and the x10 Powermid. I love these remotes, but the RF extender needs a little more work."
4,The best remote I have used!,"This is the remote that I have bought after suffered years for so many remotes like 5 remotes in my room. This remote is very easy to setup. It can control like everything: it controls my HD-DVD, light, PC, Satelitte, and TV. I have bought the swith light come with a remote using Radio requency, and I don't know it can control this light or not. I have one light control by Infrared requency and the log 890 can control it, but I don't know that log 890 can control the light using radio requency or not, and I am trying to figure out, but I know it can control any Z-Wave devices! So I highly recommmed this product. Amazon gives a very good deal. If you buy this in Fry's, it costs $399."
4,Well worth the cheaper $$ on line,This is a very expensive remote in stores and other places I looked. The remote works well and is fairly simple. You do need to read the directions and will have to have internet access when programing it. The only thing I wish it has was Bluetooth since my PS3 is bluetooth only and not RF or IR.
5,Amazing,"I ordered this to control all my devices in my family room! I love it. Takes a little while to initially setup all the devices....but once they are setup, programming the activities is a breeze.I also have an external monitor in my eat in kitchen which receives the picture/audio from anything in the family room, so the RF was great! From the kitchen I can change the channel or control my DVD player, or Bluray player without a problem. and once i'm done eating, i just switch the activity to family room, and the kitchen tv turns off, and the family room tv turns on without disturbing the channel/movie i'm watching. it's really a great product!"
4,Harmoney Remote Makes Life Easier,"This was a christmas gift and he loves it...Easy to set up and works great, the only down fall is it doesnt control powering up the Wii.Its a great remote and a great gift idea for anyone."
3,How come the buttons are so small?,"I wanted a remote to control my home theater system consisting of an a/v receiver, HD-DVD player, SACD/DVD-Audio player, Panasonic front projector, Sony Wega tv, Motorola HD cable box, and Sony VCR. The Harmony 890 does all that, but the buttons are so small that using it is not intuitive like a well designed remote should be. Take the channel and volume buttons for instance: they are extra small and are located along the opposite edges of the remote, and you cannot locate them by feel. Even with the backlighting, I still have to look where to place my fingers. The remote took a few times to program correctly, but once I got it right, it works properly. My only complaint is that it leaves something to be desired in the ergonomics."
1,Defective Product,"Poor instructions make it difficult to program without assistance. I don't know if I just had a defective product or what, but when it was left overnight in it's charging cradle it would be locked up in the morning and the only way to ""reboot"" was to remove the battery. I have returned the device and purchased a Mastercontrol RFS200 made by Universal Remote Control and found this to be a much better product. It's easy to program because it doesn't connect to a computer for programing like the Logitech does.In addition, I had to contact Logitech support a couple times for programming support, and they were very helpful, but when I contacted them on the locking up problem they said I needed to be bumped up to their 2nd level of support who would contact me within 24 hours. I was never contacted so I returned the unit.The Logitech is a cool device that offers a lot of fancy options, if working correctly, but the problems I had made it more trouble than the fancy options are worth."
4,Harmony Remote 890 - Awesome,"I was hesitant to buy this remote because I read the reviews and many said that it was difficult to set up, that customer support was no good, firmware did not update. That must be the OLD Harmony - I got the 890 yesterday, and called customer support and THEY WERE AMAZING. The firware and software updates were a breeze, and customer support was unbelievable helpful - best tech experience I have ever had! The only reason I did not go 5 stars is becasue the remote itself is small and could use larger buttons."
2,Great when it works...,"I've had my 890 for about 4 years. Initial set-up takes hours if you want more than just a power toggle and volume control. Once a month or so, it starts dropping commands. Connecting it to my Mac corrects the problem, but why is there a problem? The directional toggle ""overshoots"" commands and the volume button is unreliable. Support ends at 90 days. The software interface is slow, cumbersome, and even after all these years, counter-intuitive. I know whenever I change a component, I've got at an hour+ of logitech-time to sort those issues out. Wish I'd saved my $$$.Logitech Harmony 890 Advanced Universal Remote Control"
1,Breaks after one year,"You will love this thing when you first get it. The programming interface is cool, and it works as expected. After about a year you will notice that some of the most used buttons (volume, channel, etc.) will require harder key presses. In a couple more months, some will become unusable. Logitech does not respond to warranty requests, so now you are out $300 for a remote. Don't take my word for it; search for Harmony 890 and you will see postings of people wanting to start a class action lawsuit because the issues are so prevalent and the company does nothing to resolve them.I recently bought a URC MX450 and it has been much better so far - heavier and more solid feeling and rubber buttons, not the cheapy plastic buttons on the 890. It's harder to program, but it is more solidly built. Go buy anything besides a Logitech product. This thing is garbage and they don't stand behind it. I will never give this company my money again."
2,Durability and design issues,"Biggest issues are the fact that this series of Harmony remotes has problems charging. I have both a 890 and a 880, and they both have the same issue. You cannot place the remote just into the charger to charge it. Typically, after cleaning the contacts on both the charger and the remote with Isopropyl Alcohol, you still need to add weight on the remote to have it charge. This has been a problem with the 890 since I bought the remote about 4 - 5 years ago. I bought the 880 about a year later and it started having the same problem after a while. Some of the buttons on the 890 have stopped working completely. Logitech doesn't support these remotes, at all. They do not offer a repair service just a discount on purchasing another iffy remote."
1,Logitech Harmony 890 Advanced Universal Remote Control,"Waste of good money. The remote buttons are screen are too small to view and use. Selecting/switching between activities is not accurate, most of the time you need to use the ""help"" and follow 2-3 more steps to set the activity properely. I do NOT recommend to spend monney on this remote."
1,Didn't work,"i tried for hours to get his to coordinate all of my remotes. I only had a Bose 1-2-3, Cablebox with DVR, and a Dell flat screen. it was difficult to determine exactly which my components were from the online list. i was afraid if I finally got it all to work together and something happened that i had to reprogram it i would be lost again. Amazon was great about the return, including shipping."
1,"Very hard to set up, just not worth it!","I bought 3 of these, but it just took forever to set up and was easier to use the original controls, I have them here sitting in their cradles and wished I could have returned them, but too late. Some things never got setup right and unless you are completely overboard, it's not worth it. Save your money!"
5,Remote Made a Believer of Me,"I have been skeptical of do all remotes. This remote is awsome. I use it to to control my 50"" DLP Sampson TV, Sampson DVD, Cox Cable Box, and Yamaha ampifier with Bose surround sound speakers. The controls are setup by connectiong the remote to my computer via USB port and then using the menu to select the commands. After setup it is so easy that my wife can use it. Not only can the various remotes be eliminated, but it ensures that the DLP TV is safely shut down."
4,DO NOT PAY $500 FOR THIS REMOTE,"You can find this remote for around $100 if you look around. I've owned one for several years and it works fine, bit it's definitely not worth $500."
4,Not perfect but not terrible.,"The key is to keep it charged and make sure your battery is healthy. once this remote is set up, it really is great to use. its easy to read the screen and easy to pair with your tv system. I actually have two (one for my home theater; one for my regular living room tv). Both systems have surround sound and my living room actually has a CD player attached. This remote makes all of the units seem like one functioning device. its awesome to use. I would recommend this remote to anyone who is looking for a seamless integration of all their tv units."
4,Pretty Good Remote,"This remote has worked well for me over the last couple of years. I recommend getting it at the lowest price possible since they have discontinued manufacturing it. Otherwise, go for a newer model.Pros:1. It works with a ""remote extender"" so that you can tuck your equipment in cabinets.2. I've been able to put all of my remotes (12) in a drawer and use just this one.3. Logitech continues to provide support (new devices and software upgrades).Cons:1. Setup can be lengthy and if you add anything new, you must update again -- both the remote and the extender.2. Every few weeks, it will not charge. Wiping the contacts in the cradle and on the device itself with a damp cloth fixes it for me. (YMMV)"
2,Charging Issues,"When this remote works, I love it. Very easy to control my home theater setup, although I wish that Logitech would add the ability to add some control when you push the OFF button (so I can have my lights ramp up).The issue I have, however, is a systematic charging / battery issue. Logitech has replaced my unit 4 times for the exact same issue: it just stops charging. I received the 5th unit in mid-June and it is already dead from the same issue. Logitech has finally decided to not replace it again, and instead offered me 50% a new remote. Given the issues I have had, I can tell you my next remote is NOT going to be an 890 and I am wondering if it will be a Harmony at all.My 880 on the other hand has had no issues at all."
3,"Short, but sweet life","For just over 24 months, the Logitech Universal Harmony Remote 890 was an elegant solution for managing the multitude of units in my entertainment center. On the positive side, it was intuitive and came with a downloadable desktop which allowed me to troubleshoot and update the remote's software. Most of the troubleshooting suggestions do resolve the most common problems, which is a very good thing as finding the Logitech customer support phone number or chat screen is impossible (I doubt it even exists there.) The remote worked well to manage everything from the Yamaha Soundblaster to the Panasonic plasma flatscreen to the IPod and TIVO recordings.The downside is Harmony's short life expectancy -- the LED screen didn't even outlast the battery. Consider yourself lucky if you do not have to replace the entire unit in 24 months, but Logitech will give you half off the price of a new one when you've tracked down their customer service number (866-291-1505.)"
1,Poorly designed - Unsupported after Warranty Expires,"Buttons are hard to push. After one year, commonly used buttons started to wear out - had to push very hard on narrow buttons to make work. Called, emailed Logitech several times - they would not replace product even though model failed nor could they even offer a service at my expense to repair. Offered refurb model at over $120. I am considering URC RFS200 wireless remote at $85 new. Appears to function in similar fashion with an extender in the closet with all of my A/V components. No longer a fan of Logitech products."
5,It's great.,"It takes some work to program it, but once you get it set up correctly, it's great...it controls some components that are behind a door, does everything correctly...very useful and convenient...you just have to have some patience when setting up."
2,the product that couldn't,"I purchased this product primarily for the RF functionality. After two purchases, countless calls to tech support, my hiring of a tech whose skills are superior to mine, and the loss of time and money, it doesnt work. I'm sad to say that Logitech Tech Support gave up on me.The remote works fine, but I cannot recommend the remote with the RF."
1,Logitech doesn't support their product,If you buy a Harmony remote do so at your own risk if you have a problem as the Harmony support is awful. I purchased this item and within 60 days it was defective. When I called Logitech they would not support or replace the defective unit. Thanks to Amazon I was able to replace it. I've owned two other Harmony remotes and always had good luck with them but their Customer Support has definitely changed for the worse. I would not recommend any Logitech product based on my experience.
1,I gave up,"I received a harmony 890 as a present in August. It worked great for 2 months. Then it just quit charging. Remote isn't much good if you can't charge it. LogiTech sent a new cradle - didn't work. To make a long story short LogiTech sent me 3 remotes (all refurbished) and 4 cradles. No combination of all these devices would work. The customer service people I dealt with were all very helpful and friendly, they just could not find one single remote that worked. Obviously their tech support that inspect the refurbished remotes leave a lot to be desired. Beware of refurbished - there is a reason they were returned in the first place."
1,Watch our for a nightmare!,"Logitech Harmony 890 Advanced Universal Remote ControlThe written claims for the product proved not to be true (RF does not work with Bose) even if I could have completed installation.I found this product nearly impossible to install. And, the technical support, while courteous, was totally inadequate. The out of the box instructions failed to work even after repeated tries. The support suggestions indicated that the approach I should have taken (nothing like the written instructions)included taking out the battery before plugging the USB connector, turning off my virus protection, and trying an alternative web approach. None of these worked. After four hours wasted trying to make this work I gave up. Way bad for a consumer product."
4,"Poor quality, but Z-Wave & RF make it unmatched","I've had two units, the first died after 5 months, the second (replaced by logitech) is starting the die. The screen will go blank, or redraw with lines everywhere making it impossible to read the screen. However, we bought a Z-Wave light dimmer specifically for this remote and there no other remotes with z-wave support (and are mac friendly) that I know of. So, I'll probably have to buy a 3rd 890 because i don't want to lose the ability to lower/raise and turn on and off our media room lights for the remote and render the dimmer purchase worthless. The 1000 had z-wave support but then dropped it and no other Harmony remote has come out with z-wave since the 890. RF is another great feature with the included extender.Harmonies are a breeze to configure on my mac (tho native software is now recommended over the web based version) I just wish for $300 they would last longer."
1,Don't waste your money,"This item works just fine. Until about 3 months after the warranty runs out. Then it will become an expensive paperweight.I have owned 2 of these and they both died inside 15 months. After doing some research it seems that this is standard. Logitech techs I have spoken to admit that the remote does tend to die ""in 18 months or so"".If you can afford to spend this kind of money for a remote that won't last two years then this is a great buy. To everybody else, buy an X10 icon remote (but don't pay more than $50). It is definitely NOT as good as the Harmony but it is so much cheaper."
2,"Good remote, but doesn't last","I really tried hard to make this remote work. WHEN it works, it's as advertised. But over two years, I went through several remotes, each of which had some sort of hardware malfunction. Finally, I gave up. I'm currently using the Monster equivalent (MONSTER MCC AVL300-S Home Theater & Lighting Controller 300 With Omnilink), which uses the familiar Harmony software--a huge plus. So far, no problems. I prefer the layout of its buttons; the display isn't nearly as nice as Harmony's. All in all, a push. But if it doesn't break every six months, it's a huge improvement over this model."
1,A losing battle,"I wish I had just thrown the $100 I spent on the Harmony Universal 600 in the trash. I would be no worse off and a lot less frustrated. The same intermittent problem that plagued its operation from the beginning still exists, despite untold hours of following the trouble shooting instructions and long threads of communication with their support people. Don't waste your money or your time on this piece of garbage device."
3,universal remote,"I was recommended to buy this item by my wall TV installer who said I could eliminate all my 5-other remotes. In general it does, however, it does not work as expected on my Sony DVD recorder since it does not have all the options (buttons) as the Sony remote has for ease of recording. It tries to, but doesn't have the necessary options as the remote that comes with the DVD recorder. Also, the touch buttons are at the bottom of the remote and the casing is very slick making it slippery and can be dropped easily, and if on a hard floor, can damage the remote. If all you want to do is watch TV its pretty easy to use and learn what buttons to click, but anything more elaborate you are better off using your other remotes. Maybe if I spend more time on the webpage I may discover more of its capabilities. But on the other hand, keep batteries in all your other remotes just in case."
1,do not reccomend,I bought two of these units both did not work well or work very long. I do not reccomend this product for purchase
5,Best Rmote Ever Used,"The Harmony 880 and 890 remotes are the first multi-device remotes that have truely allowed me to pack up all the factory remotes and store them away. After the harmony units are programmed, which is a breeze, these remotes work flawlessly."
1,Completely unable to make this work. A waste of money.,"We are technophiles. We have lots of gadgets and we are good at getting them to talk to each other. I have personally set up more than 5 universal remotes, and do not think that it is a difficult process in general. I have programmed many buttons, I have run cables, I have played with dongles. I have definitely made my way around remote controls, and I was very excited about the potential of this remote.I can't comment at all about how well this remote works because I could never get it to work. I went through the set up process three separate times, and my father in law (a computer professional with 8 computer related patents under his belt!) couldn't get it to work either. Logitech's tech folks were never able to find out why I couldn't sync up despite much time with them.In the end, I gave up in disgust. Wasted money. It is still sitting in my living room, mocking me. If you purchase this, I wish you better luck than I had."
3,Logitech Harmony 890 Does Not Support Z-Wave RF Yet,"The Logitech Harmony 890 is an exceptional universal remote. The screen and it's programability are great. It takes some practice to use the online programing system. However, when one gets use to the online programing system, it is easy to use. It does need some serious usability improvements.Now the bad part. Logitech promotes this universal remote as supporting Z-Wave home control devices. As of this date, (25 Sept 06) that support does not exist. I have asked several times when the support will be availible. I have received no response. The lack of Z-Wave support and the lack of response from Logitech is really annoying!"
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"I ended up returning the Harmony 890 for a refund. It almost did everything I needed, but it could not do one critical task that made it useless. What it could not do was select the proper video inputs on my Samsung DLP bigscreen. So, I still had to do this manually (using the Samsung remote -- thus defeating the purpose of buying a universal programmable remote).An email to Logitech asking for help elicited no response. None. I was pretty surprised. I am fairly technical and I could see in the program listing of internal commands that the unit was sending out the wrong command. But, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to go in and change it. So, I emailed support. And, never heard anything back.I had high hopes for this product. I rarely return products -- usually I can get them to do want what I want. But, in this case, I gave up and just returned it."
2,890 Packaging misleading,"I have devices located in different rooms (TV in one room, mini-system in another etc.) and I was looking for a remote that could control these devices independent of each other. If you look at the packaging of the 890, it clearly shows an activity bar called Living Room Activities and an Activity called Change Room. The 890 is NOT capable of setting up devices/activities by room. According to Logitech technical support, if you want to do this, you will need the 890 Pro, not the 890.With the 890, you can tell it to leave other devices on when selecting an activity, but this means if you select the Watch DVD activity and then later select the Watch TV activity, it will leave the DVD player on. Logitech's recommendation is to then push the Device button, then select DVD and then select Off. As I stated in the heading, the packaging is misleading. It shows features (grouping activities by room, changing rooms) the 890 is not capable of doing."
1,No Harmony about it,"Great idea, poor follow through. Got the remote to download properly after a few hours, but the Infa-red portion never worked. Sent e-mail to Logitech, they responded after I opted to return item (took 4 days for return e-mail)"
4,Value for the money.,890 works great for a one room one zone unit. For more zones choose the Pro. I own both. Good support.
5,GREAT REMOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have the older model harmony 720 and up graded to this one. We love it! The features to customize what you want the remote to do are wonderful! I would buy this again and would tell anyone to buy one also!! GREAT PURCHASE!!!!
5,"Expensive, but worth every penny.","I found the Logitech Harmony 890 Remote to be easy to set up, easy to operate and trouble-free. Although expensive, its outstanding design and the interactive setup software support the old adage, ""You get what you pay for."" I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to control components that are kept out of view. If you components are all line-of-sight, permitting IR control, don't waste your money. It is the 890's superb RF capability which sold (and continues to sell) me."
4,Not too shabby,I've had this remote for about 2 months now and it's great. It does take awhile to set up but once you get it going it's wonderful to control equipment hidden in closets or behind cabinets. The only thing I would have liked more is if you could control more devices and I do have some problems with the recharging cradle at times. Other than that no real complaints. It's great to be able to turn on different entertainment systems throughout the house with one press of a button (once its all programmed of course) and once fully recharged it lasts for days!
5,Ultimate Universal Remote,"This remote takes some time and tech knowledge to set-up, but once it's installed and configured, anyone can use it to watch TV, Movies, or listen to the radio."
3,Harmony 890,"The first remote wouldn't hold the program. I took me 2 days with customer service to figure out the remotes memory was bad. The second remote they sent took the programming on the 1st try. I works good now, but I am contantly trying to tweak it. Over all I satisfied with the remote. I am pretty tech saavy, but it is a little confusing to program due to there website is not that intuitive. Also, they should have seperated the TIVO FF button from the advance to end button a little more because I constantly jump to the end of the show instead of FF threw commercials. But it does operate a lot of my equipment and I would buy it again."
3,Universal Remote Control,"The remote looks really nice. It takes some time to have it programmed but it is not too complicated. It is a bit ""buggy"" and I already had to re-program mine after having it for 3 months. The battery doesn't last too long so it needs to charge every couple of days."
5,fantastic,"This unit work flawless. Lots of forethought went into design and the setup and update system is 100%. I 've setup my duaghters with one and it save a lot of ""How do I"" phone calls... Everyone needs one."
2,OK but the low end models are better,"I bought this remote to replace a 4 series from logitic. The docking station has been a pain in the butt, it you dont sit it just right it wont charge correctly and it will actual drain the battery. I love the logitic remotes I just think for the price I should like this one a lot better then my cheap one, well I dont. Buy a low model."
3,Great features IF you never EVER drop it,"I don't have much to add to all the other reviews EXCEPT,Between my wife and child, the remote gets dropped about 1 a month (2feet or less) and causes one of the following:a. take out battery to rebootb. put back on charger to ""jump start""c. all out have to re program remoteNow I realize that it was not designed to be dropped, but it is a remote for heaven sakes, it bound to happen at some point."
2,When it works...it's great,"I bought one, it wouldn't charge, then bought another, and it charges some of the time. Setup wasn't too bad, a little buggy but if you spend a little time on it it will work. Once set up, it worked like a charm. But the charging is horrible. I read the reviews and bought anyway, which was a mistake. Once in the cradle, it will charge for about 5 minutes, then it stops, it's madening!!!! If you could use normal batteries, I rate this higher. Save your money until Logitech does better QA."
1,No good - very disappointed,"Very disappointed with this remote. Returning it to Amazon today. After 1 hour of attempting to setup, we found it would not work with 2 (newer) components we have. And the ones it DID work with, acted very cumbersome. Had to scroll thru 4 screens to fast foward our DVR. Back another 2 screens to control volume. Some fuctions would not work no matter what I tried. Going back to my $30 universal that does what I need and doesnt need a rocket scientist to set it up."
3,Too pricey for the amount of work involved.,"Its a great tool, but is kind of a pain in the rear to set up. If your tv or other items have a stand by time (some tvs need like 30 seconds to 'warm up')it becomes frustrating to go back and forth to adjust and download the correct programming. Mine is still not working properly and so far I have found it to be a waste of money. The customer service help hasnt been very helpful at all either."
2,Replaced it twice and it still don't work!,I like this remote....when it works.For th eprice i would think that they make a remote that can last longer than 6 months.I had to replace it twice and the 3rd time it broke I just gave up on it. Instead by the logitech rf extender and use another brand of remote
3,Remote was great for 2 years,"2 Years to the day from when I ordered it, the LCD display went blank (but the backlight was on). Considering the the $200+ price tag, you would expect the remote to last a bit longer than 2 years. At least I got a year's worth of use after the warranty expired.EDIT: This is a problem plaguing a number of customers (do an internet search). One time, removing the battery and re-inserting it fixed the problem for about a week. The remote is still usable as look as you memorized the basic functionality and press the Activities button then then the activities button. It's a royal pain.I did exchange a couple emails with Logitech. Since it's out of warranty, they aren't replacing, but they are giving me 50% off a remote bought from their store. Better than nothing.EDIT: I had purchased a replacement board from eBay and it's working again."
5,Clicker love,"This clicker is amazing! Love it! Seriously, you have control of the TV, DVD, radio all in one device. Worth the money. No more frustration with numerous clickers."
4,"Great Item, but a bit complicated","I needed to get my more tech saavy brother to help on this, and I'm typically able to connect basic electronics, etc.. I think if you get it installed correctly, it's well worth the price for what it can do for you. I'm still working on getting it to be a more smooth operation when switching from one component to another and from the sattelite dish to the dvr, and back to the volume, but at the end of the day, I recommend this item."
1,Harmony 880 Less Than Perfect,"I purchased the Harmony 880 remote about 8 months ago and the battery refuses to hold a charge anymore. There are a hundred tiny buttons of which 3 never worked at all and another 4 were sticky. Fortunantly, the ones that never worked were for special tasks that I rarely used. Once programmed, it worked OK, but the small buttons make it very hard to select specific channels. Even though I connected it through the Logitech site and downloaded the codes for my equipment, it did not correctly map functions to my Sony reciever and I had limited functionality with the Sony DVD player. Alot of money for limited functionality and lousy battery life."
5,Best remote out!!,Easy set up! Easy to use and learn. Was thinking about touch screen but went with this insted and it was a great choice.
5,Best Remote EVER!,"After receiving this remote as a gift two years ago, I'm not sure if I could live w/out one now. The biggest problem was that after almost 2 years, the display conked out on me. The remote worked fine but there was no display making it very difficult to navigate. I called customer support - they gave me the generic ""Your remote is our of warranty (12 mos) so there's nothing we can do - you can purchase a new one for 1/2 price."" Well paying $200+ every 2 years for a remote seemed a bit expensive so I took a step further and asked for warranty support - the lady there was AMAZING. About 5 mins of sobbing (not literally) and praising the product and how I couldn't live w/out it must have done the trick - THEY SENT ME A BRAND NEW ONE! I truly love this remote and this company - amazing product, amazing customer service - a joy to work with, I will continue to buy products from Logitech FOREVER!"
5,All you could want,"Not only is the product everything that it purports to be but the customer service was fantastic. I had a problem with my old BOSE surround sound, which uses RF not IR and the customer service people downloaded additional software to make it work. It is easy to use and feels good to to the touch as well."
4,Very good but could be improved,"I really like my Logitech Harmony 890. It is a great product and I got it at a great price. The only trouble I have with it is that the number pad at the bottom is hard to use. For example, when changing to a specific channel on the TV I have to hold the remote with one hand and press the buttons with the other. I have been told that the Logitech Harmony One is an improvement on this issue."
3,"Worthwhile, but could be easier to use","I am generally happy with my Harmony 890 universal remote (which I purchased on the basis of Walt Mossberg's review in the Wall Street Journal), but I found the setup to be somewhat challenging, requiring several rounds of tinkering online (and a little help from one of my sons) before all aspects were working properly. Now that it is up and running properly, it has replaced four other remotes, which was my goal, but the lettering on the buttons and even on the screen is so tiny and faint (or obscured by background graphics) that I doubt that my wife will ever do more with it than turn the TV on and off and change channels (which took two remotes before)."
4,"Great, but not perfect","I had a Harmony several years ago and it was just OK. It didn't do real well working with a Mac OS, this one does just fine. It is nice to have a charger on this one. It is a bit time consuming to set up and then having to fine tune, but it has been working as advertised for a couple of weeks now. It is a hassle to unplug the remote sensor and lug all of it to your computer, but that is the only downside. Would I recommend purchasing this remote? Yes, and I would do it again. Larry"
3,Setup can be difficult!,"The Harmony 890 Advanced Universal Remote does have easy online device codes that configure the remote. Setting up the various component combinations can be difficult and trial and error techniques are required,ie. getting the television to come on and have it go to the proper input mode such as cable, blu-ray or hd mode in one move can be challenging to say the least. I am sure however that this device can do all that it says but I simply dont have the hours of time that it would take to program it. I did not care fot the small sized mode buttons and for the price I would much rather have a touch screen remote that can clearly be seen."
5,Universal Remote by Logitech works great!,"Finally, a universal remote that works. Sure, it was a bit of a hassle to program it, but I expected that it would take some effort. All in all, it is as advertised and more . . . you can put away all those other remotes."
4,Logitech Harmony 890,"Wireless portion of remote works good, with good range. Programming is a pain in the xss, as on-line interface is convoluted and often doesn't provide an acceptable way to back up from the previous step. Software does a lousy job of administering when you have multiple remotes. (I have three... 2 880's, 1 890) There is no good or reasonable excuse for the state of the web software, but if you gut it out and spend the time, the remote works well."
2,Only 10 favorites? Why?,"I'd have put more but Amazon keeps deleting posts that they don't like.So I'll submit this again, and if you read it, it got through the filter.10 favorites. That's all I've got to say.If this doesn't mean something to you, this is a good remote and a good value.If it does, you shouldn't buy it because the remote is overpriced for what you get."
1,Crappy... Box was missing the Software and USB cable,Crappy... Box was missing the Software and USB cableWould not recommend buying from them again
1,"Don't buy this product--good idea, needs to be Beta tested","I bought this remote to control my home theater..the first remote did not work right out or the packeage. I returned the product to the store where I bought and exchanged for a second one. after two weeks, the remote will not work or keep a charge.Software is buggy, firmware out if date. Logitech support is the weakest I have ever seen. if this were a $40 item rather than a $400.00 Item, I would expect this."
3,disapointed,"The remote is a great idea, it is very difficult to get programmed on my computer. I have to disconnect my internet router, and they thy 3-5 times to get the remote programed.It then does all the things it is advertised to do."
2,Logitech Remote,"The remote seems OK, but it doesn't totally control my TV setup. In fact, I would like to return it. Can you send me the information that I need to do so? Thank you. Frank"
3,Harmony 890 Review,"After owning the remote for over a month it still dosne operate correct. I need to call the help desk instead of trying to fix it myself. It wont operate unless it has a direct sight of the receiver. so much for RF? And it never turns on/off all the units when supposed to. I'm sure its a simple correction, Im not giving up yet."
1,Dont waste your time!!,As I type this I am also boxing this up to send back to Amazon. This is a terrible product and worse off their Customer Service was rude and completely useless. I've spent enought time trying to troubleshoot and now it's being returned. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1,It doesn't really work,"As a lot of different ""nice"" devices where the hardware is ok but the software simply sucks, I was thinking this would be just one more of them.The software hangs very often and I needed to restarted it several times and reconnet the RC to the PC several times and went through different unpleasent situations like having your RC hang just saying ""go to the web site for update"" or ""configuration corrupted"" until it finally got configured. I was almost concluding this is just one more nice hardware with a poor software and then I found out that the one the buttons (the right direction one) just doesn't work for any of my devices (TV, DVD and Xbox).I'm returning it and will give it a second shot - perhaps I was just unlucky and a new device will be ok. I really doubt it since I don't believe the software will work any better with a new device. So this would fix only the hardware problem, if so...My recommendation is: Don't buy it. You can't trust it will really work."
1,"I changed my mind, it is ready for prime time!","Well I've had this remote for about 18 months now and during that time Logitech has steadily improved the firmware for this product so that it's now pretty stable and works well. I also recently had an incident where the LCD on the remote stopped working, who know why. I got a prompt response from Logitech customer service with some initial steps to perform. After the LCD still did not work, Logitech replaced it. Good job Logitech, you stand behind your products, steadily improve them and provide a good deal of support. If you need RF capabilities then buy this product, it's now easy to set up, it's stable and a great company stands behind it."
1,World's most frustrating software,"The setup process is a disaster. Although I entered the exact model number for my Tivo Series 3, it didn't recognize it. However, it doesn't tell you it doesn't recognize it until after its too late to go back. There's no way to restart setup either and because the information is stored online, a reinstallation of the software . It just plows through the setup aimlessly with the wrong information, configuring things in the wrong way."
2,Sleek Design; Horrible software/firmware,"I had used various Logitech products the last fifteen years. I invariably found them well designed and easy to use. I had one of their earlier Harmony remotes, which was a breeze to set up. I thought all the bad reviews were written by novices who are not that computer literate. I was wrong.I spent half a day cycling through various upgrades with one of the buggiest softwares I have seen in twenty years. The key issue is to upgrade the firmware of the wireless extender first. The software that comes with it gets you hung up. So be prepared for some frustration.Once you get everything set up it works well.On the plus side, I was delighted to find an arcane set top box listed on the menu."
2,"EXCELLENT Remote, Software is a disaster","How Logitech gets away with delivering such phenomenal hardware and such ridiculously poor software is beyond me. If you've got a relatively simple setup, go for it! If you plan on doing any customizations, block off the day on your calendar."
1,Terrible service,"After being on hold for more than an hour, I finally got someone on the phone at Logitech. The person was clearly not fit to handle technical support. I asked to speak to a very condescending supervisor who told me that setup should be easy. When I asked him to walk me through a couple of steps, he then said: oops, I don't know about the 890. This a Tier 2 question. What the heck was that supposed to mean? So they were completely unhelpful. I then emailed Logitech. Got a response 3 days later. Was helpful. Finally got the remote to work. But found a few more glitches. The inputs were not switching when I changed activities. Again, I emailed Logitech but now 4 days later, I have yet to receive a reply. I am returning this product. Stay away!"
3,Good but tricky,"Good overall in IR area, the RF still has to be worked on for setup. The control commands could have been better."
4,Life is good,"I am very happy with this remote. It does not work my fireplace, but everything else seems to be working well. I think if you buy this remote, you should have at least a decent understanding of computers. The remote is set up via a USB cable from my PC and it takes a little getting used to, but once you do. It works well."
4,They stand behind their product,"My Harmony 890 was not holding its charge, even after having been placed in the recharger overnight.Discussed the problem with Logitech customer service; together with their tech we tried many things to detect/correct the problem.In the end, Logitech chose to replace the unit; I'm a happy camper because they stood behind their product.The replacement works just fine."
4,Easy Setup!,"The setup was extremely simplified. I can appreciate Logitech programming the remote and the IR blaster for me and relieving me of the pain. I have the following equipment located in an electronics closet. The blaster works effectively on all my equipment, with the exception of the CD player. Due to the somewhat smaller size of the closet and larger size of the CD player I needed to use one of the four supplied emitters. But, the emitter does work well:Yamaha RXV 1000Motorola Digital Video RecorderSony 5 Disk Carousel DVDSony 400 Disk CD JukeboxJVC VHS player (I can't let go.)Nakamichi Cassette Deck (Non remote controlled but again, I can't let go.)The wife loves it because within two steps, she's up and in full operation. My only minor qualm is that the Harmony 890 is sometimes slow to respond with my DVR and DVD player.Definitely worth the money!"
4,Rock Solid Remote,"I have bought two of these units and am anxiously awaiting it's upgrade with the Harmony One (with RF)because that would be the best remote on the market. Would have given this a 5 star rating, but Logitech still has some tweaking to do with their software setup. It takes you a while to learn all of its quirks. Would recommend this remote to anyone."
2,remote review,"Plus:- Easy web interface to program several actionsMinus:- Very crowded and small keys. ( Number, vol, channel keys )- No color-coded keys.Conclusion:I would not purchase this control. I do wish the new Harmony One from Logitech had color-code keys."
4,Great remote but crappy button,"Pro: good looking. Full functions as advertised. It has the RF which is very useful for non-lineofsight control. Color screen with customized TV channel icon is a big plus. The RF delay is adjustable. Make sure you change it as the default values are too large, making control sluggish. It even has my cheap Konka TV/ matiaDVD player pre-configured. Very nice!Con: Mostly minor issues. A. I don't think the shape is the best for one-hand operation. Hard to presee some buttons with only one hand. B. One of the buttons near the screen does not ""click"", although it is working so I can live with it. I heard my friend's got a bad number button as well. Poor quality control from logitech on such an expensive gadget. Make sure you check all your buttons! C. the charging contact is at the bottom of the unit. Make me feel unsafe, in case I put it on a metal surface, that I may short the battery inside :("
3,Pretty Good Overall,"Good remote replacing lots of other remotes. Software a bit tedious at first but easy to manipulate and set up the different remotes and their functions. Havent set up the RF on it yet, but IR seems to function well (some delay but not too bad). Am not a huge fan of some of the button sizes and feel when pressing. Tried the 720 and liked that much better for look, button placement and feel. If you dont need/want the RF, would recommend the 720 over the 880."
1,Too many bugs,"I've had this remote for about 6 months and still can't get it function 100% correct. Many, many hours online. Many, many contacts with their customer support. It just doesn't work properly. Ultimately, it is overpriced and under supported. Customer support was woefully poor. Never once were they able to help. It's not complete junk, but for the price, it's close. This should work perfectly without headaches and hours of troubleshooting. But it doesn't. It just doesn't.I finally did figure out how to get the remote to work properly. I had to delete everything and start from scratch. It was extra work, but it was the only way."
1,Doesn't Last,"I bought the 890 just over a year ago and like many other people's remotes I have discovered (thank you, Google), mine suffered the same fate. The screen goes blank. It will light up but no icons or text appear. You can take the battery out for 10 min, reinsert it and the screen will work for a few hours to a few minutes but then it goes out again. The problem seems to get progressively worse.I do not recommend this remote!"
1,Only for the bold,"I've had this remote for about a year. If you are a true expert with electronic gadgets, willing to spend considerable time (>2hrs) working through a complex maze of programming steps, enjoy spending 10's of minutes waiting on-line for tech support help or drafting long complicated emails when the enevitable problems arise, are not daunted when the product doesn't work as advertised, then this product is for you because, when it works, it is an excellent product.Already I've had the well-known charging problem. The pain and agony getting through this with a new charger is half a book. Now the new charger has arrived and solves the charging problem, but now my extender won't upload the new settings. Here we start the entire cycle again.The bottom line is that I would never have purchased such an expensive item had I known how poor the service was and difficult it was to use.lww"
4,"Great Remote, much better than the 880",I had an 880 for 3 weeks then returned it because of IR range issue's. While the 890 may look like the 880 it is a totaly different remote in terms of IR range and stability. The 880 had a very narrow IR beam that was only reliable at 10-12ft while the 890 has about twice the range and a much wider angle. The 880 had a well known bug in the tilt sensor mechanism and charging cradle but the 890 does not have either of these problems. Couple those pluses along with the RF module and it is a much better value than the 880.
1,Overpriced,The first one I got was DOA. After wasting several hours with tech support. Logitech would not refund my shipping and are requiring me to ship the old one back at my cost.The buttons are too small and not very intuitive.This is also really overpriced for what you get.Not impressed.
2,Not what I expected,I purchases this item based on all the reviews I read. When I received it I was expecting something a littler larger. I had a hardtime configuring it with my cox cable box and TV. After numerous attempts I just packed it back up and sent it back to amazon.
1,Unable to connect to my PC,"I worked with Logitech support, an exercise in patience, and it did work - once. However, subsequent times the PC would never connect to the remote via the USB cable. I am a computer savvy person, and I'm quite sure I was doing things right. It just didn't work."
2,Keep it simple or else....,"I have a Sony TV, Pioneer Receiver, Xbox 360 and Dish Network.1) I set up the remote and followed all the directions2) Everything looked right, but didn't work right3) I got part of it to work (never the Xbox 360 on a consistent basis)4) wife was annoyed with the Dish network interface, always complainedI was going to return, but 30 days had elapsed; I decided to use in a different room a couple of months later, and decided I would do it right, but the software doesn't work right. For example, it'll say activity, but then the activity won't show up on the remote; I had to delete everything and restart everything, then it worked; but even then...after five hours, it still didn't work...or control my Pani plasma.I dislike this remote; I ended up getting Control4, which is a really great remote, and even works from very far away and through walls; I'm still going to try to get it to work...but I've neglected my family too many hours to get this freakin' thing to work right."
2,Poor Support and Lockups,"I love the unit...when its working...software problems in the beginning and was transferred to ""upper level"" support who told me I should replace my new Dell XPS 600...I eventually fixed the problem...then frequent lockups...emailed tech support...responded in 24 hours with a test which I performed immediately and emailed back the results...two days later and no response...called customer support who stated that they were sending out new unit in two days...four days later got an email that Logitech was processing the order and that the new unit would be delivered in 5-7 business days...All my equipment is in a remote location so I must go to other room to change channels, volume input etc. Logitech doesn't seem to care...I'm presently on the phone waiting for tech support and have been holding for 20 minutes thus far...Good luck if you buy this one...."
2,It's not as simple as it sounds,"I purchased this product to control my home theater components that are hidden away in a closet. I have a pretty complicated set-up, that includes a video switcher and multiple components. The included software CD seems to program the remote pretty easily (works on a Mac or PC) but after everything is programmed, it just wouldn't work. It's one of those things you would need to mess with for a couple of 8 hour days to get everything timed and working right. I never called Tech Support, I just sent it back and gave up. I ended up going with the Next Generation Remote Extender - it's about $30 on Amazon and I highly recommend it if you just need to control components that are not within line of sight."
4,No more confusion about inputs,"We recently switched to using the Harmony 890 and it makes using all of our components much easier....no more remembering what to set the inputs to for certain devises....no more leaving the cabinet door open to change the volume on the receiver. Easy to use, easy to correct issues. Only problem is that the remote doesn't work all of our dvr functions properly....I just need to take the time to call Logitech and talk to the service department. As a note...it did take my brother in law (who lives for this kind of stuff) quite a while to set up."
1,would not purchase again,I purchased a Harmony remote for hundreds of dollars and have had to have it replaced 2 times. I will be on my third (refurbished) one and will never purchase again! Both times had problems charging unit.
4,Nice Hardware - Setting up can be tricky,I purchased the 890 to control all of my media devices. I found the setup software to be a little to automatic. If you dont have to tweak your remote it is great. What I found is that I had to tweak most of my devices using my original remotes from the devices. I have Yamaha products and they always have problems with other remotes. It took a while to get everything to work but now works great. I use the remote to control devices that are inside of a cabinet using the RF extender and at the same time can control my tv using the IR feature. I also loaded some of my jpeg images as a screen background which was really cool. Over all I really like the remote and am planning on buying 3 more.
5,Best remote out there for the money,"I bought this product in Oct 2006. I downloaded the latest version of the software from Logitech's web site. This is the best remote I've ever had. I replaced a Pronto 1000 (which was also a great remote). I was able to program my 6 different components very easily. The logitech database didn't have the discrete codes for the inputs to my television, but I was able to have the remote learn them easily. While it took me a week to get the Pronto working the way I liked. It only took an hour to get this remote completely working. The only annoyance is that you have to reprogram the base and the remote whenever you make a change to the program. In my setup that's not that easy to do. They could have made it easier if the power supply was detactable, but they didn't. So when I reprogram the remote I have to dig in the back of the television to unplug the base unit. But it's worth it. I had no problems with software."
2,Had to send it back.,"tI cant tell you much. I had to send this one back for a replacement. After programming it from my computer, it kept losing the programming after about 30 seconds. After speaking with Logitech Customer Service for about four hours we determined the remote was defective and I needed to send it back. Will let you know how the second one works."
3,Good remote but not sure about how long it will last,"I have Harmony 880 which is similar in design to this one. I am happy with this remote. It works great. Problem I am seeing after one year of use is, the Channel Up button is not working as expected. I have to press it really hard before I can actually change the channel. And I am sure it is going to happen with all similar buttons such as Ch-, Vol+, Vol-, Prev, Mute.Adding review here as well so that user can know facts."
3,Great Remote - Bad Software,"While the product functions great, the software leaves little to be desired. I use a mac and the software is just painful to use. The ability to add and manage numerous devices required the entry and exit of the software for each device. Maybe it's just my usage - but we use this remote to control devices in multiple rooms.Once you get out of the software, the remote works great - we've only encountered a couple of areas where we had to go back and add functions to the remote."
1,very confusing to program,"received quickly, but way to complicated to program and the price that it is, its not worth the headache at all"
1,Harmony 890 remote,"The quality of the product is highly questionable. I have two remote and it takes forever to re-program. The first one I bought for living room, doesn't turn on the the system and I have to repeatedly keep pressing the Watch TV button. The change channel button does'nt work well either. The one for the basement never worked right and had to be reprogrammed repeatedly.TW just replaced the DVR with a whole house DVR and the remote would not work. So I tried to reprogram the remote and was with their tech support for over 95 minutes and they couldn't help. Tried using different laptops and hard wire connection with firewalls turned off and still no help.They need to improve the quality of the product as well as their software."
4,Pretty good,"I'm mostly happy with this remote. I keep my DVD, DVR and stuff hidden away in a closet. This remote plus the extender thingus (also in the closet) allow me to control them from anywhere in the house. Life is a little simpler.On the down side, this remote isn't so good at controlling my televisions. I have three TVs in three separate rooms that all display the same thing. It's pretty convenient as I walk around the house. However, the remote isn't good at switching between televisions while leaving the DVR and DVD player alone. When I switch from ""DVD Bedroom"" to ""DVD Main Room"" all I want is for the remote to continue control the DVD (as it already was) and to switch over to controlling the main room TV. Instead it tries powering up the DVD (causing it to restart the disk) and rarely powers up the TV.I have yet to find a way to bypass the logitech ""wizard"" for programming the remote. The wizard is far too limiting."
5,"Great remote, great experience on a return","I purchased this remote at the end of December 2008 from Amazon. Setup was very easy when connected to my PC for the updates, step by step software, etc. Everything works as advertised including being able to walk outside and use the RF on my patio for Zone 2 on my receiver. Very convenient.However, I am writing about Logitech's customer service. The display slowly started to fail, and eventually stopped working all together. Hold time at 7PM CDT was only about 3-4 minutes, and 5 minutes later I had a new remote on the way!5 stars for having a good product AND backing it up."
1,Bad information from Logitech,"Logitech on their website says that this will control Bose. It will not and after many calls to Logitech and speaking to their ""technicians"" they finally admitted that Bose has a proprietary RF signal. I spent way too long trying to fix a problem that they said would not be a problem."
1,Twice tried and failed,Got one RF worked. reprogram some buttons and reprogram then RF never works again. it pairs fine but doesnt respond. Got another one from amazon (amazon rules) this one doesnt even show RF options on the remote. return again. still looking for good RF solution
1,Simple Waste Easy to Program Impossible to Customize,The harmony 890 remote has a great shape and is very easy to program and use. The repeater system works quite well and will make it possible for you to hide your equipment.A major drawback is that advanced programming is out of the question. Logitech uses a web based program and they have made up your mind on how the device is to be programmed. What I mean is since it was designed to be so easy to use they have made it impossible to correct mistakes in their programming. Simply put the software used to program this remote effectivley reduces the device to a good $80 universal remote with a $80 IR repeater system.Great Job... For $400 and a lit lcd you would think they would have found a middle to high end theater universal remote
1,difficult,"The Logitech 890 is very difficult to set up. When you speak to a tech via the telephone, the tech has broken english and is difficult to understand. The purchase of this item was not worth my effort. Look for a better remote."
3,"It works, not anything amazing though","It's great that Logitech put up a database online. Everything I needed was right there, but I think you should be able to download what you need and then work from your computer instead of a logitech server. I have to kill my router firewall every time I reconfigure. The remote does generally work perfectly. Its definitely nicer than the IR PDA program I was using before."
1,"Don't buy this, will break within one year and good luck getting a replacement","I purchased the Harmony 890 about 11 months ago for use with my home theater and bedroom LCD. It worked very well for about 11 months and I was close the purchasing an additional unit for another room.Last week anything using the IR portion of the remote stopped working, devices uses the RF (remote extender) continue to work fine.I called Logitech's version of ""Customer Support"" and tried to get a replacement. The support process requires several days of firmware updates, pointing a digital camera at the remote IR, etc., etc., to qualify for Harmony 890 replacement. ""Customer Support"" will force you to call back after you have gone through their steps, talk to a new ""Customer Support"" and repeat the troubleshooting over and over. After you do this their ""Warranty Department"" will review your request to see if you are worthy.Do not buy!!!"
3,hohum,Ken Davis- very funny as always and the ventriloquist was also very good. We're sorry to say the rest was hohum.
4,"Very, very funny!","This is a great DVD. We watched it with our teenaged daughter and we all thought it was really funny. Only a couple of ""slow"" spots, but if you stay with it through those brief segments, it just gets better and better. A great evening of truly clean and truly funny material awaits you! Well worth the money."
5,What a hoot!,"By the end of this DVD, I was in tears (of laughter)! Good clean fun, most totally enjoyable. I have watched it 3 times now and gave it as a gift to a parent of a child in my Sunday school class. Thoroughly and undeniably enjoyable!"
1,"Cool idea, BUT...","This device has lots of problems. The customer support was not very good either. We had difficulty setting up the wifi access when we got it. Customer support provided no help at all. We finally figured it out on our own. The software constantly freezes, often requiring rebooting. The last straw was today when all of the applications disappeared from the desktop. We'll take our refund and purchase a laptop."
2,Not what I expected,"After receiving this very thin book, I still gave it a chance and started reading. Within the first 2 pages it starts talking about honoring Him and that's not what I was looking for in this book. Great title, but very religious. Its not that I'm not religious, I just don't prefer to read it in a book like this."
4,It was a good book....,I thought the book was good averall but because I am not really in to reading religious books I found it a bit boring. The overall concept was good but I thought it would be more like a story without all the religious things in it. I would recommend it to those who like to read religious books.
1,Medals Above My Heart: The Rewards Of Being A Military Wife,I never received this product. I had to file a dispute with the credit card company
2,OK,"I have this book and have gone through a 22 month deployment as a Milspouse. I did not like this book. Too heavy, I suggest lighter reading for a military wife."
5,The Best of the Best,"There are no better kitchen knives available than Ontario's ""Old Hickory"" line. Fancier? yes. Easier to take care of? Most definitely. But, none better. ""Old Hickory"" knives are ""cutters"" from the old school.To me, the ""star"" of the ""Old Hickory"" is the 8-inch slicing knife. It has to be the best cutting knife of all of the ""Old Hickory"" knives due to its superior balance and blade length. In this regard, the slicer is just slightly better than the 6-inch boning knife, in my opinion. In a pinch, a slicer, a boning knife and a skinning knife (great for chopping vegetables) would be just about all of the ""big knives"" that most ""home cooks"" would ever really need. The addition of a couple of paring knives would make up a ""kit"" that would be hard to beat as a ""bare bones"" knife set."
1,A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,"Maduro's book is a typical example of an ""environmental backlash"" diatribe. He presents numerous examples of what he interprets to be flaws in the ozone depletion theory, yet despite the fact that the book goes on for 356 pages, Maduro cannot refute these simple indisputable facts which connect CFCs to ozone depletion:1) Most chlorine in the stratosphere is of man-made origin (CFCs).2) Chlorine becomes reactive towards ozone at low temperatures in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds which occur only over Antarctica in the wintertime. Contrary to Maduro's evidence, it is well established that ozone depletion has only been observed in the time since CFCs achieved high concentrations in the atmosphere (1970s to present).Therefore, simple logic dictates that man-made CFCs cause ozone depletion."
4,An engrossing read,"This book is amazing! The characters are well described and the story moves at a nice pace. Suitable for reading on long drives or air trips. Pattinson makes thew reader Mark Steel. We share al his thoughts and adventures. It is also slightly humourus that every time Steel is ready to settle down, some terrible secret is revealed and he has to move on. Mark Steel himself is an interesting character. He appraoches each problem that comes his way with common sense and planning as he does when he destroys the drug operation of slimy millionare Wolf Masterson. ALll in all, an excellent he-man adventure!"
3,Not all original recordings here,"Be aware that the version of Making Our Dreams Come True sounds like it was transferred from a scratchy 45. Definitely not from the original master recording. The liner notes provide no explanation for this. The collection is a solid one otherwise, one of the best of the 25 volumes."
4,Great collection,"This is by far the best 70's collection available. The presentation and selection are organized and quite thorough. The songs are high quality and never are you short changed with an alternate version. The music is just the way you remember it, only better."
4,Good Nostalgia,"This CD is pretty good for your money's worth. It has that 'feel good nostalgia' sound, if you grew up in this era. The music is definately worth a listen to again, after all these years. This CD is a trip down memory lane and very refreshing. I enjoy replaying several tracks on it."
1,Please Shoot This CD,"First off there is one good song on this CD believe it or not, ""Right back Where We Started From"" and actually it sounds out of place with all the other crap that litters the remainder of this disc. These songs are best forgotten--they sucked when they came out and they suck now. If you must listen to them then attend a wedding reception."
4,Smaller than Expected,Ordered for my son fir xmas. It ended up being a lot smaller than expected but since you can't find the Power Ranger Dino Thunder in the stores anymore just glad I was able to get it for my son because he loves the Dino Thunder series.
5,Great buy for the money!,"Simple, easy to use and an excellent price. Sleek & good looking.I still havenot learned what all this player can do so it would be helpful to have a better user's manual."
1,garbage,This cable is garbage. It is built for show ONLY and has NO ability to do anything. It is a total scam.
2,A little disappointed with these mints.,"I bought these thinking they would be as good or better than Altoids or some of the leading sugarfree mints. They don't taste bad, but they are really tiny. If you put only one in your mouth you can barely feel it on your tongue and it is gone in about 30 seconds if you are careful not to bite it! I usually eat two or three at a time so these won't last me very long."
2,Eat Static - 'Crash And Burn' (Higher Octave),"This will likely be my first (and last) release I ever bother with by Eat Static - I often have heard their name mentioned only from Orric Tentacles fans. Personally, I didn't get much out of this (call it acid jazz or ambient dub) title. Only cut here I liked was the nine-minute inventive ""Holy War"" and TRIED to get into tunes like ""Nocturnal Umbra"" and ""Mondo A Go-Go"" but couldn't. Line-up (from what I could tell): Merv Pepler (Ozrics) - drums, Steve Joliffe & Joie Hinton - synthesizers and Steve Everitt - mixing. So, I gave it a shot."
2,Good but dated,"A range of music styles is mixed, flipped and tweaked by eat static with a sense of fun and energy but the result is now quite dated. It is one for the collection but the cheesy drum-rolls and cliched samples mean you won't play it often or out at a party. It lacks the production qualities and re-listenability of, say, Shpongle's Tales of the Inexpressive which executes similar musical ideas (eg meshing latin, breatbeat and trance) but with much more sophistication."
4,Organizer,I was very pleased with this purchase. It arrived very quickly (quicker than what they said) and in perfect condition!
1,On The Buses Move,"Bewarned these DVDs are extremely poor, bad quality.I purchased On The Buses Movies: On The Buses, Holiday on the buses, Mutany on the buses,They look as if they have been taken off very bad warn out home video tape recorded off TV. Some parts of the DVD were so bad I could not see what was happeningDONT WAST YOUR MONEY as I found them anoying to watch due to quality issuesSupplier did provide well packaged product on time, no isue with seller just the DVDs"
1,Don't be misled....,"This flute case is not what the product description would have you believe. The inside is just a flute case, with molds that are probably meant to fit a B flute, but which did not fit mine. The pouch is very small. You might be able to fit a metronome and tuner in it, if the metronome or tuner is the size of your palm. If you're looking for a pretty flute case, this might be what you need. If it's functionality you're after, you should probably keep looking."
3,ADVC300 REVIEW,DOES NOT LIVE UP TO MY STANDARDS. 1. DOES NOT IMPROVE FIREWIRE OUTPUT FROM YOUR CAMERA. 2 ONLY CONVERTS SVHS/AUDIO TO FIREWIRE OUTPUT WHERE YOU HAVE SOME CONTROL OF THE OUTPUT.
3,Manufacture is greedy,"This piece of equipment was better in it's previous form. The new one no longer comes with a power supply, you are supposed to get that from your firewire card. However if you are using a laptop, and I am, you would have to purchase an additional power supply from the manufacturer, at $35+ shipping and tax. To me this is completely unnaccaptable. They make no mention of it anywhere. They should give to people who ask for it for free. Heck at that point you have already shelled out $250 for this thing and then they try to stick it to you for additional money. Well I have opted not to, I'm going to get a PCMCIA card that supports 6 pin firewire and the crooks at CANOPUS can get money from some other sucker.I only gave it a 3 based on reviews of this product from friends, I hope it works as well as they have said it would."
2,No Software Support for Mac Lion,"I have used this amazing piece of hardware for some years. For a demanding hobby filmmaker, the ADVC 300 is still unmatched for any video digitalization or any video converting. However, the new owners of Canopus, Grass Valley, are happy to continue selling the product, but do not plan to update the Mac software of 2003 to the new Mac Lion. So, after installing Lion, I have no option but using the cumbersome and limited dip switches for setting anything, or to install a Windows solution on my Mac, or purchase a Windows PC to work properly my ADVC. Adequate connectors for the newer Macs are also not provided. So, if you are a Mac user, the ADVC 300 may not be the product you will be happy with. A pity."
3,Strong start and a weak ending. This is a book that could have been so much more.,"As with most golf books, this novel weaves a good amount of history into the story. That is probably the highlight of the book. The story itself started strong with a fledgling pro in jail being rescued by a caddie that could see the pro's true potential. There the story goes into fantasy mode. The caddie has too many contacts and it too mythical to make the novel really interesting or believable. The end of the story is lacking. The way in which the caddie disappears and the pro's quick progression through tournaments lacks detail and believablitity. Fantasy is good sometimes, just not here."
3,"Let's be real, nothing was better than the Greatest Player..","The Caddie is a nice story, and J. Michael Veron is a success story in his own right, but nothing is better than his first book, The Greatest Player Who Never Lived. That book kept you captivated from the first page to the last. It screamed movie, and from what I know, had bites from Hollywood, and if made correctly, has a chance to be the best golf movie ever made--why, because the book was more than golf--it was ""Grisham-like."""
5,I LOVE IT!,it makes you feel so sad! i'm only a freshman in high school but it made me think about what it'll be like when i have to leave the people i'm gonna spend 4 years with. u have to buy it if you haven't already!
1,WOOF!!!,"This song is now a fairly ""oldy,"" but it NOT all a goody. The only place for this song is in the Trash Compactor. This song is like half a decade old, and I think we should move on and forget about it! It's not a song that will ever stand the test of time. It is WAY over-rated and I can't stand to hear it. Everytime someone plays it I insist them to turn it off, I HATE this song. It is now dead to me, and when I came out whenever it was played around me, I either changed the channel or station or muted it. There is so much good ""real"" music out there. I am a real music fan and I have an appreciation for all sorts of music, but this one is just nothing but spoiled dog food!"
5,My Graduation Song!,"MY High School's senior advisors decided to use this Song ""Graduation, Friends Forever' As Our Graduation Song.1st time I heard it it made me cry, I feel just like the Girl in the video about Leaving High School! Sad, yet Excited that I will have no more School!In 3 more days I will Never walks the halls of my school again. :-(I ABSOULTELY LOVE THIS SONG! It's THE BEST!Iknow that most High Schools acroos the country are using this song right now for their Graduation.But I will never go to High School again and this song sums it up right here.....Friends Forever.Ya never forget your High School Friends!"
1,"LAME, HORRIBLE, TASTLESS, OVER-RATED SONG","Words can even describe this song, it just blows like heck!!! I'd like to build a bonfire on a beach, and invite everyone who curretly owns this CD and we can destroy it!! Barfing is probably one the only things I could when hearing this song. This song isn't a song that is going to ever last a lifetime. When this song first came out, it really drove me up a tree and I truely hated when it was new, and I don't see why anyone is still listening to it today. It's not a classic and is old, but not timeless. I don't understand why people listen to this piece of garbage when there is so much better and good music out there. This song is so bad, it makes Kenny G sound great, after hearing this rubbish. Don't waste your time and money on this song, there's so much good, timeless music. This is one the corniest songs and this is by far way OVER-RATED!!!"
5,My review,"Not many songs make me tear up. Now that I think about it, not many things in general make me tear up, but this song has done that. It has made me tear up. Everytime I hear the song, I think about my friends that are Juniors And Seniors, and that's what makes me cry. It also makes me think about my future and the day I graduate, which makes me tear up as well. This song is the best and I recommend it to anyone. BUY THIS CD!"
5,Good Song!,"I love this song! Infact, I got the words from LyricSearch.com and I am going to print that out, buy a CD single, and send it to my best friend that moved away! I would recommend this song to everyone, especially people who have friends that moved away!"
1,So much potential...,"Keep in mind that this is not Charlie Parker and Tito Puente together, but tracks of them seperately thrown onto the same disc.The music on this CD is incredible, but the quality of the recordings are not. The music sounds out-of-phase (where the music ""cancels"" itself out), leaving the listener with a sound that has a tremendous hole in the middle. I listened to this disc on a few different CD players, and the result was the same. Imagine this...being in a room with Charlie Parker, et al, and being able to only hear 5% of the music clearly, the rest an ""airy"" buzz. Only a few minutes of this disc was tolerable.It sounds as if this ""project"" was thrown together in order to make a quick buck, without giving any regard to quality. Do not waste your money."
1,Not worth the risk,"This product says its for nokias, yet when it is installed or the installation shows up it says motorola....So in the end it doesnt work, it didnt work, and I wont ever buy anything from this company again!Also when you post a bad review they send you an email asking you to remove it from the website...which I personally thought was very rude.The whole point of a reviewing process is to tell your likes and dislikes of the products.Over all bad company policies...bad product.If you want to waste your money...then buy this product."
3,"Good moisturizer, not sure about any long term effects.","This cream is good for hydrating skin quickly but unlike some other reviewers, I didn't notice any tingling or the immediate plumping action described. From the other reviews, I expected a tiny jar but it actually is a good sized jar, about the same as any other product. The good thing about this cream is that you only need a tiny bit. For the first 10 days I was able to get all the product I needed just from the lid."
5,Satisfied!,"Usually I'm happy when a product is ""good enough"". This cream goes far beyond that...it works miracles! Even after the first night, I could see a change for the better, and after two weeks, I would say it is a miracle-worker!Super-satisfied, will for sure buy again!"
5,Alba Very Emollient Lotion has kept psoriasis at bay for 5 years.,Five years ago my husband was seeing a dermatologist for a troublesome psoriasis condition on his torso and limbs and was undergoing UV light treatments (35 in all). Following each treatment the doctor's office recommended and provided Alba Very Embollient Lotion. I began buying it by the gallon through Amazon and he has used it daily ever since. His doctor expected to see him back within six months subsequent to the UV treatments however the psoriasis did not reoccur and treatments have not been necessary.
5,Lightweight Body Lotion,"If you are looking for a lightweight body lotion with natural ingredients, this is a good choice. It is completely unscented and has wonderful soothing ingredients like aloe vera and cucumber extract. Also contains lavender, chamomile, avocado, sea kelp, vitamins and green tea.Recommended for sensitive skin and can be used over the entire body. I like using this as a hand lotion and keep it by my sink. It is lightweight enough so that it absorbs completely without a greasy feel and moisturizing enough that it sooths my hands after washing them.No animal testing100% Vegetarian Ingredients~The Rebecca Review"
3,Good Price..'Sour' Odor,This is a product that I usually buy in smaller amounts at the store. Buying online in this gallon size was a good buy. Just wish it would have come with a pump and that it didn't have a sort of 'sour odor' that I haven't noticed from this product from my in-store purchases.
1,Order fulfilled wrongly,I ordered and paid for 128oz. size and was sent a 64oz size instead. I have called and tried to get this rectified and no one has responded to this mistake. I would never order from this company again! I purchased this item through Amazon from a company called America RX.
5,Love this!!,I love this lotion. I bought the gallon so that everyone in the house can use it. I use it on my babies as well as my self. I have started to use this in place of face moisturizer.
3,Give It A H.A.N.D.,"Containing a few big late-70s hits like ""My Sharona"" and ""Gold"" plus some decent 70s shlock, it's one of the best volumes in the Have A Nice Day series."
4,"Disco, Ballads, Rockers...Take Your Pick!","Volume 22 in this ""Have A Nice Day"" CD series covers the major hits from the Fall of '78 on through to the fall of '79. There's something for every fan of late '70's music here. You have Disco (Every 1's a Winner-Hot Chocolate), Ballads (Lotta Love-Nicolette Larson, Dancin' Shoes-Nigel Olsson, Stumblin' In-Chris Norman and Suzi Quatro, Love Is In The Air-John Paul Young, Sad Eyes-Robert John and You Take My Breath Away-Rex Smith) as well as some good rockers (Hot Child In The City-Nick Gilder, Gold-John Stewart, Driver's Seat-Sniff 'N The Tears). The only bad song in this collection is Ian Gomm's ""Hold On"", otherwise, the many above listed songs make this d a must buy!"
3,Waring Pro DF250,"A little disappointed in this product. The basket is a little shallow. Also, I checked the oil temperature with an analog and digital thermometer and it only heats up to 325F. Its off by 50 degrees at its highest setting and is slow to recover when food is inserted."
1,Don't waist your money,"Damn it made good frys, for about a week.I was pleased and happy with this fryer. Seemed to work fine. I cleaned and stored it. The next time I tried to use it it was dead. I cleaned all the connections and tried repetedly to make it work. Nothing.This item will work once. Then you put it up for a couple of months.It will not work again. Well, maybe yours will, but don't invest money that you may lose.Did I just find a bad one?"
1,BUY A COMMERCIAL UNIT--NOT THIS ONE,"I have to wonder if the people who like this unit have a clue.What is the most important characteristic of a fryer?TEMPERATURE!! If you cannot get at least 360 deg.f, then the unit is useless. This unit claims to go to 375 deg.fI measured the max temp of my unit (canola oil) with 2 known to be accurate thermometers.The result?Max temp is only 320 deg.fComplained to Waring who sent me a new heating unit. Installed same abd ran the same test with the same result--max temp is still only 320 deg.fThrew it away and bought a commercial Cecilware 6 pound countertop 120 volt fryer for $330. Works like a charm and can go to 375 deg.f, no problem.So save your money and go to the nearest restaurant supply house and get something that you can actually fry in."
3,Not As Good As His Later Books,"This book was written in 1986. Although it is decent, it is probably the only Dave Barry book in my collection that I don't re-read occasionally. The jokes just seemed a bit staged as compared to his later writing, because the book doesn't reference any true life stories. If that's what you prefer, then this book will suit you fine, but I prefer the ""I'm-Not-Making-This-Up"" stories of actual events that are his trademark.If you are looking for a humor book on the topic of corporate America, then this is a good choice. However, if you just want to read some funny Dave Barry, then try one of his later books, such as one of his compilations of short articles."
2,allright,"i bought this magic sing as a christmas present for my wife. we like it, but it could have been better. i wonder if paying the extra $100 for the next step up would have made the difference. the songs were kind of old and since were hispanics, we purchased a chip with spanish songs, which made it easier for us. the product itself is allright, but the sound that comes out of it it's kind of echo sound and that makes it not too appealing for us. we've only played it twice and are waiting until we go out foe a trip with family to take it with us and then well know what others have to say about it."
3,not a lot,Songs aren't popular..hope next time they should the titles of the songs in addition to the singers..I still gave it a 3 star eventhough I just used it once.
1,Guinea Pigs and the Popcorn Sticks,I purchased 3 packages of this product and our two little pigs sniffed it and then never touched it again! I would not recommend this product.
5,Small Towns& Big Dreams-Paul Brandt,"As always anything by Paul Brandt is fantastic..can't figure out the music market here in the states not recognizing such a fine versatile artist..boy are they missing the bet.. Thanks for giving Pauls fans a chance to own his works..Billye J. Obray Colorado Springs,CO (PS I'm way over 13 yrs old)"
4,Well selected anthology of Dave's group and solo work,"Dave Edmonds is an enigma. From Love Sculpture to Rockpile he has focused on capturing elements of the bands and producers he listened to as a child. What's hard to figure out is Dave's appeal. He's not a great vocalist, but he has passion. He's not a great guitar player, but invests every note with meaning. He's not a great song writer, but every song counts. All of this adds up to his unique personna and perspective as producer/performer.When I say he isn't great at any of the above skills it's not meant as a slap. Indeed, it is the fact that he doesn't command those skills that makes him so unusual. It's as if, recognizing his shortcomings, he pulls it altogether. Give me a Dave Edmonds outtake any day of the week over the drivel produced by the Stones (at least since Sticky Fingers). Dave's committment commands respect and the sum of his talent is worth more than the parts."
1,Easily broken,"The hand crank on the tripod broke the first time I used it. Called Tiffen to get a replacement since they have a ten year warranty on their product. They said they would send out the replacement part, but after longer then a month I haven't received anything, which I'm sure will be the case until I throw the piece of c... out!!! Also, the camera moves on the tripod when the shutter is pushed. This seems odd since the use of a tripod is supposed to prevent this from happening. Dissatisfied customer. Don't buy if you expect to have the item repaired if it breaks within the warranty period, a laugh out loud ten years, or if your serious about quality. Better make that warranty ten minutes gentlemen!!"
2,Better tripods are out there for less.,Radio Shack has a better one for $10. This one fully extended likes to wobble.
1,Cheap Tripod,"This tripod feels like it is very cheaply made. I dont care for the mount on it either. Yes it was very cheap, but for a few dollars more I have seen some much better products."
2,"Light yes, but can't hold camera","The only positive thing I can say about this tripod is that it is very light and very cheap. I tried to use it several times - does it's job only if the camera is positioned right on top (90 degrees). If you move the camera and change the angle the top stand twists and fall back under the camera weight. I was using canon powershot S3 IS, which is really light. I can't imagine if you use it with a dslr camera. My final conclusion - It is good if you don't need to change the vertical position of the camera."
1,Cheap and flimsy,"I bought this tripod as means to use with my Canon Rebel with 75-300mm lens. Literally the moment I clicked it into position on the tripod, the plastic shoe snapped off and my camera headed toward the floor. Thankfully I grabbed it before it did any damage to my camera. This tripod should be fine for any point and shoot camera but it is very bad idea for any nice SLR camera, especially with a long lens."
2,Loved it till it broke,"I LOVED this tripod right when I got it. It's lightweight, comes with a case and a level and was pretty stable. Then one day while i was tightening one of the screws it stripped the plastic and now won't tighten anymore. I could deal with it because it was one i didn't tighten often. But then today, the main long handle that you use to change the angle of the camera stripped too!! I don't tighten it really tight, but i tighten it pretty often because i change the angle I shoot at a lot. This is an important screw. To just strip so easily... I was really disappointed. I'm going to send my tripod back with the ten year warranty and see what happens.I'm not sure if other people have had this problem or if it's just my use. Besides this incident, the tripod has been wonderful."
5,Great!,"This tripod has been invaluable to me as I'm starting up a business that requires me to take good detailed photos of my product.Great purchase, I highly recommend it!"
2,Only lasted one use,I got all excited since this was a very inexpensive tripod and the reviews were good. Got the item and the first time I used it for Christmas eve photosthe lever that releases the pan and tilt head broke off. Other than that this is a good starter tripod.
4,Good low price,For a basic tripod you can't beat this one for the price. The footprint is rather large so make sure you aren't in a crowded area.
5,good for the price,a bit short but what do you expect for $15 bucks its just an averae trypod that folds down really small and love the carrying bag makes it a lot easier for me
3,Flimsy but cheap,"This tripod is too short (I virtually always use it extended to full height, including the head), too flimsy (it struggles to hold my Canon 400D still, even with a small lens), and difficult to adjust (the same camera is virtually impossible to hold at much of an angle). The removable head is also a bit flimsy. However, it's also light, and ridiculously cheap. Don't pay more than $15 for it, and you won't be disappointed."
1,"Useful if your last name is ""Cleaver""","There is a simple test to determine whether your level of sexual maturity and experience surpasses the level to which this book is addressed...Do you giggle nervously and blush whenever you hear the word &quot.....""? If you've made it past that stage, then you're ahead of this book. Naive, uninspired, unsophisticated, shallow, brainless and silly are all words that come to mind. Ozzie and Harriet would have found it ""naughty"", but Mike and Carol Brady would have probably fallen asleep before chapter two."
2,What a rip off,"This book is not only extrememly overpriced, but it is also poorly written, full of typos, and the graphs, charts, pictures etc. aren't very useful or relevant. Unfortunately, it was a required textbook for a college course I took a couple of semesters ago. I strongly advised the instructor to find a different text that was better written and lower priced."
3,Almost complete,"This is a good primer on management, but don't think that by attending a class with this book that you are prepared to attack the business community and win. This is one of many books published by McGraw-Hill that cover business, and I find them all a little more difficult to put things together than other books on these subjects. Since these are text books and not how to manuals they are about right if you have a teacher that has actually been in business."
1,DVD DOES NOT PLAY ON MY COMPUTER,I've never seen this movie and I guess I won't for a while because the DVD will not play on my computer. I do not own a tv. so beware anyone who wishes to buy this DVD and hopes to play it on their computer. :(
2,How rated so high,"I have used numerous epoxies. This one hasn't dried 4 days later , plus there are wrinkles all over the top. It was smooth 2 days ago. Would never again buy or refer this epoxy to anyone. Very disappointed. Now I have to sand smooth and put a better brand down"
4,The Down Side Of Having Money,"Well I must say, I'm happy to see someone is willing to show the down side of having so much money. If you go by all the videos and entertainers of today, you would think that having money is the answer to all problems. If you think thats true, you gotta read this book and see the light. Grace didn't know how rich she was without the millions. The way she started to change was so sad, and Janet, that no good tramp. She should have been in the car with Mason at the end. I think the reason I couldn't put this book down wasn't because it was the best book I ever read. It's that the writer made me want to see Janet and Mason get their's. I would recommend this book."
3,"Sweet story, sweet town, sweet people...a bit too sweet.",First of all let me say that I DID like this story. It was a charming love story. My only complaint is that I found it too sweet. Everyone had a strong Christian faith and that's all they seemed to talk about. Not that that's a bad thing but I just don't find it very realistic. I will continue reading the series because I did enjoy it. It had a bit of humor too which I like. I just didn't think it was fantastic.
1,Not the right case,This camera case is almost the size of a laptop computer case. It is too large for this tiny digital camera and has slots to hold rolls of film which of course you don't use with a digital camera. I believe this is a mismarked item!
2,Completely broken upon delivery!,I am not happy that this was completely broken in the package when I opened the box. It was all in crumbs. I should not even be charged for this.
3,Good but not groundbreaking guide to rubrics,"This book provides a useful overview of rubrics and offers numerous examples of different types and styles of rubrics. Stevens and Levi write in a clear and straightforward style that busy educators will appreciate. Regretfully, the authors of the book base many of their claims about the utility of rubrics (in particular, the idea that rubrics save time and that students should be involved in rubric instruction) on their own experience without referencing any other already-existing education research as support. Even so, this book still will be helpful for college-level instructors looking systematically incorporate rubrics into their classes."
5,Concise and timely,Excellent reference for the evolving instructor in college courses. Works great for online courses as well. Will be applying my new information on a regular bases.Excellent read!
5,Top-notch scholarship,"I absolutely love this book. The contributors to this book are highly intelligent and thoughtful human beings, as is the editor. I would recommend it to, well, anyone...feminist women, (pro)feminist men, ANY men, intellectuals, and so forth. I particularly like the chapters by Kimmel (well, I like ANYTHING written by him), Hopkins, and Pronger. A truly amazing read."
3,Gregorian Strategy for Multiple Deck Blackjack,"I read the book slowly and carefully as the author suggested. I had a hard time getting past the condescending remarks toward the reader. But, I also understand not all professional blackjack players are professional writters.I would have liked more technical inforamation and sample hands to further emphasize the differences from the standard ""old"" blackjack plays.Also, I noted several typos on the chart (see page 74). I made the corrections based on the text and created my own chart that is color coded. I shrank the entire chart down to a 3"" x 5"" size and laminated it at a local copy store. Total cost was $4.06.I have been practicing the Gregorian Strategy at home with basic card counting and have been successful at the casino.Overall, I am glad the author has made this strategy available. I plan to use it and apply it ever time I play multiple decks. I'm sure it will make me a more successful blackjack player in a very short period of time."
5,Best blackjack book on the market bar none!,"Well Greg, looks like another knucklehead wrote a bad review on your book without even trying it. Oh well. Greg, if you are reading this I want to thank you for writing/creating such a powerful system. I am doing very well with your strategy! Thanks again. Ken from Las Vegas."
2,Not so revolutionary!,"I thought I had found a very interesting book on Blackjack. I was wrong. If you truly want to spend some time reading a good and helpful book on BJ well just do not buy this book. I went through the book in few hours and I have to say that I was not impress at all. The author is not very convincing at all. It takes a while before he gets to the point in the chapter the gregorian theorem. No evidence other than the words from the author that this strategy works! What a good way to convince me. Though, if you have enough spare time I would say to you to test that strategy and verify by yourself its validity. If you have the time of course..."
4,Sceptic turned believer.,"Heard a lot about this book so I bought it.Read it thru thought is was mostly BS.Tried strategy at home with suprising results.Played in the casino again with suprising results.To date in over 6 months of regular weekend play, I am up using this strategy.After using this strategy I will not go back to old basic."
2,The Jury is out,"I had already been playing an altered version of basic strategy for some time when I bought this book. Beleive me, when you play using this strategy in a casino where other seasoned players are sitting, you'll get some strange looks, and even growls.I agree with much of his strategy, however, I can't agree with some things he preaches. I use a progressive betting system, and they do work!! He does provide some good information for those of us now looking for that 1 thing to better our strategy, even though I don't buy into all of it, my winning rate has improved slightly. Worth reading, but don't take any more than you can handle seriously."

5,The End of Casino Blackjack,I would get in now while the gettin's good! I don't give casino blackjack much more than about 10 years more existence in it's present form due to the info in THIS book. I'm not quitting my dayjob but I am going part-time. Hard to believe this game has been played incorrectly in this country for over 100 years. See you in Vegas.
5,"The 'HOLY GRAIL"" of blackjack books!","This is the book that blackjack players/gamblers have always waited for! The NEW strategy for blackjack which is in this book is everything the author says it is and more! The author claims that this new strategy will ""revolutionize"" the game, and I have no doubt that is certainly will. I have played using this strategy in Atlantic City and at $50.00 a hand I won over $2,500 in less than 10 hours! NO COUNTING! Simply by playing using this ""Gregorian Strategy."" I have been playing blackjack for over 5 years with the old basic strategy/card counting using the high/low and I never had ""luck"" like I have had since I have used this new strategy. In my opinion after reading this book and applying this new ""revolutionary"" strategy, this is the future of casino blackjack."
4,Over all a winning strategy.,"Over the past month I have been analyzing this new strategy in depth in real time using a six deck shoe 70%pennetration with Las Vegas strip rules. After five thousand hands, played out just as the writer states in the book, my win rate is .6 percent. This is lower than the author claims, but suprisingly enough I am showing an overall win. However, there is a question with the play recommended with the 2 in two instances. In the text it says to stand with soft 18 against the 2, on the strategy chart it says hit, (some confusion here), for my play I stood on soft 18 as it stetes in the text. Also, the author says to hit hard 15 against the 2, in my analysis, it may be better to stand although hitting the hard 14 seems to work as the author states. All things considered, and although at this point, (at 5000 hands), I am below the suggested win rate of the writer, I am winning at just over 1/2 of one percent. Overall, this strategy seems to me to work."
5,This is the book for you.,"Simply the most original, easiest to learn and effective new strategy for blackjack. I am a semi-professional blackjack player having played all over the world for many years.I began using this gregorian strategy in January and since that time I have won an average of 6 of 10 sessions putting me ahead several thousand dollars.I have had the opportunity to talk and learn from the author through the books web site. Mr Mannarino in my opinion is the authority on modern casino games and I would like to thank him here publically for all his help."
3,Doesn't Sink Like A Rock But Doesn't Swim Either,"Sgt. Rock: Between Hell and a Hard Place is a passable graphic novel authored by Brian Azzarello and drawn by Joe Kubert.Azzarello's writing is solid but doesn't give enough historical flavor. Garth Ennis' Enemy Ace: War In Heaven plunges the reader into the Second World War with memorable characters, fascinating facts and actual events. Azzarello's writing captures the cadence and lingo of the War but doesn't go far enough.The plot here is interesting but ends disappointingly.Joe Kubert's art is very good but not his best work. Joe is around 70 years old so I'm sure age has affected his art somewhat. His work is still pretty great but I'm spoiled by the classic Joe Kubert art.This book will satisfy hardcore fans but let down casual buyers."
4,Don't listen to that other guy,"Simply put, if you love the art form and are a fan of movies like Kelly's Heroes, The Dirty Dozen, and especially recent outings like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, this is for you.The art is great, as should be expected from a true master such as Kubert. Comparing this to his previous work on the characters (back in the 70's), you can see how much he has grown as an artist. It's classic Kubert through and through.Give it a shot, especially at the price they're offering here."
4,Great for everyday,"Perfect glasses for everyday use in a busy household with children. I even dropped one glass and it didn't break. I received multiple broken glasses with first shipment and amazon immediately shipped me a new box. My only complaint is that the bottom is slightly indented, and so holds water after going into the dishwasher upside down."
4,Good for everyday use,"This is good for everyday use. Not really a fancy/intricate/artsy design, more blockish, but the glass is a little thicker than most, which is good. The small glasses are 12 oz (larger than most small glassware), and the large ones are 16 oz. This is more of a ""guys"" kind of set/design, more plain, rather than one a woman might use for fancy entertaining dinnerware, but could probably do the job."
1,Pass,"I actually got a copy of this game while doing some game-testing at Acclaim. (The game was another horrible supercross game, by the way.) Both my and my 2 friends who went with me sold the game after a matter of days. It's absolutely horrible! There's no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Now, I'm not a supercross enthusiast, but I do appreciate good games. This is not a good game. If you must try it, rent it, don't waste your money."
4,"Good gate, especially for difficult stairways.","Good gate, especially for difficult stairways. This was the 5th gate we tried for our landing, and the first that actually worked out!"
4,Great gate!,"This gate is sturdy feeling once it is set up, is easy to put together, and opens in both directions. There is one problem with the gate which is easily fixed. This gate, like many others, has an approximately one inch bar across the bottom of the opening of the gate which you must step over whenever you go through the gate. This is a trip hazard, and the fix is a small plastic ramp that attaches to the bar. If you are using the gate to go in both directions, you have to order two of them, one for each side. I ordered one, expecting it to be two sided, but the company doesn't sell it that way. Also, I have found no easy way of ordering this extremely important ""extra"" other than calling the company (KidCo) directly."
2,Very flimsy & hard to assemble - not really safe,"We bought this to keep our dog in the kitchen and our son out - it was terribly difficult to install, even for my husband, who is very handy - the attachment holes on the extensions do not line up and the directions are not really directions, but just a few confusing diagrams. When it's installed across a wide opening (such as the opening between our family room and kitchen), it's very wobbly and flimsy. Also, the latch on the gate section is awkward and a child (or even a smart dog) could easily figure out how to bypass this gate. Only good thing about it is that it looks nice, but other than that, definitely would not recommend buying it."
3,A bit wobbly.,"The gate did fit the large opening to our living room. However, it is a bit wobbly and shakes pretty wildly when our one year old hangs on it."
1,Too small for Credit Cards,"I have been an eel skin wallet user for 20 plus years. As mine was showing its age, I purchased this item.It arrived in a timely manner, looked well built... if you have miniature credit cards, drivers licenses etc.The wallet is so constrained in size that business cards would buckle when attempting to put them in.This is the first thing I ever threw away that I purchased on Amazon.com"
3,WRONG COLOR!,"I ordered this product in Tan color, but a black one was delivered to me. It was interesting that even the invoice inside the packaging indicated that the color was tan. Since I really need to use one now and the quality is acceptable, I'll just keep it. I hope the company will not make a mistake in delivering an incorrect item again."
4,Compact and a great value,"I have searched high and wide for a compact wallet that doesn't overwhelm my pocket. It seems like most wallet manufacturers get their design cues from women who carry a pocketbook. This item is compact in size and thickness. It is well made and lives up to it's billing. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because eelskin is not as durable as cowhide, but at this price, you can buy another one after a year or two."
5,Great Dicitionary,This dictionary has got you covered. I've been carrying this for years now. It is a great pocket dictionary! If you are looking for something to aid your studying though I would look else where. It does not have example sentences and the vocab can be limited. If you are looking for a dictionary to aid you in your travels or day to day life in a Chinese speaking country. This is fei chang hao :)
5,excellent,"a perfect little dictionary. yes it might be missing a few words, but it is far and away a wonderfully accessible dictionary that is ideal for everyday use. easy to use and well laid out."
3,Yes & No,Yes-the product came very fast.No-not too satisfied...this is not really for a two-way look-up since it does not provide English pronunciation and seems only designed for Madarin-Learners/Beginners. A bit out of expectation. Does not really give me much apperti' to use as much as I was looking forward to having one.
2,Unbalanced Collection Delivers Little,"Some big hits shine on this CD, but the balance is thrown off by some real duds: ""I Don't Want to Love You But You Got Me Anyway"" by the Sutherland Brothers & Quiver is a non-hit, and who can say that they know anything about ""Rendezvous"" by the Hudson Brothers? Worst of all, an edited version of the rock classic ""Love Hurts"" by Nazareth is included. An odd assortment that could have used some careful revision. All originals."
3,super hits,The cd arrived in good condition. The music was not what I expected to be. Overall it was a mistake on my part.
2,VAST WASTELAND,"""Goodtime Charlies Got the Blues"", is the only cut that redeems this otherwise mundane collection of 70s pop. Theme from THE ROCKFORD FILES? Thou could never understand why a couple people here and there liked that screeching, miserable ode to TV themes. I was there, and I never even heard of some of these trashy excuses for the decade of hedonism. It's an embarassment."
3,OK but an odd assortment!,"Not bad but a little uneven, some nice songs like Dancing in the Moonlight, and Smokin in the Boys Room but some of the songs just sound out of place like they just don't belong here, like Feelings, etc!"
3,Mixed Bag,"Volume 17 of Super Hits of the 70's contains some of the best and the worst of what the 70's had to offer. ""Dancing In The Moonlight"" by King Harvest is an all-time classic with it's shuffling keyboard riff and sing along chorus. ""Dance With Me"" is a nice ballad from Orleans, ""Love Hurts"" by Nazereth is one of the original power ballads and packs a punch, Mike Post's ""Rockford Files Theme"" is one of the better TV theme songs and Brownsville Station's ""Smokin' In The Boy's Room"" is trashy fun. On the other side ""Feelings"" by Morris Albert is one of the most insipid pieces of schmaltz ever recorded. It is a song that many people point to for giving 70's music a bad name. ""Good Time Charlie's Got The Blues"" by Danny O'Keefe and Freddie Fender's pseudo tex-mex ""Before The Next Teardrop Falls"" are both equally awful."
4,4 stars because,"Hey!!!, everybody on these reviews are overlooking the Smash hit by Ian Thomas ""Painted Laidies"", if you haven't heard of this song then god help you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I'm one of the biggest Gravenities fans ever--his work with Electric Flag is legendary. But this album, despite the all-star sidemen, is a bust, from the songwriting to the performance to the simply awful cover to the styling. I was expecting blues, but what I got was anything but. Nick is so very, very talented. I do hope he gets another chance in a stripped-down setting to show just how skilled a performer and songwriter he is."
5,Fantastic Year of Music,These hits are Just Terriffic It Was just Like turning 21 again in 77 highly Recomendable Music
5,May be the best of the mid-70s volumes,"Volume 19 of the ""Have a Nice Day"" series has a decidedly gentle sound to it, concentrating on ballads like Mary MacGregor's ""Torn Between Two Lovers"" and David Soul's maudlin ""Don't Give Up On Us, Baby"" to more middle-of-the-road but still melodic cuts like Orlean's ""Still the One"" and 10cc's excellent ""The Things We Do for Love."" The disc also includes the near-instrumental ""Gonna Fly Now"", theme from the decade's most prolific sequel producing movie, Rocky.There isn't much profound thought or social commentary in these songs, just a lot of good music and fond memories. This one's a keeper."
4,music lover,"A lot of excellent titles and all by the original artist, most of which are seldomly played on the radio today. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because the sound quality is not as good as most other cassettes are."
1,looks funny,"how can there be a review, when I don't have anything to review.........I don't have the movie yet, hate is such a strong word....more like not pleased !"
1,Mackem accent,I speak several languages and have an ear for subtle dialect differences.I must concur with A K A Me. In my opinion what is obviously a very enjoyable concept is undermined by the strong Mackem accent which makes it near impossible to understand Sean Landless who plays Jimmy Spud. Having to listen intensely to the dialogue detracts from the cinematic experience. It would would be nice to have subtitles added.
2,Not a hit,"Our children love Animal Planet, but we don't like the commercials on television. We thought this would be a good alternative; however, the style of these shows are so rapid, bouncing from one clip to the next that the children don't really get an in-depth idea about the animals. These are too cutesy and the narration is odd. If your children are really into animals these may seem a bit limited for their appreciation. For what it's worth, our oldest is 3 & 1/2 and she loves to watch the real animal shows. We were looking for an alternative that would provide her quality information about animals without the commercials. Unfortunately what we've ended-up with is an oddly watered down ""kids"" video about animals. Our son, 18 months, seems to like the ""dance"" portion of each video, though."
3,A children's animal collection,I am 66 this collection is directed toward children. I don't like the music.
4,Good Kids movies,My two year old loves these movies. The best movie is the Swinging Safari. The other three aren't as good. One good thing about them is they have extra movies in the special features that are really good. They are about as long as the actual movie. I recommend them to all parents who have kids that like animals.
2,"Disappointing - Little content, lots of flashing images","We expected more from NG. These videos were mostly just quick clips of various creatures, 5 seconds for most, and very little informational content. Good to plop the kids in front of if you want to distract them, not good at all for learning."
2,Not exactly what I was anticipating...,"This DVD set was disappointing in it's presentation and delivery; especially the dino video, and my son was looking forward to that one most. The ""filler"" silly humor is a waste of film space - I think I'd rather purchase an adult version of a National Geographic documentary. Flashing disjointed scenes of various dinosaurs to some kind of rap I suppose the producers deemed kid-friendly was not appealing to my 6 yr. old at all. He kept asking when the show was actually going to start. Overall, it's not a ""bad"" set...it's just not worth the money. Turn on the Discovery Channel instead."
5,Plug up and make the world go away,"These plugs are as effective as any I've ever used, and they wear well, keeping their shape and elasticity through many, many insertions. Plus, the price is definitely right."
5,"If you ride over 45 mph, you need these","Just order some. For ~$4 these are a great deal. I have tried many different ear plugs and these are by far the most comfortable to wear for long rides at speed. The ride is so much more comfortable too. Buy them, try them out. All you have to lose is $4. Trust me though, you'll keep a set in your jacket pocket once you realize how nice they are."
3,A lifetime supply,"14 pairs? I bought a package of these great noise reducing ear plugs, and placed 4 pair in three zip lock bags to share with family as stocking stuffers, leaving 2 pairs for myself. Combined with an eye mask, I find them essential for getting 40 winks en route from San Francisco to London, Paris or Frankfurt. Don't leave home without them."
2,Not Really All that Great,"I guess you get what you pay for, I bought these because I have noisy upstairs neighbors, but these are not really that effective in keeping the noise out. These earplugs only muffle the noise."
3,Not the Newer Softer Version,"The ear plugs are pretty good, but they were not the new ""Now Softer"" version specified in the listing and shown in the picture. I had a free sample pair and they were softer. Hopefully, they will use up the old stock before I need to order again."
2,Should be labeled extra large!,"These things are huge. Every time I tried to use them, they'd work their way right out, no matter how much I squished them. I finally started cutting them in half the long way and then folding them over. That works pretty well, at least makes them usable. I bought them because they were a good price. The orange ones I've bought in the past didn't work their way out of my ears, so I'll probably buy those next time.Now I understand why another reviewer complained about these coming out of their ears. I thought maybe they just didn't know how to use them properly. Now I know--they're BIG!"
5,Work Great !,"I Have ordered before and use them for getting sleep in a noisy house hold in the mid-dat, and they work great for sleeping"
1,Caused Tinnitus,"I now have severe inner ear damage thanks to these earplugs. I would caution anybody using earplugs to sleep to be careful. I usually sleep on my right side, so I believe these earplugs were pushing up against my right ear and caused some inner ear damage. Now, I get this constant ringing in my ear which my doctor diagnosed as tinnitus and there's no cure for this condition. :(So please, take care of your ears and be aware when using these earplugs!"
1,Might as well but cotton in your ears...doesn't work,They don't stay in my ears and as I'm typing this with them barely in my ears I can hear myself typing on my MacBook Pro.... I was hoping to block out noise completely.....this product does not do that.
2,Not Very Good,"I order a lot of things from Amazon, and this is one of the few items that really disappointed me. The earplugs simply did not muffle sound nearly to the extent that I had hoped. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I cannot recommend them."
2,Do not keep sound out!,"Yes,I have tried Heaors Ear plugs and not only do they not work but I can still hear a sound I was trying to keep out completelY.I have asked for a refund,so cheap to,and do not stay in your ear long!"
5,Really Enjoyable!,"Ann Margaret is not only beautiful, but also sweet and talented. Her talent shines in this Hallmark Hall of Fame movie, ""A Place Called Home."" Of the many enjoyable, well done, family oriented Hallmark movies I've watched, ""A Place Called Home"" ranks as one of the best. The movie is about a lady, Tula Jeeters (Ann Margaret) who is losing her sight, yet as the movie progresses sees ever more clearly. A greedy niece and nephew will go to any lengths to force Tula out of her beautiful lake front home, so they can develop the property. Tula takes in a father and daughter, Hank and Cali Ford (drifters) to help her out. Several years after the death of her beloved husband, Tula also finds a new love. The social worker, Jan Kyles who is sent by Tula's greedy relatives to determine her competency to live on her own supports Tula and also finds herself attracted to the drifter Hank. This was definitely a five star movie."
3,Maybe too simple,"I bought this DVD for the sole purpose of seeing Hunter Tylo. I had hoped that this movie was filmed before she had all that massive cosmetic surgery, for she was a real beauty before all that, but unfortunately not. Also, her acting was not much better than what it is on The Bold and the Beautiful. She seemed uncomfortable in the role, as if thinking, ""I can't believe I'm doing this,"" in some scenes. Maybe she just was not a good pick for the role.As to the movie itself, the story line is good, but it left me a bit untouched. I thought the flow was awkward in some places, as were some of the other actors. But it is a good, clean movie, with a sweet plot. I would recommend this movie to those who are looking for just that."
3,Clean and beautifully filmed but utterly transparent,"I found myself wanting badly to love this film but could never quite get over the glaring issues in the screen play to make the transition from nice film to great film. The problem is that the characters and plot are tranparently obvious from the film's first momments. There are no significant plot twists, no surprises, and it was far too afterschoolly in feel to consider it real entertainment. The type of film you might show at a church social. Nothing that would offend and all the loose ends tied up nicely by the end. Just a little too sacrine and too far removed for reality for my tastes.I found the plot to be second rate compared to such films as the Secret of the Cave, or A Perfect Stranger."
3,low scale,"This product is a little hard to use compared to the torch I previously owned. It is hard to adjust and some of the ""buttons"" do not seem to have a purpose. If they do, it is not spelled out in the instructions. Which leads me to my main complaint... the instructions are at best pathetic. It does not have much gumption and I bought it to torch peppers. Seems to take longer than my old one whose switch went out."
1,quit working,"don't know if mine was defective, but not a very good design even if it worked - you have to dial the gas on, light, and dial the gas all the way off to shut it down. then, it quit working after about 10 uses."
5,"""chilling""",Love this Album!!! Every Song on this album has a different and unique sound of it's own. Really like the country/blues mix. Very HIGH spirts and uplifting. The artist seems to really appreciate his music and has a want to move on in the music industry. I wish him the best of luck and looking forward to a new release.
4,Co-Occurring or Dual Disorders,"There are too few books that are broken down into simple, and helpful, formats. With thousands of people recovering from addictions and mental health issues, having a practical, down-to-earth daily guide brings a lot of relief. When attention spans are short from either depression, ADD, anxiety, or any other distracting life event, this book can speak clearly and yet very helpfully."
5,Among the best albums you've never heard,"I would hardly ever give anything five stars, but considering the number of times I've listened to this album (I got a speeding ticket because of it! Isn't that high praise?) I think it deserves such a rating. Moa's voice is not for everybody- many have and will find it annoyingly nasal. I love it, but then, I'm a fan of odd and unusual voices. Her music is a bit like Bjork in spirit, but in no other respect. It's truly a kind of electronic torch-song jazz (with touches of disco and pop). She's got more wit and verve than the rest of the dreamy electronic crowd (Morcheeba, Portishead, etc.). ""Universal"" is great pop; why it's not on the radio is a mystery to me. Those reviewers who have found it repetitious need to spend more time listening to what pop radio does play!"
4,Móa - Universal,"What is it with Iceland and its vocalists? Móa moves more towards the jazz and pop than countrywomen Bjork, but her voice is just as distinctive. ""Joy & Pain"" has a great bassline to offset her high-pitched voice, and she handles the quick paces of ""Toy"" like a champ. She sounds better, though, when the production is lush and she has something to work off of; the more spare ""Memory Cloud"" doesn't have the same oomph. But the upbeat energy of ""Can't Forget You"" showcase her voice excellently, as does the low growl of ""Tenderly."" The electro-house of ""Raining in My Heart"" has a nice, romantic quality to it (the remix goes slightly deeper into the disco), though ""Virtual Affair"" tries for sexy and doesn't quite hit it. Good, perky fun!"
2,Warning!,"Be advised, for those of you who may have never heard Moa before, that this Icelandic lady has an extremely annoying voice...so annoying that this CD almost sounds comical, like a bad joke. The only ear-opener is track 3: ""Memory Cloud"", a smooth dance groove. But be warned: HER VOICE. The stuff nightmares are made of."
1,There's a reason you haven't heard of this.............,"This cd is bad bad bad. Moa doesn't sound like any of the much better groups that some reviewers have compared her to. Bad voice, bad song writing, bad melodies. Just because she won the annual Miss Iceland Uma Thurman look alike contest doesn't mean she can or should sing.... we get enough of that here in The States on commercial radio. Let the price of her used cd's be your guide... 57 cents?"
4,Great buy (used to be),"Very good quality, looks better than the picture, snaplink is sturdy and heavy, beautiful leather (I got a tan one).Update 2012: just received a new one to replace my old broken snaplink key chain. The designer removed the second (pigskin) layer, so leather feels thinner and somewhat cheaper. According to the seller, it was done to show ""the proper underside of the leather""."
2,"SLOW STARTER, BUT DECENT SECOND HALF! 2 1/2 STARS!","'Death Valley' is a little frustrating at first becasue we all know what this film is about, but the makers of this film want to bore us to death before getting on with the show! Once it gets there it's a pretty good survial horror tale with some fairly realistic reactions. The cast is pretty good for this type of stuff, but the slow first half really takes this one down a notch. I've seen worse, but I've seen a lot better too. It's worth a look on cable or a cheap rental for a few thrills."
4,A cheapo movie that really keeps you on the edge of your seat!,"It's a cheapo, B-grade movie with no one in it you ever heard of.Having said that...it's fantastic!It's a little slow getting started, but once things start to go downhill for the main characters, the movie is extremely suspenseful, exciting, and entirely realistic.I enjoyed this a lot more than some recent big-budget A-list thrillers."
3,charger,Its an okay charger. The last Solar Charger that I had was much more substantial (was heavier). This one is very good for a homeowner who uses it once in a while. JMK
5,Shakira has a beautiful voice and is very talented,"I got this cd about 2 weeks ago and I love it. The sounds are so invigorating and clear and she sounds great live. I loved the Ojos Asi version and from the whole album I noticed how talented she really is. She knows her own voice and truly knows how to convert it in to music and touch your heart. The percussion on the album is amazing. Although it is very similar to her last album is not something we should not expect, hello, she's performing the songs from her last album which she hasn't gone on tour for to promote. Anyway she is an amazing performer as one can tell by watching the video from her performance. This girl is going far and this album is just a taste of what she can do and I can't wait to hear what she'll bring us next. Buy it and buy all her other albums, you won't be dissapointed."
4,Pretty good,"I see that the reviews are pretty mixed and most of the people either hated it or loved it. In this album's defense, Shakira shows that she is able to sing and to do it well. Her voice is still as good as it used to be showing us that she's doing the right thing. Moscas en la casa is phenomenal. On the least positive side I have to agree that this was not an innovation and it didn't include most of all her greatest hits. My advise is that if you are a Shakira fan this is an important addition to your collection (and in fact I love Shakira and think she did a good job on this one) but if you're just starting on Shakira you'd be better off getting one of her prior CD's."
3,Shakira does ok here,"Well i was a little disappointed in this album, shakira sings really well and the songs are good, too bad this cd sounds like her last one with the songs suffled up, It is exactly the same with the exception of one song from her first album, she should have thrown in a few new songs or a remake or something in english perhaps. Hopefully her next album will be more creative."
1,WHAT?,"This has to be the most idiotic thing i've ever heard of. the name should say it all, shakira (a very bad pop singer with a bad dye) UNPLUGGED. it was for rock groups, who could put down their electric guitars and really give their music a change. every true musician must be really having a cramp about this"
5,Shakira at her best!,"If you are music lover, you will love this albumn. Shakira demonstrates her extrodinary talent creating music to your ears. The lyrics mixed with some Jazz, Mariachi, rock sound extrodinary. The CD is an asset to your collection. This CD deserves a DVD version!"
1,"Shakira; A Good singer, A badly Produced Album","Shakira is undoubtedly a very talented singer, but has unfortunately recorded her worst album. There are certain techniques that a singer uses with acoustic albums, and unfortunately, maybe because of lack of experience, this album is poorly produced. The purpose of an Unplugged album is to provide the listener with an acoustic version of a song that is slightly different of the prior version. I felt that she tried hard to produce an identical version of her hits. In Ciega Sordomuda, Shakira very creatively brings in a Mariachi Band, unfortunately the end result is a version of the song that seemed off sync, and sounded as if they were singing for the first time together. To produce an acoustic album takes certain expertise, and Emilio Estefan Jr. does a poor job as a producer to advise the singer about her performance. The end result is that Shakira, a young women with incredible singing talent, seems like a poor acoustic performer."
2,Trying to hard to be everything to everbody,"She has so many influences in her music it makes you wonder if she has some type of indentity crises going. She mixes Latin, reggae, and tries to throw in Pop and Rock for flavour. Her music is marginal at best. Maybe she should stick with what she's good at and quit trying to be a wanna be everything. The music industry is so concernced with faces now days, real women mucisians are getting overlooked while the media machine oils its jaws with peroxide and silicone and we feed it with our money. People keep ranting about her voice, I guees the addage about the ""squeaky wheel"" gets the most grease is so true."
3,Hello?,"It seems to me that Shakira forgot she has two great albums. Except for Estoy Aqui, she didn't include any of her first albums hits. This was very disappointing to me since I listen to both of her albums from begining to end at least two times a week. This album is okay but it could have been great, and that is the sad part. I really, REALLY hope her english album doesn't disappoint me as much as ""MTV Unplugged"" did."
1,Terrible. The worst unplugged ever.,"I don't know what happened with this production. It could have been very good but the result was a complete mistake.Ok I know that all her fans are going to be ungry and say that this review is not good at all but come on, let's face it. She sings 11 song. 10 of this song are from her album ""Donde estan los ladrones"" and the other one is from ""Pies descalzos"". What?, who can understand this when ""Pies descalzos"" gave her the oportunity to be where she is and brought her several hits (some of them bigger than the ones from ""Donde estas los ladrones""). Also there are no new songs (every unplugged has new songs or at least covers, here NOTHING). The cd only has 11 songs, every unplugged has more than that. So do you think that this is a good production?."
3,good but I am not crazy for it...,"While I adore Shakira and was turned on to her while in Venezuela, I find this cd too similar to her last one....I suppose that is what I get for buying a live album. BUt all of her other cd's are phenomenal, I just didn't care for this one. I am looking forward to her English cd release but I hope her music is as electric in English as it is in Spanish..."
4,shakira = talent,she mixes a whole bunch of stuff in her music and has her own style which is amazing. i think i like her CD's even more than her previous CD's.
4,I dont speak a word of spanish...,"Yet i fell in love with this album.Shakira's muscular voice shines throughout the album. Highlights include the mellow Tu, & Sombre de Ti, where you can actually feel her heartfelt performance. What makes Shakira more interesting is her cultural heritage, providing her the opportunity to blend an amazing Latin/Arabic fusion, as demonstrated in the final, epic track Ojos Asi( which made me think of sand dunes and belly dancers!:)))Buy this album even if you dont speak Spanish. Her music knows no boundaries.:)"
2,2 stars,I don't like it because she plays only the songs from Donde Estan Los Ladrones? And only one song from Pies Descalzos. It sounds like in studio. Here are no jamming and improvisations at all!
4,The best latin singer of world,"Shakira is the best ""latin singer"" of world! Why? because your music talk about your life! She's wonderful!"
3,Not Her Best,"I am a huge fan of Shakira, but I have to say this album isn't her greatest by far. The only songs on here that sound good are Octavo Dia,Moscas en la casa,Donde estan los ladrones,No creo and Ojos asi. The majority of the other songs aren't sung very well, and are somewhat incoherent because of backup singers and Shakiras weird way of singing on this album,like in Estoy Aqui on this album."
5,Few Live Albums Rival This One,"Growing up in Oz during the Saints/Radio Birdman blitz we also had the privilege to compare the local talent with the ""overseas"" acts. Dr Feelgood [post Wilco] visited our shores regularly and THANK GOD!! they did. No-one got the sprung-floor at the [now demised] Cloudland Ballroom jumping like 'The Doctor'. Considering the number of great bands I've seen, Stones, Sabbath, Purple, Floyd, Trower, Dream, Reed, etc....there are few bands that delivered every time! EVERY TIME!! Even now, in their latest incarnations, they still are fantastic live. This album captures those early days in the truest way. To me only 'Get Your Ya Ya's'- Stones and 'Bring It Back Alive' - The Outlaws capture that feeling of 'being there' like 'As It Happens'. Captures the essence of The Doctors with some of the great songs - 'Milk & Alcohol', 'Down To The Doctors', 'Baby Jane' to name afew. Just Do It!Footnote: pity the Oil's were not captured live in their early days. The BEST EVER....LIVE!"
4,serious pub rock,"I saw Dr Feelgood in Sydney and ran out to get ""As It Happens"". These guys looked like they had been around the block a few times, but they really knew their R'n'B. While the lyrics are not that inspiring, they rocked hard and fast and played with all their hearts. This guitar player is a blast, and really rips it up supported by a super-solid rhythm section. If you like rock'n'roll pared down to its roots, this is for you."
3,learning shapes,My two year old learned her shapes very quickly due to this book. Great for toddlers who love Barbie.
2,not happy with this product,when I got the product I was really happy at first until I tried to load in my own picture. the picture came out distorted and could not make out some parts of the faces of the people in the picture.
1,PCStitch,"I had high hopes of converting a poem to a pattern. After several attempts, I am still unable to do so. Instructions are not as easy as described in the offering."
4,Great for intermediate or higher Spanish speakers.,"I bought this particular book a little too premature in my Spanish studies. It is a nice book for those whose levels would be considered intermediate to advanced. It's not intended reading for beginners.Also, for those who care, the stories are from different regions of Latin America and the differences in slang and diction are profound. For example: words that are common in the story from Argentina differ greatly from the story written by the Cuban writer or Peruvian writer. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but worth mentioning if you are thinking perhaps all the stories are similarly written with the same general Spanish verbiage, this is not the case with this book. It is a compilation of several Spanish speaking countries."
1,"Very poor service, defective product, no reimbursement for return shipping","I received a Bluetooth 11/5, it would not charge. I took it to a Nokia shop, they deemed it defective. I mailed it back on 11/8/07 PRIORITY MAIL (at my expense) to CCM Accessories with instructions to replace the Bluetooth and refund my shipping costs. (Haven't heard a word).I called CCM Accessories 11/19/07 at 8:30 AM. The CCM guy said he would call me back in an hour. (That didn't happen). I called again at 1:15 PM on 11/19/07 and the same guy answered. He said he would send an e-mail or call in the next 24 hours and without any offer of resolution. I told him I want a refund, he didn't respond, I hung up. (CCM Accessories has shown VERY POOR customer service skills 718-606-0395, no resolution and no Bluetooth). CCM Accessories has my money has cost me extra money and I have NOTHING."
3,Don't buy if you aren't under 21!,"This book is full of great information for high school students and younger college students, but if you are trying to return to college after a hiatus, this book is far too time consuming, with hardly any good scholarships for adults. All of the time spent searching isn't fruitful enough.... There should be some sort of book for adults returning to college that can help them to locate scholarships and grants that support their endeavors."
2,"She's right, not for students going back to college","I am sure that this huge book is great for high school kids. It is unfortunate that that I graduated in the top 3% off my class leading many organizations and that doesn't matter. See I graduated in 1989 but could not attend school at the time. I finally went back 3 years ago and got a 4.0. I am 30 now and cannot find any sources to help me finish school. There is so much emphasis and praise given to those that want to get their degrees and make a difference, yet no help (without debt). Oh well, good luck to the young!!!!!"
1,NOTHING NEW HERE!,"Features presentations by Dr. Richard Boyland, Ph.D, Freddy Silva, Peter Khoury, and Keith Basterfield. Interviews are several years old. No new UFO information here. Relatively poor technical quality with no production value."
3,Star Kids to Crop Circles,"This disc is a potpourri of testimonial and evidence about various aspects of unexplained--or perhaps previously unexplained--phenomenon. Richard Boylan talks about ""Star Kids,"" Freddy Silva covers crop circles, Peter Khoury recounts his personal experience with a UFO, and it wraps with a lecture on Paranormal Aspects of UFO Phenomenon from Keith Basterfield. If this is your area of interest, you get your money's worth!"
4,Gods With Guns... need I say more?,"This is one of the best books I have seen for Rifts.If anyone remembers Dungeons and Dragons' out-of-print Deities and Demigods, this book is a lot like it, save that the gods in the Rifts setting have access to modern (that is, in 20th century terms, futuristic) weapons, as well as their own powerful, magical weapons.The illustrations are, in keeping with the other palladium books, breathtaking.I won't go so far as to say it is a MUST have for the Rifts player, but, damn it all, it's a great read!"
5,Excellent for an old B&W 1933 movie. Wonderful comic Story with beautiful Music,"Of course the VHS tape is not perfect as would be in movies made today. but if you can look past the B&W and just concentrate on the wonderful voice of this Tiny Tenor. You will thoroughly enjoy it. I also purchased ""Ein Stern felt frum Himmel"" A Star falls from Heaven, In German a Delightful movie made in the 1930s I shows his small stature of 4.11"" tall and shows that he is NOT a dwarf but a perfectly formed ""restricted growth""individual. Handsome to look at and a voice that is better than any of the current Tenors. There never will be another like him. Shame on the Swiss for not saving his life when they had the opportunity. He died in a war/refugee/work camp in 1942,after medical treatment was denied him. A great loss for the future Possibilities."
3,Average Lounge Album,"Although not purely compiled of lounge tracks, this two disc album is more or less true to its' name (there are a couple of tracks that would fall under ambient instead). This is the first release of the series. Disc 1 is dubbed ""Cocktail Lounge"" and disc 2, ""Late Lounge"" although I'm not quite sure how the featured tracks make the distinction.This is a nice set of music to have, but there are much better albums from the same genre out there. Disc 2 is slightly better than the first. Disappointing that the tracks are not mixed.Disc 1, 3/5 stars and Disc 2, 3.5/5 stars."
3,"Good, but not Bellairs","Johnny Dixon is one of my favorite literary characters and I was glad to see someone keep him alive after the untimely death of Bellairs. The book was good and began well enough, but was missing the dark and sinister elements that made Bellairs so brilliant. The humor interjected by Brewster felt out of place and the plot did not compare to those of past books. The whole fortune teller and other world travel seemed a bit hokey...I miss the Catholic undertones and grim scenarios faced by Johnny in the past. The Professor was also denied the passages that make him such an old (but lovable) crab. I hope Strickland writes future novels with darker villans and plots as well as greater involvement of Father Higgins and Prof. Coote. Overall, it was enjoyable and I look forward to new titles."
3,Tara's Song,"""Tara's Song"" was a book that I read about 30 years ago and after reading the ""Shades of Grey"" hype (which is like a ramped up Harlequin Romance and could have been written in one book instead of three, I figured I'd reread ""Heirs of Love"" and ""Tara' Song"" again and see if they were as I remembered them for their passion and suggestion."
3,More of a legend than reality?,"This cream is okay, but nothing spectacular compared to any other foot cream I've used. I have a feeling the success of this brand (their entire line of products) is a triumph of marketing and myth making over reality. The main reason for me to write a review is to warn you, if you've never used this before and are ordering it for the first time, you might find that after it arrives and you're stuck with it you don't much like the way it smells. That's what happened to me (my husband didn't like the smell of it, either). We persevered and used it until it was gone, but we won't be buying it again."
4,"Easily absorbed, but didn't help my cracking nails.","I love how easily this lotion gets absorbed. No more sticky, greasy hands! However, I've used a whole bottle and my splitting nails still split and are fragile. I will continue to purchase due to how nice the lotion feels after application."
4,So far so good!,"I have used this for a month and my dry cracked heels are HEALED! No more dry cracked heels...Have used it on my nails and l like it even though l still break a nail every now and then.. The only reason i'm giving it four stars and not five is because of the bottle. Be very careful when carrying in your purse that it doent squeeze all over your things because that's what happened to me and l lost half of the lotion in the bottom of my bag! YUCK. So l carry mine in a small ""zip lock"" type bag to protect my bag and also any spillage. Other than that l'm so HAPPY that l found a product that actually works! Now.... What took me so long to try it? Lol! The price is RIGHT and it should last me a few monthe because l use it on my nails and heels only. For the price you can't go wrong.... Thank you."
5,The best...,"This is the best skin cream I have ever found. I'm so glad Amazon carries it! I have been using it for years, and was unable to find it in the stores for awhile. Now my husband has started to use it, and he's a doctor! Loves it."
4,"IF you loved the first one, read this sequel :)","To keep it pretty short and to the point, I'd say that if you loved ""Daughters of a Coral Dawn,"" then you should read ""Daughters of an Amber Noon."" The sequel - as is so often the case - is not as good as the original ... but it's not bad, either, and if you finished Coral Dawn wanting to know what happens next, you should check this one out. :)Note: The reader from South Carolina appears to have an odd view of what ""lesbian"" is, though she apparently is one herself. I would agree with the person who said that Amber Noon isn't as lesbian as I would've liked it to have been ... and point out to the reader from South Carolina that having elements such as ""all the men were evil"" and ""all the men were murderers and rapists"" does not make a book ""more lesbian.""Lesbians generally don't hate men - I think you've confused us with married heterosexual women. ;)"
5,Yum! Science fiction!,"I loved this book! I did, do, did! I think I will probably be rereading this one. Correction: I think I will be bopping off to the store with a gift certificate I found and buying the first book. I love it. I'm a huge science fiction fan. And this has just enough to make me happy. It also has a character who reads almost closely like a librarian to me. And I love library type stuff, information architechture and organization. I like strong women. Okay and bad me, I like the conclusion regarding population decline, male infertility and female empowerment. I have a lot of male friends on-line and I don't have a problem with men but given the current political climate in the United States, it is nice to read something that well... subversively like the Da Vinci Code, could have elements of truth and explain things like why some religious zealots want to tell me what I can do with my female body. But that said, that aside, I like it!"
5,"Simple definitions, proofs and plenty of examples","I liked this book when I took linear algebra in undergrad (Math major), and it still serves as a great reference nine years later in grad school. I really appreciate that the theorems and proofs are there, but followed by several examples. I learn best by example, and I love this book. Also, I just loaned it to a friend, and when he gave it back, he mentioned what a great book it was - it helped him solve his SVD problem."
3,RENT RENT RENT first,"This is a PC game ported over to the dreamcast, not with great results. Overall, I would suggest not purchasing before playing a rental. Some people can get into the theme of the game and overlook some defeciencies with game play, others not.These are my gripes: Graphics aren't up to level with what the DC can do. Also, planning missions is laborious for those not patient enough to work out details. There are dozens of button combinations you have to learn to execute options, not very natural. The game can feel more like work than something I'm doing for fun, not for those who don't have patince and problem solving skills and are willing ot put them to work. Personally, this PC game should best have been left on the PC."
2,Rainbow six,This game is very much like a playstation game with the graphics. After playing NFL and CV I expect a little more with the graphics. A little disappointed.
2,Not even close to goldeneye,"This game was a big letdown. The graphics are comparable to an N64 game, and the unfluid motion of the terrorists is like a playstation game. The missions are relativley simple, kill all the terrorists, little deviation from that. This game is not worthy of being compared to goldeneye. Guess I'll have to wait until Half-Life comes out before there is a good shooter on the Dreamcast."
3,You may be disappointed,"I know there are a lot of mixed reviews. I am a disappointed consumer who will be returning this game. I love playing one person/multi person shoot 'em up games--like Quake 3 Arena. I like stealth, strategic planning spy/shooting games--like Metal Gear. But Rainbow Six should not have been made for the Dreamcast. It just doesn't suit to go on a console system. Loading time is horrible, the graphics aren't impressive (for DC), the sound is not so good, and the controls are quite hard to maneuver. The gameplay, however, is potentially good. IF you like stealth, slow, strategic game, this would be an okay game to play. But, here's a warning: when you are playing against many enemies, you will get frustrated with how difficult to aim/control the joystick."
4,i can't control this game,"i'm gona make it simple-good graphics,good characters,good story line, good levels, good difficuly level,good wepons, horrible controls.the controls are the toughest controls i have evr used.But you get used to them, so get the game."
4,It's Finally here!,Well I know most won't believe it but Rainbow 6 for Dreamcast is actually on the store shelves! I bought it about 20 minutes ago and so far it's pretty good but I haven't gotten too far into the game.
1,stupid,"I bought this game based on the great reviews, but this game is DULL DULL DULL. It's too hard to learn, the control is hard, there are too many buttons to learn, the missions are stupid, the instruction booklet is very unhelpful, and the graphics are bad. This game has no action and I'm sorry I wasted my money."
5,Great,"Rainbow Six is a great port of the PC game. The graphics aren't the best, but everything else makes up for it. The sound is wonderful. I haven't finished the game yet but so far it has been challenging and fun. Buy it!"
1,Zzzzz....,"Am I supposed to get excited when I play this game? If the designers were hoping to bore me, they did a great job. Lame sound effects, bogus graphics, and sluggish action make this one pretty dull. Skip it."
1,Not worth it at any price,The absolute worst Dreamcast game I have ever played. I would not even take this game if it was given to me for free.
3,OK for general stuff,"Bought this book intending to use the part of it on decking. However, it's fairly short of detail and is only for small decks laid out on existing patios. Not really very useful at all for decks - or the one I had in mind anyway. However, for general guidance on more mundane aspects of garden DIY it's quite helpful, so OK if you're not doing anything too ambitious."
4,Good for an interested college student,"This introduction was one of the class texts for my graduate-level Lutheran Confessions class. It gives good background information, and is readable, if a little dry. The historical information included is useful to put the documents into a context. I really appreciated having this as a secondary source for the Confessions.This isn't light reading, though- that isn't what it set out to do. It's a good college- or graduate-level textbook, but should be fine for reading on your own as well."
2,disapointed not what i expected,good cust service as always ffrom amazon suppliers but this show was a big disapointment.probably interesting to techies who reccord alot of their own music or pink floyd junkies but for casual fan would have liked more actual footage of recording as it happened not recreations
3,Fair at best,"I was hoping for at least some original concert footage. This disk is comprised of about 1/3 original studio footage (very cool), and 2/3 VH1-style contemporary interviews of the members, Alan Parsons, and a haggardly journalist who makes Keith Richards look like a health freak... -- this is all great the first 3 times ,,,,,,,, then memorized."
2,Where's the music?????????,"Caution! This album sucks big time. Not a single intact musical piece on the whole disc. Only chit chat and boring interviews. All the previous positive reviews are misleading. If your are more interested in Pink's music, this DVD is NOT for you. And it's definitely not worth the high price. What a rip off!!"
2,A disappointment in a way...,"For some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced, one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy. Unfortunately it is not the case. The album is more for FLOYD'S fans who are eager to have all the small details.Well, personaly I don't care that much about these details, all I want is the true staff, for that I would recommend to those who are hesitating, don't buy this DVD, buy the CD...or wait for the true Dark Side of the Moon."
1,THIS IS NOT A CONCERT !,"What a disappointment and letdown! This DVD is not a concert but a documentary of how ""Dark Side"" was created. I felt ripped off also because the DVD sleeve misleads you to thinking that the tracks are taken from live concerts."
2,"Good, but not great","I consider myself a dedicated Pink Floyd fan, so when they release new items like remastered CDs and DVDs, I buy them. It almost seems as if they know that fans like myself will buy the DVD solely because it says Pink Floyd in the cover. This DVD was rather bland compared to the others like; The Wall, or even Roger Waters and Dave Gilmour in concert. However, I did enjoy the VH-1 program, but it was rather short. Also, the bonus features are only material that was cut out of the original program...boring. They can do better than this."
2,Unauthorized Interview Compilation,"This 55 minute documentary was produced without consent of the band, its management, or their record company. Because of this, it is ALL interview and contains no background music nor live clips (contractual reasons I assume).The bulk of this tape is comprised of large chunks of a wonderful documentary (Omnibus, BBC) aired in November of 1994. The other bits and pieces are of varying quality giving this tape more of a bootleg feel.If you're a Floyd fan you'll find something of interest here and there, but if you can, track down the Omnibus special. It's widely available in most bootleg circles and is FAR superior to this tape."
3,Let down,"WARNING: This is just a documentary This is NOT a concert, this is NOT a collection of videos.If you want a documentary 5 stars. If you want a collection of videos 0 starsGet Rodger Waters ""in the Flesh"" that's a good show."
2,Careful as you might feel cheated,There's no one complete song on this album. I was fooled and hope my advise may prevent others from falling in this trap. I love Pink Floyd and hoped to listen and see they perform but nothing like that happens in this DVD.
5,Still the Best,This is a terrific insight into what is arguably the best album released in the past 50 years. The comments and recollections by all members of the band are invaluable to all Pink Floyd fans.
4,"Solid ""making of"" DVD for a classic rock album","Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" is a favorite rock album, with tracks like Breathe and Money ... this DVD is an excellent behind the scenes look at the mixing of, and alternate audio/acoustic versions of, some of the favorites from the album."
5,Great insight into classic album,"This DVD is stunningly good (it hit the shops here on Aug. 23 even when the official release date was Aug. 26). It features interviews with all 4 band members that recorded the album. I particularly like the bits where they single out certain tracks on the mixing desk, so you hear just the vocals or just a certain guitar part etc.Great picture quality and the bonus material is wonderful too.A must have for any Pink Floyd fan."
3,Great if you are a Hardcore pink floyd fan,"Hey, let me level with you guys. This DVD is a little over priced for what you get. The running lenght of the main feature is only 45 minutes and there are a couple of specail features that were not even worth remembering.However, the little bit of documentry you get is very intresting and well worth watching but once you've seen it once you won't want to watch it again. Use your money for ""live at pompee"" because that can be watched over and over and over."
5,More than just a Making Of...,"Many people and online sellers present this DVD as the Making Of The Dark Side... . It's is far more than just that. It's a comprehensive retrospective of the album and its context narrated by every band member, producer, journalist and even the sound engineer (Alan Parson). It includes previously unreleased portions of tracks, solos and choruses from the original DSOTM songs. You can also see Waters, Gilmour and Wright fiddling their instruments while been interviewed and playing portions of Money, Time and The Great Gig... all of this in a quiet ambient, relaxed mood which besides gives us a glimpse of the man more than the musician. There's no footage from live concerts though, just still photos.Don't miss it by no means it is a must for every PF fan. A true 30 year anniversary homage to that masterpiece."
5,WONDERFUL,This is an amazing dvd!!! If you want to get a one on one with roger waters and why they did alot of what they dis this is for you!! Its interveiws about behing the scenes and making of darkside of the moon. Alot of intresting information. And pink floyd fan would want to add this to their collection!
2,Unauthorised Interview Compilation,"This 55 minute documentary was produced without consent of the band, its management, or thier record company. Because of this, it is ALL interview and contains no background music nor live clips (contractual reasons I assume).The bulk of this tape is comprised of large chunks of a wonderful documentary (Omnibus, BBC) aired in November of 1994. The other bits and pieces are of varying quality and DO give this tape more of a bootleg feel.Bottom line: if you're a Floyd fan you'll find something of interest here and there, but if you can, track down the Omnibus special. It's widely available in most bootleg circles and is FAR superior to this tape."
4,Dark Side of the Moon - The story behind the music.,"First consumer beware! If you are lookng for a DVD with all the fantastic video clips of this legendary recording, this is not what you are looking for. There are short clips taken from the videos on certain selections. If you were interested in what was the mind set of the band members and the driving force behind this great album you found what you are looking for. This is one on one interviews with the band members, production personell, and entertainment journalist of the time. You will learn what makes this recording one of the greatest of all time. After watching this video myself, I have enjoyed listening to the music more. You start to hear the little things that define Pink Floyds music that you may have never really noticed before. understanding the music will bring a greater appreciation to it."
5,Perfect bookends,"All grown up now and still in tune. Pink Floyd has returned from the dark side of the Moon and, boy, do they have some stories. And answers, faces and voices for old questions. Ask someone to get you this DVD for Xmas."
3,"Good Info, Not very Re-watchable","I thought this DVD was a pretty good one to sit down and watch for the first time. It was very informative but the songs were mostly cut out by the documentary part of it. They rarely, if ever, played a full song without interruption and I guess I expected that a little bit.I gave it three stars cause I think the info is very good and it shows how Dark Side was made pretty well.On the other hand, you (I) will probably have to wait a while before you watch it again. I impulse bought it several months ago and haven't watched it since."
4,Excellent documentary,"Very informative, with an emphasis on interviews with Roger Waters and David Gilmour. Not surprisingly, Waters spends most of his time talking about the thematics of the album and its songs while Gilmour - who performs a few tunes in his studio with only an acoustic guitar - focuses on the music. But then, that's pretty much the way Floyd operated at its peak. Gilmour still sounds great. I only wish they'd spent a little time discussing how much they can't stand one another as it makes for great drama."
5,A Must Read!!!!,I have read and loved every one of Elizabeth Berg's novels and this is another classic!!
4,A lovely read,"This does not purport to be ""deep"" literature and it is not -- it is just a fictional story, too sweet and perfect for reality, about the year after a beloved husband dies. But it is full of lovely surprises: funny jokes, good stories, and some real wisdom. I loved best the focus on small things, and on enjoying them all."
4,Beautiful story of recovery from grief,"****This is the story of a woman's recovery from the death of her husband, her soulmate, with whom she had a wonderful marriage. It is honest, compelling, and even though it deals with a serious subject, entertaining. Elizabeth Berg's writing style is lyrical and beautiful.The main character, Betta, who is only around 50 years old, learns to build a new life for herself in unexpected ways. Even if you are not dealing with grief, or if the subject scares you off, this book is worth the read, because Betta's grief is presented in a human way that everyone can relate to. The simple things, ordinary people, and everyday life activities she takes comfort in are common to all of our lives.It is a fairly short book (just over 200 pages), easily read in an evening.****"
2,Disappointing,"I have been an Elizabeth Berg fan in the past, and so I was disappointed in her latest ""Year of Pleasures."" I felt it was rather clumsily written; the dialogue of the characters often did not ring true (especially in the case of the middle school age character--it seemed as though she was trying to mimic the rhythms of how she has observed kids nowadays conversing, but at a great distance). Also, really skilled writing should (in my opinion) almost force the writer to come to the point of view of the character. Well, I did feel for Betta in the beginning, but my liking for her soon wore thin. Maybe because her relationship with her husband as described in the book sounded cloying and annoying; couples who completely shut out the world to the exclusion of all others simply are irritating to everyone around them! Being aware of this annoyance the whole way through kept me from being really drawn into the story. It just didn't come alive for me."
2,Totally unrealistic,"I have read ""Open House"" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home? They must have been laughing at her behind her back! There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war."
3,Good but it didn't stay with me,"I think that Elizabeth Berg is an excellent writer. She writes grief so well. I really enjoyed this novel while I was reading it. I liked the characters, the story and the writing. It was an emotional story and I felt Betta's pain of being widowed and alone. Berg does a wonderful job of making her characters real to the reader. This was a good book and I can see why some people just loved it. But this story just didn't stay with me when I was done reading it."
4,Pleasurable Read,"This novel is a light, but affecting read. It doesn't delve too deeply into the characters' backgrounds and psyche, but still is an engrossing analysis of the ups and downs of widowhood. The main character is a recent widow that you come to care about and the realizations she has during the book are gems of wisdom for all of us. It's a book that you don't want to end. It's comforting , but also piques your curiosity about the future paths the characters will take."
3,Unrealistic,"While I enjoyed reading the book, I don't find that the scenario represented here is realistic for most. I thought the part about going through the grief process was true enough, but how many people would be so whiny when they have so much money? It would be great to be able to write a check for a house. And then she complains about not being able to sleep in it! I cringed when she went over to the handyman's house and asked to sleep there. It's a simple read, but not memorable."
5,Once started this book could not be put down.,elizabeth Berg takes a sad subject of widowhood and turns it into a compelling story one woman who has overcome sadness and finds there is life and happiness while still being alone. All of her books are good reads.
5,Year of Pleasures--amazing,"As usual, Berg draws you in with nuanced characters who discover themselves over the course of the novel. i couldn't put it down. must-read"
2,No Resemblance to Reality,"I kept hoping that Elizabeth Berg's latest novel, ""The Year of Pleasures"" would start to get realistic, but alas, it never does. The plot is simply the year of grieving that protagonist, Betta does for her oh-so-perfect husband, John, and their oh-so-perfect marriage after he oh-so-perfectly dies. Yawn and Yech. Only in fiction, folks."
1,Give me a break,"I have loved many of Elizabeth Berg's writings. But the saccharin sweet PERFECT relationship Betta had with her husband was really too much. And the tidy little $1.9 million dollars she had that enabled her to buy a prime rib for Benny just made me queasy. Women like to read about characters they can relate to.........not a fantasy life where the main character isn't worried about money, or children, or exhaustion."
3,A bit trite,"Usually, I am a big fan of Elizabeth Berg -- her books and characters usually sparkle with wit and truth. This is not the case with this book, however. I found Betta's character to be self-absorbed, immature, and trite. I found the character of her recently-deceased husband, John, to be astoundingly unrealistic. He greeted Betta every morning with ""Welcome to Tuesday, Betta."" Every Sunday, he toasted their ""continuous honeymoon"" over their sushi dinner. The story of how she mourned him would have been so much more layered if their marriage had been more real -- John was a cliche, and so was their marriage. Then Betta moves to a perfect town, and is instantly surrounded by friends, new and old, who seem to be wholly interested in her well-being. Nothing in the novel rang true to me. That being said, Berg does have a gift of making ordinary situations shine with a certain splendid light, and that is what made me stick with this novel."
1,Cloying,"I've read a few of Berg's books before, and was not unpleased by what I had read. The books passed the time and were pleasant, easy reads. Perhaps I've reached the saturation point with this one. I found it dreadful. Its puffiness and insipidness gave me a headache. Nothing in it 'rang true'. Really..yikes..I just put it down<unfinished, admittedly> and feel as though I ate far too much cotton-candy, or watched too many bunnies frolicking in sunny fields,with an occcasion cloud for dramatic effect. I get the feeling that Ms. Berg feels she OUGHT to 'take pleasure in lttle things', but really doesn't. The writing about raspberries in cream, etc is so formish as in : 'this is what I would write if I were a wealthy widow moved by raspberries in cream'. Skip it. Try one of her other books. This is a sugary nightmare."
3,I kept hoping for more,"I love Elizabeth Berg's books, but I was disappointed with this one. I listened to the audio book and kept on listening because I thought it would get better. It was an average novel and the only time I thought it might get more interesting was when the relationship between Betta's young friend Matt and his girlfriend started to get interesting. Unfortunately, that story did not get developed. It felt like and abridged version, but it wasn't."
5,Best One Yet!,I bought this book this morning and have almost finished it already!It's that readable...entertaining and beautiful. This may be my favorite Elizabeth Berg book yet.
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed."
3,Another good Berg book...,"Sometimes a great love does suspend you in your own life. This is a great story about what happens when that love comes to an end, and you have to rebuild your own life. It's different that most Berg novels, and somehow quite the same. An individual stuggle, deep and moving, very well developed. I know I say this a lot in my Berg reviews, but the manner in which, and the depth in which she knows her characters is unmatched. I always feel like I know them, and have been in their house.In the book the main character struggle, and reconnection to her past, while simultaneously building a new life in a new town makes a story that you will remeber, and love."
4,My Favorite Berg,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I think the reader is excellent, and compared to other Berg books I have read (listened to), this one is by far my favorite."
4,Great for Book Clubs!,"I always find Elizabeth Berg's novels to be very thought provoking. How would I find myself after many years of marraige to be alone, trying to find my way? Great book for bookclubs, should spark some great discussions."
2,Too Cute,"This novel was a terrible disappointment for me because I have enjoyed almost all of Elizabeth Berg's previous novels. This one, however, is so unrealistic, so phony and so easy to see where the story is leading. An idyllic marriage, a perfect little town, ideal new neighbors and acquaintances, friends who rush to the aid of the new widow even though she has ignored them for 30 years, and so on. Too treacly by far!"
2,Not her best,I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it. I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked. But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended.
3,Atypical,"Hopefully this is just a detour and not the direction that Elizabeth Berg is going with her writing. Predictable, unrealistic and undeveloped plot and characters. Her gifted use of language is the only salvation for this otherwise disappointing book."
2,Where's the substance?,"I've read some of Ms. Berg's other books and enjoyed them - I am sorry to say this one was a real disappointment - the premise is interesting and I thought the book got off to a good start but the author could not sustain the tempo - about 2/3 of the way through, it seemed as if the author had realized she only wanted the book to be a certain length, and so she'd better be about getting it done - so no sooner than are a host of characters introduced then the story is over - it never was very clear what the pleasures were - the book turned out to be a trite treatment of the topic - I would not recommend."
4,With reservations.....,"I just finished this latest book by Elizabeth Berg and it was lovely. It follows Betta, a 50-something widow, along her path of grief following the death of her beloved husband. The book, however, was a bit too ""enchanted"" for me....even though Betta was suffering from the loss of her husband, somehow things just fell into place too easily for her.Finding the perfect house the first day in a new town, and having friends rush to her aid after not corresponding with them for 30 years --these were things that were just too good to be true!Many parts of the book were glimpses into the past: her college years, her courtship, parts of her marriage, her husband's dying. These glimpses helped to flesh Betta out, but she was not nearly as well-developed a character as Nan in ""Pull of the Moon"".While coincidence played a bit more of a role than I usually like, Berg's lovely writing and her understanding of grief overcame the negatives.I would recommend this book....with reservations."
2,A Formula Plot,"I agree with the review entitled ""Cloying."" This is a formula plot about a woman left alone in mid-life who goes to a new town and lives happily ever after. Anne Tyler has done it much better. Everything falls into place too perfectly to be interesting. She buys an old house and moves in quickly - no 30-day wait for closing? No inspection problems? Her life is perfect.For a fresh take on the older woman left alone in mid-life, read Porter Shreve's ""Drives Like a Dream."" You won't recognize any familiar plot elements in it."
3,"Engaging voice, but could have been so much more","This book must be good because I am still thinking about it, but I am also kind of annoyed. The author knows how to write in a voice that makes you feel like you are listening to a friend, however, it seemed like there were so many stories wanting to be told that were never really developed here. I kept reading because I wanted to find out where Berg was going with all of this and because the narrator's voice was engaging. Somewhere around page 100 or so, I realized that there may never be an actual plot but just a bunch of incidents that happen to her in her new life. I guess that I'm glad that I read it because it was somewhat enjoyable, but I wish Berg would have finished some of the false starts that she created rather than just leaving them to sit there. Parts of the book were very well written and brought tears to my eyes. Other parts seemed like bad scenes from a Lifetime Channel movie."
2,Extremely Unrealistic! Not like her other books at all!,"I found this story line to be interesting - a woman starting over after the death of her beloved husband. While there are some great analogies in the book, overall it is a huge disappointment! It is hard to believe that relationships from college are just picked up where they left off while all her friends admit that she just exited their lives years ago! It would have been more realistic if time was taken to renew the relationships. Plus, the other characters in the book seemed a bit unreal as well. If only life was that sugary...I am an optimistic person, but this story just seemed to good to be true. It is a shame because I usually love this author's work. It does not portray the real feelings felt by a widow. I have a friend who felt very alone after her husband died. This book makes the relationships and reconnections seem all to easy thereby losing the meaning of a ""pleasurable"" life rebuilt after a strong love."
2,Doesn't measure up to her other books,"I have to say I was disappointed with this latest book. I have enjoyed most of the author's past books but this one was so unrealistic. Looking at some of the unfavorable reviews, I have to agree with these folks.The revived friendships from thirty years ago - oh please!Sell your home and buy a new one with 1.6 million to spare!Open up a shop in small town within a couple of months of your husband's death. (what are the statistics on the survival rate of these types of shops?)All these very friendly people - it would have been more realistic if at least a few were like the mean old lady she purchased her home from.The radio in the attic - stupid. What?? did an invalid climb into her attic sometime before she moved and plug a radio in to come on in the middle of the night only???It goes on and on."
5,Great home cooking!,"This is a wonderful cookbook. It is actually the 2nd one I have purchased, the first on having been lost in a move. I just had to replace it. These recipes are so authentic, I was raised on Creole cuisine and these allow me to make food that tastes just like my grandmother's."
5,My tried and true favorite Cajun cookbook,I first got this book back in about 1982. After divorcing I reaquired a copy in 2000. I have many other New Orleans cookbooks which I love but this it the one I always go back to. The recipes work and you can feel the love in the book. Chicken Pontalba and Crawfish Cardinale are just a couple of my favorites. I doubt you will be disappointed if you get this book. It is certainly among my all time favorite cookbooks.
3,Confusing Recipes and Directions,"This is a romantic book. I have read it cover to cover and it brought up wonderful memories of the brief time I have spent in New Orleans and vicinity. So far, I have made only one dish (White Bean Soup) so far and it was very bad. I found the directions confusing, which may have contributed to the failure. I also suspect they got the recipe from some colorful Cajun type sitting under a live oak smoking something funny. However,in spite of my nasty comments, I will make good use of this book as a source of ideas to adapt my tried and true dishes. As an example, I will adapt the bean soup recipe in an attempt to replicate a memorable bean soup I had in Tupelo, Missippi many years ago.This not a cookbook for inexperienced cooks"
5,Great Film... Nearly true to the book,"This is a really well made film. The attention to detail is astounding. The clothes, the ships, the language. Everything is just right for this date and time.The film contains the main theme of the first half of the first book in the series. There were a few deviations from the book, but they do not detract from this film. It's great to actually see the workings of the ships. I especially enjoyed seeing the 'tween decks area and the great cabin of the larger ships. A picture is worth a thousand words.The only problem that I have with the film is the fact that some of the characters are not introduced. Also, if you never read the book, you might be a little lost. I kept trying to figure out which officers were which. Consciously listening to the names.Aside from that, the film was great. Just about everything I expected. The seamen that are under Hornblower's command are well played. I plan on getting the next DVD in the series very soon."
5,A husband gift must!,"If your husband is into British stuff and battle, he will love this DVD. Perfect gift for birthday or father's day. If you are a Jane Austenite, you might enjoy it too."
3,Not Your Forester's Hornblower,"While this production is excellent, I cannot give it full marks as an adaptation of the books. One of the primary themes of the books is the contrast between the inner man (plagued by self-doubt, fear, seasickness) and the exterior (cold and commanding). They form an extended essay on Forester's view of the nature of command, cowardice and bravery, and the human will fighting with emotions. Much of what raises the Hornblower books above other swashbucklers of the genre goes on inside Hornblower's head. Obviously this is very hard to portray on the screen, and this series more or less declines to try. Great production values, great historical adventure, but not the Hornblower I know and love."
1,Buyer Beware!,"What a disappointment! Video plays like a home movie (and not a well-made one, at that). Scenes in video are highlighted with captions; no narration whatsoever. Music sound quality is very poor; reasons for selecting music for various scenes unclear. This was a waste of time and money!"
5,"Excellent, but can be bought cheaper!","The best infuser I've ever used. It's made in Germany, and you can always trust German quality. It's a bit pricey on amazon though: I recently purchased two more of these babies from specialteas.com at under $6 a piece. You have to pay $2.99 for shipment there, but if you order teas from there anyway (as I occasionally do - along with adagio.com these are the best places to get high quality tea; they are cheaper and much better quality than Teavana), you will not pay anything extra for shipping the infuser."
3,Too small!,"I think the measurements are misrepresented.They say ""Filter size M fits diameters from 2,3 to 3,5-inch"" but really it will only steep up a mug with an opening of no more than 2.7 inches total, which is way smaller than the common mugs. Anything over that will still make the tea, but it won't be a closed infusion, so it would be no different than any other infuser with no lids."
5,Works better than any tea ball I've ever owned,"This tea screen keeps out all but the finest particles. My rooibos loose teas no longer float around my cup of tea. Even if the tea screen is a bit too small for some of my mugs, it balances on one edge. It fits best in 8-12oz mugs. And it's easy to clean. The holder on the bottom also can be used on the top to keep tea warmer while it steeps. I gave this to all my tea-drinking friends for gifts this year and they love it too."
4,Very handy for your looseleafs.,Very convenient and well put together. Definitely beyond worth the price. It does sometimes worry me that I'm steeping plastic in boiling water.
3,Not the best out there.,"My husband and I recently bought both this and the FORLIFE Brew-in-mug Extra-fine tea infuser with lid, and the FORLIFE infuser is our favorite- hands down. Most of our cups have 3.75-4"" openings, and the FORLIFE infuser fits them perfectly, is more stable and the larger top better fits to seal in the heat. Perhaps if we'd purchased the larger sized Finum it would have worked better, but we do have some smaller cups, which this does fit. My main complaint is that the smaller diameter opening of this Finum strainer allows for more heat escape while the tea steeps and the strainer will wiggle quite a bit in larger diameter cups and is unstable. We haven't had any problems with sediment in our cups--but we use full tea leaves from Coffee Bean Direct (their Earl Grey--delicious). Overall, it's a fine product, but I wouldn't purchase it again."
2,broke after 1 use,"I wanted to love it so badly, but after 1 use, it somehow developed a puncture wound in the side, allowing tea leaves to escape. I love everything else about it, but I did not expect the material to be so fragile/cheap. Now I have to send it back, where I will probably be charged half the price in restocking fees."
2,Not the best idea;does not fit as advertized,I just purchased this brewing basket with a tea pot. The tea pot is large. I like to make a pot of tea and have at least six cups. I only got this infuser because it was recommended on the item page as suitable for the large pot. It is way too small. It will not rest on the brim of the teapot's lip. It falls to the bottom of the pot requiring a major extraction to get it out. I only kept it because the retuning process is such a hassle. I am disappointed and unhappy. It should not be urged on customer since it fails to fit large teapots.
2,tea basket,tea basket is OK lid does not stay on to have a lid is pointless to say the least. but as for the basket it works great but I needed a lid to stay attached this one does not.
1,brewing basket,This would be fine to make individual cups of tea. However I prefer to make pots of tea .The basket tilts over in the tea pot as well as in a stove top pot. There is no top and the tea can not be secured in the basket.
2,Lid does not attach to basket!,"I was surprised that the lid does not actually attach to the basket. It doesn't screw on, snap in - nothing. I guess the design is for tea pots that are not taller than the infuser. I dropped mine into my pitcher of hot water - thinking - maybe it floats? Nope - sank right to the bottom, and emptied all my tea leaves everywhere. Now I'm back to shopping for a large tea ball that actually closes.Update 09/2011: Now that I have more experience with brewing large pots of tea, I still think this basket is a poor design. This is designed to hold enough tea to brew a pitcher's worth, but it is not designed to easily sit in a pitcher. The Finum bags may not allow full expansion of the leaves, but they are certainly easier to handle.As for the folks who needed to insult me in your comments - congratulations, that must have made you feel very smart and good about yourselves!"
5,Great for tea...,'Much nicer then the little metal-ball option that we had been using previously.. 'Works great in my large cups or kettle.
4,Nice large size,"We use this for brewing ice tea, holds about 10 or 12 tablespoons of tea leaves. The weave is nice and tight so the tea leaves don't escape. I really like the fact that I can put it in the dishwasher when needed.Cons: No lid or cap (the black plastic disc is a drip tray not a lid that fastens securely). This would get five stars if it had a lid and stainless steel chain so I could use it like a huge tea or herb infuser and hang it in the pitcher of hot water. As it is now I fill it with tea leaves, place it in the brewing container, and poor water over the leaves until the water is about 3/4 the way up the basket. If I put too much water in, the basket floats then flips over dumping loose leaf tea into the water (defeats the purpose of the basket at that point)."
4,Can someone please tell me the size of lid?,"I bought the large size to put into a tea maker by teavana, in order to make concentrated tea.Unfortunately the lid is too wide to fit in the tea pitcher.Can someone please tell me the width of the widest part of the lid for the medium size?Perhaps that can work for me..Thanks."
5,Creates the perfect cup of tea every time,I have tried other tea strainers and this one is by far the best. The strainer holes are the right size so no tea escapes. It fits nicely in my little tea pot and in my cups too. Cleans up easily too. I love tea and I love the Teeli Brew Basket.
5,Same as MSR Mugmate for half the price.,"This product is perfect for great coffee while backpacking or camping. It fits in my insulated mug and probably just about any other one perfectly so i just put my coffee grounds in and pour hot water over them until full. It is also long enough that you can let it steep for some time, I usually do about 5 minutes or so. Other suggestions for it would be tea of coarse, especially an immune booster for serious winter hiking, also, I filter water through it because i don't have a backpacking purifier. It takes most of the large particles out of the water and then you just add iodine tablets."
5,Perfect for large mugs!,"I have been using the smaller size of this filter basket in my extra-large mug, with two teaspoons of tea leaves, and it was just too crowded for the leaves to steep properly. I was delighted to find they make this larger size. It's the perfect size for my mug, and gives the leaves plenty of room. Great price, too. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Amazing!,"Absolutely love it! I can now enjoy loose leaf teas without any hassle. Just put some tea leaves in the infuser, put the infuser in my mug, and pour water. Amazing!"
3,"Nice, smaller than expected, and not too secure","I ordered this basket primarily to cold brew iced coffee, although it would work equally well with tea. For a ""large"" basket, it is definitely smaller than I expected. When filled with ground coffee it can brew just a little less than a quart of cold-brewed coffee in about 24 hours if placed in a two-quart pitcher. I suppose it potentially could brew more, but the problem is that the lid just sits on the top, and does not fasten to the basket in any way. This means that if you fill your water over the top of the basket, you risk losing the contents because everything will float out (the lid is plastic and will float too). Also, given the size, I'm not sure that the amount of coffee it holds would brew much more than what it already can.It's a nice fine mesh and works well for the size and quantity but could use some improvements."
5,Very good for steeping tea,I doubt I can add anything in addition to what other reviewers have said. This does a great job of steeping tea that I ended up buying two (one for myself and one for my parents). I also recommend going with the larger size as it is the perfect size for a mug. The strength/potency of your tea is more dependent on the amount of leaf you put in anyways.
5,For Great Cup of Tea,"I was concerned when I purchased the filter that it may not fit my 43 year old ceramic tea pot, but it fits perfectly and cleans up easily."
5,Works great for coffee,"I bought this because it was identical to, and less than half the price of, the MSR version. I bought it so I could have coffee on a long-distance bicycle trip. I suspect it would be ideal for backpackers too - same desire to shave pounds. It makes great coffee, so no need to carry instant with me anymore. In fact, the coffee's so good I don't need to carry creamer or sugar either. Simple, nothing to break, lightweight, great coffee, plus it fits inside my cookset. Couldn't ask for more."
5,Love it!!,"I am very happy with my purchase! I love making lose leaf tea--and this gives me the option without having little ""floaters"" in my cup. Great buy!!"
4,Just what I was looking for.,"I got this because I have a 32 oz. LL Bean water bottle which I like to take Yerba Mate in. I wanted a filter I could pop into my bottle or cup with loose tea. This was smaller than I expected but is also a tiny bit too large to fit snugly in my bottle (my fault I didn't measure). It does it's job though! It's also got a lid which is nice but would be NICER if the lid screwed on (that's why 4 stars). That way you can reuse your loose tea leaves, which is especially nice with Yerba Mate because it only gets better the second time around."
4,Church on the down low,I've heard about lots of scandalous things happening in church but this book took the icing off the cake. A call girl service started by members on the deacon board. I couldn't believe all the sex that went on at Greater Hope with the pastors and different women outside of their spouse. This was absolutely a great book to read.
2,Disappointed!!!,"After reading the online reviews (many of which were positive) I decided to purchase this book to read while on vacation. I have to say, I was very disappointed! I couldn't believe that it had been given such great reviews - the book was boring, the characters were underdeveloped and lacked substance. There was nothing believable about the novel. I hope Michele does better with her next novel."
3,A getting by read,"When I read the back of Church Folk and the reviews, I thought that I was in for so much laughter and amazement. Church folk was an o.k. read. It had its climaxes that would make you laugh, but overall it was a slow read. The author did a wonderful job describing the characters clothes and painting the pictures of the people in the book. The story was just slow. It is not a waste of time, but it is not on my favorites list."
5,Simply Wonderful,Church Folk is a wonderful novel. The characters in the book can easily be recoginzed in congregations all across America. The book was funny and inspiring. I enjoyed reading every single page.
3,"Good story, but too many characters.","Good story. Very interesting, at times... My only complaint is that there were too many characters. I kept having to go back and remember who was who. (Deacon so-and-so... Pastor blah blah blah... Too much to remember.) Otherwise, it was a good book."
3,"Well uhh, let's see...","...it started out interesting. Theophilus Simmons sounds like a believable character. But why portray the church, particularly this denomination, as such scandelous people? As Christians, we should practice conveying messages of hope not destruction. That includes Christian novels. I thought the emphasis on the 'wrong-doings' of the church was not necessary; at least not to that extent. Remembering that we are to be witnesses for the kingdom of God and drawing people to Him, not away from Him."
2,Okay Reading,"I liked this book because it shows the weaknesses that even good pastors face, but this book portrays pastors as human and not above reproach. However, the main characters in the book lacked Character, in my opinion, because of some of the choices they made and the way they chose to handle certain situations. I feel that the sexual aspects of the book I could have done without. Being that it was supposed to be christian fiction the sexual parts were totally unexpected and uncalled for--It would have been a good story without it. If not for the sexual parts, I would have rated this book at 5 start."
5,A Diamond in the Rough..a rare gem,"Church Folk rested patiently on the end of the display as if likened to a tour group waiting for a bus. There were numerous new copies to select and carry home. Being raised in the church and at the time of my reading, I was attending the Methodist church. Church Folk weaves a tale of fiction, one thinks or hopes as fiction. The characters and procedural hierarchy of the church flavor each savoured page. In fact,I read the book much slower...just to make it last. I found it to be so humorous and true in much of the story."
5,"Wow, what a delicious, precious story!","Like others, I did not know what to expect. As a Christian, I did not want to read any book about church folk! However, my coworker gave me the book. I could not put it down. I have never read a book written with so much integrity and wisdom. I got totally engrossed in Theophilus and Essie, not to mention all of the wonderfully juicy twists and turns! This book is amazing! I want to read more of Ms. Bowen's work!"
2,Not good at all,"My mom found this book that someone left behind while on vacation in Bermuda. She said it was a good book so I decided to pick it up. Boy..was I not pleased!! Others have already commented on the absurdities throughout the book. I agree with whomever said that the long statements thrownout while the preacher is speaking is true. There are never statements said longer than ""Amen"" and ""That's right""..but mini-monologues while a preacher is tryin to preach..NEVER.I don't know..the book had a good storyline..but you could tell this is the author's first book. Back to the storyboard, Ms. Bowen."
3,Confusing at times but exciting till the end!,"I enjoyed the journey that the author took me on in this novel but I was led astray at times. The character are very complex and interesting at times but I would have to agree with other reader's about the ""holes"" in the story. I went from Theo courting Essie to her being the first lady in a blink of an eye. I would have enjoyed the wedding if it had been included. Some of the character were well developed and described, Glodean, and others I felt were over done, Marcel. There were way to many names of preachers, bishops, conventions, and churches at times to follow. Simplicity is the spice of life. I wouldn't say it's a best seller, but it's worth reading :-)"
3,Fashion Show,"This book was more about a church fashion show than anything else. Although it was lovly how she described every outfit in great detail, but the fashions overtook the essence of the story. The character, Glodean, as described in the jacket of the book was suppose to highlight the story. However, in fact, she did not offset the rough interior as the author describes her. You will get confused with all of the names of the reverends, bishops, and other folks. The best part about this book was the last few chapters on the ""set-up"" of Marcel. A church organization having a whore house in a funeral parlor is a bit outrageous. You'd have to be an atheist to hypocrite and play games and things like that with God? It's really scary to play church like that. I guess it's possible but it seems highly improbable. I read a book called ""Waiting to Exit Hell,"" and it was just too good. I highly recommend that book. It's on the really real!"
4,culture,"One way to learn about the culture of a people is to read fiction about their culture. I work with inner city children, and have been driving through their neighborhoods for years. On every other block there is a church. I have met many pastors. I never knew though, the inner dynamics of what going to church meant, nor did I know the vast web of churches and preachers. This book has whet my appetite for others like this one, down and dirty life among churches and their congregants."
5,Great Collection of Beautiful Homes,"This is the ultimate luxury home collection! It has over a hundred of beautiful floor plans, many with gorgeous full-color photos. I really enjoyed this book!"
5,Great book of dreams,"Even though the houses in this book are well outside my price range, it is fun to look at them."
2,Too much South Florida,"I bought this book for ideas on Luxury Homes in general. I have lived all over the US, as well as parts of Europe. This book will please you if you want to build a home in South Florida . . . that looks like the other homes in South Florida. Otherwise, like me, you will be dissappointed. In other words, Dan Sater lacks variety in his style.Its really sad, because even within the borders of FL, there are a great many other styles to represent. Again, if you want to keep up with the Joneses in Boca, this is your book."
2,Faux Motown,This is an album of covers by ex-Motown artists on the ubiquitous Motorcity label and should be avoided at all costs!!
2,very preditactable,verysame as other books no surprises. the outcome was could be predicted long beforethe book ended. Somewhat boring.Not recommende for the avidreader.
2,predictable prey,The story line is very familiar nothing was left to the imagination. The characters were common and boring.it appeared to be a first novel rough draft.
4,Night Prey,Enjoyed this bookvery much. It had Just enough suspense to keep you coming back. A hard book to put down. .
3,night prey,Not a bad read by any means. A little predictable but fast enough paced to keep you interested.I did enjoy it
4,tricky,This story is very different. Many angles and surprises along the way. Jake is very believeable and so is Robbi in a way. It has a twisty ending. Always good.
1,Terrible Text,"I am a chemistry TA and am currently being forced to use this book in an analytical class I am taking. Kellner has succeeded in putting together an utterly useless book in his ""Analytical Chemistry."" Skoog makes a much better instrumental textbook. In Kellner, Equations are derived and used with no definition of variables, and the same variable (with different, unknown meanings) are used in later equations as well. In the text, terms coined by Kellner are used, but never explained. Reading Kellner only confuses the reader. To add insult to injury, there are very few example problems. Overall, I would never recommend this book to anyone for anything. Needless to say, intuitive knowledge is more useful than the text."
4,Clarion CM1625 6.5 inch marine speakers,Speakers were just as described. Sound good but would probably be much better with an amp to boost power. I am pleased with the purchase.
4,Clarion CM1625 Speakers,Very good sound reproduction with ample base. I use the speakers in the cockpit where a sturdy exterior grill prevents damage during sailing and sheet handling.
3,"Good speakers, but do not hold up for marine use","Well I am ordering these speakers again because they fit the 4 cutouts on my boat. But I do not like them very much. They just do not hold up. Two of them do get some water, but the other two stay dry. It does not matter they will only last 2-3 years. I tried to replace them with Boss 6.5 speakers but they are too large for the cutout. These speakers are not worth thier high price."
4,Very Useful,"I purchased this product because I have read it, and shared several copies over the past few years. I'm stocking up to have some available when the need arises.It is well written and deals compassionately with the subject of a loved one's dying as well as offering all kinds of helpful advice and ideas."
4,Excellent album.,"My favorite is track 7: Entre Deux Feux. This is my second FF album. Personally, I prefer this one over the Si Dieu Veut...."
2,Disappointing,"Having used Apple Pectin shampoo many years ago my mom remembered liking it very much. I ordered a bottle of it for her and it arrived today. Fortunatly, it did not ooze out of the bottle, because the pop open lid was raised. Since the shampoo is not runny, it was okay. I unscrewed the top, thinking it probably had a safety seal, and that was what prevented it from leaking. However, there was no safety seal.She was so disappointed. We both thought it did not smell strongly of Apple Pectin, the pleasant fragrance remembered. According to her it lathered up fairly well, but didn't feel clean, so she rinsed that out and used more to lather again. Then it felt as if she had used Prell or something that really stripped the hair squeeky clean, and she knew she would absolutly have to put a conditioner on her hair. Her thought was, Oh no, I have 33.8 oz of this stuff left that I don't even like...I wonder if I can donate it to somebody!"
3,Not what I needed,"I was hoping for more detailed information, not very technical. I am not restoring , but bringing back to life and freshening up a truck stored by my father for 50 years. I was looking for detailed info and pictures on a 1930 closed cab; showing the interior, trim, close ups, etc. it is still interesting and worth the money to have it in my library of Model A books."
1,1971 Silver?,"I'm not aware of any silver or silver clad coins minted (even in error) in 1971. I'm not saying any deception was intented, only that the coin is a copper-nickel clad coin that has been misidentified as silver.40% Silver-clad 50 cent pieces dated 1965-1969 were minted, and 1970 silver clad 50 cent pieces were also minted (for collectors only, not released for circulation). In 1971, One-Dollar Eisenhower 40% Silver-clad pieces were sold by the mint for collectors (again, not for general circulation), but to my knowledge all 1971 Kennedy Halves (even those minted for collectors) are composed of copper and nickel. My suggestion would be to take the coin to a reputable coin dealer (one that has been in business a long time)and have it graded. If you do have a genuine 1971 Silver/silver clad Kennedy 50 cent piece, it is very rare and worth much more than the value listed."
4,"The same old story, a fight for Liberty or Conformity...","An excellent work Peter Gill pulls few punches in his look at the role of MI5 the British Security Service.An account that is never dull it brings together anecdotal and factual accounts of MI5 activity that breach the authors ideas of what a democratically accountable British Security Service should look and act like. Seeking to contrast the 1989 Security Service Act with its opposite Statutes in; Canada, Australia and the USA Mr Gill makes a powerful case for more openness in MI5 activity.His delineation of the Gore-tex state (or should that be Gannex Peter)and subsequent recommendations make for a powerful argument. A recommended text for both undergraduate students and amateur buffs alike.MR P. Gill teachs Criminology at the John Moore's University in Liverpool England."
1,Poor Condition,I purchased the Sylvania dual deck player/VCR combo in the month of September. I was really excited about this purchase. When I received the dual deck player VCR / combo and connected it the doors of the VCR combo was opening and closing.It would never close.The VCR will turn itself on when I have turned it off and it would not record. This was a poor purchase. This was definetly a lemon.
1,Not a good investment,"After I set up the unit, connecting it to the television, I tried to open the DVD Loader and it simply would not open. Hence, I cannot play any DVDs on this particular unit (obviously). But, the VCR component seems to be working fine, and as I have a lot of VHS tapes saved from the good old days, I can at least watch those on it. I'm sorry to write a bad review. I should have known better than to order a product like this online."
1,nd AV2,"I hooked it up everyway I could to get it to work, but I got nothing so I returned to have my purchase credited to my account. Furthermore, the manual said to press input selection and then press L1 on my television. The menu on my TV does not have L1. It had AV1 and AV2. But in any case, I could not get it work so I returned it for a full refund."
1,Help -- how to record?,"Has ANYONE figured out how to record from TV with this thing? We have tried every combination of cables with and without going through RF modulator. It plays videos or DVDs just fine but it's ridiculous to be unable to record TV shows. Wishing we'd read the reviews before ordering, but still thinking there must be a way and we just haven't figured it out yet. A clue, anybody?"
5,Great little worker,This was a gift for my 80 yr old grandmother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to use and a quality product.
1,Broke,"Randomly it stopped ejecting the DVD. Sometimes, if we leave a DVD in it, we are able to press ""play"" to make it register the DVD, and then it will eject to put in a new one. But most of the time we cannot use it except for VHS. We did nothing to the player to make it do this, so thats really annnoying. Dont waste your money, it will break!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!!,"Oh My WORD!!! This unit is GARBAGE!! DOA!!!We just received this unit yesterday from Sears andIt ate two video tapes. It shut off when we turned it on. It repeatedly ejected the tapes and made some weird noise{{UGGGH}}Now I have to pay to have it shipped back to Sears because there isn't a store in my area and customer service told me it would take WEEKS before they can have UPS come and pick the unit up!!At least if I would've purchased it from Amazon, it could've been easily returned at no cost to me.Like Judge Marilyn Milian loves to say 'The cheap comes out expensive'Don't be a sucker like me. AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,"Useless for anything but playback, no recording functions","I bought this unit, and it is only for playing DVDs and VCR tapes. Sure, it WILL record...but not in any useful manner.There is no internal tuner. What this means is that you have to provide a line in from your tv or another source like a cable box. It does not, as most VCRs do, take a coaxial cable.To record, you have to set the tv to the channel you want. You can't change the channel on the tv, or the vcr will record the new channel instead.Also, there's no timer in the VCR. So you literally have to be standing there ready to hit RECORD when the show starts.The whole reason I have a VCR so I don't HAVE to be there when the show is on.I immediately boxed it back up, and it's going back. I'm giving it two stars only because I assume the DVD player works fine. I never even turned it on, so I don't know."
1,Save your $$,"We mostly liked this product for the first 3 1/2 months -- which cooresponds to the length of time it worked for us. I see others have experienced Sylvania Sudden Death Syndrome even sooner than we did. For the sake of the environment, avoid this product. It will just take up landfill space.Now to see if we can get my son's brand new DVD (Christmas gift from Grandma) out of the piece of junk before we have its body committed."
3,NO SOUND ON VHS,Very nice machine except the sound does not work on VHS movies the instructions on setup were sketchy and vague and useless.doesn't work on some RCA TV sets. I was going to return but lost shipping number from AMAZON
4,DVD/VCR Combo player,"The machine works fine and has good picture and sound quality. My only beef with it is that it doesn't have a coaxial cable intake port. I must hook it up via the AV game ports, which means I have to go to my TV and change the function from TV to AV every time I want to use the player. My last player had the coaxial plug in and it was wired through my cable box, which meant I could use it with a couple pushes of my remote. It was much easier to use than this machine. I didn't see this in the specs before I purchased it. If I had I probably would have found a different product."
2,Got fooled again,"I really wanted a vhs dvd recorder at a low price. In my zeal to save, I guess I didn't check carefully enough to see if this could do what I wanted. It's (for me) a player only. The dvd section looks and sounds pretty good. However, the vhs side is barely adequate because it doesn't see the hifi tracks at all, so what you hear is an attenuated mono audio track, when one is available, and absolutely none of the hifi stereo audio that may exist on the vhs recording. Sound is important to me, so I guess I'll use this to play cd's and movies on dvd. The vhs side may be good for cueing up tapes, and that's about all."
3,Caveat Emptor,"After reading the existing reviews I went ahead and purchased this unit to replace the one that died. Within the first five minutes it locked up on the DVD mode. And the little red ""timed recording"" light kept flashing. I had not been fooling with that feature. Turning the unit on and off did not clear it, nor did unplugging for more than one minute. I did get it to work again by manually rapidly cycling the on/off button and the VCR/DVD button. The unit is for my 90yr old mother and she doesn't want anything to do with DVDs so I asked her to just not go there. Hopefully the condition won't recur."
2,Is this my fault?,"So I go online to buy a dvd player and vcr player and find a great deal on Amazon.com. I buy it, receive it in a timely manner and come to find out the vcr part is just a recording device not a player. Who would have thought! Who just records? What would you do with it once you are done if you can't play it back? Of course I threw out all of the info. for sending it back. Now what to do! and I still have a giant bin of VHS tapes that I can't watch."
3,Good Product,In order to record a television program and you have cable tv you need a converter box. :(
1,Not what I wanted,"I wanted a DVD/VCR combo that recorded from my TV and did not need a tuner. This item did NOT have a tuner and therefore I can not record directly from my TV (as I have been able to do with other combos). To me the description implied I would be able to do this.I have sent an email to the distributor and have heard nothing back. Not a happy camper - I imagine at best I'll be able to get my money back but will have to pay postage both ways. At worst, I'll be stuck with something I don't want and out all the money."
3,Review,I was disappointed to see the unit didn't have a TV component to it. This was one of my main reasons for purchasing the unit. It'll be kind of hard to DVR a TV program when they are running on different wires. I think the advertisement could have been clearer on that point for non techno savey customers. Thank goodness we can catch missed programming on line now.
4,unhappy customer,the product is fine now that I finally have what I ordered.The company I purchased it from leaves a lot to be desired(Electronic Express)They sent the wrong product and then I had to spend $7.00 from my fixed income to return their mistake.Not happy..
1,The disapointment,"Sorry to say: I am very disappointed with this unit. It failed right after I connected it to my TV. The first tape I inserted to play stopped and ejected half way and nothing will keep it, or any other tape in the player."
5,DVD/VHS player,"Gave as a gift to my daughter for Christmas, so far everything has worked fine and no complaints......Good deal for the price"
5,DVD/VCR combo:Sylvania DV220SOSL8,Amazon features this incredibly affordable and silver slick combo. It takes little space and serves us very well. I have told friends about this one.
1,VHS player produced unwatchable picture.,"Even with the tracking adjustment, the tapeplayer wouldn't produce a sharp picture. The best I could do on picture quality was still unwatchable."
2,WILL NOT RECORD,"I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT AND NOWHERE DID IT SAY 'won't record"" WITHOUT BUYING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS. THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT HAVE A TUNER!! WHY WOULD ANYONE ORDER THIS PRODUCT? I AM IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO RETURN THE PRODUCT TO AMAZON. I THINK THIS WILL BE MY LAST ELECTRONIC ITEM ORDER ON LINE UNLESS IT CAN BE RETURNED TO A NEARBY STORE OR SEE THE PRODUCT FRONT AND BACK AND GIVEN COMPLETE INFO. I AM JUST SICK ABOUT ORDERING TWO OF THESE. I THREW THE BOX AWAY BEFORE INSTALLING THE FIRST ONE AND CAN NOT RETURN IT.SHAME ON YOU-AMAZON FOR NOT PROVIDING THE CORRECT INFO ABOUT THE THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL ITEMS FROM YOU AND THIS IS A BAD PUBLIC RELATIONS FOR YOU."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I purchased the DVD/VCR combo to consolidate my Audio/Video equipment.. Unfortunately this VCR didn't have an internal tuner, so to record video from TV, I needed to run a mess of AV wires to make that happen, no mention of it when I purhcased it, but I guess it will have to do! Nice product, a bit of a pain in the butt to set up, but overall, a nice DVD/VCR combo"
1,As cheap as it's price,"Bought this VCR/DVD combo at deep discount so I wasn't expecting much. So, I wasn't surprised when I found out there was no antenna connection. Had to hook up an RF Modulator (and before this, I had no idea what an RF Modulator was - so, I guess I did learn something). Then, after two months of use, the DVD player gave up the ghost. Nothing. I had to take the unit apart just to retrieve my DVD.If you're looking for a cheap, short term solution until you get something nicer, then this is your unit. If you want to impress your friends by using the term RF Modulator at your next party, this is your unit. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,Piece of Junk,"This product stopped working after only four months of use. I tried to get help from the manufacturer, but my time on the phone with them was a waste. I returned it to Amazon and was surprised to receive a partial refund, even though the return period had expired."
2,No Sound on VHS,"I purchased this unit to play DVD's and old VHS tapes. The DVD player is fine, and I like it. However, right out of the box, the sound doesn't work on the VHS side, so I can watch, but not listen - not very useful. Not really worth the aggravation and shipping cost to send it back, but now I'll need to get another machine. I really want to put those VHS tapes onto disc and I'll need the sound to work."
1,Waste Money,I bought this item on January 2011 and used VCR player only once.It was videos from family recorded on 1998 and it broke when playing the second video. To get the VCR back I had to open the entire player and manually remove VCR from player system. Player started to make a loud noise from broken plastic gears and quit running. The DVD system still working but the VCR system is gone. Not only that but the DVD system play only zone 1. As I have few DVDs from zone 2 I am not able to play them. I suggest not to waste your money in this item.
2,Good for DVD but don't bother with vhs,"This DVD/VHS combo player might as well just be a DVD player alone. I bought it new and have used it several times for both. DVDs seem to play fine but so far it's almost ruined two VHS tapes. They play fine too, but when I hit stop the tape would get tangled up inside the player. I had to take the plastic cover off the top to untangle the tape and get the cassettes out. Luckily the tape in each case was only left with wrinkles in certain spots that distort the picture and sound, but it could easily have been torn. A new VHS player is not supposed to do that, needless to say. I don't think this is just a defect in my player because it doesn't do this to all tapes, its only been older ones (which, although old, were in perfect condition and did not have that problem in other VHS players). Like I said, DVDs play fine but you are taking a gamble putting a VHS cassette inside this thing."
1,Six Wars?,"His ""wars"" were a little over the top for me. A ""soldier"" in six wars? Too much of a stretch. His personal count of being a soldier in six wars, is a slap in the face of real combat soldiers, in real wars. Another ""I love me book"" with the usual embellishments. The book title is misleading, especially to civilians who don't know better. The author needs to keep a low profile on his exploits of a ""Six War Veteran"" especially when dealing with fellow ""Green Berets."""
5,An exciting good read,"Sasser successfully completed Special Forces training and won his ""green beanie"" at a time when it was a truely difficult accomplishment. This is a ""There I Was"" story by someone who really was there. Sasser has the ability to immediately capture the reader's attention and hold it to the end. It is often difficult to find a place to stop reading and rest your eyes because you really want to see what's coming next. This is an excellent read about an exciting life lived with a capital L."
5,Horribly sad..,"This book is heartbreaking to read. It disgusts me to read about so called Americans, who treated our soldiers like scum.While some of the stories shared were heartwarming, the negative treatment that many of the soldiers endured, overshadowed the positive stories.I read this book a long time ago, and recalling some of the stories still brings me to tears. This book is a must read.To our Vietnam veterans, may God bless you.To the maggots who spat on our soldiers.. may you rot in Hell."
5,Cute Book,"I got this book for my dad for Christmas, he is a train lover and I thought this would be a cute Christmas gift. The book contains a lot of interesting graphics and stories that relate to that era. With the stories and pictures my dad got re-live some of his past Christmas experiences and memories and it made me think about how the celebration of Christmas has changed a little since then."
5,Perfect for my religion senior thesis,"Oh, I loved this book! Rarely do I play guessing games with books (purchasing a book that I have a faint clue will be of some help)...but I had an inkling this book would be perfect as subject matter #4 for my senior thesis on how famous Middle Eastern mystics of Turkey and Persia viewed God and faith. I took a chance, bought the book, and could not have been more satisfied. *****!! <If anyone would like to know the other books I chose for my thesis, I would be happy to let them know>"
5,I have a celebrity crush on Hafiz!,"Hafiz's poems are deeply passionate and always inspirational. I teach massage therapy in Austin and we have elevated him to honorary faculty because he is the most quoted author by all the instructors at any school function where one of us may be required to say a few words. I can never make it through this book without weeping tears of joy. Hafiz is a master of the Art of Joy. Through his loving instruction, you can see the loveliness of even the darkest night of your soul. With a voice steady enough to whisper to us over 800 years, the light of his spirit is a beacon to seekers everywhere. He's dreamy!"
1,Beware of picture and description not being what gets sent,"I needed an XD card that is NOT M or H type, because my camera unfortunately does not accept the newer cards. I found this and ordered, but was sent an M type, even though the picture and description are not M type. The vendor refunded my purchase price but not the return shipping as promised."
5,Worked as predicted,Got exactly what one would expect from Olympus. The quality of their products has always been fantastic with me.
1,"Wrong memory card shipped, returned, lost out on shipping","There was no indication that this was an upgraded memory chip that I was ordering. It would not work in my camera. When I received it the supplier did agree to take it back, but under the terms of Amazon and the supplier, the shipping charges were non-refundable. Last time I place an order like this. I had to pay shipping charges both ways which made the refund only worth about $5 after I deducted the shipping charges which were $26."
2,My copy might have BEEN a copy...,"I enjoyed seeing this when I first got it, but upon reviewing it again this past year, the DVDs won't play. They seem to be bad copies or just DVD-R copies that tend to lose their storage retrieval. I would caution anyone buying this, especially if it's USED that it might not be a professional DVD. I'm not sure. I know I'm not happy because it doesn't play now."
3,"We enjoyed the book, but.....","Ms. Fritz, your bias is showing! I had to edit and editorialize as I read this to my children to correct numerous misstatements and oversimplifications regarding Christianity. For example, Christians were not opposed to scholarship ~ it's largely because of Catholic and Byzantine monks that Greek and Roman literature was preserved.Furthermore, I've come to think of Jean Fritz as the queen of the sentence fragment. I personally find bad grammar distracting when I'm reading."
1,Two thumbs down...,"I was so looking forward to digging into this book with my kids, so we could ""explore"" the age of exploration. We have enjoyed many of the books by Jean Fritz, especially those written about Colonial and Revolutionary America, but this one should not be included in that list.Ms. Fritz has an apparent personal dislike for certain groups of people and makes her dislike abundantly clear throughout the work. Unfortunately, this bigoted approach leaves such a bad taste in the reader's mouth that the entire story becomes unpalatable. The worst result of this approach is that Ms. Fritz has decided to rewrite history based on her own personal opinion instead of actual fact. This is a NON-FICTION book, so by inserting fiction into the equation, she has destroyed the trust that a reader should have in an author.All in all, I was sadly disappointed and will definitely question reading more of this author's work in the future."
2,Humorous but inaccurate,"The inaccuracies which plague this book are many. The author has allowed a vitriolic personal bias against Christianity to take the place of historical accuracy. In addition to the stunning inaccuracies, the venomous, contemptuous tone of every reference to the Christian faith is problematic. In this day of tolerance, it is surprising that anyone would allow their personal prejudices to be so visible and so hateful, especially in a book for children! In a book which is supposedly based upon history, it is surprising that anyone would print out-and-out lies such as are found in this book. Why did I give it two stars? Because the text, when it is not too busy attacking the author's imaginary archenemy, is refreshing and useful. It is humorous, winsomely written, and fun. The illustrations are great, too. It's sad that the author's personal biases have marred this otherwise fine work."
2,What happened to Jean Fritz?,"I rely on Jean Fritz -- I like her style from little-kid biographies (And then what happened, Paul Revere?) to big-kid biographies (Why Not, Lafayeete? or Where Do You Think You're Going, Christopher Columbus?)I was tremendously excited to read this book, but what a disappointment. Jean Fritz often has an undertone of irony in her books (which we applaud *and* enjoy), but this book is sarcasm-unleashed.The tone of the book is unpleasantly snarky. It is inappropriate for my kids... I wanted an instructive and entertaining book, not a soliloquy founded on Jean Fritz's simmering hostility to Western civilization. Only the excellent illustrations save it from a one-star rating.Instead of this book, try Marc Aronson's book ""The World Made New.""The World Made New: Why the Age of Exploration Happened and How It Changed the World (Timelines of American History)"
3,"Good, but...","This book is humorous and includes, in my opinion, appropriate treatment of some negative aspects of the explorers (such as the slave trade). However, I have found subtle bias which may offend some Christians. The burning of the library at Alexandria is blamed on Christians, although this is not conclusively proven. Fritz writes ""Christians did not believe in scholarship. They thought it was sacrilegious to be curious."" This is a gross overstatement at best. In listing people and things sent with Columbus to the New World on a second trip, Fritz groups ""six priests... in addition to fifty horses and a pack of dogs trained to attack hostile natives if necessary."" Interesting that priests are listed with horses and attack dogs. Aside from these kinds of things, the book is interesting. I intend to ""edit"" when and if I read this to my children."
1,Homeschoolers beware,"I have never come across such blatant hostility towards Christianity - and in a children's book to boot! The research is inaccurate and the writing poor. For example, the author writes about Prince Henry, ""He was religious enough...."" and then continues on to, yet again, put Christians in a tiny, mindless box. What does it mean to be ""religious enough""? Don't make the same mistake I did by buying this book."
1,Anti-Catholic,I haven't read more than a couple chapters but what i did read was too anti-catholic for me. We scrapped the book. Wish I hadn't wasted my money on that one!
3,"He's better as a conductor. Much, much better....","Rene Jacobs was part of the second generation of modern countertenors, after Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin . This recording shows how much the technique of falsetto singing has improved over the years. There is no comparison possible with someone like Andreas Scholl, for example. Jacobs values honest musical values over showmanship, and there would not be a problem with that except for the fact that Baroque opera was all about showmanship of the very highest order. No matter, Rene Jacobs has gone on to better things, like becoming possibly the greatest conductor of Baroque vocal music in the world, along with his fellow Belgian Phillippe Herreweghe. That said, this is still a valuable recording because of the selection from Handel's ""Admeto"" which is awaiting an up-to-date recording. ""Admeto"" was the last Handel opera to be performed before this repertoire vanished from sight for 165 years."
4,Exactly what is says,"It doesn't have IPA pronunciations, which is frustrating. It comes in handy anyway, especially for the Singing In Russian class I'm taking."
2,Best if you already know the Russian alphabet,"I had to return this because it did me no good without having knowledge of the Russian alphabet. Maybe when I'm more advanced I would find it helpful. Langenscheidt's language books are normally very good and I'm sure this is too, but I was just not ready for it."
2,Get twice the value at half the price...but not buying this.,"This is certainly a simple and fun instrument, but because of its simplicity the number of patches (voices) and the few knobs on the instrument, programming this beast is extremely complicated.The default voices on the Alesis Micron are hollow, so to speak. Once again, for the simple sounds and effects that it gives you, go with a software instrument.-On the plus side: (why I bought it)+Incredible [but limited] drum voices. If only I could program the machine without having to scroll through a dozen menus on a tiny screen.+Fun Sounds (but on the cheesy side)+Easy (to use default voices and make minor edits)"
1,Simply didn't work,"I'm hardly a yo yo pro, but I could definitely throw out some decent tricks back in the day! 'Santa' put this in my 9 year old's stocking and after watching him 1) try to wind it for 5 minutes, and 2) try to get it to come back up to his hand, I finally had to intervene. Uh... yeah, it didn't work. AT ALL. I got it to come back up once or twice, but for the most part you just throw it out and it stays out, then endlessly spins like the string was wound/twisted up. Ok... so I straightened the string until the yo yo hung perfectly straight, wound it up perfectly, threw it out for a prefect watch-how-the-pros-do-it moment, and... nothing. Frustrating for all, total waste of money. Will tryYomega Power Brain XP Wing Colors May Varyand see if we have better luck."
3,Good,"Es un yoyo basico, de facil uso, es para novatos, pero si lo quieres es jugar con el de manera normal es perfecto"
4,For my grandchildren,"i bought these for my grandchildren. they are still very young and really haven't got the hang of it yet. when they see me play with the yo-yo, they have to get in on it. it does take coordination, which they don't have yet. it will come..."
5,Joshua's Review of the Duncan Imperial Yo-Yo,"The Duncan Imperial Yo-Yo has been around forever. Each one is solid, darn near unbreakable, and of course small enough to take anywhere (like most yo-yo's). The string that comes with the yo-yo is durable and wound tightly,loosely enough to let the yo-yo sleep right out of the package and come back up. I've bought a few different yo-yo's over the years and this brand/model is my personal favorite. As far as educational value, the yo-yo is a study of friction, conservation of energy, change of momentum, and is a great exerciser of coordination, and the Duncan Imperial is in my esteem perfection for this type of toy."
2,Imperial Difficult for kids to use,"My kids found it harder to use than, say, the butterfly yo-yo made by Duncan."
2,Falls flat..,"I bought this YoYo for my 8 year for Christmas and was quite disappointed with the overall performance. I ordered based on reviews and Duncan's quality reputation, however this YoYo falls flat of great fun. It doesn't bounce back. When yanked or rolled down, it just stays unrolled. Unlike any YoYo I've ever played with. It may be defective and I'm considering returning it. My 8 year old doesn't play with it and called it broke. I call it a waste of money."
2,Pretty but faulty,"I bought this timer because it had three sand glasses with different time intervals (3, 4, and 5 minute) and as they were multicolored, it was also visually appealing. It is well constructed with the metal parts appearing to be stainless steel. Unfortunately, two of the glasses have a habit of clogging and if the sand stops flowing before all of it has gone through it's not very effective when cooking eggs. I'd like to return it but with the supplier located in Canada, is it worth the trouble? If I wasn't retired I'd probably have it on my desk at work to act as a conversation starter."
5,Quality that works.,I use it when I want to time things from 3 to 5 min. More enjoyable than just a timer.
3,"Good, but not Great","This is a visually appealling timer that we use for french pressed coffee: (3 minutes -mild, 4 minutes - medium, and 5 minutes - bold brew.) The concept is great, but the design is not sturdy at all, and breaks easily. Also, the times are not precise, which is ok for coffee, but probably not for some cooking applications."
5,"It's Sybervision, goofy","No offense to the previous reviewer, but this is a Sybervision tape, not an instructional tape -- there's never any narration with these. The whole point is that you watch the ""perfect"" motion over and over and thus develop muscle memory. Once you've seen this ten times, it does tax your sanity -- but the technique works. You basically watch Patty hit 50 drivers from a couple of angles, then 50 5-irons, etc. In lieu of narration, there is pleasant music which is supposed to enhance the muscle memory. Anyway, this is Patty's swing of 15 years ago, and it is FLAWLESS. I'm a 5-handicap male who has both this tape and the related one by Al Geiberger, and I ALWAYS watch this one."
1,Don't buy this New Age junk,"I thought this was an instructional video on the golf swing. Instead, Sheehan over and over and over and over again swings at the ball, New Age music plays, and you are supposed to absorb the correct golf swing by osmosis. Don't waste your money."
1,Most annoying video ever made!,This video will make you want to SCREAM. It's so annoying watching a 1980's Patty Sheehan hit a ball over and over to nausiating music. I found it useless in terms of golf instruction. Don't waste your money.
2,Incorrect review spoiled the sale.,"I wanted a wired remote for the Canon 7D that had a removable cable so that I could swap out cables on my wireless remote (it has a removable cable but you need different cables for different body models).One of the reviews said this one has a removable cable.It does not.It was returned to vendor.I wound up ordering the ""GSI Super Quality Luxury Remote Switch Trigger for Canon EOS 5D, 1D, 1D Mark II, 1DS, 1Ds Mark II, EOS 20D, EOS 3, D60, D30, 10D, EOS 1V, EOS D2000, 30D, 50D Cameras, Functions Exactly as the Canon RS-80N3"". It has a removable cable and is a much better quality unit as well. Ergonomic in your hand, better tactile response and better build. Also, you are not limited to the factory length - you can add whatever length of 1/8 mini plug cable you want. For my needs - just the cable - the remote itself is just a bonus! And a good one at that!Enjoy"
4,children's story,"Childs' story about an American Saddlebred mare. Lots of good drawings by Pers Crowell, in the Sam Savitt style (maybe not quite so good, but close)."
3,Frustrated with brand new camera,My daughter just received this for Christmas. My dh thinks we should exchange it already (two days later) because it keeps shutting off even with a fully charged battery. The battery compartment keeps popping open!
1,Nice looking and thats all,"When looking for a new camera to take pictures of my baby niece I was foolish enough to base a lot of it on the looks of this camera. It is slim and has its own rechargable battery which was great, but after 2 months of use, the camera just died. The screen got a black dot on it and the lens stuck in place. While it did work the pictures taken indoors were either grainy or mostly white and the camera would shut off on its own sometimes. My return went pretty smooth, but still a big disapointment."
4,Digi cam!,"Great camera takes beautiful landscape pictures! Not so great with lots of bright lights, but certain setting make it much better. video function is better than other camera i have had both picture and audio is clear. bargain buy, and its small enough to fit in any bag/ pocket!"
5,Charming historical insight,"I picked up this book while in NYC because I was looking for a gift for a friend back in Seattle. The flyleaf got me hooked. The author spins a delightful tale that skillfully illuminates an era (almost 200 years ago) when hoaxes were regularly promoted in ""the press"" and which gives meaning to the admonition of ""let the buyer beware!"" The hoax which is at the heart of the book is placed in realistic historical context.Highly recommended for anyone interested in historical NY as well as those of us who think we're not interested in history. A very good tale well told."
3,Short and somewhat interesting,"While I found some of the material in this book interesting, in the end, I was quite disappointed. The story is about a hoax that was purported to have occurred in the 1800's. In 150 pages of prose, the author describes the hoax and many anecdotes regarding the period. However, the final chapter lays out the case that the hoax probably never occurred in the first place - the hoax was a hoax. Since I probably would never have read the book knowing this, I felt I had wasted my time. On the positive side, the book was received as a gift, it's a short read, and I was able to learn a few things about the period. I would buy this book only if you have absolutely nothing else to read."
2,Too technical.,The book was for my husband and he says it was too technical for him. It wasn't written for the common person. May be a really good book for professional people but not for him. Thank you.
5,A book for the true space junkie.,"Do you wonder how they did it? How they actually figured out how to get to the moon? Well, this is Von Braun's plan for getting to mars using the technologies available in the early 1950's and it shows the detailed thinking necessary to figure out how to make it all work. Lots of math and diagrams. My vote for the best book of the century. To give you some idea, I already own this book, a 1962 edition. It is getting too precious to thumb through."
2,It is rocket science,"I found this book in a search that was filtered for science fiction, and I didn't see anything in skimming the reviews that made me think otherwise. Please be warned: this is not fiction. It has no characters or plot. It is a rocket science textbook packed with equations and technical diagrams. If that's what you're looking for, you're in luck!"
4,Wonderful read.,"I read this book in the 1980s and 1990s. It took me 10 years to read - on and off. The shortest read time that I am aware of is 4 years. Nonetheless, if you are interested in math, and want to see how Godel's incompleteness theorem relates to art and music, this is the book for you. Wonderful philosophical treatises, arts and interactions."
1,All hype and no substance,This book is probably the primary way that the public learns about some of Gödel's ideas. That is has to be in such a naive misrepresentation is typical of the way that Gödel's entire life of thought and work has pretty much been completely missed by the public and even by academia.This works is really a waste of time...go read some of Gödel's papers or books by Hao Wang. This book does make a great gift to your friend who has no interest in reality but loves smart looking books on his/her shelf though so it's not completely without merit.
2,Extremely boring,The only thing I liked about this overwhelmingly overrated book were Escher's drawings. The rest is a bunch of pseudo-Zen bullcrap that I wish I never read.
2,creative as a robot,"I really got bored by this one. If you don't like repetitive patterns (Escher & Bach) you may also.Someone wrote elsewhere it is a book for teenager.Well, it may seem scornful, but it seems to me the best punch line for this.It is a book by someone a little preposterous, who thinks that everyone should like what he likes, and a little fanatic about it.The cover image say it all.If you find this sculpture which can be a ""G"" a ""B"" or a ""E"" depending on how you see it something worth to be a cover for a book speaking of arguably three great minds of humanity , then you are ready for hofstadter show off"
1,A mishmash of unrelated ideas. A waste of time.,"I read this book I don't remember how many years back. I think about 15 years ago. And just remembering makes me nauseous, for the amount of time and effort it took me read it just to get to no point. I was younger, naiver and I got engaged, I confess that. Clever Author no doubt, to make a huge pile of unrelated ideas and make believe you would get somewhere following his lead. Just wandering around and playing with analogies. I had the time back then, I guess. Today I only have the time to write a review stating how surprised I am today I could finish this kind of book. I can't speak for anyone else, suffice to say I was a nerd with a lot of time in my hands."
2,"Wish it was available for Kindle, so I could have sampled and not bought it","The author is crazy, the book is full of itself.If a smarter person can understand it, then bless 'em.I, for one, have more useful things to read."
4,Very good book but a bit wordy,"I admire what hofstader has to say in GEB, but think he often becoms wrapped up in his own ideas and rambles on for too long on a given subject. Nontheless, it is a well-written and insightful book. Well worth aread."
5,My brain melted,"When I got to the part where he fully explains the Incompleteness Theorem, my brain melted a little. You will learn many new concepts from this book even if you've been in the sciences for a long time. The mix of Achilles and Tortoise stories, the biography of Bach and the technical explanations of his compositions, communication theory, formal grammars, word play, Escher art... this book truly is ""an intellectual Grand Tour of hacker preoccupations"" as the Jargon File describes it! A must read for anyone interested in a layman's book on cognitive science and machine language. And did I mention it's FUN!"
2,A waste of time,"I gotta side with the minority here. That the book is omnipresent even after many years and has such a loyal following boggles my mind. I suppose the same people who get off on elaborate dungeons and dragons fantasies played over months and years would enjoy this. I did not. It is over-complicated, trite and sometimes positively obnoxious in its desire to be cute. If Hofstadter's desire was to write a nonfiction ""Finnegan's Wake,"" he's succeeded, but without the artistic accomplishment, only the chaos. If ever there were a case of the ""emporer's new clothes,"" this book is it. As a mathematician and attorney, I object to this kind of obsfucation."
1,Pseudo-science at best,"I quite agree with the reviewer from East Hartford. Maybe I am not extremely eligible to comment on the portions dealing with Escher and Bach, respectively (I have no appetite for Escher. I like chamber music of Bach and somtimes play his keyboard music but my performance level is, of course, that of amateur.)But I must say the part dealing with Gödel's Theorem of Incompleteness is *complete garbage*. I am convinced anyone with a degree of mathematics will agree with me: for those who have no background in mathematics, I assure you that Gödel's theorem concerns a problem in ""formal logic"" and has nothing to do with human-cogno-something.If this book were meant to be a cult literature, that would be okay: I don't care anyway.But if this is meant to be an entertainment for people with no scientific background, I rate this alchemy or pseudo-science at best."
3,"Dilettantish, but may be good for teenagers","I would certainly have been facinated by this book if I had read it soon after it appeared but not 20 years later. There is a lot inside to stimulate the imagination of a teenager. Unfortunately, for anyone with a formal education in some of the subjects touched upon, it is too clear that the work was written by a passionate dilettante."
4,This guy thinks he's so clever,"Yeah - this is an interesting read, and well worth picking up. The content is naturally very complicated, centering on self-referencing systems and other mathematical mind-twisters, and I think the author's pompous approach of playing with those notions in his presentation of the ideas does less to illustrate the points than it does to confuse readers. If you have the patience to sit through a conversation with a serious mathematician with a penchat for puns, you'll gain some interesting new perspective from this one."
4,Not Sure I'll Get Through It,"I spent a good part of the day yesterday beggining a reading of GEB and was fascinated at the way Hofstadter looked at language and Bach's canons and fugues. And there is much to come, I can tell. Although I consider myself an intellectual, I am not qualified enough in mathematics to really understand what is being said on the subject, but hope that Hofstedter is going to open that up for me, too."
3,Techno-nerd wet dreams,"""The Eternal Golden Braid"" is apt to inspire wet dreams in adolescent techno-nerds with little exposure to fiction or philosophy. Very clever it is; great literature it ain't. I've owned a copy for about 15 years and keep it for a curiosity and as a glimpse of the profound ideas whose surface it scratches. But I blushed reading that some of the other reviewers think Hofstadter reinvented the book. What he did was borrow a little from the three title characters, plus a lot more from Lewis Carroll."
1,It doesn't work for me,"I found this book to be too distracted to be good science, too unpersuasive to be good philosophy, too cute to be good math, and too annoying to be good poetry. With no disdain or contempt for the many people and prize committees who have found their lives or minds enriched by this book I have to say I found nothing here that helped me."
2,A pretty good biography of Douglas R. Hofstadter,"If you want to learn about the author, Douglas R. Hofstadter, and to marvel about how talented and witty he is, this is a very decent book.However, if you want to understand the connection between recursion and consciousness, about what Godel, Escher and Bach have to do with it, and about how the human mind is like a computer, this book is nearly unreadable.The author really has a habit of writing in length about himself, usually in a way only remotely connected to anything relevant to you, the reader. I found myself constantly reading things that really don't interest me much about the author, only to get to the main point, which could otherwise have been stated in one eighth as much text.I have stopped reading half-way through the book. The ideas presented may be revolutionary and exciting, but I personally find it unreadable."
5,The most intellectually beautiful book there is- really!,"This book is written for absolutely everyone. I speak as a high schooler when I say that it can be enjoyed at any age- even children could enjoy Hofstadter's ""Achilles and Tortoise"" dialogues on a literary level. But for anyone interested in both music and the sciences, Godel, Escher, Bach is a profound journey through all realms of knowledge that entices the reader with discussions on everything from Zen Buddhism to molecular biology.What may seem like a digression is then woven back into this ""eternal golden braid."" Amusing metaphors alternate with chapters on artificial intelligence and how self-reference can either lead to self-destruction or ""self-creation"" in a sense. In conlcusion, Godel, Escher, Bach is something that everyone should just RUN to buy!!"
3,A clever approach to a scholarly subject,"Anyone interested in the subject of artificial intelligence should consider tackling the challenge of reading this book. It is wide-ranging, often clever and entertaining, sometimes difficult, and very, very long. I am neither a scientist, nor a mathemetician, and struggled with portions of the book, but I found the dialouges in between the chapters to be remarkably clever."
4,"A very useful introduction to the received edition, especially concerning book's translation ""adventures"" in French...","A very useful introduction to the received edition, especially concerning book's translation ""adventures"" in French. A well written and illustrated book, focused on an interesting insight into self and conciousness."
5,buy this book. buy ten. tell your friends.,probably the greatest book i've ever read. 700+ pages of pure genius
2,What is it?,"I read this book several years ago, and again recently. I did not find it the masterpiece that it is touted to be. The explication of the Incompleteness Theorems, unlike Gödel's paper, is very mystifying. Most of the reviewers, while awarding many stars to this book, admit their own mystification, and, surprisingly, cite this as rationale for the book's depth! If you really want to understand the Incompleteness phenomenon in arithmetic, and how it is tied to recursive axiomatizability, look elsewhere. Most textbooks on mathematical logic are better, and less pendantic.On the other hand, I did not dislike the book. It reminds one of the kind of discourse that occurs when the acid is mellow and infused with some speed. Interesting, but without many ramifications for real life. And there are many, many other books of greater charm and import, that will never come close to obtaining the Pulitzer."
5,This book influenced my personality,"I was 16 when this book first came out. I read bits and pieces of it constantly from that time until I finally read the whole book from beginning to end when I was 37. By then I had read the whole book several times over, but never sequentially. Many of my personality traits can be traced back to this book: a love of Lewis Carroll, my career as a computer programmer, my interest in robotics and artificial intelligence, and several Bach CD's in my collection (including the Musical Offering). I love this book. I'll leave it next to my son's bed when he's old enough to start understanding it."
5,For those who think and have fun with it,"This book is full of ideas that walk into your mind and startredecorating it--Picasso-style. Some of the greatest ideas thathumankind have ever had are collected and connected in this book.Hofstadter loves a good pun, and this book is filled with them.Recommended for logic fans--those who answere either/or questionswith ""Yes."""
4,Interesting,"Not much to add to what has already been said about Hofstadter's classic. GEB is well thought out and deftly presented. As a non-mathematician, however, some of the logic descriptions sent me running for my references (not all a bad thing). His use of the Lewis Carroll's Tortoise and Achilles is brilliant, and truly made some of the more difficult passages accessible. I'm not sure how much has been overtaken by time and technology, but I sense parts that could use an update. The introduction to the anniversary edition was helpful and enlightening.Recommended."
4,"good, but too long","Don't buy into the wild hype surrounding this book that many of these reviews spout. No this in NOT the greatest book ever written. However, it is a pretty good ""soft"" introduction to many interesting areas of mathematics and computer science. In particular, this book covers mathematical logic, Godel's Theorems, the theory of computation, and artificial intelligence. The major flaw with this book is its length. Hofstadter is a very longwinded writer, and much of this book could be considerably shortened without losing much. In spite of this, I heartily recommend this book. It is the best introduction to Godel's theorems and computation that I know of. In addition, the whimsical dialogs are an excellent exploration of form and content, just beautiful."
5,It hurts my brain!,"This book is so, so excellent. It's good for you, because by making you feel ignorant and stupid, it keeps you humble. It tired out my brain quite quickly, not because it was hard to read, but because the content makes you think! I really recommend this book. It's about (I know what it's about because for this 20th anniversary addition, DH writes an intro explaining what it's about) how self-referencial systems behave, including the human brain. But of course, there are massive digressions. DH is playing with you in places, just for fun. I really like the sharpness of this, the cool logic of it, the playfulness, and of course the challenge! The other thing is that I never really appreciated Escher's art until I got my hands on this book."
5,A remarkable mind-boggling work !,"It's a classic book and it's becoming old. I've read it when I'm in High Scholl. After 20 years it is amazingly refreshing. But I think that some parts is becoming outdated ( However, a classic book never loses its charm). Being an unsual work, between Knuth's ""The Art of Computer Programming"" and Carl Sagan's ""Broca's Brain"", it's somewhat difficult to read. Written in a pre-internet (as we use today), it loses some appeal for the young ones ( except for the gifted ones). I hope that Mr. Hofstadter has some plans to update and refresh with new format, new insights and appeal to the young ones."
5,Great Book,"Intellectual, deep, and sometimes complicated but always worth your time if you like to think. Quite literary as well.A must read for all mathematical, rhetorical, or logic based thinkers."
5,Very Curious Are You?,"If you like genius. If you are interested in fractals, improbable harmonies, math recursion, puzzles, artistic illusionary impossibilities and strange loopy weirdness where life seems to look back at itself. Then this book is for you."
5,One of the best books ever written,"If you haven't read what some people consider the greatest book ever written, take the opportunity to buy your very own copy of the 20th anniversary edition of this Pulitzer-prize-winning classic of art, science and philosophy. It's difficult to imagine anyone reading this masterpiece and not becoming entranced by the beauty of science, the science of beauty, the Zen of illogic, the logic of Zen, and the mystical threads that weave together the life of even the most rational of skeptics. This is one of my favorite books of all time. To quote futurist and boy genius Eliezer Yudkowsky in his review of GEB: ""It is a terrible thing to contemplate that 150,000 people die every day without having read this book. Don't let it happen to you."".--Richard Brodie, author, Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme"

5,"Hard to understand, but Great to get insight!","Hard to understand, but Great to get insight!It's the best one of books what I've read."
1,Overrated. Trivializes and obscures some important ideas.,"This grossly overrated book has little to recommend it. Rather than clarifying the important ideas of Godel, Turing, and others, H makes them _harder_ to understand by embedding them in a hodge-podge of unfunny jokes, half-baked analogies, and bad writing"
2,"I want to like it, but I don't",It's inaccessible for those that don't know music theory and that was frustrating for me. The themes are fascinating and the sections on mathematics and art are wonderful.
1,Assembly Required,"It arrived with bad instructions - how on earth does one put a bolt into a small spring without tools and plenty of hand strength? A search of the Internet did not return any helpful hints, instructions, or videos. This leads me to think it should have come ready to put the two rods together. I have no idea how I'm going to use this - it's worthless to me."
4,I'm enjoying it,"It seems that people's reviews of the book reflect their own point of view. As someone with limited knowledge of this hstory, I appreciate that this book captures the flavor and complexity of those times. It's point of view ""rings true"" with other accounts of how Spanish society worked at that time. Another reviewer said that there were better books out there but didn't bother to mention any. Scholars and poli-sci majors may have criticisms of it, but I'm glad I bought it."
2,You can find better books on the American Southwest than this!,"The author seems more concerned with cramming as many Spanish names as he can into this book than with telling a coherent, engaging story about the Spanish conquest and settlement of the American Southwest. Tangents galore! One moment this group is settling Santa Fe and the next moment some bozo is inciting a rebellion! Sure, you'll glean some interesting knowledge if you read the whole book, but you're better off looking elsewhere if you're looking for an interesting read. I finished the book just to get my money's worth, nothing more."
4,"recommended, but always experiment on your own","This is a very good book on feng shui on giving practical advice. I will say, however, that this book is not comprehensive or complete in any way and that you will have to find ways to calculate flying stars in other books or websites. Nor do I agree with her 100% on every assessment she makes against other books or possibly other methods of feng shui (in particular the hong kong or pie chart method, IMO, is more accurate than the square method). This would be a good book to complement your feng shui book collection.It's too bad there aren't too many good books on purple star astrology which would really be good for feng shui knowledge seekers."
5,great service,I received this battery about 3 days after I ordered it. Great service. Great price. I highly recommend Amazon.com for your purchases.
1,Dead on Arrival Watch Battery ...,"Watchmaker offered to install a new battery into a used watch that had always worked perfectly until its battery died. Unfortunately, the so-called 'new' battery was just as dead as the original one--except that (to my knowledge, anyway...) it had never been used. For the price it cost me, it wasn't worth pursuing, leaving me with the feeling that I've been had. Very, very disappointed in this, one of my first purchases ever on Amazon.com. Is this typical? I'd have to think 'yes' unless I learn otherwise...."
1,Worthless,"If you want to learn how to dance, this video will be about as useful to you as a bicycle is to a fish. If you want to learn about the history of African dance and you want to look like an idiot, you'll love this tape."
1,the worst tape I've ever purcahsed,"This tape should be off the market. Period. Even the title is misleading. You learn nothing by watching this. It would have been better for me to have spent the money on something else. By the time I finished the tape, I was so frustrated--at myself for having bought it without having read any reviews and at MTV for putting out this garbage. I would have given it no star if I could have; giving it one star is actually very generous."
2,"Okay the first time, we had a few laughs","i bought this as a gift for my 9 and 12 year old daughters. The first time they ran through it we had a few good laughs at them trying to keep up. But, since then it has been a great dust collector. They have played it maybe 3 times in several months and no longer voice their urge to ""learn to dance"". I'm sure there are better ones out there than this video but it was okay for the price. If I could go back......I'd save my money."
4,Hilarious,"This one takes me back. I recall watching it on TV as a child. There's so little actually being done, it's no wonder they keep riffing on all the talking and plotting."
4,Sad Loss,"I bought my Dakota Hybrid watch one day while shopping in an Ann Arbor mall. At first I was skeptical about buying a watch that I had never before heard of and the fact that this was offered by an open-mall vendor added to my skepticism. But, overall, I have been more than happy with my watch.However, it recently quit working. I changed the battery and it started up again only to quit running the next day. I took the battery out and tried another one with the same results. So I took it to a jeweler in a city near me. He said the mechanism was dry and he cleaned and oiled it. I got it back, but after about a week it stopped working again. Now, after 5 years with my trusty Dakota Hybrid I am shopping again, unhappy that I lost the use of my watch."
4,I hate to say it...,"It pains me to agree with anything this conservative Reagan lackey has to say, but the fact is that when it comes to academics, something has gone well-intentioned but wrong on American campuses. As Harold Bloom has put it, people don't teach literature anymore, they teach ideologies. I don't like D'Souza's politics, but he does a good job here of skewering the opposite extreme which seems to have gotten the upper hand in turning colleges into travesties."
5,Campus Thought Police,"D'Souza discusses racist admissions policies, multiculturalism, racial professorial quotas, racial incidents, racial grading policies, and the racial and genderism across American university campuses. His writing pulls the reader into the controversies, and outrages the reader's sensibilities. His interviews with faculty and students facilitate the understanding into the prejudiced mind better than the studies of Allport and others. Schools are treating intellectual dissidents in much the same manner as the Soviet Union and China. Chinese and Soviet-like confessionals and trials are becoming the norm on campus: students must become politically correct not only in their behavior, but in the depths of their attitudes and minds. The end result of such mind control is merely a population that thinks of everyone in terms of race and sex.It's a reminder to us all. Lighten up! Get a life. Accept our differences."
1,A neo-racist tries to reopen a Pandora's box,"Combining a bad writing style with a penchant for self-righteousness, D'Souza comes across as the sort of guy who might serve as the ideologue for loony would be dictators.This book is bad enough, but D'Souza would get progressively worse in both writing style and sense of logic.You might wonder how anything written worse than this could even be published. But then bad books are the stock-in-trade of the conservative press."
3,good source of anecdotes and arguments,"So many years after this important book's initial publication, its arguments against affirmative action often sound crude and thin. The lasting value of it, though, is the abundance of anecdotal evidence that provides a look at some of the occasionally distasteful results of affirmative action. None of these taken individually, nor all of them collectively, are any compelling argument against affirmative action, but they do provide something that a.a.'s defenders must respond to. If, as D'Souza contends, our standards are slipping greatly as a result of multiculturalism, multiculturalists will have to tell us why their project offsets those losses. Some of the vignettes from modern academe are quite unsettling indeed, and no matter where we fall on the political spectrum, being unsettled will do us some good."
4,"Good, not great.","I believe this is the only official display stand on the market for the Yamato Macross figures. It comes with adapters for the various scales e.g. 1/48 & 1/60.In my opinion it's great for Gerwalk mode, but when it comes to the fighter mode it really detracts from the figure (this does not apply to the 1/60 scale). The ""clamp"" method used for this mode is very bulky & ugly, instead I recommend you look at the FlexiDisplay from Lost and Found Toys.To sum this up, fantastic for Gerwalk mode, terrible for fighter mode. And the chrome version is the pick of the two, it presents far more gracefully than the black version."
5,Exceptional,"It's very pleasing to buy a product that actually works as well as expected. Works well in both my vehicles. I have been thinking about adding a new radio/player to my boat but marine units are expensive. Thanks to the SAN-360, I now have an MP3 player on my boat as well!"
4,Works like it should but not worth the higher price point!,"This transmitter works like it should but I don't think it works any better than the lower priced Griffin itrip or any of the other options available for the Sansa Players*.Positives:1. It dose look cooler than the other ones and the matching blue background screen color is a nice touch.2. 3 presets (other options also offer this).3. Mounts, rather than just hangs, as some others do.Cons:1. Expensive2. The quality of reception is no better than any other commercially available transmitter.The product works as it should and has some cool features but I don't think it's worth the extra money (in some instances double) then other options available on Amazon.* For best sound buy a stereo deck with a built in MP3 player option, there are many on the market priced near/under $100. The sound quality with a transmitter is just not enough to feel/enjoy the music IMO."
4,Quality Item at a reasonable price,I purchased the Maximo FM transmitter about a month ago and have used it frequently since that time. I am very pleased with it. It is very easy to use and works well.
4,Nice alternative,"Works great, it's a good alternative for those with no MP3 capability in their car. I use this on a Sansa e250."
2,Sometimes it works,"When it works, it's great. However, be prepared that sometimes you will have to fiddle around for quite awhile to find a setting on your radio tuner that is neither a radio station nor has too much static. Plus, even if you find a tuner setting that works, it may not continue to work. There seems to be variation based on time of day and also with how much concrete you are driving between (as in on the highway or through construction). So, it's nice when it works, but I find myself not wanting to bother with it. I think I'm going to look for another option."
3,"Acceptable product, but not outstanding","this is my first fm transmitter, so i don't know what to compare it to except my car cd player and fm radio. the problem i was afraid would plague the transmitter is certainly there: signal strength. it's been impossible for me to find a band that is isolated enough to avoid getting static at some point along my drive from work to home. i've found one that is ""close enough"" and i'm tired of fiddling with it. it also has sound quality issues. there is a particular frequency in the treble range that always sounds staticky. i'm not entirely sure this doesn't come from the sansa, but at least i never notice it w/ my earbuds. still, it works and provides me w/ a way to listen to my mp3s that i was missing before and my sansa is always charged, which was a problem for me before b/c i was too lazy to charge it often. for full disclosure, i have grado headphones at home and super.fi 5 earbuds on the go. my issues w/ sound quality may not apply to non-audiophiles."
1,FM transmitter,"I purchased this device to enable listening to my Sansa MP3 player inmy car. The first thing I noticed was that the volume on my radiohad to be increased to unusual levels. After a week of fiddling withdifferent frequency locations to attempt to find a clear signal, I hadfinally settled on a band that I thought would work. My first trip out of town disabused of this idea as the constant fizzing and static made listening impossible. After another week of meticulously going throughthe entire FM frequency spectrum (and another out of town excursion), I decided I had had enough and went and bought a wired connector that plays through the cassette port. The wired component only cost a thirdof what the Maximo cost and works flawlessly. The Maximo unit can still be used as a charger for the Sansa player while on trips."
1,It works.........,I am not sure how well though.I bought this as an after thought for my MP3 player. It works. There seems to be a lot of background noise. Sound volume levels change constantly. Product performance seems to be different in different vehicles.I have not compared the product to anything else so I don't know if it works better or worse to the competition.I did return the unit under warranty replacement and the company treated me well. Exchanging the product promptly and professionally.
2,Can't see,Can't read frequency readout when plugged in to the car jack. It is too low on the dashboard and the read out is right at the jack.
3,Limited frequencies?,"Product works ok, but still trying to find available freqencies w/o static or interference. This product does not cover the full FM dial."
3,"Its ok, not great. The cupholder unit from Mcally is the BEST!","Its ok. It isn't terribly strong. If you have a spot for it, the cupholder unit from McAlly is the absolute best one. It is strong enough to block out even local stations!"
5,Excellent Product,"Near perfect sound quality and easy to use. One tip for those having issues with radio station quality. I started the fm transmitter and radio on the lowest frequencies, increased each till I found a station that sounded good. To my surprise a station that has an existing signal worked the best.Overall all, very pleased and recommended."
2,FOR LOUD MUSIC ONLY,"I like this thing. It is easy to use and allows for instant upgrade to MP3 in my car. The downsides? There is always some level of static or other noise audible during quiet music. I don't notice it during loud music and the audio quality seems pretty good given my crappy little car stereo. The device is set on an unused radio channel. My 40 minute commute is through the suburbs. Under the circumstances, I was not expecting interference with the audio signal between the device and the radio. Second, the channel display on the transmitter is not visible when plugged into the lighter outlet. I have to bend way down to see it and cannot make adjustments while driving. Lastly, the device is bulky and interferes with the cup holder in my Honda Civic. If I had to do it over again, I would try another product."
4,Works good.,Pleased with how easy the product is to use. Still have some songs louder than others. I live in a small town and get plenty of choices for stations. It is a little tricky to find a station in a bigger city. Other than that it works fine.
3,"Works ok, but...","I was initially very happy with the unit. Like all FM transmitters for cars, it emits a fairly weak signal. I was able to find two open channels in my area, and with the mp3 player in the sun visor its works well. Two weeks after I started using it the left channel died. I use it for audio books while on my one-hour-each-way drive, so a single channel is still ok for me."
2,MP3 Transmitter,Maximo SAN-360 Car FM Transmitter & Charger For Sansa e200 c200 c100 MP3 PlayersThe Maximo SAN-360 transmits an large amount static on very station I tried to use as a carrier. Consider another option.
3,It's middle of the road,"Depending on what type of file you are listening to...i.e. quality recorded music, vs. downloaded speaking media, you have to turn the volume way up,and then you hear all the interferance from the car's electrical system. Low Kbps recorded media does not play well. The cord is quite long, the unit is bulky...but its a cheap alternative if you are waiting to upgrade to a sleeker system."
3,Too much interference in Metro Area,"I'm in a metropolitan area where there are basically no unused frequencies. I haven't been able to find a frequency that the Maximo will work on without interference. The vehicle is a GMC Jimmy with factory radio. The best result I can get is by picking a frequency that has a weak station on either side, but I still get interference during my 20 mile commute. If you are in a metro area, you probably will not be happy with the Maximo."
4,Does the Job Well,"The Maximo FM Transmitter does a fine job playing my MP3s over my car stereo. I have found that if I drape the cord with the player over the rearview mirror, the transmitter works nearly flawlessly. If I leave the cord of the transmitter coiled near the plug, I get lots of static and breakthroughs from other FM stations. Overall, I am happy with the purchase!"
3,Great Charger with Poor Transmitter in Urban Areas,"The Maximo FM Transmitter is useless in urban areas. In areas with few unused radio frequencies, the radio noise interferes with your personal broadcast. Even when driving through remote areas one must frequently change channels because an unused channel in one rural area is not necessarily an unused channel in another. This is a well-made product, and it functions wonderfully as a charger, but the transmitter feature is not powerful enough to drown out the radio broadcasts."
1,Mine is Junk,"Maximo SAN-360 Car FM Transmitter & Charger For Sansa e200 c200 c100 MP3 PlayersFirst I tried it on a low battery, since it is supposed to be a charger. Didn't work. I charged my battery, tried it again. It made my player shut off. Had to remove the battery to try it again. It blew the fuse. I'm sending it back before it ruins my 240C, which works very well without the transmitter."
4,Better then Expected,This transmitter worked geat right out of the box. Good reception and easy to use. No Problems.
4,Does the job,"Does the job of transmitting to the radio but just don't expect high fidelity. Instead, you'll get a decent representation; call it acceptable. If you're in your car a lot, it's better than getting burned out on radio. And the charger feature alone is probably worth it, although the $60 some dollars I paid is a lot for a charger."
3,Thought it would have better reception . . .,"I researched this purchase and through many reviews, chose this FM transmitter for my Sansa e280. First, I live in a metropolitan area where there must be a FM station every step up the dial, so finding a station that worked was difficult. I am a little disappointed in the static reception I get no matter what station I pick -- but it works nonetheless."
4,Maximo SAN-360 works well,"I have a Sansa e280 and was looking for a way to play MP3s in my car. Overall the unit works well. I live north of Boston and find that FM 88.5 works well for me in terms of interference. My only gripe (and this is probably either my lack of knowledge or a Sansa limitation) is that when my e280 powers up, it comes up at 50% volume. I can't adjust the volume with this unit connected so I plug in ear phones to adjust the volume all of the way up and then connect the unit. This is a pain. I believe I have the latest e280 firmware so I am not sure what is going on."
2,a whole lot of hassle,Has good quality sound when there is no interference. I found it a bit annoying to use. It doesn't go below 88.1- or at least I couldn't get mine to go lower. All the unused frequencies are in the lower ranges so it was hard to find one that wasn't used- the ones I were able to use would only work for a while and then would have static. It is hard to fiddle with while driving- the buttons are small and the thing that displays your frequency is hard to see when the sun is shining. Not that impressed.
5,Plaz-tastic,Out of the five archives on Plastic Man to date I like this one the best (but this is not to say the rest are bad 2-5 are mearly terrific while this one is Plaz-tastic).Jack Cole set out to just put some bread on the table but he ended up creating what I consider to be a dream on paper.In later volumes a fleet of ghost artists takes over the adventures of the stretchable sherlock with some pretty good results but this is Cole's finest hour.l
2,Bland Interpretations of Tenacious D,"I was really looking forward to hearing a Bluegrass Tribute to the hilarious originals, but was really disappointed in the lack of range of The Dust Bowl Cavaliers. Every song sounds pretty much the same, and while it was enough for a few chuckles, it doesn't have a lot of replay value to me. I will be turning back to Tenacious D themselves, or else be picking up a different tribute album in my collection (perhaps Me First and the Gimmie-Gimmies)."
4,A delicious book,"I am really enjoying reading this book. The informative passages preceeding each recipe give some insight into the origin of the recipe and alternative ways to prepare and serve. I usually put post-it notes on each page that holds a recipe I want to prepare, but this book is just packed with goodies so I won't bother with the post-its. I particularly liked the traditional French recipes. Also, I feel that the methods used are relatively simple and easy for the average cook to execute, which is a tribute not only to the quality of Boulud's ability as a chef but also as an author. A lot of chefs' cookbooks get knocked (and mostly justifiably so) for being too complicated or esoteric for the layperson to relate to and use, but this chef's cookbook is the delicious exception to the rule. I thoroughly recommend this book."
5,Millennium Dinner,"This fantastic book was given to me as a Christmas present from my husband. He had heard a review stating it was the book to have. I've have poured over this book for a week and made our millennium dinner from it - Clams Casino and Seafood Misto. Since we were unable to dine at his restaurant in NY, this was the next best thing! (I've made a list of the recipes that I have to try and I'm not a professional cook!)"
3,Review by a weekend cook,"Boulud's book looks and reads well (I have tried only one recipe), however, the recipe for lamp chops with pignoli and lemon instructs you to add the basil, although there is no basil listed in the ingredients. I trust the editing of the other recipes has been more careful."
1,It didn't meet expectations,"I tried to use this product to download my own DVD's to my iPod. It says that it can copy any movie. They didn't says that did not include copyrighted material. However, it failed to copy a noncopyrighted DVD that I made myself. Two thumbs down to this product. Why can you download your own CD's into iTunes but not your own movies? Bummer. I really didn't want to give this product any rating stars, but had to give it 1 in order to post this review."
2,A bed time story,"This book is definetly not useful for continuing to learn VB. I found it poorly written, boring, with various grammatical mistakes and vague examples that are not very practical."
2,Too easy and too little variation,"This would be a great game for a younger child. I would never call myself a gamer and I found this game very simple. I was able to beat every level in thirty minutes. There are three difficulty settings but there isn't very much difference between them. After you've beaten the levels and tournament, the game is quite boring. You don't advance to another level once you've beaten one."
2,fun before you beat it,This game is so fun before you beat it.The first 25 minutes of it is hard and fun.Then you beat the game and its too easy to beat it again.The records are stupid .Once you beat the level tounament you can't get a higher record and tounament is easy.
4,Surprising and fascinating fiction,"This was recommended to me by the staff of the local bookstore, and looked original, so I read it.An engaging novel, and one that I liked. It mixes a lightish story about an old father who marries a gold-digger with the bittersweet relations between two sisters and the deadly serious history of their family back in Eurasia in the past.Much of the action rings trues and surprised me, even the tractor history, which parallels the action for little apparent reason. The story is entirely original, nothing like any other book that comes to mind. The old man turns out particularly complex and sympathetic, and no one was simplistically good or bad.There was a little too much Ukrainian lore for my tastes - cooking, culture, history, but I suspect many would find the mix just right."
3,Supposed to be funny,"My wife was laughing hysterically during her read of this book. I was expected much the same but I found the book, while well written, sad. There were a few cute moments but in my view, the book disappointed as an opportunity for a good belly laugh."
1,Over-hyped badly written sitcom plot,"Why is it that everyone raves about this novel? Is it the exoticism of Ukrainian lifestyle and manners that tickles people? It is, quite simply, a badly written book which isn't particularly interesting. More like a poor script for a daytime sitcom. So if you like that kind of thing, by all means buy. If you're looking for a good novel - avoid."
1,The tractor history is the most interesting part,"Plot outline suggests an interesting narrative, but does not live up to this promise. Limited character development, obviously hyped up."
2,Should I check my sense of humor?,"On the front page The Times is quoted to have written: ""Extremely funny!"".I didn't have one laugh. Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression."
1,not at all funny,I wonder why this book is such a success. I find it poorly written and not funny at all. The title is eccentric and totally misleading.
3,Review,"I enjoyed this book - it was very different with the story being held together by the history of tractors and yet the main themes included troubled family relationships; seeing an elderly parent as an individual, a sexual being and not just a parent and reacting to his exploitation. it was a worthwhile read."
4,Humourous read ...,"I enjoyed this read. The author made me care for the old fella in the book and I could relate very much to the tensions, greed and avarice between his children... I'd look for other books by the author again..."
3,"'good news Nadezhda, I'm getting married'","Moderately entertaining novel, however it certainly isn't extremely funny' as the cover blurb states. Actually it is quite a sad tale of an elderly widower trying to get one more chance of happiness by an entering an ill-advised marriage with a pneumatic 36 year-old blonde from his homeland.His two feuding daughters start to pull together to save their father. And as the book continues we learn of the terrible lives of the father and elder daughter in World War 2 Ukraine...Parts of the narrative involving the dreadful Valentina come across as a somewhat unbelievable and over-the-top farce; maybe it would have been better if it was written as either a tragic or comic novel and not an uneasy mix of the two. But it kept me reading to the end."
2,Hilarious It Isn't!,"Reviewers who rave about this book must not read much. It isn't a totally uninteresting story but would have been better published as a short story. The blurb from The Times on the book's jacket said ""Extremely funny"" but my guess is the complete quote was ""With this premise, this book should be extremely funny, but it isn't."" It was mildly interesting but you could tell it was a first book as the writing was rather clumsy and she repeated herself a lot.I do believe the author's attempt to draw an allegory about Russia and the USSR versus the capitalist west was clever but she just didn't pull it off sufficiently to satisfy.Perhaps my reading of this book suffered most because it followed a reading of Saturday by Ian McEwan, a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong; this book had it's moments but there just weren't enough of them."
1,I had to force my self to finish...,"I had heard only praise for this book. I started with high hopes, but after about the second chapter I already hated it.For me, perhaps the most annoying thing about the writing, is the authors usage of explanatory details in parentheses. She uses them a lot, way way too much. It becomes annoying and stupid when the same joke about a big breasted Ukrainian or how someone pronounces English appears every other page in parenthesesAs for the book allegedly being funny, I don't think I laughed once. The jokes are childish.In the end, I have no idea how this book has won so much praise."
3,hmm...,"I was honestly a bit disappointed. I read ""Strawberry Fields"" before this one and really enjoyed her writing style and the whole story. Then I picked up this book, but was disappointed because it seemed like it was going back and forth about the same thing. I liked the fact though that I learned some Ukrainian history and the struggles with aging fathers who start dating much younger women. It shed some light on aging and family relationships as well.It was not funny though. There were some times where I was chuckling a little bit, but this was not a comedy to me. I really don't know why some of the critics described it as a comedy."
5,"Tak, duzhe harosho","This book is a delight - but especially for anyone with any sort of background or experience of Eastern Europe. The characters are amazingly true-to-life - they make you laugh and make you cry, and in doing so illustrate the chequered history of Ukraine. It's a land that's been left a grim legacy by the Soviet Union - but the people bounce back, in whatever way they can. It's a great story of family interactions, between two sisters, their elderly father, and his new wife - and I loved every word."
4,great read,"Remarkeable funny and tender story of two sisters who try to rescue their eccentric 70ish father from the marrying a much younger money grabbing immigrant. I somehow found myself rooting for everyone in this lovely little book, and smiling thruout. Great read"
3,"good comedy, poor tragedy","Lewycka has produced an easy read that is funny at times, with one or two laugh out loud moments. Valentina is a vivid antagonist who lights up every page she appears on. The father-daughter conflicts and seething sibling rivalry make for some excellent comic moments. Where the novel falls down is when it tries to evoke tragedy in glimpses of the family's past suffering. Lewycka certainly has a comic touch, but the sense of regret and decades-old pain she attemps to evoke here is beyond the faltering power of her prose. She is more David Lodge than Nick Hornby. I enjoyed the read, but forgot most of it within days. Sometimes you want a book like that, so if you are in the mood for a light read, you could do worse than A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian."
3,Less a short history of tractors and more a short history of the Mayevskij family!,"Three and a half stars!Whilst certainly amusing at times (images of the **** car spring to mind) I wouldn't have described it as 'uproariously funny' like one review on the back cover said.It was an interesting observation of people and their needs and how we can view things from a different perspective if we care to bother. The 'old fool' or the lonely old man?I enjoyed the characters; the sisters, Vera and Nadezhda and their rivalry, the greedy Valentina and Nikolai, the father. I felt his relationship with his daughters and his mind changing regarding Valentina typified an elderly man who just wanted someone to love and care for him."
4,excellent novel,Thought provoking and entertaining novel- a great mix of depth and light hearted story telling..
3,Interesting,"It wasn't my favorite book, but I didn't completely hate it. The parts about Ukrainian history were very fascinating to me--more so than the history of tractors, but I have to admit that it was woven in well. Also, speaking from personal experience I found that the father's attitude and comments toward his new bride were very realistic. There were a few parts that lagged a bit for my taste, but nothing completely unbearable."
2,Disappointed,"I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this book. In fact, I'm not even sure why I forced myself to finish it, since I simply did not care what happened to any of the characters. Nor did I find the book at all amusing--I don't believe I laughed at any point. I agree with those reviewers who've suggested that this would be a better short story than novel, because the events in the book are very repetitive. However, I would probably still not read it, even as a short story. While it is by no means the worst book I've ever read, it simply did not engage me at all."
4,More about families than tractors....,"I don't usually read novels but the title of this book (together with a drawing of an Ukranian tractor on the cover) was too much for me to pass by.It tells the story of first and second generation Ukrainian exiles in British town - an elderly, lonely widowed father whose heart is still very much in the ""old country"" and his two feuding daughters. The book has much humour and amusing insights into the seam between British middle-class provincial society and the world of refugees in the New Europe. Nikolai (the father) falls in love (or so he thinks) with a busty Ukranian , Valentina, who seeks a better life in the UK for herself and her son Stanislav. Nadezhada, one of the daughters (in whose first person the book is written) is appalled , detests the potential stepmother and only finds sympathy for her after the marriage breaks down. An entertaining read."
4,Funny and a little bit sad,"I found this book quite refreshing after a couple of recent bad picks. It concerns a love-sick (or lust-sick) 84 yr old male immigrant from the Ukraine who is marrying a thirty-four yr old immigrant who merely wants money and a British passport (in no particular order). The man's two daughters, now grown up in Britain with families of their own, are obviously very against the woman and the marriage. That's the humour side of it. There is a darker side to the story shown as flashbacks to the man and one of his daughters earlier lives in the Ukraine but not too much- just enough to give depth to things. The book is an easy read, a page turner, refreshingly different and delves into subjects like relationships between siblings and dotty old parents. I would highly recommend it."
4,"sad,charming and surprisingly good","This book is a big hit in Australia and my curiosity compelled me to recommend it for my book group.Ultimately, I very much enjoyed it. Yes, it was farcsical at times and the viagra jokes were getting a bit tired. Valentina is a huge stereotypical 'type'(in joke here)but great fun in lots of ways.The excerpts from Nicolai's Tractor book became a bit dull, but the historical references to the war, Stalin and the labour camps were insightful and thought provoking.Deviating from the main story of crass,coniving refugee trying to take advantage of a poor crazy old man, I was drawn to the 'family' story and particualrly the relationship between the two sisters and their relationship with their father. The irony is that without the greedy 'slut' divorcee the sisters would still be on non-speaking terms and their father would be dying of loneliness.I would acutally like to give this 4 1/2 stars as 4 doesnt seem enought, yet 5 doesnt allow for the odd flaw."
4,Memorable characters,"This is the story of an old Ukrainian man who decides to get married to a much younger Ukrainian divorcee and the struggle of his daughters to get their father back. This was a funny book (although not knee slapping funny) with memorable characters. The readers are told the story of family history and the father's description of the developments in tractors from the agricultural to the industrial economy. The family history presented to the reader in installments, provides insight and depth to the characters. And the information about the development of tractors helps the reader to understand and appreciate the differences between the characters."
4,Hands Free head set,I had a hands free ear bud and this is much better for comfort and it seems to be clearer on both ends. The mike on the other picked up a lot of extra noise and this one doesn't. I like the tap answer and hang up feature too so you never have to go to the phone.Chas
1,Instructions?,"Opinon reserved 'till further experimenting. Admitedly non-gadget friendly, I have not been successful in determining how to hear person on the other end. The device came with no instruction."
5,My son LOVES this book!,"My 3-year-old son absolutely adores this book and CD. He loves looking at the beautiful color pictures and listening to me sing the songs. He has even picked up the words to many of the songs, and likes to sing along. The songs are unusual -- I had not heard most of them -- and beautiful, with lovely messages about nature and joyful living. A good change from the common nursery rhymes all children learn. There are also some games (actions) suggested for some songs. I took the book to my son's preschool and we sang songs and did the motions -- the kids loved it. I have bought four copies of this book to give away to friends and relatives."
4,Good book with unique songs and beautiful illustrations,"This is an excellent book for someone looking for unique children's songs from a variety of ethnic origins. I did not know any song in this collection, although I am familiar with several of the poems from which some of them originate.The CD is very helpful to hear the songs played and sung, although the style of the choir is not my favorite and I find the recordings a bit monotonous as a whole. The songs themselves are very different in style and origin, and I wish the recordings were equally varied.For someone looking for a collection of more popular children's songs that your kids might already be singing I would recommend Singing Bee, but if you want variety and uniqueness, this is the book for you.The illustrations are beautiful, and my daughter loves to flip through the book and make up her own songs based on the images!"
5,Great tool for improved breathing for wind players!,This is a great tool for working on improved volume and smoothness of breathing and articulation! I have had one for several years and it finally started looking so used I bought another for myself and one for a student!
4,Interesting Legal Historical Fiction,"This was a truely unique novel. I have not seen a historical fiction that is centered around legal issues and the difficulties of women trying to break into the legal arena. While I was surprised and a bit disappointed that there was not also a love story as you often find in historical fiction books, I still thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others."
4,Good read!,I bought this book for my kindle. I've never read anything written by James Scott Bell so I wasn't sure what to expect. I found the book unique in its setting - turn of the century Los Angeles and also because of the heroine's profession. I felt like the book was paced well and interesting. I was encouraged by her faith in the Lord. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. Recommend!
4,It's fine,"I was replacing the wires after ~150K miles, just because. The previous wires were OEM replacements, and seemed to be cut a bit better to length, but these are fine after a bit of finagling that cost them a star.Word of warning - be sure that the rubber grommet from your spark plug socket is not stuck on the plug you're trying to insert the wire onto. It's a good way to exercise your vocabulary, but doesn't get the job done. Also, I highly recommend using a metal wire removal/insertion tool on a VW VR6; I wouldn't trust the one on the prop rod of my car."
3,Beckett DP400 pond or fountain submersible pump,"The Beckett DP400 was purchased for a wall mounted plaster fountain where water flows up from a reservior to a lion's head and into a small upper basin; then down from the small upper pool through slots back into the lower main reservoir.The pump had more volume than could be modulated with the intake valve feature. The force of the water caused the water eject port to overshoot the fountain entirely. I should have done more research!What I did notice, though, is that the pump was quite loud. Maybe when submerged into an actual pond, or if used in a large concrete fountain, there would be enough water and other material to insulate from that annoyance. TBD."
4,Great for small fountains or ponds,This is a good fairly strong pump for small to medium sized fountains or ponds. It has been running for months now continuously and no problems. My only complaint is that it does not have a flow control valve as it shows in the picture. Also the lift tube that attaches to the pump is slightly too large in diameter and sometimes pops off due to the force of the water.
1,Dead after 3 months,"Great price, and when it worked it was great, but after 3 months it started buzzing and now is dead, dead, dead."
4,beckett pond pump works,I received the pump in good order and so far (about 1 month) it has been working continuously without any problems.
3,"Irony in the title, a good read in between the covers","This book is a very entertaining read and an accurate depiction of the highs and lows of the start-up game. Sally leaves the door open to dot.com success even after the market turn as long as people execute flawlessly. Many of the gotchas are highlighted in this book. The chapter on branding ""Brand This!"" is fantastic!"
2,Cooler Master NotePal Widescreen Notebook Cooler ( R9-NBC-AWAK ),"This product works great for keeping the laptop cool (at least cooler), but is not very good for using on your lap. It is made out of medal with sharp corners that dig in when you use it on your lap. If you are looking for a tray to keep you laptop cooler while working at a desk, this is pretty good. If you are like most of us, and use your laptop on you lap, this is not the tray for you."
2,NOT FOR MAC,"I work on 3D design and need my MAC 100% powered upThis is USELESS for MAC LAPTOPS the ventilation from bellow is just not enough. The Fans are too weak, maybe if your laptop has vents from bellow, but you can buy the $15 acrylic ones and get more vents even. The base support blocks any disks from the front so only the side ones work well on this. the ON/OFF button is useless because if you want to turn it off you can just unplug it (and an unused base is even more useless!!)If your MAC heats up just download SpeedFanI havent found any windows driver that can control my MAC Laptop's fans so in Bootcamp it ALWAYS heats up to 80 deg Celc.You get a black painted metal base instead an aluminium colored onethe metal scratches your laptops base unless you place extra rubber piecesIn the end... NOT WORTH IT...."
2,Cooler master does it again...,"Cooler master has the habit of coming up with good ideas in concept and then failing on the execution. This is one of those cases.- Not deep enough. Laptop wants to flop off the back when I tilt my screen too far back.- Strangely, it kept making my WinXP laptop blue screen. So either there's a short in the wiring (yikes!), the USB cable is hitting some of the wrong contacts in the USB port (yikes again!), or the thing is trying to pull too much power from the USB port. So either shoddy manufacturing, shoddy supplied parts or shoddy product design.Also, if your lappy has front-facing audio ports, this cooler has a front lip that will prevent you from being able to use them.As a work-around, I had the front of my laptop sitting up on top of the front lip of the cooler."
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought this from Amazon a few months ago, hoping to lower my temp. When I got the product, i hooked it all up, and was very disappointed with the results. First off, I have a Dell XPS m1530, so all the ports in the front of the computer (headset jack x2, mic input) were covered by the front lip of the cooling devise. In addition, my laptop temperature only dropped about 3 degrees C using this. Would not recommend, I'm moving to one of those special crystal cooling pads that doesn't use power to operate."
2,"this cooler is too small for an HP 17"" laptop","Length:: 0:23 MinsWith an HP Pavilion ZD8000 17"" laptop, this cooler is not stable, see video. The design seems strong and sturdy, and the fans good, but the platform is too short for a 17"" laptop, the back end of laptop hangs over the back edge of cooler too far and is unstable."
4,Does the job well,"I bought this product to use with my 17"" wide screen Inspiron 9300, which became blazing hot with heavy graphics card load. Now, my laptop barely gets warm.The only problem is with the size. The width fits perfectly, but the front to back length is about 3 inches short. This short length has the benefit of allowing the notebooks built in fans access to good air flow, but it also means that the notebook's back feet have no support. Also, the extra weight on the back of the notebook, due to the monitor, can cause the computer to tip back when using this on your lap."
4,NotePal Works,This notebook cooler is sturdy and does keep my laptop slightly cooler. The fans aren't noisy.
1,Not for all 17 inch laptops.,It is too shot for my DELL Inspiron 1520. The rear stands of the laptop fall outside the base of this cooler.
4,My laptop never overheats now!,"I'm glad to say that my laptop never overheats since i got the NotePal. however, the design doesn't quite work for my widescreen Averatec laptop. The cooling fans on the NotePal are located at the rear of the product, and the hottest part of my laptop is typically in the front. The fan placement doesn't alleviate this heat build up. So, i have to put my laptop on it backwards to allow for the fans to cool the hot spots.Aside from this, the product does prevent my laptop from overheating and shutting down, which it used to do after more than 2 hours of use (and the inside of the laptop was indeed totally clean and to spec!). I recommend this product!"
1,Buy it if your notebook is disposable,"I bought this for my son's Dell notebook. The notebook died one hour after it was plugged into its USB port. The screen does not come on, and HD does not spin up. My guess is that it overloaded the USB port and subsequently fried the motherboard.This has been a very painful experience, when the helper you expected turned into a killer."
1,Does not cool at all,"I got this cooler for my Macbook pro 15 inch. The fans are definitely very very quiet, but I think the reason why they're so quiet is because they blow so little air out from the fans. The air that's being blown out is equivalent to someone gently blowing through their mouth. The made the air output absolutely negligible, and so the heat on my Macbook Pro is still very hot. I didn't notice a drop in temperature at all. The aluminum cooler actually started heating up as well.This cooler did not work for me. So that's $30 down the drain."
2,A Balancing Act...,"I have a Dell Inspiron 1720 and the Notepal is not deep enough,front to back, for my PC to sit in it properly. It is also heavy. Especially when combined with my PC. Picture me trying to sit and hold my PC, this cooler, and do a balancing act to hold it all together without dropping the whole thing. It will keep your computer running cool. But the reason I bought it was to keep my leg from burning up while holding my laptop in my lap. The 2 fans are relatively quiet and are supposed to be good for 30,000 hours. It comes with a USB cable and needs no other power source. If you only use your laptop on a desktop then this might be good enough but lap use is precarious at best."
3,Notebook Cooler-Design needs work,"The cooler does seem to keep my computer cooler than just sitting in my lap, and the design seems pretty rugged. However, it is not nearly large enough (front to back) for my HP Pavilion zd8000 laptop, and it really is not comfortable at all. I continue to use if for the good of my laptop, but it is not nearly as comfortable as just the laptop."
5,Coolermaster Widescreen Cooler,"Nice product -- very sturdy with aircraft-grade metal. I only have one gripe--it is a bit too small from front to back. Check the dimensions before you purchase. It does keep my hot laptop quite cool, even though I had to install some rubber pads to support the back part of my laptop."
3,"Good design, but narrow","I have 2 of the smaller NotePals for my 15"" screen laptop - one at work, and the other at home, which do WONDERFUL work keeping my laptop cool. So I was anxious to get the wider version for the new 17"" laptop, and I find that the 17"" model is similarly narrow - the laptops hang over the back edge by about 2 inches. Therefore the back support on all the laptops actually rest on the case, not on the laptop's rubber feet. It doesn't seem to hurt anything. I'd rather the aluminum extrusions be deeper so that the laptops rest fully on the cooler. Given the front lip of the cooler is about the same depth as the laptop overhang in back, I'm guessing the intent was to be able to also fit the cooler in a laptop bag. This is not a feature I desire, but one some people may. The design is excellent, very sturdy, and the workmanship top notch. I have both the silver and black now - the black is a bit prettier, but the aluminum is very professional looking, too."
4,Nice cooler ...but,"I've had this cooler for over a year now. It works well, but I have one complaint. I take my laptop on and off constantly and the front of my laptop (15"" macbook pro) has marks from where the edge of the cooler hit it many times. I solved further problems by attaching adhesive 'bumper' pads that I just cut to fit along the edge of the metal."
4,Chill,Like night and day. My HP is running about 20 dergees cooler and the fans no longer sound like they are about to take off. Should have bought this a long time ago.
3,NOISY,BOUGHT THIS A FEW MONTHS AGO AND IT HAS WORKED FINE. HAS STARTED TO MAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF NOICE ON STARTUP NOW THOUGH. SEEMS TO QUIET DOWN AS IT WARMS.
4,Good product...not perfect,"This laptop cooler does a good job overall. It is wide enough and provides a stable platform. The fans are virtually silent due to the low rpm's. However, this is also the cooler's biggest shortcoming. The fans just don't provide much airflow. This product would be much better if it had multiple speeds. It does provide decent cooling, and for most people will be enough to provide the relief they are looking for. Another caveat, if you are planning to move this cooler around much, it is quite heavy and most people will find it cumbersome. The cooler is well-built and works as advertized. It just falls short of being a great product."
1,Do Yourself a favor - Don't get it,"I've owned one now for less than a month and one of the fans is screaming like a banshee. It's so annoying that I've turned them off. Not only that, but even during it's flash of marginally meaningful existence, it didn't do much in the way of keeping my Dell E1505 Inspirion cool.Not at all worth the price. I don't know if any of the othe cooling pads are any better, but I strongly urge you to look at other brands and then if you still can't find something, do without."
4,"Great, but...","Soud quality of mic and earphones is excellent and outside sound isolation is great. Nice carrying case and comes with a wide selection of sizes and types of plugs for any ear. Although they are very sturdy, they are a bit bulky and the volume control (which is very sensitive) and mute button are very near the phone plug. Better design would probably be to merge the microphone with the volume/mute control and put it at the join of the two earphone wires."
3,Worth the read or not? Don't know.,"Not as ""user-friendly"" as some of his other books I've read. The first two-thirds of it felt like a text book, like kind of an academic stretch to sew together some dissimilar fabrics that kept wanting to fray. I read it in tandem with a friend who is a Buddhist, a long time psychologist and PhD, then we discussed it. She liked it and thought it brought her some knowledge she could use in her practice. Although I understand the concept and I don't disagree, I don't feel I gained much from the read overall. Maybe too academic for my artist soul."
3,"Not as good as the others, but still a good read","Enjoyed the book, but figured out the mystery about 10 pages in! Either way, I enjoyed Lily and all of the other characters."
4,I love a quick read,"I began to read this series because I really enjoy the Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series and so I thought this would be another good series to read. It is. These Books are quick to read and if you are a fan of the stackhouse books you will meet Lily Bard as a character in ""Dead as a Doornail"". It's just a small part but it's nice to be reminded of her character.Lily Bard is as different from Sookie as you could find, but there are similarities to there basic characters.I took all five of the books in this series as something light to read on the plane to and from California and for the week I was there. It was a great series to read and I left them for my daughter in law to read as she picked up the first book when I had finished it. Both her and my son enjoyed the books. They are great to read in airports, Dr. appointments, and times when you need that little something to keep you entertained while you are hurry up and waiting."
4,Great series.,"Even though there was a tragedy in her life, she became an example of a strong survivor. I thoroughly enjoyed reading each and every book in the series."
3,"Buy the book, don't buy the KINDLE book!","""Shakespeare's Trollop"" by Charlaine Harris is a horrid e-book...The type is very hard to read, the ""family tree"" is so small that it can not be read. There are no section dividers, which makes the book very difficult to read. Very poorly done."
3,Its Killing Time in Shakespeare Again...(3 1 /2 stars),"Poor Deedra Dean is Shakespeares latest victim in this 4th Lily Bard. And who better to find the body than Miss Lily herself?Shakespeares Trollop was an entertaining read, but compared to the previous books in this series,I thought ST was a little predictable and not as gripping, but it did have some rather juicy moments such as a riveting little tidbit involving Bobo. I just love Bobo. I know hes just a college boy ,but wowee what a cutie. Anyways, back to the story...a quick enjoyable read, but nothing that got me wild. I of course plan on finishing the series, but for now, I think Im going to take a break from Shakespeare."
4,WHAT A BLAST !!!!!,"Some UK 82 bands reunited in the 90's to belt out plain cr@p.Or just MORE plain cr@p(depending on what thet were playin in the 80's).Not the case.These dudes are like good wine.Straight out hardcore,loud and fast,with blazing guitar chord stuctures slightly reminscent of The Varukers,machine gun drumming,massive vocals,and a fat bass guitar that'll shake your foundations.Like 40% of the songs are reggae/ska tinged,never detracting from hardcore though;the result is amazingly good (no resemblance of No Doubt !!! ).Very lenghty at 64' +(no fillers,pure excitement),it includes a full album and several 7'' eps,all very well remastered for this edition (orig recordings span 96-00).I could have used a louder snare in the mix,but hey,that's just me !! WORTH EVERY PENNY !!!"
4,Odyssey - 'Setting Forth' (Lion Productions),"What is there - like maybe fifteen bands out there with the same monicker? Nonetheless this over-looked gem was originally released in 1969, this was the obscure New York psych band's only lp. Tunes the did the most for me were ""Sally"" (featuring nice keyboard playing), ""Church Yard"" (sort of reminds me of maybe early Deep Purple), ""Society's Child"", ""Denky's Boogie"" (with some killer harmonica) and the awesome rocker ""Come Back"" with it's swirling keyboard (possibly the CD's best track, hands down). Personnel: Louis Yovino - vocals, Fred Callan - guitar, Vincent E. Kusy - keyboards and Jay Sharkey - drums. Should appeal to fans of Iron Butterfly, Arzachel, Sub, Frijid Pink and possibly the Amboy Dukes."
2,not this book,"I too thought this was a different book. I have learned that the book I see all the time on talk shows, and last week in Dear Abby, was a book by Nancy Kalish, a psychologist, called Lost & Found Lovers. It is out of print but I found her web site, www.lostlovers.com, where you can still buy it new. And there's a cool message board there too.I read kalish's book and loved it. It is more real - 1000 couples. Buy that one."
1,I must have read a different book!,"When I first read all of the other reviews for this book, I had to double-check to make sure that I was writing about the same book! The stories in this paperback were so sappy and totally implausible, the book read like a fantasy novel (and a bad one at that). I'd love to believe in fated/pre-destined romance (believe me!), but one would have to really suspend their own sense of possiblility to ""buy into"" the stories in this book. I'm very sorry, because I really wanted this book to be great."
5,Love Lost and Found by Carolyn Campbell,This is a great book! I started reading it while excercising but when I was finished biking I found that I could not put it down and read it all in one weekend! Thank you for such a heart warming story
4,"Predictable, All-Around, Neutral Strings","The Dominant strings sets the standard for synthetic violin strings, and is usually the default string to put on an instrument. It is middle of the road, and gives a pretty decent, although somewhat sterile, tone. When it is new, there is a slight metallic feel, but that goes away after it is stretched out. They last about 2-3 months, fairly bright, but with good overtones, and then gradually get duller. The E string is just ordinary, and many people substitute a different E string (such as Pirastro Gold). I like the Kaplan Solo E string with the Dominant G, D, A."
1,piece of junk,"Recieved this TV as a Christmas present 2007. It is now 1 year and 4 Mos old and the warrenty is up and the DVD player has to be replaced at a price of $264.10. No thanks I'll do without a DVD player in the Den. TV works fine . I will never buy a Sylvania product again. Customer service was no help at all, even though it was just 94 days after warrenty. A real piece of junk."
1,Had a Short Life . . .,This tv broke after 1 1/2 years of use. I'm quite disappointed. A blue line developed that ran vertically along the right side of the screen. I read online that applying some pressure with the palm of your hand would make the blue line go away. This worked for a few weeks but eventually the blue line continued to come back and my little trick stopped working - gotta buy a new tv or deal with this little distracting blue line torturing my soul for the rest of my tv viewing life.
1,Dont buy from electronic Express,"I ordered this item with the shipping time between may 5 -8. Om may 8th I was told that it was out of stock. I had already thrown out my old TV and took a day off from work, then that afternoon I receive the e-mail. I went back to my open orders to leave feedback and get refund and it was magically gone. I hope I get my refund. Do NOT TRUST ELECTRONIC EXPESS BUY FROM ANY ONE ELSE.VERY UNHAPPY IN NEW YORK(JANICE) Product Sylvania LD 200SL8 20"" LCD TV WITH BUILT IN dvd player, it might have been a good product but I will never know"
4,Great set,"We're very happy with this TV; fits exactly into the space we had available, nice bright picture, easy to set up and use."
4,Sylvania TV many features and low cost,"I purchased 8 of these for my furnished apartments. I was looking for a large enough screen, a dvd player and good price. I found all of these in this TV set. The image is a little cold and even after making adjustments for warmth and color and tone, I still think the image is too cold. But the price is right and my guests are happy!"
2,Cleans off dust but leaves streaks behind,"I bought these wipes to clean my LCD monitor. While they do clean off dust, they also leave a lot of streaks behind. The streaks are almost more annoying than the dust! I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. I've read and followed the instructions on the container. After wiping multiple times I just end up with more and more streaks. Based on my experiences, I can't recommend this product for cleaning LCD monitors. I don't know if it works any better on other types of electronics."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"This story is wonderful...it allows you to really experience the relationships involved in the book. You feel a part of Jazper and Nathan's lives and all that they experience. You will laugh, cry, become sad and ultimately rejoice in the end. It is a page-turner like no other. Once you start you will not be able to stop.Often time you read a book to the end and you are left wondering, with Jazper and Nathan, while you can evision so much more, you are left with some finality.It is wonderful...A must read for anyone, but especially for a girl, guy, man or woman who may not be comfortable with their body and may feel like they are doomed to loneliness. Your soulmate is out there, keep hope alive!"
1,Lots of potential not used,"This book was a disappointment. The author basically just copied various website pages and threw them together in this book. There was so much opportunity to write a really good book on the online ""ana community"" that she just didn't use or do. Not worth the money, or time to read. Do your own online research and I guarantee you will get much more quality information."
1,Waste of money.,"Please, save your money. ""Ana's Girls"" is far from an ""essential guide"" to the pro-ana community; the vast majority of the book is excerpts from various web sites. Although the material is interesting, you could easily find it online for free. Furthermore, I was hoping for some in-depth analytical text about the community and about larger cultural issues, but the author only provided basic, common-sense, surface-level analysis. She doesn't even use secondary sources to back up what little she does have to say. If you want to learn about this community, I recommend doing a little research via Google, but don't waste your money on this book."
1,Horrible,I threw this book in the garbage and my friend pulled it out and took it home with him. Now hes starting to act like a anarexinc girl. Its really pissing me off. Dont buy it out of morbid couriosity. I did and my friend read and took it as truth. now hes going threw some real issues. TRIGGERING> WARNING> Dont buy this book. it only spreads lies and yucky stuff.
1,Don't waste your money!!!,How this book got published...I don't know. It was terrible!!! It is full of misspelled words and most of it is copied from pro ana websites. You won't get anything from this book that you can't get off the internet. Don't waste your money. It's not a thinspiration book nor is it educational. I returned this garbage and got my money back :)
5,To clear things up,"The below reviewer is mistaken. This set does not have Callas and Lauri-Volpi. Stop writing the same review for three different recordings of ""Il Trovatore"" that the product details clearly state do not contain singing by Callas and Lauri-Volpi."
1,"Great recording, but sound quality falls apart often","This is the first complete Il Trovatore recording I listen to. For the most part they sound great. Many of the great hits were taken from this CD set.But, there are passages that doesn't sound normal. They sound like the passages were not properly digitized. Maybe others can comment if this problem is not isolated only to my CD set."
1,Does not offer practical advice...Just theory,"If you are looking for a boring theoretical discussion of the subject of sexual harassment, this dated book is for you."
4,Very helpful if not quite perfect,"I found Outreach Spanish to be very helpful in learning common Spanish phrases, numbers, greetings, etc.. I especialy liked that he wrote out the pronounciations for every word. This book is most useful for a student like myself who has a limited background in Spanish. After reading and reviewing the book, I feel much more confident speaking Spanish in public.There's a few errors in the book--for example, Harvey gets the ei dipthong wrong--he pronounces seis as two separate syllables. That's annoying, for sure, but I suggest buying it anyway. You get a lot of useful information at a reasonable price."
1,Outreach Spanish,For me this book was a waste of time. It is written for the beginning student or possibly someone working at a job that needs just a smattering of Spanish. . . more of a vocabulary book. If you want to learn Spanish do not buy this book.
1,very poor organization,It's impossible to find what you need to find when you need to find it in this book: it is just a mass of information with no index or table of contents to help students locate information. NOT RECOMMENDED.
1,Not worth it!!!,"This book and cassette package is really not the kind of Spanish course it is made up to be. I have studied several languages before using ""teach yourself"" material, and this is the worst by far. Whatever excercises are offered are totally inadequate. The book is in effect hardly more than a glorified vocab list. The presentation are simplified to the point of being misleading (The pronunciation guide for consonants being a case in point). The course presentation generally lacks in any understanding of the underlying processes of language acquisition."
4,Great for young children,"A great way for young children to learn simple facts about a Saint's life. Each drawing step is simple, so even a mom who can't draw well (like me!) can break it down and even a child who can't draw well (like one of mine!) can be successful by the end of the lesson. Love that it is spiral bound, too!"
2,Marea is actually Navy!,Very disappointed only with the color of the marea that we ordered. It's actually navy blue and khaki.... not the lovely bright blue and white that the picture shows :( Not sure if I'm going to return it or not..
3,Somewhat regret the purchase....,"My son is now 6 months old and I have just purchased a new convertible carseat to replace this one. There are a few things wrong with this car seat:-> while very safe, it is not high on the comfort level. When I look at other car seats they look as if they considered comfort. Not here. My DS hates getting into this seat.-> The color of the side impact - very dark and very hot in the summer monthsWhile I love the stroller that i Purchased (Aria) since it is so light - this seat is so heavy that I never carry it out of the car anymore. This is my first baby - I am not certain that I will use this car seat for a second one. I would suggest not to buy this sight unseen and without really shopping. We bought it because Peg Perego ""travel system"" only works with their car seats."
5,Safe and Fun,"I got this for my newborn and I really love it. I wanted an infant car seat that I could use with a stroller as a travel system.This car seat goes great with the Pliko P3 stroller. I was also looking for a fun bright color for my baby boy and not the usual patterns and prints that you see at your local baby. It also has high safety ratings. At first I was looking at the Britax infant car seat, but it is so much bulkier than this one. This one fits great in my VW Tiguan."
5,A great car seat indeed,We used this car seat until recently switching to the Maxi Cosi Priori. The Peg Perego was totally great! No complaints at all. We switched because baby reached the weight limit on this seat. We traveled with it several times. It held up in the airline cargo and is very safe and stable.
2,HEAVY!,"This car seat has great, user friendly features. It has an easy to use base with easy to use LATCH system. The strap adjustment is very easy - you just use a slider to move them up or down. The only bad part (besides how ridiculously expensive it is!) is that it is like carrying a boat anchor around (without your child in the seat!). Try a Chicco instead!"
4,Car seat Peg Perego,Great Seat. Weight is not an issue for me. Very well made and I like the orange and brown. Fabric is easy to clean. The handle fits well and is a good balance point for carrying. Seat snaps into base easily. It seems a little large to me but I do not have much to compare it to. Price was good as it was on sale.
2,Buy a Chicco Keyfit instead,"I am 5'10"" and very strong--no shrinking violet here--but even I had a hard time carrying this around. I would always wonder what a petite woman would do if she had to lug this car seat around with a growing infant sitting in it. Heavy is an understatement. I have since bought a Chicco Keyfit and have been very pleased. It is the safest on the market and about half the price. Do yourself a favor and skip this one!"
2,Regret this purchase with every use,"I bought this car seat thinking that it was the absolute safest thing out there and was thus willing to overlook its ridiculous weight. Now, it seems that Consumer Reports has other options (the Chicco KeyFit 30) that have the same (if not better) safety rating and MUCH better overall score (not to mention $100 cheaper...)My #1 complaint is that the belt is really hard to use...especially with a squirmy child who is not very happy about being strapped in...it takes forever to get the snaps into place. I seriously curse it every time.My baby is 12mo now and about 23 lbs and she's getting too big for it (her feet have to almost straddle the seat!)...but she is pretty tall...We're ready for a convertible seat now.I may keep this one around as a spare for the next kid, but would not recommend it."
1,Wheels about to fall off,"All the previous reviews...pay attention. The plastic acorn nuts that hold on the ill-fitted wheels are terrible. Don't purchase this, pay a few dollars more for a tested model."
1,"item sold as new, not new","Item sold as new in unsealed box with small parts scattered in box to be lost in mail. Manufacture states small parts usually bagged, but no so with this ite. Nuts and bolts thrown into box to roll around and be lost in shipping. Manufacture then expects me to fax or email receipt on item to replace lost parts. One expects new products to be properly packaged. Also do not expect to have to find receipt to send to manufacture for replacement...this is not hassle free shopping when I have to get transportation to a fax machine rather than calling amazon to have issue resolved. I could go to a local store rather than deal with this nonsense. Of course it could have been prevented had I not been sold an unsealed package which was represented as a new product. Never had this issue in years of amazon shopping...very disappointed."
5,Does what I bought it for,I bought the cart for my recycle bin. It makes it easy to pull it to the curb on recycle day. Saves my back.I did have a friend put it together for me one evening. Took about an hour. Very sturdy.
2,wet nose,"the design looks solid but in use is awkward. the plastic wheel inside is not really necessary. the flip top is right in the brow line when drinking. occasionally some drinks need to be shaken more than once, if you're not chugging them, in which case the flip top holds onto a little liquid and will drip onto your nose when drinking."
4,Another good effort,"These authors are well-established as the premier non-fiction authors of ""Doctor Who"". Here, we are presented with another familiar book in a familiar format, which works without being outstanding."
1,cheap,These glasses are very cheaply made and are so small that my three yr old can wear them. It is not worth paying the shipping to send them pack so as I said my three yr old now has a pair of glasses...
3,Not an acuratte classification,"This CD has very good songs, like El Muerto (by Fabulosos Cadillacs) and Gol De Mujer (by Divididos). But this CD appears like it's a LFC (Los Fabulosos Cadillacs) album! (An Amazon mistake?). Some songs are unknown, so I don't recommend it. And if you prefer to get the 2 or 3 good songs, you'd better buy the original CDs. Possibly you can recognize even more songs. But it's not bad enough. It's a good selection, like all compilations I know. That's why I give it 3 stars and not more."
4,Funny zombie flick,"I think this was a low budget film, but it is still very well done and has parts that any zombie flick lover will enjoy. Worth the time to watch."
5,one great book,This book has it all from pictures to journal writings. This book tells about EC's struggles as a young boy in art school to his marriage and even about his drug habits. This book is number one in my book and always will. It is a must read.
4,The definitive biography of EC as a man.,"Ray Coleman was granted amazing access to Eric, his family and friends. This is the best book on the market about Eric as a person. Roberty's books are more comprehensive about his music, but the late, great Melody Maker editor Ray Coleman knew and loved Eric for many years, and has rare insight."
1,"PVC pollutes, do not buy","Please do some research before considering getting pvc in your garden. Manufacturing pvc harms the environment, and also washes polluting material into the soil."
5,The Australian Morells!,"If Lou Whitney's father was an Aussie, he would've fronted this dynamite group. They were out in the early 70's with a couple of releases and then re-appeared in 94 with some new material. Another disc (New Daddy Cool) was the result. This old stuff is magic. Like the Skeletons/Morells they combined 50's rock with some greasy roots rock that's best described as real rock & roll. Pick this one up."
5,Encouraging Words,"Hi My name Mrs. Shelly Armstrong and I am a teacher in Ohio. I teach a creative writing course at a college. I have always loved to read romance books and fiction novels, preferrably fiction novels. I really enjoyed this novel to the fullest. You must have had a great teacher because the way you go from first person to third is remarkable. That is what I am always trying to teach my students. Well I just wanted to say a few words to the young lady that wrote this book. Maybe you should think about becoming a teacher because you are very good with words. Think about it and good luck."
3,Odd Child,"This memoir set in pre-World War II England has many very well written passages that nicely evoke a bygone era. It is centered on Professor Wollheim's recollections and introspections on his emotional start to life. With his sexual identity up in the air, being a social zero, and faced with irrational fears at every turn, this was not a blissfully happy childhood. Dr. Freud would have had a field day with this raw material of a life."
2,Air & Ground,"The new CD by LAGQ: Air & Ground is sadly a disappointment. While the playing ability of the members of the group is not in question - they are great guitarists and always will be. Their choices in music is the real problem with this CD. The selection leave a lot to be desired. Their atempts at the fusion of many styles leaves the album slow and plodding - not the exciting and inspiring choices of the past.This album qualifies as MUZAK. The truly redeeming performances on the album are the compositions by Scott Tennant. They are bright and fun to listen to. Andrew York's ""The Lotus Eaters"" is also a nice easy listening piece. The rest are rather plaintive and boring. They have gotten away from their roots and foundation, that which made them famous and endeared them to many, myself included. This directional shift will leave many disappointed."
5,Third Graders Love Library Lil!,"This review was written by third grade Class 344 at Chelsea Prep in Manhattan:Do you like to read crazy tall tales? Well, if you do, Library Lil by Suzanne Williams is perfect for you!This book is about a girl who loves books more than anything. She also has super-power stregnth. She grows up to be a librarian in a town that hates books. But that all changes after a stormy night. What will happen when a tough book-hating motorcycle gang comes to town? You'll have to read to learn the hilarious solution.Our favorite part is the dialogue between the gang members and Library Lil. ""Lily-livered cowards read books,"" the gang leader snarls. Wait until you read Lil's reply!We think you should read this book because it has a ton of humor in it, and Steven Kellogg's illustrations are the best! As Library Lil says, ""TV is the devil's invention,"" so get your read on!"
1,Heavenly Serbia: From Myth to Genocide ?,"The author has expressed an agenda which is not supported by the facts. I offer the reader the following works to gain a better insight into this subject: ""THE SERBIAN FOLK EPIC Its Theology and Anthropology by Rev. Dr. Krstivoj Kotur""; ""SAINT PETER OF MONTENEGRO by V. Rev. Vladimir M. Mrvichin""; ""THE MOUNTAIN WREATH of P.P. Nyegosh""; ""HERO TALES AND LEGENDS OF THE SERBIANS by W.M. Petrovich""; ""MARKO, THE KING'S SON by Clarence A. Manning"". A brief review of almost any of these works will provide clarity, when compered with Anzulovic's work. A number of other materials are available to the reader at less cost, and may provide insight to a area of world conflict (""SPY IN THE VATICAN by Bronkn Bokum""; ""THE SERBS CHOOSE WAR by Ruth Mitchell"";...)."
1,A Croation Screed,"If you want more Croation propaganda, this is your book. Dripping with hate, it at least gives you a sense of the type of thinking that caused Croatia to follow in the footsteps of the Nazi's during the second world war and today."
1,This book would be laughable if not for the...,"many people that are obviously lapping it up as well researched truth. What we have here is rehashed Croatian & Vatican propaganda that can be easily refuted by any serious, unbiased, scholarly college freshman."
1,Not a scientific work.,Bradimir Anzulovic is not a historian. His historical references are biast and racist. He uses historical references in order to provide a racist spin and misinform the reader. Anyone that has studied history will immediately see that this is not a scientific work based on truth.
2,Croatian Propaganda,"Mr. Anzulovic, a Croatian nationalist has written a book only a croat nationalist could write. One which essentially blames all the Balkans troubles on the Serbs. In that classic Balkan style, he simply omits any reference to Croatian crimes and builds a simplistic and at times, erroneous case against Serbs. The fact that the entire Serbian community was eradicated by Croatia in 1995 - a full 50 years after Nazi Croatia tried to do in in WWII, is avoided. Anzulovic chooses to ignore the details and simply parrots Zagrebs party propganda line."
2,Clear perspective,"Mr. Anzulovic is clearly attempting to present a Croatian view of the Serbs. Is this bad? Not necessarily, as long as the reader understands the specific viewpoint of any author. He attempts to examine Serbian intellectual thought, folk music and myth-making against a larger European intellectual and literary scene. This is at best a partial success as the author has predetermined his conclusions and is writing to prove baleful influence on Serb behavior over the centuries.I must note that, despite other reviewer's comments, Anzulovic does show occasional flashes of impartiality, by inclusion of more than one set of numbers for people killed at Jasenovac. Is this an impartial book? NO!Is this the perspective of one of the participants in the recent insane Balkan Wars? Yes. Readers must always remember this."
3,A disappointment - too flat,"First of all, I'm a licorice fiend - and not the so-called licorice typically sold in the US. I grew up in Sweden with the real deal - I even bought ultra-bitter licorice sticks from the pharmacy, back when they sold that.My favorites range from Malaco to Fazer - with ammonium chloride filled licorice candy like Turkish Pepper at the top.Bassett's is the substitute of choice in the US - not much available here.With that said, here's what I thought about Gustaf's - and I bought a whole case. It's too flat, it hits a very narrow band of licorice flavor - something missing to make it bloom.Great chewability, lots of licorice flavor, but no depth - if that makes sense to you. Most other licorice versions that I like hit a much broader range.It's worth a try, but I suggest that you make this a small portion of a mixed plate of various licorice types."
4,It is what it is...,"If you're looking for something sweet, keep looking. This item bills itself as ""double-salt"" and it definitely lives up to its self-description. Go to your refrigerator and take a spoon full of baking soda, now let it melt in your mouth while sniffing a box of Good and Plenty. You've now experienced the essence of the flavor provided by these double-salt licorice pieces without spending the $15. If this is what you're looking for, I highly recommend this product. I gave it 4 stars, because it is what is says it is. It's just not what I was looking for."
1,Disgusting and inedible,"I don't understand how anyone can eat or enjoy these. So if you are on the fence, stay away.I put one on my tongue and it burned. I can still taste the horrid bitterness and my eyes water at the memory.I love salted licorice in general but this stuff is disgusting."
1,Grotesque and not enjoyable,"GROSS! My workplace uses this as punishment when you lose a bet. Unless you're one with an ""acquired"" taste do not try it, believe me. Extremely salty."
1,warning: super salty,"i like black licorice. i like salty licorice. but this double salt is way too much. all you can taste is the salt. and it burns your mouth. i had my order delivered to work and had about 15 people here sample it as well, and not one person liked it. take this as a warning."
2,Way too salty,"First purchase I got were okay and I enjoyed them. But the second batch were just too salty to eat, I ended up throwing them out. When they say super salty... they mean it..all salt no licorice."
1,Double Salt and DOUBLE AMMONIA!,"The fourth ingredient in this candy is ammonium chloride. Too bad I didn't read the label before ingesting this product. It has been several hours since I ate my first and LAST two pieces of this candy and I still have the sensation and smell of ammonia in my nose. A spicy dinner and a Neti Pot nasal wash did not remove it.This is one of the worst things I have ever had in my mouth (or up my nose...) and I am heartily glad I bought a single carton at a local store before buying a CRATE at amazon.com.I'm a salty licorice lover. This licorice is very salty, hardly sweet (that's what I expected) but packs an unpleasant and lasting ammonia wallop that I found intolerable."
2,Double Salt,"I love licorice, but this was just too salty for me. I know it's not for everyone. Even my licorice LOVING horse won't eat it. I gave it to my Dutch asst. mgr. at work, & she doesn't care for it either. On the upside, however, her mom & sister's love it, so in truth, just because it's not for me, I cannot say negative things about it. Different tastes are what makes the world interesting."
2,IF you like salt,Way too much salt. My taste buds go into shock. You can only eat a few before you need a glass of water !
5,Best salty licorice I have tried,"Most people who try this hate it. So if you are curious don't buy the six pack. However, a distinct few like myself place these treats at the top of our ""confection favorites"" list. Texture plays a big part in me selecting this brand as my top choice of all salmiac candies. These are less gooey than other brands I have tried in and outside of Holland."
3,Good but not the same,When I grew up as a kid my grandparents would always bring DZ licorice with them when they would visit us from Rotterdam. Eventhough I like this licorice it is not the same as I remember when i was a kid. My dad told me the old DZ licorice was made from salt from the North Sea and this item does not have real salt. I guess they are trying save money or trying to be more healthy by using fake salt.
5,I loved it.,"Sadly most people I tried to share it with did not love it. Amazing how salty they are, a wonderful contrast to the dark black licorice flavor."
1,Could Not Even Finish It!!,"There are few books that I do not finish. This was one. When it takes pages and pages and pages to say something that could have been said in a paragraph (and even then, perhaps it wasn't worth saying), well that just doesn't cut it for me. This book dragged unbelievably, and it seemed to jump all over the place. I agree with someone else who said that Roth just kept writing like a very long (and unedited) stream of thought. I could not get into the characters at all. Perhaps to some, this is a great novel, and I am clearly in the minority, but for me - IT STUNK!!"
3,"Mundane suburbanality, complete with anxiety disorder.","So there's this guy who is a naturally gifted athlete with male model looks. He joins the Marines, then goes to college, inherits his fathers successful factory, and marries a beauty queen. They buy a 20 acre estate out in the country, and dabble in a semi-rural farm type life. Oh yeah, he's also got an anxiety disorder. And big Rothy devotes his considerable literary abilities to describing a lifetimes worth of neuroses.His wife cheats on him, and his daughter's a psycho. I think he has an affair too somewhere along the way, and he likes to eat spaghetti at an Italian joint in midtown after catching a show. But it's mostly about this dudes anxieties. Phil's tremendous skills make this a pleasant book, and despite the mundane suburbanality, I actually didn't yawn once. Quite an impressive accomplishment, all things considered. Still an overrated book."
2,"simple, idyllic life","Ok, I admit I had to do a dictionary search on the word ""pastoral."" I was hoping that if I understood what the title was trying to betray that it would be more likely that I would understand the point of the book. So, ""pastoral"" is referring to a simple, idyllic life. I gather then that Roth is trying to show a contradiction of the view of American life as simple and idyllic. I get it, but why was the book so uninteresting. Maybe the contradiction was not strong enough. I believe the problem stems from the fact that the story really doesn't have a plot, so we are rolling around where there is no real conflict point or destination to our reading. If I got the point in a simple dictionary search and that point was not expanded by the story then all I needed from this book was the cover. The cover is pretty cool so I will give it 5 stars, too bad the story got in the middle of it."
3,"Interesting plot, but somewhat overindulgent","Roth's general plotline is extremely thought-provoking and interesting - the Swede and his antagonistic, fanatical daughter; his ruminations on what along the way has caused her to be the way she is. When the above was part of the story, I was compelled to read. However, the other 3/4 of the book strike me as self-indulgent passages Roth included simply to show just how well he thinks he writes, and how all-inclusive his research and knowledge can be. These passages often trudge along slowly and take the reader away from the main plot at hand. This could have been a 5-star, very disturbing, fascinating study, which at times it is - but altogether, it walks the line between the aforementioned to being a pompous bore."
5,A materpiece!,"I loved this book. Roth had become so hard to read in recent years that I was reluctant to pick this up but I found it as enjoyable as anything he has ever done. A pentrating look into the lives of my father's generation, men of limitless ambition but limited abilities. It chilled me to the bone. It said so much about being Jewish in America in the 20th century and about being american post world war 2 that it should be required reading in college history classes. Of course, it is written in the typical roth prose, shining like a gem throghout. I recommend this to everyone I know and even though it was slow in parts -- why is that such a crime? isn't real life slow in parts, too? -- i was very sorry when it ended. Mazeltov to Roth but this is a book for non-jews as well. The Swede is one of the great characters of modern american fiction. fantastic"
3,"A long, long journey","I admit that not being an American might exclude me from fully getting out of the book what Philip Roth put into it. Closing in on the last page, what remains in my mind is an epic story about a family and America in general, that drags on and on, that is so long that one could have cut out half of the pages and still would remember it as broad. Despite these drawbacks, Philip Roth's writing kept me reading on, curious to find out why the main character's daughter became a terrorist, what the root cause was that derailed this ""American dream"" family. Having finsihed the book, I am still wondering."
2,Wandering mess,"First up I did not like this, it is probably the most boring thing I have ever had the misfortune to happen on. Also, and forgive me for this, I read only half and therefore may not be entitled to comment. The story could be interesting, if you can find it in the flow of verbage. I gave 2 stars because the writing is excellent and if you like literary rambling then you may well enjoy. I read to be entertained , this did not entertain me. The author indulges in long diversions and it can take pages after pages just to add one thought to the story. It has lots of reviews so no point in my rehashing the plot - and in the interests of brevity I will keep this succinct. This is a book to me that is over written, one that will satisfy the intellectuals with lots of fodder for interpretation, discussion and general cleverness. But I was bored, perhaps I am too dumb. But I am too old to let that bother me anymore."
3,Pulitzer?,"The characterization in this book is admirable, but it flounders in the plot and narrative departments. Much time is spent in pondering ontological and deterministic questions, as well as explaining in great detail the intricacies of glove-making. Roth dwells on the emotional inner torment of his characters to an almost maudlin degree.It's not a terrible book by any stretch, but I have a difficult time believing there was none better in 1998, and it certainly isn't among his strongest. Anyone disappointed by this novel should try Ghost Writer, which is more compact and substantial, without so much self-indulgence in suburban philosophy. Roth is still a great writer here, it simply feels as if he begins coasting near the halfway point, and the book floats on from there to its stultifying conclusion."
2,this was a failure,"unlike his other books this one just did not hold the same poise as the others, it is a slow read and by the end the reader is so bored that they resent even reading it, i dont think anyone should read unless they need some good sleep"
2,"let's be honest, utterly brutal","Let's cut to the chase: this novel is grindingly tedious, despite disappearing Reviewer Maitland's protestations to the contrary. By page 150, you'll have a headache. I liked The Plot Against America a lot, and came to American Pastoral curious and highly receptive. But I'm sorry, this novel, after opening promisingly, came thudding to a near halt. (Reviewer PS, June 28. 2005, on this point, is required reading.) My wife needed to revive me with smelling salts about a third of the way through, and I promised her I'd give the book up despite a masochistic compulsion to complete it. Reviewer Maitland excoriated me in a prior, condescending review (since withdrawn, suspicously) for calling Roth ""prolix,"" but Roth is ""prolix,"" he needs an editor, but not as desperately as Reviewer Maitland does."
2,One Long Whine,"Phillip Roth is my literary Dick Nixon: the man I love to hate. Whoever it is, the real author or the persona, the guy keeps dragging me in to hear his agonized, self-involved, masturbatory whining, book after book after book.""American Pastoral"" purports to be a step away from all that. Roth's alter ego, Zuckerman, makes his entrance, and then relinquishes the stage to yet another Jewish main man from Newark, but one who, believe it or not, is a star athlete with blond hair, known to one and all as ""Swede."" But, wouldn't you know it, you can't take the neighborhood from the boy. Although punctuated by by a string of gratuitous crises, ""American Pastoral"" is basically one long whine.The maddening fact remains that Roth is a fine writer. And he even puts this talent to good use with his loving and detailed descriptions of the golden age of glovemaking. He should have written an essay or novella on this subject and skipped the rest of the Swede's sorry life."
2,much to much introspection,"I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters. He goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for ""the swede"", without letting us know who the Swede really is. Roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration.It gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. I loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times."
4,We grow old.,Why does every book that wins the Pulitzer make me feel like my life is useless? I guess they know the truth ... We are as insignificant as ants and as doomed as day old fruit flies.
1,I Agree - It Stinks - What's all the Acclaim About?,"This book was a total waste of time. It was hard to tell whether this guy was daydreaming or something was really happening. I read it to the bitter end, thinking there had to be some point - but I was wrong. What a sad, sad story and what a total waste of time."
3,"Blah, blah, blah...too many tangents","The sad this about this book is that is has so much potential. What a compelling story it COULD have been: the perfect, all-american family and how it deals with a terrorist daughter. Yet, Roth insists on just skimming the surface of this issue, and fills in the cracks with tangent upon tangent. He's just too long-winded for my taste. Example: I honestly didn't think I could get through the first 100 pages, where a childhood acquaintance recounts just how wonderful the main character (the ""Swede"") was in high school. One would think a writer would run out of ways to say ""he was popular and athletic"". But Roth takes 100 pages to say this! I'm not exaggerating! He just repeats himself OVER and OVER."
1,American Pastoral- Book on tape,"While the novel is extremely well written, it drones on and on and in the end is very disappointing. We have to sift through many ideas and counter ideas but never learn what happens! Who was Rita Cohen? He goes on and on about her- yet we stay mistified. What happens to Merry? Does she die of starvation? Does she go to jail? We don't know. What about his life after Dawn? The plot is very thin and the commentary about american life is very thick. I didn't disagree with any of his ideas but instead thought, ""so what""? In this story it seemed that the problems of the United States caused the problems of the hero. Not believable. Here is what we come away with: Mr. Roth is very bitter about the United States. Voila. Dull!"
4,Compelling,"Compelling, even if the author's penchant for too much detail at times slows the pace down. In the end you come away with the satisfaction of reading a really good book.Venkat"
1,Absolute Redundant Torture,"I've always been slightly sceptical about Philip Roth, but now I am outright repulsed by him. Every book he writes reiterates the same old cliched themes, and ""American Pastoral"" does this with particularly annoying aplomb. While reading this book, not only do you not give a fig about Swede Levov, you almost want to follow the example of his radical daughter, Merry, and blow off a bomb just to wake yourself up. If you need to read a Roth, try Henry instead."
2,Successful guy made miserable by his daughter,"Title of my review says it all. Not engaging in the least. Realistic? Sure. So realistic it's just as entertaining as watching your friends go through a custody battle. Yes, it's well written. But for a book to have value to me I either have to learn something or it has to be be a diversion. This book fails on both."
2,Interesting but lacking,"I just finished this. To me it started quite badly, too much dialog by a person not really connected to the plot.Then it kicks off properly after about 80 pages or so and focuses on the main character the Swede.Some of the insights into the Swede were interesting but there are loose ends and long generally dull sections particularly towards the end.It is one big post mortem really, even within the context of the story, the story itself is imaginary. Just a bit of nothing really.It kinda of is worth reading, the psychology is very detailed, and some times I felt like I was reading a new level of novel. But overall to me it didn't quite do it.I guess it was just too subtle for me... or was it 'silk so fine human eyes cannot see it...'"
3,Roth's Best Work,"This is a decent read, but generally I am not a fan of Roth's work. Overall, this is too inside-baseball with lots of meandering, endless sentences."
1,Fake and farfetched,"Roth is still a great prose stylist. And the passages on Newark were brilliant. But for a historical novel, the history is way off. The radicalism is cartoonish or worse. Other writers have tackled this fascinating subject (the 60's radicals and what became of them) and done a much better job - Marge Piercy, for one."
2,american pastoral is difficult. may not finishNone,full of detailed prose and changes directions every two pages. the idea is about the fight between our internal and cultural beliefs vs. what is considered fundamental to succes by societys norms. love the idea but so poorly executed by extraneous detail it is frustrating and causes lack of desire to continue.
2,Overrated,"I've read most of Philip Roth's novels but not in order of publication. I came to this one late and find it hard to understand why it received so much praise. The writing is overblown and pompous. The allegorical drive to make the characters stand for the underside and disillusionment of America in the 1960s means that the characters collapse under the weight of everything they're supposed to symbolize. All the female characters are monsters -- that's the word the narrator and characters use over and over again -- but not interesting monsters. And we learn far more than we need to do about the details of glove manufacturing. There are definitely some interesting ideas here, but the book never comes together as a fully realized, well-crafted novel. If you want to read mainstream Roth, I recommend giving this one a miss and reading THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA, or better yet, pick up ZUCKERMAN UNBOUND, an unsung masterpiece."
3,Unpopular kid gets to take apart the football star,"This book is about Swede Levov, the star of a high school in Newark. The first 125 pages is an excellent book, as Swede contacts the author for a meeting, and our narrator offers observations and speculates about Swede's life. Fine and good, maybe no Pulitzer, but a nice read. Then many bad things happen to Swede, far out of any real relation to reality, and we realize the author's agenda. In real life, he would be afraid of the Swede, a big, imposing guy. In this book as an author, he controls the character, and has the ability to inflict great cruelties upon him, and the book takes on an unreal aura midway through the book. Swede's daughter, a hippie, takes upon an unreal persona too. Books like a delicate balance deserve these prizes, this is a good book which deteriorates."
3,Powerful and painful,"It's a challenge to know how to rate this novel. As a work of literature, it's superb - Roth's prose is mesmeric as always and the exposition of a man's mental anguish feels convincing and haunting. As a novel I read for entertainment, I found it less satisfying, to the extent that I couldn't finish it.As Roth as Zuckerman imagines his way inside the Swede's head, the reader spends the majority of the book looking at the world through the Swede's eyes. Just as the Swede is compelled to revisit time and time again the events that led up to Merry's devastating actions and the subsequent years, so the reader is compelled to share his mental anguish. Whilst this is powerfully and restrainedly told, it does not make for an easy read emotionally."
2,A Weary Read,"I actually chose NOT to finish this book after plodding my way through over half of it. Discussions with about 10 other people provided the same responses. Only 2 actually finished it and adviced me not to bother. I tried to force my way through it, but...life's too short. There are too many great books calling my name."
2,Nathan Zuckerman asleep,"The action is all over the place, thin and stretched out between glove making and raising bull. The Swede's daughter's curriculum vitae just simply does not make sense. And why all these hebraeic asides, if they have nothing to do with the story? This book is not really well thought out"
1,Stream of consciousness drivel,I finished this book and I'm not proud of it. The repetitive nonsense hammered over and over never is justified by any resolution. Why start the book with Zuckerman only to drop him? How dissatisfying to learn about so many characters with no resolution of any conflict. The story is told from the point of view of the Swede's obsessed mind. Are we to believe that he recovers and starts a new (normal) family. What a waste of time.
3,Familiarity Breeds Contempt,"I found this book more and more difficult to read as it progressed. Too much time spent inside the Swede's head sharing his doubts and questions. At about the 3/4 mark, I was finding myself becoming impatient and annoyed with the main character. So much so, that when his brother unleashes a verbal tirade on him about his lack of a backbone, I was in total agreement. I was hoping that exchange was going to lead to some kind of action by the Swede, but he just chalked it up to jealousy on his brothers part, because everybody loves the Swede. He even began to repeat himself and it became like listening to a relative telling a story you've heard before.As for the supporting characters, I found his wife Dawn to be shallow and unlikable and his father to be a bit overbearing. The most interesting characters, his daughter Merry and his nemesis Rita Cohen, were simply not given the development that would have made this a much richer reading experience."
2,"Ideas/Themes are there, poorly executed, poor standard for Pulitzer","Unbelievable that this would win a prize, let alone the Pulitzer. Quality in modern writing is just not there, I couldn't imagine such poor quality being published years ago.The idea and theme were excellent and should have produced a wonderful novel. I found though this was poorly written, it was like the author didn't want to work at it and thought he could get away with it - at times it was rambling. Characters were poorly drawn, most notably Merry."
3,Zuckerman The Omniscient?,"American Pastoral was only the second Phillip Roth book for me (the first one being Portnoy's Complaint) so I was not familiar with the Zuckerman character. During the book's first 89 pages Zuckerman struck me as broadly entertaining, intellegent and provocative The problem is that he disappears after page 89 and never returns in the novel's 423 pages. The problem here, other that introducing an interesting character only to quickly dismiss him, is that what happens after page 89 is purported to be Zuckerman's rendition of the life of the Sweed, including the Sweed's innermost thoughts about everything. After page 89 the novel is written from the point of view of an omniscient third party and yet the first 89 pages essentially justify why Zuckerman chooses to write about the Sweed. I realize fiction sometimes requires a suspension of disbelief but this is too much. It's irritating and unnecessariy. Zuckerman is superfluous to the Sweed's story."
2,Kindle Edition: Almost Unreadable,"I'm an author and an acolyte for e-books. This is the most poorly converted text I've ever read on a Kindle. ""They'll"" is often rendered as ""They 11"", ""It's"" as ""It ¿5"". Paragraph breaks are missing, words are mis-transliterated (""oi"" for ""of"" ""sevens-five"" for seventy-five, ""lite"" for ""life."" Sentences end in the middle and pick up who knows how many words, paragraphs, or pages later? Comically, the book's title is randomly inserted into at least two sentences: ""But he could not see how even the coldest calculation could help american pastoral him here."" ""In the few american pastoral moments I spent with him in my life, I felt better about myself..."" I'm pretty sure that's not how Roth wrote it.And this is not isolated. There are examples on almost every page. Great book. Do NOT get the Kindle edition."
1,Self-indulgent twaddle,"Philip Roth takes a very dull character, ""Swede"" Levov and spends a few hundred pages introducing him and his dull life. Something interesting happens which sends the Swede into a tailspin, to the extent that he almost shows some emotion. Roth spends the rest of the book juxtaposing the Swede's heartache with many flashbacks of his previously dull life. Waaaay too many flashbacks. Who enjoys a book like this? It's a mystery to me."
1,This book was annoying.,"This book's writing style was tedious--a very poorly written book as far as I'm concerned. The sentences were unnecessarily packed--often 10 and 12 lines long--and the 2- and 3-page wanderings between lines of dialog were maddening. I had the feeling I was following someone who didn't really know where he was going or why. The book club I go to gave it 9 thumbs down and only 1 thumbs up. I read Portnoy's Complaint when it first came out years ago and didn't like it either, and this current book reminded me of it despite the almost 30 intervening years. It was my book club's consensus that this would be our last Roth selection. I am dumbfounded as to how a book like this could win a Pulitzer Prize. What do they use for criteria? Surely not writing technique."
5,There is no answer,"Every parent on their own mini level confronts that moment when they see their child's behavior and question, hey I am a good person, why is this kid not the glowing image of who I think I am, a me always on my best behavior. Merry is that worst nightmare come true, a child that harbors the ""alien"" monster we all fear our childrearing will create. She is a child of the time , the sixties, and a child of the pefect incubator, mis wired. American Pastoral was disturbing, but powerful. Read it."
3,"Subtle and symbolic, but not Roth's best","_American Pastoral_ may be a touch slow, even for Roth, but the powerful language and sweeping imagery of the work prove that it merits the commendation it has won. However, those who read _Pastoral_ as I have may wonder what happened to the vibrancy and sharp brilliance Roth displayed in his premiere work, _Goodbye, Columbus_.There do exist lines connecting _Pastoral_ to _Columbus_, specifically Roth's questions about religion's incarnation in flesh, and the misdirection of youth. However, _Pastoral_ reacts more slowly and more simply to the questions which tore wildly through _Columbus_. Although Roth tries to resolve these principal issues, he does not approach the success of his first work, which leaves them necessarily unresolved and unresolvable."
2,What have I missed?,"Frankly, the first book I read by Mr. Roth, The Great American Novel, about 25 years ago, was my last. . . until I gave him a reprieve with American Pastoral. The reason why I decided to read this one was based on the reviews by the so-called experts. I wish I had had more faith in my instincts. I was just as bored this time around as the first. Then again, what have I missed? Someone(s) must think very highly of this work to award Mr. Roth a Pulitzer."
2,Extremely poor conversion to Kindle format,"This is absolutely the worst edited/formatted Kindle book I have read. It was clearly converted with OCR and then not edited by hand. There are an enormous number of errors in the text (wrong letter, mispunctuation, numbers instead of letters), possibly working out to one per page, but there are a couple sections where I was so frustrated that I almost stopped reading the book. Most of them are minor errors, but sometimes it seems like entire words are missing. Regardless, it's an unacceptable number for a professionally released product from the publisher."
3,100 Words or Less,"No author can deconstruct a character like Roth.Yet, this doesn't come without its own inherent problems. So much of his narrative has little to do with the moment, but primarily peels back the layers of the past. This constant digging with Roth is like picking at a scab. Sooner or later, there will be blood.American Pastoral carries both the glory and pitfalls of his technique. There are some great passages - pure written beauty. However, the novel's constant microscopic examination of every character nuance wears away at you. Halfway through and it's exhausting to, once again, delve into the minutia of past tragedies.It's amazing writing. It's also numbing."
5,Thanksgiving,"Roth's takes its place in the canon of novels about Vietnam, and the social derangement across the lines of class which accompanied it in America. Perhaps the recent NYT best of the past 25 years panel had it right about this book. Unlike some other Zuckerman narrations, Roth's imagination fully inhabits Swede Levov within his componential personality, politics, philosophy and family. There were times when I wanted to grab and choke one character or another, perhaps Philip, a former professor of mine, himself -- ""a gripping read."""
2,Exploitative,"This certainly is a prime example of brilliant manipulative rhetoric by the author, well executed for maximum readerly affect. In some respects thouroughly reprehensible, though. (I do not expect to get a positive response from this review, but that's okay)."
1,Boring,"This book is too old, too male, too white and too long... It examines in excrutiating detail all trivial issues and neglects the interesting and important ones. The story goes nowhere fast and keeps sinking after you've finished."
1,it stinks!!!,"This story and character is too old, too white and too male... It doesn't go anywhere, but down... Leaving out the good parts and ruminating over the trivial parts of the main character's life, the book was a train going nowhere..."
2,another geezer's ramblings,"Pieces of it are okay--it might even contain the makings of a few short stories--but taken as a whole, it's meandering, repetitive and just plain boring.I'm part way into it and suspect it's never going to get to the point, so I don't intend to finish it."
2,Disappointment,"I so, so so much wanted to like this book, and find something profound within it. But I didn't. poor old Swede. poor fellow me. What a humbug. Even the radicalness of his daughter was humbug. Or is that the point and I missed it? I find Roth's writing boring and self-absorbed. And condescending towards the working class, as depicted in the glove factory employees. A man without empathy is the voice I hear from this author.Still looking for the Great American Novel...."
2,"Great, perhaps, for English majors, but boring for my bookclub.","American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good. But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her."
4,Definitely not one of his lighter offerings,"I didn't just read this book - I felt that I actually lived it too. I was so caught up in ""The Swede's"" great life turned horribly bad that it was a real relief when it was over! Roth saturates you into his life with all of the minute details he can render - and still leaves many, many questions unanswered. I agree with someone who said the Swede's life is a symbol of America in the 50s and 60s and how things changed so drastically. The writing was a little difficult to keep pace with - it's pretty dense and I felt quite repititious, especially when telling about Swede's state of mind after the bombing. I would have liked to know a little more about what happened in between Swede's two lives - but I guess that was not the point of the book. Recommended but know before going in that it's not light reading and Roth uses almost none of his wonderful humor in this one."
5,Hands down best scraper blade,"I have used this razor sharp blade to scrape old adhesive, vinyl composition tiles, paint, and even rust. I thought that the very very sharp blade would dull to a working edge and may need a touch up occasionally, but to my surprise, it is still incredibly sharp. The edge holding up this long under such abuse is a testament to the quality of the steel its made from. I wish my chisels were as good."
4,Great Collection ... But.....,"Let me say i have been a Deftones fan from the very start. I have every album and love seeing them live.. I think this is a good collection but i have had ALMOST every one of these songs on my computer for a longgg time.. and when i saw the track listing i was really hoping for them to either re-do them in the studio or remaster them,(I.E. Be Quiet and Drive Acoustic). I havent watched the DVD yet but u can get the deftones videos anywhere, granted theres little tid bits in between.. i was hoping for some live songs. Lastly theres some good songs missing i wish they would have included: Like everyone before said ""To Have And To Hold"" and ""Lovers"", but also my favorite cover they do: Weezer's Say It Aint So.So i give the tones cd 4 stars but i think it could have been a little better. Its too boot-leggy for the money, but still a definite must have for any REAL deftones fanCANT WAIT FOR THE NEW ALBUM!!!!!!"
2,I want my $18 back.,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a Deftones fan and when I saw this CD/DVD out I jumped on it, but what I'm not a fan of is acoustic versions of really great heavy songs. They seem to lose something in the process. I skipped through the CD pretty quick on the way home with nothing really catching my attention. I figured the DVD would be better with the original videos of songs I really like, but I forgot that the Deftones' videos aren't that great. Take ""Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)"" for instance. Song is great, but dancing around with a hose under a bridge or whatever it is they're under is not great. Die hard Deftones fans will probably like this CD/DVD, but I felt is was lacking."
3,It's not bad,The CD is a must have for any hardcore fan. The songs that stick out the most and hardcore are Sinatra and Wax and Wane. The other songs are cool and I am glad that I finally got them in my catalog.
4,worth having but not great,"The track ""Crenshaw Punch"" is awesome, and the cover of ""The Chauffeur"" (Duran Duran) is great. ""Wax and Wane"" (Cocteau Twins) is good also. ""Black Moon"" with B-Real is pretty cool. I'm a huge Deftones fan, but I think the acoustic tracks suck. But the remaining cover songs are decent."
4,B-sides and covers leave a bit to be desired,"let me first say that this band has always been a sort of hit-or-miss type group; the stuff that they do that's good is usually downright amazing, however, they occasionally have a huge mis-step that can be downright embarassing. typically, their covers have always been good (and good choices of songs to cover as well), and the cover of ""savory"" by early '90s post-hardcore stalwarts jawbox, as well as helmet's ""sinatra"" and the smiths' ""please let me get what i want"" all stick out, as well as ""no ordinary love"" by sade which might seem to be completely out of left field to your average nu-metal fan. however, some of these cuts suffer from poor production (perhaps a re-mastering of some of these works would have been a good idea). overall, a decent stopgap release before they complete work on their next record, however, i wouldn't put this record in the 'essential' category for anyone but big deftones fans."
3,Some ado about not all that much,"As for the covers, well, I was a huge fan prior to ""Deftones"" so I had heard them all before. I'll be honest, I hated the direction the Deftones took with ""Deftones."" So ""Sinatra"" is one particular track I could have lived without. Would I pay full price for all of them? Not so much. Buy used if possible, is my advice. The videos are alright. Worth the full $23 though? Again, no. Granted, this was all much higher quality than any other Deftones media I had prior to ""B-Sides..."" release, but I didn't feel anything stood out that much to make this a worthwhile album, DVD or not.Definitely not a good purchase for a casual listener. Want some Deftones? Adrenaline, Around the Fur, and White Pony are all amazing."
5,YES!,"First of all, I watched the DVD about 10 times. I love it... I just wish there was more. But not in a way that leaves me feeling unsatisfied but in a ""I just can't get enough of the Deftones"" way. All their vids are on there plus some goofing around behind the scenes sillyness which are my favorite parts.Second, if you're a HUGE 'Tones fan, you'll love the album just as much as the DVD. If you like the 'Tones but aren't completely insane about them than you might (might being the key word) not dig this album since it doesn't really have the type of sound the Deftones are known for. It's a little more mellow than what one would expect from these guys.I love having this in my collection for a few reasons: One, I'm a tried and true, die hard Deftones fan. Two, it proves quite well that they can totally pull off covering songs that aren't their typical ""style"" and three, it's just a good cd that I don't get tired of listening to."
4,worth buying.,"well when i first saw the commercial advertising this cd/dvd complete with unreleased tracks and every one of the Deftones' music videos, i was quite exited.upon buying it and listening to the cd, i did expect a little more but i can say that it was worth buying. the songs that stood out to me the most on the cd would have to be the Helmet cover, The Cure cover, the acoustic version of Be Quiet and Drive and No Ordinary Love, which is flawless.the dvd is awesome. it has the Deftones video collection plus a live video for Root. i do wish there could have been more interviews and live performances, but i can't complain. its definetly worth the money and a must have for any Deftones fan."
5,Give it some time,"Just like every Deftones CD, you don't really get into it at first, you have to listen to it and let it grow on you. At first I wasn't really thrilled about this CD, but now that I've actually listened to it over and over, I love it. Very different from most Deftones discs, and not as heavy, but still great. No Deftones CD is alike, so that's normal. The only songs that I wish would have been on here is ""The Boys Republic"" and ""Lovers"". The DVD is kind of a letdown, only videos and a little bit of random in between video stuff. I was hoping for some Deftones commentary and live performances and stuff. And most Deftones videos aren't that interesting. But anyways, the CD is great, but I really wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't a fan of the Deftones. Start with the actual CD's first."
2,"Remember Buddy, not This Book","While the concept of what the subject of the book was about is failry simple, the hodge-podge approach and style still detracted from the overall message. If this is the only book one reads about the day the music died, then the music will be dead because this book does nothing to enhance the memory of the never-to-be forgotten trio."
4,comes in handy,"As others have stated, this dictionary is geared towards English speakers and is not bilingual. It is hardcover, short in size but very thick with an extensive amount of vocabulary. However, I discovered a few modern day words such as cell phone, email and Internet missing. Those words are contained in a smaller, Berlitz dictionary I also own. Since the words are not color coded like the Berlitz, they tend to run together making it more difficult to follow. In language dictionaries, it is difficult to find one perfect version so this is a handy addition."
4,The Owner of the House by Louis Simpson,"This work contains many themes about life, pogroms, immigrants,the homeless and occasionally theology. Here are some samples.""To the north (Mauka)a mass of rosy cloudstwo slopes of a mountainsprinkled with garden lights. (Kaimana Beach)or""Beside a Church we dug our holes,By tombstone and by crossThey were too shallow for our soulsWhen the ground began to toss. ""The readings make for an entertaining session. This poetryis light-hearted but it is not elegant in the style ofan Evangeline or Edgar Allen Poe work."
5,Price and product,"Great deal for a mid-level laptop, great for school, trips(watch DVDs/play games) and nice to have the 80 gigs for my itunes libary."
1,Keyboard problems,"This system has a ""chiclet style"" keyboard with small plastic shells attached on top of the key mechanisms. On my system, several keytops had a nasty habit of falling off. They are not easy to attach back on the keyboard, and eventually will not attach at all.I called HP customer service. They offered to bring the computer back in for service, replace/repair the keys, then send the computer back to me. Since I had purchased the computer in anticipation of a rather long overseas trip, there was no time for the suggested repair procedure. No alternatives were available for a faster replacement.The warranty covers the US only. I would have to pay for any repairs performed outside the US.This became an expensive lesson on avoiding supposedly ""brand name quality""."
5,My NIK is Sealed,I came across this product years ago and would not use anything else. It does a magnificaent job on those minor razor nicks that we seem unable to avoid. I thoroughly recommend this product
5,Good bottle,"Very durable well made, handles a lot of abuse and rolls up small. have had 2 so far and will probably buy more. water is very important in the woods, and having something to carry it in that gets small in the pack when not in use is very handy"
3,"Yes, I lost the cap","The best thing about this product is the price you pay for a large, transportable water container. Where products like camelbak can be horrifyingly overpriced, you can purchase this guy and put it in a back pack.It's also quite durable, I've filled it with water and dropped it onto the floor from several feet above and it just won't bust, it's clearly made to last.However, the most troubling thing about this product is really the mouth piece. It's tiny, and therefore hard to fill and clean. I'm not sure who imagined that having a small opening for a water container would be practical but it clearly isn't. To tell you the truth I wouldn't even consider buying a second one unless that was changed. Oh, and maybe if it had a handle, that be great too.In the meantime this product does serve it's purpose, I have taken this thing around everywhere and it does well, it's durability does surprise me."
5,EXCELLENT for cruises!!,I used two of these recently when my wife and I went on a cruise. They packed very well and were undetected by security on the ship. It saved us tons of money on alcohol and I imagine it would have been quite easy to refill them off the ship and sneak back on if we needed too. The cap is very well made and the plastic on the bag is heavy duty. Good purchase overall if you are looking to take a large volume of liquid somewhere.
4,Best for Camping,"Product is light and packable, but isn't great for daily use in non-camping settings, as it's easy to spill more out than desired due to the softness of the container."
4,Great Water Bladder!!,This is a great water bottle/bladder!!! It can hold a liter of water and folds up into a small bundle after use. You can clean it by putting a little water in and shaking the thing like crazy. Great overall.
5,Perfect for when you don't want a regular water bottle,I bought these as a backup supply for backcountry snowboarding in case I finish off my camelback. I got the .5 and 1l sizes. Ended up using one or the other for a wine stash to fight the cold off a little bit. Also works great for taking beverages into events that frown upon that.
5,Great,"I've gotten exactly what I wanted- A container that will hold enough water to re-fill my hydration pack when I'm in the field, but won't take up a ton of room once it's empty. Definitely more lightweight and space-saving than toting a few of my metal water bottles around with me."
5,Platy Puss !!! Awesome Bottle!!!,This is a Great Water Bottle!!! I use it everyday!!! I freeze half & then fill the rest.. Nice how it folds when empty... highly recommended!
4,"Great bottle, poorly packaged","I ordered two of these bottles for my husband and I to stick in our bags when we travel. They are great - this is the kind of simple, clever, useful product that makes you say, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" The only problem I had with them is that the packaging (the manufacturer's, not Amazon's) doesn't cover or secure the cap of the bottle at all, and one of ours arrived without a cap. Presumably it just came unscrewed somewhere along the way and fell off. Fortunately we found that the cap of a standard disposable water bottle will fit this bottle, so it's no big deal, just annoying to pay money for an item and have it arrive missing a part due to poorly designed packaging."
4,Very Cool,"This is a sturdy, soft bottle. It has a large enough mouth to get water without having to 'squirt' it. It's only drawback is that's it is too big for my pocket."
2,Hard to use,This is really hard to drink from. It's very floppy and takes two hands to drink it. It's great to have as a backup to stick in your bag to fill later but it's not ideal for everyday use.
3,Water bottle,"I bought this mainly because it becomes flat when it's empty. Makes storing easy. However, I wish I had bought a larger bottle."
2,Lost the cap,I lost the cap first time I washed it. It's a nondescript thing like all other plastic caps--probably tossed in the garbage.It is tricky to wash and dry. It takes about two days to air dry the bag. Bear in mind it takes two hands to use because it is not rigid--you can't use it while biking or driving.
2,Lost the cap,I used the bottle once and washed it--and the little nondescript cap got lost--probably tossed in the trash like all other plastic caps. A replacement is $3.00 plus shipping. It's also tricky to wash and air dry--hard to get a bag dry inside.
4,A good water bottle,I've been pleased that the water in my Platypus doesn't seem to acquire the taste of the plastic as it does with some water bottles. It's also nice that it only takes up as much space as the water inside it. The one downside is that the flexibility does make it prone to spilling at times.
4,Great for vacation,"I bought this bottle to use for a trip to Disney World. Worked great. Was nice that when I emptied it I could just fold or roll it up and keep it easily in my pocket. A little hard to file until you get used to it, but that is to be expected some given the soft collapsable (which is why I like it for travel purposes)."
1,It Leaks,"It leaks. I returned it. I filled it with water when I received it, and laid it on the kitchen counter. Came back an hour later and the counter was soaked under the bottle from leaking water. Emptied it out, refilled it, and screwed the top on again really tight in case I hadn't done so the first time. Laid it on the counter. Came back later, and the counter was soaked again from leaking water."
2,not to bad,"I realy liked the compactness of it. the only problem, its not too sturdy, had a hole in it in 4 days on a camping/hiking/motorcycle trip. ended up having to throw it away. if your just using it for light duty (around the house or light hikes) its a great product. just not for other outdoors stuff."
2,cap broke first use,"The first time I filled my platypus up I screwed the cap on (not even tightly) the cap cracked in half. If you are going to use this bag to carry water reliably, look elsewhere. The cap is made of plastic that is thinner and more fragile than a 99 water bottle. The actual Platypus bag is made of decent material but without a sturdy cap its worthless."
2,pathetic excuse for a sheldon,This book can at best be described as a desperate attempt at a thriller . The plot is an old one - rich and mean business tycoon - hated by his children - dies in an accident - illegitimate daugheter turns up out of the blue and the rest is predictable .75 % of the novel is predicatble - unless someone has lived in a box for the past 25yrs !Totally disappointing !
2,Very dissapointed,"Having enjoyed so many of Sidney Sheldons' books, and always looking forward to reading his next one, I was dissapointed with Morning, Noon and Night.I actually felt ripped off, as the story was too short, it didn't hold any surprises, and it was too easy to figure out.I feel he didn't put much effort into this one, and hope he is going to get back to his good story-telling in his next book"
1,Not a very good book,"I could not believe that this book was as bad as it is. I firstthought it was me. Then I passed it around to a couple ofmy co-workers who are also avid readers. They could not evenfinish the book. To me there simple was no depth, suspensenor did he make the story interesting. He didn't even haveenough imagination to change his book cover. It looked simularto his last book. Did he mean to do this?? I think I will waitfor his next book to come in paperback."
2,A very disappointing read!,"The plot is intriguing and rather unpredictable, but the story line has no base and it could have been written by any one. The characterisation was hopeless. Compared to Catherine Douglas, Jennifer Parker, Kate Blackwell who are all strong characters, Julia Stanford was not worth reading about. Don't waste your time on this one!"
1,Incredibly BAD Writing,"This was my first read of anything by the alleged great Sidney Sheldon - and I was shocked at how poorly it was written. The entire time I was reading it, I felt like the author was racing to slap the words on a page and get it over with. This was especially true of the dialogue. It is laughingly, pathetically BAD. There is nothing about it that feels or sounds like how people actually talk to each other! It had a forced, rushed quality to it, like maybe the golf links were calling to the writer and he couldn't wait to get this assignment over and done with. The plot was predictable and trite and quite honestly, I'm amazed I stuck with this book until the end. I guess I kept hoping that it would improve - I mean, after all, the late great Sidney Sheldon's name is on it, right? But sadly no - no improvement ever came. It leaves me to wonder if he indeed had anything to do with its actual creation. I will be hard-pressed to want to ever read anything by him again."
3,A little disappointing,I've read many of Sidney Sheldon's books. This one was fine but not as good as most of his work.
4,Surprised,"I was surprised that there was no surprise! Usually Sheldon has that twist at the very end and I kept waiting for it to no avail. It did keep me turning pages, but I kept waiting for that shocker that didn't come. It is a fun, quick, read for those looking for a four hour getaway."
2,I want my Time back!,"How much can any one reader love an author with no sense of character development? They're plastered on the pages, little better than cardboard cut-outs. I'm to really believe Julia loves Steve because I'm told? Harry is a bad, bad man; thank you, Mr. Sheldon, for informing me (and sadly not showing). Furthermore, the author has little sense of environment and scenery. His landscapes are posters on the walls of travel agencies.Readers who enjoy a swiftly paced novel (the rapidity of the story line is Sid's strength) may enjoy the book for what it is. It's as if he took this good idea and, in his rush to present it, slacked off on the writing. The plot feels contrived, the characters vague, and the prose flavorless. This novel reads more like a first draft. Maybe, after some major revisions, I'll happily amend this statement to something more cheery."
2,sidney is slipping,"A quick read but no real surprises. I was amazed at the number of errors which got by e.g a ship does not get under ""weigh"", it's ""underway"". He also confused Back Bay with Beacon Hill - no Bostonian would make such an error. The writing resembled a sixth grader's - surely the old subject-predicate, subject -predicate style can be improved upon."
4,again and again,"I have read this book twice now, the first time in seven hours. I have read all but two of Sheldon's book (for now) I own or have easy access to the mini-series of Memories of Midnight, Windmills of the Gods, Rage of Angels, If Tomorrow comes and Master of the Game. Sheldon is one of my favorite authors and his books just fly by. I have read several of them three-four times. If you haven't read him...DO."
4,Very Good !,Very good story by a brilliant author. Mr. Sheldon's books always amazed me. His books are the best.
4,Finished in 41/2 straight hours!,I never once put this book down except to grab a bite to eat or to pee. I highly recommend this book to any one who likes to read. It will appeal to a wide range of people.
5,Wonderfully executed! A Machiavellian MasterPiece!,"Praise must be given to Sidney Sheldon for this. A superbly well-crafted and planned novel of greed, outrage, blackmail, romance, with the usual unexpected twists and turns so famous in his other works. He pinpoints several characters as the culprit, but then throws the reader in totally different directions, never losing track of the story's frantic rhythm. He alternates the quick pace of the suspense with a languid pace in the love scenes which makes this a superb read. I have just finished it for the fourth time today!"
2,What a mess!!,"I read this book when it first hit the shelves here in Australia (1995) and it should have stayed there. The plot is disordered, characterisation is non-existent, and there is no sense of finality. Is it my imagination, or is Sidney Sheldon homophobic? Besides ""Nothing Lasts Forever"", this is one of Sidney Sheldon's more forgettable creations."
3,Sid,I order all of Sidney Sheldon's books from your company for my son to read - he likes most all that he has out.
5,LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!!!,"Ever since I put my hands on ""Master Of The Game"" I couldn't get enough. This book was very interesting. Very shocking at the ending. I look forward to buying more of his novels."
4,"Enjoyable, Twisting Thriller..","A very quick reading mystery, with twists and turns and a surprising murderer. As I read all the reviews it seems people either really like this book or hate it. I really liked it. One of Mr. Sheldon's best in my opinion. If you like mysteries, give it a try."
4,"Good book, but not his best.","I thought this book was a good book but it certainly was a ways from his best. It just didn't have all the suspense as all the other books by Sheldon have had. I would certainly recommend Sheldon to everyone who enjoys suspense and suprise endings. I read this book in one night, and being 14, I don't do that very often."
5,it is very good written,"you know i like this story very much the story is a legend and this book is the latest sidney sheldon novel that has been published i like this book very very muchand i like the author too to sidneysheldon i want to say that you've write the book very well you are the best author in the world. i also read nothing lasts forever too and it is a good story too that's all if this message came to you i,m gonna beso happy ok bye bye"
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I read this book in less than 3 days, and I enjoyed every page. This is the story about a very rich man named Hary Stanford who dies a mysterious death by drowning. Seeing that he had children, he left them all an equal share of his billions of dollars. However, a woman named Julia shows up shortly after claiming to be a product of the affair between Harry and the housekeeper named Rosemary. The will states that each of his children will recieve an equal amount of his money, Julia is just as entitled to it.I don't want to go much further or else I'll spoil the plot, but I just want to say that this book reminds me of the movie Nurse Betty, because every event is more surprising and ironic as the last. It is a very exciting story which will keep you on the edge of your seat up to the last word."
3,It's okay,"Call me childish, but I find it much easier to feel confident about tackling a new recipe if there's pictures of the final product to compare to... or live up to. There are none in this book. a little dissapointing and maybe a bit overpriced."
2,"Long, involved recipes with expensive ingredients for relatively bland dishes","The visual presentation and descriptions in this cookbook are wonderful. Moreover, I liked a few of the recipes, such as the Mac n Cheese and the Monk's Curry, but I'm considerably less enthusiastic about the rest of the recipes that I've tried from Rebar. Most of them take very long to prepare and cook, and many of them first require preparation of a condiment or sauce. The results are somewhat blah for the most part. I've never made anything bad per se, but the time and money I put into the recipes is not worth the result."
5,one of the best,"We stumbled into the restaurant a few years ago and we were blown away by the food. We are meat eaters and this has become one of our favorite cookbooks. We have not found it difficult to use. Nothing has let us down and we are cooking from it tonight! Tuscan White Bean with rosemary and kale, simple and great."
5,Leadership is an Art,"This book was absolutely fantastic! As someone who is just getting into project management, I found this a most helpful and inspiring read! A must for everyone headed for a management or supervisory position. Don't wait for the movie!"
5,"Max De Pree is encouraging, thoughtful & inspiring","This book discussed topics such as all people have important values, experience, and ideas and should be the owners of their job and place of employment and corporations should respect and honor their different attributes. Other important topics include things such as roving leadership, servant leadership, diversity that goes beyond ethnicity or nationality to the spirit and soul of a person. Lastly, that leadership doesn't seek to control but to liberate. Every person that wants to be an effective and God honoring leader ought to read this book!"
3,Good not earthshaking,"While this book was good it was not earthshatteringly excellent. It some food for though, but nothing really new...mostly affirmations of what I already thought/felt/believed. A very quick read...I prefer things with more meat."
5,Leadership = DePree,My daughter needed this book for a class this semester. I found the book so interesting that I read it as well. It's a keeper!
3,Printed on a paper so lousy that you hardly can read the book,"De Pree's book is insightful.But: You can hardly hold it in your hands for more than five minutes, because the paper is so lousy: the pages are coarse and scratchy; the paper is thick. With only 150 pages the book is almost as fat as another book of 387 pages, printed on good paper (Hartley's Management Mistakes & Successes). DOUBLEDAY HAS PRODUCED A LOWEST-QUALITY-BOOK, HERE."
5,Smart!,"Do not let the size of this volume fool you. This is no ordinary small book. This book is pregnant with some of the most fascination working principles of leadership.There is something uncanny about this small book. I can't seem to put my hands on it. But I know that it is there, because I thoroughly enjoyed this small volume.5 stars and counting!"
4,Very inspiring and uplifting,"Thought provoking and inspiring. Against conventional wisdom but not beyond it. Max's management thoughts are not just revolutionary radical, he has proven that they work. He is not just a writer or worse a talker, he is a doer and if the world's institutions have more CEOs like him, this world's working place would be a much kinder and better place to serve in. One of the better books I have had read lately. The trouble is, I have been seaching high and low for a copy of the book in the local bookstores in Malaysia but found none (i borrowed it from the Singapore Airlines Ltd library). Plse tell me which of your local bookstore in Singapore and Malaysia carry it. Thks"
3,Basic Leadership,"Although this was a good read, and had a lot of great information, I think that it just skimmed the surface. This would be a good book for the beginner in management or leadership, but if you have already read anything on the subject this would mainly serve as only an affirmation to what you have already heard. DePree gives a lot of great testimonies to back up his information, and that helps make this an enjoyable read."
5,Great Book,This is a book that I have my students read in the Executive Leadership course I teach at the Art Institute of California - San Francisco. Inspirational.
2,Good for those who are lacking leadership knowlage.,"De Pree's ideas although radical to the novice I felt were a bit redundent in regards to various other books about business leadership. His book strikes me as a good book for a college student who's working on his/her business major, or any other person interested in the field of business leadership."
3,I Only Give It Three Stars,"As I was reading this book, I heard the author speaking to me and reading the words on the page. Unfortunatly, this author is not a good story teller. His sentences are short and undescriptive. Don't get me wrong, I understand that leadership is not the most exciting topic to write about; however, DePree didn't make it very exciting to read about either. DePree states in the introduction that, ""the book is not filled with anecdotes."" It is my experience that when a book does not include working examples of its main ideas,(other than examples within the company that the author works for) it becomes more of a textbook than an entertaining read. However, DePree seems to be a very intelligent man with many good insights into the aspects of leadership. In my personal opinion, the book is filled with intelligent thoughts about leadership, but could use a bit more ""color."""
3,Not my cup of tea,"Max Depree basic theme is that although there are leadership principles to be learned, there is a certain mysticism about leadership that is more tribal than scientific and more a weaving of relationships than a amassing of leadership.Depree talks about diversity, issues of the heart and spirit, integration, being vulnerable and empowerment, but he does so as a business man who realizes that the purpose of a business is to make a profit. Depree discovered that by taking care of his employees, and making them owners in the process he can achieve greater employee loyalty, more creativity, and hence, greater prophets. The danger is that non-businessman (i.e., politicians and pastors) will take these noble ideas and abdicate their leadership."
1,Avoid this book,"""Leadership is an Art"" is double-spaced, large type and only 148 pages long and yet it is so thin on content that it still feels like the author is struggling to fill the pages. The five pages of the introduction cover basically everything the author has to say while the rest of the book is filled with redundant anecdotes and pointless religious musing. The few actual points the author does make seem so common sense to me (treat the people who work for you with respect, what a concept) that it actually kind of disturbs me that so many people seem to find his ideas revolutionary."
5,A must have for Leadership Professionals,"Excellent book! quick and easy read, very informative, and very detailed. This is a must have for leadership professionals or people wanting to become better leaders."
3,Great concepts but thoretical in concept,This book concisely summarizes the traits required of good leaders. I felt that the style of writing was theoretical and difficult to understand in certain places. I recommend the book but not to a manager who is just starting out in his/her leadership career.
5,Compresive Database for Natural Medicines,"Wonderful and comprehensive database for anyone interested in natural/herbal medicines - includes dosage, allopathic drug interactions, side effects, food interactions etc. More complete than the ""PDR for herbal medicines"". Pro for PDR is that it has colored pictures of the herbs in the natural state. PDR, however, does not have homeopathic dosing and the ""Database"" does (but it is not a repetory). A good adjunct to Textbook of Natural Medicine. Also important for healthcare providers who have clients that use natural medicines and need to know interactions between what is being prescribed and what is already being used."
1,Felt Like A Rip Off,"I first saw this book at a friend's house. I picked it up and read the first story, ""forgotten blessings"". After reading it, I became eager to get a copy of this book so I can read the rest of the stories. When I purchased this book, I waited for night to come so I can snuggle up in my cozy bed and read some inspiring stories that will help me increase my faith. The second story was disappointing. I thought ""hey that's okay... just one bad story... I'll give the next one a chance."" Story after story, I became more disappointed yet still giving this book a chance. After reading the whole book, I came to the final conclusion that the book was a waste and displeasing. Of course they would put the best story in the beginning! Because the rest of the book is pointless."
1,Identifying Lies In Disguise,"I found this book rather hard going. The book itself is a disguise. It is really Statement Analysis in a heavy disguise.There is some merit, which could have filled 20 or less pages. The rest is obscure."
2,Uninspiring Garden Design Book,"I was quite uninspired by this book. I found the title to be quite misleading, as the gardens depicted in the book were mostly close ups of plants, or vignettes, and very few garden ""rooms."" There are no design layouts illlustrated, nor photos of a garden as a whole to give you an idea of how it was divided into outdoor rooms. The book is primarily text, with one or two large photos per chapter - - not enough to illustrate the concept being discussed. I am a visual person and look at garden books for inspiration. I needed more photographs, less information on how to decorate my dining room table or how to do bonsai. It wasn't what I expected or hoped for in a book about creating stylish outdoor rooms."
4,Barber's concerto is very interesting!,"I always love to hear Hilary's album because her performance is very cool and her albums are very interesting album: Bach for the debut album, Beethoven and Bernstein for the second one, and now, this one. I enjoy each of them very much. It's very interesting and wonderful for me to hear two concertos by Barber and Meyer. It's very stylish and beautiful. I prefer Berber to Meyer because the latter one cecomed dull at the second movement. I recommend it highly to everyone who want to hear one of the greatest violinists of the 21st Century. Hilary's tone is very softly and a rather tight, compared with that of Leila Josefowicz. Liela's tone is bery vividly and dramatic.Recommend! Enjoy!"
1,Georgia on my mind,"I had a hard time getting through this one, especially the Barber. They say some Classical music takes getting used to. I think that's an excuse for bad composers to proliferate their high school quality doodlings. (My first exposure to the WTC was instantaneous joy, for a not example.) Not only is this number hard to digest, but the unfelt mechanistic imprudence radiating from your speakers will have you disgusted that a permanent recording of it was mass produced. Of course, thus goes the entertainment industry. Although Hilary is proud of her first commissioned work, I find the Barber in the quintessential vein of prime time television saga themes. Maybe she'll sign it over to Hollywood in the years to come. Personally, I heard of some recent developments in a Russian robotics lab where they were playing Bach with an actual bow to millisecond accuracy. Sign me up for one of those. Hilary is already getting old."
4,Very Enjoyable,The Barber Violin Concerto is not a great piece of music but it is a very fine one. Its heightened romanticism takes full advantage of the lyricism inherent in good string playing. Some parts of the second movement are just lovely. This is a fine recording featuring the very talented Hilary Hahn.
4,not as good as Joshua Bell's Barber,"There is no doubt in the fact that Hilary Hahn is something extraordinary when it comes to technique and sound quality. However, even though Joshua Bell's tone might be descrbed as somehwat lusher, it still has that recognizable human voice, of which its being imperfect, makes it perfect. Although i found the CD to be absoulutley amusing, i still don't see the ""soul"" coming out from Hahn as i do in Bell. I was also rather dissapointed by the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, of which its size did not provide the robustness and brute force required for such a pieace like the Barber."
3,"Good, but not quite Josh Bell","Although this recording of the Barber and Meyer violin concertos has its moments, Hilary Hahn has not quite reached the emotional maturity I hear in Josh Bells playing. However, I think as she gets older, Hahn will accomplish this. The third movement of the Barber is breath taking. I love it. This movement is meant to be played with the clarity and speed that Hahn plays it."
3,Frustrating,"This game guide, is good in that it explores every aspect of the game, all the bases are covered. Just what you'd expect from a good RPG strategy guide. However, I found the walkthrough section to often be incomplete. It just neglects to tell you important things! A few times it is even down right wrong. Once I saw the order that events are supposed to be performed reversed in the strategy guide! I think that a little more time needed to be put into proofreading this guide.I have to give it 3 stars simply because it would be hard to play the game without a guide and there aren't exactly an abundance of guides for any given game out there and the game is certainly worth playing. You might be able to find a decent strategy guide on the internet, but a the official guide, no matter how shoddy, is nearly always better."
5,!! Heavenly Voice !!,"This CD has been my constant source of enlightenment for the last week. There are so many amazing aspects to her voice, and the ""pure"" title is very appropriate. The quality of sound is very pure, youthful and innocent in her voice.This singer has full and detailed control over THREE OCTAVES and more, including all the saregam and decorative extended vocal techniques. It is not just showing off, either. The feeling of the music is always present.Anyone who likes Indian raga MUST listen to this girl, who is the next in line of classical indian singers!Malik"
2,It's...fine.,"This product is pretty inconvenient. Getting the little straps hooked to your bra is extremely annoying and even when they're hooked it's not that great and FORGET a quick trip to use the bathroom. (I don't use the little ""gusset"" at the crotch. It would requiring going sans panties and I'd be afraid of accidentally getting pee on it.) And if you choose not to use the complicated annoying little hooks, the back is constantly rolling down creating squeezed back fat that probably looks less flattering than not wearing the bodysuit at all. On the positive side, the material is very sleek and smooth under clothes, and smooths the tummy and thighs pretty well. But once again, the benefits are almost canceled out by the fact that the back rolls down all the time. For almost $[...], I don't understand why they cant create a more convenient way to keep the bodysuit up in the back."
1,Rolls up all the time!,"I was very excited when I received my spanx, especially with all the hype from celebrities. Boy was i disappointed! First of all, it's tremendously difficult to hook all four straps to your bra. I tried wearing it without the straps, since they were so difficult to put on, and it kept rolling up!!! Don't get this product!!!!!!"
1,the worst,"what a wste of money, i bought this to wear under a dress for a wedding and was so excited when i got it. the second i put the dress over it, i saw that it actually made me look fatter. it seemed like it just pushed everything together and not in a good way. my dress actually looked better without it. go figure. dont waste ur money and buy this."
2,Not too special,"This item was just so-so compared to other slimming undergarments. Even with the ""loops"" it came with to keep it attached to the bra it was still not a good fit, kept sliding down and had to take several trips to the ladies room to pull the legs and crotch up.for the money I don't think it does the job it promised.Anyway, I'm glad I tried this brand."
1,Not worth the $$$ pricetag,"Seriously disappointing. The straps keep the waistband from rolling (all Spanx pantyhose roll on me). But this does NOT suck it all in - the hose do that much better. In fact, it felt like the Slim Cognito provided no support at all."
3,Incomplete,The package containing the Spanx my wife ordered arrived without the removable straps that were clearly described and pictured in the ad. Amazon did not respond to our query.
4,Works Great!,"Its amazing! I read some other neative reviews and I was skeptical at first. I, however, love the product. I feel 10lbs thinner! It is definately just for special occasions, its more comfortable than your average ""gertle"", but not so that you would want to wear it normally. The little straps that go over your bra are a pain to fasten so have someone help. Also, they actually put thought into having to pee and built in this opening, which is thoughtful but tricky-haha. Overall, I would recommend it to someone trying to smooth out. I am about a 8 and easily went down a size."
1,Disappointed,"I had been wanting SPANX for so long. Today, I finally got my order. What a disappointment! The waist is not meant for the average-height woman (I'm 5' 4'-1/2""). Because it is too long, it has a definite crease in the back and rolls down. The straps that attach the shaper to a bra don't keep the shaper up; they draw the bra down! I cannot recommend this product and wish I could rate this under 1 star."
2,a modern torture device,"I wish I could get my money back. I didn't even make it 3 hours wearing these things. From the minute I took it out of the package, it was nothing but a headache. It literally took me 1/2 an hour to get it hooked to my bra, some how manage to get the bra AND the spanx on, then I had to spend even more time untwisting the connectors, refastening them over and over because they kept coming loose, I had to wrap the front connector around my bra like 4 times because it's way too long.Once I did manage to get the thing on correctly, and shimmy into my clothes, I found that I could not breathe and the top of it sat right on my ribs wear my chest expands to breathe. I was actually in pain because of the way the band sat on my ribcage. Breathing was extremely difficult and I literally took it off in the car on the way to a party and tossed it out the window. I will never buy another spanx product again."
2,"ok...but certainly not much of a ""shapewear"" item","I put this on, then measured. Here you go...the TRUTH folks!my waist was only 1/2"" inch smaller (barely, more like between 1/4"" inch and 1/2"" inch).In my lower stomach, where so many of us have a little pooch from having a child or getting older...NO difference. At all.No difference in my hips.Lifted my butt a bit...but not so much that anyone besides me would notice at all.Not too much of an issue with rolling down, but it did roll down/sag some at the top even with the straps, and roll UP a bit at the legs as I moved around.All in all, not much of a shapewear product. And not worth the money spent. Like so many other things, with this SPANX, there wasn't any truth in advertising."
3,"Not for every""body""","I purchased this item to wear under a knit dress, and while it did smooth out my figure, I felt insecure about it rolling down from the top during the event, so I returned this and wore something else. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the straps to wear with your bra are probably not the best fix for this. I believe I would have been more comfortable with traditional body shapers that include a bra. I did however find that this garment is as easy to put on as most products of its kind."
4,Spax Body Suit,LOVE that it hooks on to whatever bra you want. A little awkward to put on but once it's there you are good to go. The slit in the crotch made me laugh out loud - I didn't expect it to be there - but helpful none the less.
1,in pain from spanx,"I ordered spanx underwear after seeing an infomercial on tv. I wore them for the first time Sat. night. I followed the online directions for the size I would need. My first thought was that these were too small. I pulled and tugged and stuffed myself in though. I must say my dress looked better. However, I could hardly breathe. I thought I'd get used to it. However, in the car on the way to the restaurant, I made my husband turn around and go home so I could get them off. Sitting, I think, pushed everything up into my ribcage. I actually got them off in the car and immediately felt the blood returning to circulation. I could literally feel it. Anyway, woke up the next day with a soreness under my ribcage. At first I didn't know why. I went to the doc on Monday for a checkup and mentioned the sore rib. He said I bruised that area and should use ice and nuprin. NEVER again. I wear control top pantyhose and have never had an experience as bad as this....."
3,Lasted only 14 months,"Two months after the warranty expired the large burner would not work by tripping the circuit breaker. Other than that, it performed as expected. Should have lasted much longer in an apartment used by one person."
1,"Not worth the money, not even at a discount.","The best that can be said about this portable burner is that it is heavy. That's nice.It takes a 'month of Sundays' for it to heat up, and then, it decides to reduce the heat for extremely long periods of time.Waring seemed to be a good company, but this one item is not good."
5,Better than I expected,I purchased this item to help me survive a kitchen renovation. It has worked like a champ! It heats up quickly and performs like a real stove burner.Note: The pan you use has to be flat! Coming from a gas stove I didn't know that and tried to use a pan that wasn't flat the first time I used the burner. Things don't heat up since it only touches in one spot. Transferring the contents to a corning glass pot worked great.
3,Waring Pro DB60 problem,Waring Pro DB60 portable double burner problem. One of the four legs on the burner was not level. There was not a way to adjusted the leg that was too short so I had to send it back to Amazon. Amazon quickly issued a credit for the defective item. (It was easy to return too.) Other than one leg being too short the item looked well made but I was never able to use it. So I'll have to rate it once Amazon gets it in stock. Amazon should get 5 stars because of the convenience for returns.
4,Great product with limits,"Seems to work great for our purpose.We use it for canning but with smaller pint bath canner.Doesn't work great, but a lot better than our ceramic top stove would.I do not advise using this with larger bath (Quart) canners....it takes way too long to heat and retain boil."
4,likely the best quality you'll find,"solid, quality knobs, looks good, and gives you the best heat rating for a 110 volt counter top model. Only drawback is that it takes a long time to heat up. That said, it does heat evenly and stays hot for a long time. Be careful of burning self once it's off. I think the one burner is an even better buy."
3,Its just OK.,"It served its purpose, temporary burner while we waited for our new stove to arrive. I looks nice and is well constructed. My issue with it was I found it to be under powered, taking too long to boil water and/or heat things up, such as cooking meat in a pan. Its no where near the heating ability of a real stove. Not bad for small simple applications to get you by, but not for real dinner cooking. The whole professional grade/high wattage advertisement didn't perform to our expectations. I would not buy again, and ours is collecting dust in the junk cabinet."
4,its okay!,i think if we use one side then the other one is useless. Also sometimes it takes lots of time to heat up. anyway this product arrived on time. The sellers have nothing to do with it. The makers should have put more room for the other pot.
4,Works great!,"We ordered this hot plate to use during our kitchen renovation. While it is not the same as having a full stove it does the job. We have been able to cook on it, boil water, saute. My one complaint is that when you turn it off the dial does not have a definite off position. I would prefer if it clicked into the off position. I worry that it could get inadvertently knocked and turned on. Otherwise it works fine and serves the intended purpose."
2,waringsb301300 watt portable single burner,don't like ... not strong enough .. took a lot of time to get hot. didn't like the plastic sides
5,mama's little helper!,The Waring double electric burner is wonderful. I was skeptical but needed something to cook with as we remodeled the kitchen.Glad I chose the double burner as I can create a meal with no problem. In fact one night with the help of the barbecue and my little Waring burners I made dinner for 13! Highly recommend this product. It will come in handy for parties and holidays as well.
2,it's a 50/50 rating 2.5 stars,"I've been using this product for over a year as my main stove top cooking device. After the first 8 months the large plate stopped heating to full capacity.The warranty was expired because it had been over two years since the date on the product was stamped, even though I had only had it for 8 months... so out of luck there. A worthless warranty in my mind.I also have had to bring water to boiling in my coffee pot then transfer it to the burner. If you don't do this it is much worse than waiting for a watched pot to boil... it is infuriating!But because all else out there looks not so hot either, I purchased another one. This time it only took 3 months for the large burner to not fully heat to capacity.Would I buy it again? I hope not. We should be in our new house soon with a real stove top"
2,Very disappointed-not recommended,"I have had this unit for about a year and am very disappointed with its performance. It takes FOREVER to boil water, in fact, I now heat the water to the boiling point in my microwave, then transfer the water to a pot on this burner. Considering the price I paid, this product is definitely not worth it. It's okay for simmering, but that's about it."
5,Friggin awesome,"This thing is friggin awesome.It heats up quick, but takes a while to cool down.I've been using this item for about 3 months now and I have had no problems.The knob is great, it is nice and sturdy, unlike most other hot-plates."
3,Good but has some problems,"This is the second identical unit I've owned. The first one worked fine for about 6-8 months, then the temperature knob stopped working and I could only use it for 100% hot (5 on the knob) or nothing at all. Then it stopped working altogether.The most recent one had a problem the second time I used it. I was cooking poached eggs and some water boiled over the pan. The burner shot sparks about 2 feet out the side and burned my wooden counter, smoked, and shot out another big spark before blowing out the electrical breaker. The company should look into these issues and fix them. The second one could have been really dangerous."
2,"It's great as a single burner, but useless as a double","I'm a chef who teaches cooking classes for kids and needed an electric burner. This one seemed ideal because of the strong reviews and the fact that it had two burners. After having used it several times, I returned for one big reason: THE SMALLER BURNER IS USELESS and a waste of money.I plan to buy a single burner version of this, because I found the large burner perfectly suitable for portable cooking, it can get very hot and can accomplish the cooking I need to do.Meanwhile, the smaller burner, even put at it's highest setting, won't even get water to simmer. Honestly, you're better off buying two single burners if you really need two. I will buy a burner from the Waring Pro brand because, as I've said, the main burner does exactly what it needs to do, but this ""double burner"" seems great in theory but is not worth spending the extra cash."
3,Not as good as I expected,The unit is nice and the sealed burners keep clean but I am a little disappointed in the time it takes to heat up large pots of water. Maybe I expect too much from a portable burner.
5,Reliable Reliable Reliable & Dependable,"I've have this model for almost 2 years now and I have been VERY HAPPY with it. I mostly use it to boil water for tea but i have also used it for cooking rice. Be aware that this particular model does have an ""electronic"" smell to it during the first month of use as the electrical components are very new and need to season/'break in' a bit. After that breaking in period the smell goes away. Also I want to point out that this unit heats up very quickly when you first turn it on. In order to avoid burning your food you should not place your pot/pan on the hot plate until the green light has come on. Other wise the unit will boost its heat to also get your pan up to it's minimum heat level. This feature may annoy some but it's great for boiling water FAST. I love this machine - Very Reliable, Very Dependable! That's why I give it: FIVE BOILING STARS!"
5,Very good,I bought two of these to add burners to my busy kitchen during Thanksgiving. This not only added space to my busy stove but gave others a place to warm and cook what the brought to the party.
4,Good for travelers,"Because of the nature of my work, I need to move from time to time (every 3-6 months). When I moved to rent a house with a gas stove in it, I wanted to save money by not paying for gas service. So I researched for a single burner that would not cost too much. Thank you for the reviews that guided me to consider this item. Now, I am glad I purchased this. For functionality, it is good enough that I am able to cook. The only down side to using this product is that it heats up so fast, that it burned my eggs the first time I used it. I got the hang of it, so I never really rely on the control knob to turn up or turn down the heat. Sometimes, I even have to get the pan off the burner just to cool it down a bit so the food that I am cooking won't get burned. Hmmmm... not too difficult to figure out. Like what another reviewer mentioned, it is difficult to control the heat. Regardless, I am happy with my purchase."
5,Excellent hot plate,"This is an excellent (!!!) professional hot plate/extra portable burner appliance. It heats up incredibly rapidly...has fantastic iron cooking surfaces and a beautiful look and because the first single unit I purchased was so great, I now own two....one double and one single. This is by far and away the BEST portable burner I have ever used and I am a gourmet cook! A simply fantastic product!"
5,Waring DB60 Portable Double Burner,"We have three kitchen areas in our new office building. When they built our kitchen areas, they purchased two refrigerators and three microwaves, but no stoves; therefore we had nothing else to warm up our lunch foods or cook on when a microwave was not necessary. We purchased the double burner, and we love it! It is the perfect alternative to microwaving. Occasionally, usually Thanksgiving and Christmas, we have a dinner for the entire office, and this product will really come in handy then!Waring DB60 Portable Double Burner"
3,Almost worth it.,"We searched many burners before purchasing this one. We used the larger burner and it got hot quickly and was easy to regulate. We had it less than one year before the knob became ""glitchy"" and we had to mess with it to get the unit to turn on. After some time, it quit working all together. It could have been a great burner unit if the knob hadn't gone out. We wanted it to be all that but have had better luck with a single coil burner for one-forth of the cost."
1,"It lasts as long as the cheap stuff, but costs a lot more.","I'm not going to go into along story.This product is good while it lasts- which is not long. The heat is either very hot, or not so hot. There is no in between.I Bought this on February 3, 2010. In the beginning of 2011 I started noticing that the light would not go on when I turned the knob to the on position - meaning no heat. Shortly after the heat would stop while cooking unless I applied downward pressure to the knob. Now it is October 29, 2011 and it won't turn on at all.I spent the extra money on this, because I thought I was getting quality. Instead I got a burner which lasts as long as $15.00-$20.00 Proctor Silex or Premium burner.Save your cash and go with a cheap burner which will last you a year or two. I unfortunately, will have to take this to a dealer for repair since my warranty expired. It's a limited warranty which lasts for a year."
2,Don't Buy,"I would give it 5 stars for the price and the temperature level.The problem is that this burner is constructed from stainless steel and plastic (the black color sides in the picture) I bought two of those, and after two months, all the plastc sides melted. They are still working well, but they look uglly."
4,Hot Plate,"Even though i've only owned my burner for a month, i am very pleased so far. It takes about five minutes to heat up, but once heated it stays hot. I usually turn it up to about 4 or 5 depending on what i'm cooking and turn it down as needed. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,I feel like a pro already !!!,Not saying this will make you the next TV star chef...but you will benefit from this sturdy even heating burner. It's a bit pricey but worth it.
5,"Solid, Well Built Product",Works well and was very happy with it. Well made and heavy duty with a solid built look and quality name.
4,"So far, so good.","I purchased this hotplate for what most would consider to be a fairly odd set of uses:The first is warming up iron and aluminum bullet casting molds to the operating temperature of 350F in order to save time when casting. The second is for melting mixtures of beeswax, greases and other additives into lubricants for cast lead bullets.From a cold start, turning to the maximum ""5"" setting, this burner will boil a quart of water in about five minutes (at about 900 ft altitude) without the ""at temperature"" light even coming on. After this test, I slowly dialed the temperature down, and the ""at temperature"" light kicked on when I reached the ""3"" setting, which suggests to me that you can boil at least a quart of H20 at the lower settings.The burner does have a very beefy 8"" plate that heats evenly. For my one application thus far, it has served my lube-making needs well (low, even heat). I'd recommend it if you're needing a sturdy, functional, and large electric burner."
3,Basic Utilitarian unit,"Bought this during a kitchen remodel for temporary ""camping"" during construction. Burners warm up way too slow but it was an easy unit to use, light weight, simple, inexpensive compared to others."
5,"Great ""2nd stovetop""","I bought this unit as a backup stovetop while the kitchen was being renovated. It's nice and heavy, stable on the countertop. Easy to use, heats well, cooks great! It's not a $4500 Viking range, but it's a great substitute while one is being installed!"
5,Waring Potable Double Burner,I is professional quality which I like even though I'm using at home. I have'nt use it yet but I'm sure that it will work out fine.
2,heats very slowly...,"I have no experience with other portable stoves, but I found that this one heats very slowly. Bringing a pot to boil for pasta can take up to 40 minutes. It is fine for frying eggs, making a grilled cheese or burger, but using both burners at the same time is really pushing it's capacity. Great for keeping things warm but other than that, I was not too happy."
4,Well made but not as powerful as a stove...,"This hotplate is extremely well made and has the controls one wants - both an ""on"" indicator and a green indicator when the selected temperature has been reached. My only disappointment is that it doesn't get as hot as I hoped. A large pot of water takes a long time to boil, and even then it simmers. This feature improved after the first few times of use, but still seemed underpowered. I'll have to admit I was cooking maple sap down to syrup, which takes all day anyways, and it was successful in the end."
3,Expecting too much?,I don't know if I'm asking too much but it seems to take a long time to heat up food...even to boil water seems to take 3X the amount of time. If you are in a pinch it is ok but I wouldn't recommend this product.
3,It's a nice product just not for boiling,"I bought this burner for using at a cabin that will not be having a regular stove. For cooking most things it has served us well. It would not heat up a pot of water to boiling, after waiting about forty minutes we finally used the gas grill burner. The amount of water trying to boil was about 1 1/2 to 2 gallons so that was too much for it, a smaller amount would probably be fine. Overall I am happy and the smaller burner does a fine job of keeping things warm. The size is very good for my counter stores easily."
4,Good Buy,"I don't like electric stoves in general, because the response time is so incredibly slow compared to gas. Given that up front, the only thing that I can complain about is that it doesn't hold a temperature but has an on/off cycle that it goes through. However it gets plenty hot, in time, and I'm able to cook on it. It is easy to clean."
5,Great unit!,"We purchased this unit to tide us over during a kitchen remodel. It arrived promptly and was immediately put to use.We have been using this for the past week on a daily basis for all meals. On the positive side, it heats up extremely quickly and does a phenomenal job as a cooking plate. We have already made a wide variety of meal on it, using thick bottomed pots and pans.The only negative so far has been that the unit is so powerful, that we left the first dish in a small thick bottomed frying pans unattended on setting 2 of 5 for less than 2 minutes and burnt it. I strongly recommend that you try out the different levels first and pay attention until you get a feel for just how strong this unit is. We have not had to do any cooking on 4 or 5 yet!"
4,Waring Pro SB30 Burner,"Good solid and nicely designed burner with plenty of power. Only concern is that when a pot bigger than the burner is used the black plastic sides melt from the resulting heat. This happened to us when we used a 14"" grill to roast red bell pepper pieces for about 30 minutes. Functionality of the burner was not affected but it looks a little less attractive now with the melted plastic side pieces. Still better than any other burner I've seen offered in stores or on the Net."
2,"Great, until the plastic sides melted","Similar to another reviewer here, the plastic sides of my burner melted and now I have a functional but ugly product.I boiled a big pot of potatoes on this burner (which took a while but did its job just fine) and the pot had some overhang beyond the cast iron plate. Well, the heat from the pot melted a circular pattern into the plastic.Make sure you keep the heat low if you're going to cook with a pot or pan larger than the diameter of the cast iron plate."
5,Lifesaver,"I had a function at my church in which I had to warm a large pot of Gumbo which had been refrigerated the night before so I didn't know how long it would take to warm the pot up. Well it didn't take long at all and a lot of people were impressed with the Warning Pro DB60. Even the younger people had never heard of a hot plate in which the older folks use to call it, but overall it did the job and I was concerned it would not make it to my house in time because I didn't do the next day delivery but it arrived on time and I was very happy with that and the product.Thanks, AmazonSincerly, J. Joseph"
5,Great deal.,"I bought this for a friend that recently had a stove that quit working. She needed some thing temporary that could be used as a subsitute but just as good as a stove. This portable double burner was perfect for what my friend needed. Not only does it look really nice but it cooks just as good as a regular stove. I highly recommend this to anyone shopping for a portable burner, it's worth it."
1,Barely Functions,"This double burner has 5 settings, only 4 1/2 of them DON'T WORK. 5 (the highest setting) takes forever to heat up and barely boils. To simmer, I move the knob 1/4 inch from 5 towards 4. What are settings 1-4 for? I have no idea. Returning immediately."
3,Not all it was reviewed to be...,"Based on the reviews of others, my husband and I purchased this to be an extra burner for canning and using our pressure cooker on. It is seriously under powered. It takes three times as long to bring water to a boil on it as it does on the stove. Definitely not worth the money."
3,seems okay but be aware: it is HUGE,"If you don't have a lot of counter space for using this item, consider getting a single burner instead. I didn't realize how huge it is, much larger than a camp-style double burner. Still, seems to be made well and work fine"
1,Very Poor Heating,Purchased this hot plate to take the place of a range during a kitchen remodel. If I had any other alternative this product would have gone right back. The small plate doesn't heat past a low simmer while the large plate takes approx. 30 minutes to bring a small sauce pan to a boil. I do not recommend this product.
5,Portable single burner,"I needed this for a school lab that required a bigger heating surface and higher temperatures than our standard lab hot-plates could manage. We also needed fairly precise temperature control and relatively fast time to reach operating temp. It's worked extremely well, operating for up to 12 hours straight and holding the desired temp without tinkering with the control knob. Once we got the heat control dialed in, we added a dot to the face of it. Now, we just turn it to that position; the unit reaches the desired temp quickly and holds it all day.Great value for the price."
4,inexpensive hot plate for classroom use,"I purchased this hotplate as an alternative to a 300 dollar science lab hot plate. I like it alot. The only draw back is that the top has a rim so its not completely flat. It fits 1 large beaker or flask (1000 ml), or 2-3 smaller ones. It heats as fast as a lab hot plate, about 10 minutes for 300ml water in a 600ml beaker to boil. It has adjustable heat level that works. I teach Biotech and Anatomy/Physiology so I only need the hot plate to boil water or warm gels. I've used it about 5 times so far, so I have no long term knowledge to share, but, I like it so far. Beats the heck out of spending 300 bucks for 1 hot plate, I could get 6 of these for that price."
2,not flexible cables,"The cable coating is not flexible if the temp is even close to freezing. The boosting capability of the inner wire and the clamps is good. But when its only +20 degrees outside and you pick up the cables five feet from the end of them and they just stick out horizontally like there is a 2x4 attached to them, that makes the cable pretty worthless. If it was 30 below zero out, I think they would just snap in half. The outer coating on the cables is junk."
4,Unusual but very good,"This is a great licorice treat for big licorice fans. The drops are soft and much saltier than I was expecting but nevertheless, I could not stop eating them by the handful. Not for the feint of heart or non-licorice fans."
5,very good,"Ships as an oblong box with 6 plastic canisters inside. Reasonably easy to open and tight sealing. There is a good number of small pieces, shaped like gumdrops but much firmer in texture. Let them melt in your mouth or release a it's flavor with your first bite. Not too gooey, and not overly intense flavor--just good solid taste.Made with real licorice root so consider possible effect if you have high blood pressure. [...]"
4,Excellent Licorice Taste,If you are a fan of licorice then this candy is for you but only for those of you that really love this taste. If you are only a moderate fan of licorice then you may want to pass on this.Because this is an intense licorice ride. It's a great chew and a punch of flavor.
2,Not so good,"I love licorice and have had the ""real"" stuff before. These drops are chewy and have this ammonia taste which I find most unpleasant. They also get stuck in the teeth and leave a nasty aftertaste.I suggest Young and Smylie drops from Hershey's. They are a great texture and taste. Won't stick to the teeth either! They are just a shade more expensive but well worth it."
3,Mediocre product,I have been buying licorce for more than 3 decades. This brand is very much lackluster.
4,"I'm no expert, but this works for me",I don't know much about the technical quality of this performance or recording. I can say that I've been listing to the Preludes since I was a child in probably a half-dozen different recordings. This performance and recording evoke in me the best sensations I experienced listening to this music as a boy.
3,An unfortunate recording,"Technically speaking, Weissenberg does a good job. But the way he plays Rachmaninoff's preludes is rather embarassing. Look at the music, for instance, and you'll see plenty of instances where Weissenberg ignores what Rachmaninoff wrote. This simply isn't fair."
1,Flush it!,"An eye-plucking deranged psycho stalks, taunts and mutilates bank robbers and their hostages in the bowels of the city. Just terrible. It may be billed as a Ghost House Underground flick, which is exactly where it belongs...UNDERGROUND. Save your time and money."
1,skip it and move on . . .,"I honestly couldn't get through this movie. I had a chance to sneek peek it - and quite honestly - it just sucked. Wasting 45 minutes was enough to just skip the ending and move on. Now understand that if there is only 2 or 3 great scenes in a movie - I will keep it for the sake of my collection. But this s**t was just boring. I even opted for the original language version - russian, I believe - but it still failed. The acting wasn't so bad I guess, but the story was pretty much non existent. I would say that any of these movies, be it ghost house underground, afterdark horrorfest, masters of horror - are all $5 movies and spending anything more is foolish even if you enjoy em. My advice it to rent - although I haven't rented in about 10 years!"
4,Will there be a second book?,I loved this book and am now worried that the author is not going to meet his goal in order to write the second book. Talion: Nemesis. I want to continue in the adventures of Nolan and Jevin. I have my fingers crossed the the author will realize there is now enough readers engaged in this story.
5,Can't wait for Nemesis,Bought on the great reviews. Well worth it. Stackpole had me turning pages like mad. I'm Looking forward to Nemesis.
4,3 Stars Until It Becomes 4 Stars,"Can I say 3 stars for most of the story and then 4 when it really picks up, at the end?I think this book could have been a lot more satisfying had it been trimmed down a little more, been tighter and faster. If I could tear out all the pages of lesser [or un-]importance, Talion: Revenant could have been a 5 star short story! The way it is, though, I can only give it 3.5 stars, rounded up because the ending deserves at least that.Not that the pages I'd tear out were bad, mind you. They were just too far from the plot and lessened its impact significantly."
5,A Great Book,Talion is without doubt one of the best books I've read. The main character feels very real as he struggles both to complete his assignment and to revenge himself on his enemies. The moral dilemma pose by the author in this is very compelling.I'm generally not a fan of books that weave back and forth through time but the author really does a good job of relating the events in the past to what the hero is doing right now.I woud highly recommend this book there is no question that is will be well worth the read.
5,"Impressive, MOST Impressive","I originally grabbed this book because I enjoyed Mike's X-Wing books. However, the moment I began reading I liked it more than Star Wars. The story is similar to Star Wars and caused me to neglect homework to read on and on into the night."
5,Great Book,"Original fantasy is so hard to come by, and this is one book that truly fits that description. Well-written, although not as polished as Stackpole's later books. If you're looking to immerse yourself in an interesting and entertaining fantasy world, than this is the book for you."
5,Excellent book,"This is an amazing book. It is a well thought out story. I can't wait for the sequel. Stackpole delivers, again!"
4,"great book, but a little depressing","this was the first fantasy novel I ever read. I loved it, right down to the the last chapters. Then it became a little depressingStill, it is one of my favorite books. I recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy or doesnt"
3,Good pick for a young reader of fantasy,"Very simplistic themes and writing style. I gave it to my 12 yr. old cousin b/c I thought it would be appropriate for someone who didn't yet have very discerning taste in fantasy. Ironically, he asked me to explain the very passages that I myself found poorly thought out. The training segments were the most entertaining for me, but any of the more advanced concepts were perhaps intentionally left very vague. Concepts such as the nature of the soul on this world and where the skull came from that decided what was just and unjust were just glossed over. Again, this didn't ruin the book, just made it very simplistic. Before I buy another of his books, I will read it in the store to assure myself that he matured in his later works."
5,Great WORK,"Network+ exam coupon and Network+ practice was an excellent work. Practice test has description and mapping to exam objective hints, web links for futher indepth study. I really like that learning style. Thanks for HUGE saiving on Network+ exam and registration with Pearson VUE using net+ exam coupon was snap."
2,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed when I received this book. At $9.99 I expected more. The questions presented in the book are things I already talk about with with my children, I was really hoping for some new insights. I don't think this book is worth more than $3.00."
1,Battery was dead on arrival,When I received this battery it was dead. Had no charge. It was also cut out of a larger package of batteries and the packaging looked worn and rumpled.
3,"Purchase was quick and easy, How do you rate a battery??",Nothing wrong with first purchase but on reordering the same item the seller changed the price and quibled. No more for me
4,Great for Newbies and Professionals,It is really a marvelous creation. Pile has put together the most basics of interior design and put it into a exciting format for an introduction to interior design survey course. All the in the pictures in the book are beautifully put together and the book contains continuous harmony with each page you turn.
3,need more pictures and diagrams,Need more pictures and diagrams to explain the point rather than using a lot of words.It is tough to cover the book within limited time.
2,not good for limes,"This press may work well on larger citrus like lemons, but it doesn't do a good job on extracting all of the juice from limes. I purchased the Oxo citrus press in a pinch when I couldn't find my Norpro press. I've used that juicer on both lemons and limes with equally good results. I still can't find my Norpro and am going to spend the money to replace it."
2,Metal quality scares me,"We have been using this for lemons and limes for about a year and while it does a great job and is very sturdy, I am concerned about the fact that the exterior coating has been worn away from the juice and the cast aluminum (I am guessing here) is exposed. I think we are probably ingesting aluminum oxide and that concerns me. It would be nice to find one of these in a sturdy stainless steel that is not a cheap Chinese knock-off."
4,First Autograph Work in Western Musical Tradition Rings True,"In a sense, Frederick Renz and the artist members of New York's Ensemble for Early Music have made one of the most significant recordings ever. They have recorded the music by the earilest known autograph composer, Ademar of Chabannes, the 11th-century composer (whose signed manuscript manuscript constitutes the first autograph composer in the Western tradition).Composer Ademar is, as noted Boston University Professor Richard Landes has observed, a talented liar. The music composed by the troubled monk from Limoges, France, is heard here for the first time since the Middle Ages. It is a flawless performance as far as chant is concerned. For this reason alone, the recording is a must have. Better chant is to be found, but not from such an early date."
5,great album,If you haven't heard a Esham album I suggest you pick up this one. It has some of his best tracks. The creator of tha wickit sh*twill always be tha underground king....Long live tha BoogeyMan!!!!
3,Warning: Cord Can't Be Used With Many Outdoor Timers,"I got this to use for my outdoor holiday light display. The male end of the plug (the end that connects to the wall outlet) has an oversized casing that prevents it from being plugged into many outdoor timers. (A protrusion on the timers blocks the oversized casing on the plug). Although the cord works fine if plugged directly into an outlet, be warned, this brand of cord won't work with many outdoor timers typically used for holiday light displays. There are other brands/models of cords with the same specs/features that will work with the timers."
3,Cannot recommend it unless one is a history of science buff,"This book presents a somewhat interesting tale of what happened up to the first split of an atom. Some of the chapters are quite entertaining, but too much emphasis seems to have been devoted to the actual characters and, to my taste, far too little to the science/technical part. I would have preferred a more balanced book in this sense....it is not very usual for me to stop reading a book I have started, but this one ended in that short list at about 70% of its length...I just simply lost interest...will look for something else since clearly I went into this book with the wrong expectations...this is clearly a book for people that love the inside stories on the history of science."
2,No Hot & Spicy - No great flavor as well,"The energy club peanuts are not spicy at all and above that they have an unpleasant taste, at least for me. If one wants to have spicy peanuts should try the ""Da Bomb""- Ghost pepper nuts-naga jolokia."
4,"Nice shoes, strong smell","Nice shoes, but my son complained when wearing them of their strong smell. Not for those with a sensitive nose. Otherwise, they worked fine."
3,Too Cool!,"The description of this item was changed after I purchased it. I thought it was the full lightsaber, not half! I decided to give it to someone else and just bought a different gift for my son instead."
1,pure garbage!,"brain damage productions is the worst horror film studio on earth. makes troma looklike anchor bay if they had their head up their arse's. i once owned a copy of this film and it did nothing for me so i took it back and swore this JUNK studio off. tiffany shepis is one of the worst horror films actress's there is, next to amy andrea ""former miss howard stern"" brookes hollness(yes,she married ned arnel hollness(aka carlos mencia), both are now hacks!!"
4,Now we're talking horror.,Death Factory is one of the best low budget horror flicks I've seen in a while. And I've seen a lot.
4,Measure of Vengeance,"Megan Roark, aspiring author and full time editor for a major New York Publishing house, starts receiving black envelopes with chapters of an unsigned work. At first she believes the chapters are fiction. Gradually she begins to believe that the author is actually telling his own story. Megan hears a news report of a body being found and realizes the name is same as one of the women in the chapters sent to her. Megan finds out who is on the case, a Lieutenant Colunga, and calls him with details but refuses to give her name for fear of becoming a victim.Go along on the journey to find this sadistic serial killer who is looking for love in all the wrong places. Jerry Jellison guides the reader into the soul of this sadist killer who wears a mask of sanity while going about his daily job in society. The first four chapters are slow to get started but after that the story really takes off fast."
5,Fortunate Pilgrim - A must for Italo-Americans and great for all,"Based on Mario Puzo's best book, this is a masterpiece. I have read the book twice and never thought the film would come close but it does. From the opening scene with the voice of Pavorotti singing over the street noise to the wonderful ending it is a great story of a wonderful Italian mother who is going to make it in America for her family. Sophia Loren is amazing. If you are of Italian heritage or just know an Italian; you must see this!"
5,The Fortunate Pilgrim,"Excellent movie. Originally seen on TV many, many years ago. Finally able to purchase a copy. The story of an Italian family's immigration to the U.S. and all of their sacrifices, sorrows and joys. Able to visualize my own family's immigration and early life in U.S."
1,bad copies,"i ordered and recieved twice, both had to be returned for choppy and pixalated in second episode and third episodewould not play at all. very disapointed."
2,Read the Novel,"Some interesting cinematography gives one a little sense of Hell's Kitchen, but the best thing to do is read the novel, Mario Puzo's The Fortunate Pilgrim, for its powerful family tale. Sophia Loren can't quite pull off the character of Lucia Santa."
3,The Fortunate Pilgrim DVD quality.,Was expecting higher quality video and audio from this DVD. Too much video appears to have been compressed onto one DVD. It should have been put on two DVD's. Had to crank up audio to hear it clearly.
4,His music continues on,"As always Andrew is with stellar musicians that are not afraid to step outside the mainstream. It's great to hear that these musicians from NYC have pursued the music of Mr. Hill and collaborated with him. The musicianship is exemplary, somewhat dramatic, the compositions challenging. I only wish that Andrew could have the chance to document more of his music. We all know that this will never happen in the United States."
3,Quick service,I recieved the product quickly but had to return it because I had ordered the wrong thing. No problems with return
5,Great display book,"Full of information I never knew about. Great pictures.Makes a great coffee-table book. This book and ""SS HITLER'S FOREIGN DIVISIONS: Foreign Volunteers in the Waffen SS 1940-1945"" by Christopher Bishop make great coffee-table books: both hardcover with the cover-image printed on both the jacket and book binding!"
1,A bad mistake,"When I was looking for new tableware, I was very excited when I found this design which was very decent compared to whats out there in the market! I got it for an excellent price as well. ALTHOUGH, I realised much later that this is 18/0- I thought it was 18/10 which basically means this item turns black very fast. And it does- I have had it for a month now and I already see black dots on it!!! I had thought Id gotten something beautiful for a very reasonable price that would last me for long- but I was wrong- Other than the fact that this item corrodes very quickly, it is a beautiful set- although I will have to replace very soon...."
2,You get what you pay for,"I have always loved the quality of Oneida products, but this one although I know is good quality they are too light, thin, feel very inexpensive, I have bought for my daughters others sets that were much heavier and were much better quality, Oneida of course. well you get what you pay for, this one will do good for kids parties if you do not want to bring out the good stuffware."
4,Good economical choice for everyday,"This set is quite nice for daily use. I have had Oneida flatware before that was of a higher quality but cost more also. The knives seem to show the lower quality level the most, while the spoons and forks have held up much better. This is a very nice set for the price though. Really! I am very pleased that we made this purchase. It is much better than similarly priced sets. I believe it was a real bargain!"
5,Great Flatware,"We needed new flatware (flatware that all matched was the goal) and this pattern appealed to us.It is well made, comfortable in the hand, and durable. It's been through the dishwasher a million times, and still looks very nice. And they all match. : )"
2,Cheaply made,Cheaply made and fragile. Burnt out in a few weeks? Amazon did send a quick replacement. There is a metal washer on the top that seems to make it vulnerable to water damage.
1,It failed!,"I installed this solenoid on my motor and began the season in May, 2011. It worked fine until today, only four months later. It just quit, and there seems to be an internal break in the actuating solenoid wiring. I'm very disappointed."
5,A LifeLift,"I have always been a fan of Lisa Whelchel's since I grew up watching The Facts of Life. I am a homeschooling mother of seven and looked forward to the release of her latest book.I think that many of us moms forget that we need to regenerate ourselves so that we can continue to be effective in every aspect of our lives. Lisa's frank honesty of her own life gives the reader the realization that she has struggled in many ways like the rest of us. She gives encouraging chapters on refueling and then concludes each with practical ways to implement the thought into our lives. I feel that as I have added each aspect to my life, I don't ""droop"" in spirit nearly as often. Thank you Lisa, for a wonderful book!"
5,"Unique approach to architecture. Concise, accessible to all.","Of the many books I've read on architecture, this has been by far the most influential; it inspired by bachelor of architecture thesis. Heschong argues that thermal aesthetics in architecture, although almost universally overlooked, affect building users at least as much as visual aesthetics. She supports her thesis by naming dozens of examples linking thermal qualities to psychology/perception, culture, traditions, language, and, of course, architecture. The book is accessible to everyone and not just architects: it is not at all technical and is very concise. Yet it is thorough, and is sure to change the reader's perception of his or her thermal environments."
3,Stylish and well-made,"I think this is a perfectly fine rice cooker, perhaps a bit over-priced, but it IS one of the famous ""Made in Japan"" rice cookers for which Zojirushi is justly famous.It differs in one main respect from the excellent ZUTTO NP-DA10 model sold in Japan: that one (which has served me brilliantly for 2 years now) uses the Induction Heating cooking method, which this North American version does not have. I think IH would have justified the price of this; without it, well...Perfectly fine rice, good design and functionality. And I don't agree with the comments about ZUTTO ""bombing out"" in Japan or cheap or flimsy plastic. The reviews on Amazon.jp (which you can check) are universally positive. See one in person at your local shop before you decide."
2,Rice Cooker,This is my third Zojirushi Rice cooker and my least favorite.I didn't like this model because cleaning the inside lid and moisture cup collector is needed after each use. The top does not close if the inside lid is not in place. Sometimes I have to try a couple of times to open the lid. Seems to get stuck. There's also no place to put the rice spoon.
3,Intense emotional film!,"First of all, I think labeling this movie as an action/thriller is a definite misnomer. It is more of a drama. However, I think it's pointless to think too hard trying to categorize films only to strictly expect things typical of a film belonging to that genre. I mean come on, this is Bollywood. Blackmail has it all--action, drama, romance, the works. I thought there were some good action sequences, particularly the carnival scene. Priyanka Chopra and Diya Mirza don't have much of a role and are simply there to add a couple of songs. The essence of this movie is the father-son relationship. Suniel Shetty's adopted son means everything in the world to him after losing his real son. Ajay Devgan's search for his son leads him to a shocking yet heartwarming realization. The father-son relationship has been portrayed absolutely beautifully in this film. The climax is a real tearjerker. All actors and actresses have given extraordinary performances."
2,"the wallet was not like at picture, i'm not satisfied","the wallet i recieved was not like displayed at picture, i did not like the wallet, the wallte is too simple!! i really dont like it!"
1,Very disappointed,"I generally like Sheldon's ""beach"" reads. Usually great fun which decent premises. I'm not hard to please. However, this offering was dismal.Storylines were picked up and dropped without resolution. Most of the characters were grossly underdeveloped or mere stereotypes. You know going into a Sheldon book that it's not going to be an English Lit assignment, but this one was weak in comparison with his other selections."
2,"Flat, but fast","This book was something that I read in one day, just to pass the time. I really didn't care about the characters, and Lara seemed just too unreal to be true. She was too much of Scarlet O'Hara in her dealings with a real estate world dominated by men. I only finished it to find out what crisis happened that gave her an empty birthday party, but when I finally came to the end, it wasn't too satisfying."
2,readable novel,This is a beach book if you don't have anything to read. I am not going to read another Sheldon's book based on this one. The plot is there but the whole novel read like a condensed version. The sentences are basic and bare. The events happened so fast you never feel involved. Try Nelson DeMille's or John Sandford's.
5,Loved it,"I'm a big fan of Sidney Sheldon. Curious as to where the books come from since he has died but nonetheless, keep them coming. Always a good read."
3,Entertaining but thin,"I'm a died in the wool Sheldon fan. I've read all his books, a few more than once. I like his pacing, a master of the page-turner. And TSSD is no exception. What I missed in this book is narrative drive and some description. It's 90% dialog which after a while sets me off to skipping to get to the end. Like all his books, this one is filled with twists and turns and a rocket ride to the end. So, I'll keep on reading all his books, even if I'm disappointed once in a while."
4,Sheldon scores again.,"Good book. Kept me interested and though I could imagine what was coming. Sure enough, the woman . . ."
4,Great book,"Amazing book , one of my favourites .. just when u think it might get a bit boring or monotonous sheldon creates another twist!Perfect blend of crime , mystery ,suspense, romance , thriller and success story. Could not put the book down! only downfall... the end comes very suddenly."
4,A GOOD READ,"I enjoyed reading this book. I was impressed by the style of writing. Sheldon painted a clear picture of how women can still be sexy, sassy and business orientated. This is a page turner."
3,Stars shine down sparkling...,"Stars shine down...its like shimmering sparkling down with the twinkling shine...Sure Sid's book are all great but this one I felt has a theme of a beautiful Lara Cameron who is a self made billionaire whose character in the book revolves round fortune n fame. Interesting to read as Lara struggles to reign into male domain and portrays a ruthless character feeling insecure at times. She has busy appointments for the day and strive to achieve for more as she travels from London to New York and Reno to Rome and when her fortune dwindles, its the pages you never stop to read. At times the theme seems fine but bit too heavy with stepping in of Alder who offers Lara an exciting new dimensions at a price to pay that threatens to destroy them both. A nice book to read to kill time when you have lots to spare."
5,BUY IT!,"This is the most wonderful and original CD I have bought in years. The lyrics are the best poetry I have heard in ages. The moods vary from ballads to the rollicking ride of the Eliza Jane. I was so sorry to hear Dave Carter died. I never heard of him a month ago, but now I feel like I have lost a friend."
4,CLASSIC.,"One of the true tragedies of the folk music world was the loss of Dave Carter. The title song is a classic and worth the price of the CD. The other songs are good, if a bit primitive compared to later works. A good listen."
3,"The letters are great, the rest is chaos","I was really excited to read this book after hearing someone talk about it. I looked forward to an insight on Bill's struggle with depression and also hearing the guidance he received from Father Dowling. In that way, the book did not disappoint. The letters are great. My complaint is the way this book is written. I am an avid reader, yet this book makes very little sense! I do not understand the authors point, his interpretations, why he even grouped sections of letters together. He doesn't seem to have a theme, that I can see. I still think this book is worth having in your collection, just for the letters."
2,Similar story I read durings the 1980s....,"Interesting read, but as I read the book, I realized it was the same story, that was published as a paperback (Maybe Harlequin?) romance novel that I read back in 1981 or 1982. Main thing I remembered was that the cover had an elaborate illustration of a redhead dressed as an haremgirl being seduced by an sultan. Back then it was titled something like ""The Bas_Khan?"" but the story line focused more on the relationship of the Sultan's parents mainly his mother (who was an Irish girl that was kidnapped), and later her struggle to get free of that world and thwart the Russian vixen's power grabbing plans."
2,Missed a lot,"Shame on you for writing half a book. What would you say about an author who did not find out where his main character was from???Even after it was well know in Eastern Europe complete with ten part mini-series.Hureem Sultan aka Roxolana aka Russlana was from Rohatyn in Western Ukraine. Her father was an orthodox priest and she was taken prisoner while at her wedding and sold into slavery. Now does that help the story?Hurem kept in touch with her mother, sent money back to build a church and kept the Sultan from conquering her beloved Ukriane. Tatar my butt. In 1990 the archives were still under communist rule but this is 2005. Was the author that lazy to rewrite the book? It would have made much more sense.Too bad"
1,soap opera,i dont understand how anyone could have given this book 5 stars. there is hardly any character developement just twists and turns and a plot that makes as much sense as the unjustifiable plot twists in day time soaps. Why does hurrem hate the sultan so much? what motivates her? the intrigue was distracting and didnt make much sense. it was a waste of valuable time. spoiler ahead. the writer doesnt even bother to tell us how imbrahim could have possily slept with hurem. I like intrigue but i didnt want to read a mindless soap opera with one dimensional characters.
1,Ugh,"This is one of the few I've ever been too disgusted to finish. The beginning of the novel gave me the impression that Hurrem was fighting for her freedom; however, I was sorely proved wrong. The minute intrigues of Hurrem was something I suffered to get through. It was just boring! Falconer never explains why Hurrem hates Suleyman so much, nor does he have any redeeming characters. Now I understand that not all books have heroes, but this book makes you want to scream, ""Why are these people so dumb?!?!"""
4,A Master Playwright,"Every time I pick up this collection, I find myself sitting and reading for hours. Something about Stoppard's command of the language, his own personal calling card, is undeniably riveting.And though there are times (especially in Day & Night) where it seems that characters are too clever for their own good, his sense of timing and his love for delivering a smart, believable group of people amazes me.This collection is wonderful in its scope, including everything from the frequently produced ""Hapgood"" to the more recent treasure ""Indian Ink."" It's a must-have."
1,What were the Dirt Devil designers thinking?,"All vacuums have an air exhaust somewhere on them. Incredibly, the Dirt Devil designers placed their's right up front just below the headlight, so air blows hard on the floor directly in front of the vacuuum. Anything loose (e.g., dog hair, dust, paper, grass, etc.) is blown away BEFORE you can reach it with the vacuum. Vacuuming with the Dirt Devil becomes a game of chase. Good luck as you try to sneak up on the dirt before its blown away from the vacuum. (Don't even TRY to use this lemon on a tile floor!) No wonder I got this on sale for 60 bucks. Looks like it's time for the Dirt Devil company to go in the dustbin."
1,Worst vacuum ever,"Here is a good trick, try putting cleaning powder on your carpet and vacuum it up using this dirt devil vacuum. You create a massive dust storm that does exactly the opposite of what you want to do....clean. Afterwards you are left dusting all other furniture and coughing up the powder (which i can't imagine is that safe). The design of this product is flawed...put a blower on the front...nice job Einstein. Seriously they should offer a refund to all who purchased this product."
1,Don't waste your money,"We have a Bissel Healthy Home vac and I LOVE it. We have three dogs over 50lbs and two cats and LOTS of carpeting. People who are allergic to animals come to our home and never even get a sniffle. I wanted to get a second one for upstairs, but my husband got a ""good deal"" on this dirt devil. I was upset, but a it's a vacuum, so I used it. The belt broke the SECOND time I used it. When it does work, it doesn't even compare to the Bissel. I heard dirt devil was cheaply made and doesn't last long, and this just backed those claims up. Now we use it in the garage to catch spiders (we've only had it three months) and bought the second Bissel for upstairs. Don't waste your money folks..."
2,not very powerful,"Sure it is great that the handle folds down and that the vacuum is light. However it is not very powerful. I used it at a store I work at. The wind had blown in a few fall leaves. This vacuum just kind of crunched the leaves and spit them out. Eventually, I was able to vacuum them all up but it took a long time. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Dirt Devil is an apt name for this vacuum.,"This is truly a DEVIL when it comes to cleaning. The exhaust blows everything up and away BEFORE you can vacuum it. Great design, Dirt Devil!!! But, the worst part is... I used it 2 times and it kept on stopping. Then I started it again, and it stopped again. Called Dirt Devil, they told me to take it to a service center. I did!!! The service center said it was the Hepa Filter and it needed to be replaced. $$$$$$ After only using it 2 times only in my living room??? Give me a break. I'll take a bagged vacuum anytime, No dust.. no dirt. This is a piece of junk! I HATE IT!!!"
4,Works Good,"I needed a vacuum for the apartment. Bought this at Bestbuy 2 months ago for about $60. It is small and lightweight. It does get the job done, I am always surprised to see how much dirt is in the container after using it. I vacuum once a week and the place is deffinately cleaner. I recommend it."
4,Great product,"Works fine so far! I was looking for a pretty cheap, light vacuum for my little two bedroom apartment. It definitely does what I need it to do; however, for anything larger than a two bedroom apartment this may not be such a great pick. When I empty out the trap for this vacuum it is quite full; the capacity or volume that this vacuum can handle does not appear to be quite large.Definitely not for houses."
1,This vacuum blows,"This vacuum blows. No,quite literally, it blows! Picture the following scenario. You are approaching an unspecting dust bunny on the floor. Just when you are about to go in for the kill, it is blown to bits and scattered all over the room. Not a pretty sight. If you like chasing dust and dirt all over the room, this is the vacuum for you.I can't believe it ever made it out of the early design phase. The exhaust is directed right to the floor in front of the vacuum thereby blowing away just what you are trying to vacuum. When you want it to suck, it blows."
4,I LOVE this vacuum,"This vacuum is to replace my shark. It is fantastic. I have asthma and it does a great job. I will complain however, (purchased at target store) it did not come with screws or instruction book to put together. Dirt devil wants you to go online but their online link did not open, thankfully I have half a brain and put it together myself and wonderfully so !!! glad i did not return it for lack of screws or directions it is wonderful. I gave it 4 stars because they did not supply the screws and manual. further, it is hard to know which belt to order because no manual came inside and if you look at dirt devils website it gives you a choice of two ......lame company ... great vacuum"
4,Decent power and compact size,"Purchased the Dirt Devil to use at my cabin. It has surprising suction power for a compact machine. Fairly easy to empty the ""dust cup"". OK machine at budget price."
1,Poor on bare floors and ate my carpeting,"I agree with the previous review about the idiocy of putting the blower where they did. You can't vaccum up anything on a tile floor, as it scatters before the vaccum can reach it. Moreover, we just spent about 10 grand on new carpet, and this vaccum literally ate my carpet. Not just stray fibers, or what new carpet typically sheds. We're talking the entire canister filled with carpet. I want my money back on this cheap thing."
5,The right book for any Data Network Design Engineer,"I bought this book according to the recommendations and comments of some readers.After reading the book ,I would say that this book is essential for any engineer want to learn the right way to suggest excellent design for any types of Date network (LAN,MAN,WAN).This book also useful for engineers who worked as a technical engineers and want to be design engineers."
1,Boring Game,"I bought this game a couple of months ago and only played it once. It his horrible. One of the worst games I ever played. Basically you just sit there and fish with no real objective. They weren't kidding when they called this game reel fishing, its just like real fishing, reel boring. Try Action Bass its cheaper and you can have fun playing it unlike this game."
4,a nice gift for 13 y.o. son,Good selection of fishing lures and baits and fish you can catch. Son notes game is difficult. Graphics for the time game was created were ok.
3,Not the best and not the worst...,"This book was just OK. I like the author's scene descriptions and character development. If I had to do over again, I'd probably pass on this book for one more entertaining. Sorry, but this book just didn't do it for me. On the other hand, it wasn't a complete waste of time either."
4,In the Middle of Nowhere.....,"The Group of 'Remnants' is lost,that's all there is to it,they are lost.they are stuck in a ship that calls it self 'mother',they are in a computer generated enviroment,in the middle of a cooper-colered sea in a ship 500-hundred years from an earth thats doesn't exist any mor.face it,they are in Nowhere land.........."
1,Not Recommended At All,"I didn't think you could really go wrong with any type of trail mix, but the ""Fancy"" Mojo Mix proved me wrong. At first, the taste just seemed off to me. Finally, I just got bugged at how not good it was, so I decided, ""I just want the delicious chocolate candies since the rest of it is no good"". That's when I realized that the chocolate is the worst part! I ended up throwing away the vast majority of a 28 oz bag I had purchased for a road trip. Save yourself the disappointment and don't buy EnergyClub Fancy Mojo Mix."
