2,sequals are never as good,"following in the footsteps of oceans eleven, in one word... horrible. the plot was really weak, and the ending was completly unexpected, in this case, that was not good. there was nothing wrong with the actors, they were all good, it is just the plot was horrible."
2,Not Up To Ocean's Eleven.,"A couple nights ago I watched and then reviewed ""Ocean's Eleven."" It was a reasonably good movie and supplied fairly high entertainment value. As such, last night I viewed ""Ocean's Twelve, a part of the three-film packet which I had bought"" The cast and production values of this sequel were high. No question. It was interesting to see the various parts of Europe included in the script. The story was a total failure, however. It was overly long long and confusing. Boring is a good word that comes to mind. What were they thinking? The follow-up to ""Oceans 11"" was a dud! It just didn't match up. There's no use in wasting any more electrons on this subject. If you're interested in the Oceans series of films, The ""Oceans 12"" is a dud. Save your money.Gary Peterson"
3,Fun buddy movie,"This is a great buddy movie and the chemistry between Brad Pitt and George Clooney's characters is still there. A little choppy and harder to follow, but the fun is still there. Good surprise twists. Worth adding to your library."
1,Don't bother...,"I did not sit through the whole thing, could not stay AWAKE... a waste of 60+ minutes and I'll never get them back. What the hell is wrong with them?? They might as well have just put out a ""Aren't we cool, all famous buddies and stuff 2006 Calendar??!!"" and call it a day.And all the money that must have been flushed...I've heard there are a few people in the world who could have used it this year..."
2,11 is better than 12,"Disappointing and nowhere near as good as OCEANs ELEVEN. The majority of the cast was on-screen for mere minutes while Damon, Pitt, and Clooney (even Zeta-Jones) ran the show. The plot was so thick with ""twists"" and devices that the film quickly became hard to watch and quite boring. The film drags in more than a few places and many of the scenes seem out of place. That being said, this was an all star cast and there were a few memorable moments that salvages this movie from 2 stars. But by the time the big climatic reveal of how they did it rolls around, I was having trouble not falling asleep."
2,"The con is on, and the victim is...","...us. We were successfully liberated of $10.Ocean's Eleven carries the distinction of being one of few remakes to easily outshine the original. With tremendous chemistry, a good plot-line and excellent direction Eleven can be watched over and over.With this pedigree, I had high hopes for Twelve. Unfortunately, Twelve falls flat on all accounts. There is no longer a TEAM of con-men, just many individuals who can't even stay together for the whole movie. The story is feeble, and when all the answers are revealed you're left asking ""Huh?"" While some people found the Hollywood inside jokes entertaining, I felt they were unnecessary and distracting.Overall, a grave disappointment. If you feel the need to see this sequel for completeness-sake - wait for the video or cable/dish release."
4,A good comedy that gets better with each viewing,"Ocean's 12 stands on its own merits as a comedy and the funniest addition to the franchise. The dialogue is witty and fast paced. Repeat viewings or ""rewinds"" may be necessary to catch all of the gags. However, the height of the hilarity comes in the Tess impersonates ""Julia Roberts"" sequence, with Bruce Willis contributing to the lunacy!Add this to your collection if you want a movie that will make you laugh and smile throughout!"
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though the caper aspects of Ocean's Twelve are rather dissapointing, the amusing character interaction, several hilarious scenes, and an inspired gag involving Julia Roberts make this film worthy of a tepid recommendation."
1,A real 'sleeper' of a film,"The hard truth is ""Twelve"" put me to sleep a couple of times. I repeated the scenes I'd missed and wondered why I bothered afterward.The best part(s) of this film were Angelina Jolie and Julia Roberts. The Julia Roberts' mistaken identity scene was what earned this film a second star. I actually watched that one portion of the film twice and laughed both times.I'd strongly suggest you rent this movie before you consider buying it. If you like ""Ocean's Twelve"" there may be really good deals available for purchase."
3,What was going on?,"I loved Ocean's eleven. Nothing really original. A cheapo remake, but entertaining. Ocean's twelve is a sea of confusion. I left the movie play and did housework until it started to make sense again. Julia Roberts playing a psudo Julia Roberts is stupid."
1,"""Different feel: same Schtick!""","The only good thing about this movie was the laser dance scene. Otherwise, don't waste your time with this movie.If we really wanted to know what could happen after the fact . . .we would have asked for a sequel. I know I sure didn't. Sure, there were some techno scenes with cool gizmos but it all got lost in continuing personalities that seem to drag. All the characters have spent their money away, and that is understandable. If anything the movie is predictably bad."
1,GLOSSY STYLE NOT SUBSTANCE,"The numerous network interviews producer Jerry Weintraub gave at his architecturally audacious $40 million Big Horn home to hype OCEAN'S TWELVE (Warner) are perfectly in keeping with the tone of this glossy, star-studded sequel that's about style and attitude not much else. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.If you want to hang out with beautiful, globe-trotting (Amsterdam, Paris, and Rome), glib, conniving people who make contrived, cheeky small talk while planning a preposterous heist, then this escapist comedic caper is tailor made. ""Ocean's Twelve"" is silly, superficial, yet somehow vaguely entertaining."
2,Such a disappointment,"I saw Ocean's Eleven, and of course I loved it. This movie is nothing like that. Other than the cast and the word ""Ocean"", the two movies have nothing in common.Ocean's Twelve is every bad sequel you ever saw, rolled into one. The basic problem is that there isn't really much of a plot, nothing is ever explained, and it's all just a vague bunch of nonsense. The camera work is annoyingly and gratuitously artsy at entirely inappropriate moments, and the whole thing feels like an overly long TV sitcom.This is a bad screenplay, badly directed and poorly filmed. The good news is that the cast is magnificent.Overall, I would not recommend this film to anyone. It's a waste of your time and money."
1,Boring....,Put a bunch of stars together with a bad script to follow-up a decent original remake and what do you have? A boring moving with a stupid script.
1,What a waste of talent,"What were they thinking when they made this? You would think that with such an all-star cast that there would be no way that this movie could suck, but it does. Why bother having everyone come back to do a sequel only to leave most of them out of the script? Instead they showcase an unknown French actor (is he really French?) who does a dance routine which includes some break dancing, to elude a museum's laser security system. Like that hasn't been done before. I bet Catherine Zeta Jones gave him some pointers from her scene in ""Entrapment"". Anyway, this movie was so bad and boring that my 12 year old son went up to bed instead of staying up later than his bedtime to finish watching. I am so glad I borrowed this DVD from a friend because I would have been pissed if I shelled out 20 bucks for it."
1,One Word.........BLAH!,"Ocean's Eleven was a watchable movie, nothing to write home about but at least those involved didn't have to hang their heads in shame. This sequel however is one of the most uneven pointless sequels I've ever seen. The worst flaw of this film is simply put...it is BORING. There is also a really preposterous scene with Julia Roberts character playing Julia Roberts...maybe one of the dumbest things I've ever scene in a film. George Clooney and Brad Pitt walk through this movie acting like they're the coolest hippest dudes on planet earth, sorry chaps but the jokes on you, Matt Damon seems cooler than you two arrogant chumps put together. Dumb,dumb, and just dumb. The story is so mediocre and silly that it's no wonder the acting is sub par. The best thing about this movie is the nap you can take while it's on."
2,LSD: Lousy Soderbergh Directing,"This was a nightmare, right? I wasn't really watching the much-anticipated sequel to Ocean's Eleven, was I? How the hell does a director on top of his game like Soderbergh allow a sequel like this to be released? And you would think the actors would care enough about the movie and how the audience would perceive it to prevent a script so poorly formed and screened from making it to production. But, alas, it's greed that put this flick in the can. Definately the worst follow-up to a good film i've seen in a while."
3,One can only wonder,"With all the good actors/actresses in this movie. It seems like they spend more time focused a few of the ""alleged Ocean's Twelve"". Dont get me wrong i liked what the movie had to offer, but it doesnt really compare to Ocean's Eleven. It seemed more folks got the time to shine, not this time. We all know the premise/story behind this one. But with everyone in there from Bernie Mac, Julia Roberts to Don Cheadle. I just dont feel they got their due in this along with other actors as well. This one could've been so much better than it was. In my opinion it's just a little bit above average sequel."
2,BORRING.,"OCEANS TWELVE HAS NO VILONCE,WHATSOEVER.OCEANS ELEVEN IS MUCH MORE BETTER.I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD.I WAS WRONG.REALLY WRONG.IT JUST GOT A SLAP AND A WACK.I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS.IT'S ENTIRTAING,FUNNY BUT SOMEHOW IT JUST GETS DISSAPOINTING.I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.I HAVE THE DVD(OCEANS ELEVEN)AND I WONT GET THE SECON ONE.(YAY!!!!!!)BUT MY SISTER WANTS IT.BOO!"
2,THIS MOVIE WAS BOOORING. (and stupid),"Hooray for the criminals. They just stole YOUR money. Let's cheer them on, WHOOPEEE. The word that IMMEDIATELY came to my mind when I saw this was BOORING. There is practically NO action till the end of the movie. And when they pulled off 'The BIG STUNT"" I felt like falling asleep. Two really stupid things in the movie was Julia Roberts pretending to be Julia Roberts. That was just plain good ol fashioned STUPID. Brad Pitt thinks that he is hot stuff and comes across as annoying. Boring Movie that as Overrated-THE END"
3,Pretty Entertaining,"I liked it. Fun, shot like a film from the seventies. I wish more mainstream films were this much fun to watch"
3,"A decent, diverting caper flick -- and nothing more","Put aside for a minute the fact that Ocean's Twelve was undoubtedly made with the primary purpose of giving its A-list cast an excuse to lounge around in southern Italy for a few months. Put aside also the fact that this is a sequel to the decent (though unspectacular) Ocean's Eleven of a few years ago, which was itself a remake of an earlier (again unmemorable) star vehicle for Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack. The bloodlines of this franchise have been diluted more than European royalty.Take Ocean's Twelve for what it is: an entertaining heist movie with a fairly porous plot that nevertheless yields some good moments. High art it is not, but I found myself enjoying the ride while it lasted.There are a million reasons why this film shouldn't work, but the cast and crew do manage to pull a competent flick together in between the off-screen debauchery and carousing. Have fun with it; these guys certainly did."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting to see a witty film involving a well-planned heist. Instead I was totally confused. I kept asking my wife ""that doesn't make sense"" or ""what are they up to"". I had no idea what half the cast was up to. Why did they put the little guy in the duffle bag? What do they plan on doing with that egg? They could never sell it. The Night Fox wiggling through the lasers was a laugh. I rarely watch a movie for the stars, and they sure weren't a plus in this movie. There were a few nice location shots and not much else. I really enjoyed Ocean's Eleven , but this movie was just a mish-mash of through together scenes."
2,Lightning Doesn't Strike Twice,"""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) was great fun and a decided improvement over the Rat Rack's glorified 1960 home movie. Unfortunately, director Steven Soderbergh and his all-star ensemble fail to recapture the style and charm of the previous caper. Though not without its sporadic pleasures, ""Ocean's Twelve"" belongs in the Unnecessary Sequel category."
1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"At 52 I've seen and enjoyed many movies. Ocean's Twelve is a dog's dog of a movie. Terribly hard to follow, boring conversations, no action and a lifeless cast made for a dull evening."
3,Much better than I expected,"I'd read a lot of reviews about this one before seeing it. A lot of the complaints, such as the percentage of team involvement in the caper, are unjustified. Why give characters more screen time if it doesn't advance the story?It was enjoyable enough, if a little long, but the snappy dialogue makes the journey fun, the plot is interesting, and the master burglar's laser-avoiding dance is amazing. The team dynamic is intact from the first movie, and there are quite a few plot twists you don't see coming."
1,Absolutely horrible!,Why is it that great movies have horrible sequels?Ocean's 12 has good acting and nice scenes but the storyline and the plot don't match and live up to the standard set by Ocean's 11.
1,A HUGE DISAPOINTMENT,"OCEAN'S 12 DOSE NO JUSTICE TO 11. NOT ONLY ARE THE CHARACTERS PAPER THIN, BUT THIS MOVIE LACKS THAT ELEMENT OF EXCITEMENT THAT YOU EXPECTED. THE FILM HAS ITS WITTY MOMENTS, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO BRING IT UP TO A 'DESANT'MOVIE."
1,Don't waste your time,Predictable and without an ounce of originality. This movie was boring. Don't see this movie.
2,"11 was too little, hope 12 is enough...","Lets face it...Ocean's Eleven was a very weak movie. Great cast yeah...but...(this usually happens) did any of the BIG stars get more than 10 min on the film?Too expensive? Yes, of course having Academy Award winner Julia Roberts on screen for more than 10 min would cost a fortune but hey, you're making a BIG movie with BIG stars, so spend SOME money on it!!! Or just don't put her/his name first of all in the Trailer, making it appear like she/he's the main character...Yes, the movie was entertaining, but the story was really appalling and the development didn't take much...Just hope 12 is better than 11..."
1,Boooooooring !,"Like you, no doubt, I was lured in by the stellar cast, but the script is nothing more than a copycat of cat-burglar flicks from yesteryear. Nothing new here. Lost me in the first hour. Avoid."
1,A WASTE OF TIME !,"This is just an awful movie. The plot is incredibly lame and the premise, Andy Garcia finding the gang and sending them to Europe on a job, simply make no sense (why not just re-hide?).You know you're in trouble when Bruce Willis gives the best performance in the movie !"
1,"Horrible, stupid, Hollywood at it's worst","This film should be required veiwing at ALL film schools just too help students on what NOT to do. The film is 1. TOO long 2. Full of hubris (a great cast does not equal a good film) 3. Stupid and a mockery of the original (Julia Roberts plays a woman who looks like...Julia Roberts? This was dumb...I wanted to walk out at this point...)I think the people involved with this movie must hate their fans or something...why else make such a rip-off of a movie? I felt hurt by this picture. All I can say in the end is, see the first one, then stop!! Avoid this picture like the black death!!!"
2,It IS possible to be too eccentric,"Picture this, sitting in the front row seat in a theatre at 11:00 pm watching a moving where the first 15 minutes are literally the camera man ferociously shaking. Even though others may not of had the same experience as I did, no one will deny the mediocrity of this film. Here is a message to all movie directors and reviewers: It is possible to be too eccentric. Just like everyone else I found the first movie great, so much that I actually put it on my ""favorite movies of all time"" list. The problem with Ocean's 12 does not solely lie in its copious eccentrics, but also with its weak storyline and inadequate ending. I do applaud the makers of this movie for successfully getting all of the main characters back and a few new stars. I can't recommend that anyone buy this DVD, but if you found this movie in a garage sale with a price tag of $2.50, what the hell, take it."
2,another one with un-skippable adds,"The movie content is the movie content, think what you want of it.But the contents of the DVD itself are less desirable, no printed material, list of scenes/random blurb on the movie. The worst part is the adds/previews you have to sit through before the main menu loads, not something I want to put up with when watching something I purchased."
3,Warner Bros are the crooks here.,"Not seen this movie yet it only arrived mail order today but I feel cheated that the only extra feature is A theatricqal trailer. It sounds like the cast had a great time making this movie so why no behind the scenes making ofs or cast commentery? Well its probably because Warner Bros is planning to release a special edition 2 disc or bonus packed edition to milk film fans for more money instead of cheating people by releasing poor feature editions and then releasing the Special edition 2 months later try making a decision in mind of what the movie buying public want not what Warner Bros want in its walletts. Still I guess this is how they pay for oveer hyped and over budgeted failures that they seem to release like ""soldier"" 80 million spent on a sub "" Universal Soldier/Mad max"" rip off."
2,use your time to colour code your underwear drawer instead,"ocean's 11 was brilliant, which made me expect a similar standard from its sequel. But what I was presented with instead, was an overrated, over long,over dragged, boring film with such an unnecessary number of twists, that it was obvious the writer had placed them in the film assuming he could confuse critics 2 the point where they believed it 2 be a good film. Performances from all actors are not anything extroadinary either(though not bad) and I was shocked at how the big named cast could actually let this film go on for release, after viewing the finished project. Bottom line is- almost evryone I know who watched this sorry excuse for a sequel, fell asleep at some point during their torturous viewing."
2,Disappointing,"Before this movie came out, I was really excited to see it. I loved Ocean's Eleven because it was a cool, slick movie that was really fun to watch. I didn't feel that way about this sequel. I found that it was too hard to follow and didn't flow as easily as the first installment. The plot wasn't great, I didn't see why they had to pay him back in the first place; why didn't they just trick/decieve/evade him just like they did in the first one? There was way too much emphasis on paying Benedict back. In addition, there was no main heist as in the first one, so I found myself scratching my head as to what they were doing and why. The ending was really twisty, as well as total bull, but I'm not gonna spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. All in all, it lacked a lot of the smoothness that the first one had. The characters seemed very generic, and didn't have the personalities they had in the first movie."
3,I'm sorry,"Disliked this movie, two many people all talking at once, and I lost the story. George Clooney is a great actor, just not in this movie."
2,BORING,"Ok, this movie is really boring. Really it was. I had to struggle not to go to sleep. The first 1 was okish but this 1 was just plain old boring. If you see this movie be sure that you bring pillows and lots of snacks and stuff. Go to my website www.freewebs.com/jojo387/ ok. Well just remember this review and be careful its B-O-R-I-N-G! if your a parent: contains language and some drinking or whatever"
2,I would not buy this movie,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie. Then again, my expectation was high, because 1) I really enjoyed the first movie 2)all main characters cameback for the second movie. However, it was bad. I am still mad that I paid money to watch this movie in a theater. The story line sucks and ending is even worse. I would recommend renting the movie just so that you could say I saw it. However, paying $20 is not worth it. Save your money and buy the first one."
4,Ocean's Twelve,"Three years after pulling an impossible heist of a three-casino vault Daniel Ocean's Eleven plus wife Tess have been found and fingered by Terry Benedict. Mr. Benedict has promised the provider of the information to show restraint and give the clan two weeks to repay him with interest to the tune of over $190 million. Without a job that can provide that kind of pay off, the gang must accept the challenge of premier thief Francois Toulour to see who can steal a famous work of art first and claim the title of greatest thief ever. If you want to see a delightfully inventive artsy masterpiece Ocean's twelve is the one for you."
4,Not a bad sequel,I enjoyed 11 and I have to admit the first time I saw 12 I saw it on the tube about a quarter of the way into it. I didn't like it because I couldn't follow it. Once I saw it from the beginning the movie grew on me and I consider it almost the equal of 11.
3,"Fun to see all these stars together, movie too complicated","This movie has star power written all over it: Bratt Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, Matt Damon and even Bruce Willis made a surprising cameo at the end, so what is the problem with it?For me it gets to complicated, short scenes, too many of them and complicated tricks plot made for one hand enjoy the start for other try to make some sense of it, the end was almost pull out of nowhere so let you thinking what???For a fun time is ok, do not expect a lot, you will see big glomours hollywood stars, some inside jokes, beatiful locations and nice music."
3,"A completely different film than ""11""","If you go in expecting to see more of the same with ""12"", you will likely be disappointed. ""11"" is definitely easy and fun to watch. It is slickly produced and is very snappy. ""12"", on the other hand feels like an a-list art film. I was most surprised by the feel, fewer music cues, lighting choices, and camerawork which is far less ""commercial"" than its predecessor. I wasn't too impressed with the story or the performances but I admire Soderbergh for not making a stylistic duplicate of ""11""."
3,Set Sail (AGAIN),"Not nearly as interesting or funny as Oceans Eleven. Try as they might, the cast, and story line, just don't cut it."
2,Ocean's Eleven was better!!!!!!!!!!!,What a terriable movie this was. 1 1/2 star movie. Don't even rent/buy this movie cause It SuCkEd. g2g and this movie is F*cked UUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Mildly entertaining...,"I found Ocean's Twelve mildly entertaining, but a litte disjointed in several places. Compared to Ocean's Eleven it is ultimately dissapointing. One of those movies you watch once but wouldn't watch again."
3,Very entertaining,"I was told so many bad things about this movie not measuring up to Ocean's 11, and how terrible and over the top it was , that I watched it expecing this fake hollywood, action drama. Well that's not what I got out of it. It was very well thought out and entertaining. The Julia Roberts part was a little far-fetched, I have to admit, but overall, it was entertaining. The one problem that I can say I had with the movie was that this time around elven people just could not all play a major part in the movie like the first time. I can remember what each person's job in the first Ocean's, but this one left half of the characters literally unemployed (if you know what I mean). This time was about Brad, and Catherine-Zeta. But he is more than able to hold a movie by himself, along with a super-strong supporting cast, so I think it was a pretty good movie."
1,"This is a terrible, terrible movie.","This is terrible. Why would one make a sequel of a movie if there is no point to it! This is a terrible, terrible movie."
2,Watch this to cure insomnia.,"To the other commentary already posted in abundance, I'd only add that with so much monotone, dull, emotionless dialogue delivery, this movie is, at least, a cure for insomnia. I fell asleep twice trying to watch it, although I did catch the last 25 minutes, or so. And, that last 25 minutes was boring, too. Sigh(!) I'm glad I spent almost nothing for it, at the throwout kiosk in Walmart.I did give the ""movie"" two stars instead of one, which it deserved, because I enjoyed looking at a number of the European city scenes and period-sets. Very lovely, and a welcome distraction from the leaden, hum-drum diaglogue that just went on, and on.This really was sort of ""film party"", where a bunch of actors got together and simply had a good time while the cameras were rolling. I wonder if it was really intended to be a ""movie"" after all...."
1,Not a great sequal,"My honest opinion of this movie is that it stank. The transitions were ill-timed and I felt as if I were left out of the plot at many times in the movie. Oceans 11 was much easier to understand and is much better at showing the ""heist"" Don't see this movie unless you want to be left hanging with questions at the end."
1,"Frenetic,Fragmented,Overcrowded","Ya know what really grinds my gears?Take way too many good actors,overcrowded frenetic fragmented video scenes,a poor script,and a thousand over-ripe punchlines,cram it all together in one film and you get a Hell's Kitchen nightmare(horrible recipe) named Ocean's Twelve."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This movie should never have been made. It was dull and unispiring. The acting seemed forced and rather then everyone playing a part, a few characters were seen through out and nothing more. If you truly liked Ocean's 11 then leave it at that. My personal recommendation is that you do not watch this movie and rather just stick with the first film. You will be better off by far."
3,inferior sequel,"This sequel to Ocean's 11 pales in comparison. The same crew is back with the addition of Catharine Zeta-Jones and assorted other characters played by lesser known actors. This brings us to the first problem for this movie: too many characters to keep track of. Add to this a convoluted plot that jumps around too much in time and place and you have a frustrating movie to watch. More importantly, for a caper movie, there is very little capering going on. They plan a lot and talk alot but never really get around to doing anything. The movie is beautiful to look at, the people are lovely to look at, but the plot nevers goes anywhere. There are some funny scenes when the actors make fun of themselves in a very personal way and Topher Grace has a short, funny scene as himself. Overall, this movie was a misfire and with the considerable talent both in front of the camera and behind it, someone should have figured it out long before it made it to the theaters."
2,Unworthy Sequel to a Fun Caper Flick,"This one's a mess, folks, in so many ways. Throwing away the rather straightforward approach of Ocean's Eleven, the misguided filmmakers thought they would ""mix things"" up this time with a needlessly complicated and confusing sequel. What's lost in the process is the emphasis on the Ocean's Eleven characters so wonderfully developed in the first film, particularly those portrayed by Clooney, Reiner and Gould. You know there are problems when even ""star"" Clooney gets relatively little screen time. Brad Pitt and Matt Damon fare a bit better than the others, but they are also the least likable. Add to that a very self-conscious cameo by a big name star playing himself and you have an almost complete misfire. Worth a rental at your local Blockbuster on a slow evening, if only to play ""what the @#&^% is happening now."" Don't even bother considering buying this thing. You'll regret it."
2,Much Ado About Nothing!,"Much ado about nothing!The most exciting, the most interesting scene in this boring bomb of a sequel was when Ocean's French rival, Francois Toulour (Vincent Cassel) breakdanced through the security lasers, on his way to stealing that Faberge egg. Julia Roberts' character, Tess, impersonating Julia Roberts, fooling Bruce Willis (playing Bruce Willis) was also quite funny, and a relief from George Clooney and Brad Pitt hogging the camera, drinking wine."
2,Let's Hope We're Spared Ocean's 13,"A fair sampling of Hollywood's highest paid stars flew to Italy, set up a camera, and threw a party. It looked like they had a lot of fun."
3,Average Sequel,"I must give some credit, this sequel is better than most. It just wasn't Ocean's 11. It does test your observational skills, which is great :0) I would say rent it, but don't buy it. I did and I regret it because I will not be watching it again."
3,Worse than the previous oneWorse,"I prefer Oceans 11, this movie is good too but I don't like the role of Julia Roberts. This part was exaggerated a lot. Overall it is worth to see."
2,"No script, no chemistry, lotta famous actors","You can make a movie with no script. Casablanca was shot without one. You can make a movie with no name actors -- Star Wars for example. But without chemistry or script, all the name actors in the world can't help you.This is unitelligable, disconnected, with only a vague plot, and an ending that comes out of absolutely nowhere. Bleh. Two stars for ""I watched it to the end."" More's the pity."
4,Quite Good,"This is the sequeal to Ocean's Eleven, doesnt live up to the first, but a good sequel.Its about they have to give the money that they stoled back to the guy they stoled from and they have to steel some money so they wont die.I pretty much enjoyed it was quit good. 3.55/5"
1,Oceans 12 Very Disapointing,I saw it and it was really hard to under stand what was going cause it keep jumping around they shouldve not made oceans 12 there are some movies that can have a sequal this one was not one of them... DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE IT IS DISAPOINTING....
4,Cool criminal,"Come on people, loosen up! It's not a true story. I thought this one was just as good as the first one. Brad Pitt & Catherine Zeta Jones going back and forth in a steamy little tit for tat was fun. Again, great cast, great director, great story and great clothes! This one is also a winner!"
5,"The BEST Gabrieli Album, and McCreesh's Best, Too","""Music for San Rocco"" gives us a most generous collection of Gabrieli music(78 min.), beautifully performed and gorgeously recorded. The album as a whole is well paced, alternating the grand, the meditative and the purely instumental with intelligence and sensitivity. And the singing is always enthusiastic and downright rapturous!For me, this is also McCreesh's best album because it is not a reconstruction. I have heard several of these discs, and the reconstructions of Mass or vesper services might be interesting to listen to once, or maybe even twice if you have never been ot a genuine Catholic service of this sort. But frankly, liturgies, and liturgical chants are not entertainment, and generally are purely functional rather than entertaining. If you want just the real music on these discs, you have to program out 20-25% of the selections! More music and less turgid liturgical history for me, Paul!"
5,A Blue Light Special: Mr. Pinnock Demonstrates He's the Man!,"This CD proves that one should not always measure quality by the price tag. This CD was a bargain by classic CD standards, and it has provided me with immeasurable pleasure. This is a beautifully recorded CD. These works are played on authentic instruments, so even if you have these works in your collection, these versions add another dimension to Haydn's well known pieces. It may seem like relatively simple music, but that is its elegance. For those who are testing the classical music waters, you will find this music accessable and inspired. Pinnock and his ensemble are vivace and allegro without blaring and soothingly adagio without wavering or sounding weak. The musicianship is smooth, articulate, and tight. But, of course, it's Trevor Pinnock!"
3,"As Others Have Noted: Not Bad, Not Flashman","Enjoyable but hopelessly derivative of the Flashmans, these books are worth reading, but can't hold a candle to the sheer brilliance of Fraser's comic masterpieces. History fans will appreciate these-- Travers bumps into numerous historical figures and finds himself in the center of every dust-up, just like Harry Flashman. Don't expect too much and you'll enjoy the Fenwick Travers novels."
5,pokemon,"I will watch this while wearing pokemon clothes, sitting with my pokedoll, listening to the theme song, while playing pokemon on my ds."

3,Not a very good video,"This video is cute, but not what I would call a ""good video"" A good video has alot of action and stuff, but this does not have alot of action. It is boring."
5,Pikachu!,"Pokemon is one of the greatest shows for children everywhere to watch. I watched the show, and even though it's aimed for kids in the 2 to 6 age range, I just can't get enough. The sound quality is way better on video than in New Jersey, cause WPIX and my cable company don't transmitt the show in stero! If you can't watch Pokemon, rent the vidoes, and then buy them. {AND IF YOUR LOCAL STATIONS DON'T SHOW POKEMON, CALL AND REQUEST THAT THEY DO!!!}"
4,continuing the saga of Horatio in his adventures on the sea,"Hornblower is more mature, confident, and settled in his relationships. He continues to have razor-sharp instincts for military battles. Excellent storyline with continued attention to historical connections. I'll hate to finish the series."
2,Local Color,"The main interest for this production is that it was shot mostly on location in the vicinity of Juneau, Alaska around 1950. Some of the cinematograqphy is really quite good and, speaking as an Alaskan, very typical of the area. It would have been even more interesting from a nostalgia point of view were ther more scenes around Juneau itself. The preconceptions of the time about Alaskans, Russians, playboys, and lone wolf genius scientists are quite amusing. Denver Pyle is the only immediately recognizable actor although two other supporting actors are very good and worked almost constantly during the period. The leading man and lady are straight out of a Buster Crabbe serial while the plot doesn't quite rise to even that level. Were I not very familiar with the area and a fan of old science fiction and B-movies, I doubt that I'd have purchased this one."
3,Finally.... good!!!1,"I bought this movie thinking it was the movie Spielberg reviewed on the close Encounter's DVD special feature. I had a good and a bad surprise. It was definitely not a sci-fi movie at all, but rather a spy kind of movie. However considering that film is so old and so unpopular it does have is charm. I think the acting is good, the plot of the movie makes sense, and the scenes of Alaska are splendid. I have tons of DVD at home and somehow this film is one of my favorites. But then again... for my taste."
2,An Alaskan travelogue with inept spies,"This is primarily meant to be a cold war spy thriller, but the movie drags and the agents aren't very competent on either side. As the daddy of all flying saucer movies, this will be a disappointment to all but diehard film historians. Scifi fans should look elsewhere."
1,"Ugh, the worst ever!","This ""movie"" is B-A-D. I'm a big fan of cheezy sci-fi noir, and enjoy atomic-age paranoia movies, but this one scrapes bottom. I can't think of any aspect of it to recommend, except maybe the lady screaming. On second thought, I can recommend using this DVD as a wind chime, or maybe flinging it a barking dog. Too bad it can't be given a negative star to damp some of the more favorable reviews..."
3,A wonderfull version poorly remastered,"In LP all the Gieseking versions of the Emperor were among my favorites. The CD transcription is a great deception. The sound saturates in all registrars, the orchestra sound is thinned and ugly, however some of the beauty survives."
2,much lighter pink than pic,"I was really disappointed with the color of the ""ruby"" stones! I knew they would be a little light for this price, but the ones I received look more like Pink Tourmaline than rubies!! Very disappointed..."
2,Pretty but not as expected,I bought this earing to gift it to my Sister-in-law... Its cute but it doest sparkle as shown in the picture..In the picture the stone s are very dark in color but the one i got is not as bright as i expected to be... The design is nice..
4,"Cute, tiny.","Cute, quite tiny, though. Also the ruby is rather opaque: expected for the price, but the ruby in the picture looks better than the actual product. Still, good value for the price."
5,Great earrings,"These are so light you can hardly tell they're in and I get lots of compliments when I wear them. Very cute! The only downside is one of mine has an area where they were poorly put together and it tends to pinch me when I put it in. Once in, I really like them!"
5,My new favorites,"Ruby is my birthstone. I've never had real rubies but always wanted some, so I took a chance on the one 5-star review that was already posted, as well as the bargain price. I'm so glad I did. These earrings are simply beautiful. They are tiny (be sure to check out the measurements listed), but you have to expect that for precious gems at this low price. They are still big enough to be seen and admired--I would call them a delicate size. They are subtly beautiful and perfect for my style, which is not flashy, garish, or look-at-me. As the description states, they are opaque, PINK-RED stones. The hinged lever-back clasps are sturdy and tight. I love the color--it's not quite fuchsia or magenta, but note that they are NOT PRIMARY RED. I'm using a Dell monitor, and the color is reproduced exactly on it. The center diamonds (diamond ""chips"" I believe) are minuscule but still add sparkle--the entire setting sparkles delightfully under incandescent lighting."
1,Tarnishes in just 5 months!!,Would you imagine that the workmanship could be so poor that it the gold plating wears off in just 5 months? Well this pair of earrings have already tarnished and are un-wearable. They have been carefully placed in their original container and have never been worn. I purchased this item as a gift and am yet to present it to whom it was intended for. It seems like I'll have to toss it away.On calling Amazon today they were good enough to provide some promotional credit but they could not accept a return18k Yellow Gold Plated Sterling Silver Ruby Flower Dangle Earrings
2,Pretty but didn't hold up...,"I really liked these earrings, but both were lost when the leverbacks stopped locking in place after just a couple months of use."
3,Bling,They are as advertised but are dissappointedly quite dainty (small). I would have still bought them but a photo with a reference like a dime would have eliminated over expectations.
2,Too small to see!,"I was so disappointed with these earrings that I am returning them. I always figure that the picture has been enlarged, but these are miniscule! You can't even tell what the design is."
4,Good fit for my 2 year old daughter,"I was looking for small and beautiful earrings for my 2 year old daughter. She is looking really cute with these earrings. Only problem I have is, one earring's connection is loose and sometimes it comes out."
4,Very Pretty Mini Poinsettias,These earrings are very pretty. I am very pleased with the size (they are not overly big and dangle nicely) A nice addition to any little girl's start up jewelry box
3,This Book is a Misnomer,"When I bought this book, I was looking forward to a tale focusing on B'Elanna Torres and an explanation of her conflicted emotions and past. I was disappointed. The first few chapters discussed the Day of Honor, but once they land on the planet it is forgotten and the story becomes a typical episode of the show! In fact, the show handled Day of Honor better in its episode dedicated to the topic! There were scenes that stood out in my mind. Torres holding her own and earning the respect of her fellow prisoners then leading them on a grand escape was worth the buy and well-written. I also liked seeing Torres and Kim together. Their friendship is rarely explored in these books. The plot was interesting and the characters had potential. I think this book is good, but it should stand on its own and not be part of the Day of Honor series."
2,Gagh it ain't...,"This book has it's entertaining moments - mostly, they're confined to the 1st and 2nd chapter, where B'Elanna has to endure the Day of Honor good wishes of her colleagues.What disappoints about this book is how poor the characterisations are - they feel off. Janeway definitely comes across as a bit inept and rather silly, Tom Paris comes in at the start and end (this is pre their relationship days I guess) although B'Elanna is about 60% there in terms of her portrayal. What's missing is the spark, that extra juice that makes Torres such a cool character.The plot is okay only and the Day of Honour feels more like a calender coincidence than a real plot driver or revealing of any true character. B'Elanna's discomfort about Day of Honour is confined to how her previous DOH seem to have been like bad luck days for her.For a better effort at B'Elanna having a bad day, the Voyager Episode 'Juggernaut' works."
2,Klingon Soul? P-lease!,"No, this is *not* the character piece on B'Elanna that it claims to be. It's just another plot-driven story of ""Voyager crew in jeopardy, let's find a way to save them at the last possible second."" I would have found it more compelling if Torres's alien acquaintance from the planet (sorry, forgot his name) would have actually--gasp--*died*! But in the world of Star Trek, we can't have that. Oh well--we could have seen B'Elanna's reaction to his death ""as a warrior""... and maybe even some real insight into her Klingon soul."
4,Excellent Book!,This is the first book I have read by this author. Now I'm hooked on this series. Great read.
3,Well-written but historically naive,"This book is well-written and easy to read. It tells an excellent story. The only weak spot is that McCullough paints Caesar as a ""good guy"" who just wanted to clear his name when he invaded his own country and overthrew the lawfully elected government. This is naive. She accepts, without skepticism, the statements of those historians who apologized for Caesar. She does not seem to realize that what happened in Rome in 50 B.C. was a classic military coup. The toughest general (Caesar) used his troops to take power. He is really not much different from General Pinochet or Colonel Quaddafi."
3,This wonderful series seems to be running out of steam.,"I have read and passionately enjoyed all five of McCullough's ""Masters of Rome"" novels -- but I am sorry to say that in ""Caesar"" the quality of her writing (never a strong point) has declined to the level of pulp fiction. Sentence fragments, cliches, and repetition abound. Characterization has declined to practically nil. The only thing that kept me going was my fascination with Roman history, politics, and military science -- and in this area, McCullough continues to amaze me with her meticulous research. She would be well-advised, however, to remember that these books are supposed to be novels -- and novels need strong plots and characters to keep them going. Coasting on Caesar's ""Commentaries"" is cheating. I sincerely hope she puts some more time and effort into ""The October Horse."""
3,Much better than Caesar's Commentaries!,"McCullough sure made me feel as though I was inside the tents with Caesar's generals, putting together the Gallic Campaign. I enjoyed her feel for explaining and re-telling Roman warfare. I question the characterizations of Antony and Cleopatra in this book. I don't seriously think that Antony would've gotten as far as he did had his character in real-life been as much of a ""butt"", as McCullough describes. He was actually one of Rome's most gifted orators, and a brilliant cavalry officer. And, though most historians agree that Cleopatra was not as beautiful as the vamps on the silver screen, she could'nt have been ugly, or Caesar and Antony would have done Octavian's job for him!"
3,"Wonderfully written and presented, but lacking","In many ways this is a great book, if not the best in the Masters of Rome series. However, what really rubs me the wrong way is Colleen McCullough's angle. I'm sorry, but I just don't think Julius Caesar's intentions were quite as innocent as she presents them to be. If you can get past this, you're definitely in for a rare treat."
4,Ancient history told with normal human nature in mind.,"What an enlightening book about those ancient Roman times, told in a way depicting the people with human emotions similar to ours. This series brings me into the time in a way which I can relate to as a modern(?) day individual. I only wish there were quick reference pages to show all the characters & their relationships & family tree. I sometimes get lost in who's who, especially if the name hasn't been mentioned in a while. Great, entertaining reading. I am anxiously awaiting the next book. I hope it comes out soon before I forget who is who!"
4,Caesar - A must in the epic saga of Rome,"Maybe ""Caesars women'"" was more juicy, maybe ""The Grass Crown"" was more gripping, but I enjoyed this book as much as any on the subject. This period in the roman history is a prelude to, or even the beginning of the imperial era. The gallic wars for all their fame did not have a good novelised version. I wished I had had this before having to translate De Bello Gallico as a student some years ago: it would have put it into perspective!"
5,GREAT,Caesar is on of the best books I've read. It got me to read the other books in the series. It gives a very good account of life and the history of ancient Rome. It is a must-read.
2,Good history...bad writing,"This novel was extremley boring. I have also read the first man in rome and these two novels share many simmilarites. Both have terrible writing, both have underdeveloped characters, and the most important one of all, THERE BOTH BORING. I found it near immpossible to get into the story, or care about the characters in any way. I can only recommend this to big history buffs, or people that worship Colleen McCullough."
2,If it weren't for Margaret George....,Laden with historical information and obsessions of one Marcus Antonius's. The only interest that this book held for me was to give further historical insight into the world which Margaret George brought to life in 'The Memoirs of Cleopatra'.I think that the book suffered from over extension.. i.e. there was just too much information about too many people being crammed into an average sized novel. The book could have just as aptly been titled Pompey the Great....
4,"A fun I, CLAUDIUS prequel","For those of us non-scholars who loved I CLAUDIUS, this is another great historical novel.While not quite a stand alone work (you really must know some Roman History to enjoy this book) it is an engrossing recreation of some of the last years of the Roman Republic.Details of the Roman Senators' maneuvers against Caesar have some very interesting parallels with the recent mayhem in Washington, D.C. Surely this must have been the author's intention!I'm hooked, and now I'm off to read the others in the series.Note: There are an alarming number of typos in this edition. The author has done such a wonderful job of research--you'd think a few more copy editors would check things out before it went to mass market printing."
3,Average re-telling of Gallic wars.,"My opinion of this novel is that the book was average and hard to get through. In a word, it was not as entertaining as I thought it might be and was disappointed by the constant references to the Commentaries of the Gallic wars. Don't get me wrong, I like Roman History, but Caesar was dry. It sometimes reads like a translation and with another book that focused on story rather than history at the ready I may have picked an alternative. If you've got a big test on Roman History coming up and you need to study, then pick this book. Otherwise, watch a soap."
2,Stuck in the mud!,"This recording of the Rachmaninoff Third is strange indeed! There are arbitrary tempo choices and fluctuations that seem to make no musical sense, and give little respect to the score. The slow movement, and certain lyrical parts of the first movement are so heavy handed that the momentum simply gets ""stuck in the mud!"" It seems as though the musical ideas are intellectually conceived and not felt emotionally, as if to say, ""let's play this passage really slow, because no one else has played it that way before."" In my view, that's boring music making at its worse! No comment on the Bartok (which, contrary to layman's opinions that are based on a recent movie, is a far more difficult work technically), as it isn't strong enough to recommend buying the recording. However, it's a slightly stronger performance than the Rachmaninoff. My advice, bypass this one..."
3,Did not use it,"I purchased this item, but unfortunately it did not fit. The cost of returning it is more that the cost of the item so I still have it...."
1,We never got our product!!,"I saw this listed as purchased items to review. We never got this item though! Not sure why it's listed here and if we did indeed buy it, where it is!"
4,This bag will last forever!,"When you only need a little bit to create a nice thick consistency, a 1 lb bag will last a very long time. I use it in place of cornstarch to make gravies, sauces, dressing and soups thicker. There is no flavor and it doesn't clump. After realizing how little I need per use, I wish I would have purchased a smaller amount but now I'm set for quite some time!"
4,Darkly Humourous,"This is the first of Bowen's novels I have read and I was quite interested in the two polarised reviews below me, one reckoned it her best, and one reckoned it her worst book. Strange how writing can be so different to so many people.I really enjoyed it - it was darkly humourous. We are introduced to Eva Trout and her unstoppable machinations right from the start - her inability to leave things alone, and perhaps more importantly, other people's inability to get her to leave them alone. It really is enormously funny at times - a mischevious social comedy and with a nice suitably bizarre twist for the finish."
1,"Greed... Pure, Unadulterated Greed","I have to agree with reviewer Smokey on this one. This release is a joke. Do everyone a favor and pass on this one. Don't encourge studios to censor the first release of a series on DVD only to release it ""uncut"" later. The special commentary tracks included here were left off the volume 1 and 2 sets. I'm sure FOX was saving them for an opportunity to make more money."
1,buy it at wal mart for $5,"first i'd like to say family guy is way overrated. just as the writers of south park so aptly put it, the writers of family guy are freakin lazy and unimaginative. i mean, come on... it's obvious mcfarlane has never put the effort into creating a coherent plot for his episodes. any fool with half a lick of talent can create a cartoon that consists of ""flash backs"" and music numbers strung together with no real purpose or message behind them... not to mention the fact that half of the episodes just copy the plot and characters from other well known shows/movies (e.g., willy wonka and the chocolate factory, the twilight zone, etc.).that said, don't buy this family guy dvd. it's not freakin' sweet because family guy freakin sucks. however, if you must by it, go to wal mart. they sell this piece of garbage for about $5."
3,How do you watch these?,"One thing I have to laugh about is that all of these reviewers have ""seen"" the DVD to either praise it or dis it long before it's even out on the shelf. I really have to ask you, where are you getting the DVD and watching it to review it with your praise or hate?"
2,Not really fully uncut,"There is still a scene missing in Road to Rhode Island with the marriage videos that still remains out of the episode, even though they say it is uncut and uncensored. I got this as a gift because I had wanted it, but it was a 3 second clip of Osama. Kinda dissapointed, wouldn't have spent [...] on it."
4,Extra features worth the exra money?,"This is a dvd set of 5 episodes: road to rhode island, leathal weapons, when you wish upon a weinstein, to love and die in dixie, and i am peter hear me roar. All of the episodes on the disc are some of the bes if not the best episodes in family guy's 3 seasons. But what really makes this DVD worth buying if you already have the other two DVD sets are the extra features. The set includes behind the scene looks at both American Dad(A new show from the creator of family guy) and a look at the upcoming 4th season of Family Guy. The set also includes new comentary from the creators and an exclusive comentary by Brian and Stewie on Road to Rhode Island. The last special feature is an interview with Seth McFarlane the creator. Overall its the extra features that make the DVD worth buying, if you want to laugh and have a good time this is a DVD must have."
3,ok,"the disc was ok it was worth the money to see the uncut footage.but you can find the other episodes on the boxed sets.but pretty funny show though, it would be a good christmas present...."
2,What a ripoff!!,"If FOX released just the uncensored version of ""Road to Rhode Island"" for $5.00 (as someone suggested), I might be willing to buy it.Forcing someone to buy DVD for a restored scene is just ripping the fans off.If you're a fan, you've already have the boxed sets. If you're not a fan, this DVD will not change your mind.So, who is FOX trying to convert?"
3,good for begenners,"they made this for those who just started watching family guy for the die-hard there arent real new things exept bonuses.if you are a big fan you probably saw these epidodes many times or even have them on dvd.there is an american dad peak and a look at the 4th season like what will hapen and stuff.if you are starting maybe get thisbefore a full season set unless you are sure of your choice.they have a good selection of episodes but if you have vol 1-2 dont bother buing this unless its for a collection.hight points;great for beggeners and it got the season 3 unaired episode,lowlight;not that good for die-hards.it really is for startes in the family of family guy so it mostly is basics so i cant give it more than 3 stars."
4,Freakin' Sweet!,"This DVD is Freakin' Sweet. Thus, the title. If you are a owner of the season sets this DVD has five episodes from the season sets. The only new thing is an extended version of ""Road to Rhode Island"". It is only extended like three minutes. The special features are a Family Guy Season 4 sneak peak, a Sneak Peak for ""American Dad"", and a speech by Seth McFarlene. This DVD is over-all, OK."
3,Fun read,"This is a cute book. It gives some insight into the thinking of Canadians. It's mostly just for fun, but now I see what letters they drop, so the overall idea should help next time I hear a Canadian speaking rapidly!"
4,A classic,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son to watch on our portable DVD player on a trip from Georgia to Pennsylvania. Let's just say, I can recognize which cartoon is playing from the music. He loves the 14 cartoon collection. The set also comes with 2 movies, but he prefers the cartoons. Would rather have purchased without the movies, but he may like them when he is older. This is such a classic cartoon; my husband and I enjoy watching it with him and his 14 month old sister is begining to enjoy it as well."
2,Mickey Mouse functionality,The screen is very nice and the push screen is kind of neat but it sometimes can accidentally go the wrong direction. It takes forever to charge and you have to use the usb cable to charge unless you buy the option a/c cable. I think it is compatible with Windows Media 10 and now Media 11 is already out. Navigating through the screens is tiresome and is very tricky to memorize the features. Oh yeh and the headphones are pitiful. I think it's got the right idea but there are more user friendly MP3's out there. PS- the optional cradle is worthless but cool looking.
3,Bad Engish VHS Tape,"It's a very short tape. But if you're a fan of this short-lived band, then it's worth getting scince this tape and the two CD's are about the only pieces of Bad English merchandise available.The tape is simply five music videos from the original Bad English album from 1989. Those videos are: ""Best Of What I Got,"" ""When I See You Smile,"" ""Heaven Is A 4 Letter Word,"" ""Price Of Love,"" and ""Forget Me Not."" Each video has short introduction by a band member. My wife and I had ""When I See You Smile"" as our wedding song, so although we have it on CD, we had to have it on video too.Too bad they didn't wait until after the second ablum in 1991 for this tape, so they could have added a few videos from that one two. I also wish there would have been a video of ""Possesion"" on this tape. But still, it's worth getting if you can get it for a good price."
2,Poor Translation,"I admire Cicero and and I like THE NATURE OF THE GODS, but I give it 2 stars because of the poor translation, which renders a lucid book intolerably boring. So, please throw away the PENGUIN edition and check out the same title by OXFORD WORLD'S CLASSCIS translated by P.G.Walsh. After you have compared the two editions, you will realize the weakness of J.M.Ross' translation."
1,A Little Dry,"I found the book informative while reading it, but also a bit confusing and a little dry, best used for a college course and not for recreational reading. (Which is no doubt why we even had it in our house, someone had to use it and it's equally boring companion for some college course, I'm certain of it...)"
4,I like it very much,the book content is excellent. I received the book in a reasonable time from placing the order. Some of the pages in the book were not in good shape.
4,"Comprehensive biography of Churchill's youth, but at times too minutely detailed.","This book is almost a thousand pages long and gives a lot of very specific information about the man and his life to the extent that the reader can get bogged down by too many facts. Nevertheless, it's a fascinating account of a man who changed the course of history during the 20th century. I'm not a huge history or biography buff, but am totally engrossed in this book!"
3,Malt machine,I would have liked the metal cup to be taller. When making the malts there was a mess to clean up because the malt splashed out of the short cup.
5,Beautiful Red Hamilton Beach Drink Mixer,WOW!! This mixer not only matches all of the red Hamilton Beach appliances we have but it surpassed our expectations. Works great and we're having fun making all sorts of delicious milkshakes. Thank you for fast delivery and an efficient transaction.
4,"Unique product, average quality.","I use mine as a vehicle iPod-like dock for my cellphone. The cord is a bit short for my use (I think its less than the 40"" specified), it limits the volume a bit, but you can not find this anywhere else. The sound quality is excellent, and the tiny plug has taken quite a bit of abuse without visable damage.The microphone is not great, with low volume and average to low sensitivity."
3,The book was better the second reading,"The atmosphere in the book doesn't match that of ""Curfew."" However, it is NOT badly written. It just isn't as exciting as the first book. Whether it is better than ""December"" will remain a matter of personal choice. The book does teach a bit of Welch, and it does get better on subsequent readings. Those who enjoy Phil Rickman will enjoy this, but it might be better to buy it used at a yard sale."
1,Candlenight,"I bought this book because the story line was intriguing. It ended up being far from anything that I had expected. I enjoyed being introduce to Wales, but the book was a catastrophe. I kept having to go back and re-read to see if I had missed something, because I couldn't figure out how the author had gotten where he was. The only way you will enjoy this book is if you are looking for something to pass the time (time seemed to drag the entire time I was reading it). I can't believe I forced myself to finish it, but I kept hoping that something would happen that would justify the time and money spent. The book ended, but the story seemed like it was laying ground for a sequel. I hope that the author has the sense to leave it where it died."
4,No Welcome Mat Here,Rickman picks up the old chestnut about the creepy small town that doesn't cotton to strangers and recreates it in a Welsh village. The English are apparently trying to turn Wales into their Florida and the Welsh resent it. The English who come to Y Groves have to worry about more than thugs. They face a murderous cult and their black magic.I was so creeped out by the book that I had to lay it down a week before finishing it. I consider this one of my favorite Rickman thrillers.
5,My Favorite Phil!,"Hands down, this is my favorite of all of Rickman's books. I have read them all after literally dicovering CURFEW behind a stack of paperbacks at a bookstore. If you are thinking about reading his work, I highly suggest this story to get you addicted to the rest!"
2,cheap at half the price,"first of all major parts are hopelessly( well perhaps not hopelessly ) warped with chunks of body simply torn out.altough I am not finished matching parts this is going to be a lulu getting it together, definitely wish I had spent the extra for the Tamiya. One other notecertain plastic parts of importance are flimsy particularily for 1/32 scale. Finally there is no detail to speak of and certainly no add-on bits.2 stars because eveything made it to the box"
2,Please! Not another snow sex scene,"Creighton's One Christmas Knight is an okay read especially if you like a good ol' Southern trucker delivering a baby at a rest stop in the middle of a Texas Panhandle blizzard. Actually, it's a pretty good story and a believable variation on a different kind of ""virgin"" birth. The Bevarly section, Jake's Christmas, uses the tried and true plot of the poor boy who grows up, makes good, and becomes a misogynist because of his divorce. The instant passion between Jake and Rebecca is also tried and true, but please...has anyone ever really undressed partially or wholly to have a secxual encounter in the snow? Maybe snow is different in Kentucky than in Kansas but it gets cold here. I quit Bevarly at that point - the story was not worth my time to finish."
4,Paint Portraits,I find this book to be very useful im many ways...colouring ideas also good information and examples on drawing the body
3,Good book for a beginner,I ordered this book sight unseen( a mistake) because of Amazon recommendation and glowing reviews.Its not terrible but I am not impressed with the content.The artist is not nearly as strong as many other portrait painters who have written texts.Her drawings tend towards the mediocre and formulaic. Her paintings are splashy but fail to cover her flaws in understanding form.The information presented is basic and general with the exception of the color mixing section which is quite useful.
4,cheap but high quality lighter,"I bought this item several months ago. it is working pretty good. i did not give full score because there is better zippos, but they are expensive. overall, this worths the money you pay, and charismatic lighter when you light cigarattes of girls"
5,Shockingly good,"This book, which highlights a fairly outdated version of Adobe Premiere Elements, is nevertheless extremely useful. After reading the reviews of newer versions of the Premiere Elements software, I decided to stick with 2.0 until I become much more adept at video editing. For a relatively small purchase price, this book will definitely be a huge help for me. Because it is: a) task oriented, b) easy to understand, c) contains intuitive links to other tasks, d) is well organized by section number, this book is highly consumable. I can't recommend it highly enough. Actually, as painful as this sounds, it may be worth toughing it out for a few weeks with the Adobe documentation that comes with the product, and then turbo-boosting your success with this book. Incidentally, the fact that the editors have bona fide video production chops versus tech writing skills was not lost on me!"
4,"Photos with color larger type , and a DVD to follow would help a lot","A good Book in general but I did find the photos of the screens could have been larger (print was hard to read) and in color. It would have been nice to have a DVD or cd with a tutorial to follow. Tricks section was good and more would be even better. In general it was clear and easy to follow but some of the sections needed to be beefed up a bit. Better book then Adobe Premiere elements for Dummies (which is only version 1 not 2). Would have liked to see a section on ""Moving on to Adobe Premiere Pro"" - difference, advantages and learning curve expected. Also more on how to use the multiple tracks."
2,This is not real Scriabin,"It seems all these reviews are written by Pletnev admirors. I greatly admire Pletnev's brilliant recordings of Scarlatti, Beethoven variations, C.P Bach, Chopin, Liszt etc, but his Scriabin is a real letdown. His playing does not lack delicacy and poetry. Preludes are played beautifully with his usual fluency, but it sounds rahter prosaic. As for sonatas and late works, he completely fails to capture the sense of mystery, etherial beauty and spirit of the music.If you are after Scriabin played with real depth and spiritual force, you must listen to Sofronitsky, Richter and Horowitz. Then you will know how shallow Pletnev's interpretation is."
4,Good but not great,"I don't actually own this album, but I listened to all the free samples. The preludes were very capably and artistically performed, but I can't give this five stars because the Sonata #4, one of my absolute Scriabins, is not handled very well at all. My Steuerman recording is miles ahead of this one; Pletnev's second movement is neither ""prestissimmo"" nor ""volando"", and he takes too many liberties that I just don't think Scriabin would have approved of. Still good preludes, though."
5,The Spaniard,"Great book for kids, beautiful ilustrations and coloring. The Pop ups will delight your kids!!! Great gift idea."
4,"for only one track, i bought this.","the song 'slowly' was enough for me to buy this entire cd, and yes i try my absolute hardest to buy every original copy of cd album or single for every song(s) i cherish on them. i believe in having an authentic copy of music...didn't care about the other tracks on 'from roots...' to be honest. i only uploaded 'slowly' to my itunes...if you're not like me then at least buy the mp3. it's the track for every electronica music lover's collection."
4,doing good is harder than you think,"Not having read Morsi before, I was unencumbered by expectations of a pure romance novel. What I discovered was a very readable story about a very likable character struggling to grow into the person she would like to be. Having made a promise to God, under extreme circumstances, to do good for the rest of her life, Jane finds that to be easier said than done. Her idea of doing good doesn't always work. But, persistance pays off and, despite some trite coincidences in the story line, the author gives us an enjoyable yet thought provoking woman's story."
4,"Departure, but a good one","Pamela Morsi departs from her usual genre with this story of a woman living on autopilot until a near death experience. While some of the outcomes are telegraphed well in advance of the ending, the characterization is strong, the message important, and the story compelling...better living through clarity, charity and self knowledge. While I'm not personally a brittle society wife, there were many moments that resonated in the heroine's life. If you liked Patricia Gaffney's genre transition, or enjoy mainstream woman's fiction, Doing Good is well worth the time. I'd label this one a must read of the year."
1,"Back To The Drawing Board, Pam","I always thoroughly enjoyed Pamela Morsi's historical novels. However, her attempts at contemporary fiction focusing on women's issues are feeble. The humor, characterization, and fun are gone. Instead, I detect an agenda of which I neither approve nor appreciate.Until she returns to her classic style, I think I'll spend my money elsewhere."
3,slow and not as moving as the title implies,"I found this book to be quite boring. There isn't very much happening throughout. I was looking for an inspirational moment or something to counteract the slow pace, but was hard pressed to find one."
3,doing ok,"I guess I expected more, after taking someones own comments into consideration. It was a pleasant story, but pretty predictable."
5,One to Remember,"Here is a classic recording -- and a musical revelation. This is the CD for those who don't know or don't like Karajan, who don't know or don't like Britten, and who don't think they can tolerate mono sound. This is repertoire that Karajan never re-recorded -- perhaps because he could hardly imagine bettering the artistic success or emotional impact of these interpretations. The Britten is grippingly intense -- the funeral march variation will stay with you long after listening -- even as the Vaughan Williams is eerily soothing. (The Stravinsky is an add-on that is almost inconsequential.) The effect of the excellent mono remasterings is to create a strangely dream-like aura that is somewhere between mono and stereo (some might say that Walter Legge's genius was to create his very own sound) and fits perfectly the mood of these works. The music emerges clear, as if from a distant haze, and will not easily be forgotten. A record for the ages."
1,A book that shouldn't have been written...,"A friend of mine sadly wasted his money on this book in the expectation that it might actually be worth reading, but just like everything else Pat Blashill writes, It sucked. I am saddened deeply, as well as embarrased to say I actually wasted the time reading some of it. Pat Blashill can't write Rolling Stone reviews, so of course she sure as hell can't write a book..."
1,Anything Alternative to this,"Misunderstood tripe parading itself as a journal of ""Alternative Music."" Punny, Unfunny title... quickly veers into unreadability. Stick to the acurate Rolling Stone reviews, Pat..."
1,Pat needs to go back to writing children's books....,Absolute garbage.... Don't even think about wasting your money on it.......
3,"good game, cheap construction",Good game but I would buy a different set. The decals on the cups are just stickers that dont line up and are even crooked.
1,Not what is pictured!,"I ordered this because the picture showed the dice cups to be a soft oval shape that I could store easily and they wouldn't hurt my table by all the turning of the cups. When this arrived, it what not what was pictured. I received 4 SHORT ROUND dice cups of 2 DIFFERENT sizes made of a very thick hard plastic. Also one of the dice was missing which I cannot find as they are of a very small size."
1,"Boring, Uncreative Gameply","Liar's Dice is a pretty straightforward game. Each player rolls a set of dice, conceals his or her roll from the others, and makes a bid as to outcome of the total roll. Each subsequent bid has to be higher than the previous; or, alternatively, a player can challenge another's bid. If a person's bid is challenged and proven false, he or she loses a die. The goal of the game is to be the last person to lose all your dice.The rules make for a frustrating and unsatisfactory game in which the player doesn't really feel in control of what is happening. If you do the math, counting the dice total and the probability of any particular face appearing, you realize that it's not very hard to figure out whether a person is lying or not. But since each player can only bid up or challenge another's bid, gameplay becomes a fairly mundane and uncreative task of knowing when a person's bid is mathematically unlikely."
3,Nice Box,"Overall a good game about bluffing with diceThe Good:>Enjoy having it in my arsenal of game>Nice boxThe Not So Good:>Cups come in 2 different sizes, 2 smaller cups that fit into the 2 medium cups>Sticker design on the cups"
1,not what i expected,the box it came is it nice but the dice cups are not good the paper is supose to be wraped around the cup but the paper is hanging off and the cups are just not nice.
2,Dice cups are not wood and not exactly as pictured,"dice cups are a cheap plastic with the black felted lining coming off, but wood die that holds everything is nice shipping was superfast."
1,Not what you get,After receiving the product and opening it I found that it was not quite what they had pictured in the advertisement. First the shakers look like something a 6 year old made in art class. They look more like a clay change holder then a dice shaker. where as the picture look to me like standard 3 inch oval shakers. Then their are dice themselves they are so small that the 6 side is almost completely blacked out with dots. The only cool thing about this game is the giant Dice carrying case thing.
2,"The classic game is fine, but this particular package is poorly built.","This is the classic game of liars dice. The package includes a die-like box with different sized throwing cups and dice. There is not much too it. The cups cascade to make them easily storable inside the box, but the smallest cup is almost too small. The stickers shown on the outside of the cups peel off almost instantaneously.Overall, the build quality of everything inside the box is low. Initially, the box is a cute addition to a game shelf, but it ends up just taking up a lot of space.If you want this game, just get dice anda few cups. Don't bother with paying for the fancy box."
1,"One star, not for the book but for the deceptive labeling","This kindle book is NOT ""A Journey to Mars"" by Gustavus W. Pope. It's actually ""A Columbus of Space"" by Garrett P. Serviss.It may be a great book, for all I know; I haven't read it yet. But I do not appreciate being duped."
1,A Tale of Two Children,"This is a dreadful little book about the downslide of a great artist and the parasite who attached herself to him like a barnacle. Ruth Kligman has never shown even an ounce of talent for anything on her own, and continues to try to live off the carcass of an artist who, by the time she met him, was on the dark side of a distinguished career. What possible motive could there be for a book that portrays the Big Dripper as a big drip? How could she evince so little feeling for the friend she lost in the tragic accident that claimed Pollock's life? What could this possibly do for his legacy but harm it, as it portrays him as a drunken, self-absorbed infant given to weeping fits and artistic impotence? Kligman gives new meaning to the phrase ""with friends like these""--regarding both her dead friend and Pollock."
1,Still trying to cash in after all these years,"A poorly written, self-serving book written by a bit player who is still feeding on Pollock 47 years after his drunken, ignominious death. Pathetic."
5,6-10 Year Olds Will Love It!,"CB Colby wrote a whole string of books in the late 50's to early 70's that basically targeted younger boys. The books dealt with topics from 'Arms of our Fighting Men' to ""Ships of Our Navy"". Each of the books is around ~60 pages, and shows excellent pictures of various arms and weapons, with a paragraph or 2 for each page written for a youngster to understand.I loved these books when I was in grade school. They are very dated, and all the systems obsolescent, but my kids love looking at these books."
3,Handel Coronation Anthems,"After seeing the movie ""Young Victoria"", I was struck by the music as she walked down the aisle for her coronation, as well as excerpts at various times. I found that the first music was Handel's 'Zadok the Priest'. This album has good renditions of the four coronation anthems, and additional music of Handel. I would prefer a CD that has more presence of the choir on the anthems, but this version is pleasing to the ear.'"
2,Say Noe To Drugs - Falls Short of the Mark,"This film had real potential. It was almost like watching a video game from first to second person drug play. The problem is that director Noe got caught up in his panning scenes. There is so much traveling through walls and above buildings that the film is slowed down to a snails pace. It could have been reduced by about 40 minutes to help move the film along. Almost 40 minutes of slow sideways panning movement to represent the the out of body experience was far too much. By the time the (in your face) punchline was reached, it was no longer worth the wait. With a proper edit, this film could have been a winner. As it is, it is finished after one viewing and very unsatisfying. Good luck on staying awake through the thing. Perhaps viewers should sit upright and drink a lot of coffee."
3,Meh. Clearly for young trippers.....,I'll preface this by saying I've taken hallucinogenic drugs of various types when I was younger (Oh no!!! Alert the authorities!!!) so I'm going to review this movie as objectively as possible. I'll keep this short. This movie is a bit tedious to a sober person. It would have been much better as a short film. It's as long as it to help you ride out your trip on (insert drug here). I can clearly see how this could keep you amused while on LSD. At best it's a new take on old ideas with a lot of funky film making tricks and pretty colors thrown in (It takes place in Tokyo). Please see 'chainlink's review for a more in depth explanation of that statement (I don't have a lot of time today). It's not a terrible movie but if you're a grown-up you might want to try Teshigahara films instead.
1,DO NOT ENTER!!,"If you enjoy seizures then this movie is right for you. It starts out a little interesting but the plot and entire movie sequence doesn't make sense. I found myself wishing it was over and I had to constantly cover my eye's due the bright annoying light show that would occur about every 5 minutes. Maybe if you were really blasted stoned out of your mind you would enjoy this movie, which it seems to me like the creators were. Save your time and do not enter."
1,"bad movie, and cant play in other contrys than us.","ENTER THE VOID, DVD BY GASPER NOE.There is a codec on the disk so it dossent play well on dvd-players from europe, and other countries. I had to set my mac to US codec, and i can only do that 3 times more. You cant use this dvd unless you live in USA."
3,strange film,"Definitely worth watching once, this is a very unique film and will keep you entertained through out. The flashing lights get annoying fast, and you will likely need an Advil at the end if you watch it on a large enough screen. Not for the easily offended, definitely NC-17 material in several sceens."
1,Sorry...,This dude should stop using soooo many camera tricks and stick with a central character. A utter waste of time. Entirely too long.
2,Pretentious and boring,Pretentious and boring. The few potentially interesting ideas are submerged under prosaic drugs and sex and sophomoric stabs at profundity.
1,Disgusting,"If there is such a thing as a film with virtually no redeeming value, this just might be it.Cruel, exploitive, repetitive, annoying, shock for shock's sake.....everything is seen as through a veil of muted green, the same 'music' going ON and ON and ON....No real humanity here, the movie does not even allow for any empathy for the characters or their plight...it makes you feel like you are trapped in this half-life of drugs and sex, I can't think of anything bright or alive or even resembling human feelings....Some of the images just go WAY beyond the pale, no reason or sense to them....I wouldn't be surprised if the director has some serious issues with women......in a sick way......Anyone who makes a movie like this must have had some trauma or dysfunction in their childhood or lives to have come up with this pretentious dreck.....yuck!"
1,An excercise in futility,"As another reviewer so succintly stated the opening 2 minutes are a mesmorizing,rollercoster of visual and sonic brain candy. Sadly it's all downhill shortly after that. A relatively strange yet simple plot is led out over roughly 30 minutes. Thereafter the various permutations,digressions and repetition of the theme drag on for what seems like an eternity (2 hours)The pace of the film is excruciatingly slow and the ending is a merciless act that frees the poor viewer to try and collect his or her senses from the oppressive visual pounding that constitutes this film. Fans of Noe's other film's I stand alone and Irreversible will be very disappointed with his latest offering. Must to AVOID."
5,My opinion,"Beautiful, slow, frustrating, colorful, empty, visceral, sad, loving...are just some of the ways i can describe this film. Once again, Noe has made something interesting and full of everything. In this film, you are given the opportunity to die. To transcend into the void.This is one of the films that either has to be seen in a loud pitch-black theater, or trapped in your own dark room with a good pair of headphones. Each sound, each conversation-along with the street noises-has to be digested. It is the feel of the film...to be involved both in audio and visual. If you are unable to do this, you will not enjoy this film. It requires your full, undivided attention. Even if it lulls you to sleep. That's kind of the point. Ironically."
5,Noe is an amazing cinematic force,"Gaspar Noe scares me, intrigues me and inspires me in equal doses. He is an amazing cinematic force. He is someone I want to know."
3,"SPEED UP, MAN!!","What do you call a good movie that is MORE THAN AN HOUR TOO LONG?Certainly, not ""good"". I'd call it repetitious, slow, unnecesary, irritating, tedious...Ironically, the movie credits are probably the FASTEST in history...Not a terrible movie, but it could have been excelent if it wasn't more than 2 and a half hours long"
3,Visually arresting but too long and self-indulgent,"I'll keep it simple. Pros: fascinating cinematography, hot lead actress, plenty of sex and nudity, yummy Asian babes, innovative set design. The director had a vision and I give him credit for seeing it through. Cons: way too long, redundant, could have been shortened by 45 minutes, self-indulgent, monotonous, lead actor (Oscar) not convincing, hard to hear much of the dialogue, wanted to see more of delicious Paz's perfect body."
3,Henry Hopper recommended it.,"There was an interview with Henry Hopper, Dennis's son. He took some friends to the theater to see it. I bought it. It is far out and I am still trying to figure it all out. I guess you have to be smoking pot to really get into it."
2,"Poor Quality, too Expensive for what it is",It was missing some of the powder coat. I returned it and found a replacement on Amazon for $1.00 less that included the bumper!
2,Not that useful...,"Since Dirtblaster was pretty much a requirement for the electrical powerwashers I automatically got one for my gas driven one(Karcher G2500OH). So far I have had no use for it.With the dirtblaster nozzle you do get higher pressure, but I found it a little too uneven. If you are not careful you may ruin you concrete surface(as I did). To me a waste of money. The default nozzles for my powerwasher are good enough..."
5,Great Hand Cream,I love this hand cream. It really works. I shuffle a lot of paper at work and my hands ger really dry and chapped especially in the winter. This cream has been a life saver!
2,Disappointed,"Would love to be able to say this was great, however, one of the discs does not play. The other disc does work, and is fine. Very disappointed! I also gave another one of these types of sets as a gift, have not asked if it works. Don't think I would buy this type of product again. The idea is fun, but maybe not very practical."
5,This is a 6 Star Stocking Stuffer!! - Easy & Fun Reading,"They say a picture is worth a thousand words and this book only reinforces this phrase! The illustrations are great, making the book an easy and fun read.I think anyone involved in meetings, presentations, or interviews of any kind would benefit from this book. The book is a must have for anyone in the business world. Those just starting a career to seasoned professional can make use of the information. Coverage includes gestures, use of space, dress, facial expressions, body movements, etc.I plan on making use of the information monitoring my own body language, as well as interpreting the body language of others. What a great tool!!The price makes it a great Stocking Stuffer for new college grads or those looking to enhance their careers.ENJOY!"
2,great for office managers,"This is a quick read. about 62 pages not including the test at the end that is filled with cartoons and side notes repeating the text. It goes into good detail with office lay out and how the environment impacts the worker. It also covers how to communicate to the people under you in the office. If your are in sales (as I am) I would pass the book by. There is very little in this book that will help you with one - on - one interaction with a client. Again, this book is great for office managers with LITTLE time to read - I had the whole book read in just over an hour thanks to the large text and cartoons. IF you are looking for help in sales go elsewhere."
2,Too basic and too many illustrations,The book hs too many illustrations and the text covers very generic topics. I was able to obtain only 2 or 3 useful techniques from this book.
4,Amen to Pezel!!,This album provides a well needed dose of great 18th century chaconne. The other viewer was correct. Pezel's Sonata-Ciacona in B-flat major is like listening to God. The only peice missing that would make this album perfect is Bach's chaconne for solo violin.
5,Such beautiful playing. Really.,"I've rarely seen such divergent reviews. I am obviously on the side that finds these recordings an unmitigated joy. I don't mind a fair bit of rubato in my baroque, and she uses it here plenty, for sure. I'm not hearing the extraneous sounds or mistakes someone noted, and what I do hear of raspiness, and ambient noises (like breath) is fine by me. I think she avoids romantic melodrama just as the recording avoids washes of reverb, for example. Here there is intimacy, which clears the air for the notes to speak for themselves, and allows me to hear the Bach. As they say in the theater, ""Don't 'tell me.' 'Show me.'"""
4,"Great Product, but limited iPod application","Nice quality workmanship, the buttons work smoothly and as described. Unfortunately, the transmitter is very wide and covers the output jack on not only my iPod Touch, but also my iPod Nano 4th generation, which is what I purchased this for. Although the packaging and advertised uses say it's compatible with the iPod Nano, it is not compatible with the iPod Nano 4th Generation. I wish it was, this is a great remote and the pass-through feature on the transmitter for syncing and charging is a great extra."
4,Best remote for bikers and active sports,"LOVE this remote. Plugs right into the bottom of my 80gb Ipod Classic, remote gets strapped to my left wrist above my leathers. Buttons are easy to push in gloves. Can change the songs and turn it up/down easily while riding and maintaining throttle. Best to load up a good playlist.Pros- Easy to use, buttons easy to push, pretty reliableCost - $$$ (but worth it), sometimes you have to push the button twice but not often, and remote needs to be reset few times a year (hold all the buttons down for 60 seconds, easy).I recommend them to all bikers and anyone using their ipod for sports so you don't have to take the ipod out to change songs, play/pause or turn it up/down. Love it!"
1,Buyer beware,"I bought this remote because it was the cheapest one I could find. I got what I paid for. This remote remote only works when it wants too. It covers up the head phone jack on my iPod when it is plugged in, which is the only jack that you can use and control the volume. I wish I would have spent a little more and gotten a remote that worked better."
3,Worked as advertised but...,The iJet remote worked well but I had not realized that it would block the headphone jack on my iPod Touch (3rd gen). I had to return it as my primary purpose for buying it was to use it while riding my motorcycle. I ordered the iJet Nav which had the same functionality but did not block the headphone jack. Overall the iJet products are well made and function as advertised. A little better description would help to save on returns.
1,Astroturf warning - These 5-star reviews are from shills,"ASTROTURF WARNING: The 5-star reviews by ""Tim Stevenson,"" ""J. Lopez,"" and ""D. Wallar Don"" are shills for this product. Look at all of their identical ""see all my reviews"" lists -- they all reviews the exact same items which he is likely the manufacturer or seller.The idiotic exclamation points were a dead giveaway. (When will spammers ever learn that normal people don't act spammy?)"
5,Excellent primer for makeup,"I've used Murad Perfecting Serum for years and haven't found any product I like better or use more often. After you clean and moisturize your skin, lightly apply this serum that has a silicone-feel, almost a little oily feeling. The first time I used it I thought it would be too oily for my skin, but it absorbs immediately and leaves your face beautifully primed for flawless makeup application. Highly recommend this product and also recommend buying it on Amazon because the price is always better than in-salon.Murad Perfecting Serum, 3: Hydrate/Protect, 1 fl oz (30 ml)"
5,Great Stuff,Been using this product for at least 15 years and will never switch to anything else. Great product I highly recommend this.
2,Audio Mix less than spectacular,"Wish I could be more enthusiastic. Video a ""3"", audio a ""2"".5.1 mix with voice not coming from center speaker (as it should) but from overhead. Extra materials just okay."
4,For Annie Lennox Fans,"I am an Annie Lennox fan. I enjoy her powerful alto voice and respect her vocal range. I would listen to her sing anything. Because of that, this is a very enjoyable DVD for me. If I try to be objective, it may lack in video presentation and have some audio issues. It was recorded outside and the lighting and stage setting may not impress a lot of people. I also think it takes a while for her to hit the kind of intensity that would impress the less dedicated fan. If you are a hardcore fan, it's all good, but if you want a spectacular stage show and pristine audio and video, you may want to pass on this one."
3,Starts off slow then picks up steam,"It is probably a matter of taste. As the concert starts off with slow paced songs that all sound like variations on the same song. Yet I am used to a handful of the popular songs. So while I was waiting for something recognizable I noticed the audience was enthralled. If they were so may you be.About 40 minutes into the concert Annie finally picks up speed. At 57 minutes into it the concert is over and a documentary begins. A few of the Annie songs I am used to are sprinkled in the documentary. I guess I like planned choreography more than live.The DVD extras are worth it. The first is just a list of the songs in order so you can go to your favorite. The one marked ""jukebox allows you to build a personal play list or shuffle all. The setup allows you to display the lyrics."
4,passionate and pure...,"Obviously a must for Lennox fans. Most of the songs are from her ""Diva"" CD and very well performed. She warms up after the first few tunes and as her interview states she reacts to her audience's enthusiasm. She's a wonderful lyricist and composer. Video quality is acceptable but audio is above average. It's obvious they spent time rehearsing as the renditions are almost indistiguishable from the original recordings.I could have done without the ears on the musicians but like Rush's tumbling washers/dryers during their ""Vapor Trails"" tour I guess it's all part of the act."
3,Mediocre Picture quality..,"I am a great fan of Annie Lennox, so this was the only way I could enjoy her live on video. Her performance was excellent and the song list satisfies. The picture quality was pretty mediocre even though it was letterboxed. The sound quality fared better...above average."
4,Fantastic alternative xmas compilation!,"What a great CD if you like your xmas music fresh, new, and out of the ordinary. I recommend this album especially for two outstanding tracks in particular. Most importantly is the fantastic take of Vince Guiraldi's ""Christmastime is Here"" (yes, from the Charlie Brown cartoon), done by Ivy. Dominique Durand's voice sounds fabulous no matter what she sings, and she makes this song really shine. Also worth checking out is Death Cab for Cutie doing ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"", a must for any fan. The other songs all fit well within this compilation, strangely enough, Amazon doesn't list the songs on the product page. But, for a complete listing and streaming audio of the whole album, go to www.maybethisxmas.com. Enjoy!"
4,"Well-made, fashionable pieces","They're very well made and fashionable. The only thing I didn't like is that the bikini and wrap-around skirt could have been better-made. But still, top quality overall, and very cute pieces!"
4,good but not what I expected.,"first thing that you should know is that the vocals on this cd are no where near the realm of Rob Halford. actually the vocalist reminds me much more of Stephen Fredrick(ex-Firewind) actually the music reminds me much of Firewind. The album is packed with heavy riffs, good vocals and a strong production. this is a good album if you like the harder side of power metal, and I would recommend it to most any power metal fan. just don't expect to hear the next rob halford of tim owens."
4,good mystery with quirky characters,This is the second of Borton's books that I have read. This is apparently the first of the series. The characters are outrageous and the mystery is pretty good also.
2,Not your typical old fashioned mystery,"Very 90's heroine returns home after a split with her lover Liz to find she has inherited an old theatre. Her relationship raises no eyebrows with the eccentric family, all of whom have a theatrical past.Way too many characters to keep straight. I finally got tired of re-checking whom was whose child, sister.etc..Nothing really tense or suspenseful. Too much time is taken to point out the family's indiosyncrasies and not enough solid mystery."
4,SP999 Spectracide: Bag-a-Bug Disposable Trap Set,"TheBag-a-Bug Disposable Trap Setdoes not include what is in the picture. You receive a 'Trap' as you would if you purchased item code SP-901 and a 'Quick Stand' SP-904. There are two (2) bags in every ""Bag A Bug Trap"" SP-901 and there is one (1) lure. The photo of the set indicates a box of bags and a box of lures in addition to the Trap and Stand....NOT TRUE.As for the trap itself; it is great. Expect however, that you will collect beetles from your whole neighborhood, not just your yard. The beetles will be attracted before you can get the completed kit hung in place. I don't know what is in that lure but I sure wish fishing lures were that effective."
5,As Memory Serves,"It brings back memories...I read Will I Martin's column in the Gadsden Times as a child. Gadsden's Public Library has only 1 copy and it is for research only. Now I have a copy. It is clean, neat and just what I expected."
5,gel,I will be using this product a lot this summer when I make jams and jellies. Can never have enough of this product.
5,Clear jel,A good product at a very good price. This is not easy to find at grocery stores and was exactly what we wanted to make pie fillings.
2,not worth the money,"I works fine but unless you are a commercial producer the price is ridiculously high. It's at least 10 times more expensive than corn starch, which has been successfully used for likelt hundreds of years w/o a problem. I wouldn't buy it again"
2,Clear Gel Review,"I used to run a retail Bakery many years ago, and I used to buy Clear Gel buy 100 lbs size to use in making fruit fillings and custards. This product is over priced and isnt as good quality as other named prducts that I used to purchase years ago. Sorry, will not buy this brand product any more, as for what I need it for, I can get buy in using any brand Corn Starch."
5,clear jel,I use this to make pie filling for canning. It holds the filling together from the day I can it to the day i use a jar. great stuff
5,clear-jel 1Ib,This product works really well for making berry pies. It is better than flour or corn starch for poes.
4,Roguer's Sherman Tank review,This replica Sherman Tank is well designed and constructed to hold up either as a toy or display piece. It captures the true characteristic look of a World War II battle tank that served it's country well during the war as was well liked among the soldiers during that campaign.This model replica tank is one item that will forever be remembered in history as one tough tank that fought well in World War II.I would say this model is best suited for a display piece rather than a toy for the younger ages.
4,An excellent introduction to gladiatorial games,"Richard Watkins' book on the gladiators of Rome is a welcome addition to the sparse literature on these most fascinating 'sports figures' and the 'games' they engaged in. Targeted principally for the younger readers, it is still an enjoyable read for anyone interested in the professional swordsmen of the arena. The illustrations are quite good, although a more colourful and detailed medium than graphite might have better served to capture the parade-like splendour of the events. Gladiator is an worthwhile companion to Michael Grant's harder to find (and more detailed) Gladiators (also highly recommended)."
2,This is a nice book but it is for children and young people,"The book is basically a pictorial book for children and not for more experienced learners. As a beginners book it gives a fair description of the Gladiators history and place in the Roman culture but, it needs much more to compete with other books on the subject."
5,Unforgettable performance !,The peak of this CD is the colossal recording of the Royal Fireworks . Majesty with fierceness ; frehness and virility ; passion and intellect ; sublime and expressive ; lyricism and honesty are some of the adjectives which deserves this artistic triumph of Mr. Trevor Pinnock.
3,"Excellent execution; slow, stiff interpretation","The technical execution of the performance is excellent, but I find the interpretation too ""baroque"" in the bad way: a little too stiff, grand-as-in-slow. Marriner and Gardiner both produce performances that I find far more engaging emotionally: faster paced yet still sensitive."
2,Too hard to follow,"I just used this book in Paris and Rome and do not recommend it. Maybe it is already outdated, I don't know, but it was nearly impossible to follow through the museums. And then if and when I did find the thing he was talking about I didn't care for the flip comments about the artwork. (I know he's trying to be funny, but I would have appreciated some more basic information on things. I found myself trying to read museum cards just to find out how old some of the works were!) Also, it really gave no additional information over what was in the regular Rick Steves travel books but added just one more not particularly helpful book to the luggage."
5,DO NOT GO TO EUROPE WITHOUT THIS BOOK,"I just got back from a month in Europe and covered Venice, Florence, Rome, Paris, London, and Amsterdam. I used 90% of the book and could not have had a better trip. Rick Steves book made touring cities, museums, palaces, and churches an enjoyable and funny learning experience. You will never need a tour guide. And I am serious when I say, DO NOT GO TO EUROPE WITHOUT MONA WINKS!"
4,Perfect companion to get through museums!,"Took this along with me as I toured various museums in Italy and Spain and provided the perfect context to see paintings especially in the vatican museums (sistine chapel too) and at the Prado in Madrid. Would give it 5* but was totally lost in navigating the Prado but realized shortly thereafter that the Prado has since reorganized its collection after the book's publication date. Nevertheless the paintings were all grouped in the same area - just had to cross reference with the museum map. Unless you're an art history buff, this is the way to go when visiting museums. Even my husband, who regularly just looks and walks (quickly) and waits was following along with me. Highly recommend!"
5,great resource,This book is a great resource for anyone traveling to Europe who plans to visit any museums.
2,"cute title, second rate book","I travel for art and this book was a big disappointment. I expected practical tips and got only a few. What I also got, much to my surprise, was a dumbed down approach to art-now class, look at this part of the statue and think this. This is not insider information. It does help to check practical details-hours, days open, but I found that section mediocre in this book. And with the current economy, it is best to get up date information from the museum website. Many have cut their hours. I have toured most of these museums, and these guys miss some outstanding parts. I grant you that the Louvre is impossible-and if this book helps some people get in the door perhaps it has a function."
5,Very Useful,"From our background in travelling, we knew that museums could make or break a vacation (especially in Europe) so we bet on Mona Winks. It paid off big time. We saw many of the world's greatest museums (British Museum, Louvre, Vatican Museums, etc.) all in a simple uncomplicated tour. By reading different parts of it, you could see when and where to get a snack and how to avoid to crowds and the long lines. It saved our vacation, and when we go back we will use it again. The good thing is it is updated every year, and it covers the museums from the Prado in Madrid to the British Museum in London. This is a MUST for anyone who wants to know a little about art, travel to the great museums and survive, and overall have a great trip."
1,If you like a Vegas Production,"If you like a Vegas-style production, with a lot of ""smoke and mirrors"" but no musical substance, then this is the video for you. This spectacle is like a cross between a David Copperfield production and Cirque de Soleil. The only ""fire"" in these compositions is the fake one on the LCD screen behind the performers."
1,Milli Benise,"Aside from the poor pseudo-flamenco compositions.....The guitar is not live!!! Watch carefully and you will see - don't take my word for it.Other than that, beautiful dancing, gorgeous set design, and fantastic lighting!!"
3,Why the studio music,"I am watching this on HDTV right now, being the first time I ever heard of Benise. I was entranced by the music from the first note, but immediately noticed something just didn't look right: the music I was hearing was not the music I was seeing! My question is why? Was the audio recording botched? It looks like they did a wonderful show, but I was disappointed not being able to hear what I was actually seeing. Not only is it the guitar, but the violins, drums, everything! This show would get five stars from me if the audio was live. I'm sure the actual live performance is phenomenal. I wouldn't go so far as to call Benise a fake (he appears to really know the guitar), just something happened in production. I'm more disappointed with the producer/editor than anyone else. Let me hear the live performance, please!"
5,Benise: Nights of Fire,This DVD is one almost anyone with an appreciation of music will love. It made me smile and actively watch the dancers with Roni (he's soooo hot!) entertain the audience and the viewer. I felt as if I had a front row seat in my own home!
2,Comfortable enough...but not durable,"This saddle is comfortable, no question about that. But after less than a year of riding maybe 10 miles a week, the fabric is worn through. I re-covered it with duct tape...but at $30-40 a saddle should last much longer before reaching the duct-tape stage."
1,nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!,"suck,suck this game sucks save your money for the movie it cost less,this game has it all,bad graphics,terrible weapons amd terrible voice acting im tellin ya stay away from this as much humanly possible."
4,I am a huge Todd Parr fan!,His books encourage children to feel comfortable about themselves in every way - and they are funny and they are colorful. I look forward to reading them to my Granddaughter (age 3) who actually knows them by heart and has started to read them to me !!!
1,Do not buy this item!!!,I received this item very quickly but was very disappointed on how thick it was I cant believe when I felt how thick it was I actually put it in my hair that was a big mistake cause it took me about 4-5 washes to wash it out it was very disgusting needless to say after that I threw it away. I actually found a different brand of carrot oil at a beauty supply near me I wish I knew they had it before I purchase this one. Very nasty product so very gross!!
3,Virginia Kantra books,Am going back on this author's earlier books to read. Like the ones that she's written recently so wanted to read them too. An enjoyable read.
4,nice but could be sturdier,"I purchased 5 of these and wall mounted all of them, they hold up well and look nice , where they fit together though they could be tighter . Overall though I am pleased and will buy again"
4,It could have been sturdier but overall I like it,I purchased the Tower because I had a similar one. This one proved to be less sturdy (it bends and I wasn't expecting that)than my original tower but the functionality is pretty much the same and that's what was more important to me. I have lots of CDs so I'll be purchasing at least one more. Can't beat the price.
5,onyx 1248 80 cd,It was just what I was looking for. I use it on the wall but you can use it on the floor also.
2,It's okay,It was hard to put together. It initally leaned forward but latter learned piece was not properly attached. I felt it was unclear in how to assemble and wasted a lot of time doing so.
2,Disappointing,"The item looks nice and is of heavy construction - but, putting it together was a long, frustrating process for one person. It just did not line up well. The worst part though is that the base is not at all sturdy, one half just loosly sits on the other half and it has little stability; fine if you can anchor it to a wall, but not everyone is able to do that. Disappointing."
3,Leans a little,"After loading CDs into the tower, it appears to lean forward a little bit. The CDs haven't fallen out--yet--but I'm concerned about how long it will last before it leans forward some more and the CDs fall out."
1,Not what I expected,"I was not happy with this product. None of the information I read about this rack indicated that it came in 2 pieces, required some assmbly, and needed to be secured to the wall to be stable. When I assembled the rack and started to load it, the rack started to tip over and the CDs at the top fell out. The rack is very unstable. If you don't intend to screw the rack to the wall, don't buy it. You'll end up picking CDs up off the floor all the time. I paid $15 dollars to ship the rack to me and $12 to ship it back. I did receive a full refund ($30) from the company. Very disappointed in this purchase."
3,"It Works, But.....................","Easy to assemble and attractive, but if less than 3/4 full, has a tendency to tip - especially on carpet - when moved even a little bit."
1,shipping of tower,"The tower was fine they sent it in only a plastic bag and the ends had the paint chipped. Needless to say I sent it back,this happened twice!"
4,Aid to organizing CDs,I like how the tower allows me to keep my classical music CDs in one place. I learned I need to keep it on a hard surface to prevent tipping and spilling the CDs.
3,Not quite standalone,Make sure it is attached to a wall or put a weight on the feet or it will topple over.
1,Dangerously unstable,"The rack seems fine until you start to load your CDs, it begins to tip forward like the Leaning Tower of Pisa."
5,Great CD Stand!,"If you are the type of person that like tower CD stands that let's you read the side labels of your CDs, then this is the item for you! Easy to put together; it can either go on your wall or on the floor, or both for more stability. I would recommend this item!"
3,"not a stand alone, needs to be bolted to the wall","I like the clean straight lines of this product so I bought this one. I wanted to have a free standing tower but it is to light weight. The CD's slide around if you even touch one much less try to pick one out in the middle. SO......... I bolted it to the wall and all is well. I love it now. Clean lines and it works just fine. Just dont get this for a standing tower, you will be disappointed."
2,A most annoying Lady...,"After her Grandmother's death, Lady Lara Darling unwillingly sets off to London for the Season. While waiting on a coach, she meets Griff, an impoverished nobleman working as a driver. As in many a romance novel, she finds him ""the most beautiful man she had ever seen."" What follows are a series of incidents where Lara (a most infantile and annoying heroine) sets out to ""ruin"" her reputation; with Griff coming to her rescue time and time again(sigh).After reading Ryan's previous novella ""A Dozen Kisses"" included in ""The Further Observations of Lady Whistledown"" and enjoying it; ""The Duchess Diaries"" was a complete dissapointment. Hard as I tried, I just couldn't warm up to Lara, and while Griff was likable, I kept wishing he would find someone else.If you don't mind feeling like wringing the heroines neck every four pages, buy the book. It is not great, but it will help pass the time."
1,A real disappointment,"When I read the Lady Whistledown anthology, Mia Ryan's story was my favorite and I waited anxiously for The Duchess Diaries. What a disappointment. I eagerly began reading the book, but immediately disliked Lady Lara. What a goof!. I just couldn't warm up to her and her half-witted adventures. I started reading the book, then as it went on, I began skimming, and finally, I put it down. I think I could have liked Griff, but what did he see in her? He was an idiot for not looking for someone else. So, I haven't found many keepers lately, and this surely isn't one."
4,pam in carolina,the book was very funny and a real cute story. i could not put it down. lara and griff were a very amusing and dynamic couple. i can't wait to read about all the darling sisters.
2,Bentley Rhythm Ace - For Your Ears Only,"On their second album, For Your Ears Only, Bentley Rhythm Ace continue their streaking, fun big beat. The tracks here are quick and funky -- it's like the sonic equivalent of a 3 Musketeers bar: sweet and satisfying, but mostly filled with air. ""Theme from `Gutbuster'"" has a driving quality that just makes you want to boogie -- and this is true for almost all the tracks. ""Do the Christmas Rush"" sprinkles in some cheery synths to lighten the mood, but there's really nothing to distinguish the tracks from one another -- no catchy hooks or interesting samples. It's a pity, because their rhythmical abilities belie what this album could have been."
2,A tepid cycle,"I find this a tepid cycle that is neither very well sung nor dramatically involving. The recorded sound is also very ordinary. While Sawallisch is a good Wagnerian, the orchestral playing here cannot be compared with that of Levine's or Karajan's orchestra. The interpretation cannot be said to be inspirational. However, what makes this set not competitive is the many flaws in the casting. Of the many singers, only Varady and Moll give fine performances. Kollo's Siegfried is long past his prime and Behrens's wobbly and effortful Brunnhilde is one of the big liabilities of the set. Schunk's Siegmund is disappointing and Hale's Wotan is far too light-weight. The other cast members are competent but not very special. It's better to look elsewhere for a complete recording of the cycle."
3,Book Review,"This book is written in a style that makes it hard to read, even for a textbook. It contains lots of important information and several great chapters, but it case you are careful you'll fall asleep every 15 mintues."
3,"Please, Nana, do something new.","When Amazon notified me that a new Nana Mouskouri cd was being released I was all set to order it immediately. But then I looked at the song list and saw that I already have eight of the cuts on the new cd on old ones. There are so many songs I'd love to hear Nana do and hoped this cd would have some, I'm disappointed. That said, if you don't have any of her cds then you might get this one, she's terrific."
5,Simply delightful!,"I am in love with the music of Nana Mouskouri, no matter in what language she sings. The songs on this album demonstrate her versatility and are all very enjoyable. Nana will grow on you if you are not all too familiar with her music. One of the songs ""Oh Happy Day"" mesmerized me and I had to play that cut repeatedly. This is a very generous collection and an excellent introduction to Nana's vast music catalog."
3,A good CD to have,My rating is because there were several songs that were new to me and I could have done without them. The rest were great.
5,"Great voice, great songs","This is one of those CD's that people comment on.... it is an ""everyone will like it"" for the car rides."
5,Beautiful Voice,I bought this CD for my father who is a fan of Nana Mouskouri. The CD is being enjoyed by all. Nana's voice is truly amazing....She transitions well from one language to another and sings so effortlessly.
1,3D Safari Africa [Blu-ray],"The 3D Safari Africa video content is shaking through out, it is extreamly irritating i did not even enjoyed it.is it possible to give me another copy of 3D Safari Africa that is not ""shaking""."
5,Awesome 3D SAFARI Footage!! Great quality -- the whole Family will love it!,"Recently saw a preview of this movie when a friend who works for one of the companies associated with the film did a demo for some folks. I have to say it looks AWESOME! All the footage was SHOT IN 3D in Africa. I am told this makes all the difference -- movies actually shot in 3D vs. converted to 3D. The quality of this piece is truly top shelf! You can't go wrong buying this for yourself or as a gift for someone. Some breathtaking footage of animals & scenery in 3D! Hunter Ellis also does a great job as host: taking the audience on a comprehensive Safari from the comfort of their living room. :) If you want to see a sample be sure to ask them to put the movie on one of the big screens at your local Best Buy or other similar store. I think you'll agree it's a really fun, well made 3D experience for the whole family. Enjoy!"
1,Hunter at his Self-Serving Best,"I was very eager to purchase this blu-ray, anticipating a 3D safari. One where the animals popped out of the screen, and lots of them. Of course, this is supposed to be a Safari!What I saw was Hunter interacting in staged, blatantly ridiculous interactions with the native folk (many who realize its ridiculous and roll their eyes) while sharing a Coke amongst poverty-stricken individuals who couldn't even afford one. Ok, so where's the Safari??? 20 minutes wasted.When we finally do see animals, it's all about Hunter Ellis, not the numerous species. His 'Wows' as some of them almost nail him. Boring... What's missing is the exciting 3D pop as we almost feel as though we've interacted with the animals...like a Safari!Not to be found here."
3,for the price not a bad buy,"The story line seemed a bit corny.. but if you hang in there for the 3d effects and good pics of these wild animals, in there natural habitat. you'll be glad you did. for the money this is a good 3d movie."
4,To many previews,"The blue ray took longer than I expected to receive but I wasn't in a hurry so it was ok. The movie was in perfect condition when I received it, the packaging was fine and I had no problems with the seller. The movie has way to many previews!! Half the content on the blue ray was previews. It was frustrating fast forwarding through half the content with my grandson sitting waiting for the safari adventure to begin. Once you finally get to the main attraction it's good. Just be aware that the previews go on forever."
1,3d? where,had potential for atleast an interesting look at wildlife but is far less exiting than even marlin perkins and the 3d effects are practically non-existent
3,Not that great,We bought this because it had good reviews. It was not a very good quality 3D movie. Content was fair but got boring as the movie went on.
2,very cheap cover,"I have about 10 3d dvds all are with nice 3d cover and they look great,this dvd is got so much cheap cover , doesn't even look like 3d, talking about pictures quality is not everything in 3d, very not to keep you watching , I stop watching after 5 min. not interesting at all, on discovery chanel I watch much better shows"
4,BEST 3D BLU-RAY I HAVE SEEN,"I have purchased and viewed several 3D movies on my Sharp 3D TV. This one by far is the best. Crisp, Clear 3D. I would recommend this disc to anyone interested in Wildlife.My daughter enjoyed it thoroughly, as well."
3,Fun in 3-D!,We have visited wonderful safaris in So. Africa so this was fun to see in 3-D and be reminded again.
4,Good documentary,"A 60 minute journey around parts of Africa, it is interesting wildlife doing their things. The disc itself during the initial start gives a choice of 2-D or 3-D. It took a couple of tries to convince my player to give the 3-D effect. There is very little coming-at-you effect (you really didn't want these critters coming at you during the filming) otherwise there is very good 3D effect."
4,very good,"This video at times lets you feel as if you are standing on the Savannah in Africa. Got kids? Get it. Blu ray 3d, like this, well done, especially with good passive hardware is amazing. Our Vizio m3d650sv TV does an excellent job. Like I said, if you have family under 16 for sure get it, but truly everyone will like this one. 3d brings it to life."
4,HAPPY,"EL SERVICIO FUE PUNTUAL, EL PRODUCTO LLEGO A TIEMPO Y EN PERFECTO ESTADO MUY COMPLACIDO! SEGUIRE COMPRANDOLE PRODUCTOS A ESTE VENDEDOR!"
2,Very Fragile - Falls apart,My 11 year old sone wanted one of these so bad. It was fun for the first few minutes . Until hit the ground and started to disenegrate. It just didn't last for more than few minutes. I know it has to be lightweight to hover and fly - but I wish it could be made of a more sturdy medium rather than styrofoam.
4,comprehensive and scholarly,I found this book to be of great interest although it was a bit more scholarly than I expected. Given how little is known about that part of the world and the Oceanic peoples I found it to be full of interesting information.
2,mistakes mistakes,"there are two ups in this book, one is it has the xp information, which I can't find in other books, the other is the 20% discount in prometric exam.there are tons of mistakes in this book, I hope these mistakes are made during printing, otherwise I don't know how these people got their certificate. for example, a picture of ring network is where a star network shoudl be.also, authors made very little distinction between XP home version and XP perfessional, for example, I try to find the backup utility in my home version, only to find out, ASR only works on XP professional."
4,A+,"I gave it 4 stars not for its content, but for its condesed information. I tried to read other books and they would just put me to sleep. This book goes straight to the point and it was perfect for me and my experiece. I passed the test with this book and yes it didn't cover half of the questions that were on the test, but I passed and that's all that matters. I spent 5 days studying the hardware section and 4 days studying the OS section. I thought the OS part was the most difficult so pay a lot of attention to that section."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!,"If it wasn't for the fact that I have nearly ten years experience dealing with computers, I probably would have failed the A+ exam. The editing was terrible, with many illustrations not matching there description, especially in chapter 10, where none of the illustrations even match the section they are in. In addition, the book did not cover about 20% of the hardware exam. Furthermore, the practice CDs don't work without email support from Microsoft, which is slow to say the least. If you have some experience and are using this book to supplement some form of training, then it's not so bad...if you can find it for free."
2,Better off with A+ for Dummies book.,"Faster Smarter would be OK if it supplemented other A+ study books, but don't let be the only guide to passing the certification test. A few problems with this book are:-sections that end in useless bullet points. Most that don't seem to have meaning toward the test.-Chapter tests that post the answers directely below the question (who can learn that way?).-Too many errors. Errors, although not concentrated in any one subject, are in the chapter review answers, illustrations, and text.If one would have to choose just one book to purchase and pass the test, you would be better off with something else such as A+ for Dummies."
3,Works only when you want to update your knowledge.,"I have just pass the core hardware exam by only reviewing this book for 2 days. However, I have read the whole ""A+ training guide (2001)"" about 2 years ago. All I need is some new stuff that came out in the past 2 years. There are quite a few mistakes in this book.The good part of this book is that it includes sample exams which helped me recognizing my weak points.My suggestion is ""Don't use this book as your only source for preparing the exam."" If you only want a book with new information, this might be the book to choose from since it is much cheaper than other big books. If you have a bit more money, buy the newer version ""A+ training guide"". I like that book a lot."
4,Good enough to pass,"Well the book is pretty thorough on the topics it covers. The test however does touch up on a few things not mentioned in the book.I gave it 4 stars because the material it presented was thorough and complete, but the test just covered a few more things. I also believe that a book cannot cover every single thing on the test. I passed the tests, but I would recommend another source of study along with this book .. ie: online practice tests, hands on experience, and another book."
3,OK,"Very spacious and light on my back. Overall, a great bag with lots of space and handy pockets. The only problem I have had with it is that the zipper broke the first week I had it. I can still use the bag fine because the other side isn't broken, but I was disappointed the zipper was so cheap."
5,Fantastic Book!,I would order this for any gifts!Again and again!It is an inspiring book with wonderful illustrations and I would highly recommend it!Ben Franklin was awesome!
5,Great book for kids,This does a very good job explaining Dr. Franklin's contributions to science and invention. Made my boy happy to read and learn about him.
5,Great Quality Literature!,I am a college student studying to be a teacher. I used this book to create a social studies unit. All of my classmate looked at the book loved the pictures and quality information. There is so much to learn about Benjamin Franklin from this book and it is presented in a very fun way. Since Benjamin Franklin did not patent any of his inventions the book explains what he created and how it has transformed into something we use modern day. Love this book!
2,Disappointed,For the price that I paid for the book I was expecting much more. The book had good information but few pages. It would be better if it were printed as a soft cover book and the price reduced considerably!
4,the philosophy & opinions of Marcus Garvey,The book is highly educative and motivational.I compare it to the book think and grow rich a black choice by Dennis Kimbro. I recommend it to all blacks and those seekers of garveysm.
3,Not better then his others,This is a great introductory for New Cormega fans. But it's no where near as good as The Realness and The True Meaning. And almost the entire album is filled with songs most Cormega fans have already. This album was shelved back in the mid 90's. But tracks where then leaked and made it to mixtapes and the internet. So if you've been following Mega then your not going to enjoy this album much. If your a new fan then buy it.
2,Waste of Money,This Audio CD is barely adequate. These people are DEFINITELY NOT the Grammy-winning Swingle Singers of the 1960's!!! What a disappointment! BRING BACK THE ORIGINALS!
2,Flats and Sharps,"I enjoy the Swingle Singers very much but sadly, in this album they are flat on about half of the tracks. When they are on key, they are very, very good. When they are flat they are awful. Recommendation: buy a different Swingle Singers CD."
4,A Swingle Singers Half Treasure -,"If you love Bach and are a fan of the Swingle Singers, buy this CD. Fans of the Swingle Singers enjoy them for what they do to music - release it with air and bounce - and their style is perfectly suited for Bach. I couldn't enjoy it more. But the second Cd in this set is their treatment of Mozart, and, for me, it's inconsistent. This is due to the different styles of the two composers and I just think they match up better with Bach. But at this price, I shouldn't be complaining. The first CD alone is worth twice as much. Snatch it up!"
5,Cute one to add to your bookshelf,"This is the darling story of The Little Mermaid in a shortened, Golden Book version. It's the perfect length for a bedtime story for my 4 year-old. I bought lots of them and gave them as party favors for my daughter's Little Mermaid party. They were hit because it's a favor the kids actually keep instead of a bunch of trinkets. Enjoy!"
4,The Little Mermaid by Michael Teitelbaum,-A wonderful story!!! I still go through the feelings and emotions that happen throughout the book. I think it's a great under water sea story and I recommend it to any little girl!
3,I think it is too fast paced for kids,"I have read this book to my kids a number of times, and they like it. I don't think they understand it, though, from some of the questions they ask. I think the book is fun to read, with lots of good lines to read and good illustrations to match. But I think there is just too much going on in it, and I don't like how there are so many quick transitions from one scene/setting to another."
2,"Great Value, Too Harsh","These puffs are very harsh and extremely abrasive. They left scratches on my face after using them. They also do not last as long as a Buf Puf. I now use them to scrub my feet (they are good for that). When it comes to your face, spend the money for the Buf Puf."
1,"The should have been titled ""Judge Dredd-ful""","This was far and away the absolute worst move Sylvester Stallone or anyone ever made. Maybe if you're eight years old and were brought up on a steady stream of comic books this movie might appeal to you, but otherwise-BEWARE. I saw it roughly 12 years ago and still can't believe that it ever made it past the first week at the cinema. Stallone must have done it only for the money, as it sure didn't do anything to advance his career. The laughable line, ""I AM THE LAW"" was too pathetic, as were most of the other lines in this movie. Again, BEWARE."
1,"Not my movie, apparently","I had great difficulty even finishing this movie. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had been familiar with the comic series it was adapted from, but I found it lacking in almost anything a movie CAN lack. The acting felt stiff in most cases, the plot was simplistic, and nothing really caught my attention. It had an interesting enough premise that I'm pretty disappointed that I found the movie to be this terrible."
1,Seriously... Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Everything about this movie was terrible. I am one who was familiar with the Dredd comics and could therefore appreciate the setting/costume/design/etc.That all said... there is no justification for this film. Everything was terrible. Stallone - terrible. Schneider - terrible. Special effects - terrible. Plot twists - terrible (that moronic band of cannibals? Jesus.). That stupid robot - terrible.In all honesty, this could be the worst movie I have ever seen. And I really dig sci-fi."
1,This has to be the worst movie in modern cinema history,This film needed a different actor to star because Stallone accent is difficult to understand. Even with the right actor it only gets a star. The plot is silly. It is not in keeping with the comic book in many aspects. There are numerous plotholes .
3,Not as bad as it seems,"Based on the DC Comic; this film adaptation of Judge Dredd doesn't fully display the heart of the comic it is adapted from, but on it's own it's mindless fun with none other than Sylvester Stallone in the title role. Stallone is as stoic as ever for the first half of the film, and seems to have a lot of fun in his role, while Armand Assante chews the scenery as Dredd's nemesis Rico, while a pre-Unfaithful Diane Lane puts on a good show as well. It's completely mindless; but thanks to some nicely assembled action scenes, impressive special effects, and a great tightly knit cast (including Rob Schneider, Max Von Sydow, Jurgen Prochnow, Joan Chen, and Balthazar Getty), Judge Dredd is better than it is reputed to be; and with the recent wave of comic licensed films to hit theaters, I find it better than The Hulk."
4,Comics To Movies.,"This is just a movie adapted from a comic book. Fans of Judge Dredd or comic books can enjoy this action flick or not. There are worst comic book movies out their and Judge Dredd is not one of them, so remember this is just a fun ADAPTION, sit back and enjoy the action or shut up until you can do a better movie, if you can even make a movie since you critics make it sound so easy! Hey ""True"" the movie could have been better, but so can every other comic movie, with more money, better actors, technology, and so on. For us fans it's all we have till somthing better comes."
4,Review,"Arrived in less than a week. Bought this as a gift for a friend. Movie is ok, but the laughs this gift will bring is priceless"
3,"Good than, Passable now",Followed comic book too closely in regards to looks. But cool considering the limited cgi they had at the time. Good for watching to bring back you're memories of movies from your youth.
4,Eat recycled food,"Judge Dredd DVDJudge Dredd stars Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante in a futuristic movie about a lawman who presides over an overpopulated and violent metropolis .The Judges are the Judges Jury and executioners all-in-one. ""Eat recycled food. It is good for you"" is a common theme. It is good for the environment""Recommended for fans of Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante.Gunner, May, 2008"
4,Liked it very much,"I thought it was typical stallone, as one who never really read the comic strip but did play the role playing game (a lot), I thought that the feel of the world was fairly well captured. The movie was not as dark as the role playing game or the little I've seen of the comic strip. This is obviously far in the past of the world that the roleplaying game takes place in as the judges are still human and not yet genetically manipulated and the weapons and other goodies were not quite as advanced. I liked the movie very much and I only wish they had made more than one movie."
4,Great Stallone movie!!!,"This was somewhat hated by critics, but I loved Judge Dreddwith Sylvestor Stallone and Diane Lane. It had great stunts,effects and action.Based on the comic book, Dredd is framed for murder, unawareit's the work of his serial killer enemy. He then embarkswith help from one of his friends to break out of prisonand certain death from Cannibals to clear his name.Great movie, a big thumbs up go to the real and fun visionof the director. Stallone as only he can do looks great.Also check out the comic book and the Judge Dredd video games."
4,Way too much hate on this movie!,"I like this movie one of Stallone's better 90's action films and yes it's based on Judge Dredd. It seemed fans of the comics had a problem with Stallone removing his mask, in my eyes, the live action version maybe it's time to remove his helmet people. Plus you can see Stallone tried paying homage to Judge Dredd with his performance which I actually thought was very good.Good action, nice set design, fun to look at, Diane Lane is hot, I didn't mind Rob Schiender all that much, and a good attempt in my eyes to make Judge Dredd come alive. The movie gets way too much negativity it's fun to watch.They are remaking Judge Dredd in 2012 - get ready for a hard R helmet not removed Karl Urban as Judge Dredd. Should be worth a look as well.""I am the Law!"""
3,"Not bad; in fact, I like it...","Sylvester Stallone really knows how to be campy. All throughout ""Judge Dredd,"" he never seems to take the part seriously and it's all for the better. The film wouldn't work if Stallone had tried to be convincing. Instead, he stands macho and strong, overacting and chewing scenery while still keeping his dignity. Way to go, Stallone! The plot takes place in the future, where Judges are now city police and crime, of course, does not pay. The best of the judges, Dredd, has just been framed for murder and now a former judge threatens to take over the world unless Dredd can stop him. It's a very basic premise, stealing from the likes of ""Robocop"" and others, but it works surprisingly well. The special effects are mostly pretty good if not dated by today's standards. Overall, the film packs in punch and fun and delivers a solid 90 minutes."
4,Action Packed Excitement!!!,Get ready for this great action packed thriller that stars Sylvester Stallone as a ruthless judge that acts just like a robocop. He gets framed for murder and it becomes an all out brawl to get himself justice. Ladies and Gentlemen get your popcorn ready safety belts this is going to blow you away.
1,"Horrible, not worth your time!!!!","The worst Stallone flick ever!!!!!!!! Do not buy this....In fact I am amazed they still offer this movie for sale...It was nicknamed ""Judge Dud""!"
4,Cool DVD and great Sci-Fi Movie,Who says this is a ripoff? Everything is basically a ripoff of everything. This is a great Sci-Fi thriller with a ton of cool effects and great storyline. Must see!
1,If I could give this 0 stars I would,"Judge Dredd is a symbol of justice, a man who is judge, jury and executioner. He gives the creeps a warning then beats them up a lot, arrests them or just blows them away.He does not stand aroudn striking a poncy pose or takes his hat off after 5 minutes. He clobbers people with a night stick.This film is a wasted license and possibly the worst big budget action film for many years (not counting any Steven Seagal films). If Judge Dredd did exist he would arrest the entire production crew, especially the writers.A waste."
4,Why does this movie get bashed?,"This movie is not as bad as some would have you believe. What movie couldn't be a little better? Armand Assante's portrail of Rico alone makes this worth the money. My only question is; What happened to the ending? One second there's some fighting and a few gunshots, then suddenly the whole place is blowing up. There is definately some missing footage here. Where's the DVD director's cut? My money will wait until then."
2,Could have been ...,"The producers of Judge Dredd might have actually had a franchise on their hands had they just toned down the violence. Cutting the rating from its current R down to maybe a PG or PG-13 would have opened the movie up to a much wider, younger, audience who may have been a little more forgiving of its ""cartoony"" style and predictable plot. Although it isn't the most intelligent movie I've ever seen, it definitely has its entertaining moments. That said, I still don't think I'd spring twenty dollars to buy it, I think I'd be able to shell out a few bucks to rent it with a clear conscience. All in all, not too bad a movie. It's just a shame, I really think it could have been a money maker had it been edited a little different."
3,"Stallone, hamming it up","I like dumb obvious action movies, but this one is just too much. Usually, I can be VERY forgiving when it comes to acting and plot, but Stallone really just took this to a whole other level. While it is an entertaining film, I can't really justify buying it. I really just watched this movie because I watched Dredd 3D, and I wanted to see how this film held-up in comparison to this one. Dredd 3D is much better. And, as I understand it, quite a bit more faithful to the comic than this one."
4,"Excellent quality picture and sound, still fairly stupid","Judge Dredd has finally made it to Blu-Ray, and it was worth the wait. The picture is crystalline. The sound is excellent. You still have to disengage your brain to deal with all the plot holes in this thing, but if you're a fan of movies with end-to-end gratuitous violence, Judge Dredd will more than fill the bill."
4,Prepare to Be Judged!,"Let me say that this movie is very underrated and deserves more positive attention. You get a very good and entertaining movie that has good special effects, action scenes, plot, and awsome sound. Stallone of course is Judge Dredd and man can he get things done because he respects the law and operates by it. He feels that the law does not make mistakes, until he is convicted for a murder he did not commit. He gets teamed up with Rob Schnieder, who he judged strictly to find out why he was framed for the murder. Rob Schnieder adds a comedic part to the movie, so the movie is not all action. I was very pleased with this blu-ray and give an awsome B+."
5,a great 1,Silvester Stallone plays a cop/judge/the law in the near future. The weapon is real cool it can shoot out a bunch of different types of ammo by voice activated. At the end of the movie he then goes against his greatest enemy his brother. i love this lots.
3,"""I am the law!""","I think this film is pretty similar to Demoltion Man. I think it's poorer than Demolition Man. Yes, i enjoyed some of the action scenes. Sylvester Stallone does that funny thing with his mouth when he says I am the law!.Picture quality: 4/5I remember the quality was good and nothing wrong with it. Good sharpness and details.Audio quality: 4/5I did find it good and no flaws.Film: 3.5/5Overall: 3/5"
4,Dredd,This is a classic Stallone movie. Why do I need to rate it. It is one of a collection of sci-fi/futuristic movies that over the years have been moved in the sci-fi hall of fame.
2,GO... Sly!,"The world and originally very cynical atmosphere in the comic is not very well adapted to this movie. To be honest the whole film entirelly crap from the beginning all the way to the ending titles, but don`t you just love the robot -design by Chris Halls(or Cunningham). Considering that it was made 10 years ago it`s in every way far more exiting to watch than forexample any of those animated crappy bluescreenmuppets in the new episodes(1-3) of star wars."
1,"I AM THE LAW!! (but honestly, why?)","All I can say is this is a very bad movie. It has no plot, no action no humor. However, it has great acting. Just kidding, the acting blows. Stalone really should have re-thought this one. But hey, we all make mistakes. Fortunately, most of our mistakes aren't as bad as Judge Dredd. Don't even waste $.49 on this movie. Honestly, don't even tune into it when it's on cable. And if you do watch it, tie your hands behind your back because you might have the sudden urge to injure yourself for subjecting yourself to the torture of watching a movie that's this bad. I'm serious, it's a waste of your TV. O by the way, my 1 star rating was quite generous."
5,Best of the best. Spectecular sound.,"It is not in a DTS, but if you like spectacular sound Judge Dred is one of the best so far. I own almost thirty DVD titles, but this is the one I love to show to everyone who come to visit me. I rate ten stars for this title. I don't care about the story line. What do you out of your DVD? Isn't it sound or picture quality? Two thumbs up for Sylvester Stallone. Why haven't him made any more movies?"
2,Dreddful Review,"One of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again...Maybe I'm hoping the movie will get better with time. Unfortunately ""Judge Dredd"" does not! I'm a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre CGI , an action hero star, a comic relief, and a beautiful love interest but please don't mess with the storyline. Maybe thiis is the case for ""Future Shock"" and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person's humanity and ""Dredd"" forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary....In fact , I feel two stars is gviing this movie too much!"
3,Munce,"As a film in it's own right, this is decent enough - it's a step up from 'Johnny Mneumonic', and has some decent effects, a neat translation of one of 2000AD's 'ABC Warriors' (from a separate strip), and all-in-all it's decent mindless fun.As a translation of the Judge Dredd strip, though, it starts off interestingly and then turns unforgivably bad - whilst the paper Dredd is, essentially, a soul-less monster (he was initially modelled on Clint Eastwood's 'Dirty Harry', but taken to an insane extreme), Stallone plays him as a slightly peeved version of a standard action hero. It's closer in tone to the US comic version of Dredd, and misses the ultra-dark humour and much of the bleak setting of the comic. Much of the blame has been left at the feet of Stallone's populist instincts - if it was to be Hollywood-ised at all, this really needed the dry wit of Arnold Schwarzenegger.There's an interesting soundtrack featuring a diverse range of unexpected bands, including, oddly enough, the Cure."
2,Good...until the plot kicks in.,"The first part (a.k.a. the first 15 minutes) are pretty cool, with Sly as some sort of human version of Robocop. But then the plot kicks in and he loses the flashy armor and weapons and such and it turns quickly into a Total Recall rip-off...except he's got a dopey side-kick. Art direction is nice, but they could do better than the bargain-basement CGI they popped for. Sly and Judge Dredd deserve better than this."
3,old sci fi,"I remember how exciting this was a decade bak, but now seems cartoonish. The shock value of the past is now gone."
4,judge dredd,this is an assume movie. everyone should watch it and get it. the action the excitement the funny parts its all very cool.
4,A movie for when I'm in a silly mood,I watched Judge Dredd in the theator many years ago & really enjoyed the mixture of serious sci-fy with comedy. This is a movie I like watching when I'm in a silly mood - it's a good pick me up.
3,Whatever can be said about this movie has already been said,"The quality of the bluray movie itself is great. It even comes with a featurette of the making of the movie. Little extra hit of nostalgia. The movie itself, well, if you bought this movie, you know what your getting."
1,"Not a certified seller. Product is NOT the same. ""Real"" product is fantastic!","I recently purchased this item and when I received it, the coloring was off, the bottle was smaller than 6 FL OZ, there was NO Murad seal of certification, it didn't come in the box and the ingredients were listed in a different order. The label stated 6 FL OZ/ 180 mL, when the ""real"" product is 6 FL OZ/ 150 mL, which makes sense. Beware if you choose to purchase this product, do so from a different seller. This seller is not very helpful when it comes to returns and they provide you with no tracking information when this item is shipped. I spoke with a customer service at Murad and they informed me that the product I purchased, was in fact fake!Aside from the bad review of the seller, I love this product. I have very sensitive skin and have been using this product for years! Its refreshing and never once has it irritated my skin or dried it out like other toners."
5,A Must For Every Serious or Professional Electrician,W A R N I N G: This book is not for the weekend repairman!!!This is a very intense book for the professionals or for someone who would like to further their knowledge. This truely might be the last book an electrican will ever buy. A must for your library!
4,"A Gem, with caveats","This is an excellent, if dense read that bridges the gap between the science of electricity, and the practical matter of an Electrician's work. It will not fully explain the science of the topic, and it will certainly not teach you how to wire a house. It is a very good book if your question runs along the lines of ""Why does it work that way?"" Its treatment of Ohm's law and other fundamentals is particularly useful. That said, the index is a nightmare, the book is not organized by page number, and it contains some apocrypha.I have been an electrician for just over two years now (and I wrote this using my wife's login, because I'm too lazy to relog)"
2,Good Addition for reference,"The American Electricians Handbook, aka. Electricians Bible is a good reference book to own however the NEC Handbook for me is used more. The American Electricians handbook does cover good topics. Examples would be UPS Systems and commonly used raceways, enclosures, boxes & devices.If an electrician had questions pertaining to a particular subject it is really good. For everyday referencing it's not."
4,Not regular TPB size,"My fault for not looking at the product description's dimensions more closely, but I thought I was getting a regular-sized trade paperback. This is smaller than other graphic novel trades, and aesthetically it doesn't fit in with my first two Bone TPBs. Unfortunately, this version is also colored - this honestly disappointed me because I adore Jeff Smith's inks, and his beautiful B&W; balance.I promise my complaints end there! Smith's work is lovely, and the story is fun and bizarre with lots of heart."
1,Don't let your child read this series!!!!!,"I was completely shocked and horrified that this book is marketed to young children by Scholastic. My eight year old son received Bone as a gift. I could not believe that the content contains characters smoking. This is NOT a book that should be given to a child for that reason alone! After doing some research I read that Scholastic at first did not want to include the inappropriate content. They decided to leave it in the book when the author refused to edit it. As a parent I do not think any child should be reading a book that ""glamorizes"" smoking. I am also disgusted that Scholastic, which is a name parents trust, would allow this series to be marketed to young children."
3,Mixed Collection,"Like many of Barry McGee's previous publications his latest book is a mish-mash of sorts and incorporates a mixture of photographs and artworks. In one sense it makes sense since McGee's street art is considered essential to his work. But there are also snapshots mixed in and it feels a little disjointed. I like the reproductions of his traditional 2D artworks (canvases, works on paper) and wish there were more of it in the book. Hopefully some day someone will publish a book just on his gallery work. The book is ok, not great. If you're a McGee fan you'll know what to expect. For those new to his art try and look through it first before deciding to purchase."
1,Be careful...they charge too high for shipping,Ohhh these people charge too high for shipping and handling.....I ordered two tabs and they charged me 14 dollars for shipping and handling....too much.....too bad...they are making money on God's name......
2,Written for Philosophy Professors,"This book is fine if you are a philosopher and interested in the concept of emergence. But if you are looking for a readable book, this is not for you. Phillip Clayton can write in an understandable way, but in this book he uses a very hard to understand style.The book indicates that the concept of emergence is not well defined and the reader is likely to feel as confused after reading it as they did before. I would only recommend this book for an academic with a background in philosophy who is pursuing emergence as a concept. For the rest of us, it can be used as a sleep aid."
3,Misleading,"The picture is very misleading. It looks like a tie that is one width the entire length, which is what I thought I was ordering. I was hoping for a ""mad men"" style tie. However, that is NOT the case-- the tie is larger at the end than at the top. The quality is fine, i guess- nothing special, but not bad. Just be forewarned that this is not a vintage style tie though."
5,Great Bargain,"When double CDs first came out, it was two CDs for the same price as a single full-priced CD. This is two CDs for the same price as single mid-priced CD, making each CD cost less than 6 dollars, a very good deal. However, good deals are only good when the product is great. And these performances are simply magical. The sound is excellent. What more could you ask for?"
1,Read CFR rather than read this book,This book was nothing more than copying Code of Federal Regulation.It was time and money waste.I don't understand why and how this kind of book can be published.
5,"Beethoven, justified","A wonderful CD of some of Beethoven's most popular chamber music. The quality is superb, the tone flawless, and the sheer expression is no less than inspiring. Definitely worth every penny."
4,Nice fit. Good Quality after 5 years,Purchased 2005 with corrective lenses from Leisure Pro.I am an occasional diver. Five years later the silicon is as new. Not deterioration on strap but then I take care by rinsing and store the mask properly after each use.Comfortable fit on every dive.
4,The warm-ups are longer than the form.,"I like the DVD better than the VHS tape with which I started. Chapters are a favorite feature of mine. With chapters features, I can do the warm-ups first before I practice the form. Since this form may be done right or left side, the viewer may use this as her mirror image when first learning the form."
2,Way too tight on the calves,While these socks were cosy they were completely unusable for skiing as I could not pull them up under my boots without cutting off my circulation! I am a size 14 - with average legs - I think - and these were impossible - had to wear them folded down.
1,RIP OFF!,"It is entirely my fault that I didn't cross compare sizes and prices before I bought this item, but I did not realize that I was paying $8.95 for 16 ounces of corn starch.... REALLY?! The same cornstarch that I found for $1.43 from another company on Amazon! Shame on me for not noticing... but THIS IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF!"
3,One kind of puzzle over and over,The puzzles are good but the book offers just one kind with different permutations. You tape a math problem to an answer to build a square. You need to understand that before you buy it. My students liked it. Creating new puzzles absorbed the time and energy of my more advanced students.
2,You can have mine,"Had this a couple of years now, sure wish I had bought this from a place I could have returned it to. If you need reading glasses like I do, you will need them to read the display as the the digits of data other than the heart rate are very tiny. And then the heart rate reading displays ""0"" half the time. Just changed both batteries yesterday and right in the middle of a vigerous workout it stopped displaying heart rate. Put on my wife's $19 Polar from Big 5 and got a steady reading for the rest of the ride.A plus is that it does provides average HR, althought for what good with only part of the workout active (don't think the 0 readings are included). On the down side: it does not provide maximum HR."
1,new watch didn't work,"The heartrate monitor function on this watch didn't work right out of the box. I tried everything, even replacing the battery in the transmitter and couldn't get the watch to recognize my heart rate or anyone elses. Amazon was great about taking the watch back but what a pain. This is the second x3hr I have ordered that has been defective. The first one was not from Amazon however and the screen froze then the battery died the day after I received it. These watches seem like a bargain for all of the functions they have, but they also seem to be unreliable."
2,Heart Rate Monitor Has No Heart,"It arrived in good condition. However, difficult to use and cannot seem to get the Heart Rate Monitor working properly in spite of doing all of the diagnostic tests."
1,Mistake,This watch has been a total waste of money. The temperature and altitude features are completely inaccurate and the heart rate monitor only reads part of the time. I would strongly recommend purchasing a different watch.
4,Black X3HR,"The watch is of good quality and does the things it says it will do. When I purchased this item, I was under the impression that it calculated altitude. It actually displays altitude based upon barometric pressure. The user must give the watch a baseline altitude for it to function correctly. Also, somewhat significant weather change can cause your altitude to display incorrectly. Perhaps this is a common way of measuring alititude, I don't know. I suppose for the utmost accuracy you'll need to go with a GPS enabled model. Overall, this watch is still a great product for the price, just be aware of how the product works."
1,suunto has very bad quality and expensive,"i bought the first one 3 years ago, and they replaced it after one year, suddenly stop working, the second one lasted almost 9 months, then failed too, and they replaced, the third one lasted 9 months and is going bad and i ran out of warranty, never dropped them or submerged in water, i treated my watch very gently, but is the quality of the product, keep away from this brand, when it worked it was accurate and i like it but they are disposable watches no longer than a year. they should be like a 20 dollar watch for the time they last."
4,great value,"I know this guy is out of production (or seems to be) but I have to add my voice to the positive reviews - I had one of these for probably three years, hiking, biking, swimming - it's prone to interference from other heart monitor watches but other than that, it's bulletproof.The easy change battery was awesome too because it does eat batteries maybe every month or two with active use.No complaints, tight build quality and now they've added temp to the firmware apparently. I'm back ordering my second one."
2,Worst altimeter watch I've owned,"This is my third Altimeter watch, my original Suunto ran like a champ for years until finally giving up 3 years ago. I then went to a Highgear, more accurate than mu original Suunto. When the face of my Highgear came apart for no reason, I returned it to REI and bought the X3HR.Negative- display items too small and often hard to read; it is strictly a secondary altimeter due to the small atitude display, by backlight quit working after 3 months.Positive- Smaller and less geeky than other altimeter watches"
4,Still one of my favorites by this group,"I listened to this cd today for first time in years and it still delivers. Los Sabrosos del Merengue a reputable PR merengue band has the talent to produce good merengue. Although the group always has members that come and go they still hold it together. This is one of their older albums (1995) but still could ignite any fiesta. The rhythm and pace is extremely upbeat and the lyrics will make you crack a smile. This one in my opinion is one of their best albums. Some of the great merengues in this album are: El cachetero, Se le moja la canoa, Botellon and Noviecita. This is a recommended and worthy purchase."
1,Conservative revisionist history,"Regrettably, I read this book hoping to gain another perspective in the name of honest inquiry. Alas, I was disappointed. Just as Crossan gives a rather left-slanted interpretation, so does Boyd give a right-leaning one. Please don't be fooled -- that although, like Crossan, Boyd presents a well-written book, he also fails to offer anything up rather than assumption. Perhaps Boyd's thinking is skewed by his born-again fundamentalism. Perhaps, like many literalists, he allows his own strict conservative views to intervene with his own brand of logic.In his defense, Boyd should at least be read for the ""conservative slant"" if nothing else. He does a good job at presenting his audience with a fine example of conservative Biblical interpretation.If you're a fundamentalist however, you'll probably disagree with my assessment."
3,I wish it was more fun to play,"It's decently designed and portable. I like that it's a very creative word game. I just wish it were more fun. My two technical criticisms: it's a little hard to pull the cubes out of the rack with your fingers and the racks are a bit hard for tiny fingers to open, once they've been snapped closed."
3,dvd please!,"""It is not a Wookie"". Like Teen Wolf, but funnier. Was sad to find out that this movie was not released on DVD. Some one out there in the universe please release this lost gem on DVD. I would even buy it on Blu ray."
4,Interesting Cast in a bad movie you'll Love!,A teenager (Adam Arkin) becomes a werewolf after a family vacation in Transylvania. NOT ON DVD!
2,not what i expected,"I hoped the video would show more about the reconstruction and explain more details. I also wanted to see something about how they restored the Philodemus papyri. Instead, it seemed to be an attempt at a sensationalized account of death at Pompeii and Herculaneum. I did learn some things, but it was not as informational as I thought it would be. I thought I would show it to my class, but I think it would be a waste of classtime."
5,Secrets of the Dead- Herculaneum Uncovered,Once again this DVD on Herculaneum is terrific and shows items of interest concerning our ancient history!
3,Not what I thought,"This is an unauthorized biography of Marilyn Manson's history through rare archival footage and interviews with friends, colleagues, and critics. Not a music video DVD..."
1,Polemic is not Science,"Especially the chapter ""Recherche de Josephine Deym"", written in a polemic style, is a futile attempt to discredit the evidence in favor of Josephine as the most likely ""candidate"" (seeBeethoven's Only Beloved: Josephine!: A Biography of the Only Woman Beethoven ever Loved)by pouring scornful ridicule on her ""advocates"". By (mis)interpreting letters around the time in question, speculates that Josephine and Stackelberg ""must"" have been (1) both in Vienna, (2) together and (3) happily so! Overall, sadly, disgraced by a prevailing misogynistic attitude."
5,Very good,I purchased it mainly for the 13 week walk/run program. Since I am only on week 2 it is hard to judge the effectiveness. The authors claim that it is designed to help the participant slowly increase endurance to avoid injuries so that at the end of the 13 weeks the participant can sustain a 45 minute run - I believe them. I am looking forward for the next 12 weeks to see where it gets me.Before it gets to the program it talks about why people run and the advantages running will bring into a person's life and I read some complaints about this but I found this is useful information especially for the person who is trying to start the program without an experienced runner at their side.
4,An absolutely beginner's guide to....,"...Running! This is a very decent introduction (and also highly motivational) for someone very new to running. In my humble opinion, this is not a book for even someone that is slightly advanced into running. If you are someone that has been into a program and can run 5Ks and want to improve your time or improve breathing skills, this is not the book for you. However, if you are just beginning to run (and want to motivate yourself), then this is a good book. That is the reason why I gave the book 4 stars because it says it is a beginner's runner book. I just assumed that I would find tips such as rythmic breathing or other skills that will help you run better. good luck and keep running because its good for you!"
4,wonderful start-up plans!,"This book is wonderful for the beginning runner or walker. It lays out specific 13-week training schedules and gives you lots of advice. It also includes little stories about all of the topics on almost every page, to give a personal side to the issues."
5,Complete and clear guide for new runner's,This book has everything you have to know to enter the runner's world.If you are a beginner its a clear guide to get hooked in a safe way with the sport. It leads you the way to build up your fitness status. Very good!!
3,Marathon Handy Dandy Book!,"This book is truly for the new runner who would like to get started and find their place/niche. As with everything, moderation is key so should you stay on the suggested path, I am sure you will succeed.Good Luck!"
2,common sense advice,"I should start off by saying the book acknowledges it is for beginning runners. However, the book is 168 pages long and the program starts on page 133. The first 133 pages discuss various subjects and gives advice. The advice includes, ""your feet should point straight forward and ahead,"" and, ""focus on what feels good and not what hurts."" The book could have been 25 pages and contained everything it now has that is worth knowing."
2,Good if you're in your 20's or 30's ... not so much in your 40's..,"I tried to follow the 13-week program and couldn't do it. I kept thinking 'I need more time to adapt'. I'm 45 years old. I'm 5'11"" 165lbs and used to be able to run 10k's with no or little training in my 20's. I'm still fairly fit through weight training but wanted to start running again. I've been following the 24-week program in the book ""Complete Book of Beginning Running"" by Amby Burfoot. And I can honestly say that her program is much more realistic for me. If anyone else feels defeated by this 13-week program, try the 24-week program that Amy espouses ... it's working!"
4,Watch the editions!!!,"Just a note to those that are interested in buying this book. The 13-week run/walk program was completely revised between the 2001 and 2005 editions of the book. The 2001 edition is a much gentler approach, while the 2005 edition assumes that you have a certain level of fitness. Just to illustrate: the very first session of the first week of the 13 week program in the 2005 edition calls for ""run 1 minute, walk 2 minutes; do this 12 times"" (the 9th time just about killed me), whereas the 2001 edition of the book starts with ""run 30 seconds, walk 4 minutes 30 seconds; do this 7 times"". So if you're more fit you may be happy with the 2005 edition, otherwise try to find the 2001 or 1999 editions of the book. Otherwise, I liked the book a lot."
2,dull,"I was rather diappointed in this collection. A few of the poems are very nice, but overall the work is bland and dull. The language is so pedestrian. This seems like a real half-hearted attempt at writing. I am sure Walker can do better."
4,I really wish I had that,"It is, in the hero's words, ""the absolute weapon against morons."" I really want one. Oh well, back to the real world.This is just about everything I want from Druillet. It has active, energetic drawing - somehow, everything is a verb. It has precise penwork that fills the panel. It has bizarre, otherwordly beings in a supernatural universe - except for the women, who tend not to live long. It has ---- well, no it doesn't. It doesn't have much of a plot, barely even a sequence of events. Or much regard for the one apparent female character, or for causality. C'mon. This is Druillet. You should have known better.This B&W; book is good for the Druillet hard-core, but beginners should look to Lone Sloane or others.// wiredweird(Reviewing the 1991 Dark Horse release under the same title.)"
5,Love this.,I rented this at the library and absolutely loved it. Freaking awesome. Ended up buying this for my Brothers birthday and he too enjoyed the film. Get it.
4,Meant to be watched more than once,"I only recently heard about this film and was delighted to find it available as an Amazon Instant Video. I have only watched it once - so far. I had to keep reminding myself that the film is set in 1969, but I know that if I am able to take the time to watch it two or three times more that I will be there in 1969 with the actors and that Withnail and I will be the type of movie that keeps showing you new things with each viewing. I may find myself coming back to upgrade my rating from four stars to five.I won't do a synopsis here, as there are currently more than 120 other reviews that tell you what the movie is about. What I will say is that the cinematography is richly beautiful, the locations both lush and dreary, the audio is extremely well done and the soundtrack is well worth purchasing separately and listening to again and again.I recommend this sad, funny, puzzling, tense, frustrating film for everyone."
2,Bad blu-ray,"I'm not rating the film but, the blu-ray disc...the film is 5 stars!I just purchased a blu-ray player and am upgrading my library...A perfect example of a good flick getting a bad, bad disc...sound and picture quality is poor.There was a warning on the disc before the film started that the transfer from from inferior source material.wish I had known this before I purchased the disc, it does not look much better than the DVD I own.I just had it in my mind to expect more from blu-ray...go figure."
5,A spell-binding exercise in drunken triviality,"Bruce Robinson's semi-autobiographical film is testament to his biting tongue; just as Kevin Smith's Clerks, the film has practically no plot. We simply view the drunken exploits of Marwood (a typically anxious McGann), and Withnail (the ferocious Grant). Fundamentally, the film is constructed around set pieces, all universally connected by the sozzled diatribes of Grant. Withnail and I is a film that will mesmerize you my the sheer chaos and inebriated mayhem that ensures."
4,Great Drinking movie for Monty Python Fans,"If you like dry English humor, as I do, you will LOVE this flick. Great movie to drink to you ponce. If you draw a Queen at Uncle Monty's you're doomed. See it, it's great. Also, it's produced by the Dark Horse himself!"
4,"Great movie, several different DVD editions available","This is yet another rerelease of one of the greatest dark comedy masterpieces of all time, Withnail and I.Firstly, there is a 3-disc 20th anniversary edition available that is a must for completists. Regular folk will prolly wanna stick to a single-disc release, maybe with some bonus features.Secondly, it is easy to find this as a Region 1, North American release, you don't have to buy the import (for just the regular DVD of the film). However, if you do purchase the import, Region 2/PAL DVD, don't fret. They're easy to play anywhere. If you don't want to spring for a multi-region or region-free DVD player, you can still play it on your computer (you might have to change your region code, which it will prompt you to do). I have Mac mini hooked up to a 42-inch flatscreen and have no trouble playing Region 2 DVDs.Hope that helps!"
5,"Quite simply, the great movie of all time...","Nothing uplifts my spirits more than watching ""Withnail and I."" It's so brilliant on so many levels. I saw it in the theatres 20 times and I've watched the DVD an equal number. Every time I laugh out loud. A phenomenal film."
4,Autobiographical tale...,"""Withnail and I"" (1986) is directed by Bruce Robinson (screenwriter for the Killing Fields). This black comedy is about two unemployed young actors who live in a squalid apartment in Camden in 1969. They decide that they need a break from city life and so take to the country where a flamboyantly gay uncle, named Monty (Richard Griffiths), has a cottage. Richard Grant is ""Withnail"" and ""I"" is Paul McGann. This was Grant's first film and helped launch his successful career. The movie is mostly an autobilographical story about Bruce Robinson's own life. Robinson was an actor himself, and played the role of Benvolio in Zeffirelli's film ""Romeo and Juliet""(1968).This film was apparently remastered and appears very clean. There are no special features of any kind on the blu-ray, though the Criterion dvd release from 2001 has a documentary about the film."
5,Hilarious and dark,"I had already seen this film many times, and I finally broke down and ordered a copy so I can watch it whenever I like. It's the kind of film that you either love or don't get, and I absolutely love it. It's full of quotable lines and damaged characters in funny situations. This movie deserves its cult status, in my opinion. If you like dark, quirky, British comedy, give this a go."
1,I was ashamed,"I read many great, raving reviews of this film, so I bought it. I have a moive night once a week for some friends. Last night we watched ""Withnail and I"", and ""The Hidden Fortress"". Well, the three other people and I all looked at each other at the end of withnail. We couldn't believe how unfunny it was. The acting was awlful. The actors seemed to be trying to hard to sell their lines. There was some good writing in it, but it was so forced, I kept waitng for it to be beleiveable but it never was. The drug dealer and uncle monty were the only good actors in the film. Sadly there time on screen was about a total of 15 minutes. Usually if I buy a DVD that costs 10 dollars or less I'm not too shocked that it sucks, but at the price this DVD is, I couldn't belive how bad it is. ""The Hidden Fortress"" was funnier."
3,Fear And Loathing In The U.K.,"How do you nutshell ""Withnail and I""? The most apt description I can think of is Hunter Thompson by way of Monty Python. That said I'm not sure of what to make of the flick. Sometimes these absurdist comedies work and some of them don't. In the case of this film sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's just strange for the sake of being strange. In other words there were bits that were hilarious and others that were just offputting. The film is helped immensely by it's engaging stars notably Richard E. Grant as the besotted Withnail but not enough to get it over the hump. I admire the film for it's ambition but ultimately it falls short in execution."
4,"Funny, harsh, dark cult movie","I took a chance on seeing this film based on internet reviews. And I am happy that I did. This movie is a character piece with a very basic plot. It is incredibly quotable and funny. Yet, it does show some harsh realism of alcohol addiction.Criterion's production history is stellar, so I'm sure that the DVD sound and picture quality are as buffed as possible. Unfortunately, it is still somewhat suboptimal by today's digital and DTS standards. The special features are excellent and funny, too!"
5,Hilarious!,"This is truly one of the funniest films I have ever seen. It made the African-born Grant (who, in his autobiography, refers to himself as Swaziboy) a star--and deservedly so. There is a scene, featuring a chicken, that a friend and I rewound and watched at least ten times, laughing ourselves into a state of pain. Welcome to the end of the 60s and two of the funniest characters (I, played by Paul McGann) ever to appear on film. This an absolute must-see."
5,unbelievably close to perfect!,"I cannot in one lifetime sing the praises of this film enough. While predominantly comedic, it is touching, saddening and though invoking. You are left with aching sides, and plenty of food for thought. This film is my favorite, and arguably one of the best of the twentieth century. It is the film for anyone with a love of British comedy."
2,British Classic in an outrageously bad new Image transfer,"I didn't think a company could stoop to issue a DVD transfer of such third-rate quality in this day & age. Weak, fuzzy, insubstantial, ghostly image. No extras. The golden age of SD DVD seems, sadly, behind us.The much criticized Criterion was better--and it wasn't even anamorphic. Don't be suckered into buying this.Shame on Image entertainment!"
2,The production on this DVD is poor,"Despite claiming use of the latest techniques, the video quality and sound mix is poor. Letterbox is used for the main feature, already cutting resolution. The colours are washed out and the picture lacks contrast.The 5.1 sound was handled quite badly, with voices inappropriately appearing in the rear (not only when narrating) and a lot of hiss. I've heard much better sound on movies much older.The (good) extra documentary was in anamorphic widescreen, giving the main feature itself an even more bedraggled appearance.Unfortunately, it will probably be some time before a better version appears. This is a well-loved movie which deserves far better treatment."
2,"Genius film, but this edited version is very disappointing.","I love this film, but as a resident in Japan I can only watch the US format.....several classic lines have been edited out, apparently only to shorten the running time. If you've seen the UK version this will be disappointing, however it is still a classic film!"
5,"I just heard this ""Jupiter"" on the radio","Wow! The finale of the Symphony 41 is exhilirating! What swing and rollicking good fun! I confess not to have heard any of the other symphonies on this set, but if the Jupiter is any indication, I'm in for a treat. The conductor is unknown to me, but his grip on the tempo and ensemble is fabulous. I just purchased this from a third-party, and am looking forward to a good couple of hours listening to this once I receive it. The Scottish ensemble sound great, and there is a sense of real music-making here.In general, while I'm not a Mozart afficionado, I tend to be very selective in my praise. I will add to this praise if I find more to laud in this release."
3,prepare for blisters...,"because that's what you'll get with these shoes. They're beautiful shoes, nice style, and the heel isn't high enough to make walking difficult. What does make walking difficult are the sides of the shoes..they pinch quite badly and rub your feet in all the wrong places. Every time I've worn them, I've ended up with some really bad blisters. So I'd recommend either wearing these shoes only for very short periods of time, or padding up any tender spots with bandaids or gauze so they don't blister your feet quite so badly. I've never had this problem with any of my other shoes, even dressy pumps and heels, so I barely wear these, which is a shame as they go so well with so many things."
5,Rhapsodie espagñole,"(Review of the 1988 disc that makes up half this collection)This is a stunner - some of the best Liszt playing I have heard. The rollicking aragonesca of the ""Rhapsodie"" inspires Hough to alpine feats of prestidigitation. I laughed with astonishment when I heard it. But for all of his super-pianism, his hallmark is control and refinement of tone. He's very much in the Earl Wild mold. Like Wild, his playing can verge at times on the precious as he strives for too delicate an effect. We never forget, however, that a unique intellect is at work. Our few misgivings pale beside music-making of this stature."
5,"A rest to my hands, a bless to my ears.","Once I've studied classic piano, then I gave up. Listening now to Hough, I realise how I could never be satisfied with my playing, cause if there's someone like him to play, I'm glad to be just a listener. I have other versions of these songs, but Hough's always seems to me like the original ones. ""Aprés Une Lecture de Dante"" is my definition of perfection and the rest of the album comes along."
4,"Coco Records, I'll take it anyway I can!","Who knows why, but many of the old Coco records releases are just not out on CD, or were at one time but no more. Enter the series of three CD releases called Classics in Latin Jazz, Experimental Latin Jazz, and Romantic Latin Jazz. In the three you will find a mix from those incredible old lp Coco Records releases by Eddie Palmieri (Sentido, the Sun of Latin Music, Live at the University of Puerto Rico) and Cortijo's Time Machine. Hey, if you can't find the original lps on CD, this is an alternative I wouldn't pass up. The sound is great, and while some of the cuts are short versions of the original LP songs, and at the end others fade out instead of going full length, it will bring back musical memories.Wish there was more information about the music and the players in the liners (there's none), but they have their reasons for doing what they do."
4,excellent,"spirited, fun, mid-priced modern instrument companion to Halstead's Hanover Band authentic instrument version."
4,"LOVIN"" IT","1)Today Upbeat song makes you feel good 5/52)Stay In Bed Days ok song a rock feel but her voice sounds good on it could have done without the little kids 3/53)Beautiful Girl a heartfelt ballad for her daughter 5/54)Music Of The Night i think anyone can dance to this song i love it 5/55)If I Had My Life Again A song that makes you think about the past not one of my favorites but listenable 3/56)In Too Deep i really never listen to this song very much unless i'm listing to the whole album 2/57)Sweet Pleasure I do not like this song at all 1/58)L.A State Of Mind ok song again not one of my fav's 2/59)Say,Say,Say Dont really like this song but she sounds good on the song 3/510)Bad Bad Girl Sounds like it should have came out in the 80's 2/511)Hold On A great way to end the album 5/5i think this a good album people should really buy it"
3,Scary gets California laze,"This time around Brown offers her second album. An effort created in her own studio for her own record label. L.A. State Of Mind is exactly what it says. The album is very laidback, sometimes excessively. She offers sunny optimism of the single ""Today,"" slight attitude on ""Bad Bad Girl,"" and chilled ice on the title track.Brown expresses the California haze with ""Stay In Bed Days"" and sings to her daughter ""Beautiful Girl.""The album is not eager to please, it takes its time to grow and does not have standouts, except for ""Music Of The Night (Perdido),"" which has an infectious Latin beat. Then she revisits sensual `80s staccato with ""Sweet Pleasure"" and ends with the bleak ballad ""Hold On""This album is to be approached with caution. However, that is not to say that it is in anyway dire."
5,Amazing Book,"If you like trickster tales or are interested in Native American folklore this is a great book. The stories are well told, the book itself is well organized. I love that the tales list what tribes they come from, it gives you a great sense of the different Trickster figures that appear in Native legends and stories. This is a must have book for anyone studying Native American stories and legends."
3,"Good, but racy","The stories are offered with little, if any, moral ending. I expected to read the stories and have a sentence or two at the end summarizing why (or why not) the described behaviour is bad.Also, one reviewer mentioned that the book is not for kids. I concur. This was supposed to be for my 14 year-old's birthday, but the numerous stories about ""interactions"" between animals and women was a bit too much for me to provide to my boy."
3,Not for beginners,This DVD is not for everyone. I have tried pilates and yoga but am not a dancer. Although it is interesting to see how Kries puts all three together it is very difficult to follow. She does not give instruction on the form nor does she give you much notice when changing from one move to another. If I had never practiced pilates or yoga I would be lost. If a beginner tried this they would not know how to do the moves properly. If you have experience in all three areas you may like this DVD but don't try it unless you're already familiar with yoga and pilates.
4,"U will start getting a lean, toned result.","You will definitely see your posture and notice your body toning and start getting leaner.I recommend you buy Pilates Workout for Dummies first, if this is the first time you do Pilates.She incorporates Yoga and Ballet. She also, informs you on the importance of breathing and contraction of your stomach. I really enjoy this workout. You will sweat, and notice a difference.The only reason I did not give it 5 Stars, was that she moves from one exercise to another without explaining them. This frustrated me at first, because I had to constantly stare atthe TV to make sure I was doing it right.But thanks to Pilates for dummies I now do this workout smoothly."
4,"It takes some getting used to, but you'll get results","These DVDs aren't perfect, yet they remain some of my favorites. Jennifer's cueing is off at times and I do wish she'd explain more physiology (which I know she knows).I find her workouts very relaxing and calming.(even the ""energizing"" ones.) I also find it very difficult to quit working out to her discs. I tell myself I'm going to do a 30 min. session and once that one ends I just have to do the next one. She makes it all feel so easy that you might not even realize how hard you've worked. You get your muscles warmed up and might even break a sweat. But you'll feel it the next day. And you'll notice it in the mirror. They even helped me quit smoking after 20+ years. (yep, I started when I just a young ballerina, 13y/o!)Definetly worth buying if you can get them at a good price."
2,Not her best,Her other earlier videos were much better. I don't seem to see the same results or feel the same energy with these.
4,quick and to the point,"The pilates method tape is a combination of yoga, resistance, light weights, stretching and the ""side series"". The excercises moved quick and I found this to be more yoga influenced rather than traditional pilates. I'm not sure if I am crazy about this tape yet. I love The Method - Pilates- Precision Toning tape I have not yet done the 3 Dimensional Toning yet but ....we will see."
2,Clumsy,"Probably a well written tale in Spanish, and a very good story, but the translation is clumsy and cumbersome. Ms. Soto needs a considerable amount of work on her English.I would love to read this book again, either in the original or in a translation by someone less prone to inventing inappropriate phrases that I'm sure the author did not intend."
5,Math and murder,"The author has chosen to set his story in Oxford among mathematicians, which initially appears odd, and remains so throughout the book. There is a lot of conversation about numbers, numbers theory, and various famous math folks, intersperced with murders (or what appear to be murders). The plot, shorn of the math parts, moves along briskly, and the ending does come as a shock, so the book is well worth reading, if you can handle the math!"
3,"Great story, awful ending","The story and characters were great. I won't give away the ending, but suffice it to say the ending wrapped up too neatly, was implausible, and uninteresting. Makes the reader feel cheated, especially given how good the book was until the last couple of chapters. Consider Christie's ABC Murders instead."
2,Math doesn't add up,"Couldn't resist buying this mystery boasting an Argentine writer and an Oxford university setting. I wish I had though. The plot is thin and the characters unevenly developed. The endless mathematics ""shoptalk"" was indecipherable and not particularly interesting for me. Ultimately the overfocus on the academic chatter buried the finer points of the plot line. By the end of the book, I was annoyed and uncaring about the fate of protagonist and other main characters."
3,"Good crime fiction, with a math backdrop but little math content","The fiction-math genre is full of books that don't really work, usually because either the mathematics is there artificially and obtrusively, or the mathematics is the main character and the fiction is of poor quality. Oxford murder's avoids these problems: it is a well constructed, well written piece of fiction, and though it has a coherent mathematical backdrop, there is actually precious little mathematics in the book. It seems that the small amount of math is does have, is enough to annoy some readers, but it may be not enough for enthusiasts. Still, a pleasant read."
2,Fast read!!,"But that's pretty much all this slim mystery has going for it. Others have noted various problems with this book -- weak characters, weak sense of place, stilted dialogue -- so I won't belabor them here. OM isn't such a 'bad' novel, really. It's just a completely trifling and unremarkable one, save in one respect: the author has a few pretty interesting things to say about math (more specifically, about meta-mathematics). It's all completely irrelevant to the story of course (my sympathies to those readers who found the philosophical bits in OM jarring). But considered in isolation, these bits were quite thought-provoking (albeit unoriginal). Hence, my second star -- in appreciation of certain authorial reflections, though not of the book as a whole. The book doesn't merit much more than 1 star. But as I say, it's a very fast read. So, no harm no foul."
2,Don't be misled.,The mathematical connections here are more peripheral than I was led to believe by the reviews. Overall this is a pretty generic (and short) story without covering any new ground or doing anything particularly well.
3,Pages missing,There were a couple of pages missing. I dont know why people would want to get pages from this book. The story wasnt very thrilling. Kind of a kids' book of puzzle with a little sex thrown in.
2,schizoid mystery,"This is a schizoid mystery. If youl;ike feeling claustrophobic, go for it. Other wise, skip it."
4,Mathematical Mystery for the non-Mathematician,"Martinez's THE OXFORD MURDERS brings the reader into two rarefied worlds -- high-level mathematical theory and Oxford University. Don't be intimidated by the mathematical subtext; Martinez makes it quite understandable (said the reviewer who never went beyond geometry). Morever, he's dealing with some of the ""sexier"" aspects of math: codes, logic, and great mysteries like Fermat's Last Theorem. The mystery itself is creative, although somewhat blandly presented. The characters are interesting enough to make up for the standard narrative format. I would definitely read another Martinez mystery, especially if the setting is Oxford and the focus is math (or ""maths,"" as they say in the UK)I must admit: I never did figure out the meaning and/or next character in the code shown on the cover and mentioned in the book. Did anyone out there figure it out?"
2,I was vamboozled,"The seller advertised, and I was looking for a Hunt C, not the Hunt. Took many hours to figure out how to use the thing, but after a couple of years I now trust it to get me around in the dark in an unknown forest. The maps for it are no longer available, and weren't available when I bought it!! Thanks Lowrance."
2,DVD from other countries put into a package for the US.,"I was disappointed with this purchase. When watching the dvd you will notice that the subtitles are always on and you'll have to turn them off manually at the start of each viewing. Also some parts were blacked out or distorted with pixles to cover up any or all nudity from the show, something which is uncensored here on the US show. The Seller should have stated that some of the seasons are not from the US HBO show and censored for other markets. With that being said purchase at your own risk....."
2,poor product,"gave to my husband for gift, opened first season to watch and disc so scratched we cant watch,,will not buy from amazon again"
4,Finally new stuff!,"This group's last CD from '98 sounded very electro-jazz-poppy, with a late 80's flair to their soft-synth arrangements.This new EP delivers 5 new more modern pop tracks. ""I Don't Dance"", and the title track ""Empty"" are the bomb for techno-dance fans. Casualty Park still keeps the art in music!"
3,Kind of a disapointing ending,"The book was well written for what it was. For someone who really follows the game it held some interesting hints. But overall for a ending of such a series it did not hold up. Like much of the series it was a bit disjointed, adding in a whole bunch of extra character/plots right at the end that added as many questions as it answered. Not a bad book and worth reading if you have put the time in on the rest of the series but not excellent."
1,"Kinkade, Painter of Dreck","Kinkade doesn't even paint his own paintings. His ""art"" is paint by the numbers dreck. He has staff that does the painting for him. Marketing is his real artistry. There is no soul in his work, only dollar signs."
1,Drivel,"Although my Grandmother would certainly have liked Kinkade's paintngs, I do not. Kinkade's work is poorly executed and show him up for what he is... a glorified background painter from Disney. These poor people who buy into the hipe of this so calle ""Painter of Light"" are being hoodwinked. People commonly think that they ""don't know art but I know what I like""! Think about this. When was the last time your preferences didn't change when you learned more about something. People who think of Kinkade as a :real"" artist are expressing thier own ignorance as to what artist means. All artists know where they fit in the hierarchy of art. Kinkade knows he's truly at the bottom.But my Grandma would still like it."
3,Gives a significant but not outstanding gain in signal strength,"I have a wifi connected computer in a camper outside my home, the camper has an aluminum shell and shields RF quite well. The Terk antenna made the difference between a marginal signal and a usable one, not as much as I was hoping for but enough to go from just a few megabits per second to 24 or more most of the time. My connection is now solid and not subject to the sporadic interruptions I was experiencing previously.If I were to do it again I'd probably spring a bit more cash and get an antenna with more gain but it's not worth sending this unit back.Bottom line: If your connection is just barely usable as is then this unit will do you some good. If you aren't getting anything with the stock antenna then my guess would be that this won't do the job."
3,Test not like the review in book,"This book provided an excellent review of many subjects. However, the actual test (I passed it!) was mostly all reading comp. with little math and science, no history (April 2001). I would only suggest this book if you really need to brush up on your basic skills. I would not rely on this for the test."
2,This is not accurate,"This book is not an accurate reflection as to what was actually tested July 2000. The book contained a large amount of math and the test did not. Further there were no History questions on the test. I studied this book intensely and it did not help me with the actual test. However, the book is a concise overview of the subjects so that one may brush up on their knowledge."
2,"overall, this was not a true portrayal of the last.","i bought this book to prepair for the last, language arts and science test. the practice test that were located in this book did not portray a realistic test. the format on the test was different than the three practice tests. i was extremely dissapointed."
2,Poorly Constructed Manual,I found this book to be inaccurate and filled with useless information. I wasted my money when purchasing this book. I do not recommend anyone doing the same.
1,Not the right size for m500,"I bought these replacements when I lost my original stylus. They came 3 weeks after I placed the order and they don't fit, they are too long for my palm m500 by about 4mm. Because of that size difference they stick out of the top and don't click into place like my old stylus. I am very dissapointed with the product. Don't buy this for your m500. Now I'll have to go buy real replacements at a store and trash these.Addendum: I bought Palm brand replacements for the tungsten e,c or w and these stylus work great, they really snap into place are made of metal and write better than the original one for my m500.P/N: 405-5911A ?"
1,Too large for M515,"These are too long to fit into the M515. They do not lock into place thus sliding out easily. I thought if I took care I could make it work but I lost one within hours of receiving the order. Don't waste your time waiting for this warped version, spend the extra bucks and order the stylus from Palm."
3,"You are all wrong, it does fit well","If you don't press the stylus a little hard after it has entered all the way down in the stylus craddle, it seems it is too large to fit. But don't be afraid, you won't break the palm, press it down firmly and it will lock well into place, fitting perfectly. I was also afraid when I bought this Belkin stylus pack, since I read your reviews, but they are indeed, wrong."
1,Rip off,Had to return it! It won't operate unless registered at a site that closed 2 years ago. No mention of this anywhere until you try and log on.
1,SportBrain istep Pedometer,"I am not happy with my SportBrain pedometer at all. When I went to the website to load the program, the website was no longer working. Now, I'm stuck with a useless pedometer!!!"
2,"Good products, bad company support","I purchased a very similar iStep X2 around a year and a half ago. It worked great, as described by other reviewers, with a fairly accurate step count, good upload capability, and many more features than I ever needed.However, the initial unit died within the first 6 months, and the warranty replacement died at about one and a half years. At this point SportBrain is saying since it only has a 1 year limited warranty they won't repair it, replace it, nor sell me a refurbished unit at a discount.If you are happy with having to replace it every year or two its a good product, but I expect a bit more longevity out of my purchases. The warranty is not listed for this product but I would guess that it is also only 1 year."
2,Website failing recently,"I've been using sportbrain pedometers since 2003, of various types. They have been enormously helpful in tracking my exercise goals for walking. Availability of their website is crucial. Until recently, I'd have given them at least 4 stars, despite the slow response to problems (which have to be reported on their website).WARNING:in the last few months, the website has been down a lot, sometimes for storing data, sometimes for looking at the data. I've not been able to store data or look at it for several days. If something isn't fixed soon, my pedometer will stop displaying steps - they need to be cleared regularly. And I'll have to use something else."
1,keeps falling off,"Making a pedometer that can talk to your computer and all the other fancy tricks that SportBrain put into this Pedometer are pointless if the damn thing won't stay on your belt. Walking is fine, but if you bend over, twist, turn, go to bathroom the pedometer falls off your belt and goes flying across the room. The frustration index is quite high. How can the thing count your steps if it won't stay on you?"
2,Academic Schubert and Mozart,"This was a disappointing album for me. While all the notes are there, and they are well recorded, the performances in both the Schubert and the Mozart lack the spark that would give them life. The Adagio and Rondo Concertante in F, however, is worth hearing, and rarely recorded."
1,Defective. Beware.,I've ordered two copies of this CD from Amazon.com and both have skipped at exactly the same spot (the 28 second mark on track 2). Before you order this title -- and it's a spirited live set -- make sure that the record label has fixed their mistake.
4,A Dangerous Mouring,Glad to see that Monk his beginning to get his memory back. I find that an interesting side story. Continues to hold my interest.
2,A Dangerous Mourning,"This second Monk novel ties up some of the strands from 'The Face Of A Stranger' and sees Monk stll coming to terms with his amnesia, and investigating another murder aided and abetted by Hester Latterly. Unfortunately if you've read just a few of Perry's murder mysteries a lot of 'A Dangerous Mourning' will feel very familiar. The same issues and plot contrivances. Like Charlotte Pitt in Callender Square, Hester goes undercover in the murder victim's house. This feeling is exacerbated by the often slow pace of the book, which seemingly has characters going over and over the same details again and again. It's good to see some interesting times ahead for Monk, and Hester's glimmer of romance is handled quite sweetly but this book just feels too routine to really succeed. As part of a series I think it has merit, as a murder mystery it's just a bit dull."
2,End of the series(for me!),"Having read the first ""Monk"" book, ""Face of a Stranger,"" I was excited when I received this offering. The excitement didn't last very long. Regretfully, I got half-way through and couldn't pick it up again. Bogged down in too much non-essential, confusing detail."
5,I can't believe all of the bad reviews!,"This novel was thrilling from start to finish and it left me guessing until the very end. I do agree that the book had too much information in it that really had nothing to do with the story, but all in all this was a thrilling and entertaining read!"
3,Blind woman looks for justice.,"The Queen of Made-For-TV drama, Victoria Principal, appears as a blind woman looking to avenge the death of her husband.Two robbers invade her home and torture her husband to death. Their biggest mistake is in leaving behind them an `eye-witness'. Frustratingly the police seem to agree with the killers and discount the evidence that she CAN offer (height, smells, and voices). Only one dedicated officer (handsome and widowed himself) believes in her and fights with his superiors to get her side of the story told.Finally she decides to take matters into her own hands and uses herself as bait to get the killers of her husband and vindication of her own abilities."
5,Nice Mallet,This is a big mamma jamma mallet and it does a great job. I had one of the smaller ones like it and the head wore out after about 10 years of serious beating. This one has the harder plastic head to sustain the abuse better.
5,"Fabulous camera, my gradeschooler is using it!","This is my first digital camera after upgrading from a point & shoot. I've never used any kind of manual controls before. However, within an hour of unpacking this camera & browsing the manual, I was taking macro shots of my daughters hermit crab in full manual mode. Cropping & blowing up the picture to 8x10 produced a gorgeous, finely detailed and colorful photo. My 12 year old spent the day playing with this camera and producing ""Ranger Rick"" quality photos. Great camera, easy to use, light weight, excellent close-up and zoom capability... what more could you want."
2,fulYmpus,"I want to bring up an issue here regarding the fact that this camera probably only accepts xD memory, which by the way is twice the price of common formats. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD. Together the people can control the market for our own good.."
5,Very Impressed,"I purchased the Olympus 730 Ultra Zoom and am very impressed. I had a difficult time finding the camera that I wanted. I wanted a burst mode so that I could take action shots as well as close ups. I just had the chance with our last snow to get pictures of some deer running across my pasture using the telefoto lense that came out as good as those in National Geographic. The pictures were clear as a bell and not even a hint of a blur. The low light shots that I have taken have also be of excellent quality. The pictures are clear and bright on the camera screen and down load easily to my computer. I am very, very pleased. Thanks Olympus; Murphy Brown"
5,Just what I wanted!,The product works great! It's a perfect thickener. Just remember a little goes a very long way.
3,Ok Documentary.,"Biggie & Tupac: The Story Behind the Murder of Rap's Biggest Superstar, I remember this dvd being for sale via a telephone/1800/website and ""Not available in stores"" and included a ""free"" mini poster, when I brought it for $24.99 +s/h. I was disappointed. not too much On pac, I am not a fan of Big, It was long, although it did present some good questions here and there.Sadly, like most after Pac's Death(Including Pac's Mom/Family and Ms.Wallace and Pdiddy and Co.), It's trying to profit off a Dead Man."
1,What a terrible movie...,"I have to say, I love Biggie and Tupac, but that was, quite possibly, the worst thing I have ever rented in my entire life. First off, the man who narrated it couldn't pronounce ""Tupac"". If that wasn't enough, he just jumped all over the place, stuck in a few interviews that had no relevance, threw in a couple scenes that made absolutely no sense, and didn't tell me ANYTHING I didn't already know. Furthermore, the man was boring to listen to, spoke in monotone, and made it evident he barely had any idea what he was talking about. If you're thinking of picking this up, think again. I suggest watching something more interesting.. like the microwave."
4,Ok!,"Bought it by mistake because I already watched this film years ago. Same all story and no results, which is sad."
5,Excellent,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. This is great to watch and gives a good sense of what may of gone on.
4,Bought as a gift,"I bought this as a gift so I'm not so sure how well it works. It had a sticker on the front that I was able to take off but had I known that it was going to have that huge price sticker on it, I might not have bought it..."
2,Biggie & Tupac Review,"I had high expectations for this DVD, but it wasn't what I expected. I don't think it was worth the money!"
4,I liked this,It has an honest in your face tone to it and the style of the interviews lends a high degree of credibility.The obvious reluctance of the people being interviewed makes it known that these murders were seriously planned by persons who can make ones life very uncomfortable..even cease.This is a highly believable documentary.That Suge has something to do with Tupac's 'disappearance' is wthout a doubt ...but I doubt the truth will ever be known.
5,A real good buy,"This album is not quite as good as Tq's first, but it is hard to improve on perfection. A good buy for hip hop, or R&B fans."
4,Not Second Fidlle,"Second Fiddle?I don't think so. If Mr. Everett had actually listened to even a few of ABBA's CDs he'd have noticed that Agnetha & Frida very often share leads on tracks. The remainder are usually evenly split between them (Agnetha singing lead on 2 songs, Frida doing the same)Frida's voice has always dominated ABBA songs, even when she's doing backup or harmony vocals. Not to bash Agnetha or anything, she has a fantastic soprano voice with an incredible range while Frida's mezzo-soprano is equally stunning. They're just DIFFERENT. And this is what makes the ABBA ""sound"" so special.In their later albums (Super Trouper, The Visitors) you really get to hear just how good these women are.....there're some incredible notes being hit on those songs. So if one can fault anything about this CD, it's because of the songs, NOT the singer. I still say it's good, but her ""Ensam"" CD from 1975 was better. Check it out."
3,Frida's voice sounds wonderful on this album,"I am not going to compare this album with ABBA or Agnetha. What's the use? After (and before!) ABBA, both women made music quite different from the famous ABBA sound. I personally like Frida's voice and solo work over Agnetha's, but that's just my opinion. As for this album, it's nice, but not her best. Some of the songs I really love (I Know There's Something Going On, Threnody, The Way You Do)), but some I don't particularly enjoy (I Got Something, Here We'll Stay). But in all, it's a great document of the early '80 pop-sound. Frida's voice to me was, and still is, one of the finest in pop music!"
1,Even her best is not very good,"This is Frida's best effort. But I must say that after my initial positive feeling, after all this time it does not stand out as a strong CD. Only the title track is still charming and powerful. The rest of the stuff doesn't create an album feel. It is more a collection of songs with no soul. The one exeption being 'You know what I mean'. This is the first and only moving piece which really shows Frida as a person. It's a shame she doesn't show more of herself. One wonders, if Phil Collins cannot make Frida shine, who can?"
1,Frida s**ks,"What a bad CD. I remembered it as a nice record. But it was years ago when I bought it on LP. Today I got the CD, and I am really dissapointed. It all sounds so oldfashioned. It has no soul. Only the tittle tracks is great. The rest is booooring. I still love Agnetha Faltskog's solo albums though!"
2,Why did you recommend this one,How did you get me from the Go-Go's to Frida. I mean this is one step away from ABBA and there is no way you can put ABBA and the Go-Go's in the same sentence. You blew it on this one.
4,"Frida is one foxy lady, and what a voice!","While i am not a huge ABBA fan, i will admit to liking some of thier songs. On e of those reasons is Frida. Sure Ana was cute, but i think that Frida was the whole package: beauty, mystery, and of course one heck of a voice. That same voice is apparent on her debut solso album. While i have not gotten achance to hear the whole album, it is still a great solid record with some great tracks. The title track is off the hook with one of the best beats ever in music. Frida is not only a great singer, but a goddess in my book. She was never a second fiddle to Ana and never will be."
1,Not finding what I'm looking for,"I am very tired of reviewers comparing Agnetha to Frida and vice-versa.I am interested in what reviewers thing of the CD, not who likes one better than the other. Combining their voices made the ABBA sound.I have heard many of their CD's and frankly I guess I just miss how theysounded with the group when singing solo. I long for the tempo and subjectmatter of the ABBA songs. I really haven't found what I'm looking for withtheir individual albums."
2,In defense of Frida - too,"I personally found Frida more attractive than Agnetha! True this album is not very good, but don't put all the blame on Frida, song writers and producers are also to blame. Frida IS a talented singer and has done wonderful songs with or without Agnetha (Check out the a cappella version of Dancing Queen on ""ABBA - 25year tribute""). We can't say that LLCool J or Snoop Doggy Dog are as talented.What about yourselves? Are you that talented to judge so harshly?Frida is great , Agentha is great, Benny & Bjorn are great and all of them were even better together as ABBA.. I miss them together. Let's hope for a reunion for new songs not remakes."
5,2007's Best Album (That No One's Heard),"Come for the funny, stay for the surprising wit, musical talent, and melody. The dark lyrics and sunny tunes make you laugh, then make think, then make you smile because you've realized some immortal truth about the universe. Or something. I don't know. It's hard for me to judge this album objectively because of my familiarity with it, but I can't recommend it enough. I tell all my friends about this album, and they always tell me the same thing: they hear a couple of verses and crack up a little, thinking it's some kind of gimmick, then get smacked unexpectedly with a deep affection for the song, the writer, and anyone who happens to be in the room at the time. Put this one in your car stereo and it'll never come out."
1,Goal based investigation,"Regulation proponent Ralph Nader directed his group in an effort to study monopolies and how government supports them. A pointed and accusatory read, big business is described as an irredeamable taskmaster who seeks to influence or control employees, competitors and consumers alike.Most of the facts and quotes that are used to support these broad wandering accusations and goals are obviously too twisted and disjointed for any real analysis. Quite clearly, they often mix opposing or incompatable findings. Sometimes the read is entertaining but more often it is like the ravings of the confused. Written in 71, printed in 73, this book is only good for historical research of Nader's writings or socialist based theories."
4,An Especially Good Read,"""Especially Father"" is the author's loving look at her extraordinary and exasperating father and, obliquely, his generation. Mostly set from the early 20th century up to World War II, Taber's book recounts the exploits and foibles of her geologist/explorer father who is a whirlwind of energy, opinion, and confidence. They are both funny and moving.She ends the book describing a family reunion in which her dynamo dad and his siblings, now quite aged, still manage to exude a vivacity and confidence that make the younger generations pale in comparison, in the self-doubting times of the postwar nuclear world. She wonders if her generation, or any subsequent generation, could ever have that same self-confidence and sense of competence and rightness.Taber wanted to capture a piece of that era on paper. She does so, and the reader is left with her same softly haunting images of a time and people now long gone."
1,Incipio's Handspring Treo Case - Don't bother,"This is a very poor design. It will probably be fine if it were larger, it is a struggle getting the Treo out. The side rocker switch was pushing too tightly against the case and constantly leave the unit turned on. I tried to expand the case by stuffing items in it but it was of little use. My recommendation is that you DON'T BUY THIS CASE.I found the case from Belkin to be better, my Treo glides in and out. I recommend BELKIN."
1,Look out!,"I found this case to be unusable. It is difficult to get my PDA in and out and considering it is a phone, time can be an issue when answering a call. I also found it provided very little protection. I would not recommend this case for a Treo 300."
1,Poor Me,"Hated it! Save your money and read A Child Called It. That's a book that covers abuse, if you're looking for abuse books. This book is attempting to shock with stories of how the author's brother urinates in his mouth, how he later has sexual relations with his sisters and brothers and then struggles with his own sexual identity. He later tells what a horrible husband and father he has become and then dedicates the book to his son as if that will cure the damage he has done. The authors trying to ride the coat tails of poor Elizabeth Smart and barely mentions anything about the abduction or Wanda Barzee. There are about 3 pages total about this and the rest of the book cover the author's life in boring detail. Seriously, there are much better books to read. If you want a good laugh, look at the author's own review of his book - funny how he tries to convince you that he's try to help anyone. How? My advice is to seek therapy and not by writing a book."
2,The truth of the matter- to the point,"I was eager to read this book after seeing the candid interviews on Oprah. After reading Raised by Wolves I realized I know what he needed. He spent the whole book telling us not showing us. It must have been incredibly painful to relive certain beatings from his father, incestuous mentions, and a mentally ill mother, however just stating some events and having no emotional feel to tie the reader into the terrified view means you lose the reader. A memoir is unique in that you can say I, you can personalize each detail and make us feel the pain. Instead it was painful at times to read a poorly expressed piece. It was a good beginning just not a finished piece."
4,"The Author, Derrick","This book is for people who come from abusive situations, buy it only if you're searching for some type of connection, or help with similar issues. I wrote this book to help people, not to get good reviews. Have a great day."
1,Jumps around more than a Black Widow spider on a hot plate,"Wicked Women - Black Widows, Child Killers, and Other Women In Crime by Betty Alt and Sandra Wells is poorly written, unfocused and overly researched to the point of tediousness. Long on footnotes, but strangely short on facts and vague on dates and places, this book is almost unreadable. Oddly, Alt and Wells seem to blame men for the wicked turn that women take. You are better off reading Mistresses of Mayhem: The Book of Women Criminals by Francine Hornberger or Look For the Woman by Jay Robert Nash if you want to read a comprehensive book about female criminals. It is a wonder how this book found a publisher."
5,Not a review,"This is not a review, I would simply point out that this book should be linked with the former Australian PM, Gough Whitlam, as the author of Matters for Judgement is the one who dismissed Whitlam."
3,Good Product,"This product worked well by keeping your feet really moisturized. Will most likely work wonders if you have a pedicure done first and then used this product. Also, sometimes the product will continue to foam when not in use (maybe because of climate??). If you have really bad feet according to the video on [...], you will need to get more than 1 can."
4,BookClub-in-a-Box,"I truly enjoyed this product. It gave a fast discussion and overview since I was unable to read the book before BookClub . I was able to participate in discussion since the ""Box"" had given all the right topic of discussion.I read it immediately upon its arrival and enjoyed thoroughly ."
5,awesome book when is the next one,Love the recipes. also the style of the book makes it so easy to use. can't wait for the next one
4,As a full DVD Rack,"I have two of these to hold my DvD collection. They're great! Simple in design and fairly fashionable (the more dvd's in it the more fashionable it looks!) The one poor thing about this design is that placed on carpet the DvD's have an easy time sliding out. For some reason the decline that the DvD's rest upon isn't steep enough for the to and frow the stand moves while placed on carpet.Another thing, if you have cats they'll knock your DvD's out all the time! I pick up DvD's off the floor in front of the rack because of their running behind it and knocking it about. This would be solved if the decline of the slots was a bit steeper, however, it's hardly a condition I think the designer had in mind.Good luck!"
4,MORE MODERN THAN YOU!,"An absolute must have for anyone with a love for the modernist design movement of the 50's and 60's, or if you're looking to stay consistent with a modernist theme while redecorating. It's so sleek and plastic and modular. I love it! And in the tradition of Taschen books, the price is well worth it!"
1,Disappointing,"Once you get past the lovely cover, the interior of this book consists entirely of magazine pages from the 1950's reproduced wholesale. While that means authenticity, it also means small,uninspiring black and white photography. Like looking at an old magazine, not the beautiful graphics one usually expects from Taschen."
1,kindle edition useless,"Beware of the kindle edition, it doesn't have page numbers. It is useless for any scholar work."
3,I must have read a different book,"I gave this 3 stars because he had some interesting points, but for the most part I didn't get a lot of what he was saying. I was annoyed by how he would sum up a point in Greek, or French - with no translation. Maybe I should know those languages, but I don't, so I missed out on much. I wanted there to be a more succinct explanation of what he was analyzing. I kept waiting for it to be stated as such, but it didn't occur. This book did not help me to solidify my definition of art, if anything, I am all the more confused. I am a visual artist and therefor I see the big picture. Analyzing is not my strength, so I will leave the analyzing to those of you for whom it is."
5,The un-Garfield,"This is a collection of one-page stories without text and unrelated to each other. The drawings are deceptively cute and more or less traditional. But the scripts are completely refreshing and read like something written in another planet. I don't know how to compare it to anything else, it is THAT original. The closest parallel I can find is to very old stuff like the Rarebit Fiend series by Winsor McKay or his Little Nemo, surreal and dream-like. But here there are no words, ever.Some of the stories are laugh out loud funny. Some are surreal. Some are just very cute. A few I just don't get and read to me more like a zen mantra. This is no Garfield, it is unlike any other type of humor you've ever encountered."
4,ordered for mom,I guess everything is ok- mom never said that there was a problem with the print cartridge so I will say liked it
4,ink,The product is what I ordered and was recieved in a envelope were the box was crushed but the ink was ok.No damage. Was recieved in a timely matter.I am a satifide person.
2,I was hoping for more...,"While I have always followed the age-old adage of ""You Get What You Pay For,"" I have to say that I was hoping for more, even in this price range. While I am no stranger to assembling furniture such as this, my cabinet had several pieces that just didn't quite line up and, consequently, caused me to re-drill a few holes.Additionally, while the black veneer is of the quality that one would expect in this range, it was already separating from one of the corners after only a week of ownership. Nothing a little wood glue didn't fix, but it's still a disappointment.Lastly, the cabinet is very wide but has a very shallow depth, causing it to be fairly unbalanced if you aren't careful about where you place your media. I initially loaded the cabinet at the top and left the bottom empty. It tipped over forward, spilling the contents and creating quite a mess. I shudder to think of the consequences if it had fallen on a child or a pet..."
1,Multimedia Storage,"There were many misaligned pre-drilled holes. I had to disassemble and drill new holes. Unit is still mis-aligned; doors scrape the base. Shelves sag. Very flimsy. I have done woodworking for many years and this is one of the worst projects I have seen. Sorry I bought; if there was provision for zero stars, this cabinet would've qualified."
4,cabinet review,The cabinet is good with the exceptions of larger boxed itwms do not fitinto it. Otherwise good product.
3,godd but better to take a class,"This video has a lot of interesting and useful information but I think you're better off taking a class and connecting with a teacher who can help you out if you have questions. However, don't take this class (Level III) if it's only offered on two days of four hours each--it's way too much information!"
1,Major editing needs to be done,I bought this book for a religion law class last semester. It's put together so weird it made it extremely hard to follow and even had our professor apologizing to us for the way it was structured. Avoid if you can.
4,"Good CD, good live","I saw these guys play last year and it was incredible. Didn't think a new recording would work, but Richard Lloyd's production is perfect - not too clean and not too sloppy. Just right. Most of the songs are darn good although I think some work better than others. Cheetah Chrome's vocals on ""Ain't it Fun"" tops Stiv Bators - although Cheetah is already too old to die young - and - RFTT's version of ""What Love Is"" definitely has more energy than the Dead Boys version.On the flip side, I think I prefer ""Caught with the Meat in Your Mouth"", the DB's vile reading of RFTT's ""I'm Never Gonna Kill Myself Again"".The jury's still out on which version of ""Final Solution"" I prefer, RFTT's or Pere Ubu's.There's lots to like - great guitar playing and drumming, good lyrics, great tunes. Get it!"
1,kitchen fire!,"We just had a small kitchen fire with ours. The oven worked great at first, I loved the rotisserie, convection, etc. Then the convection fan stopped working, but the other functions seemed ok, so we kept using it. Apparently this oven is made very cheaply, with cheap materials and low quality standards. The cord seemed ok,( I always check before I plug anything in) but it was not. Suddenly while I was cooking dinner there was a popping sound and flames shot out from the cord. The circuit breaker tripped in time, stopping the flames so we did not have major damage to the kitchen, but I will never purchase anything from hamilton beach ever again. This oven is a fire hazard and completely unacceptable."
3,H B Oven,"Good for baking, only takes slightly longer than regular oven and doesn't heat up the whole kitchen. Disappointed with the convection part. With my regular full-size oven, convection cooking cuts your time by several minutes; but, with this oven, it takes several minutes longer. As several have mentioned, rotisserie works only with a VERY small chicken or hen. Satisfied with the oven (baking) part, gave up with the rotisserie and convection. You have to be very careful pulling items out when you cook on the bottom rack--helps to lay a large hot pad on open door or you risk burning the back of your knuckles!"
3,Fair price & fair quality,"Good capacity, good price, but only fair quality. A temperature check using 2 oven thermometers between set temps of 350 to 450 showed actual temp was 40 - 60 degrees below the set point. At least part of this was probably due to the 1/8"" gap in the upper right corner of the door mentioned in other reviews. Oven should do the job OK if temp is verified and set accordingly.Amazon gets 5 stars. The oven was delivered in 5 days and the return process could not have been easier, with the oven picked up at our door."
2,Loved it at first...but now it's dead,"I got it in April 2010, thought it was the best thing ever! A tabletop convection oven...so cool. I didn't use it that much...maybe once a week or less. But when I went to use it the other day, only the timer worked. Ugh! It is desvastating. Iwould not recommend this product. Get a toaster oven instead."
1,Luck if this works for 1 year,"This oven worked well for about 10 months and then the heat would only come on if I stood and held the knob in the stay on position. When I called Hamilton Beach, they were willing to replace the oven for $25 shipping and handling, but the new one would have no warranty at all which means I may only get a month out of it. It seems like a replacement should be backed by a warranty."
5,Hamilton Beach Counter top oven w/rotisserie 31197,"Purchased through Amazon... So far, this has been a great countertop oven....have yet to use the rotisserie...if it works as well as the rest of the oven, you cannot go wrong."
2,JUST CUTE,"I decided to buy this unit after reading all the great reviews. I agree that this is a beautiful oven, however, it only worked for three months before calling it quits. The unit also gets extremely hot, so parents with small children, beware.Three days before finally breaking, the unit's timer would not stop sounding. I placed the timer on 0 and it continued to make the clicking sound. I finally had to unplug it from the outlet. Three days later I decided to use the unit again and smelled the units internal wires burning, sudenly the unit just cutoff completely."
2,Dial broken,"When I first got this oven, I was very happy with it. Within a couple of uses, the broil/bake/convection/ dial was sticking and was very difficult to turn.Last week, the spring inside the dial for the cooking time snapped and I am unable to turn the oven to any set time or turn it off. In order to use the oven, the dial is stuck on extend cooking time, and the entire unit needs to be unplugged after use.I would not buy this product again. This product was used several times a week after buying it almost 7 months ago."
2,"Knob stuck, uneven cooking.","We live in a TX apartment and purchased the oven a year ago in hopes of cutting down on our electric bill (both oven and a/c wise). The cheap pans that came with it are forgivable (make sure to cover in foil), but for some reason the temperature knob is stuck. The only time I can change the temperature is after the unit has been pre-heating for 10 or so minutes. In addition the convection feature heats unevenly. Food is burned on the edges while the middle is not quite done. The top rack cooks food quicker than the bottom rack. It's probably worth investing a little over $100 on a higher quality unit/brand.Amazon gets kudos for quick shipping!"
1,Product Details,"The Dimensions listed under Product Details are the measurements of the SHIPPING box -- who does that??? I looked at all the Hamilton Ovens trying to get a bigger interior space - none of them listed on Amazon are correct. Amazon did accept the return but it was a huge inconvenience of my personal time. I took the time to research and read specs, they could at least listed right specs."
5,Perfect,"I love this toaster oven. Its easy to clean, easy to use and has so much room that I barely use my big oven. When its hot outside who wants to turn on their oven. This toaster oven is perfect! I have other Hamilton Beach products and would recommend that brand to anyone. Thanks Hamilton Beach for so many excellent products!"
1,Ordered a New Oven and Got a refurbished one?,I ordered a new oven and I received a refurbished unit from TodaysConcept. I try to get a refund but I have been getting the runaround from both Amazon and TodaysConcept. Amazon does not call me as I have requested and TodaysConcept customer service just keep hanging up on me or they just absolutely dont answer their phones? I am very very disappointed with Amazon and TodaysConcept that they cannot refund my full purchase price. They want me to pay for shipping and I think that it is absurd that they make customer pay freight when it's their fault for sending refurbished unit when customers ordered new units. I doubt I will do business with Amazon or TodaysConcept ever again... As far as I am concern this has been the worst online shopping experience ever... Stay away from TodaysConcept they will rip you off.
1,Not satisfactory for my needs,"I purchased this oven toaster because I needed a small appliance to cure my polymer clay beads in, and thought this would do the trick. Unfortunately the door did not close properly, there was a gap when the door was closed through which the heat escaped. Consequently, the oven did not keep a constant temperature, something which is of utmost importance when curing polymer clay. The oven was also very tinny, the sides got uncomfortably warm. Unfortunately, althogether an unsatisfactory product for me. I have used other toaster ovens before for the same purpose and never had these problems."
4,countertop oven convection,"nice size, so far working as expected.don't use that often to give a better review."
3,Why did the price go up?,"How ironic that the price went up... It's on my wedding registry. I have seen before when something is on my wish list, the price goes up. That is very shady! Shame on you Amazon!"
3,Absolutely splendid for 3 months,This item cooks the best french fries (I like Zesties) and pizza and whole chickens... most used appliance I have until the convection blower went out after 3 months... now it's just the same as everyone else's toaster oven... sad but it was great while it lasted
5,Favorite Kitchen Tool,"We received this oven as a wedding gift 6 months ago. Since that time I can count on one hand the number of times I've turned on our main oven. We used this almost on a daily basis. It heats up in a fraction of the time my regular oven, uses less energy and heats food faster. I've cooked bread, cakes, pies, casseroles and much more using the convection oven. It also came in handy on Thanksgiving - no worries when something couldn't cook at the same temp as the turkey!This oven is also very user friendly and compact. It tucks easily into our pantry shelves yet has enough capacity to cook two pies.Note - this oven does not have a toaster function, although you can broil bread, but you have to manually flip it and it takes a while.I plan to buy one for my mother, and would recommend this oven to anyone who is tired of heating up their conventional oven to bake one item."
3,Degraded over time,"This started out working well. We use it a lot to quickly get meals ready. After about 10 months the fan motor started going out. The convection part now barely works. I am looking for another one, it won't be a Hamilton Beach."
2,Need the rotisserie parts to # 31197 ! Now what?!,"I'm getting so tired of looking for these missing parts! I have the oven and all that, but the rotisserie parts are missing. How am I going to use it?"
1,stopped working,Bought this oven with some high hopes of baking without the mess of having a large oven. All went well till a month after having it and using it only about 10 times it suddenly stopped working. No power. Nothing.
4,great addition to my kitchen,I am an older person--it is great not to have to bend over to bring things from my reguar oven. Plus it cooks so much faster. I love it!!
1,It is ok for an oven-the rotisserie in it is not good,"I did not buy this from Amazon-bought it from Kohl's, mainly for the rotisserie. The rotisserie feature does not work the way it is supposed to. The chicken drags every time it turns. It is very hard to use the rotisserie ensamble in it self- it is junk. This oven is not big enough to have a rotisserie in it. They also should put a light in it. I have had this oven for 2 months-Thank goodness I only paid Seventy some dollars for it. I would not buy it again. Also-I work alot of food events, working with roasters, I should have known better to buy this oven-I don't like Hamilton Beach Brand Their roaster oven is very hot-hard to control-my least favorite brand. But it is very cheap usually$ 40.00 on sale. I would buy Nesco or Kenmore any day over Hamilton Beach."
2,Needs digital timer.,"This is a good product with various features. Looked it up at manufacturer website and definitely would not have paid the MSRP of $149. The only thing I would change is that the timer should be digital, otherwise I would give it more stars."
3,"Wimpy rotisserie, don't count on it. Oven OK","The oven itself is spacious, and big enough for a couple of 12"" pizza pans. We use it outside on hot summer days in Dallas, when we don't want the heat in the house to make it harder (more expensive) on the air conditioning. As far as the rotisserie, it broke after 2 uses. Motor assembly for the R is very flimsy with very small plastic gears. If the food on the rotisserie bar gets jammed for even a short time, this feature will probably break. Also, if the ""load"" is at all unbalanced, the rotating motion is not smooth at all. I could not locate any replacement parts as the motor is made by some obscure company in China. If you really want a good compact rotisserie oven I recommend that you look elsewhere, especially to the Rhonco products."
3,Wonderful concept that falls short,"This product meets the claims of the review.There are two features I recommend be improved.First they need to insulate the unit because the outside of the unit really get hot,do not touch.It is an inconvenience to have to unplug the unit after each use as the manual cautions.You are afraid to leave it while plugged for fear that something might happen, not knowing what danger a plugged in unit pose even though is shut off.While I was aware of these features before I puchased this unit I find it odd.Apart from these two draw backs I love the unit.I have cooked fish, meat and baked goods.The convection feature makes great crispy frys.The delivery was on time and in perfect condition kudos to the shipping folks."
3,convection motor,I own the large capacity rotisserie convection oven. After owning it for 2 years the convection fan is dead. However as a broiler and rotisserie it still works. Now I have to have it repaired or get a new one.
1,A poor quality choice,"We bought this Hamilton Beach Mode l31197 toaster oven about 2 years ago.It worked OK until now when it wont heat.The temperature control contacts are fried and parts are not available so it's now junk.I hate having to throw out otherwise usable items that are not designed so they can be repaired and are engineered to last a bit beyond the warranty and hence end up as ""throw away"" scrap.Very disappointing!!I'll be wary of Hamilton Beach appliances from now on."
1,Set the school fire alarm on,"I bought this oven frm PC RICHARDS because they no longer carried The fabulous Farberware convection oven. Took it to a demo at a school and proceeded to make puff pastry sugar straws. Set the oven to stay on, convection, 450 degrees and inserted the 2 included trays with silpat liners and puff pastry straws. 10 minutes later, The top straws were burnt to a crisp and set off the fire alarm. The bottom tray barely cooked. (30 minutes later the fire department declared it was safe to return the building).I continued the demonstration, however, this time I assigned a person to watch the oven.....Again, same results...burned top tray, raw bottom tray. Repeated one more time, same reults. To call this a convection oven is ludicrous. This oven maybe large by toaster oven standards, but in reality one may only cook one tray at a time. Who needs such a big bulky product to cook 1 tray?Thankfully, PC Richards accepted the return. Good riddance to old trash!"
1,Don't waste ur $,bought this in December of 2010 and already broken. Just burnt out. Temperature and cooking time never accurate. The DeLonghi and Black and Decker I had previously were much better. And they lasted for years too!
2,disapointed,"We would expect better quality from Hamilton Beach and service from its distibutors. The Rotisserie works 3/4 way of the rotation, then it stops and drops free from the top position to the side. So that part that spins to the side never gets cooked. Called the seller wih little advice."
3,not bad,"The oven takes a while to heat up and is not very good for toasting. However, the price was right and the double oven comes in handy for a small family."
5,Excellent Oven,"This is my 2nd oven, both the same model. I used my first oven every day for everything for 7 years and just finally wore it out. I've lived in my home 3 years and have never used my built-in oven. This oven does everything! I am very pleased to have another one."
5,Better Than Expected,Fantastic product. You won't be disappointed. Cooks food fast and seems to add a better taste to things compared to using a traditional oven or toaster oven. I use it almost every day since I purchased it in November 2009.Definitely recommended!
3,Table Top Oven,"I've had the unit for 4 months now. The convection gave out a week ago. The rotissere is hard to work with. It only takes up to a 3 lb bird and then you still have to truss carefully and getting the balance right is problem. It does do a good job with roasts, but the booklet times are off, fortunately on the undercooked side. Just to be picky the temperature gauge is only marked in 100's and 150's you have to guesstimate if you need 325 or 375. That said, I love the oven itself and use it instead of my big oven for most things. I won't replace it but I am looking for another rotisserie."
3,well made but slow!,"I recived the oven in a short time, It looks very good, well made, lots of oven space, great shelf placement.Now the disappointments. The finish Bell dosen,t allways ring! The Oven takes for ever to reach operating temp, It takes 15 min to reach 350deg. Only takes 8 min to bake cookies, once it reaches the set temp, Compared to my past ovens, it has small quarts tubes, probably why it takes so long."
5,Love this oven,"This is the second one of these ovens we have had. The first one was so handy we finally wore it out but it lasted 4 or 5 years with constant use. We have a large built in oven that is seldom ever used because of this oven being so handy and large enough for most meals, The convection feature cooks much faster and real well. I will buy a third one if this one ever wears out. I recomend it to anyone."
3,loved it at first...,"Yes I loved my oven at first and bragged about it all the time. It bakes bread, roasts chickens, cooks frozen fries nice and crisp, but the convection feature was what I loved... it gave the chicken a nice crisp skin, made the pizza taste like you'd get at a pizzaria... but it quit after 3 months or so. So now it just bakes and broils. It does that well, so it's still a nice oven, but disappointing to have a non-convection oven again."
2,Probelm with max temp on convection,"This is a pretty good oven, but it's very limited on how high it will go in convection mode, as the power is too limited. I've found that it will not go higher than about 325 no matter where the temperature is set, and how long you preheat. The coils stay red hot (an issue with anything on the top shelf) and the temp never goes any higher. It's also too underpowered to really broil anything."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this from Kmart and used the bake, rotisserie and convection features.Pros: the size of the oven is more than adequate; the price was comparable; the rotisserie function worked well (be sure to keep the legs tied up, or they will drag at the bottom of the oven); and the front slide-out crumb tray made clean-up easier.Cons: the door does not shut flush, allowing heat to escape; the temperature dial knob broke after only a week of use; the included bake pans warped when baking; the temperature was off by at least 20 degrees.I returned to the store for a full refund."
4,Don't burn urself...,"I just purchased this item yesterday from Kohls for 78 dollars because I price matched the Walmart price...YAYThe only function I have used so far is the rotisserie. The instructions tell you to preheat first...I did that...Then, while trying to place the bird in the hot preheated oven I burned myself. It is quite a task to get the spic inside the oven. It's made like kinda like an arrow. You have to fit the pointed end in the hole which is impossible to do without burning something, your arm, clothing, potholders, etc.They should've made the spic easier to drop in like the one on the Foreman rotisserie."
2,Bottom Element Broken,"Based on your reviews, this oven had a lot of promise... but it never baked anything, everything was burnt on top and mushy runny on the inside.I have no other oven. After several months of owning it and trying to cook a variety of things, I discovered that the problem is the bottom element, it doesn't 'light'.I can broil things to my hearts content, but the temperature inside the over never gets above 250 degrees. I can't figure out how to get it fixed. I am very disappointed."
1,"Works ok, for its short life...","The first thing I used this oven for was cooking 2 pizzas. Don't bother as they won't cook evenly unless you rotate them halfway through, or one will be cooked on top, but not on bottom, and the other is opposite. I didn't have problems with rotisserie, convection cooking, or broiling. The timer was loose though, and I couldn't tell how long it would run. Then, several months later, it just died. No power at all, no light, no heat, no fan, no rotation. I guess I won't be considering Hamilton Beach again in the future."
3,great but didn't last long,Loved this oven while it worked. It did get really hot on outside when on but used the convention a lot. The timer broke after about 15 months and then the oven wouldnot come on. Price came down after I bought it so will not buy again. Size was a problem too. It was bulky and tall and took up a lot of counter space.
1,Products reach,"Has been delayed from the scheduled arrival of the goods, there was no explanation from the seller. Please ship it soon anyway."
1,Hamilton Beach 31197 Countertop oven,"Per the packaging and information on the box, this was supposed to have two oven racks included, which were not in the package when I received it. I sent it back."
3,Review,"Still havent recieved outfit yet, been waiting for about 5 weeks or so now. Seller was quick to contact when item was shipped, however will recieve item after halloween, so a bit disapointed. All in all though contact level was good. Just hope sender responds to problem."
5,Fantastic,"I first heard ""Language"" on Radio New Zealand International about a month ago and knew that I needed to hear more. This was the first album of hers I purchased and there isn't a track that I don't like. This album takes her back to her Cook Island Roots. ""U Soul Me"", ""State of Grace"" and ""There's a Place"" are top drawer. The backup vocals are from choirs from the Cook Islands Christian Church. 'If you like Gospel style music with a little Polynesian twist this album is for you!"
4,"Jewish Settlers in Early St. Louis, Missouri","Many Polish, German and Bohemian Jewish settlers traveled to St. Louis in the 1800's because of the growing community of Jews there, and the ease of travel over major rivers. The community developed from around 1810 on through the end of the 19th century and continues today.This book documents the history of large numbers of Jewish families and synagogues, schools and business in the St. Louis area. Using newspapers, city and county records, published works and genealogy studies Ehrlich has provided a valuable resource for students and historians alike."
4,Very interesting book!,This is a good book for people who know a bit about Boston Terriers. It shows a lot of pictures of famous Bostons throughout the years and has a good chapter about how the Boston Terrier was created. This is a great book but doesn't have a lot of information for people whom are new to the breed. I don't mean you have to be an expert to understand it but it would be useful to know the basics of the breed before reading the book. I thought it was great and would recommend it to most people.
2,Failed?,"I purchased this Gates tensioner along with a newGates drive beltandidler pullyfor my 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan (3.8L engine). I chose to replace these items as a part of routine maintenance since it hadn't been done in over 90K miles. While installing the tensioner, I noticed that the OEM tensioner that I was replacing was a Dayco unit. After I was done, all seemed well until about a month later, the belt started squealing briefly on cold start-ups. Then as the days went by it got worse - the squealing was happening for the first few minutes of driving. Then it started happening whenever the van was idling. This annoyed the heck out of my wife, so off I went to repair the problem.I replaced both the tensioner and the drive belt again with Dayco parts. That fixed it, and seven months later, the drive belt system is still quiet. Seems a bit odd since I've never had problems with Gates belts/tensioners in the past. But lesson learned. :)"
2,"Sentimental, but awfully boring","I probably would have enjoyed this better if I hadn't tried to watch the stories back to back. Spread over a few weeks, they would probably be much more entertaining. A few of the stories moved so slowly, it became difficult to sit through them. I can say with confidence that if I paid $48, I would have been dreadfully disappointed with this series. Since I bought it used, it was a little less painful. The stories do encourage self reflection, which should count for something. (two stars, to be exact) People probably could identify with at least one lead character. I was hoping for a good chick flick type anime, but this one was severely lacking something. I guess that would be the entertainment factor."
3,Like Movie like Book,"If you've seen the movie, you've read the book. It's pretty much the same story with minor changes. I was really hoping for more info about the Cenobites, but no such luck."
3,Barker is great...kindle price isn't,7.99 for essentially a short story...not worth the price. First book I purchased on kindle...next time I'll make a wiser choice.
5,Very good!,"I watched ""Hellraiser"" (the film this novella ended up being) several years ago, and I vividly remember the hideous graphic quality of the violence described on film. In the book, it's just as graphic if not more. Barker dabbles in hellacious imagery, torture, eroticism. It's a very short book but shockingly effective in its purpose of leaving the reader disturbed throughout the story's development, but at the same time anxious to see what will happen. For fans of horror written with style, this is the kind of book that needs to be on their bookshelf."
4,A very good horror novel,"I enjoyed reading this book. I liked the book better than the film it inspired (Hellraiser), the book left more to the imagination and allowed a better insight into the characters in the story.This was the first long story (i.e. not short story) that I have read by clive barker. I now intend to read some more of his longer works like 'The Damnation Game' and 'Cabal'.This short novel was very well written and had a very good storyline, I would recommend it to any horror fan. I may very well read this book again soon.Although I really enjoyed this book I don't feel it is of five star quality, it's nearly there but not quite. If I could give four and a half stars I would."
3,"Beautifully worded, stylish, intelligent, but needs more","Clive Barkers talent with words shows through from page one. This man can take a horrible event and make it SOUND picturesque. The cenobites are here in all their glory, but they're not shown enough for my liking, and aren't sketched out one bit. The other characters also aren't - they seemed to be multi-dimensional but not enough is known about them. The pace of the novel is strong and swift, but it could have worked out better in a longer length. One thing that remains memorable is the superb atmosphere; dark, damp, depressing, gripping, haunting, and so much more than even that. This is an entertaining, thought-provoking book that disturbs, creeps the reader out, and keeps them reading - but it's just not that memorable when everything is said and done."
4,Very good book....,Creepy....a little scary....great premise....but I wanted more!!! Wanted more detail...more of a story. But overall a great Barker story. Love him.
5,Review of The Hellbound Heart,"The line between pleasure and pain is often so thin as to be completely nonexistent. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of sadomasochism knows that receiving and inflicting pain can be a singularly euphoric experience. Few books ever explore this dichotomy as openly as The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker. Barker managers to plum the common human psyche, the dark recesses of our collective unconscious so to speak, and present a vision that can be seen as a cautionary morality play. Because sexuality is a primary impulse (in much the same way that food is) it can be both exhilarating and dangerous. Barker captures the darkest aspects of human sexuality in his tale.To read the rest of this review, please visit my blog The King's Crier: Book Reviews on Blogger."
3,TOTALLY different from the movie version!,"I hate to give this book just an ""OK"" revue, but that is what it was - just ""OK."" It is COMPLETELY different than the movie version. It is odd because in this book, the Cenobites actually are written in a way that they kinda expresscompassion in an odd way to their subjects (the movie version Cenobites would have never said or done some of the things that they do in this book). There were a lot of holes in the story at the end (how did Kirsty get out of the hospital?, among many others. Also, the Cenobites were hardly in it).The ending seemed abrupt, too. it felt like it was cut-off before a proper ending could be thought of.Oh well, the book wasn't bad.....just incomplete, really."
2,"Sigh, whatever","Movie or book, same thing. Save yer cash and borrow or rent the movie.nd please DO NOT go past the third film."
4,Tear your soul apart,"I just finished this quick read and was not disappointed. I've always been a horror fan and have seen the Hellraiser movies from way back when I was a kid. I felt the book was very close to the movie (probably because Clive Barker Directed the movie), but still held my attention.This is the first time I've read a Barker book and expected something a lot more sexually twisted, mostly from reading wikipedia summaries of some of his work, it didnt though.The only thing I wanted more out of this 164 page book was the Cenobites. The creatures that know pleasure in a very different way than humans, to the dismay of some of their victims. Other than that I thought it was a good horror book and may read some of his other work."
4,A beautiful (terrifying) edition,"The Hellbound Heart was originally written before Clive Barker became ""The Future Of Horror"". This is what one would expect from a seasoned writer with years of 'getting away with it' behind him. It also shows what was left out of the filmed version (we'll see what the remake brings). This is a stunning edition with original cenobite designs drawn by Clive as well as the original first chapter reprinted with annotations and notes by the author. A must for Clive fans. If you're new to the mans writings be prepared to sleep with the light on for quite a while."
3,a bit of titllating fun...,"...a short work...a little grisly, but intriguing. the film ""Hellraiser"" was based on this novella. If you can get your hands on a copy, it's worth a read...esp. for Barker fans."
4,"Pretty good, somewhere between Goosebumps and a real book","OK, so maybe that title was a little rough. :)I liked The Hellbound Heart because it was easy to get into, yet it kept my attention without letting me get bored at all. It was a little bit straightforward, but I prefer that than losing track of all the characters in something like Ocean's 11. :pIf you have a 4-5 hour plane flight, this is the perfect way to spend that time. (That's where I read it)"
3,On the way to hell,"This is a pleasingly short book on which the horror classic Hellraiser is based. For once I really would rather watch the film than read the book, the story is sluggish to say the least. Based around the Lemarchand box and its ability to conjure up the cenobites who will lead you to pleasures untold is a good premise but one that hasn't been given that classic Clive Barker touch, maybe the problem is it is all set in ""the real world"" and not in one of his fantastical places - something which he does far, far better.Whilst it will fill a rainy afternoon quite enjoyably it is not one that you will want to pick up time and time again."
2,Thoroughly disappointed!,I was excited when i started playing it because it was exactly what i was looking for until i realized that my data couldn't be saved! Like a true die-hard fan i tried to just keep the game on since i couldn't save it but then right after about 10hr of game play the game had a glitch and froze on me so i couldn't even do that. If i knew this was going to happen i wouldn't have bought the game!
3,Ok,Game came broken and freezes a lot to the point that it Does not work at all. I sent in a return and fortunately i got my money back very quickly.
5,Kids Love It!!,"The kids love these pokemon games!! I think they are a bit repetitave and they all seem the same under different names and color; but, then again, I don't play them...the kids do!!"
4,fake game,"The game we recieved was a fake but once we notified the seller, they refunded my money. They were great and gave no hassle. The game was bad but the seller turned out to be an up-standing guy."
3,Game deletes saved games,This game deletes saved games and it goes blank when you try to fight your rival on the cruise ship this guy totally jipped me and i want my money back...I have contacted him and he wont contact me back he is a complete jerk and i will never ever buy anything from him again i suggest you get games from somewhere else that actually check the statues and working order of it games
3,Highly dissapointed for a pokemon game...,"This game is okay, but it is unoriginal. The game structure is a little choppy, and it is harder to raise pokemon.The biggest problem is the strict trading center. You need to have a wireless connection to trade with ruby or sapphire. :("
4,Pokemon Leaf Green is awesome,"I like Pokemon leaf green because it gives you free will to do what you wan'na do.It is also cool because you can trade with Pokemon firered,Emerald,sapphire,and Ruby so you can trade with your friends.In conclusion it is an awesome game!!!"
3,Pokemon Leaf Green,"These games are great for the gameboy advance, being that they last for ages before the kids can get bored with them as there are so many levels and different pokemon to battle and collect. The downside, and it's a big one, is that there's so much content, the gameboy advance cannot deal with it. If it's not the content, then it's the game itself as it crashes on a regular basis which has caused many tears to be shed as pokemon and level achievements have been totally wiped. This seems to be the problem with a few of the pokemon GBA games. This game however has been played on the nintendo DS lite with no problems."
4,grantman,Enjoyed. Able to share with younger brothers. Could not get this version everywhere was glad when we received it quickly and in good condition. Still like the Pokemon games.
1,HATE IT,I honestly cannot beileve my package is taking so long to get here. It has spent 4 days in the same place. I am out raged and I will not buy stuff for my son from you any more.
1,The game was like playing a terribly made bootleg copy,"The cartridge I got had no visible defects and I was quite impressed with the shipping speed. However, as soon as I used the game, it stopped saving and caused me to restart every time I turned the power off. Then the game simply stopped working and causing the game to pull up a blank screen whenever I tried it."
5,Love this so much!!,I like the fact that LeafGreen has a great reply value; I've played it 5 or 6 times over already!I really enjoy the game; it's engaging and there are plenty of legendaries to be caught.It actually felt pretty challenging and kept me entertained.This is definitley worth buying.
5,Pure Nostalgia,"Boy does this game bring back childhood memories. My first ever game was Pokemon Yellow. The sprites in Leaf Green are almost the same as Yellow, and the battles seem quicker than in the new Platinum. Other than that the game mechanics are the same. Some say it's outdated, I say why fix it if it ain't broke. If future Pokemon remakes are this good, I'm gonna pick up the Pokemon Gold remake when it comes out next year on day one! A++"
2,"Good Music, But...","THE BLUE NOTE YEARS has 16 songs from 1972-1976; three are live recordings (1, 10, 11) from 1973.The music is good, but the packaging is trash. While the recording/release dates are provided via publishing/copyright years, little else is provided: no albums of origin, musician personnel, chart info, etc. There is no other photo included other than the same couple black & white photos used on the cover. The essay by Dean Rudland is unremarkable at best; it is poorly punctuated and printed in a difficult-to-read cursive font.But while the booklet is lacking, the music is enjoyable and the sound quality is good.Stateside/EMI did a much better job with their Baby Washington collection.Note: Only tracks 3 & 4 are from 1976 and 5 & 6 are from 1974; the other twelve tracks are from 1972 or 1973."
4,good information,this book is full of good information and helpful hints. written from an understanding and empathetic perspective. The book was in obviously used but good shape. no complaints.
1,Wrong Audience,"This book is really good for people who aren't real alcoholics. For a real alcoholic to try the things suggested in the living sober book means that they will almost certainly relapse. It is a book created for people who are hard drinkers, but not real alcoholics. It suggests many methods which have no proven efficacy, and are simply ways to avoid doing what you actually need to do (the 12 Steps). So for any alcoholic considering using this book as a tool for recovery I would suggest instead looking at the Big Book of alcoholics anonymous, as it contains the program of action which WILL work for anyone who is a real alcoholic."
1,UGH!,"Don't be fooled by the $5 subscription price, as this ""magazine"" is just pages of ads for home design companies located in Long Island, New York. My first issue contained not even one article -- just a series of ads. On the plus side, one call to Amazon led to a $5 refund.Magazine: REALLY BADAmazon Customer Service: EXCELLENT"
3,Who lives here?,This magazine is definitely not intended for working class folks. The designs and materials are quite extravagant. Makes me wonder who lives in these places.
2,MAGAZINE FOR SUPER RICH ONLY; NOTHING FOR GENERAL PUBLIC,"I got this magazine at a discount rate, hoping to see different ideas to design and upgrade rooms because home decorating is not my forte. This magazine is full of pictures of homes and products that cost HUGE amounts of money. I gave it two stars only because the right audience might find it inspiring- perhaps upcoming architects or insanely rich people who have no idea how to decorate? No one I know could come close to actually affording the lavish home and room decor featured in the articles and ads. If you don't make millions per year, I don't think this mag will appeal unless you are someone who is entertained by merely seeing the homes of extremely rich people. Personally, I honestly put it in the recycling bin as soon as it comes, because there is nothing in this magazine that I can relate to or remotely afford. (Even if I did have that kind of money, I can't imagine paying the insane prices listed on the items featured anyway.)"
1,Don't waste your money on it!,"This magazine pretty much went straight to the thrash as soon as it got to me. There is absolutely no useful info in the magazine. I'm very disappointed with the subscription. There are just too many ads. The content is like one of those free magazines that you can pick off the street.I tried to be a good citizen, asking them to stop sending me the magazine without a refund. But I still receive it in the mail. I feel bad about wasting the paper. Good thing is the subscription will end in March."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I was curious about this publication but was extremely disappointed after taking a chance on a one year subscription. The name is deceiving - then again, ""House"" is pretty dull. This magazine doesn't have the creativity, breadth, expertise or panache that other publications can offer. The photos are boring. The writing is bland. The society photos are irrelevant. Save your money - House Beautiful, Elle Decor and Architectural Digest continue to provide inspiration excellence for the decorator at all levels."
1,Yet to Receive Service,"This product/magazine was ordered on 1/30/2007, as of 4/5/4007 I have not received any issues! Thus, giving the magazine a rating of One Star is based on the expectation of hoping to receive it soon!"
3,"Nice bike, but the assembly...","This balance bike is nice enough, and it's certainly a better option than spending nearly $300 for a like-a-bike. I went back and forth between this and the Skoot, but after reading the customer reviews for the Skoot, I decided on the Sprint.The bike is attractive and well made, and my daughter will love it, but the assembly is the biggest pain I've had in recent memory. I am usually fine with assembling just about anything, but this bike had me spouting some very un-Christmasy words, lol The directions are minimal to say the least, basically just a few sentences and an exploded diagram. Add to this the fact that several of the pieces need to be assembled in a specific order. Once they are put together, they are next to impossible to take apart again without causing damage. You need to be certain you have it correct the first time. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the seat height adjuster is awkward."
3,"good concept, overpriced for quality","The concept is good. I think my 3 y/o will easily be able to ride a 2-wheeler thanks to it. But for over $100, I'm not impressed. The quality is so-so and the directions to put it together were the absolute worst--it comes w/ a manual of pictures and warnings in 5 different languages, but only 2 or 3 sentences on how to put the silly thing together. Very vexing. The seat ahdn handlebar adjustments aren't as sturdy as they could be, either. If Kettler is a German product, perhaps the exchange rate is the issue, because I seriously don't think this bike is worth more than $50. Get a balance bike, but if you want to save money, try another brand.Coming back to edit that my child was riding a regular bike around 3.5 and took off his training wheels less than a year later, so the balance bike works! I'm still complaining about the hard to adjust seat, though, as we introduce it to child #2."
1,Too Heavy,"Too heavy for my 28 month old, very strong grand daughter. Would have been better off with a lighter weight plastic bike. Definately not worth the price. One fall, not very serious, but the weight of the bike on her leg scared her."
2,I don't get it.,"We bought my daughter and son regular 12"" bikes and left off the pedals and training wheels. They scooted around for a few weeks and when we put the pedals on, my daughter took off like a pro. (My son has autism and it's taking him a little longer, but his balance is getting REALLY good) So... can someone explain to me why anyone would want to spend 80-100 dollars on one of these ""balance"" or ""skuut"" bikes when you can spend $50 at Walmart for a regular 12"" bike that they can eventually RIDE for real? If I had bought one of these balance or Skuut bikes, I'd have to go buy a regular bike 3 weeks later anyway. You can do this for lots cheaper. Sorry. I don't get it."
4,"Nice toy, but not used.","My son never used this. I bought it and have had it around for a couple of years as he learned to ride a bike. He's now 5 and rides bike very well without training wheels, but not as a result of this training bike. It's well built, and may work for some."
3,"nice, but overpriced",Bought one of these for around $100 and liked it. Then my neighbor picked up a popular competitor's model from KinderBike. She paid less than half of what I paid (I believe around $50 retail) and her son was wizzing around on it at barely 2 years of age! Her bike also had a quick release on the seat for easy adjusment. Both versions were comparable and effective.
4,awesome product,"We got this for my son's second b-day. He's of average (or a bit below) height and with the seat all the way down it was a bit too big. He was still able to walk with it and within a month or two had grown tall enough to use the seat. After 2+ months of riding, he's got the concept down and my husband has to jog to keep up. He absolutely loves it!! It's a great way to tire out an active toddler!! I highly recommend this product. I can't wait to see how much it helps him when he tries a real bike...I wouldn't be surprised if we skip the training wheels altogether. I would have given it 5 stars but my husband (who worked in a bike shop) says his only complaint is that it could be constructed better (i.e., better quality materials)."
2,Intelligent-- but poor recording!!!,"This recording is so *distant*, so *muddled*, I honestly thought something was wrong with my speakers. I got out another recording and saw that this was just very poorly recorded.Having said that, in the one listen I've given it, there were interesting things going on-- and if it were a tolerable recording, I'd be very interested to listen many times more! And yet...And-- because of this cruddy recording, I am very hesitant to get any of Norrington's other Mahler recordings... Does anybody want to reassure me that some of Norrington's other Mahler is actually tolerably recorded?"
1,Returned,"This ""case"" is NOT worth the money. It's hard to use the buttons when my Sony Clie is in it. You can't charge your Sony Clie with the case on, so you are constantly taking it in and out of the case. I also didn't like the quality of the case itself. It had a huge company logo on the front as well.I returned mine."
2,There are many other receivers that are MUCH better,"I wouldn't recommend this receiver. I previously had a Delphi SkiFi and my husband had an Audiovox. unfortunately, they both got stolen. So this sportscaster was my replacement - it was the 'special' that XM was running at the time. compared to these other two receivers, this one is terrible. it's very cheaply made; the remote is unsatisfactory - cheap buttons and controls that don't always work correctly; the mounting clip is poorly designed/made...i don't even use it anymore. the size is nice b/c it fits easily into any space in my 4runner. However, the screen display is also terrible and very cheap. Not as must customization as the others. I would suggest paying a little extra $$ for a much better receiver! I'm actually pretty disappointed that XM is even selling such a piece of junk product."
5,Great purchase,"I'm tech challenged, so I did ask someone to help me connect this, but in the end I love it and couldn't live without it!!"
5,"No Problems, Easy to Use",I have owned the sportcaster for about a year and use it both in the car and home. I use the suction cup mount on the car windshield and it has never slipped off. The ease of use and signal is better than my stolen audiovox.The remote is simple enough to setup without directions and very easy to use. Try one and I think you'll be happy with the unit.
4,Great!,"To the ""cop-out ending"" guy - this is a true story, as I was told at the NYC screening of the movie by Eitan Fox himself, so too bad if it wasn't real enough for you.To everyone else - simply a great film. Definitely get this one."
4,Military liason,"This unusual film tells a tale of forbidden love between 2 Israeli Army Officers. It is tender and quite real. It just shows that it can and does happen in the ""don't ask, don't tell Armies"". Thanks Bill C."
4,poignant without being whiney,"During its short length (71 minutes), this movie manages to provide commentary of the hardships of war, homosexuality, loving in the military, and relationships with the family. The beginning is a bit slow and the subtitles are hurried, but the movie picks us pace within the first 10 minutes. In the end, you'll learn a bit about Israeli culture and a bit about youth in the military. This is one of those rare movies that will admit to the frailty of life and shows that young people are doing the fighting (not men in their forties). I'll have to disagree with Jagger's assessment - an American movie this isn't. But that's totally a good thing."
5,Beautiful and Thought-Provoking,"Not a typical piece of lighthearted schlock. Remarkably well-done. The film sparsely depicts stolen moments of love amid stark circumstances. While it plays in just over an hour, it leaves an enduring impression."
3,Bitter Sweet,"This was a very good indie-film. They did great things with a low budget, and the acting is better than one expects from a gay independant film. It has a very good point to make, and if you're not careful, you might impale yourself on it. Personally, I could not watch this movie again, for it reminded me of the harsh reality of Gays in the military and Gays in society in general. I am glad that this film is in existence, it brings some touchy topics right up to stare you in the face. At once a documentary, drama, and romance."
3,Somewhat amtateurish in feel but ultimately a good flick.,"This is not a big budget blockbuster, and in fact the movie feels like a film student's senior thesis. Some acting is awkward and some situations seem ""forced."" (I find it hard to believe that Jagger would be so carelessly campy within a brutal military context. His behavior seems either foolish or self-destructive.) But overlooking these minor faults, the movie does make a good point about seizing the opportunity for uninhibited love while one can. Yossi's reflections on this point at the end of the film are poignant even while silent."
2,Fantasy Land,"Although well directed with decent acting, the story has more focus on day-to-day military life than a relationship between Yossi and Jagger. The dialogue between the two main characters just doesn't seem to mature - nor does their physical interaction.The ""title"" characters have a few warm moments, nothing more, nothing less. The film provides subtle insight on gay relationships in the military but seems to lack depth and emotion in the script - unless you fantasize about military lifestyle."
2,Cop-out ending!,"Was a reasonably interesting drama which crashed to the ground with an ending that resulted from some sort of ""deus ex machina"" to avoid developing the characters and the plot further. Had real possibiliies for grapling with some heavy duty issues with gays in the military, etc. Disappointing that the filmaker didn't go further."
1,Missing everything,"Although it's classic, filming a forbidden gay relationship that ends with a tragedy wouldn't necessarily make a movie a good one. This movie has bad acting and no story whatsoever other than the relationship. The audience wouldn't even know why they were in love, all we knew is that they had a relationship, and that's the story. The emotions were not surfaced even in the worst times. ( Not to be a spoiler, but at the end of the movie, it felt like nothing major happened and the other guy did not change his acting much. )"
4,Moving and Beautiful,While the production quality is not the absolute greatest it is a really good movie. A very moving story. Why are there so many tragic GLBT love stories? Can we have a happy ending please? Ha
3,needed more!,good movie but needed more character developement for me to feel more for them. Good movie though too short to get sucked in like we could have
5,- Great Film -,"There just are not enough ""Gay"" films, such as this one, that absolutely has you reevaluating not only who you are, but what is important in life. This Film is absolutely inspiring! Yes - Low Budget and unless you are fluent in Hebrew you will have to read subtitles, however this should not detour you from buying this film, it truly was a thought provoking film and shows how a good movie is one of story telling not artistic gobbledygook..."
5,Yossi and Jagger,"A beautiful sensitive story that digs into your heart. I just love films from Israel as they seem to capture the basic essence of every day life. Simple yet deep with emotions and color. Soundtrack to this film is amazing, Ivri Leder is one of my fav. Israel singers. See this film and love the story and feel the charactures. Great."
4,Surprisingly moving,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this Israeli film about the love between two male soldiers, and I was pleasantly surprised by the humor and surprisingly moved by the clandestine love between uptight Yossi and the more free-spirited Jagger (called that because he looks and acts like a rock star).The movie is fairly short--maybe a little over an hour--but it packs a lot in a that short time."
1,Don't waste your time,"This was an awful movie in all respects. Bad acting, simple and boring plot, etc. It comes off as very amateurish. You aren't drawn into the story at all, and by the end you'll feel robbed of your time."
5,Works in my Kodak digital camera,"I'm new at this stuff. I read the review that said it's a gigabyte, buy it! and I still had no idea if I needed this. I bought it because it is by far the cheapest on any website and I put it in my camera. It is tiny. It's about the size of a fingertip so be gentle with it and don't touch the metal ""teeth"" at the bottom. Put that part in first and click it in place.I can take more photos than I need and I know I can take lots of video. As long as it's under a gigabyte. I can download onto my computer and it won't delete until I tell it to.A good investment. I just leave it in my camera as its second brain."
5,It is what it is....,What;s to say? It's a chip and it works. Couldn't touch the price any wher else.
3,Digital Card,This card captured great pictures but it could not be used in the instant photo or DVD maker at three different machines. I was able to use in at the one-hour print shop.
3,Lite Entertainment,Nice period piece but the aside commentary was distracting and not necessary. The movie did not capture the real depth of this amazing woman's life. Perhaps next time.
3,dvd on the 1800's,the DVD was done well. It was depressing but I assume accurate. Lifestyles are sure different.
4,period dramas,I bought this particular video because it was a period piece. It was not exactly what I expected but I did enjoy it enough to decide to keep it and watch it again. It does tell an intriguing story in a very gentle way.
2,The Secret Life of the British Housewife,"""The Secret Life of Mrs. Beeton"" is a rather drab period piece about the woman who started lifestyle magazines. While there are moguls now like Rachael Ray and Martha Stewart, Isabella Beeton started it all. Defying Victorian conventions, she got into her husband's publishing business. When many upper-class women left housekeeping to their servants, Mrs. Beeton taught women how to keep house. (When conservatives talk about ""traditional""gender roles, they might only date back to the Victorian Age/Industrial Revolution,and it depended on social class)""Secret Life"" is historically accurate, but it's also incredibly stilted. There is more telling than showing, since Isabella has an annoying,near-constant voiceover. There's a scandalous secret in the center of the movie, which explains the heroine's numerous miscarriages, and her husband's sickliness. Still, it doesn't give any life to the series. ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is more thrilling."
4,"The story behind ""Mrs Beeton"" the brand.","This film offers a vary approachable interpretation of Kathryn Hughes biography of The Secret Life of Isabella Beeton. The point of the story is not ""Mrs Beeton"" the brand, or cookery book author - so don't buy this if you're looking for strong Victorian food references, but do watch it for an insight into the changing expectations of middle class England, and a very good 'behind the scenes' story of the infamous tome the Beetons' created. JN"
2,Don't waste your money,"A complete waste of time and money. I ordered this in my quest to obtain more period movies. I found it to have no redeeming features.If you are a Jane Austin fan, you won't like this one."
3,very good but...,"the book is great, very well written. and many people were waiting for the firstrigorous text providing the reader with a global view of the subject.there's just a problem of bad timing: due to the fast rate at which radically new results appeared recently and will keep appearing in the next several months, the book is already old before hitting the market."
4,Simple secure case,"I bought this after my 2nd plastic cover broke off my Palm Pilot - in order to protect it in my purse. It serves the purpose, but is a little fatter than I would have preferred. The zipper was quite difficult to use at first but has now loosened up. Overall, it's a pretty good item for the price."
5,I loooooooved this tape,I discovered this in about 1990 though it had been out for several years. I was 7 and couldn't get enough of barbie and this video was so great. I loved all the music and the performances the best. It was like a cartoon musical or something. I also loved how they travelled to outer space to perform and all the clothes barbie wore.
2,Barbie and the Rocker's Vol 1. Sucks!,Okay I was born in 1987 so I try to watch stuff from 1987 and beyond that point as far as television goes. But I rented this from the library and this movie really suck's and to be quite frank I'm a big Barbie fan and was just really disappointed with this movie yeah I know it's a 1987 film but they could have done so much more with this movie plus it's only 26 minutes long. I'm so glad I did not actually buy this movie and rented it first. Be smart rent this Barbie movie first then decide if you like it or not it's your choice whether or not to buy it. I would recommend if you like cheap entertainment then by all mean's go out and buy this movie.
3,Surprised....,"I was surprised to find that I had received a cassette tape, as I was expecting a CD! The tape was in good shape and it came quickly, now I will have to find a tape player to listen to it!"
2,Film-School Projects Show Their Age,"The films in Boys Shorts are, to be blunt, boring. I found myself fast forwarding looking for the next bit of dialog or human interaction. A few of these directors have fallen into the arrogant trap of believing that their work is so good that it needs neither plot nor momentum. It's not.My advice is to leave these shorts to their owners. They are from the early 90s, and feel even older. They will never become classics. They feel like film school projects. Several of them might well garner an A from the teacher, but none are worth public exhibition. Save your money."
4,Aromtatics Elixir by Clinique,I would recommend this product.Good price and in packed a box.Too bad that the gift wrap option was not available - it would have won another star!
3,Article OK but too expensive tax,Article is OKFast delivery made by DHLBut too expensive tax because the expenses of delivery are not mentioned on the document of import and DHL applies taxes to an amount very upper to that paidBest regards
2,poor recording,"THE PERFORMANCE BY THE pHILHARMONIA on this CD is great.However, I was disappointed by two things mainly:1. The recording quality is not satisfactory. Specifically, the strings sound artificial and the overall sound is conjested. Something must be wrong.2. The CD does not have any titles or album name or anything. This meas a nightmare if you are playing it on a computer or want to convert to mp3. You have to manually type everything.I am certainly looking for a different recording of this piece, not from virgin !!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This is a horrible CD! I bought this thinking a Russian Pletnev will do some justice by recording all of Tchaikovsky's pieces for orchestra and solo piano... NO! Pletnv was was very play in all recordings. There are too many surprising changes in tempo and dynamics as if he was playing Rachmaninoff. Pletnev did not portrait Tchaikovsky the right way. To my own opinion, Pletnev had ruined these Tckaikovsky pieces. He should be ashamed of himself for being a Russian and a pianist."
5,CONCERTO NO.2 NOT THE SILOTI EDITION,"The Concerto No.2 is NOT the bowdlerized Siloti edition--not only does the label clearly state that the original edition is played, but the violin and cello solos removed from the Siloti edition are clearly audible to anyone who has really listened to this recording. I don't even LIKE Concerto No.1, and this performance bowled me over--highly recommeded--and, at this price, an absolute STEAL!"
3,Cookbook,It's a good cookbook but I am looking for a begginers guide to grilling for my husband so I can hand off the golden tongs!!
2,Don't bother,I didn't find this book very useful at all. The recipes are very ordinary and not all that appetising. I wouldn't bother buying it. I would rather have a grill book written by Bobby Flay.
3,"More ""real time"" perspective needed.","Martin's book provides an entry level overview of the complexities required to make a transition from conventional therapy to the more ""bottom line"" world of business. Martin illustrates the application of traditional therapy based skills but provides only a cursory view of real-time business issues - particularly as those issues apply to firms of more moderate size. There are also several instances in which Ms. Martin utilizes scenarios in which there appears to be clear ""client/therapist - consultant/therapist"" conflicts. Yet, she offers no hint of how these issues are addressed or resolved.Martin's book is enjoyable introductory reading that needs to provide more substance if it is to have significant impact."
3,Very Small,Some useful hints there are much better lean books out there. This book will fit in your back pocket which was surprising to me. All in all not reccommended.
3,a reminder of what yuou know,"A good memory reminder for things you already have to know... Small, pocket size... Fonts are really small, but in such a small book, it is quite mandatory!"
4,If you own a Bristle Board you should own this!,"This is a great compliment to any bristle board. It has a ton of games and is easy to operate. I have the same minor complaints as some other reviewers; that the player announcer sometimes comes on when you're already in your throwing motion and that what everyone hit in cricket is not visible if you're playing with more than 2 players. However, I love 501 and 301 and this is an easy and convenient way to keep score for that. Well worth the money! Another plus is that you can plug it into the wall so you don't have to waste money on batteries."
2,Not all the versions from TV show,I was disappointed that the cuts were not the same version used in the program. A number of the cuts were by other performers than the ones used in the TV show. I was looking for the voice of Janis Kelly.
2,Food to live by,"I expected this cookbook to use honey, maple syrup, or molasses to replace sugar in recipes. I also expected substitutions of whole wheat flour, spelt flour, etc. for white flour. I was disappointed. Otherwise it's a nice cookbook."
3,Not too impressed,"My family bought me this book a few years ago when I was vegan- I think they must have just assumed it was a vegan cookbook. Anyway, it sat on my shelf for a while until I recently decided to start using it.The recipes are easy to understand, and the pictures of the food are great, but the ratios seem off to me. I made the fruit crumble and the ratatouille and in both cases the vegetable/fruit part seemed to overwhelm the rest of the dish: the crumble part of the fruit crumble should have been doubled, and the veggie part of the ratatouille made enough for *at least* twice as much pasta.The various ingredient dictionary is nice, and now that I know I need to doctor the fruit crumble recipe, I'll probably make it again, but this book will certainly not become a kitchen staple, no would I encourage people to go out of their way to obtain a copy. If it magically appears in your possession however, don't take the recipes too literally."
4,real food!,"This cookbook is not a "" health food"" cookbook per se, but focuses on whole and natural foods, including meat. The book is attractively designed and nicely illustrated with photos, there are helpful hints throughout, and the recipes are well laid out and easy to follow. I have made several recipes so far and all turned out good to excellent, and I intend to make the majority of the recipes in this book. My only criticism is that I wish more of the photographs related to the preparation of the recipes. Photos of fields, bunches of flowers, etc are pretty, but don't help with the recipes. Also, I wasn't interested in all the information about the Earthbound Farm company, but others may feel that this makes the book stand out from others."
5,Eat This Book!,"""Food to Live By"" is one of this amateur cook's favorites -- not just pretty to look at, but an interesting read and a valuable resource, with excellent background and genuinely helpful shopping information. I'm an ""unconfident"" cook, but these recipes are readily accessible even for me. And they taste wonderful. Thanks to Ms. Goodman for inspiring us all discover how truly good fresh food can be. Eat this book!"
2,Not As Good As I Expected,"I expected MORE from Earthbound Farms. This cookbook was nothing special. The recipes are mediocre and short in number. I expected more emphasis on the FRUITS and VEGGIES. I felt it was overpriced for what it contained. It might be good for ""beginners"", but contains little for real produce lovers! Also, I thought it would contain more vegetarian recipes. This had nothing more than any other good general cookbook. There are better cookbooks out there. Pass on this one!"
4,Great strength training workout,"This is an excellent workout using tubing as resistance. The tubing is not necessary and there are others in the video to follow for non-tubing modifications.The workout is quick, 30 minutes, and the time goes by fast. If you are looking for something to bump up your Turbo Jam experience, this is it. The more muscle contraction/squeezing you do while performing the exercises, the better results you will see."
2,A little disappointed,"I really LOVE Turbo Jam and I wanted to love this workout. However, I found this one to go against all of the things I really love about the Turbo Jam franchise: great music, fun moves and exercises that really work my muscles. This video, in my humble opinion, was boring and I felt that the bands didn't give me anywhere near the upper body workout I could've gotten using weights, such as in Turbo Sculpt. I'd recommend either Turbo Sculpt, Lower Body Jam (which is AWESOME for legs) or 10-Minute Solutions Sculpting instead."
2,Not what I expected,"I have done turbo jam before, but I didn't know there were other types of turbo jams. This one did not meet my expectations at all. I was looking for one that's energetic. Turbo jam 3T is not energetic enough, in my opinion, it is for beginners. mow i have found turbo jam cardio party mix 2, and am excited to use it! I am now waiting for it to come in the mail!"
4,Fat Shaker,"I love the Turbo Jam series of workouts!!! It's the type of exercise I need - cardiorific and not so irritating that I want to shoot my tv ') As far as this workout - it was not my favorite workout but was true to turbo jam style. If you're looking to add another workout to your turbo jam routine, I'd recommend it."
2,Not the right guide for baja,"Disappointing. I have used lp guides in latin america before with a great deal of satisfation and I understand that prices go up and things change. However the guide to Baja was not up to lp's usual quality. I think the research for the update was just not as thorough as it usually is for lp guides. The bus schedules were way off and didn't make sense. In the town of San Quintin there were three bus terminals and five bus companies with widely varying prices and none of that was mentioned in the book. Some ommisions and mistakes are to be expected in a guide book but in this one they occured far too frequently. In short, this guide is rarely valuable for a budget traveler, and if you are headed to Baja (which is by the way a beautiful place) I would look into other potentially more accurate guides."
5,Wish I'd found this long ago,This is the book I've needed for so long. I like that each lesson takes you several different books of the Bible to find answers to the questions. There is also a discussion section after the answer page to help you understand the meaning. I would recommend this to anyone at any level that wants to study the Bible.
5,Very Very Good Teaching Tool,"I use this book in group study. The book is beautiful and classy, text is large. The grading system is a little different but the subject matter is fresh and non-denominational. No prejudice in any one direction. Derek Prince's materials are always on point. It holds the attention and you can do it by yourself , a few or a large class."
3,Was not what I expected,"After reading all the wonderful reviews..I could not wait to get this book. BUT...it almost like a college workbook. Lots of questions, not alot of reading. I know that the author expects the BIBLE to be the textbook...and thats great. Its just not what I expected is all.Thanks,"
3,Not so great for me,"In the description it says this would be good for new believers or those who have known the Lord for awhile. I disagree. This book is purely fundamental. This would be the perfect self-study source for new believers or a bible study teacher who is teaching the fundamentals of the Christian faith. I haven't decided if I will use it to brush-up on my knowledge, or if I will save it to give to someone else. I'm still on the hunt for a more challenging and advanced self-study course."
2,book,This was an alright book not what I expected for learning... I have had a hard time finding something this was more memorization which I am not good at maybe I am to picky
1,Conservative point of view,I didn't like it because I didn't agree with the premises. A fundamentalist or evangelical would probably enjoy it.
5,Happy Buyer,My dad (who owns a lawn business) thought this was hilarious! Thanks for helping me with a great xmas gift and overall good laugh!
3,SF Giants Charm,The charm is a little on the small side but I guess I should have looked at it a little closer
3,Liked The Story But Had Trouble With The Book,"This is an interesting entry in the military techno-thriller genre. The story focuses on a high-intensity Asian land war in 2011. The conflict made sense at the strategic and tactical levels, at least most of the time. The combat scenarios were exciting and apparently honed with war gaming (Harpoon perhaps?). Black Rain gripped me firmly enough that I stayed up waaaay too late one night to finish it. Now the bad news. Mr. Malensek's got a great imagination but the book was pretty badly written. I winced at howlingly obvious spelling and word usage errors just about every page. Black Rain badly needed a decent editor. Hire a good one before the 3rd edition! IMHO, the book should lose the illustrations too. They're just grainy little thumbnails of generic DOD photos of troopers, ships and jets."
5,great stuff,I had long looked for a quick and easy way to get a little bit of caffeine. This is just what I've been wanting.
3,Not much caffeine (7mg),"Penguin doesn't actually list the amount of caffeine that's in the mints - they just say ""caffeine in 3 mints is equal to a 12oz cola beverage"". Of course, they don't specify which cola beverage, and the caffeine content in various cola beverages varies. According to EnergyFiend, the mints have 7mg of caffeine, which isn't anywhere near what you'd expect."
1,garbage,"this did not fit on my daughters violin for even a second. so disappointing because i think its a great idea. her violin teacher was stunned that it did not fit, and said she has had them work before. maybe it was the type of violin???"
5,Confirming Illinois' Assessment,"The reviewer from Shaumburg is absolutely correct in his or her review: the sound of these discs is magnificent and the organ, used in a few tracks, is very ""cool"" (if that word may be used). If you haven't heard the Pomp Marches in their entirety, here's a great way to do so; all are great compositions. And don't let the inexpensive cost deter you--the recording is luxurious and worth triple the price!"
1,This item dont work,"I bought this item thinking that it will sharpen my hook, but it end up just eating my tip without sharpening."
4,Makes a uniform sharp fine point,"For about 3 years I have been using the Berkley Pocket Hook Sharpener on jig heads and on size 4, 6 and 8 hooks, both single and treble. It puts a very sharp uniform point on them. I've used it for about 3 years and was so satisfied that I just purchased 2 more, one for the boat and one for a fishing friend."
3,Book,I chose this rating because i couldnt really understand what the point was. The colors were great and the pics. My son did have me read it twice and he is two. Either he liked it or thought he missed the point the first time around
1,Worst Air Conditioner on the planet,"I bought this last summer to use in a new home I purchased that has no air conditioning. It was crappy then it's crappy now. Tonight I had it going full blast and it said the ambient air temperature is between 76-78. The out door temperature is 81 or so. It has no use during the daytime heat so I don't even bother turning it on and luckily I'm out of the house. It's so loud it reminds me of those god awful noisy air conditioners in hotel rooms. I might as well go get a hotel room on the hottest nights because they cool the room better than this stupid thing. If you are moving it around to drain it or whatever it leaks EVERYWHERE!! My bedroom is only 300 sq ft. This air conditioner wouldn't cool a closet! Go check out the directions they are posted on Homedepot.com they are a total laugh. It says if it is too hot close the curtains or maybe their are too many people in the room! Yeah right, that's what's wrong with it."
1,Overpromises and underdelivers.,"I use this AC to cool my bedroom that's about 225 sq. ft. The manufacturer claims this unit is capable of cooling easily upto 250 sq. ft.I've been using this AC for a week. The air it puts out is definately cool but this AC cannot cool the room more than 2-3 degrees, yes, farenheit. It cools the room by a couple degrees in the first hour, after that I can't see any difference whether the AC is on or not.Well, ok, to be fair, the difference is that it does make noise and consume gobs of power without cooling anything."
3,still deciding,"When I purchased this about a month ago my skin was very dry with on & off flaking. I made one other change at the time I started using it - I quit using the hardwater at my house on my face and started using distilled bottled water. I think changing the water did more to fix the problem than using the serum, however when I slip and use tap water it does help releave the tightness. I also purchased the pomegranate lotion & enzyme mask a few weeks later. My T-zone started getting shiney and I started breaking out & getting clogged pores. I backed off to only using my Cetaphil cleanser and my skin seemed to clear up a bit after a week. I'm starting over again to try & figure out whether I need to return all of it or if I can use some of it. I should also mention I'm pregnant and hormones may have an impact, but I don't think that's the whole story. I'd say only purchase this if it's within your budget and make sure you can return it if it doesn't work."
3,Quite different than the book,"I watched A Place of Execution on Masterpiece because I had read and loved the book. For the most part, the movie version was well done. There was good casting and great performances throughout. Unfortunately, the script changed too many key elements from the book -- and these changes detracted rather than added to the story. I don't want to go into specific detail about these changes because I'd have to put in too many spoilers in order to describe them. You'll have to read the book and watch the movie for yourself to decide what you think. I suspect if I hadn't read the book first, I might have like the movie more. If you'd like to read my review of the book, it's under the Kindle version of the book (no spoilers)."
5,Mind blowing,"When you readThe Girl with the Dragon Tattooyou will find a reference to Val McDermid, author of the novel upon which this movie is based. Pay attention to that clue because it will tell you something important about the mind-blowing conclusion of superb BBC mystery.Shifting in time between the present and 1963 when a horrendous crime in a small village transfixed Britain, a television journalist (Juliet Stevenson) confronts the investigating detective whose dogged pursuit of the girl's stepfather propelled him into the national spotlight. Suddenly the detective clams up, after years of celebrity. Sensing a bigger story the reporter plows on. In doing so, she inadvertently stumbles on a powerful and personal truth.Great acting, intelligent direction, and deft editing make this tale riveting."
5,"good movie, not as good as book","The movie was very good, but I thought the book was much better. If i hadn't read the book i probably would have liked the movie better, but it just doesn't compare to the book."
3,"Cute, But Not One For the Collection","I was forced to buy this for my theatre class, so I was rudely pushed into reading it in a short amount of time and writing a hideous analysis. Though enjoyable, the price of $8.00 doesn't seem worth it to me. The paperback is really weak and easily bent and crushed to kingdom come. The story itself is corny and set in Georgian vernacular (which makes me cringe, but if you like it -- read this!). Not my favorite, but it's a decent play if you like Larry Shue. Unless it's your favorite thing ever, just get it at a second hand store. And if it happens to be your favorite thing ever, please spend extra and get a decent copy with a nice graphic on the cover or something."
5,one of the k's in kkk must be for komical!,"i'm currently in this show at my highschool, with the role of david, the evil but enigmatic preacher who marries catherine to get her inheritance to start a kkk band in southern georgia...and it's a comedy! seriously, the play is hilarious. all the characters take some good acting because all of them except owen change in some way or another. i'd suggest reading this play to anyone into theater, literature, or making fun of the kkk. :-)"
2,Interesting documentary with a poor conclusion.,"The first part of the documentary was interesting, especially the forensic work with tooth enamel, etc. The historical references were also insightful into that era of Roman Britain. Thus two stars were earned.However, the big problem was with their conclusion. They claimed to know exactly who the headless Romans were. Their chosen method of mystery-solving consisted of the following steps: 1) they looked at the skeletons and theorized about who they were 2) they read about an event that took place in Roman-British history around the same time and place that the skeletons were thought to be from and 3) they conjectured that the headless Romans were none other than the people in the historical event.That is very poor mystery-solving. It is an interesting and plausible theory, but the film makers should have clearly presented their idea as a theory, not a fact or a definite answer to the question of who the skeletons were."
3,The Creation of Independent Information....,"This is a short book reissued by the Princeton University Press 88 years after its original publication.Lippmann argues for information that is honest, not created out of dishonesty and untruth. In current day terms, Lippmann favors information without spin. He argues also for journalism and journalists to be professional, and for the information they dispense to be fact, not fiction.A fiery afterword by journalist and former White House adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, derides journalism and its failures during the White House administration of George W. Bush."
5,A wonderful look at all aspects of the Wright Design,"As a 13 year old Wright fanatic, i have read books all about different aspects of the Frank Lloyd Wright Design. One book for furniture, one for the house design, one for the glass, one for the Usonian concept. Upon opening this book I didn't expect to find anything different. Concentration in one area. What I actually received was a complete look at the Wright design. Instead of buying seperate books, I could find out all about Wright aspects in this one book! This book is a must have for any fan of Frank Lloyd Wright!"
3,Declining Quality,"I just ordered the Melissa and Doug Vehicle Chunky Puzzle.Last year my son received this puzzle and the Construction Puzzle for a gift. I love the wooden pieces. He not only does he love completing the puzzle, the pieces themselves are toys. It really is a special toy I plan to keep for my grandkids.I ordered a new set to decorate his dresser for his room. I am disappointed in the changes made to the product. The paint does not go all the way around the pieces and the paint on the front of the pieces is not the same quality. I feel this is no longer a stand out product for children, definitely not something I would keep for other children when my son is finished with it. I will settle for these on his dresser, although it will not look as nice as I hoped.I think of Melissa and Doug as a brand that is making wonderful, lasting toys for children. The quality for this product has definitely gone down."
2,Melissa and Doug quality has gone WAY down!,"This is my fourth chunky puzzle. One used, one as a gift a year ago, and two recent acquisitions including this one. On the older ones, the pieces are painted all around and the quality is wonderful. The used one is years old and still looks great. On the newer ones, as other reviewers said...just some cheap stick-on on the front, it is not painted on the sides or back. My son chews on them occasionally and it actually starts to come off. And what's worse, two pieces on this transportation puzzle are cut inaccurately and have to be practically crammed into the puzzle.Melissa and Doug should be ashamed of themselves...trading on their good name and reputation and slowly cheaping down their product, expecting us not to notice."
2,Not even close to what you used to get,"Although Amazon shipped this much quicker than I expected, it is not what was pictured nor what Melissa & Doug used to sale. I have a number of Melissa & Doug puzzles that are painted on ALL sides. The older puzzles are made of real wood and feel much nicer than this pressed board crap. They are also cut to the image where the newer puzzles are mere outlines, haphazardly thrown together. I would have promptly returned this puzzle, but my 19 month old son really loves puzzles and saw this and the other 2 puzzles as they were coming out of the box. I cannot believe that these cost the same amount or more than the other puzzles we own, yet they are of such an inferior quality that I cannot believe the are trying to pawn it off as the same thing they used to sale. Shame on you Melissa & Doug."
4,Perfect,"If you're buying Melissa & Doug puzzles these are the best, the big chunky pieces are perfect for the kids to hold. Just keep in mind, if you're trying to fit them in a ""Melissa & Doug"" puzzle holder, they don't fit b/c their pieces are so chunky."
3,Buy it if the price is a steal,"If you can pick this up for under $10, it might be worth it - BUT - do not expect it to be of the quality that Melissa & Doug seem to have been known for...I have a three year old and for years before I had my child everyone always raved about Melissa & Doug toys. However, it has been my experience that their wood is always chipped (totally splintered) and the paint is always chipping off. I did return one toy to the company because of paint chips and they were really nice about it and sent a different toy to replace it, so customer service is excellent.Maybe I just got (un) lucky. This puzzle is cute and my son loves to place the pieces in their spot - it is easy for him to do and the larger size of the pieces makes them perfect for small hands. I think this makes a nice toy for a 1-2 year old, it doesn't really hold my son's interest anymore. It isn't the kind of toy I would save for him, so probably I will give it away."
3,Quality,"Purchased this puzzle to replace a few pieces from an existing one I have and was suprised to see the quality is not what it once was. All the pieces are painted on every side however the biggest difference is that they no longer cut the detail around each piece. For example the Safari puzzle, the crocodile has spikes on its back. The old puzzle they cut out the detail allowing the spikes to show and the new puzzle does not. The board itself is half wood half particle board it appears. A little disappointing"
2,Such poor quality!,"What I have here is nothing like the one in the picture. The puzzles are cut to the outlines, not around the vehicles. Only painted (NOT handpainted) on one side. So disappointed."
4,"Fun Toy for Toddlers Learning ""Pretend""","I bought theMelissa & Doug Large Shapes Jumbo Puzzleas my kids first puzzle, and was pleased enough with Melissa & Doug to purchase this as a next step. My kids are 18-months-old, and they love to pretend with each little vehicle - waving the plane in the air, or making a ""woo-woo!"" sound for the fire engine. The ""wells"" that each piece fits into are fairly shallow, so my beginner puzzle-doers find it a little frustrating when the pieces slip out easily - but this is more a reflection of their puzzling skills than of the quality of the toy. I would definitely purchase more puzzles like this from Melissa and Doug."
5,A Lifechanging Read,"I have to admit, I was bit put off at the thought of two men writing a book about anger and women. However, I am sure glad I didn't let that stop me from buying this book. The authors of tackle this difficult subject with insight, compassion and sensitivity. They do not offer pat answers or a quick fix. This book is very well rounded. It deals with the why of anger as well as the how. It talks about hidden forms of anger. It also offers hope and lets the reader know that they are not alone. It also refutes many of the myths and lies about anger. This book also offers practical, useable solutions about how to identify and then overcome anger. I highly recommend this book to women of any age who are struggling with anger. Even if you are like me, and have struggled with anger for many years. I have read quite a few others books on anger and I have to say, this is one of the best.Another book on Anger that I highly recommend is Anger is a Choice by Tim LaHaye and Bob Phillips."
5,"All You Need To Know , Do it right, cook it right.","Thumbs up Vatch. A Great Book. Got to know when I borrowed you from our National Library. Reading through, I must add this spicy book to my present collection of recipe books. Systematic, structured with sharp colourful pictures enabling any novice cook to understand and prepare a meal with ease and confidence."
2,*~HoW tO BaBySiT~* (tHe CoMpLeTe GuIdE),"Audience: Teens, or adults who have never babysat.Purpose: To teach teens or adults how to babysit.Summary: It gives great tips on how to babysit children, how to entertain them, how to make them mind, and how to talk to the parents. It even goes as far as how much to charge per child, or the price for a misbehaving child. It also tells you what to do in case of an emergency. For example, I learned when a baby is choking, to hold them upside down and slap once between the shoulder blades. The book was written in 1990, the material is still very accuarate for the book to be 15 years old. The book gives great guidance, and should make anyone who plans on babysitting feel very confident.Kelsey N."
4,Very pleasant purchase.,I have to say that this book is an extremely enjoyable introduction to the art of landscape drawing. I would recommend it for those starting out.The explanations and examples are clear and concise. The exercises given are good and the introduction on what materials are required have been very helpful.
3,OK documentary.,"The main message in this video is good, even if it does not give more details about the facts he talks about.It should be good enough to motivate someone to at least give up on the junk food.I don`t agree with cutting off all the meat. Not all the meat has added hormones and blah blah blah.I buy organic fresh meat and is delicious & healthy.I cannot give it more than 3 stars because in a way this whole movie seems to be like a big add. Buy that and that....and you will have that & that result.Just keep it simple man, cut that junk from your diet, then add the real nutritious food & start exercising.And if you want to clear your mind from any stress - read the Bible & pray with hope (it`s much better & more effective than yoga)God blessed you with a beautiful body in the first place, you and I are the ones who messed it up & also we are the ones who need to fix it. YEP !!!"
3,Dull,I thought it was boring so I turned it off after a few minutes. I love watching documentaries about health etc.. But this one couldn't hold my attention. To be fair though I didn't watch the whole thing and it might have some good content. That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1.
2,Poor Production Quality,It says it was made in 2008 but it feels more like 1988. The production quality is pretty poor. It feels like a bad infomercial. No offense to the Gary Null but he's not a great actor. He's very melodramatic. The info isn't necessary bad though.
1,Kindle Weak,"As a kindle work this text must fail due to the lack of a working table of contents. It is a very large three volume collection of writings of Isaac D'Israeli and as such is not practically workable in electronic format without a working table of contents. The inclusion of page numbers in a format that does not reproduce page numbers is not useful. Admittedly I paid only 99 cents for the book and one gets what one pays for. However, I would rather had have a more expensive format that would have allowed me to enjoy this respected author fully."
2,muddled writing mess,"I must be reading a different book that those who have commented. I am on Chapter 7, having picked up and put down this book numerous times trying to make sense of the story. It is so convoluted and muddled that it's difficult to know what is happening, what has happened, and what will happen. I'm going to finish this book if it's that last thing I do, but I would not recommend it unless you like trying to sort out what's going on with these mixed up crazy characters and equally mixed up crazy plot."
5,Excellent Wire,"This wire is the best for your buck. They are generous at Phoenix Gold, I had 100+ feet in both spools."
2,"a boring, confusing, dud","i'm only on page 150, but this book already has had more non-sequitors and confused events than I can count. At this point, I will move on to something else."
1,Give this one a funeral,"Stephen Cannell may have provided the story line for The Viking Funeral, but he should read his book and think about taking it off the market. It's bad writing from page 1. I continued reading to look for something of value, but found nothing. I have never in my long life encountered a 15-year old boy who not only latched onto his previously unknown father but nagged him to replace his dead mother with a vulgar mouthed girlfriend. Scully's son is as unbelievable as the rest of the characters in this novel. What could have been a good plot was thrown together haphazardly and poorly written. Mr. Cannell should look up the word verisimilitude."
2,I GIVE UP!,"when i accidentally picked up THE TIN COLLECTORS and found myself unable to put it down, i had high hopes for its follower THE VIKING FUNERAL.i'm a lover of serial thrillers and was excited to suddenly begin to start a new one.but my serial stops at Book 2.THE VIKING FUNERAL is filled with so much of the same ol' threats and ""who cares?"" betrayal that it reads as if desperate to fill pages. The beginning and the previous book's excerpt was enough to hold a reader and encourage him to continue, but somewhere on page 200 i threw my hands in the air and tossed the book across the room.well, not so dramatically speaking but u get the idea. if u've read TIN COLLECTORS, keep the good impression of the series u have by NOT picking up it's follower.THE VIKING FUNERAL could be called THE SERIES FUNERAL."
2,Not Worth Your Time,"I purchased the audio book, read by Dick Hill. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star was because I listened to the whole thing. I kept holding on to hopes it would improve. It did not. My wife and I listened to this while on a long road trip. Had there not been a dearth of radio stations available, I would not have suffered through this drivel. I have read other books by Stephen Cannel, and compared to his television work, found them disappointing as a whole. The Viking Funeral is among the worst. I think this was due, in some part, to the reader, Dick Hill, but the plot and writing style were barely tolerable. If you enjoy mysteries, pass this by. Go re-read something by Robert B. Parker, etc."
2,Mediocre Storyline,"The concept of the book is interesting, and the writing is at times compelling. But taken on the whole, the book merits a so-so rating. Read something better if you can find it -- and there are plenty -- read this one if you can't find anything good."
4,Money Laundering 101,"While cruising the freeway Shane Scully sees his former LAPD partner and friend, Jody Dean in the lane next to him. He is shocked; Jody committed suicide two years ago.So the detective sets out to prove that Dean is alive, only to fall in with a crew of undercover cops who've slipped their pasts and are now running a convoluted money-laundering scheme that ties U.S. tobacco shipments to South American drug barons.Steven J. Cannell, the creator of TV series such as The Rockford Files and Wiseguy, certainly knows how to choreograph an action scene. The tightly constructed tale is occasionally stilted, but never dull. The story is at his best when describing the friendship between the emotionally scarred Scully and the ego-maniacal Dean."
2,This one's a dud!,"I suppose it had to happen. Stephen Cannell finally wrote a book that failed miserably in living up to our expectations of his story telling ability. The story is plodding and difficult to stay with, although I did finish it just to see if it would get better. Alas, no.The central characters of Shane Scully and Alexa Hamilton fail to interest...the ""Vikings"" are an unbelieveable lot of misfits. The ""scheme"" that they are pursuing of making a killing, both literally and figuratively in the ""parallel market"" is hard to follow and equally difficult to believe.The bodies are stacking up like cord wood as you work your way through the book, but you find yourself not caring that much and just waiting for the quite predictable ending. I hope this is the last book of the ""Shane Scully genre and that Mr.Cannell can once again take us to more interesting scenarios in the future."
3,The Viking Funeral Stephen J. Cannell,"This softback book was in fair condition when it was received. Front cover torn and creased, but all pages were very readable."
3,make sure u want jel..not other products if u gonna buy it,"The good is just looks like what it looks on the picture..butI wanted to buy some agar and when i searched on google, it said that agar is made by alga. I dont know what the difference between jel and agar but when i receive the product, the ingredients is said to be modified corn starch...so i soon know its not the thing i wanted....That is the problem of amazon maybe...when i searched it..this just come into the result with really high rate..and i guess this should be good and didnt read it carefullyanyhow..as its not the fault of the seller, i wont return it and may try to learn some cooking for it...BTWIF U NEED ""AGAR"" ...THIS IS NOT WHAT U WANT"
5,"Get thee to a used-book store, go!","It's a shame this book is out of print, because it is one of the best I've seen at addressing the processes and products of writing at work. If you see one at a garage sale, on-line auction, or a colleague's office, get your hands on it! It's insightful, concise and fun to read, and following Sherry's advice will make you a better writer."
4,Throat coat,"Got this for my husband, who is always clearing his throat. The product definitely has helped and he likes the taste too."
3,Taste good....,Although the taste was leaps above most other vocal sprays...I did not notice much difference in how it helped the throat/chords.
3,OK PIRATE FILM,"Not bad for its type,typical Italian film from the 60""sPan & Scan ,Fair ColorNice Transfer from Sinister Cinema.Pity its not in Widescreen,that would have made all the differance"
3,smaller than I imagined,I guess I didnt really think about how small the books would be..but they are good quality and the stories of Madeline are priceless
2,subtitle: The Hidden Struggle for Strategic Defense,"I have a hardcover 1988 copy of The Shield of Faith, 464 pages of text, and I keep it in a closet after it was withdrawn from a public library. The information seemed to be basic, but I am far more concerned about the human aspects of crimes against humor. 1988 was 43 years after global superpower squatting over Nagasaki with a mushroom cloud established that most strategic thinking would depend on the kind of tactics used in Fallujah after the American invasion of Iraq had not been entirely successful in that area. At the end of this book transparently pseudoverification was ballyhooed. ""There was more talk . . . and no money."" (p. 442).In the epilogue, The Defense Discombobulated. That follows a discussion of the topic The Bishops Crack in Chapter VII."
2,Strategies Left Me Wondering,"Banks, continuing to write about multicultural education and studies with this book, hit a wall! Concepts covered in the book were basic to the point of a lack of given information. I did not find this book comprehensive for the information I was looking for, I needed to do further research on the topic I was interested in! Not a helpful source in my eyes!"
3,LSD History Video looks slapped together,"This video history of LSD (made for A&E) has a promising premise, but it falls into the trap of many videos produced for TV: it's written as if they found the video footage first, then tried to contruct a story around it, rather than write a story and find the necessary video foorage to accompany it.They mention the tremendous impact LSD had with regards to the 60's counter culture revolution, but fail to explore this subject meaningfully."
1,The apology is warranted,"If the first few pages of the sample aren't enough to make you believe that this book is not usable as an electronic reference, then go ahead and spend the buck. My hunch is that you won't be using it very easily or very much. The OCR is uncorrected and the text is filled with garbage characters that make it impossible to search, much less to use as a Kindle dictionary."
5,A nicely crafted novel of the American 50's,"Seasons Of Forgetting is a nicely crafted novel of the American 50's, before changes in society forever relaxed and broadened people's attitudes toward the nature of love. Seasons of Forgetting is a story of forbidden love with profound consequences through two decades, emotional, impacting, and unforgettable. Jeanne Howard's debut effort as a novelist, Seasons Of Forgetting shows her to have a genuine gift for entertaining and involved storytelling."
5,Little Marines Score Big,"This is probably the greatest movie ever made. It all takes place in a small redneck community where two groups of kids are battling for the the Saline County Decatholon. A midget named ""BAD"" tries to spoil the competition by getting the town to bet illegally against the competition. The big winner is Billy who struggles to overcome a mysterious knee injury as well as ""The Captain"" who tells a lovely and inspiring story that involves treating people with respect, friendship, and bravey. Also, Greg learns the values of the boombox and how to socialize with the young ladies. Best movie ever next to ""Point Break."""
1,very poor anthology,"I was led to believe that these were full-lenght recordings.I was very disappointed to find that most (if not all) songs had the ends chopped off and replaced by some funky intro to the next cut.The selections are good, but the music quality only fair - not original recordings.Sorry, but in my opinion, not worth the money."
1,Pump it up,"Not enough volume to make this really a useful device. Although it is nice looking, and does not need batteries, the latter also proves to be its downfall, as any ambient noise in the room drowns out the output of the speakers. Not recommended."
1,Not even good for audiobooks,"I bought this with listening to audiobooks in mind. Even for this purpose, the unit is too quiet on most audiobooks, and where an audiobook is recorded hot (louder than normal), it distorts before a listenable volume unless it's just 18"" or so from my ear.It's a nice concept, but you really need a battery-boosted unit, or a set of cheap powered PC speakers if you want to listen on the cheap."
1,this dosent work!!!,i bought it and i was so excited and when i tried it on my ipod you could hardly hear the song! the volume is SO low and it really isnts worth it
2,I can barely hear anything!,"Even if you turn up the volume all the way up, it's really hard to hear! I have no idea how the Tacoma, Washington reviewer can hear anything while exercising."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a $10 speaker & this is exactly what you get. You can barely hear the music. It is probably a good speaker for your iPod if you work in cubicle hell, as you probably couldn't annoy your neighbors by your musical taste if you wanted to with this."
1,garbage,"doesnt work, do not buy this! piece of crap...you have to move it around till it works and hold it there...waste of money"
5,Perfect as a personal listening device,"The Cta Digital Portable Dual Speaker is perfect as a personal listening device. They say it is for an ipod but works on must devices with an audio out jack for headphones. Yes, it is not loud, but those devices that amplify sound need batteries and this does not. Also, I purchased this to play on the beach when I come out and I am wet and don't want to plug in ear phones. It is not too loud to disturb anyone and it is loud enough for me to hear while it is next to me. Perfect tool for the job."
1,Well Built But Weak Sound,"This is a great idea, but this unit isn't very loud. Returning it to try another type. You get what you pay for..."
3,Limited purpose,"Like another reviewer said, this speaker is best used for spoken voice, and maybe classical music, but not much else. This is mainly because the sound is extremely low and does not project any bass. However, it can be used to watch a movie with a friend in a very quiet room, but you'll even have a hard time hearing somebody with a deep voice because of the lack of bass. I also think that the price is a bit high, even with the discount on Amazon.Though, on the positive side, it requires no batteries, and is a nice portable size."
2,Painful - only drawback,"Ok, so they are cheap. Ok, they are also painful. I am just rolling my pantlegs up for now. It's not worth wearing these. I'll wear them in the winter though. I haven't tried any other metal cycling bands so maybe most are painful. I don't know. I would probably buy the soft kind (velcro or whatever) if I had it to do over again even though they are not as convenient for slipping on and off as these. Another benefit of these is that I won't be heartbroken if I lose them."
3,Appears to be no improvement over original flush valve,"I purchased the Mansfield toilet that came with this flush valve. The valve works great when everything is new. The problem is that the screw-on cap that stops the valve at the top of the flush is made of cheap plastic. The original cap cracked less than a year after purchase and eventually broke in 2.This replacement product appears to have the same cap, and I expect it to have the same problem. I had no luck in finding a replacement cap, so I purchased this replacement valve for the cap and the bottom stopper gasket."
3,Good replacement but leaks after a few months,When I installed these for my tanks I was amazed by the ease to install and usage. However now after two months of usage I will have to find a replacement for it's lead as it has started to waste water. Maybe I didn't do something correct but I followed whatever was written in the instructions...
1,Beware flatware marks these plates,"I've owned the colorwave set for a couple years now. Flatware leaves gray marks all over these plates. After contacting Noritake, they told me to use Bar Keeper's Friend to clean the plates (which takes a while b/c you must make a paste and let it sit on there and then clean it by hand). You must do this after each time you use the plates. They told me that in order to remedy this situation I needed to buy 18/0 flatware b/c it doesn't contain any nickel. I'm currently using nice 18/8 oneida flatware which is nicer than 18/0 flatware. Why must I go buy bottom of the barrel flatware to use with these plates?! In summary, if you want to buy any Colorwave plates, prepare to either a) have ugly gray-marked plates on your table b) spend at least 30 minutes every day specially cleaning your plates or c) buy cheap flatware and hope that works. All of the above: Not so appealing."
2,chips too easily,"My husband and I had this set on our registry Sept. of 2010. I regret to say that out of our 14 place settings that 6 of my pieces have gotten dime to quarter size chips on the edges of them. We have a new dishwasher, so I assumed the dishes would be safe for cleaning in there. I've thrown out two pieces because the defects are so bad. Bottom line, I would not recommend this dinnerware in regards to it's durability. It's very pricey and very fragile. I regret getting rid of my old Mikasa set now that lasted 10 years with very few marks. We have both green and blue sets and they seem to both be chipping too easily. I just thought everyone should know."
5,A splendid complement to good cooking.,"I received this book as a gift several years ago and it has become one of my most frequently used cook books. This beautifully illustrated book with easy to follow directions provides the recipe for dressing up any dish. Modestly priced, it is a wonderful gift to give as well as to receive."
1,Terrible !,"I was expecting so much from this movie as it opened up, because it looked promising.But, it became bad and got even worse and worse as it went along.Terrible story, terrible direction, terrible plot, terrible acting, terrible, period.Why, oh why, does hollywood continue to make these kind of films and waste our time, I will never know."
2,Pretty bad,"This movie is so bad it's good. I'll admit it's kind of fun to watch because it's very campy but the story itself is ridiculous. Peter Coyote stars as a lunatic Army colonel who regularly forces his junior officers' wives to have clandestine sex with him in his own private bunker. Courtney Thorne Smith stars as the wife who has the guts to say no.The story has no basis in reality and shouldn't be taken seriously, but I'll admit it kind of has a trainwreck appeal."
3,Can't decide,"This book was a mixed bag for me. I bought it soley for the Entreri story, but ended up reading them all out of boredom. Elaine and RAS's stories are really the only ones that I liked enough to actually remember and read again."
5,Reality vs. Head in the Sand,"Beyond Ragoon, I believe, is a very accurate account of what is really going on in Myanmar or Burma. The International Community and most countries of the world choose to ignore the atrocities of Burma which have been going on for years. I have visited Burma 3 times and on two of those occasions was able to see first hand some of the effects of the Burmese attempt to abuse the Karens of Burma. The children are so affected by what has transpired from the constant threat of the Burmese Army entering their villages and spreading devastation. I believe this DVD depicts the true situation of what the Karens of Burma face day to day in their fight for survival and justice. Both the United Nations and the United States need to do much more in assisting the Karen population."
5,Well crafted,"Well crafted film by John Boorman. Haunting in some places, intense throughout. I was surprised at the strength of Patricia Arquette's performance. It is a cut above her previous work.Worth saving for a rainy day with no other distractions."
2,hmmmmmmm,"this movie seemed endless, predictable, tired. By about the mid point I became convinced, it's the perfect next project for MST3K. I love Arquette, Spaulding Grey, and Frances McDormand is the best, as always. The whole thing was just too contrived, over worked. Oy.Save yourself (and 116 minutes) for something a little more recent, leave this for the folks who saw it when it was new, and still feel sentimental about it."
5,Wonderful film!,"The movie is fantastic, very moving and also extremely exhilirating! The score (Hans Zimmer) is outstanding and really adds to the depth and Southeast Asian feel of the film. Although I do wish they would have a DVD version for the film, with interviews and possibly some historical information and all of the deleted scenes that didn't make the final cut."
4,"Intriguing, Thought provoking","At first, my internal review of the movie, moments after it ended, was to dismiss it as good, wonderful scenery, and good scores. Now, after having thought more deeply, I am moved by the content, as well as the acting. True, the scenery was beautiful, the music was excellent, and the actors dedicated. I found this movie not at all great, but none the less I cannot wait to watch it again. Something about this story demands your attention, even though this review was done in late 1999, and the movie was out in 1995."
5,Masterpiece Movie!,"Beyond Rangoon is a powerful story, it's been one of my favorites for years now. A landmark motion picture epic, based on the junta of Burma and the oppression of the people. Burma is currently known as Myanmar, and Rangoon is now Yangon. This movie is now more important than ever with the massacres and brutal murders of innocent monks and civilians who are protesting. An incredible motion picture masterpiece, an amazing musical score by Hans Zimmer and equally stunning cast. Please release this on DVD and HD DVD soon."
3,"Good but like any film, a bit Hollywood-like","I cried when I watched this film because it's about my country. They used some actors that were real Burmese so that's good...and some were not, but did attempt to speak the language, so it's great that they tried to make it as real as possible, given the circumstances. However, the story is based on the protagonist who is this Caucasian lady and her own existential crisis. The story of the country is almost kind of a backdrop for that. But they did go quite into what had happened (though not in depth). The acting is so-so, not just because most of the cast aren't real actors, but activists acting in the film, but it's also because the lead actress wasn't that great of an actress in this film (or any other I guess). Still, it's a good introduction to what happpened in Burma in 1988."
1,Not a good product,"I received it in good time but the item itself doesn't live up to my expectations. It doesn't heat up much, I can still touch it when it's on high, which is unusual for a hair iron. It now lives at the back of my drawer with the other useless things."
1,TOO AWKWARD!,"NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AT ALL. BULKY, HEAVY AND CLUMSY FEELING, UNABLE TO MANAGE IT. SENT IT BACK..."
4,hot curling brush,This is a good hot curling brush. I only wish it had an auto turn-off - you know how frazzled you can be in the morning! This brush works very well though - heats well and is easy to use.
4,Overall a Pretty Good Product,"Frankly, this is the only 1 1/2"" barrel curling brush on the market from what I could find, so it's lucky it's pretty good quality. The barrel heats up to a nice, but not hair-scorching temperature and it heats fairly quickly. The plastic tip stays cool enough to touch, so styling is simple and the bristles are close enough together to make curling even my baby-fine locks possible.The only major problem is what I consider a design flaw: the joint between the barrel and the handle isn't covered, which means if you're not extremely careful to keep your hair toward the tip of the barrel, it'll get caught--and it's painful. I invariably lose a few valuable strands a day, no matter how I try to prevent it."
2,THIS CURLING IRON DOES NOT GET HOT ENOUGH,THIS HELEN OF TROY CURLING IRON DOES NOT GET HOT ENOUGH. I WISH I NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED. I WILL CHECK INTO RETURNING BUT IF I CANNOT I AM STUCK WITH IT AND IT WILL GO IN THE BACK OF MY BATHROOM CLOSET. THIS IS WHY I DO NOT LIKE PURCHASING ON-LINE. IT IS SUCH A HASSLE TO RETURN. NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE THE CONAIR AND PAY AGAIN FOR SHIPPING. I WISH I COULD FIND THE CURLING BRUSH IN THE 1 1/4 INCH SIZE IN STORES. BUT I CANNOT.
3,Helen of Troy curling brush,"The other reviews I read are mostly accurate. The curler does not overheat (it keeps me from burning my hair...). The tip does overheat. My daughter and I bought this curler because you cannot find this size in retail stores (we have looked and looked), but we have to be very careful with the hot tip. It does not get as hot as the iron itself, but you cannot touch it for more that a second or two at a time if you don't want burned fingertips! My daughter and I have each had a Helen of Troy for some time and they have lasted through several years of daily usage. BUT...although we are keeping the Helen of Troys for back up, we are about to order another model we found from Conair---the same size but with a cool tip and auto shut off...two very desirable features!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"This product is flimsy to say the least. The handle is cheap plastic which feels like if you drop it once it will shatter into a thousand pieces. The power button is too loose so when you are trying to style your hair, it is too easy to push the button into the off position. The conair brush I had before was much sturdier and the settings button more rigid. Unfortunately it died after about 8 years of use...I doubt I will get 1 year with this brush."
2,"Helen of Troy 1 1/2"" Brush Curl Iron","The curl iron brush is reasonably priced. The tip didnt get hot on mine like some of the other reviews stated. The curling part doesnt get as hot as a professional curl iron would even though the product label says ""professional"" I feel you could have bought just as good a product at the local drug store and saved the shipping cost. I put it away as a backup and went to the beauty supply and purchased a real professional curl iron."
4,SMOOTHES BEAUTIFULY,"I HAVE VERY WAVY SLIGHTLY THICK HAIR, I LOVE THIS HOT BRUSH BECAUSE THE HOT BARREL SMOOTHES FRIZZ AND MAKES MY HAIR SHINY AND HEALTHY LOOKING. I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE A HAIR DRYER AS WELL, IT IS MORE LIKE A CURLING IRON, BUT I WAS NONE THE LESS PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS."
2,Tip too small to hold and does not hold hair in brush,"This tip is too small to hold and I burned myself this first time I used it. The brush tips are too far apart to hold your hair tight enough to wrap around and curl. It gets hot enough, but my hair won't stay wrapped in it. I only paid about $20 with shipping, but I should have went out to eat with that money, I would have gotten more for my money."
4,Curling Iron,This is a back-up to an identical one previously purchased. This model does not seem to be available in stores around our area. My wife likes this particular one over many others.John Loehlein
2,Not ideal for thicker hair,"I was really disappointed when i opened the box. The product does now have the ""solid"" feel of a good styling tool. Light is good - but this is too light.It took ages to heat up and just never go hot enough. I have been using Conair for years, and this just doesn't compare.The barrel is a great size and the ""teeth"" really gripped my hair, but it would just take me too long as it doesn't get nearly hot enough for my thick hair."
3,Mediocre,"I've been looking for a 1 1/2"" hot brush for some time; there used to be a fair selection but the Helen of Troy brush seems to be the only one available. It takes quite a while to heat to full capacity, more than 30 minutes, and that's not even very hot. Another downside is the static left behind.I've had this same problem with the smaller Helen of Troy hot brush (1 1/4"") but at least there are other brands from which to choose."
4,Helen of Troy Curling Iron: 1 1/2 inch review,"I use this curling iron on a daily basis and have found it works very well for styling large, smooth waves. I have not been able to find this size in any curling irons in stores in my area or any areas I have traveled to. It is not very expensive, easy to order, and works for years without any problems. The only aspect of this curling iron I would change would be to have a quicker heating time. It does take 3-4 or more minutes to heat up and I must remember to plug it in and turn it on a few minutes before I need to use it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money - Update,"I contacted Helen of Troy regarding the cooling tip defect and asked how to return the item. This was their response...Dear Valued Customer,You will receive a new unit in return. At the current time, the cool tip has not been re-designed.Thank you,Irene VillaHelen of TroyConsumer Service1-800-487-8769"
4,Love it,"Works great! The only negative thing is that it does not automatically shut off after a period of time. HOwever, the handle part is illuminated when it is on, so you have at least a visual indication that it is still on. I highly recommend it."
2,Takes for ever,It just take for ever to heat. And when it does is not too hot. If you have at least 1 hour to use the brush maybe ok for you otherwise better to look for another one.
4,Helen of Troy Brush Iron 1-1/2 Barrel,I really like this curling iron. It really controls frizz and helps make your hair super smooth. The only downfall is that the tip is not long enough. Be careful. I've burnt my thumb a few times since recieving the brush iron.
3,Hard to find size,This particular brush curling iron takes a long time to get hot and doesn't turn off automatically.
3,Not good for thick hair,"Unfortunately, it doesn't work on my thick hair, not hot enough :/I'll keep looking for a more powerful curling iron."
1,not what I had hoped for,"this product lacks in most areas; it does not get very hot, the on/off switch is in a bad location so as when you are trying to roll your hair around the brush, you inadvertently shut it off,it takes forever to heat up and then it is not at all hot enough to curl hair, no ""safe"" area to hold end of brush away from hot curling barrel (hot enough to burn your fingers, but not very hot to curl hair). I'm planning to return the item as soon as I find a replacement....any suggestions out there?"
3,Tip is too hot!,"This is the only curling brush I could find in the size I needed. Only problem is that the end is plastic, and gets too hot to touch. Makes it difficult to work with."
2,Not so Hot,"It never gets hot enough to affect my hair style at all. Also, the on/off switch turns off at the slightest bump or touch while styling. I am very disappointed because this is the only brush iron of this size I can find."
3,Does the job.,"I had a Conair curling brush that I loved but it broke and curling brushes, especially one that is 1 1/2 inch, are very difficult to find. I saw this one so I decided to order it. It's not the same quality as my Conair was. It's flimsier, only has a high and low setting but it does the job. The end does get very hot, so you have to be careful with that. But overall, it's not a bad curling brush."
5,"Thomas, we love you!","What a superb Christmas gift, in fact, what a gift for the entire year of 1999! News from Thomas Dolby! There's not much else I can say about a record I haven't even listened to, except that, whatever Thomas does,it sure is thrilling, to say the least."
2,Not a hit with our toddler,"We have a daughter who is 17 months and have yet to find the floatation device to hold her. She screams and cries before she ever makes it to the water in this one. We fought her on it to see if it worked and the product seemed to work just fine. Not a success with our daughter, but maybe for someone a bit less stubborn."
5,A terrific concert.,"Elton John is my favorite artist and if you're a fan of his, then you should definitely add this to your collection. Elton gives a brilliant 2-hour show in Barcelona, Spain to thousands of screaming fans. He performs many of his hits including: Daniel, Philadelphia Freedom, Tiny Dancer, The One, Sacrifice, and I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues. My favorite was The Last Song in which Elton gives a riveting performance. Buy this and you won't be disappointed. By the way, Elton's friend, the late-great Gianni Versace designed the costumes and lighting!"
5,Amazing performance,"Elton shows his mastery - at performing, at piano playing, and at songwriting. Great blend of old and new - with great extended versions of Mona Lisa's and Madhatters (parts I and II), and interestingly enough Sad Songs."
1,Elton Video is a big blur,This video is a complete disappointment for Elton. The video is shot in an open stadium where the acoustics are horrible and the lighting is too strong. Too many bugs are flying around and Elton's hairpiece looks like it's blowing off his head. Older concerts should be released where his voice was better and where he could hit the high notes. I suggest that The Elton John Central Park concert be viewed instead.
3,light,lighting is ok and good for a small room and for taking out pics. not for shooting or recording at clubs or out door.
1,it gets hot and it smokes,"Not worth it, I bought 3 and 2 smoked and stopped working. the third one I got rid of it because it smoked too.I need to find one that has an integrated fan so it has less chances of burning."
1,lighting is bad,lighting is bad for small room and for taking out dore pics. not good for shooting in cubs or out door and it smokes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Average product,"I have used it constantly for 5min (300w), switch stop working....in another instance I had to use it for more than 10 min, light itself stop working....have noticed, unit gets so hot....too dangerous to handle when kids around or video shoot with lot of people around...I dont recommend..."
4,"Great, but does have set backs","The light works perfectly for my video shoots, but it does smoke with the lens on. I would rate it perfect if the device didn't overheat the lens."
2,cameramen,"the light is good but we had a problem , I do not have the lightbulb part number , so I can not buy spare light bulb"
1,Came with the wrong bulb,"This vendor sent me the wrong bulb. I called in twice. They were nice on the phone, and sent me a replacement bulb, but it was still the wrong size. Then I couldn't get them on the phone so I ended up buying one locally. It wasn't cheap."
4,I'm Tee & Essing.....,"First off, if you're yearning for the rockin' duo's old acoustic sound, you won't find it on this album. Using many new instruments (sadly, more electric guitar than acoustic) makes for a different ""feel"" to an album, and 'If It Was You' is NOT what we're used to when it comes to Tegan and Sara.With that said, it's still a great album. It's fun. It's poppy. It's in your face. A little disappointing to fans who love their old sound (like myself), but still a great album.Album highlights would include: Monday, Monday, Monday, I Hear Noises, Living Room, And Darling, and Don't Confess.All in all, I'd suggest buying it, whether you're a fan of Tegan and Sara or not. It's just a FUN album, and we could all use a little fun now and then."
5,Most intriguing pop/folk duo in history,"Tegan and Sara seem to keep there fans on the edge of there seat with each new release. In my books, the two are at the top of all charts from pop to folk and are on a clean paved road to stardom. Keep up the good work ladies."
5,"WOW, music is cool","Today is Sunday. I heard about Tegan and Sara on Friday and I bought ""If It Was You"" yesterday. Now I am addicted. My favorite songs are ""Monday Monday Monday"", ""Not Tonight"" (especially), ""Living Room"" (even more especially), and ""And Darling (this thing that breaks my heart)"", which is a really sad song. I love the bango on ""Living Room"" which I am listening to right now. I am really excited about their new CD. Anyway, if you are not sure about this CD I think you should buy it. It is fairly cheap and you may be surprised by how good the music is when you listen to it. Plus the CD has cool extras.I hope Tegan and Sara will tour in Portland. Goodbye and enjoy."
5,A Great CD,"A little more dressed down than later releases, this is still an amazing cd. Was in my car stereo nonstop for years. Still is..."
2,what a waste,"They sound like screaming children and their accents are more annoying than Avril Lavigne's. Tegan and Sara have been recommended to me by too many people for me to think about, and continue to have respect for. Their lyrics really leave something to be desired, and everything else is just tired. There is nothing original about this album at all. If this is supposed to represent ""growth"" for them, they have failed completely. Their folky stuff wasn't great, but this is even worse."
5,super album,"this record is great. I had the pleasure of seeing Tegan and Sara live at the Vancouver Folk festival just a few months prior to the release of If It Was You. They played many of the songs off the album and i was hooked from that moment. What's amazing is that the album manages to capture the sheer feeling of light heartedness and joy that i felt when listening to them live.This album is a feel good album. Although there are a few songs that are somewhat slower, even they express an overall feeling that is upbeat. That's something refreshing amidst the sea of nu-metal and heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriters emerging nowadays that can only focus on the negative of life. Buy this album. It's splendid pop rock album in the fine tradition of the pretenders."
5,Love <3,This CD is amazing! great great great! any Tegan and Sara fan must have this!! Great to sing along to!
2,CHARGER DIDNT WORK,The headset worked but the charger did not work. It would not charge our l2 phones.
1,Didn't work.,I purchased this set strickly for the headset. I do not like using the wireless type and these are hard to find for my new phone. This particular headset did not work and I will be returning it.
3,"Great boots, but.....","Yes these are great boots for those of us who have bigger calves and need stretchy boots. They look like real suade and are very sexy, but since they zip up the back of the leg you have to be careful of your heel. My heel popped the zipper the 1st time I wore them. i was able to fix them and wear them again, but now I have to be careful with them. I was suprised being Anne Klein boots that they did this."
2,Sole of Boot not safe,Sole of boot was a slick manmade material making it easy to slip & fall. Should have had rubber with ridges to prevent this
3,Not the best test prep for Praxis,"I just took the Praxis test and I am now sorry that I wasted MANY hours studying much more math than necessary. The practice tests in this book are much more difficult than the actual test. The actual test requires knowledge of VERY simple algebra and geometry, yet this book emphasizes more difficult material. On a positive note, the review sections on writing skills were helpful, and both the drill sections and the practice tests in writing helped me strengthen my grammar skills. The book isn't bad, but I found a better study guide that more accurately reflects the skills required on the math section of the Praxis. This book isn't bad, just don't flip out when you take the first practice math test! It is probably not an accurate predictor of how you will do on the real test!"
3,Too Hard to understand,"I found this book difficult to understand, especially the math section. The reading and writing can help in some areas, but the math was very difficult. The section seem highly advanced math skills such as statistics. I am very discouraged with this book. Take my advice, look for another guide."
3,"Good For Reading and Writing, but Math very hard","This book does an excellent job of reviewing the important concepts associated with the writing and reading portions of the Praxis. However, I felt the math review did not accurately reflect the questions presented on the test. I scored very high on the reading and writing portions of the Praxis. This book could be a valuable study aid if its combined with another Praxis study guide that closely represents the actual math questions on the Praxis Test."
1,Extreemly Disapointed,I purchased this book at the advice of a bookstore represenative. I literally stressed myself with this book to the point that I caused myself to have an anxiety attack. I just took the praxis on Sat. Nov. 15th and the test was absolutely nonething like what you have in this book. I would not recomend this book to anyone try the cliffnotes version it's much more realistic.This Book was 100 times harder than the actual test.
2,A waste of money and time,"I purchased this book to help me prepare for the math portion of the Praxis I and I was extremely disappointed. The math review sections were full of complicated word problems and geometry problems. I could not figure out how to do the problems in the exercises based on the few examples that were given. The list of formulas was helpful but the formulas can be found in better Praxis preparation books. The sections on the reading and writing portions of the Praxis may be helpful to some people, but I did not concentrate on these since I felt confident about my abilities in these areas. I did take the Praxis and I passed all the parts including the math, which worried me the most. I discovered the Cliff's notes Praxis review book a few days before I took the test and I think it did a better job of helping to clear up some of my confusion on the math."
2,Unrealistically tough!,"I only used the math part of this book, and I found it very helpful until I got to the section on word and work problems. They only gave a couple of examples with solutions, and then only three ""drills"" with no explanations of the answers. The drills were so different and so much harder than the examples that I got very frustrated and started losing confidence until I read some of the other reviews on this book. They verified my experience. I haven't taken the test yet, but compared to the material in other study books I've used, this one is much harder. So I'd recommend the math review except for the last section I mentioned, and keep in mind that the questions seem to be much harder than ones you'll see on the test. If you get freaked out easily, you're better off using a different book! Leslie"
5,Just what I needed,"This test review book was exactly what I was looking for. I bought it used to save money and wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it looked like brand new, there was no abuse to the book, the pages were still crisp and there was very little writing/notes inside. I'm very happy with this purchase!"
2,It's Alright,"I really don't know why Angie decided to make her sophomore release completely different than her debut album that was so unique. This album has no searing guitars and rock beats that made 100 Million Eyeballs stand out. It's very electronic and and her voice seems very ""echoey"" in every track. I like some of the songs, but when I'm in the mood for miss angie, I always find myself going to 100 Million Eyeballs and not Triumphantine. I do LOVE 'Dancin' In My Head' and think it's the best track on the album."
2,"Neat, I guess.....","This is pretty neat, I guess....well, it's sorta weird. I mean, all the songs seem sung in the same whiney, outer-space kind of tune/voice. It's ok."
2,"Nice looks, design, features but.... ""Not so nice""","This 7 in 1 camera with it's really great design and advertised features, quality and performance I am yet to see out of this product. I tried fooling myself into accepting the quality. Everyone who has seen it loves it and I'm sure there are some of you that could live with and love it. My experience with it is as follows. The video recording is no better than an average digital still camera with video capability. The mic isn't bad on the audio recording. The still pictures are only slightly better than a cheap net cam. The flash is totally out of range or control, say 5 to 6 feet no closer or farther. The mp3 player is terrible. The voice record function is the only acceptable function. Far from a 4.1 megapixel advertised quality. MPEG-4 format out of this camera sucks. Overall, this is a decent quality camera for a kid to goof with and a waste of 100 bucks in my book. Put it towards a decent mini DV camera."
1,K'Nex Coaster not all thrills,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEN FOR MY 13 YEAR OLD FOR CHRISTMAS, SHE SPENT 2 DAYS BUILDING IT AND IT DIDN'T WORK. THE CHAIN WOULD NOT GO ON CORRECTLY AND THE PIECES WOULD NOT STAY TOGETHER. IF YOU ASK ME IT WAS A LOT OF TROUBLE AND A BIG PIECE OF JUNK THAT COST BIG BUCKS!!!! I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN K'NEX. WE HAVE THE FERRIS WHEEL AND IT WORK GREAT."
5,The perfect album,"Micky and the Motorcars is the most underrated red dirt band out there--this CD is an excellent example of why they should be right up there in popularity with CCR and RRB. The title track, ""Careless"" makes you want to belt every lyric; ""Remember"" is a hidden gem; ""Guts"" and ""Lost and Found"" round out the top four. There isn't a bad song--buy this album and you'll be an M&MC fan immediately."
5,A masterpiece!,"I just recently discovered The Berzerker and I have to say that I am blown away. I am a huge Nile fan and before listening to The Berzerker I thought no one came close to Nile in intensity, brutality and overall quality of music. If any band I have heard could come close its The Berzerker.I 100% recommend this album to anyone who likes fast brutal death. This has to be one of my favorite albums of all time!"
3,Not what I expected....,"As a metal fan I had to check these guys out after I saw they covered the Carcass track ""Corporal Jigsore Quandary"". How bad could this be since that's a classic 90's metal track from a great band? It was pretty bad. I think vocally and riff wise these guys are ok but the techno stuff and the drum machine just doesn't do it. Grindcore with a weak drum machine is just not my thing. I think the worst thing about these guys is the drums but I give them 3 out of 5 stars because they could be better."
3,First one's better,"There's no doubt that if you don't like extreme music then you'll hate this. It's basically an ear-raping journey into brutal, brutal music.This album is a slightly more traditional grind album than their first one, losing some of their trademark soundscapes and slower tempos. I'm only writing this review because it seemed that no one else that reviewed it had listened to their first album. In my opinion what made The Berzerker so original and interesting to listen to has faded into the background on this CD.Dissimulate is definitely good and heavier than almost any other album out there - it's just that if you want insanity, brutal vocals, heavily altered drums and an underlying eerie feeling then get the first album instead."
2,Could have been better,"The Berzerker is definitely an incredible band. Their debut album showed the music industry how extreme music can get. This album had the same extremeness of their first one, but not the heaviness. Their first album was very brutal and somewhat dark in a sense. This album was almost a punk-sounding kind of grindcore; It doesnt have the same ""death metal"" aspect to it. I bought this album first and thought it was pretty good, but then when I listened to their first album, it put this one to shame. I definitely think that The Berzerker should learn from their mistakes and make their next album more like their first. In conclusion, dont buy this one, buy their first album."
5,Worth every penny,"They fit and match any outfit. My son's been wearing his with various outfit since he was born. He's now nearly 4 months and they still fit. He get's tons of compliments. Get or gift these, you won't be sorry."
1,buyer beware,I have never received this product that I ordered more than an month ago. Three times this company sent me the wrong product. I returned all three and have asked that my money be refunded - I no longer have time to deal with their errors. I have still not received a refund oreven a response to my request.
1,Never got delivered. Was it even shipped?,"I never saw these products. They were allegedly shipped on August 15 due to arrive on August 20. By August 25 I wrote to find out what had happened. Amazon asked me to wait until August 31. Finally, I asked that the order be reshipped, and Amazon asked me to cancel and reorder. When I reordered, the product was listed as no longer available. Whatever?"
1,Wrong set sent,"I ordered the Loopies ""Sneaker Brights"" but instead received some musical theamed version. I was very disappointed.The box was labeled Sneaker Brights so I wrapped it up and went to a baby shower. When the expectant mother opened my gift I saw that there was a mix-up.Regards,Dee Biscamp"
3,Cute but Small,"My three month old will never fit into these in a month. They do run larger than the Trumpette brand and are great alternative to shoes, but he won't get much wear out of them for the price and wearing them to 12 months is a pipe dream. I wish they came in a larger size because he won't be walking for a long while."
2,Cute but....,"These are definately cute, but for the price, I expected something more. They are just baby socks, not extra warm, or anything like that. Just cute socks."
3,Not up to Expectations,"After reading the reviews here, I purchased this as a gift foy my lovely 19-year-old granddaughter. When I received it, I decided to read it first to see what it says, and I found it was not as wonderful as I expected from the previous reviews. I have not yet given it to Emily, but I look forward to hearing what she thinks of it."
2,"Beautifully crafted, inspiring encouraging literature","I also h ave a hard copy of the book, and recommend that one at least have a look at it in print. The book design, especially the iconic illustrations add a quality not to be missed."
5,Angelina ballerina Alice doll,"The product is adorable, and I just love it. The clothing is really cute, and it all seems to be a very good quality product."
4,"Just a bit disappointed, still a killer musician","I'm a 22 year old college student who is just starting to get into the late '60s/early '70s music.I was watching the WB video of Woodstock, and Joe Cocker had an incredibly amazing performance of ""With a Little Help From My Friends!"" I rewound it and watched it four times. So I decided I must buy one of his albums. I was looking for a greatest hits type of cd focused more on his earlier stuff.I knew that there was really no chance that a studio performance could match the performance he gave at Woodstock, but I gave it a try anyway. If I close my eyes and try very hard, I can actually see the energy pusling from Joe's body when I listen to this cd. But as I said, I think my expectations were just a bit too high.Still, if you are looking for a soulfull and gritty vocalist, close your eyes and hear what Joe Cocker can do.(Reminded me quite a bit of Jonny Lang if you are looking for a modern comparison)"
1,Low quality junk...doesn't last,"Over the past 2 years, I have purchased 4 different T3 blowdryers. I only dry my hair every other day and was expecting a much longer lifespan for this time of money. It did dry my hair quickly and left if shiny, so I kept returning to buy new ones when the prior would break down. This is ridiculous though! I'm done with t3... Off to find a higher quality product that will last more than 6 months!!"
1,T3 Tourmaline 83808,"After one week this brand new hair dryer stopped working on low, which is the speed I always use. How can I get it replaced without a hassel? I really like this dryer when it is working properly."
1,do not recommend,I had the T3 hairdryer for less than 4 weeks and it completely stopped working. This is my second T3 hairdryer. My first one lasted two years. It is disappointing since this was top rated in many magazines.
2,Hair Dryer,"First of all, this is the second hair dryer that I received from you and this one is not any better. I believe you are selling inferior or refurbished products. If that is the case, you have no right to sell a product that is coming off as brand new. Tourmaline refused to warranty this product because the tag that is attached to the cord indicating the bar code is missing. It was missing on the other hair dryer also. I now spent $129 on a dryer that hopefully won't break and if it does, it needs to be thrown out. I purchased as a gift for my daughter the ""original"" and spent the $180 for it. I know that is authentic and it dries the hair without any frizz. I can't say the same for this. I find this a tremendous disappointment and will never purchase from amazon.com again. I am appalled that you are passing old equipment as new."
2,Could not register for warranty,"When I tried to register the item for warranty, I received a responce from manufacturer that they could not give me warranty because I purchased the item from uncertified seller (i.e. amazon.com). Also, there was no tag with a serial number on the cord, as it was indicated in a note about warranty."
1,T3 Tourmaline Professional Featherweight Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer,"BUYER BEWARE !!!Be sure to purchase this dryer from the AUTHORIZED DEALER ONLY. This product might be a bit more expensive however it will save you hours of headaches and many dollars if you need to return the dryer within what you THINK is the warrentee period. Only the authorized dealer will stand by the 48 month warrentee. The dryer I purchased from Amazon broke before one year of use , it was NOT from an AUTHORIZED DEALER. I had a extremely hard time getting it replacemented. I was shuffeled back and forth between Amazon and the seller that provided Amazon the dryer; Glamor Beauty . After many heated hours on the phone with both parties, Amazon did send me what I think is a new dryer. It is not from an authorized dealer so I'm not sure how long this one will last."
1,WHAT A WASTE!,"This blowdryer is not worth the money! I bought it less than a year ago and not only is the claim ""cut your blowdrying time in half"" a lie, (it takes me 1 hr and 15 minutes to blowdry my hair), lately it has been blowing out cold air all of a sudden in the middle of my blowdrying session. Also, if you don't purchase from an ""authorized dealer"" your warranty will not be honored. The t3 bespoke labs people don't even have an official website! This is a farce! Don't waste your time and money."
2,not worth the money,i bought this for my wife. she thought that it would be better than her $20 hair dryer. she got it used it and put it up and went back using her $20 dryer. it says it cuts down on frezze but it made her hair more frezzy. so save your money and just by a cheaper one it will work the same or better.
4,"good, but there is better","I must say the price is quite reasonable for a hair dryer using crushed tourmalines to produce tourmaline ions. But I have rather fincky hair. They only like saphire ions. I much prefer the S3 Saphire II 83707 Pro hair dryer. My hair comes out shiny and lustrous. However, I find the T3 is OK for my cats after a bath."
3,Not worth the price,The blowdryer is light weight and results in a decent style but I have had two dryers that broke down within a year after I purchased them. I do not think this blow dryer is worth the price.
5,She loves it,"This was a gift for my wife who has just longer than shoulder length, thick hair. She really loves it!"
5,Pleased as punch,"My hair dresser first started me on a T3 about 4 years ago. I loved it. When it began to loose power, I found another T3 on Amazon and am still a T3 fan. I highly recommend this blow dryer - well worth the money."
2,"after 10 months, hair is fried.","I believed the wonderful hype about this dryer. Still, there was one nagging review that said the hair dryer was breaking her hair. I ignored it. I hope you won't.The dryer seemed to make my hair dull. I could live with that. But I started to watch my hair get ""frizzy."" I have wavy hair, and I live in a dry climate; no reason for frizz. But it wasn't actually frizzy - it was actually all the broken ends frying into frizzle. I finally had to admit that the dryer was the problem and I went back to my nearly broken old dryer from 1995.It will take a long time before my hair is grown out and the damage gone. Lots of nourishing hair products and lots of time. And I wasted so much money on a dryer that really hurt my hair. Too late for me, but if you haven't bought it yet, don't do it."
2,died after less than a month,"This hairdryer is lightweight, powerful and quiet as promised, however it completely died after less than a month. It seems like other reviewers had similar experiences. Therefore I would not recommend the product."
1,Order a Bio Ionic instead,"I was going to order a T3 from Amazon but after reading the reviews that the manufacturer would not honor the warranty I ordered a Bio Ionic Whisper Light from Amazon for $173. Works great and because my wife and daughter fight over it I bought another one. It has a 5 year warranty that WILL be honored. If T3 wants to loose out on Amazon sales by being jerks about the warranty, let them."
1,What a rip off,"Seemed to work OK at first although I didn't notice much improvment in speed of drying. It is lightweight and easy to handle -- but it is hotter than I'm used to. After 6 months, my hair started to feel dry and had zero shine. My hair had always been very healthy and shiny before. My hair stylist noticed it and couldn't figure out what was wrong. After about 9 months, I switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again. Maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me, and costly!"
5,Hair Dryer,"This is the second T3 I have purchased, the second was for a gift. It dries your hair fast. Saves a lot of time. Well worth the price"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I don't see a difference between blowdryer and my $15 conair dryer. My hair did not dry any faster, and it is just as frizzy."
2,T3 not worth the $,I recently purchced 2 new hair dryers the T3 and Vidal Sasson Ionic hair dryer. The 2 work about the same except the T3 gets hotter. I would recomend not buy the T3 and go with the cheaper VS brand and it is MUCH cheaper.
1,"Fast Service, Defective Product","I ordered this hair dryer as a replacement because after 4 years, mine stopped getting hot. I was very excited when this hair dryer arrived before expected but so sad when I turned it on and had the same problem...it did not get warm it all."
1,Good results but POOR QUALITY PRODUCT,"This dryer will do a great job on your hair. It dries it quickly, while decreasing frizz and increasing shine. However, I have now had two of these dryers and each one died after a little over a year due to poor design. The way the cord enters into the dryer it is not stable and will constantly move around until the wires break and your dryer quits working. Needless to say, I will not buy a third one... $400 down the drain in two years was quite enough!"
5,Fantastic hair dryer,"I got this hair dryer for Christmas and it is so great I can hardly stand it!! I have used it for 4 days now and every day a good hair day...WOW. I was apprehensive at first cause I thought a dryer is a dryer, but was I ever wrong."
2,Bar Code Problem,"Strangely, the company does not recognize the bar code. Hence they refuse to warranty the product. I think that we paid a high price for a knock-off. I am not pleased with amazon.com."
5,The Best,"I just got my T3 Featherweight and I love it. This is the best hairdryer I've ever owned. It's fairly quiet and dryed my hair, to the roots, in under 5 minutes. I will recommend to my family and friends."
4,Fast Drying,"I have very thick, course hair and with straight iron and blow drying, I was willing to spend the extra $ for good dryer that would not frizz out my hair. I'm very happy with this dryer, it's fast, quiet; even on high which I use when I'm in a hurry and I'm done in about 5 min! My only wish is that the on/off switch were an up/down instead of a toggle switch because while I'm drying my hair straight, I tend to keep turning it off."
2,Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer? T3 won't give warranty coverage,"I like the product. However, having purchased it from Amazon.com, T3 will not allow me to register my product for future warranty because they claim Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer. For such an expensive every day product, a warranty would be nice to have in case anything were to go wrong. I received an email from T3 and a call back both confirming that they do not consider Amazon.com an authorized dealer. When I called Amazon, they had never heard of such a thing. Amazon.com offered to exchange my featherweight tourmaline dryer with another but that did not resolve my issue. I cannot get my T3 Tourmaline Featherweight 83808 hair dryer covered by T3's warranty because it was purchased through Amazon.com."
3,Very light & dries fast but other claims exaggerated,"I first saw this hair dryer on a TV show talking about beauty products used by the stars. Then I noticed my hairdresser had switched to this brand. His observations were the same as mine. If you take a lot of time drying hair and the weight of the dryer is an issue, this is a very good purchase. But your hair will be no shinier or softer than with other dryers."
1,Not for my hair type,"I had been lusting after a T3 forever because of all the rave reviews and finally got one for Christmas. I'm really sad to say that I'm disappointed and am going back to my ionic hairdryer from Sharper Image.To be fair, the glowing remarks about the T3 are written by people with wavy hair that tends to frizz. My hair is long, straight, and shiny, and I blow dry every day for volume. After using it, my hair was shiny, but very limp. I've given up after several tries.The T3 is light, quiet, and looks nice, but I agree with another reviewer regarding the design. When I use it, I tend to knock the switch into the ""off"" position because it's right where I grip the handle. Also, the air flow feels very weak to me, which is not really what I need when I'm trying to volumize.I'm sure this is great product for some people, but if you have straight hair, you should save the $150 (or save someone else the money)."
2,Disappointed,"This dryer is only 1800 watts - I am sorry I didn't read closer, if the wattage was noted, and purchase a more high-powered dryer. I didn't return this one because I discarded everything before realizing it.Mary in VA"
4,Nice,"this was a gift to our Grand parents and this is what they said about it. Very quiet and light, cuts drying time in half"
5,10 out of 10!,I have had many professional and non-professional dryers. This one is clearly the best yet AND it was less expensive than my last professional non-ion one!
3,very disappointed,"It definitely dries the hair faster, but it's still significantly frizzy afterwards. Don't know how I could be doing anything wrong - it only has 2 settings & I've been blowdrying my hair for 20+ years. Not worth the money."
3,"Strike ""complete"" from the title and you might be satisfied!","Despite the author's attempt, the book misses on many levels, the least of which is cross-referencing Zelazny's material instead of 'fluffing' the story he wrote. The Amber language and calendar elements are good. The timeline vs. Shadow Earth is interesting. The omission of Mirelle, Lora, Carmella, while including characters much less central is puzzling. Especially when the author states he had Zelazny's ear to answer such questions. Fans will respect what is included and moan over what is missed here. The geneology chart doesn't agree with other sources. You'll find no mention of Shroudlings, or other elements from the short stories."
4,Good book on a difficult topic,"I know the author and have discussed the book with him. He is one of a very, very limited number of people who have interviewed Zelazny in regard to the Amber series. Ted's book is well written and is a good source for information in regard to the long and somewhat complicated series."
5,Happy and fast delivery,"It came to me in great condition and the shipping looked professional, and fast. This is my favorite movie and was happy that it was in great condition just like it said it would. thanks."
5,My Family,"This is one of the best movies. Loved Jennifer Lopez as the young mother and her struggle to make her way back from Mexico to LA...and as for the old uncle...he says ""when I was born here this was Mexico and when I die here it will still be Mexico"". Loved seeing the changes through time and the families happiness and sorrows...great movie"
5,My Family (Mia Famiglia),Outstanding film that tells the story of of a Mexican immagrant familys experiences over a period from the 1880's to the present. A truly excellent film by noted director Frank Capra that never received the attention it desrved.
5,MOVING FAMILY DRAMA,"First impressions of sweeping epics are usually mundane; not so with MY FAMILY. This movie really grabs your heartstrings. It speaks to every nationality, not just Mexicans. It's filled with raw emotion, love, loyalty and the trials of lives sometimes filled with nearly insurmountable odds. All performances were memorable, but especially Jimmy Smits' who gives a searing performance as Jimmy, the youngest son. By the film's end, you will be compelled to take stock of relationships in your own family, appreciate the ties that bind and the power of forgiveness, then thank God for His blessings, both big and small."
4,Love of the Christ,"Timed to the arrival of the Pope in Washington DC, this film accurately predicts the future of us all."
3,Interesting,"The movie depicted the stereotypical life style that people view Latinos as who are of Mexican ancestery and live in East Los Angeles. Having been raised and growing up in East Los Angeles, I see some of the humor, vugarism and traditions that this story tells. Everyone may not agree with what they see and hear, but once has to live and experience in order to understand...not necessarily agree. I think the movie depicts a Mexican family who goes through the ups and downs of being simply a minority group. Los Angeles is a diverse city and all cultures clash so I think this movie depicts the family clashing with others. Of course it does go into the ""poor me, I'm a Hispanic"" routine but unless you experience what it is like living in a multicultral city as Los Angeles and having to deal with all colors and greeds, then you would understand what it's all about."
3,WE NEED MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE!,"""My Family"" is one of those movies which has something for everyone. It has action when the mother returns to California and has to cross a rapid river. It has love when one of the family members marries to keep a woman from being deported and then they fall in love. It has tragedy when the woman dies giving birth. It has humor when a little boy plays cowboy in his birthday suit when new relatives visit. At times it was difficult to remember who was who by name, but overall it was a great insight into the strength of the Hispanic culture and into the family structure."
2,"Movie great, DVD substandard","The sound on this DVD is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects, making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering. I also have the VHS, on which the sound is perfect, so I can still watch this wonderful movie. But I would sure like to get my money back for the DVD!"
5,Love this movie,Received it right away and the price is wonderful!!! same thing i wouldve payed at the store and i didnt even have to leave my house.
4,Great movie.,I use this as a teaching aid. It's not the version with the language cleaned up - which I can't find after my copy went bad - but it does the job if you can get over the language.
1,"can you say ""most overrated band of te 90's"" ?","I bought this cd without even listening to it and let me tell you it was a waste of money. I kept skipping the tracks desperately looking for a song that I could keep on and actually listen to without getting bored and irritated. This cd is somewhere collecting dust in my room. Maybe I'll use it as a coffee cup holder. If it wasn't for bands like Spoon (whom Pavement has been compared to), I would have given up on indie rock a long time ago. Don't believe the hype."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"I'm not sure how retroactively Pavement's status as definitive indie rock band of the 90s has been awarded but it seems like they became a much bigger deal after they broke up than they ever were when they were together. This debut album could hold it's own against the albums Unrest and Sebadoh released around the same time, but Dinosaur Jr, Yo La Tengo, Buffalo Tom, Sonic Youth, Swervedriver, Superchunk and Archers Of Loaf were making similar more substancial albums. This could be a worthwhile doucment of how ramshackle indie rock can get while still being tuneful some of the time, but it's not a genre landmark or a satisfying listen from start to finish which most fans even seem to admit."
3,Sound a bit bit like The Fall only not as good,"Everyone wants to praise this album, but this is in fact, not as original sounding as some of the later Pavement albums. This album sounds like The Fall - lite. Every idea on display on this record was directly stolen from Mark E. Smith, a man with more talent in his pinky than SM and SS combined. The sound of this album is pretty enjoyable, after all it sounds like a lost Fall album. As for another reviewer who said that Pixies and Sonic Youth records haven't held up over time....hunh? Both of those bands in their prime were also much better than Pavement...especially The Pixies."
4,"Unusual, interesting, intelligent, deeply human","Miller writes about that element which perhaps makes us all too human...pain: not just the physical sort, but also mental and emotional. This man... this ""freak"" character who knows no pain at all seems so bold ...and inhuman. But the moment he loses this characteristic is moving and remains in my mind..."
4,Poetic historical meditation on what it is to be human,"James Dyer, Andrew Miller's main character in Ingenious Pain is still with me. For a character who has no emotion to begin with, that's kind of odd.When I first read taht James Dyer had no emotion, I expected --silly me-- a character who was fairly flat. But Andrew Miller proves to me that a character without emotion with only intellectual brilliance but no emotional intelligence would naturally fall into pride and arrogance. His character, James Dyer, is uncaring, arrogant and belittling of other people's pain. When he becomes a famous ultra reputable doctor, he only cares about money.And when he becomes mad because he finally understands those emotions he has always belittled: love, fear, sorrow, it is perfectly understandable.I liked the ending, too. He's finally redeemed. It's not ultra dramatic like those plot-driven American Blockbuster movies, but it rings true."
2,Just couldn't get into it.,I just could not get into this book. I think it started out a little confusing and a bit boring. I have too many other books to read to be able to waste time trying to get into this one. Sounded interesting but it couldn't keep my attention.
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF 1997,What an accomplishment for an author. Mr Miller takes what would seem a totally depressing theme and weaves a masterpiece. You will in no way be disappointed with this read. Excellent!!!
5,The healing hands of a woman,"It is a rare pleasure, indeed, to find an author who knows the english language and thoroughly researches the background of his book. Above all - how often do you get such an original idea? It is a medical fact, that, probably due to some neurological quirk, some people do not feel physical pain. They tend to be ""heartless"" because, in fact, you cannot hurt them. The person of Maria is a stroke of genius. As to Catherine the Great: The southern part of her empire, around the Crimea, had been depopulated time and again by outbreaks of smallpox. But people were afraid of the inoculation, believing that it would probably kill them. Catherine then sent for the best known doctors in France and Germany, had herself inoculated, and then her palace staff. her personal guard, and so on.I am waiting for the author's next book!"
4,Visually Captivating,"Overall, I liked this book a lot. There were parts that seemed perfunctory (the entire boy Dyer as carnival sideshow scheister) and other parts where I was just like, ""Where is this going?"" (Shakespeare in the mental hospital). But, as others have stated, the sensory detail is captivating and the language lush, evocative and original- and made England of yesterday a lot more enthralling and vivid than the vasted overated, plodding and stylistically repetitive ""An Instance of the Fingerpost""."
4,An interesting view on what it means to be human,"An extremely unique tale of a man born without the ability to experience pain or pleasure - and his journey back into the 'realms' of humanity. Miller stresses the relation between pain/pleasure and conscience/humanity. A little over the top, but a VERY interesting, and at times humorous, book. Read it..."
2,An unworkable idea,"Miller writes beautiful prose, but that's not enough to save this heartless book. Since the protagonist can experience neither pain nor joy, he's doomed to be a pretty boring guy to be around for any length of time. And when sensation does arrive, well, it wasn't exactly worth the wait."
2,NOT A DIGITAL SCALE!!!!!,"Amazon item description states this item is a DIGITAL SCALE!! IT IS NOT!!! It is only a device to hold fish and to measure length NOT WEIGHT, though the item description states ""Digital scale weighs lbs and oz, or kilograms."" Very unhappy :( RETURNING ITEM FOR REFUND!!!"
2,Chintzy Piece of Plastic,"Talk about an upset, when I attempted to install this on the bottom bracket of a mountain bike for my front derailleur shift cable, it did not fit in the hole at the base of my bottom bracket shell, i shaved a few bits off the plug to make it fit using a razor knife, when I finally got it to work; the cable, when used to shift, caused the guides stopper, the two cross bars in the picture, to fail which means the cable tore right through the stopper and made this thing essentially useless.But thats what you get when you spend a dollar for something I suppose."
2,understanding nutrition,"I recieved the wrong book. It was about 3 versions older than it was supposed to be, but it still works!!"
4,Very Good Office Phone,This phone works with most telephone bank systems as well as regular phone lines. All of the features work just as advertised. I would buy more.
4,spellsong war,the book was recieved promptly and was in good shape as advertised. I would order again from the same shipper. This was the last book I needed in the series and I was glad to be able to find and purchase it.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Anna has won one battle, and is now regent for a boy who is not yet of age. She has the respect and support of one powerful noble, but the others resent this woman's interference, and plot.So do all the other countries around the place, and even though a powerful sorceress, there is only so much she can do before she dies."
2,An extra star for good intentions,"I'm sure Modesitt wanted to do a good thing by showing a strong female character in a world full of stupid sexist men. Certainly there is some truth to the fact that this happens. However, sometimes it's even worse to be patronizing, to make the woman a bitchy crab and the men consistently awful. This does nothing to span the gap between the sexes, and it makes for a boring, badly written book.In addition. as a musician, I have to take exception to the praise for the musical content. It stinks. I'm sorry. I don't care if Mr. Modesitt is married to a music professor. He has no sense of it in his plotting or writing.This is midlevel fantasy. I wish I liked it better, because I think he had the right intentions."
3,"Not bad, but should be condensed. Annoying at times.","Our protagonist, Anna, doesn't like bloodshed, but finds she cannot avoid it. L.E. Modesitt won't let us forget it - he repeats it over and over, as he does with Anna's need to constantly eat. He needn't be incessantly describing it!The book would make a better read if Anna were smarter - many of her solutions are plain brute force, where something subtler would have been more appropriate."
2,acceptable nighttime fluff,"A somewhat pedestrian sequel continuing Anna's travails through what is essentially a fantasy-by-the-numbers world. Anna lurches from crisis to crisis solving them with ruthless efficiency and in doing this, Modesitt has avoided the common tendancy to have a supremely powerful character agonise for chapters before taking action that most of us would realise is inevitable. Don't look to this book for in depth characterisations or novel concepts. Treat it as light reading and you won't be disappointed."
1,This book took forever!!,"I couldn't wait to finish this book, but unfortunately it took forever. There was no excitment in this book, none of the energy present in his Recluse series is here - I think he may have felt the same way: when will this book end?"
3,Review of The Spellsong War by L. E. Modesitt Jr.,"I enjoyed the novel ""The Soprano Sorceress"" and I was looking foreward to reading ""The Spellson War."" I enjoyed the book. However, I was shocked by the language. The Lady Anna, in my opinion, would not use crude and vulgar expressions such as the F and Sh words. One might expect such language from low-bred teens and soldiers, but not from decent college professors. Educated people usually have sufficient vocabulary to express themselves without resorting to crude or opbscene language.""The Spellsong war"" is wonderfully conceived, and executed. I feel sorry that the author chose to use vulgar expressions to make the book ""cool."""
3,The Harmonies were a bit off key,"Well this is the 2nd book featuring Anna the Soprano Sorceress. I did wait for this one to come out and I hate to admit it but I was a bit disappointed. The story seemed to really plod along at times, in fact at some points it was actually boring! Also I realize it's a feudal society but is every man really that much dumber than the females?? Anyway while it wasn't as great as the first I must say overall I did enjoy it. The multiple unresolved and tangled plotlines really kept me intrigued. Modesitt is also doing a great job of showing that being the ruler ain't all that great and that being the biggest shark in the water tends to attract every other shark. Well here's to hoping the 3rd book is on par with the 1st!"
4,Harmonious Fun,"I stumbled onto the first book of this series,""The Soprano Sorceress,"" in the library and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was even more pleased to see that Modesitt had made the premise into a series. Anna is a strong and likable charecter sent into hard, dry, gritty times. Modesitt paints almost too realistic a setting making me wish for just a little relief by way of greener scenery or ease for the main charecters. I personally do not care for so much carnage and war in what I read, but I cared enough for Anna to read nonstop to the end. More on minor charecters that actually live would be nice. Do not be deterred. This is a great and fun read. A natural for anyone who understands the power of music and loves fantacy."
3,Not that good,"This is the first book I buy on compact .net. Granted, I can't compare with others.Still, there are things I miss. First and foremost, Amazon's description says the book covers ""Custom controls with Windows Forms Designer support"". This isn't correct. The book just says ""in can't be done in VB due to a bug in .NET, so the following examples must be in C#"".Also, there's no talk on locking your application so it's impossible to get out of it (for example when your app is the only application supposed to be used in a device - imagine the device that the UPS guys use).Regarding what IS on the book, it's well explained and (more or less) through... but everything is on MSDN or just google. No special material here."
5,A Child's History of Art but for adults too.,"V. M. Hillyer wrote this book over seventy years ago and it is still being recommended as excellent school curriculum today. Hillyer does a phenomenal job of making the art world interesting to the young student as well as to adults. He covers the major painters and art periods and then continues with sculpture and architecture. An adult would receive an excellent overview of the arts by reading this book and it makes an engaging book for children to be introduced to the world of the arts. At over 400 pages, it is a great investment."
3,The slapstick overshadows the story,"I usually enjoy reading Abigail Timberlake if for no other reason than it will usually make me laugh. I found with this book, that the comedy was forced and almost slapstick. This took away from the story and I just read to get to the end. In the book, Abigail, her mother and her two friends, Wynnell and CJ go to Savannah to claim an inheritance that Abigail gets from a long-lost cousin. While there they meet a number of local people who are scary, silly and downright dangerous. Abby tries to find her cousin's valuable coin collection, but there are a number of people that are after it too. Of course Abby and her mother end up in a pickle that they have to get themselves out of at the end. Pretty predictable stuff."
3,Not Up to Par,"It took me a while to read this book, which is a rarity for me when I've got hold of a Tamar Myers mystery (Den of Antiquity OR her Penn-Dutch series). Although the book takes Abby to a different locale (Savannah) there isn't much action in it. Ms. Myers' humor is not up to par in comparison to her other books. Some of the plot and characters seem contrived - too coincidental, and it just didn't make her usual grade. I downright dislike what she did with Abby's mother in this one. It's way out there. Read if you must, but don't expect it to be one of her best."
3,A Penny Urned,"I was so looking forward to the next book in this serier, but found myself disappointed instead. I felt like Ms. Myers woke up on the wrong side of the bed and took it out on her characters. I grew agitated with Abby and her mother at several different points in the book. There was also a reference to Magdaline Yoder that I thought was rather extreme. I can only hope that Ms. Myers is in a different mood when she writes the next book. There were still some very witty moments, and if you have read the other books in the series you won't want to miss this book."
4,Very good Abby Timberlake mystery.,"Even if you haven't read another book in the Den of Antiquity series yet, you could start with A PENNY URNED and not have missed anything. Here we're with Abby, her mom, and friends in Savannah, where we get to enjoy some of the local color while we watch them on a search for all manner of things, including lots of answers. There's a ton of silliness and a satisfying mystery, and the ending is really fun. Tamar Myers always leaves me wanting the next book. This edition even very kindly provides you with little excerpts from each of the six preceding entries in the series that began with LARCENY AND OLD LACE."
4,The Surf Set,"3 cd box set of surf & hot rod music (72 tracks) by: beach boys, dick dale, surfaris, jan & dean, ronny & daytonas, fantastic baggys, bruce johnston, honeys, rip chords, four speeds, super stocks, knights, sandals, donna loren, tradewinds, james darren, astronauts, chantays, and many more"
1,A disaster,"An editor has never laid eyes upon this book. It is an absolute disaster, a total mess. You cannot, repeat, CANNOT learn evidence from this book. You must go by the Federal Rules, coupled with any other explanatory source. Unfortunately, my professor is using its numerous sample problems in class; I read the assignments until I realized that the supporting / explanatory material was worse than useless, it was misleading at best and frequently erroneous. Turning to other materials was the only thing that saved me. Avoid at all costs."
3,"Wonderful For Some, Not So For Me","The problem I have with the books that Victoria Magazine publishes (and I own a few now) is that they are often a well-done rehash of what has already been printed (text & photos) in their monthly magazine. Don't get me wrong, I adore Victoria Magazine and have subscribed for years and enjoy most issues. Books like The Passionate Shopper are great for someone who doesn't read the magazine because then the content is new and fresh and wonderful. But if you are a regular reader, it's often stuff you've already seen in a pretty new hard cover and you'll feel cheated, like I did."
4,dream book,"the book was very interesting, i found the stories helpful, and it gave me some insight into all the dreams i've been having. it wasn't 100 percent for me though, it was mostly stories people had submitted, and their review written beneth them, but it also had a sort of dream item encyclopedia in the back. i would reccomend this book to anyone"
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I was purchasing it as a gift. For $25.00 I expected something a little more mature. It looks like a child's book and the very few pages of dream dictionary included in the back are limited. I need to spend another $25.00 on a real book to give. I cannot return it because they will deduct the free shipping cost from the purchase price. With the return cost of shipping and that fact, the total is almost what I paid for the book."
2,Nothing special,"Nothing glaringly bad, but absolutely no appeal for me, personally. Although I would love to just find a well-written, current, romantic gay novel, I haven't found it yet. This book was written in the 70's so I suppose I should give it some slack. Also, it felt too religious for my taste."
3,The More Serious Side of Benson,"Is this Required Reading for Luciaphils? One cannot imagine it not being so. However, there is little hilarity to be had here. Once one has imbibed those limpid waters of Tilling and Riseholme, one will not want to descend from those Celestial places to face once again the world of pathos, horror, and desperation that is the setting for many of these pieces.But such an excursion is necessary, for though Benson brings us so much delight, we must also pay heed when he taps us on the shoulder with a grave rejoinder.Optimists all, however, will keep in mind that these are the works of a youthful, headstrong Benson, and it was the mellowing years that begat the exquisite decoction Luciaphils exist on. One would hope all headstrong young authors would improve so."
3,What were(n't) they thinking?,"My reactions to this album ranged from 'the tightest track I've ever heard,' to 'HUH? ' Of course this is ""experimental"" hip-hop though, so you gotta give it some slack. The 3 stars are only because Quannum can do much better than this. See, for example, Latyrx (comprised of Lateef and Lyrics Born), and Blackalicious (both the new one, Nia and the old one, Melodica). Getting back to Spectrum though, TRACK 3 IS SOOOOO DOPE! That's my anthem, yo. I have seen all members of Quannum live, so trust me when I say this - Spectrum could be much better, but some of these individual tracks are near to perfection."
2,Borders hip-hop & rap,"This is THE FIRST Dj Shadow project to disapoint me. Don't go thinking that this album is going to have Dj Shadow's style, cause it doesn't. There's to much rap, and really alot of gangster type style rap. There is one cool song that was done by Dj Shadow & Divine Styler. There is alot of rap in this song, but the beat that Shadow produces kicks ass! Don't get me wrong i don't mind rap, but this style takes to the streets to much.."
3,a classic,really old info. sort of a primer on the history of performance engines. still I learnt a thing or two.
3,Good for the price,"The player is fine and the speakers sound good (even though they are a little bigger than i thought they'd be). I mean it's a good deal for the price, but...The remote sucks. You'd have to get a universal because it doesn't even have a on/off button and you have to point it at a certain angle (you can't just point it anywhere and expect it to work). I don't know if that part is the remote or the player though. I returned w/o trying a universal remote. I saw a cute one at target for the same price."
1,Stay away from 925,"Avoid,Very loud, but the quality of sound is horrible.Remote control sucks.Sub is hardly working.Avoid, Avoid, Avoid"
3,Sweet Amelia Bedelia,"I am not a huge fan of the books, but I do like to read about the things she does. It is quite humerous to read she does things literally. Quite genius of the writer to come up with such a wonderful and well-meaning character. I love the fact that Amelia Bedelia takes every situation in stride and does exactly as she is told.Amelia Bedelia (I write her name fully because Peggy Parish uses her full name throughout the book) in this read becomes the life of the party. Of course, she doesn't mean to, but she and Alcolu makes the surprise shower exactly into that. A big surprise!!It is not one of my favorite Amelia Bedelia books, but it does not fall short of who this lovely character is: sweet Amelia Bedelia. Enjoy.Joy"
3,To Dump For Me,"The Amelia Bedelia series book Amelia Bedelia and The Suprise Shower from a 4 year olds perspective was a funny and entertaining book. She is told to do something and she literally does it a quote form the book ""Amelia Bedelia do run over this with an iron."" Amelia Bedelia got the iron and ran over the table cloth with the iron in her hand. Amelia Bedelia is a great series for younger kids and a good way to teach them to read."
4,Amelia Bedelia,"The Amelia Bedelia series book Amelia Bedelia and The Suprise Shower from a 4 year olds perspective was a funny and entertaining book. She is told to do something and she literally does it. To quote from the book ""Amelia Bedelia do run over this with an iron."" Amelia Bedelia got the iron and literally ran over the table cloth with her feet and the iron in her hand. Amelia Bedelia is a great series for younger kids and a good way to teach them to read. It also helps them to understand two ways of looking at things."
1,Fraudulent Release,"The low score is for the nature of this ill-conceived and dishonest release, not the artist. Coltrane himself plays rather well here, but he is far from the featured artist. Despite the cd title, there were never any Bethlehem ""years"" at all. Coltrane simply sat in as a backup horn during a few sessions in the late fall of 1957 for other recording artists. He takes solos, but only a few. This is simply a good example of how record companies repackage older and forgotten material in a manner more likely to be scooped up by completists. The music in here is ok, but it's not Coltrane, and it's not worth the money."
5,"A review of this recording, not of preconceived expectations","It seems that the previous reviewer wrote a review about what he incorrectly assumed the CD in question should have sounded like instead of what it really is. This is not a Blues Brothers CD, nor is it an hour of saxophone solos. It is instead an adventurous, cleverly crafted, and consistently interesting collection of tunes that go through many different permutations of the jazz idiom. There's some progressive fusion, Latin, funk, straight-ahead swing, and even some country! The arrangements are brilliant and moving, and the performances are superlative. There is truly something for every jazz fan (with the possible exception of those expecting this to be the next Blues Brothers album). Anybody listening to this with an open mind is sure to enjoy it."
1,Misled and terribly disappointed,"I am a saxophonist and clarinetist who totally enjoyed the ""Blue Lou Marini"" solos on the Blues Brothers Albums for years. I will always be enthralled by his solos on Almost and Flip, Flop and Fly. I looked for an album that would feature and spotlight ""Blue Lou"". I thought an album entitled Lou's Blues would be a heavens sent. Instead, it was filled with amatuerish arrangements, and saxophone solos that only a mother could love. I would never have recognized that it was, in fact, Blue Lou. Horrible disappointment! Take my word for it, or, choose to listen to it and be appalled at the sub par product that was put out by Blue Lou."
4,Informative and experiential window into the Other Side,This was not a 'thunder-struck' read for me as I was familiar with many of the concepts; but Moss has traveled and interviewed many people as well as having a close relationship with helping spirits. Informative and interesting.
2,I tried to like it,"I tried to struggle through this book and I tried to like it, but I just couldn't finish it.Too much rambling and anecdotal material. It seemed Moss said a lot, yet wound up saying nothing much."
5,An escort service for dreams and healing,"Personal experience blends with ancient teachings in Robert Moss'sTHE DREAMER'S BOOK OF THE DEAD: A SOUL TRAVELER'S GUIDE TO DEATH, DYING, AND THE OTHER SIDE which offers accounts of death and its survival. Author Robert Moss survived three near-death experiences in childhood and has been dreaming of the departed all his life: DREAMER'S BOOK OF THE DEAD is nearly an escort service, offering insights on dreams, the afterlife, and healing."
3,80s Pop Darlings,"In the 80s, Naked Eyes and Spandau Ballet were two of the biggest bands in the nouveau British music invasion. This album is really more of an introduction to their music than anything. This really isn't a good CD for long-term fans of either group; there's nothing new to find here. But it is a fantastic collection of their greatest songs and makes the listener want to rush out and buy the rest of their catalogues. On the Naked Eyes half, the best bets are Promises, Promises and Emotion in Motion, the former of which is probably their biggest hit on flashback radio today (excepting, of course, Always Something There...). On the flip side, the obligatory True is included on the Spandau half, but the best track is the last track, Lifeline. All in all, this is a good, solid compilation for those new to the work of these artists, and I'd highly recommend it."
1,This album dont deserve to be called Reggae Mix 2000,This CD totally sucks for anyone who likes beenie man type reggae. This CD is like a DanceMix USA compilation. Most of the CD is rap with people in the background talking with a jamaican accent. This Album deserves no stars for the fact it aint real reggae. If you like Rap and the type of music that is on Dance Mix usa than this is good for you. My favorites on this album though are Inner Circle with Bad Boys (theme from cops) Even though this is old it is one of the few reggae songs on the album. Diana King with L-L-Lies is cool. Patra featuring YO-Yo was cool if there was no rapping in the song. Super Kat was cool too. These are the only reggae songs the rest are mostly rap and a few were ska and old time reggae.
3,Not the best but still pretty good,"OK, I have to say that I understand a lot of the gripes that people have about this set. The video edit and the sound mix leave a lot to be desired. This video doesn't capture the feel of actually being at the show (unless you were on the floor and you stand only 3 feet tall...not being able to see over people's heads and outreached arms) The setlist is also a tad bland...but with all of this said, the performance, for me, pulls this one through. It's tough to get the performance with all of the distractions and imperfections, but if you just lose yourself in the band themselves, it's truly a spectacular show. I think, though, that the audio should have been remixed and the video deleted altogether....then this would be a great live album, worthy of getting 5 stars. But since that's not what we got, 3 stars will have to do...bad video, subpar audio mix, but a spirited performance pull this one through."
5,A must have for every fan.,A must have for every U2 fan. The Irish boys prove again why they are the best band in the world. The Great Drum solo by Larry Mullen then Bono on Love N Peace is unbelievable.
3,OK Performance Lacked Passion and Good Song Selection,Love the opening (city of blinding lights) thought that a lot of the performance lacked passion and Bonos voice seeemed strained during much of the show.Wish they would cover more of the Unforgettable Fire Album and play Wire and Unforgettable Fire instead of Pride (in the name of love) the most over-rated U2 Song ever which seems to show up in every performance they give.Beautiful day always a favorite live as was Streets have no name (one of the best live songs ever)
4,"Good concert, though not their best","I just concluded watching the dvd, and have to say I was a bit disappointed. I have seen U2 fifteen times, and am a huge fan. I have seen this tour three times already, and the shows in New York far surpassed what I saw on this film.This was not a great performance, due to the band looking distracted, and Bono obviously struggling with a bad throat. The production of the film and the quality of the editing was in addition, not to my liking.Unlike other dvd's, this film fails to capture the raw emotion one experiences when they see this concert live, and the end product feels very much like it was pieced together.Having said all of that, I realize I will have seen this tour four or five times before it concludes. For those who have not been so fortunate, this will at least allow you to share the memories, and the experience."
2,Disappointed,"As a U2 fan, I was a bit disappointed by this DVD. It's not that the sound or quality is bad, but the performance itself is just lacking. Bono just doesn't sing as well anymore and his voice begins to crack halfway through the show. The band plays like clockwork, but that's the problem--it's just business as usual. Plus there's no ""With or Without You"" which is like having the Police perform a show without ""Every Breath You Take."" Can't believe some people shelled out hundreds to see the show (or people like me who shelled out money to buy the DVD!)."
2,Where is the second disc ?,"I've been waiting for this DVD. The U2 website promised a two disc set.I got my copy of Vertigo and only found one disc. I thought maybe all of the material might be on one disc, but there is no documentary, no bonus material, just the concert.I am a HUGE U2 fan but I feel cheated by this DVD."
3,Feel let down......in Chicago,"I went to 3 of the 6 shows in Chicago. I must say being there live was unbelievable. It was awesome. Knowing it was for a Chicago show, I was so excited about the DVD. Ended up, I am a bit dissappointed by this DVD. I just don't feel like you can sense the energy as earlier DVD releases like Slane Castle or Boston. I think it would've definitely been better if they recorded at one of the later dates. I'm going to just wait for the Milan DVD and hopefully that one is better. Still a big U2 fan!"
3,Couldn't wait for their Milan DVD!,"Considering what they did for the Elevation Tour back in 2003 where they released the Slane Castle DVD, I cannot wait to see their Milan show with better set list (Miss Sarajevo, Still Haven't Found, to name a few). This is still a U2 concert but I honestly cannot recommended this DVD for everybody."
3,"It will be good, but it misses key performances","I am sure the DVD will be good, but the play list is missing some key performances from other shows on this tour.I have seen bootleg video of U2 performing very old and extremely rarely played songs on the Vertigo tour such as:GloriaParty GirlWild HorsesThe OceanMiss SarajevoAll phenomenal. There are some tracks (Party Girl, Gloria) that have not seen the light of day on video since Under a Blood Red Sky. What a shame. The current renditions out on tour would have been well worth the price of admission on this DVD set.As a longtime U2 fan, I somewhat question just how good this will be knowing that many old (and I mean old) songs did not get included in the set list. The Vertigo DVD seems like a retread of the Elevation and Slane Castle DVD sets (excluding the HTDAAB tracks)."
4,WOW!!!,"If you have enjoyed the bands' music since the mid 80's like I have, you WILL like this one. The sequents from "" Love and Peace or Else"" to ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""Bullet the Blue Sky"" are riveting! The whole show is resounding, but that middle section, really, stuck with me. I guess that it just prooves... for a bunch of ""old guys"" they can STILL rock! ENJOY!"
3,"Not quite ""all that"" - buy the 1 disc!!!","I am a huge U2 fan and saw this tour in Charlotte.The 2 disc DVD is not worth the extra money in my opinon.There's really only a couple things on there: a documentary (wow) a music video, and some DVD rom stuff. That's it!!!Buy the jewel case version and save yourself $10."
4,If you don't like the music don't buy it,"Why are there so many of you that insist on writing a bad review on something that you haven't even seen yet? Yes, the first leg of the tour probably isn't the best for a DVD, but it is still an awesome show. I have been a regular staple at U2 shows since the early 80's. I haven't missed a single tour, and usually see them at least once on each leg. Yes, I would love to see something from pop show up in a live show, but that is U2s choice to make. Did you ever think that maybe they aren't happy with the way the songs turned out?I have seen 2 of the 3 legs of this tour in Boston, and will see the 3rd in December, and all i can say is that if you are a true U2 fan who wants to add some great music to thier collection then buy this DVD. I will not rate this 5 stars as I have yet to see the actual DVD, but if it is anywhere near what i saw live then it is a must have."
1,El DVD no se vé,"Uno de los dos DVD, el del concierto no se vé. Lo probé en un equipo Coby y se vé pero el audio es malísimo, no parece ser un disco original"
1,broken case,"I recieved the dvd vertigo by U2...... the outside case is broken, and was broken when I received it.... I would like a NEW one. I wanted to keep this as a keepsake and it sucks that it is broken, can you please mail me a new plastic cover?thanks.Joanne Parker949-235-6675above email."
1,dont waste your moneny on this item,"It is hard to imagine a concert of U2 without ""with or without you"", I mean it is one if not the best U2 song. How can a DVD concert dont have that song. I recomend you, if you want to see a U2 DVD concert to buy anotherone."
2,"Disappointing. Instead, U2 Go Home (Slane Castle) is Much Better","A much better U2 concert DVD isU2 Go Home - Live from Slane Castle. I highly recommend that DVD instead.U2 Vertigo Live From Chicago is flawed in many ways and, frankly, a little wierd. The show is plagued with fast close-up after fast close-up, often at wierd angles. Bono seems to be enjoying himself, but his performance is uncontrolled, slightly sloppy, and even maybe a little obnoxious. Plus, vertigo is not one of the best U2 albums, so the song selection is a little week. Oh, and many of these songs are simply performed better during other concerts.Instead, I highly recommend U2 Go Home, ZooTV, or Rattle and Hum"
4,A vertigo-provoking experience with amazing editing and photography work,"I disagree with the opinion of those reviewers who found the editing/photography of the concert captured in this DVD to be lacking. As a matter of fact, I felt the video was even more interesting as a result of it. I got a feel of being in the stage with the band, very close to them as I was watching it, which is not an experience you can typically have even while attending the concert.Musically, the concert offered an assortment of material, both old and new, to wet the appetites of most U2 fans, plus it accomplished what I've never felt at a U2 concert before: a sense of intimacy with the guys in the band and the audience that is odd for an arena show like the United Center where the taping took place. Overall, while not the most innovative show by U2 ever (that would have to be the Zoo TV Tour video), I highly enjoyed it and recommend it."
1,Extremely unhappy,I am never watching this dvd again it stinks wheres the one in sao paulo? This dvd is edited too much. Where can i find the one in sao paulo?
3,Vertigo Tour,1.Sound-excellent is DTS2.Image-great and are great showmen3.songs selection- nice but not the best4.Bono voice is not at his peakIf you are looking for your first U2 DVD buy Slane Castle is the best.
4,very nice,"i agree with a couple of criticisms. i was at the may 9 concert, and as a previous writer expressed, it really WAS 'a religious experience', this doesn't really come through on the video. also a lot of the visual territory, ie bono's interaction with the crowd, and the circular catwalk was thoroughly mined in slane and elevation. those two are more powerful due to their originality and the enthusiasm of the hometown (slane) audience: 'these people are our tribe'. however i liked hamish's edit, as previous, i thought the band was crisp throughout, and the audio and video are both excellent."
4,Limited Edition a Must for Chicago U2 Fans!,"I received the Limited Edition, two DVD set for Christmas. One disc is, of course, a concert compiled from two shows they did in Chicago, from May 2005. The second disc is a documentary from the day of the show, showing the fans waiting outside, hoping to get picked(randomly) for the elipse near the stage. It is also like having a backstage pass, showing the preparation for the show with interviews with many behind the scenes members of U2's crew.Though I've never seen U2, I have gone to several other concerts at the United Center. The documentary gives a great ""feel"" for the United Center and really shows how U2 transforms an arena and makes it their own.The concert is good, though I think the Slane Castle show from a few years back is better. But I think the Limited Edition is well worth it for any U2 fan who wants a chronicle of what goes on the day of the show, especially for U2 fans from Chicago."
3,Lacks Focus,"Disappointing sums up the review. Way too much camera changing. You get very few shots of the whole band just playing. Jumps constantly from one shot to the next. I had watched it and then the wife and I watched it together. After the second song she asked ""why does the camera angle have to keep changing"". Wow. If she can pick up the problem it must be troublesome.The song selection is terrific. I saw the show in Chicago in Sept and really looked forward to the DVD. Unfortunately our seats were behind the stage. This view isnt much better. Sorry Paul."
3,Amazing Concert Ruined By Too Over Editing,"You won't find a bigger U2 than I, and I went to one of the shows in Chicago, but this DVD just gave me a headache. It's wonderful to listen to, and interesting to watch, but whoever edited/directed this concert video learned all the wrong things at the MTV school of short attention spans, though I'm not sure there's much worth learning about there anyway. The reason why this DVD doesn't feel like a U2 show, and the reason the other DVD's are so much better is that you can't settle into this video. They either didn't have enough consistenly good footage, or they felt like they had to make sure they could justify all of the extra cameras. Whatever the reason, the editors and directors took an amazing performance and hacked it to pieces, which is like making a jigsaw puzzle out of the mona lisa. :("
4,Very Satisfied,"Since i am too cheap to attend a concert, this was a great option. I thought it was great to see everything so close up, U2 certainly puts on a good show, plus think that they are such an interesting band- i like them.This was my first concert video, and i am very satisfied."
4,Gets better each time you see it,"I read some of the negative reviews for this DVD, and there was legitimacy to some of the criticism of this particular show. U2 is a very unique band. There are very few groups that receive the adulation that they get from their audience. The Grateful Dead comes to mind. As a result, they get really comfortable on stage and make some gaffes. It's only natural. But once you get past that, the four guys from Dublin kick into great form, as you'd expect. They have a terrific catalogue, and they display it with no embarrassment. Bono and Edge rule their stage like the pros they are; Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen keep it together, and there you have it: a great show preserved on some digital plastic."
3,"Great band, good audio, poor video","I have been a die hard U2 fan for decades and I am here to tell you that this CD does not do the band justice ! The live audio performance and sound quality is excellent...as expected. The wonderful audio experience is completely offset by the poor video production. The camera work is low quality video (definitely not HD DVD material) and the camera bounces around from scene to scene so fast that you can not take a moment to appreciate what you are watching. The video quality in 'Live From Boston' is much better. Don't get me wrong, I still recommend this DVD for the great audio. It is a good DVD to have running in the background while you are working ! I will always be a huge fan of U2 (just saw them in Oakland), but don't by this DVD for the video experience !"
4,U2 still satisfys,"The one thing that seperates this dvd from the other U2 dvd's is the rawness of the finished product,that isn't exactly a bad thing when it comes to U2.These Irish rockers have been around long enough to know what works and what doesn't,and it works!Bono's voice,Edge's guitar work in all their glory and in all their worst are openly displayed for all to see.The show runs almost two and a half hours long,the new material mixes great with the old.It's not better than Live at Slane but it will satisfy any true or casual fan,enjoy!"
3,Not the best - too managed - too over produced....,"Can't ever give poor marks to U2 - but after seeing them a few nights ago in Miami on Nov 13 I was excited when I got this DVD - until I played it. The boys should have recorded a later show in their tour - there was a certain vitality missing, that communicative link between them and the audience. Perhaps its hard knowing that you're being taped - they should have taped the lot and done an edit so it would appear less rehearsed.Of course, this is a must have in the collection, but manage your expectations..............."
2,One piece of advice to Bono,"Shut up and sing.The majority of your fanbase buy your product for your music, not for your political rantings and silly on-stage graphics. This DVD starts off strong and then degrades into a ""I'm Bono and you'll sit there until I've had my say"" lecture. Just when you think he's done, he out-does himself a song or two later. The man obviously thinks too-highly of himself.I'll be happy to work over this DVD on my computer and edit out the garbage, making it into the fast-paced concert it should have been all along."
2,Just not up to scratch,"The performance and usability of this watch simply do not justify its price tag.1. The HRM function isn't reliable. My $30 unbranded HRM maintains a better wireless connection to the chest strap. Occasionally the X6HR measures false heart rate spikes up to 190. Occasional drop outs or false spikes are not a problem for a simple HRM, but a real pain when you're using the X6HR to record over time, as it screws up heart rate statistics.2. The buttons are too 'mushy'. It's hard to tell when a button has been properly pressed.3. The software the comes with the watch is clunky and ugly.Overall, if you are looking at the X6HR, look at the Polar AXN500."
1,This is not Suunto X6HRM,"Description appears to be Suunto X6HRM (M is for Metal), but the item shipped is in fact Suunto X6HR. I sent it back asking for the good item (which cost me 80, more than 100$) and I had a refund.Thanks a lot it cost me a lot for ... nothing.I will surely order again."
2,A Promising Path...,"Paul Bowles' Let it Come Down is a footpath into the woods which appears promising at its entrance, but eventually peters out. Our protagonist, Dyer, arrives friendless in post-war Tangier and quickly finds the love of his life (a prostitute), and his true calling (illicit currency exchange). He navigates past the expatriate shoals and the native doldrums, and experiences his first original thought (steal the money) when he arrives too late at the foncier. You figure out ""foncier"" from context, but the trail narrows further and eventually the context peters out, too. The trail's end is a hashhish induced torpor in which childhood memories erupt and the essense of irrationality is explored. No worry; we're sitting on a sunny terrace outside Thani's wife's family's shack in the hills of the Spanish Zone, the policia seem to be several miles away, and the birds are singing. Let it come down."
1,Elliptical Trainer,"I received my Elliptical Trainer 24 Sept 2007. The box was not damaged in any way at all. When I opened the box I found there were NO INSTRUCTIONS NOR WARRENTY FOR THE ITEM. Also when trying to remove the base from the bottom of the box I found that the round section was misaligned. Considering we paid mega $$$ for this item, there should be instructions and a warrenty encluded.Disappointed in the item. Now what?Carol"
5,Truly Awesome Connection with Where God Wants You,"My son bought this CD and when I heard it I couldn't believe how awesome this CD was! A little Steve Miller Band, a little Dave Mason, and awesome Godly lyrics. HIGH just brings tears to my eyes. You gotta hear this CD. These guys are the next Jars of Clay or DC Talk. You'll want to hear it again and again."
5,mukala is a musthava,"This is a great album in the electronic-slacker category ala old Beck. The only twist here is that the lyrics are thought provoking and stand up to the quality of the music delivering a very satisfying experience to the consumer. The song ""High"" is probably my fave. It's dreamy ethereal quality is a perfect backdrop for this proclamation to our Creator. The other tracks stand up as well even though the album was recorded a few years back."
4,Suunto X6,This product work great. I would definitely purchase it again. The only concern I have with it is the glass face is very exposed to hitting anything. So far it hasn't been prone to scratching. I put the first and only scratch in the glass within the first week of ownership. I have had the watch almost 4 months now and I have not put any more scratches in it but I am more careful. Other than that the watch work perfectly. I am very pleased.
4,Case Logic Binder--Excellent Buy,"My 180 DVD's, in their jewel cases, used to be all over the house--and took up a lot of space. I bought two of the Case Logic cases (to divide family versus action/thrillers) and now have all my DVD's in one easy to access drawer of my entertainment center. Great time and space saver."
2,Not happy,"Bought it as substitute for the Nikon battery for my D40. Worked great a couple of times.But now days (hardly the 3rd use of it) it discharges in less than 2hrs or so. I tried it a 4th time, same result. So it will be just be a place holder from now for the time the original battery gets charged. This product could have been better."
2,Poor life.,"There's not terribly much more I can say that the title doesn't convey...I charged this up fully and put it into my Nikon D40. Whereas I get days of use (over a week) in my shooting with the original battery, this one lasted less than a day.My shooting style is to pretty much leave the camera on then take a burst of photos when something takes my eye.......then leave it until something else comes along. The original battery copes no problem - the Nikon having a great power saving functionality - but this new battery doesn't really cut it.I'll keep it as an emergency spare, but don't plan on getting a day's worth of shooting from it."
1,Great if noise doesn't bother you,I was very disappointed. The combination of sounds from this unit are unbelievably annoying. Beverage Factory was accommodating.I did return it for a 15% restocking fee and upgraded to a Marvel 50 bottle. It was more than twice the money but the difference is that I have a wine captain that works for me.
5,Absolutely hilarious!,"I purchased this DVD having seen this movie many times before. I just had to have it on DVD. I was very happy to see both sides of the disc utilized. One for pan & scan, and the other in letterbox. Nevertheless, the movie is histerical, and Nathan Lane plays a VERY GOOD queen. He is queenier than the girliest queens I know. Absolutely wonderful. I will continue to watch this movie in the future. As far as the 8-page booklet which is supposed to ship with the video, it doesn't exist. No biggie though."
5,Free Bird,Take the time to be less serious and see the true meaning of life. Labels mark us not the person we could learn from this. Of course being a senator to do what you want.
3,hmm.,"Sexist, homophobic and violent, though it is funny and has some grate camera work (the opening shot is a gem)."
2,robin williams is cold,I liked parts of this movie- but Robin Williams character seemed cold and selfloathing and too cold to his fabulous partner. Where has the warmth between them- actually- where was the warmth from Robin? I don't see why his partner would love him as he was verbally abusive and the only warmth I saw was one tiny scene where he actually holds his partners hand for one whole second! Robins was miscast in this role - it would be better if someone else had his role. Then maybe we could have an actual believable love between the couple. Otherwise this is just mainstream media trying to make a buck of the gay community.
3,The Original Is Best,"I enjoyed the performances of Robin Williams (as always) and Hank Azaria, but this version pales in comparison with the original. Michel Serrault will always be the perfect Zaza for me. The original French version is a classic and I encourage you to view it as well for comparison."
2,Tired,"When Hollywood seeks to remake a Foreign Film, it is usually pretty bad. Case and point is The Birdcage. This movie is a flaccid retelling of La Cage aux Folles. Robin Williamns and Nathan Lane never acheive chemistry for you to believe for one moment that they are lovers. Lane lacks the the charisma to pull of Michel Serrault's role, and he never seems comfortable. Gene Hackman actually stands out in this movie and brings dimension to a character that could have been just one dimensional. He manages to bring charm and some needed humor to this otherwise stale movie. Most unfuriating is Robin Williams who seems to tread out his usual limp wrist routines to the point of being tiring."
1,The Birdcage,I also bought the movie The Birdcage and I can Not watch it because it's not for american TV i AM VERY DISAPPOINTEDand I don't know how to send it back
1,Watch La Cage au Folles instead,Trite adaptation of the French farce. See the original instead which is far funnier and the acting is better.
3,When the bird hits the fan.,"The Birdcage starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane is a funny film but not the best. This film is a bit dated and you kind of lose interest after an hour. Calista Flockhart stars in this as well, pre-Ally McBeal. This comedy is a mixed bag for me."
2,Gets More Annoying With Time,"The more I watch ""Birdcage"" the more it annoys me. The REALLY slow pacing of the story, not to mention the absolutely obnoxious son of two gay men who seem so I'll suited to one another, and Nathan Lane's over-the-top, whinning queen act get tired very fast. What exactly is so funny about two gay men having to hide everything about themselves to please a hateful, right-wing Republican? So if you're a straight, WASP-ish Republican bigot, then all is good? Why do gay men always have to be the brunt of the joke? Maybe straight audiences in 1996 thought this was hysterical, but in 2008 it's just plain old."
4,NOT a bad copy!,"A remake of anything French is a step in the right direction. Except Amelie, leave that alone."
2,"Not his best, by far...","Robin Williams is one of my favorite comedians, but this movie was somewhat disappointing for me, even though there are a number of hilarious scenes in it. The gay Guatemalan house""maid"" is absolutely hilarious and the fact that ultra right wing colleague of moral majority politician Gene Hackman died while visiting an under age, black prostitute made me howl with laughter.Unfortunately, Robin Williams is not able to play a convincing homosexual man with a long-standing relationship. I have never seen a homosexual couple where there was so much distance between the men."
3,Not as funny as it was in the 70's.,"It does not cause impact as the 1st version did. The film is too slow, the preparation of the final dinner is endless. Mike Nichols' direction is straight. But the cast is a highlight. Robin Williams and Nathan Lane make us believe they're really a couple. Gene Hackman has the funniest scene in the movie, dressed as an uncomfortable drag queen. The film is a must for Ally McBeal's Calista Flockhart fans - she plays a beautiful, fresh, youthful and nice daughter-in-law that every parent wishes to have. The film will be better appreciated by the viewers who like to see good acting performances."
2,"Entertaining, but pale next to the French original.","The original French film, La Cage aux Folles, was so good that The Birdcage falls on its face, much like Benny Luke's hilarious Jacob in the farcical French version. Robin Williams is disappointingly unconvincing, and somehow the humor of the French lines fizzles in the English translation. The cast tries hard, but this remake is ponderous. Skip it and see La Cage aux Folles instead."
5,Hilarious,"Robin Williams, of course, is genius, as is Nathan Lane. The two together are absolutely hilarious, a real treat. Gene Hackman is also amazing. A great story and superb performances all around. Highly recommend it."
5,terrific,"I have never seen the original movie (la cage aux faux) so I can not say how it compares, But this is definately one of my favorite movies! Great for a bunch of laughs. It always lifts my spirits up."
1,DVD THE BIRDCAGE,I can't review this DVD because the copy I received was not playable on my system. I have returned it and await a refund. Why send a DVD to the UK which does not match the UK system?Chris Brown (disappointed)
1,Attrocious,"I labored to get through this film. I have a sense of humor, but this film was devoid of anything resembling humor. Nathan Lane is one of the most overrated actors on the planet. He isn't funny at all, period. The story in this was predictable and silly. I did find Pricilla Queen of the Desert to be a much better film than this one, I laughed alot at that film. The Birdcage should get pooped on."
1,Well.....,"I personaly thought this movie was pretty dumb. Granted, I was only 7 when I saw it, but I really didn't like this movie at all, The only funny part was with the naked Greek boys on the soup bowls. Otherwise, it was a dumb, boring movie. I love Robin Williams, and love his work, but this was his worst film. I'm glad he moved on to bigger and better things."
4,Very Good,"This film has a lot of merits, including fine performances by the cast, and a very entertaining plot. It is overall quite captivating, features memorable characters, and is very funny. Definitely worth seeing. The original French version is excellent, and this version, while a little different, is fresher and is just as good."
5,"no matter how many times i watch this movie, i still laugh","this movie is great. the acting is great!..nathan lane's character is a great mother and gene hackman is right on as a sleazy, weak politician. gene hackman is very funny but you never really get to see that side of him and you do in this movie. even robin williams steps out of character and is believeable. my son started watching this movie at age 5 and he stills loves watching it at 18."
4,"Its a good remake, overall","I am loyal to the very first ""La Cage Aux Folles"" which came out in 1978, I have to admit. However, if I had been asked whom should be in a remake of this movie, I definitely would have put Robin Williams and Nathan Lane in it. Very well casted. I do think, however, that the acting on these two guys' parts was a little overdone. In the original, even though Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Serrault were very campy, it never seemed like it was overacted. Williams and Lane were a bit too much for me.However, when it comes to Hank Azaria's part as Agador, that was as funny as it gets. He DOES steal every scene he's in, and, as mentioned in a previous review, thats pretty hard to do with the larger-than-life actors Williams and Lane. Frankly, I think Azaria's part was what probably saved this movie. I might also mention that Gene Hackman in drag is pretty hysterical too - he looks halfway decent as a girl, I must admit."
5,so nce to find this online without going out shopping,"Thank you for a great experience of receiving this ""gift"" for my friend in a timely manner - good condition and making my shopping so much easier for the holidays this year, to find exactly what I needed! ;)"
5,Robin Williams,plays the straight man in this film adaptation of the Broadway play. I could watch it at least once a month. Excellent.
4,I love the movie,This is one of my favorite movies but the streaming wasn't good. There were too many pauses to allow it to buffer.
5,oh.. my ..,"Yesterday I watched this amazing comedy .. for the 5th or 6th time now. I love the way Nathan Lane and Robin Williams act in this picture, I mean it took a lot of preparing for those roles ;) Well of course you know they are both the greatest actors EVER, I cant imagine anyone else playing the two.. ""love birds"". Nathan Lane is just so good at being the ""woman"", I couldnt help laughting at his screaming and wailing.. and his WALK! If anybody has missed this incredible film.. I suggest buying it right now, it`s a thing you really want to own and have in your private dvd collection!"
5,Great game for young kids,"My children (2,4,6 years) love this game. My two year old is learning how to take turns, count, and colors. My four year old is learning colors and memorizing where the eyes are. My six year old is learning how to be patient with his younger siblings because they take longer. The pieces are durable (my 6 month old likes to hold on to them and squish them) and fun colored. We enjoy this game as a family and are looking to purchase more blueorange games in the future."
1,Inaccurate about my people,"I am actually living in Normal, Illinois and I can tell you there is no white trash here. It is nothing but subdivisions, bad commercials, State Farm, and college students. If this book was actually going to be about Normal, Illinois it would be about yuppies and college students, and families with 2.3 kids and a dog who live in subdivisions named after animals and colors (I live in White Eagle)."
2,Daniel's review,"I did not like the book. It was too easy. I would not recommend to a 7th or 6th grader, more like a 4th or a beginning 5th grader. It is a childish book.The story is about a two girls named Bonny and Bobbie. Bobbie comes from California to see her cousin and to learn how to ride bulls. One day when they wake up they find some one stole their horses, cows, and their bull, Diablo. Will they find the thieves?"
2,Glenn Gould should not get a free pass,"Ok. Glenn Gould *is* very good indeed (almost as good as Dong-Hyek Lim), but, all the same, he should not be given a free pass by his devotees. I will be the curmudgeon who awards the recording just two stars, not because of his (often eccentric but always interesting) interpretations, but because of his G-d d--n *humming*, for heaven's sake. Music is all about sound, and Gould's annoying and deliberate humming (especially audible in the 1981 set) spoils all his recordings. If the set was entitled ""Sing Along With Glenn"" I'd give it at least four stars, but it isn't titled that.I'm prepared to be awarded ""0 out of 600 people found the following review helpful"". But if you *don't* want to listen to Bach's sublime variations hummed, beware of buying this set."
3,overrated?,"This is not to devalue the very good merits of Gould but his Goldberg was not a turn-on to me; nevertheless, the front picture on this album is very ""sexy"" (I may sound rather perverse)-- I prefer Perahia's version (despite his being un-sexy)."
4,Is it just me ?,"The CDs sounded just fine on my laptop, but when I was listening to the 1981 recordings on my ipod mini there it was, loud as a leaky faucet and just as distracting: Gould humming along as he played ! At first I figured I was hearing things, but it became increasingly difficult to ignore the constant ""hmm hmm hmm""s that kept fading in and out like some sort of auditory tease. Is anyone else experiencing the same problem ?"
1,"Soy is no good, for people with immune disorders","IF you have an immune disorder like hypothyroidism, soy is not your friend. It can cause allergies, weight gain (severe weight gain), aches, pains, headaches, nausea, tiredness, and the list goes on. Please do your research before deciding to consume soy. I loved soy for years and ate it in the form of tofu, soy milk, veggie burgers, veggie dogs, etc. and it only did damage to my body. I know several people whom soy did damage to them, but yet to find one person soy helped someone. I think it is whoever is behind the ""soy industry"" that is making the health claims of it."
5,Laughter is good for the soul.,"This movie is my favorite movie, it makes me life but it also keeps lifes blessings in perspective. I am not a person that likes to watch movies over and over again, but this is the best. This movie so funny you will be laughing hours later over the realism and perfection of acting. The kids in this movie where underrated during this time and should have been commended highly of their wonderful performance. This movie is what makes true legends like RICHARD PRYOR AND CICELY TYSON who they are today and forever will have the effects on America.This movie is wonderful"
5,Review of DVD Purchase,I am very satisfied with the product. It arrived in a timely manner and did not have any defects. Excellent job. Thank you.
3,"Not their best, but another step in the right direction.","Personally, I think this album rocks WAY more than Solid Ball of Rock. They managed to strip a little more left-over 80's polish, leaving behind good guitar tones (first in a while) and stronger songs.My only complaint is the cover of ""I Just Wanna Make Love To You."" No need for it, really... not bad, but I skip it every time.Enjoy this one, knowing that Dogs of War came next and Saxon were on the march to regain their rightful place in metal."
1,Forever pedestrian...,"Still finding their feet after their obnoxious glam / hair metal phase of the middle-eighties, Saxon returned to a more traditional heavy metal sound in SOLID BALL OF ROCK. FOREVER FREE follows that direction, but with one unpleasant surprise: the album is simply bad. No imagination. Boring, pedestrian and one of the worst entries ever in the otherwise generally very good Saxon catalog. The songs are lifeless, the playing is going through the motions. Only with UNLEASH THE BEAST (1997) would Saxon recover their former glory."
2,Bland and generic....,"SAXON only regained their best moments (after their pathetic attempt to sell-out in the middle eighties) with 1995's DOGS OF WAR. This FOREVER FREE is a generic, pedestrian Saxon effort, but obviously much better thatn thei hair metal albums of the eighties. SOLID BALL OF ROCK was the first sign of an attempt to rescue their heavy sound, but FOREVER FREE seems to have been rushed to seize the moment.It's not a bad all, it's simply forgettable in the middle of the amazing Saxon back catalogue."
4,"Buy ""Get Your Act Together"" Instead","I'm a big fan of these ""Slob Sisters"" and even started a support group of local ""SHE's,"" so I was really surprised to recently pick up a copy of ""Get Your Act Together"" (GYAT) and see how many things the Sisters changed their opinions/instructions on in the 15 years since they'd written the ""Sidetracked Home Executives"" book. I think the changes are good ones and I wish the original book copyright had not been updated and resold. I still like the first SHE book, I still think it offers great insights as to WHY we SHE's are so disorganized, etc., but The Get Your Act Together book really is a new and improved system compared to the first one."
5,This book will take you from Pigpen to Paradise!,"Since Pam and Peggy started off being disorganized, they really know how to guide you from being a messy, disorganized housekeeper to being organized, systematic, and to have a great looking house and a great life! They have a very adaptable system so that you can work outside the home or be a homemaker and still use their suggestions. This book has made my family happier and given me more time to do the things that are important. I don't cringe when my friends drop by. It's a freeing feeling!"
5,Great Tool no matter what stage of organized you are!,This book is a great tool for everyone. Whether you just need a few tips or you need to totally begin at the beginning. I love the humor with which the information is presented. It has helped me to get my ADHD child to keep his room clean! (Something I thought imposible)
2,Book,Not impressed - wouldn't buy it again. no story just a couple of chapters then some idea's to change things. Most of it is common sense.
3,SHE's Unite,"I heard about Fly Lady many years ago and her style is based on this book. I've tried to use this book to develop my own home plan and although it doesn't work perfectly for me, I have gleaned a lot of information and applied a lot of this book's advise. I recommend this to anyone that wants to get control of their household. It's a good first step. Please take a look at [...] also."
2,"Happy with transaction, unhappy with book","The book is definately not what I was hoping for. I was hoping to make life easier but if I followed the instructions, it would give me another job to do. Anyway, transaction was good and would use this seller in the future."
3,I am not alone!,"I loved this book because I felt such a camaraderie with the authors. I recommend it because it does help to know you aren't alone. This book helped me discover what needed to be done. It wasn't as helpful in helping me get it done. Julie Morganstern's book Organizing from the Inside Out was more helpful, but I might not be doing that as well if I hadn't read this first. Overall, it's a good book on a difficult subject. The system is better than nothing, but very demanding."
3,"I liked it, but it was a bit overwhelming for beginners",I read it but I needed something much more remedial. I found Sink Reflections to be much more helpful for someone at my level of housekeeping.
3,an ok book,"Some good ideas, shows those who are overwhelmed how to tackle things one step at a time. I am not using the method-I found it too constraining and made my own system. It did give some advice that I was able to chage to suit my own system but over all I don't think there is much here. If you can get a used copy for a couple bucks go for it! Personally I think if someone has so much junk in their house they can not move they need to see a professional to find out why they are holding onto junk-there is something deeper going on and they need help."
2,Waste of money if you have the original S.H.E. book,"Years ago, I purchased the ""Sidetracked Home Executives"" book which I found to be entertaining and inspiring, and I was THRILLED to find out that Pam Young & Peggy Jones had just released a new book on the topic. However, I was very dismayed to find that the only thing different in this book is ONE chapter (about 8 pages) pertaining to using a database program on your home computer instead of the 3x5 card system. They only say that they like Lotus Notes but that other database programs are available....in other words, it's not an instructional chapter on HOW to use the database, just that it's an option. So, if you have the original ""Sidetracked Home Executives"" book, don't waste your money on this revised edition. All the other chapters, pictures and drawings are IDENTICAL to the original."
5,This Book Worked for Summer Chores,"When my kids were old enough to stay home alone during the summer months while my husband and I were at work, I looked for a way the kids would be productive and responsible. I didn't want them sleeping all day or getting into mischief. We put this system into works. The only rule was, the cards for that day had to be done before we got home from work. That meant the kids were responsibile for time management, as well. The system worked very well and we even expanded it to include meal preparations. I found out later that they would bribe each other with their chore cards!On a personal note, I loved this book. The personal humor and success stories were enjoyable to read. This program works for me because I am not a morning person. I can't THINK in the morning. I can, however, do whatever is written on the cards, completing one job and moving on to the next. By the time all the chores are done, I'm awake and the rest of the day is mine!"
5,Sidetracked Home Executives,"Easy and entertaining read, plus tons of great, practical ideas for getting your home and life, organized!"
2,Not what I'd expected,"I was not very impressed with this book. While the stories told are interesting, I didn't find as much from this book to help me as I'd expected. I got a lot more from Marla Cilley's book ""Sink Reflections""."
2,Very dated IMO,"Not at all what I had hoped for in an organization book. Too many personal pictures and stories -- I kept wanting to shout, ""Enough about YOU! Let's get to work!"" Also too many religious references for my taste. As for organization style --ues index cards to get organized? Hmmm ... not for me. Just not my cup o' tea."
3,It's in French,I screwed up the Amazon version is in French. Overstock has it in English. When I get motivated I will see how good it is. Amazon get the English version we are in America you know.
4,"Great with tahini dip, cheeses or other topping","These crackers with no fat are nice and crispy with a topping or a dip. With 0 grams fat, 100% whole wheat flower,no preservatives, only 55 mg of sodium, and 45 calories per 15 gram serving they are tasty but not great straight from the box. With a topping I really enjoy them and will order again."
3,First book in Pakistan about its topics,"Tarq Rehman is wellknown socio-linguist of Pakistan . It is his famous book about languages' movement in Pakistan . These movements are semi- political,therefore we we can't say that all these movements are for the promotion of languages, because author is government servant therefore sometimes he take plea according policies of governmentI dont feel fear to say that this is only book on this topic therefor it is very useful and informative for those people who want to know about languages'movements in Pakistan .I recmend this book for kind study of those people who want to know about Pakistani languages"
3,"The closer you look, the better it is","My first quick perusal of this book lead to a mild sense of disappointment, but the more I studied the pictures, the more I came to appreciate their artistry. And while the pictures may be from the '60s and '70s, some poses seem very 1950's style. I would also prefer one picture of each model--and therefore more models. But the pictures are of high quality. All in all, a real Mel Roberts fan-either for eroticism or nostalgia-might easily enjoy his videos much more"
2,A major disappointment,"When I read about the publication of Mel Robert's photos in the Advocate, I was anxious to get a copy for I fondly remembered his photos of All-American young men from The Young Physique and other publications of the 60's. California Boys, unfortunately, doesn't represent the Roberts' style or subjects that I was hoping to see again. Within the pages of this--admittedly--well presented book is a collection of teeny-boppers and twinks that might represent the period, but not the style that I so fondly remembered. Only a four-page spread of model Gary Seegar represented the Roberts that I had longed to see again. If I had been able to preview this work, I would never have wasted the money."
2,The only thing that dove was my interests... - lex,Very dissapointed... I expected greater things from Luther
