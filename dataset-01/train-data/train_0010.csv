2,Pampers June shipment -Product quality was poor,The june 2011 shipment of the pampers cruisers diapers was way below par. The diapers were too thin and leaking all the time.I'm on auto-shipment
3,a little small,"I have been using the sensitive since my son was born. I love it but since baby dry and swaddler is cheaper, I figure I try them as well. I found that the baby dry seems to be smaller than the other two. my son is now 16lb but the baby dry is already very tight. The swaddler and sensitive are fitting just fine."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I CHANGED FROM HUGGIES TO PAMPERS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE BUT NOW I SEE THAT HUGGIES IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE. MY SON USED PAMPERS WHEN HE WAS BORN JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE BRAND THE HOSPITAL WAS USING, BUT I QUICKLY CHANGES TO HUGGIES AND WAS VERY PLEASED. THEN I DECIDED TO GIVE PAMPERS BABY DRY A TRY SINCE THE PRICE WAS CHEAPER AND I GOT MORE DIAPERS FOR MY MONEY. THEY RAVE ABOUT A BABY DRY SYSTEM THAT LAST 12HOURS.....NOT AT ALL. MY BABY LEAKS AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS. THE DIAPERS ARE EXTREMELY THIN. I STILL HAVE SOME HUGGIES LEFT OVER AND I HAVE TO USE THOSE FOR NIGHTIME BECAUSE IF I USE THE PAMPERS MY BABY WAKES UP CRYING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NITE ALL WET THROUGH HIS ONESIE, PJ'S AND CRIB SHEET!!! HORRIBLE DIAPER...NOW I'M STUCK WITH OVER 200 DIAPERS. I'M GOING BACK TO HUGGIES AS SOON AS I FINISH THIS PACK, UNFORTUNATELY WILL HAVE TO BUY HUGGIES OVERNITES MEANWHILE I FINISH THE PAMPERS."
1,I wish there was a no star rating!,These are awful! They gave our son an angry red raw rash all around his pelvic area! We even took him to the doctor thinking it may have been some time of Thrush from antibiotics! Do not purchase these if your child has sensitive skin or may be allergic to the filler!
1,"Huggies Snug and dry Is much better, and are almost same price","I made a huge mistake by buying the baby dry after reading through the reviews. I thought that for the price, why not try them. What a huge mistake! I should have just bought a smaller amount to try them first. Instead we have been using these for over a month now and I have had to clean up a poop spill at least every other day. My baby was 4 months old when we started using these and since he is not eating solids yet, the poop is pretty runny. The baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on. It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the HuggiesSnug & dry from now on, The Snug and dry from huggies absorb much better that those lousy ones, Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Snug and dry or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SNUG AND DRY!!"
4,Impossible to use just one.,"These are fine wipes, nice thickness and scent. But it is seriously irritating that you can't ever pull out just 1 with one hand. I guess they overlap too much. It reminds me of the magic trick with endless scarves tied together that just keep coming out of the top hat. We're constantly shoving them back in the dispenser. This won't keep me from buying again, but it is one of those quietly irritating things you deal with every day."
2,Pampers vs Huggies,"With 3 grandchildren, I've tried many disposable diapers and my daughter and I feel that Pampers does not, in our opinion, measure up to Huggies."
4,Not as good as the swaddlers,"I had good luck with these diapers, but found the Swaddlers fit better. These Baby Dry don't have the stretchy tabs, so they are harder to get a good fit. I know the size 3 has the stretchy tabs, but I guess the smaller sizes don't. These diapers never leaked! I always have great luck with Pampers products. Would definitely recommend."
3,Ordering diapers - excellent Baby Dry - not so much,"This is our third child, so I have tried a lot of diapers. I was debating between the Pampers and the Huggies, but for this size the pampers have not been impressive. They do not absorb well, so it seems that our little guy has a lot of leaks along the top in front. Ordering the diapers to be delivered to the door was great, though, good price speedy shipping definitely recommend!"
2,They leak :(,"I loved swaddlers but they are only in small sizes so I moved to baby dry. Well with teething there is diarrhea and even when I ran to the changing table to change him after an audible bm it was on it's way out of the top back of the diaper and the sides, also I bought them thinking they had the flexible side panels, which are wonderful because you don't feel like your cutting off your babies circulation if you want them snug. I must have received an older box and it did not have the flexible sides. I have since switched to cruisers and love them."
1,Most likely your order will not ship - do not order,Do not buy diapers from Amazon. Your order will likely not ship unti lafter a couple of months or one fine day you will discover that your order has been cancelled because they ran out of stock. Not only that if your original order had multiple items on it and had qualified for free shipping they will charge you the shipping amount even though they are unable to fulfil this part of your order. I have voiced this concern strongly to CS and believe this is a false business practice they are following. If I were you I'd stay away from diaper shopping at Amazon.
4,Hold more than swaddlers,I bought these because they were a great price. We had always used the swaddlers before. These actually hold better than the swaddlers. I don't think we have had one leak with these. I have a boy so you know the front is where all pee collects. Once he started rolling over and sleeping on his stomach they don't hold up. I actually switched to cloth for the night time.
5,"Absolutely the best for my baby, but expensive",After trying several brands only pampers are working for my baby since he has very sensitive skin.I wish they were cheaper but they are definitely the best!
5,The Best Diapers for our Munchkin,"We love these diapers. They keep our little munchkin very dry. At seven months, he's never had a diaper rash. He's been sleeping through the night since two months and ends up with some VERY wet diapers by morning. So to never have had a diaper rash, I am super impressed. As for ""blow-outs,"" I can't comment. Our poor little guy tends to be constipated... But as my sister would tell you, there may not be a diaper out there that can handle some babies' blow-outs.My only advice to parents that think these are too leaky is to try another size before switching. My son is so tall that he'll have to go up a size before the weight guidlines indicate they'll fit. We know it's time to go up a size when he does have lots of leaks."
5,Very happy with Pampers Baby Dry,"We have tried a variety of different diapers on our newborn, and these are our favorite. Our baby has never had any issues with leaking or blow outs with these diapers, and they hold so much that we don't have to worry if he sleeps through the night. We definitely prefer these over the Huggies diapers, and I believe we even like them more than the Pampers Swaddlers."
4,Pamper Baby Dry Economy Pack Plus,"My kids are growing up with Pamper. This is a good price with great quality. We have a small problem in one or two boxes that the diapers have defects (flaps are missing, velcro missing, etc.) but after 4 kids, we come to trust this brand. And the price from Amazon subscription is great too."
4,Good diapers,"We've used pampers for our son and our daughter. For the most part, we haven't had many issues with leaking or fit, until recently. Our son has had a few blow outs but it may be time to move to 4s."
1,Surprisingly Poor Quality,"We use a lot of diapers and frequently go back and forth between Pampers and Huggies as our child grows. Our 18 month-old son definitely wears size 4 but this version of Pampers seems slightly too small. Worse, the stick-on flaps are much less sticky than most diapers we use. Several times his diaper has actually come loose because the flap unsticks during the night resulting in a wet boy. Not sure if this was just a bad batch or there is something different with this particular model. We have not had problems with other Pampers in the past."
1,"Terrible product, leaks over half the time","We ran out of Earths Best and so I got some of these at Walgreens to hold us over. I am simply shocked that these diapers leak very badly over half the time. I was expecting these to perform better than Earths Best simply because they've been in business for so much longer and can use all the fancy chemicals. That was not the case at all. I can't believe these diapers are still on the market. It's like they have holes in them. Our son does like the Elmo image, though."
4,Have the diapers changed?,"I was using Huggies Little Movers for awhile until they were out of stock of my daughters size so I decided to use Baby Dry. I've used them before and I don't remember them being this cheaply made and flimsy. Honestly, if I had my eyes closed and touched them, I would have mistaken them for Luvs. Not that there is anything wrong with Luvs because the price is so cheap, but I expect the quality to be better for Baby Dry diapers."
1,Worst diaper,"This is a worst diaper I ever used for my kids. I bought this just to try , because of its price. This diaper is like a tissue paper. easily tear"
4,Good product,"As good as expected!! The only con is that it is supposed to fit babies from 17 to 25 pounds but my baby is only 18 pounds and it's already snug. Need to change to next size, other than that very good."
3,not what I expected,"It might be good for some babies. But I find pamper swaddlers better, which is softer and has a line that can indicate whether the baby peed or not."
5,soft and very nice,"i love these diapers, also they are at a great price. they leak at night sometimes if the baby pees tons of times, which is very normal."
3,Diaper has had some problems,"Overall this is a great diaper, I always buy Pampers or Huggies and have been satisfied. However this latest box my baby has been wearing the top seam has split on 3 separate occations getting gooey gel all over her belly and clothes. I don't know if you have ever seen the inside material of a diaper but it is really wierd stuff and hard to clean up. I will continue to buy Pampers brand but I think this box might have some manufacture defects."
2,"Lots of leaks, not the same as Dry Max","BEWARE!!! Just because the box looks like Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max Diapers, these are NOT the same. My son is now 5 mo. old and we've been using Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max diapers since he was born (you know, with the blue wetness indicator on the front). However, these are NOT Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max. These are thinner, do not have the woven material inside the diaper and are not nearly as absorbent as the Swaddlers. My son has leaked out of his diaper the last 5 nights... these diapers simply are not absorbent enough to contain a night's worth of pee. We rarely had this problem with Dry Max. I won't be buying these again- they simply aren't worth the very little cost savings."
1,Terrible!,"We went from Swaddlers Sensitive to Baby Dry and were so disappointed after less than a week that we gave them away and went back to the Swaddlers. First of all not only did they leak urine (EVERY night woke up soaked) but even during the day when I changed my four month old's diaper after only a couple of hours his skin was very damp. Now he's never had a diaper rash, and all Ive ever used to keep him dry were the swaddler and baby powder but with these diapers I started using desitin just to keep the urine off his skin. They also couldnt hold in his poops. EVERY time he pooped (not exaggerating) it was a complete blow out, down his legs, up the back of his clothes. We NEVER had this problem with the Swaddlers. I also have to agree with the post about them being too thin, feeling recycled and rough against babys skin. The Swaddlers are MUCH better."
3,Does the job,I have not had to many leaks with them so that makes me happy. I do not like the way they droop at the bottom after he potties. It starts to look like it will drag on the ground. No other diaper has done this. He always looks like I haven't changed him all day.So yes it does the job but looks are less then desirable.
2,Baby Dry = Leaks!,"We tried Pampers Baby Dry on vacation and our had leaks at least once and up to four times per day! Our one year old baby is a size 3 and doesn't have any problems in swaddlers, cruisers or other store brand diapers. I couldn't believe how leaky these were!"
1,poor,"I was not happy with pampers diapers. I was using huggies before and after I switched to pamper, there were more leakage accidents. Plus the side wings broke couple of time while putting on diapers. So overall I was not happy with the pampers this product. I had used pampers with my first child few years ago and they were fine."
4,Lots of Diapers,You definitely get a a ton of diapers with this purchase and the price is pretty good when other retailers aren't having diaper sales. The diapers keeps my baby dry especially over night.
1,Terrible diapers,"This baby dry diaper is supposed to be used for longer duration at nights. Out of the 5 diapers I have used, the gel balls from 2 of them burst and spread all over the house. I have been using the pampers swaddlers and the pampers cruisers but never had issues with them. I will never buy the pampers "" baby dry"" diapers again."
5,Only disposable that's ever worked for us!,"I mostly use cloth diapers during the day, but for overnight and going out, I go with disposables. We're on our 3rd baby now, and over the years Pampers has been the ONLY disposable diaper that we can rely on! Have tried cheaper brands sometimes - they're cheaper for a reason! Pampers has consistently given us a diaper that we can count on not leaking. Store brands, Luvs, Huggies have all failed us multiple times, just leak really bad or tear easily. I am rarely brand-loyal, but Pampers is now the only brand of disposable I'll buy. Pampers is a good quality disposable for the times that you need it (I still recommend using mostly cloth and more natural products though!)"
4,Good product,"This dipers are really good.. They are good for the night too, as good as the diapers that are made specialy for the night.."
1,Poop leaks out the back,As soon as I got these diapers I was surprised at how light and thin they were and I was also worried about the absorbent pad not running all the way to the back. The next day my fears were realized and I got poop all over my shorts. It leaked right out the back. These diapers have a cheap look to them and they perform that way too. I still have about 240 of these left so it will be a long month! My wife thought it was pretty funny though.
3,Pampers,I normally buy Costco brand diapers but since I have a good coupon for Pampers at Amazon thought I would give them a go. Fine for the day but my 17month old girl leaks in them at night. She only takes an 8 oz bottle before bed. I think I will stick with Costoc brand or Huggies for future purchases.
3,"Highly Scented, can sag","I guess I got used to using the 7th Generation diapers because the scent of these is to much. I understand covering up diaper odors is good, but the amount of fragrance in these is overwhelming to me.If the diaper filled about half way or more with liquid the filling tended to break up horizontally in the back, which made for a very saggy look.Didn't have any out of the ordinary issues with leakage and decent fit."
2,Not impressed,"My husband bought these by accident and I was glad to see them go. We normally use Pampers Swaddlers and Pampers Baby-Dry do not come close to comparing.While using these, my daughter had a few accidents (I will be fair and say that a couple of those could have been as a result of human error) and they do not appear to be nearly as durable.Unfortunately, I would not feel comfortable recommending these... spend the extra money and go for the Swaddlers."
1,Pampers Swaddlers are MUCH BETTER!,"I made the huge mistake of buying the baby dry after reading through the reviews. I thought that for the price, why not try them. What a huge mistake! I should have just bought a smaller amount to try them first. Instead we have been using these for over a month now and I have had to clean up a poop spill at least every other day. My baby was 4 months old when we started using these and since she is not eating solids yet, the poop is pretty runny. The baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on. It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the Swaddlers from now on. Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Swaddlers or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SWADDLERS!!"
2,Not as advertised!,"I used to use the more expensive Pampers Cruisers but thought I'd try the Baby-Dry to save some money. I bought a pack at a local store first to make sure the fit and performance was good. I liked them just fine. Nice stretchy tabs, much like the Cruisers. So I ordered from Amazon. I ordered three cases to take advantage of a promotion Amazon was running. But the diapers I received must be old stock, before Pampers put the ""flex"" stretchy sides on the Baby-Dry diapers. The older expiration dates on the Rewards code confirms this. Maybe they've gotten rid of the old stock; then those newer diapers would rate 4.5 stars. These non-flex diapers barely close to fit my baby whereas the flex ones were plenty big. It irks me that Amazon posts a picture of the ""flex"" diapers and delivers a different,inferior product."
2,"Swaddlers are awesome, Baby Dry are awful","I love Pamper's Swaddlers. I've tried Huggies and both Pampers brands, and out of all of them Swaddlers are my favorite. That being said, the Baby Dry diapers are terrible. With Swaddlers you can adjust the fit, and the diapers are really soft. Baby Dry diapers feel like they're recycled and and I really dislike the sticky waist straps. They're shorter so you can't adjust the fit as easily, and the waist is always loose--with a boy that's a very bad idea because he tends to get his clothes wet through the TOP of the diaper instead of the sides now. I can't wait until we use these up because I will never buy Baby Dry again."
2,Going Back to Huggies,"I signed up for these with the subscription purchase because they were slightly cheaper than the Huggies. We are not happy with them at all. They don't seem to hold as much, which is a problem for overnight. You also have to be careful how you position them on your child so they don't leak. When I used swaddlers for my son as an infant, I thought this was a great brand, but the Baby Dry are definitely NOT of the same quality. We will continute to use these during the day until they are gone, but I will not by them again."
2,"2 kids, but first time using Pampers","This is my first time using Pampers. I've used them consistently for almost a month. Is it just me or do they seem to be soaking wet ALL the time. I put them on my daughter and an hour later it's soaked and needs to be changed. Unless I can them for free again, I wouldn't purchase again."
1,Pampers Baby Dry Size 2,"I bought these for my 5 month old because I thought they would be as good as the Swaddlers since Pampers are the best diapers, but I was sadly mistaken. The Baby Dry diapers would leak after only 1 hour of being used. It seemed like the urine would be collected in the front by the turqoise lining, but once it was full, it would bubble up & leak. One night I had to change the crib sheets twice....these diapers were a nightmare!!! Never again would I buy these."
4,Good Diapers,"I use these diapers for my baby, and they work really well for us. They fit her better than the other brands that we have tried, and we have had only a little bit of trouble with leaking, but that has been almost only at night, and with very soggy diapers. They are very soft and absorbent, and I think that it is easier to tell whether the diaper is dirty with Pampers than with other brands, such as Huggies. My daughter and I are both happy with these diapers and will not be switching any time soon."
4,Funny when its runny,"I used pampers swaddlers for my newborn and loved it. Later, I switched to pampers dry max size 2 which seemed to work fine for my baby. However, I am not a big fan of pampers baby dry size 3 for my 4.5 month old baby. The runny poop leaks from the back sometimes although the diaper has been able to sustain pee wetness overnight. Sadly, I will be trying other brands for the next size."
1,No waistband!,These diapers do not have a stretchy wastband. Poop frequently runs up my childs back!!! I will never use these diapers again because of all the extra laundry and mess they created for me.
2,bad pampers,"I have used pampers primarily since my son was born. THIS box has REALLY disappointed me!! More often than not the left side tab TEARS OFF as I am putting it on, which then makes the diaper USELESS!! I called pampers and they sent me a $5 coupon, BUT more than 50 of these diapers has been wasted!! I don't think i will EVER order this again!!"
1,Very bad product from Pampers,its very bad diaper from Pampers.. It wont keep dry more than 2 hours.. during night i have to change my kids diaper 3 times.. thats being very worst thing.i bought new diaper for my kid.. i stop using this diaper.. i am totally unhappy with this pamper product.
2,Baby dry diapers are NOT for us.,"I decided to try the cheaper Pampers Baby Dry instead of my usual Pampers Cruisers. I figured there couldn't be much of a difference, but boy there sure was! I HATE the Baby Dry diapers! Every time my son urinates there is such a strong pee smell that I assume he has peed right through the diaper. However, I check him, and it's not through the diaper - it just smells like it! I can't stand that! I've never had a diaper perform like this one does. I WON'T be ordering this kind again, that's for sure!"
3,Not Great,"I had used these diapers before and wasn't too impressed. They are cheaper than the ones I usually get, so I decided to try them again. I should have gone with my first instincts. The ""baby dry"" formula leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion. They are flimsy and not all that absorbent. They might be good for newborns, but they can't seem to handle a toddler-sized ""potty."" They also might work if you change your kid like every hour, or are using them for back-up during potty-training. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend them. Now I have to use up 200 of them - I don't want to give them away if I wouldn't use them myself - since I got them through subscribe and save and ordered a big box. Lesson learned."
4,smells good,Wipes smells good. They come out of the dispensor great. They are a little on the thin side. I would buy again.
1,What a disappointment,"After reading the baby dry reviews, I bought a pack of 228--BIG MISTAKE! They feel ultra soggy after 2 hours (the other brands do not) and I can't even go without changing her after her early morning feeding. When we do change her, it seems like the diaper isn't wicking the moisture away properly as she seems a little damp (yes, even after just 2 hours). I'm dissatisfied that the box says 12 hour protection, when it really maxes out at about 4 hours. Even my husband asked me why I bought the crappy brand :( We absolutely love the swaddlers and swaddlers sensitive--they both make it through the night (anywhere from 8-12 hours) for my 3 month old daughter. I'm a little disappointed in Pampers right now because we have loved all their other products, but now I feel like I'm stuck with 200+ diapers that I paid for and probably won't use."
3,Pampers,"The papers were working fine until the last box I received, my baby has been pooping out of them :("
5,great diaper,"I have been ordering this for my baby girls. Once tried other brands, but never satisfied until using this one. This is a high quality diaper. Amazon is a great place for shopping diaper since it is free shipping."
4,Best quality and value for the price,"We have used Pampers and Huggies diapers since our daughter was born. While we love Pampers' Swaddler line of diapers since they are so soft, Baby Dry is a lot more economical. Still a great diaper and if put on correctly, does not leak and can absorb a lot! And with Amazon's subscribe and save feature, getting these diapers is super convenient and a great deal."
4,Satisfied with these diapers,"I am very picky when it comes to diapers and I love these diapers! No blow-outs and they were cheaper than buying generic Target Brand diapers! Although I do prefer the Pampers Swaddlers over most diapers, these Baby-Dry held up as well for being much cheaper. Very easy to order off amazon.com, came quickly and free shipping, and inexpensive diapers! Excellent Deal!"
3,Pampers Snug and Dry,"I got a great deal on this box of diapers using the code from Parents Magazine and joining Amazon's Mom's Club, but sadly, my baby leaked through these every night. We had to wear a Pamper's Cruiser each night. But for daytime diapers, it was a good deal!"
1,Diaper rash galore,My baby was extremely sore after using one of these diapers for just one day. I am sending my order back because of this. No wonder it was such a great price!
5,Keeps Kids Dry,We have 4 boys and all of them have used Pampers as they are the only ones that we have found that do not leak for them. The price is wonderful on here as well using Amazon Mom and Subscribe and Save.
2,Leaky,My baby wakes up everyday with wet clothes in front! Not something we have every had in the past 13 mo's with other brand diapers. Would not buy these diapers again. The fabric is soft and the diaper is not stiff I do like the texture and overall feel but when the baby is waking up wet and mad this needs to be addressed. Defiently not Baby dry! Overall not satisfied.
1,Most of the diapers strap are useless,Most of the diapers' strap are glued to diaper itself such a way that you cannot use those diapers. I am just throwing away lots of diapers without using it...
5,Excellent diaper,"I'm now a mom of twin boys and I have an older daughter. I like other diapers as well but for different reasons. I've used Pampers, Huggies, Babies R Us brand, Seventh Generation, Luvs, Target Brand, and many more.My daughter has always been a bit larger in the hip size and I recommend both the Pampers Baby dry and Huggies. Now, that she is older and almost potty trained we still use these in size 5 and they fit great and hold everything in. She can even put these diapers on all by herself! I like the fact that you can get size 5 for $.14 a piece via Subscribe and Save and using Amazon Mom for free shipping. This is the best deal!"
3,no wetness indicator,"Unlike the ones we got at the hospital and Babies 'R Us, these didn't have the wetness indicator--the yellow line that turns blue when the baby pees--which was a disappointment. I think the Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers size 1 still has it (at least according to the amazon description http://www.amazon.com/Pampers-Swaddlers-Sensitive-Diapers-180-Count/dp/B001651192/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=hpc&qid;=1284753490&sr;=1-1.)Also, it says N fits up to 10 lbs., but as size 1 is for 8lbs-14 lbs, may be better to stock up on those. Our girl is 8lbs and the N size already seems a bit snug on her."
1,Pampers chemicals=rash,I tried all the different diapers before converting to cloth pocket diapers. We used these Pampers for a few months before swearing off disposables completely. Pampers don't hold leaks and are filled with so many chemicals that they gave my baby a rash. I felt horrible about using something that filled up the trash so fast!
1,Terrible for #2,"Terrible poop control. Spills right out the sides and back. Absorbent for urine only, would not recommend this product. Swaddlers are much softer, and much more absorbent,I have not had any spillage events with swaddlers."
2,NOT perfume sensitive baby friendly,I know many people swear by Pampers and I did find their fit to be very pleasing BUT both of my children had significant allergic reactions to the light scenting added to these diapers. For parents of babies with sensitive skin these may not be the diapers for you.
2,Good,I like the price and quantity in the package but I'm noticing now that they are holding up overnight. I've recently changed to a more absorbent diaper at night.
1,Does NOT stay DRY!,Every single night my 11 month old daughter would wet through these diapers and get her sheets completely wet! HORRIBLE buy in my opinion!
1,Exploding diapers,"Our daughter is 6 months old and 19 lbs. She has been wearing these size 3 Pampers, and we wake up to exploded diapers many mornings, with little gel beads all over DD. I'm switching to Huggies overnight, based on a co-worker's recommendation."
1,Huggies are better . . .,"I, like many other reviewers, fell into the trap of buying these because they were going for a great price. My son had been wearing Huggies size 3, but I thought these might be worth a try. My husband and I now have a joke that our son has been crawling in the cobwebs again. These diapers fall apart and the fibers look like little spiderwebs hanging off his little bum. Sometimes we find our son plucking the ""webs"" off his diaper like someone plucking a chicken. I would not recommend these diapers, especially for active babies."
2,I really want to like it,"I really want to like it. It is certainly better than the Huggies I bought before but the quality is no where close to the pamper's cruiser we have been using. It is good if you knew you will change diaper frequently as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. I haven't run into any leaking issue yet as I now use it only when I knew my baby will not stay with it for long. We use it as temporary diaper that is why I still give it a two star rating. It is cheaper for more diapers, you get what you paid for."
2,No leaks but stinky and saggy...,I used this diaper for my 2 year old and once she urinated in it once it would sag half way down her leg. Also when I used them at night come morning they would smell so bad that her pajama pants and even sheets smelled of urine. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because they never leaked even when very full.
2,Poor Quality Diapers,"I have used a wide variety of diapers (Huggies, Earth's Best, Target) and these by far are the poorest quality. They have a low threshold as far as how much liquid it can hold before they start to leak. My daughter wakes up completely wet whenever she is wearing Pampers, but not when she's wearing another brand. In addition, the tape on these diapers is not great, so the diaper often comes undone by itself, which can create quite a mess at an inopportune time."
5,Baby Dry stays DRY overnight!!,Pampaers is my go to diaper and the Baby Dry keeps my baby dry thru the night! Extremely pleased with the product and the pricing on Amazon Mom!!
1,Baby Dry Runs Very Small,I moved my daughter up from a size 1 Pampers Sensitive to the size 2 Baby Dry. The diapers are the exact same size. We have a blow-out every BM. I am so mad right now. How can the sizing be so off? I am stuck with two big boxes now of diapers I cannot use.
5,"great price, quality and to the door service","I have shopped around and this is the best deal for the top quality diapers out there. The time of the free delivery of the diapers from Amazon varies with my two orders. The first time it took a couples of weeks and the second time it arrived in a couple of days. So you should plan ahead to order these big package diapers. But in my opinion, it is well worth it!"
3,Misleading Sample,"I got a sample of this diaper sent to me by Pampers, and I absolutely loved it - so soft and luxurious, it was the perfect diaper. The problem? I loved it so much that I went out to buy a big pack, only to discover that the actual product was not as soft nor as smooth as the sample. I was VERY disappointed, and honestly, felt kind of cheated."
3,bulk diapers not so good,this is our third child. We have been using Pampers diapers (same brand). These diapers are much lower quality compared to a few years ago.
4,Runs small,"I always get size 4 for my little guy, and so I ordered size 4 in Pampers Baby-Dry. I can barely fit them around his waist. My friend and I compared Pampers size 3 and 4 next to each other and we couldn't tell any size difference."
4,baby diapers,"I tried Cruisers and Pampers and Huggies. Huggies Supreme leaked. The only two that did the job were Cruisers and Paprer Baby Dry Diapers. Unfortunatelly Cruisers overpriced although they fit the best. Baby Drys does the job with a more appropriate price tag, but their fit is poorly designed"
4,Best diapers we've used so far,"No diaper is perfect, that's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. These are however the best we've used so far (and we've used quite a lot of different brands and types). Fewer blow-outs and seems to hold a lot of pee overnight. Thumbs up :)"
5,Love Pampers Diapers,I love pampers diapers. we tried all brands including some store brands and these were by far my favorite. my child will always be a pampers baby
2,LEAKS GALORE!,"These diapers crack and leak all over! On the bright side however, baby never has a rash with these. So they keep her bum dry and her onesies soaked. hmmmm... Is there a happy medium?"
2,"If you like changing sheets, buy these!","I'm a first time mom of a baby boy. I've tried many different kinds of diapers on my son. Pamper's Baby Dry are the worst I've used. They don't hold much at all! I've been lucky and my little man sleeps through the night, but these diapers can't stand up to that (even when he was only 2 months old)! Every night they leaked. I couldn't stand it. I had to buy a different kind of diaper to use at night time until that package of baby dry was gone. My favorite diapers have to be either Pamper's Swaddlers, or Huggies Supreme Natural Fit. The only thing is, the Huggies seem to run a little bit smaller than the Pampers."
3,Not thick enough,"Pamers makes good diapers but it's not thick enough to last overnight for my girls. When I change their diapers first thing in the morning, their diapers are full and their pajama pants are wet. I think I need to switch back to Huggies diapers for their last diaper change before they go to bed."
4,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Review,"The product has been arrived on time and was good. The price what I was expected, competitive with other providers. I would love to continue with amazon for my baby diaper needs and toys as well."
4,Softer and More Comfortable,"These diapers are softer and more compact than the Costco brand I have been using. My son doesn't scratch his waist when he's wearing these. Unfortunately, they don't seem to hold as much as the Costco brand so we have had a few wetness accidents. My son likes to drink A LOT of water. I just have to change him a little more often when he is wearing these diapers."
1,Awful-chemical smell,"I have solely been a pampers mom but after buying these I'm thinking of trying something new.The diapers reeked of chemicals, very unhappy and very upset that I had 246 to go through. I will not buy diapers online again, at least not these."
3,"Diaper quality issues, Damaged carton package","The product quality has detiorated over the past one year. We have been using Pampers ever since my baby girl started using diapers. Of late, there has been several instances where the diaper does not hold up enough liquid as it used to, it wets the pants very often. I am unhappy with the shipments coming from Amazon too, the carton packages are most damaged when it arrives. Does not make me feel safe although the diapers are protected with the plastic foil inside. The price point is good, which is the only positive aspect to mention."
5,love,Pampers baby dry is the only brand that works for my baby... them keep her dry and we have never had leaks!
3,not a bad diaper,"i'm not a fan of the baby powder scent. when this box arrived smelling like baby powder, it just made me groan. i don't understand why diaper makers insist on putting the fragrance in the diaper. i guess its because they think that we would appreciate something to mask the smell of the contents going in the diaper. i just think it makes it worse. otherwise the diaper is not too bad but it was definitely a little more leaky than some others that i've tried."
3,"Good price, good product","Overall the Pampers Baby Dry diapers are pretty good. They are a good price compared to Swaddlers or Cruisers. The big bummer is that I find the tabs don't stick well & tend to come undone at times, creating leaks. I used to get these from the Amazon Warehouse Deals, as they were a good price, but the customer service is HORRIBLE. I was sent a box that had been urinated on (I'm guessing by a dog) and returned to Amazon. They then sent it out as a Warehouse Deal. I don't need diapers that have already been pee'd on!"
1,"They leak, stink, and cause rashes","People kept telling me to try Pampers because they hold a lot of pee. We primarily use cloth diapers and our cloth diapers work well for nighttime (11 hours) but sometimes I just hate waking up to that ammonia stink. I decided to try some different kinds of disposables to see if I could find a brand that would work all night without a change. We tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature, and they work off and on. I thought I would finally give some Pampers a try and see if the package was right. It says these are good for 12 hours. Not for us! They leak worse than the chlorine-free disposables and stink like powder. My son's closet (where these are stored) now has a stinky powdery smell. Some people might like this smell, but to me it smells bad. I decided to use them up by using them during the day and they gave my son a horrible rash.Never. Again."
2,"bad fit, many ""blow outs""","I don't know if this a ""2nds"" product. When the same product was bought at Target, the fit was great, no leaking, no blowouts. When bought through Amazon....nothing but problems. The only reason delivery continued is because I forgot to terminate it, then my baby was on to a different size."
4,Pampers are my favorite,"I've used many diapers on my kids (huggies, kirklands, Target before it was up & up, and cloth) and Pampers are my favorite. I love the soft exterior and how light and thin it is. The other diapers absorb just the same, but how they're made causes them to curl up and that's very inconvenient during a dirty diaper change. Pampers never curl and absorb just as much. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my twins do need their special night diapers or they leak through their PJ's. I was so happy when I found Pampers night diapers the other day though."
2,"Not so ""Dry"" !",I bought these daipers but they are not very absorbent. I got some from the hospital when We were discharged those daipers were awsome. I had the same problem with my first baby and I had t go find those pamper daipers from target. The price is very good on Amazon but I am not very pleased with the product. It doesnt absorb much and then the baby is wet and in winter changing clothes frequently for new born is not fun.
5,Great diapers,"I have been using these diapers for my daughter for almost a year now. They are excellent and I almost never have any issues with leakes. I use them both daytime and night. With Prime shipping, they are at my door so quick. Its very convenient, and the box lasts for a month!"
3,Not as good as it used to be,"I have a 12 year old that I religiouly used pampers brand diapers on, now that I have another baby I am surprise to find out that the quality has change for the worse. Simply put their quality is not what it used to be."
4,Much better than Cruisers Dry Max!!!,I bought a box of pampers dry when it was on sale at Amazon.com + 15% desc subscribe and save. It was really worth! Very convenient to shop on the confort of our home and have it delivered to our door in no time!
2,leaks,The baby dry diaper is not as good as swaddlers for leakage proof performance. It leaks quite frequently from the back side. One reason may be that my baby has some gas issue. But the swaddlers worked much better to prevent leakage by adding thicker layer on the back. I should have bought it even with the little additional cost. So be warned if you do not want to wash baby cloth that often.
3,More Leaks Than Pampers Swaddlers,"I have used both Pampers Baby Dry and Swaddlers for my newborn. Baby Dry diapers puff up like a marshmallow when they are wet making it very easy to tell when it is time to change baby. Stage 1 seems to be a different size for the two styles with Baby Dry less roomy than the Swaddlers style. I have never had a leak with Swaddlers but with Baby Dry the liquid poop keeps shooting up the back of the diaper and onto baby's clothes. Other than the leaks, the ruffled edges that keep contents inside the diaper often fold inside and I have to manually pull them out after changing baby. If I forget to do that the diapers aren't sealed properly and poop has a way to get outside of the diaper around the leg area as well. With Pampers Swaddlers the ruffled edges are always properly aligned."
1,LEAKS !!!,"I AM SO DISSAPOINTED WITH THE NEW BABY DRY DIAPERS .I have been using Pampers cruisers for my son and have rarely had any leakage ..Maybe an occassional leak which is not bad.I was happy with Pampers.I decided to give ""Baby Dry"" a try bcos it claimed to have a more absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I am sooo disappointed. The core seems to be WAAAAAYYY inferior to the Cruisers core and leaks !! I started using them a few days back and my son has woken up atleast 5 nights crying bcos he was soaking wet !! :(This morning I was holding him and my shirt felt wet. The diaper was leaking and it went thru his clothes onto mine !! So its not just about night time leaks. So much for absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I was better off with my tried and trusted Cruisers.NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD CASE OF LEAKS WITH CRUISERS .......WILL NEVER USE BABY DRY DIAPERS AGAIN.I hope Pampers is not dropping its quality :("
1,Not so Baby Dry,"At first we tried Pampers swaddlers, and they were great except that my baby developed a diaper rash when using them. We switched to Baby Dry, and the rash went away. However, they consistantly leaked whenever he was on his side while nursing. About 10 times I have ended up with a wet lap.Also, they do not fit very well, as they have no stretch around the waist. We switched to Huggies and they are wonderful. They haven't ever leaked and they stretch around the legs and waist."
1,The diapers actually FALL APART.,"Every night we put our 1 year old in one of these diapers, and most mornings he wakes up not just leaky, but with the seams of the diaper opened up and the absorbent material all over his clothes and skin! But since we bought so many we have had to keep using them and dealing with this disgusting problem day after day.They are fine during the day, when we change him fairly often. But during the 12 hour night time they are useless. Huggies leak too, but at least they don't explode."
4,new diaper mom,Find that this is a good product. Have not had any concerns. Seem to not leak. Prefer over Huggies brand. Would purchase again.
2,Not the improved style!,"I ordered several boxes of these and was very disappointed to find that these are not the improved ""flex"" kind. I only switched from cruisers to the baby dry because they were stretchy. Now I have several boxes of diapers that barely fit."
3,"Not bad, but prefer Cruisers","After using Pampers Cruisers we tried to save a few bucks with the Baby-Dry diapers. They are noticeably thinner, but provided good coverage. We had one accident early on, but I'll chalk that up to our error in securing the diaper because it never happened again. The reason why we won't use these again is because unlike the Cruisers these are not scented. It's a subtle difference, but it makes all the difference between a tiny tinkle smelling like an open sewer and being non-offensive."
1,Horrible!,"I won't use these again! They kept falling apart and the gel crystals went everywhere! They got all over my toddlers bed!!! I change his diaper every couple of hours, there is no way these could be used for 12 hours to keep your baby dry. I'm never buying pampers again, horrible experience with these."
2,Not a good NIGHT diaper...Son wakes up wet... ALWAYS,I use Pampers during the day and have to switch to Huggies for our night diaper...My son is 17 months and every other morning he wakes with a leaky diaper :o( Clothes soaked...bed soaked....I sent my last box back.
2,stupid shipping,"good price, but stupid shippingthey couldn't deliver this item, and the order returned.they refunded only part of money and i paid and i lost all saved money of online order because of this unexpected returnyou should be careful when ordering something online"
1,Amazon is very very slow in Shipping/Delivery for Diapers,"Amazon says the delivery is within 24 hours for diapers when you look at the item.After placing the order, it always gives the shipping date atleast 2 to 3 weeks after palcing order. You child may go the next size by the time you receive the box.Please order the next size if you ever order diapers from Amazon."
2,Blown out back door!!!!,I got these diapers for my retarted uncle. He suffered a kick to the head from a horse at 15 when he was trying to shave his back end. Ever Sence my uncle has been unable to do basic bodly functions. So we put these on him after we hose him down. He just loves the feel on his chaped hairless hair. Saddly to say tho after a night with a hungry man meal my poor uncle blew the ass end out of these diapers! The smell was terrable and my Dad had to get the hose and not only beat my uncle he also had to hose down our poor cat. I called up the manufactor trying to get them to pay for the damages. They refused!!!!
1,I do NOT like pampers AT ALL,"I use these for my son, at night since he is potty trained during the day! He has woken up wet, WAY too many times, which means he is wet AND his bed! This has NEVER happened with Luvs...they are SOO much better of a diaper and cheaper too! All pamper has going for them is their name!"
1,Never Again,"I decided to try these diapers instead of the swaddlers to save a few dollars. Needless to say that was a mistake. They claim to keep baby dry for up to 12 hours. My little one can't use these to sleep through the night (6 hours). I don't recommend these at all. Spend a few extra dollars on the swaddlers, you'll make your money back on the $ saved on extra laundry they cause because they leak."
5,"convenience, convenience, convenience","i love subscribe and save!!! i never buy diapers or wipes at the store anymore! and of course, great value!!!"
3,"OK, but have to change more often than other diapers","These diapers are ok for the price. We've thankfully never had a poo leak, but these will leak urine if left on longer than a couple of hours. Forget about even trying to use them overnight! I made the mistake of putting one on my son before he went to bed and he woke up in the middle of the night screaming because he was soaked. Luvs are cheaper and seem to hold liquid better. I'd probably choose those over the Pampers Baby Dry, but we will use up the ones we have left since they are just fine for daytime wear, when the child will be changed more frequently."
1,Leaky diaper...cheap - use Cruisers instead!,"I decided to buy this over the cruisers since i'd save a few dollars and get a few extra diapers at the same time. Unfortunately, this diaper would fall apart in my hands as I opened it to put it on my son. In addition, my son would leak. So i decided to go back to the cruisers and have been happy since. No more leaky diapers."
3,Not very 'baby dry',"I tried these because it says Baby Dry on the box and my 1 year old floods these and all his bedding by morning. So, I don't really care for them."
3,Economical,"I like this product because it absorbs well. However, the quality of the product is not that consistent. The strap may not be very strong, and the whole thing might just come off, making it not functional. Also, out of the 6 boxes we bought, one smells terrible"
1,"good price, bad quality","I buy these diapers through subscribe and save, so they come out at reasonable price. BUT the quality is not good enough. My daughter is a pretty good pooper and these diapers spil all the time! I have to change her clothes or wash sheets and mattress cover every day! The money I save on diapers i spend on detergent, energy and water.Huggies are so much better!"
5,Best diapers for us,"I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand, they didn't work as well (tabs not restickable, not as absorbent, etc) and we went back to Pampers. I discovered Baby Dry because we were in Mexico and that was the type of Pampers they had in the Costco there - baby dry is great - they are thin and super absorbent. Amazon is the best place to buy them - especially if you use subscribe and save."
3,Mom from Austin TX,"I ordered size 4 baby dry. But it was the old baby dry that doesn't have the flexible tabs. when I ordered it the page showed the diaper box with the flexible tabs feature. However, I got the old baby dry diaper without flexible tabs which is a little bit too tight for my baby."
3,Pampers Baby Dry,It did it's job. The only con I saw was that it sometimes left a white residue on my daughter.
4,A Marked Reduction in Leaks,"Another reviewer mentioned that Pampers are the best for long, skinny babies. That's what I have, and I can vouch for these being much better than the Huggies that the hospital sent home with us. My son managed to pee out of those without hardly touching the diaper. I have no idea how he did it. These diapers were much better, although they weren't totally blow-out-proof. Now that he has grown out of the Newborn size and into size 1, I am still using the Pampers Baby Dry, and I think they do the job just fine, although if there is a diaper that is 100% leak-proof, I would love to know what it is."
5,Great Diapers for my Little Guy!,"This product is a good value, and Pampers Baby Dry work best for my son. They don't leak, despite the fact he is a super wetter, and I love the Caterpillar Flex sides. Cute Sesame Street designs as well."
1,AWFUL,"These have to be the worst diapers I have ever bought! Waste of money, useless at night, they leak and smell after being worn for just a short period of time. Seventh Generation are by far the best I've used and will continue to do so, don't know what I was thinking buy these"
4,slow shipping,"I've always loved pampers and this was such a great deal so I jumped on it. Everything came and all was good, but it took 2 weeks for the shipment to get to my home. In that time I had to buy another pack of diapers. All of my other amazon shipments usually only take a few days, maybe a week. I just do.t understand why this one took so long. Besides that things were fantastic."
1,Zero Stars - These leak!,"These are terrible for night use. We used them at night for a week, and they leaked at least half of the nights. Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive are much better."
1,Diapers arrived pre-used,"It seems virtually impossible to just contact Amazon and tell them there was a problem with my order without writing a review or packing up the diapers in the huge box, printing out a mailing label and returning them. The diapers I've been ordering monthly (Subscribe and Save) for a long time came and when I opened the plastic packing, they appeared to have been pre-wet. They had that crunchy, beady texture that diapers get when they are exposed to water. Of course, the whole reason I have them on order monthly is because I need them regularly and these came just in time-- I had run out of diapers. I have 3 kids, 3 and under and I can't easily get to the store to get more diapers so I had to use these gross diapers on my daughters AND now I have to return them to get a refund?? Something is broken with this system."
1,Worst diapers EVER!!!!!!!!,"These diapers literally FALL APART at night. Even with my son who has a pretty servere case of urine reflux (not all his urine fliters out) and these diapers decingrate(sp) This morning I spend almost 30 minutes trying to clean off the little gel balls of the diaper material off my son and changing table!! So if you have a baby that can sleep through the night and you don't want to spend 30 minutes at the changing station, spend a couple extra dollars and buy the pampers extra protection, or HUGGIES!!!"
1,Please be carefull when subscribing amazon account,I am a amazon customer since Aug2010 but i never had this kind of experience that my account is charged several times in a month and same product is dumped into my home.When check with the customer care they are saying i might hit the button several times so my subscription duplicated and hence i am receiving the same product multiple time.I don't know how it is possible.Finally i am able to cancel my account.So be care full when you are subscribing and check you account(credit/debit) attached to the subscription frequently.
1,So frustrated using Baby Bry!!!,"Now it is 6:00 am, Saturday. I'm so mad and just find this page to write this review. Yesterday was the second day we use Pamper Baby Dry and we yielded 4 dirty clothes and 2 dirty sheets in last 24 hours. Baby Dry leak terribly!!! It is soooo frustrated to change sheet and cloth at 5am in the weekend.Our baby is 15 days old and 9 and a half pounds today. Never got any problems using other NB or Size1 diapers.I bought a large pack of Baby Dry (252 counts, size 1). There are still about 240 left. For the last ~10 pieces Baby Dry we used, Half of them leaked. Need to figure out of a way to get rid of them."
4,Good diapers with occasional leaks,I was using Pampers Swaddlers when my daughter was a newborn. I found that the baby dry diapers were cheaper than Swaddlers and decided to give them a try. They are not very soft like Swaddlers and are without the indicator strip but they are good and they leak occasionally when she wears them overnight. My daughter is 19 months old now. The shipping is amazingly fast and so I keep ordering them again and again. The price is less when compared to other shopping sites and in stores and it even goes down when Amazon have an e-coupon.
2,Very Thin and leaks,Tried pampers for the first time and it was size 5. It's very Thin and most of the time it leaks from the side when she poops.
1,Online Pampers are poor in Quality,Pampers that I bought online are very poor quality than that are purchased from stores.Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Economy Pack Plus Size 4 192 Count-Jhansi
5,Never disappointed,My daughter is 2 years old and we have always used Panpers. I may spend a little bit more but it is worth it for no leaks - ever!
5,AL,"We always love these diapers, they move well with our 14 month old and don't spill. The large pack makes the price per diaper significantly less, and with shipping right to your door who could ask for a better deal."
2,baby rash..,The price was Great butThis was completely different from what I'm used to. The diapers look different. And ever since I used one.. My baby suffers deA horrible rash. His skin peals off and it has gotten worst over time.
4,pampers review,these diapers do maintain there shape and absorb exceptionally well. They last the night for my 9 month old granddaughter
2,"OK diaper, but not for overnight!!!","This diaper is OK during the day. It is very thin, flimsy, feels really cheap, but it is sufficient to hold a medium-size mess during the day. However, it leaked all over every single night no matter what we tried. I would actually test different diapers every night, and this one would always have the most leaks all over. Cruisers did a bit better, Huggies did as well (actually as bad) as Cruisers...but, still there were leaks every night! If you are used to Swaddlers, be ready for a huge disappointment! This diaper cannot be used overnight. Our boy is 13 months and 24 lbs,and is long. Even tried a size bigger as it was suggested. Had to go back to Swaddlers...size 4 (sensitive-the only type of Swaddlers in 4) and no more leaks! There are never any leaks with Swaddlers!!! Pampers Baby Dry is the worst Pampers diaper I have ever used!!"
2,Gave my baby diaper rash (Size 1),"My 5 month old never had diaper rash until she started using the Pampers baby dry (size 1) she doesn't even sleep for more than 4 hours at a time so she never sat in a diaper for much longer than that. I would never buy these again. In fact, we have tons leftover and I'd rather waste the money than subject my baby to them."
1,pampers baby dry,It gets soggy in no time and leaks out big time . The product has lost its quality .I will never buy it again .
1,Long time user with new problem,"I have been using Baby Drys (via Amazon Mom) on my now 11 mo old for several months with no problems. There has been either an unannounced product change or a problem with this batch of diapers, as my child developed a severe diaper rash. The doctor confirmed it was a contact rash and the only recent change is this new box of diapers. Unfortunately, we'll be switching brands for at least the time being.Despite this problem, Amazon's customer service was great and promptly issued a refund for this product. I was pleased with the service."
4,pretty good diapers,"these are a slight step down from pamper's swaddlers. but they're a little better than cruisers. for the last 4 months or so we've been using costco diapers during the day and baby dry at night. but recently we decided to just use baby dry all the time. these are quality diapers and very absorbent. you can immediately feel the difference between these and costco brand just holding them in your hand. it's worth it even for a little bit more money. but with 'subscribe and save,' free shipping and no tax, it's a total no-brainer."
4,great diapers,"Switched to these after Pampers downgraded their Cruisers. They work very well for us, not to mention they are more affordable than Cruisers too."
5,Fast shipment at a good price,The convenience of ordering diapers and having them delivered free in two days (with Prime shipping) makes me doubt I'll ever go back to buying diapers at the store.
5,Great price!!!,I always search for the cheapest name brand diapers and this is it!!! With the economy the way it is and the bigger the baby gets the less diapers you get this is great!!!! Affordable and they work great!!! I was using the cruisers but I needed to cut down my expenses so this helps some.
2,not so dry....,"Diaper didn't last through the night. My 2 year old woke up multiple times needing to be changed (totally unusual for him). The gel beads inside the diaper became really cold when wet and the diper completely ripped open, allowing the wet, cold gel beads to spill all over the place. I'm going back to my normal pampers and just getting the next size up--hopefully that works."
2,"Great diaper, except the sticky tabs didn't stick.","The diapers are super absorbent and do a great job. Half way through the bag, we noticed that the sticky tabs weren't sticky. The diapers weren't staying on. This could just be a bad batch of diapers with no sticky, but for the cost of diapers, I am not going to take a change on buying another set of diapers. We are sticking with the Pampers Cruisers - love them!"
3,Very good before baby gets 20 lbs,"I have used this from size2-3 for half a year. It has been pretty well for the baby until recently he reached 20 lbs. When he pooped, it seemed that the diaper can't hold it any more and we had to clean the clothes for a few times. we did not have a problem with our daughter who used 3 for a long time. But it seemed that this one is not a good match for baby boy. I am going to try size 4."
5,Pampers > Huggies,We only buy Pampers because of multiple incidents with Huggies and blowouts. The Pampers just feel like better quality.
1,Baby DRY?,I am very unhappy with these diapers. I usually purchase Pampers Cruisers but this was such a good deal and being named BABY DRY! They leak everynight!!
4,Love this diapers,"Pampers Baby Dry are our favorite diapers, we've been together from size 1 to size 6.The only reason why I'm giving this product 4 stars is that within the last 6 months, nearly every box we receive contains few diapers with substandard closures <- the little flaps come right off once you pull them.----On the other hand, we are very impressed with Amazon Mom - it delivers everything it promises, from savings to on-time-delivery."
2,Shipping leaves a lot to be desired,"My review comments apply to Amazon's shipping rather than the product itself. I recently subscribed to Amazon Mom and was rudely surprised to see that my regular two day shipments have started taking almost 10 days to arrive!!I wish Amazon would let us know in advance that they would be stopping the two day free shipping that came with the prime membership, if we enroll ourselves in Amazon Mom. Very disappointing indeed!"
3,"very soft but don't secure well, too much scent","These diapers are very soft and feel comfortable to hand. But they don't secure well. They tend to slide down and create a big mess if you have an active baby. Huggies are the opposite, a little stiff but secure better. So you have to weigh between the two. Personally, I feel the scent is a little too much for babies."
4,Pampers Baby Dry,These work great for my daughter although they seem to run a little small so she grows out of the sizes quick! Leak-proof and she sleeps in them all night!
5,Great diapers!,These diapers have great absorbency.I do not change her diaper in the middle of the night(she sleeps 11 hours)and there are no leaks and no diaper rashes.
4,Very Soft and comfortable,These diapers are very good. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the tabs that easily breaks.
4,Contains leaks!,I use these overnight for my twins and they are awesome! I was wary at how thin they seemed but they rock at holding the urine. The diapers are heavy and full in the morning but the babies and their pajamas are dry. Great diapers!
2,not so great,not so great. She wanted to take it off every 2 seconds and it was a headache. I will be trying same brand different method.
5,love it,my baby stays dry and happy all the time i only use pampers especially the 222 count which is a real value
2,"Better than most, but the leakier of the Pampers family","Pampers Cruisers are the better of the Pampers diapers. I would not recommend this particular type, as they leak. Still better than most..."
3,Not as good as I thought!,"I was using pampers Cruisers with Dry Max for a long time and did some comparisons. I wanted to give the Baby Dry a try since it's still Pampers, but cheaper. Baby Dry did not have the Dry Max, but was softer. After several weeks of use, we have realized that you pay for what you get. The Baby Dry does not hold as much, my son would wake up wet from leakage and many times, his poop would leak out too! Since I ordered 3 boxes trying to save money we only use this diaper during the day and change him more frequently. We purchased more Cruisers with Dry Max and use those when we are out and during the night. If you have a little one who wets a lot during the night, this is not the diaper for you. My son is 14 months and this was just not right."
5,Love pampers!!,I am a mom to 7 kids with our 8th on the way. We have used pampers for years. We trust that they are the best and know from experience that it's worth the money. They are gentle on skin and leak proof! Don't waste time trying any other diapers I have tried them all and nothing compares to pampers quality!
3,Can't stand up throught the night,"These diapers are very economical, but I have found my baby's stomach and chest soak and wet many mornings if he has slept more than 5 hours. I was already excited my 19 wk old was sleeping longer hours, but I constantly had to worry when he cried in the morning because he was hungry or soaked and most of the time he was soaked. Outside of the night sleeps, this diaper was fine, but I had a relative purchase some Huggies while out and those seem to hold up better through the night sleeps and allows me to have some peace when I go to bed."
2,Not a great quality for the money!,"After getting a box of these diapers (all defected), Amazon's great customer service replaced the box with Luvs. The diapers also tend to sag and leak. I really do not recommend them to any mom and I know I wouldn't purchase them again!"
1,I loved the price,The price was great for my twin grandsons. After a month both babies developed a severe rash from the baby dry diapers. Other Mom's have said the same thing. Now they have switched to Huggies.
1,leaked!,"These pampers leaked, one out of five times.Makes changing them much harder.I do not recomend this product to anyone."
4,good as expected!,"As a new mom, I've tried couple of different brands,, and Pampers is the winner. For this specific one, it's great for the cost, but it does not come with wetness indicator... which is something you can live without.. but the ones with it, help quite a bit. But can't complain when you have to change diaper like 12+ times a day, the cost comes as a big player in purchasing such items."
4,Really good diapers...but our favorites are still Luvs,"Pampers Baby Dry and Luvs have been our two go-to brands for our active little guy. For Newborn-thru-2, Pampers were definitely our favorites. But once he hit size three, we've gone with both of these numerous times....and about the only thing we can say for sure is we like both better than Huggies!!! We did get one batch of Pampers about 3 months ago where the elastic tabs would sometimes break or come apart, but Pampers to their credit gave us a refund as well as some half-off coupons that we could use at the local Tarzjay! Probably just a random bad batch or something -- no probs on the others.In the end, it really comes down to cost....and if you compare Pampers vs. Luvs, Luvs ends up being a few cents cheaper per diaper. Given the way the Dems and Republicans are ruining the economy, every cent makes a difference. Hence the reason I'm giving Luvs a 5-star and Pampers a 4-star rating -- both are excellent but Luvs are just a little cheaper!"
3,Allergy Issue,Diapers would be fine for other babies but my daughter had an allergic reaction to these cheaper diapers---I thought I was getting a great deal but this didn't work for her so we ended up gifting them. She does fine with Cruisers and Huggies though. Just an FYI.
2,New Design,"As another reviewer has mentioned, Pampers has changed the design. We also hate the new design, but Amazon has the old design in stock. There's unfortunately no difference at all in the box or product labeling, so I suppose what you get is open to chance."
2,new combo size 1-2 is the worst idea papers has come up with,"these diapers are basicly the same as a size 1 but the problem is that you can't get something comapable to a size 2 , I ordered size 3 after these no longer fit and the things are huge and constantly leak .hope pampers sees this and goes back to old sizing because pampers are the best for leaks etc but this stupid 1-2 combo is insane !!!"
2,go with pampers swaddlers,"I have two main complaints:1. These are not as absorbant as the pampers swaddlers, and since it's a diaper, that's pretty much its main task. I didn't experience any liquid leakage, but solids were problematic. Any more detailed description will probably prevent this review from being published...2. These diapers do not have the wetness indicator lines that are found on the swaddlers. I didn't realize that those lines were so useful until I subscribed to these (used to get them at Target).Anyway, these two reasons are sufficient for me to cancel my subscription after two shipments.This review is by no means related to Amazon's subscription and shipping service. I think Amazon does a fantastic job with that. All shipments arrived before the stated arrival dates with no problems at all!"
3,Exactly like LUVS,"I ordered these after my daughter came home from daycare wearing a pampers diaper, and I loved it. Unfortunaltey, this was not the diaper she came home in. These are plastic and are not worth the money. With the exception of the cute prints, they are exactly like luvs, but a lot more expensive. I like LUVS, but thats not what I wanted/paid for. Also, the diaper I loved so much was actually a pampers cruiser. Which I did end up ordering the next time around. they are like swaddlers...soft, more cloth like."
2,Beware,Its not what is expected. I really did'nt like Pampers Baby dry.I have been using Pampers Swaddlers dry max since my baby was born. I had no problem with it. It was really soft and feels good. But comparatively Pampers Baby dry is not good. It looks like plastic.By seeing the price i ust got fooled..So Beware before purchasing this product.
4,Good diapers for a decent price,"I found that these baby dry diapers hold up well during the night for my son. They are not as soft as pampers cruiers, but work great. I found amazon to be the best price around, (are they were shipped right to our door!)"
5,awesome! I save a lot of money,It is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one. I saved a lot of money and didn'y worry to run out of diaper anytime soon.
2,big diapers,Now I am sitting on a big box of diapers that don't even fit my daughter anymore. Very disappointing since I thought that this would be a good deal.
1,Don't buy this it should be called 2 hours dry not 12,"This is the worst diaper I ever tried. I used the fisher price brand or luvs, I saw this on sale and was mislead by the 12 hour overnight protection advertisement which turns out to be more like2 hours. Maybe that was a typo LOL. Seriously this is not worth a dime and don't waste your money you will be wiping poop and peep of the floor in no time. They are no match for my 20 months old daughter"
1,Not a good product,Pampers changed their diapers and added a new material (or substance) that I can only guess is suppossed to absorb moisture. It is TERRIBLE!!! It has given my littlt guy the worst diaper rash. The first box of diapers I received was great. The fit was perfect and they were identical to the ones in the hospital. The next box was totally different with that new strip and they are just awful. Do not buy them unless they are without the strip (will be white in color and just have Sesame characters). The ones with the strip are blue with sesame characters.
3,Good day diaper,I really liked these diapers for my first kid but my second kid pees like crazy and she soaked through them during the night so I had to switch to a night diaper but otherwise I liked them and I did really like the price.
2,Constant Rash,"Great price for this product, but it caused both of my kids to have rashes. I ended up going out and buying another kind to mix with them so the rash would subside enough that we could use the diapers without wasting money and having to throw them away. These also don't have elastic in the back waistband of the diaper...another really nice feature in other brands."
1,Every poo is a blow-out,"I began using these diapers for my newborn, but was sorely disappointed to find that the diaper offered little protection for anyone holding my baby when she had a poo. Perhaps she is oddly shaped causing the diaper to fit poorly; however, she seems perfectly normal to me, so I am guessing it is the fault of the diaper. Every poo was a blow-out!"
2,Smells like pee,"If you like smelling pee all day long, buy these diapers. Don't get me wrong, I love pampers. I love Pampers swaddlers. We have been huge fans since day one in the NICU with the micro preemie pampers that were smaller than a credit card and still too big.Yes, these hold in the pee but good lord you smell it. With technology in diapers, spend a few more dollars and go with the swaddlers. If you buy them on amazon with the prime membership you'll get a better deal."
4,Good but Swaddlers are better,"I tried Swaddlers, Huggies Snug N Dry and this one.1. Huggies and Baby Dry are functionally equivalent but not as good as swaddlers. This one is softer than Huggies.2. Not as good and leak proof as Pampers Swaddlers.Verdict: Buy Swaddlers upto size 2 and then switch to this one from size 3."
4,Great Product!,"I really like these diapers. They fit my little lady just right and only leak if they get really really full or if she's laying in a strange position. I do prefer the diapers with the wetness indicator, but they don't have value packs that are this large. Overall, I am very satisfied with these diapers. I like them ten time better than huggies!"
3,Pampers size 4 diapers,"The elastic in the wasteband is great and fits my little one comfortably. However, Pampers in my opinion doesn't hold as much as Huggies. There have been several times that my little one has woken up with wet clothes while wearing Pampers but that is rare when he is wearing Huggies."
2,Pampers,"I was really unhappy using these,they leaked badly many times.In the past I have used the Pampers Cruisers and was very happy with them.I now buy Huggies little movers since I feel those are the best diapers around."
1,Worst diapers- Ever.,"I ordered these before our son was born. At the time, I didn't know the difference between the swaddlers and the baby dry. Well, I learned the hard way as these leak like CRAZY. I cannot convey how truly awful these are. Please spare yourself the pain and don't get these diapers. Baby dry is awful."
1,"weird fit, majorly leaks overnight","These diapers have a weird high-cut fit, and our 2 1/2 year old has peed through them ENORMOUSLY both of the first two nights he wore them. Wet down to his feet. They just don't seem to have enough absorbency for the job."
1,Welts and red rashes,"I have been using these diapers for both of my girls for years. My last Subscribe and Save box landed on my doorstep last week and my 15 month old daughter has had welts and red hot rashes on her diaper area ever since. I hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else and that whatever has changed is fixed quickly. For now I will switch to Seventh Generation.Last week I received my box on my doorstep and due to the new frustration free packaging, couldn't open the box with my hands anymore due to all the tape on top of the box. This makes it a bit of a frustration, instead of less."
4,we don't use any other,"My daughter occasionally collects a little bit of residue from the diaper down there, but for the most part it's clean, doesn't deteriorate, and holds a lot of water."
4,Love 'em,"These diapers are GREAT! They fit perfectly on my baby, they don't leak and my son can move around in them, they are not restricting at all!"
5,Best diapers ever!,"Since our daughter was born, we used only Pampers diapers. They cost a little bit more than the ""generic"" ones, but you get what you pay for. They fit well and no liquid ever ""dripped-out"" of them. Go with Pampers and you cannot be wrong."
1,CHEAP! DO NOT BUY!!,"I bought this product because it was less expensive than the Pampers Cruisers and I thought it might a comparable product. WRONG!! Simply picking up the product, you can tell it isn't made as well and has a more plastic feel to it. I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it a ""0"". By the next day, my son had a diaper rash like none I have ever seen. My husband and I have practically had to hog-tie him to put ointment on his bottom or even bathe him. He even cried when he was sitting. We switched back to Cruisers and he is healing, thankfully, but still has marks two weeks later. We will NEVER buy this product again. Do not walk, RUN from this product."
1,Wet every morning,We used Pampers swadlers and loved them. When we switched to size 4 we decided on Pampers Baby Dry. What a mistake! Every morning we woke up to our son completely wet. These diapers do not hold enough water!
4,pampers,papers would have been great but the wrong size. They were automatically sent and by the time I received them my son out grew them.
1,Feels like duct tape,"The baby dry diapers are terrible! I'm so glad I didn't buy them. I received them as a shower gift. They have a plastic duct tape feel to the top portion and they left my son's skin very moist. He literally had urine sitting on his skin when I opened his diaper. NOT my idea of a good diaper. I stick to Pampers Swaddlers or Pampers Cruisers, depending on which size you are using."
1,These are the worst diapers ever!!!!,I bought these diapers not realizing that they were the baby dry. I usually use the swaddlers and I love them. So when I noticed these ones were different I thought it would be okay. No way!!! I used about 5 diapers and my 2 month old son blew out of every single one...keep in mind we have never had any blow outs before. So I definately would never recommend these diapers to anyone. Now I am stuck with 270 diapers I will never use...ugh
3,Almost worth the money,"The amount for the price had me sold... however, I used Huggies prior to this and will be returning to them. Pampers just don't hold as much as Huggies. Big #2's leak out of the diaper and it just makes a huge mess neither my little one nor me wants to deal with. Also I noticed more redness on the skin along the thighs from the diaper rubbing against the skin. She's wearing the right size, anything larger would be too loose... I just wasn't fully satisified with the product."
2,Not great,"These are ok diapers for daytime use. We have blowouts almost everytime we use them overnight. My son is 22 months old, so it's not like he has runny newborn poop anymore. I don't even let him wear these for naps anymore because they just don't work that well for sleep. They are very ""paper-y"" feeling compared to cruisers, which I could tolerate if they worked better. Once I finsh the rest of these I will not be purchasing them again."
2,Lots ot Leaks,In general I like Pampers items and quality. But the Baby Dry version I seem to have a lot of leaks.
2,Reaction,"I like these diapers, however, my son gets severe diaper rash with the pampers brand so we use Huggies and there is no rash. The best Huggies are the supremes, worth every extra penny."
2,Horrible compared to Cruisers,The quality difference between this and Pampers Cruisers is just amazing. We hate these diapers. I'd actually buy store brand before buying this. You get a few less diapers when you buy Pampers Cruisers but it is well worth it to get them instead!
4,Pampers Diapers,"Pampers diapers are very absorbant and fit my babies well. The only thing that I wish Pampers would change is to take the scent off the diapers. Huggies aren't scented, and I prefer them because of that. My babies have gotten rashes because of the perfume."
3,"fab product, but overpriced","I used to buy pampers from Amazon through the subscribe and save program with free shipping. Amazon switched to Huggies in their subscribe save program and dumped the free shipping. The 252 count of size 1 baby dry is $42.99 at Amazon and $32.99 at Babies-R-Us. Plus Babies-R-Us gives me coupons every month for $10 off when you buy 2 boxes, or $7 off when I buy one box and a box of wipes. I still use Amazon for other things, but not for diapers!!"
2,"To my surprise, it leaked frequently","I used Pampers sensitive diapers since my baby was born. As she grows and sleeps longer through the night, I was thinking maybe this Max Dry diaper will give her even better comfort. Yet, to my surprise, it didn't. Moreover, it leaked multiple times that I had to changed her from inside out. So I returned the rest of the package and continued using my previous Pampers Sensitive ones.By the way, I never receive any partial refund on this return package!"
5,Pampers are best,"Have tried all diapers. My boys leak out of all except these baby dry pampers, didn't try the cruisers since they are more expensive. It should say something since all the hospitals I work t use pampers. Swaddles are best for new babies and baby dry from then on out. Amazon has great prices. Love when you have amazon mom and the extra coupon from parenting magazine"
2,Leaks,I've had to throw at least 6 onesies because of the leakage riding up my sons back:( awful my next attempt is to try pampers swaddles while he still fits into their size. Hopefully they work out since there are many good reviews.
5,super light,"I just got these, they are super thin, but seem to hold alot! I like how light weight they are."
5,Baby Dry is the Best!,I bought a bag of these at the store because they were on sale and used it. It is the best diaper ever! I started using it when my baby was 8 weeks old and she slept for 8 hours! Prior to that we were using the Swaddlers and they were getting soaked after just 4-5 hours. Our baby is almost 11 weeks old now and she's sleeping 11 hours a night and these diapers lasts her that long. These are the best. I have ordered more and will swear by these diapers now!
1,Pampers leak,I don't often write reviews but I feel I need to. I have twin girls and have found that everytime I use Pampers they leak. The sizing is correct based on the label but they do not absorb enough through the night. I have had to change sheets many times. I do not find this happens with other diapers and Pampers are expensive.
5,Pampers Baby Dry Newborn Size,"These work great, I have been using them for my baby boy who was born 7 lbs and is now 10 lbs. The only time we have leaks is when we dont change him at every feeding.The only drawback of these pampers is they dont have the wetness strip. That being said after 2 months of diaper changes I can tell without the strip when he is wet."
1,Lack of quality and capacity,The quality of these diapers just doesn't compare to Huggies. They don't hold up overnight for my 18 month old. I'm just sorry I bought 192 of these diapers!
3,Disappointed with latest purchase,I always preferred Pampers to other brands like Luvs and Huggies. But the latest box of Pampers that I got seemed to absorb less for some reason. I feel a wet layer on the top everytime I change my daughter and she started getting rashes on her skin. This is the first time this happened so Im gonna try the Cruisers next time. I read reviews that it absorbs better so Im gonna give it a try. Hope that works better!! But I truly love Pampers !! If the Cruisers disappoint I may switch to Huggies.
1,Not a good diaper for us,"Decided to try these as a cheaper alternative to Earths Best diapers. Since I read they don't have Drymax, I thought it would be okay to use. Within the first day of use, my child started getting a reddish rash. It went away as soon as we stopped using these. My feeling is that it is due to the blue colored absorbent material and/or the scent. I did not realize the diapers had a scent, since I was used to the EB diapers."
2,Not the best diaper for boys.,"I have two girls and a boy, when my daughters were in diapers I always used huggies, but when my son was born they did not keep him dry through the night so I switched to Pampers Baby Dry because that was the type of diaper that claimed to be best for boys, but it is not, my son leaks through all over his clothes and the person holding him and the diaper itself is nearly dry. It is as though the diaper can not absorb the pee fast enough. I would not recomend this product."
5,diapers,"I bought the pampers brand due to the deal you get thru amazon, and Im happy with them. This is my first baby, so I really do not know much about diapers, they keep everything in most of the time. I swear she shoots stuff sideways sometimes so it leaks thru her legs but I dont think thats the diapers fault! lol A diaper is a diaper I think!"
1,Do not buy this!!!,We bought this baby dry I think this is great mistake done by me. Its getting wet so soon. Before we were using cruisers but we thought why don't we try this once. Never ever buy this pampers baby dry.
1,WORST Diapers I have ever used!!! Do not waste your money,"They leak, they do NOT hold my daughter over through the night, they do not hold in the poop, they are thin and useless, and are loose around the leg after only an hour of wear. I opted for these instead of Huggies because I got a great deal on them... I'll never make that mistake again!"
2,not the best.,i used ordered these because i thought they might have the netting in it and i heard those were good but they arnt they have like sand or something. they are just too bulky and i got size 2 because pampers cruisers size 3 were pretty big but these were too small. sxo i had to change her ALOT multiple times during the night so i gues i shoulda got a smaller pack to try out then to just go crazy and order the HUGE BULK lol but thats my fault. i like the pampers cruisers VERY SOFT. and nice.
5,Jessica B.,very good product! good price for the amount too when compared to the stores. this products ships in a short amount of time too.
2,Gave a rash,The baby dry diapers left a rash on my baby. Not a diaper rash another kind of rash. I will never use these again.
5,Great Diapers,The baby dry diapers are great. My daughter has been using them since she was 3 months old (now 15 months) and has never had any rashs or leaks in them. I will not be ordering these from Amazon anymore. They have changed the discount on the MOM program so that it's not worth it anymore.
1,Love Pampers hate these diapers,"I love Pampers products and bought these with complete confidience but I was extremely disappointed.These diapers are awful, they do not hold anything and they caused my daughter to have a rash. I only wish I had bought Cruisers."
2,To small,I was using swaddlers (pampers yellow box) and then decided to try these baby-dry (pampers green box. My 5 month old is in a size 2 but when I ordered size 2 in the baby-dry they were to small even though she was still in the weight range (15lbs) they give on the box. So my advise is that the baby-dry pampers run small.
3,Not as good as Cruisers,"These diapers leaked every night we put them on my son (he usually has a very wet diaper in the morning). We always buy Cruisers, which we rarely have problems with, and this is the first time for Baby-Dry. We use the Baby-Dry during the day (to finish the pack) and put him in a Cruiser for the night. I probably won't buy Baby-Dry again and will just spend a little more for the Cruisers."
4,"delivered diapers..come on, a win/win","This is the biggest box of diapers that I can find in my area and it's tough for me to get to the store so having these delivered to my door is amazing. They do ship directly in the box, as is, in the picture. So if you live in a condo/apt/etc. and need privacy with your packages or are concerned that someone might take them, maybe not a good idea?"
5,Pampers purchase on Amazon,"I have used pampers for my son ever since he has been born. Great product and I love the rewards program they have as well.I always buy my Pampers through Amazon, I have yet to find them cheaper (even at Sam's Club). I also love the easy of having them sent right to my door."
1,Very disappointed,"My kids both wore Pampers. The last few times I've bought Pampers for my youngest they fall apart so easily. He doesn't even wear them that long before he has stringy diaper hanging off. I tried to chalk the first box off as maybe its a defective box or that he is so active. But after 3 boxes I know longer believe it. It doesn't leak, but just seems to fall apart (hard to describe) no matter if he's worn them for 5 min or longer. I can't wait until he is fully potty trained so he won't need them anymore. I am very disappointed"
3,Not that good anymore,"We've been using these diapers a little over a year. I would say Pampers used to be the best diapers on the market but not now. The quality is dropping. They do not hold overnight and now, they very offten just tear apart. Very dissapointed as the price is going up when the quality is going down. Something is not right."
2,Not for babies with sensitive skin!,"Pampers are actually an okay brand of diaper, however I put one on my daughter with sensitive skin (and eczema) and she immediately broke out in a rash in every area the diaper touched! I could not use the rest of the package and the rash took several days to go away. If your baby has sensitive skin at all, stay away from Pampers. Huggies work best."
5,Pampers Are the Best,Hands down pampers are the best diapers. Never had a problem with leaking or skin breakdown on my baby.
1,Buy Swaddlers or Cruisers Instead,"I tried these diapers b/c my daughter's diaper was leaking at night, and these were the worst of all of the diapers I tried. They even leaked during the day.If you have nighttime diaper leaks, try going up a size and buying Pampers Swaddlers or Cruisers instead!Pampers Swaddlers, Size 2-3 (14-22 Lbs), Economy Plus Pack, 152 SwaddlersPampers Cruisers, Size 4 (22-37 Lbs), Economy Plus Pack, 140 Cruisers"
1,Awful...,"We tried a bunch of different diapers for our 2 month old. Huggies Natural, Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry, other Huggies and by far the most leaky diapers were Baby Dry. #1 and #2 never stayed in the diaper! Right out the sides and back and all over me...almost every time. Also, the absorbent core stuff would come out and stick to our baby's skin. Swaddlers are absolutely fabulous and we'll stick with those."
3,Not as good as the Swaddlers,"Not bad, but for our little girl, the Swaddlers did a better job of containing her ""blowouts""."
3,"Get the job done, however...","I switched from Pampers Cruisers to Pampers Baby Dry because the Baby Dry economy pack offers about a week's worth more diapers for about the same price. So far for every 5 diapers I use, I have to throw one out because the tabs just rip off as I secure the diaper around my little one - and that was rarely the case with Cruisers, unless we picked up a faulty box. Also, the fit around the leg and bottom is very loose, so these are NOT the best diapers to use for overnight."
2,Not absorbant enough,I liked these the best when my baby was 16 lbs. but now at 20lbs he leaks through every one of them in 2 hours or less. The 4's fit a little too big and I know he's almost ready but these are supposed to be good to 28lbs and they are not. I have almost an entire case of these that I am donating because I don't trust them. Size 3 of Sam's Club brand is working WAY better than these and cost less too.
3,Great for babies who don't crawl.,"I loved these diapers for my girls because they did such a good job keeping them dry through the night. However, once they started crawling, moving, cruising, etc. these diapers didn't quite hold up as well. I used to love how soft and cushy they were, but that turned into saggy baggy diapers hanging to their knees when they started pulling up and crawling. I would recommend switching to Pamper's Cruisers if your child is mobile and in a size 4 diaper or larger."
5,pampers are the best,"these are much better then huggies , first off huggies run smaller, they dont hold as much for as long eaither, the design seems nice but the over all quality is good just isnt as good in my option for the price dif. ,"
1,These leak bad!!,"I have been loyal to Pampers diapers since my 13 month old was in Newborn Swaddlers. I tried these diapers because of the positive ratings and I am VERY disappointed. The diapers are rectangular and not good for a cruising baby. The front of the tabs turn under so they sometimes leak out the side. Also, they say they are suppose to last 12 hours. My daughter usually sleeps 10 hours straight at night and by morning the diaper has ""sweated"" pee through the diaper and through her pajamas and I've even had to change her sheets. I go through a lot more diapers with these because i have to change her very frequently. For some reason the Pampers Cruisers with dry max gave my daughter diaper rash so I guess I'm buying Huggies next time."
4,We love baby dry!,"We are strictly a Pampers family. We used swaddlers until my son grew out of size 2-3s then we went directly to cruisers. We had a few leakage issues with cruisers, when my son would roll to his belly in the middle of the night, but were happy with them in general. A few friends of ours had been using baby dry's and metioned that they loved them (and that they were a little cheaper than cruisers!) so we decided to give them a try. And we LOVE them. We have not had one overnight leak! The only complaint that I have is that the tabs are made a little cheaper than swaddlers & cruisers, and a few of them have ripped right off as I'm fastening the diaper. I've just learned to be a little gentler with them, and we haven't had a problem since. Overall, I give them an A!"
5,Best diapers we've used!,"We've tried Costco's diapers and to a limited extent, Huggies... From our experience, Baby Dry are the best at catching leaks and offer the most value."
3,Not bad and definitely not good...,When my daughter came home from the hospital she was in regular Pampers swaddlers and we never had a leak or an issue. We figured we would give these a try since they were Pampers brand as well. Well DD is 3 months old and about 13 lbs and we have had so many leaks. We change her at night every 3-4 hours and have had to change her clothes as well because of the diaper being soaked. Of course that is no fun. They are box shaped so they do not curve around the thighs or fit as snuggly as the Swaddlers or the Huggies Little Snugglers. We wont be buying these again.
2,Ok ...,Not Worked on my baby.... he drinks plenty of water.. so obviously tooks more diapers at night times...i was keep on changings 2 or 3 times every night ...it didnt set for babies who takes plenty of water
1,Leak with breastfeed poop up the back!,These diapers leek up the back when my baby poops! Then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on! Annoying!!
1,Terrible rash! Going back to Hughies,"We switch to pampers for the savings but my son developed a terrible rash. After a week (treating him in the meantime with lotions, skin barriers and other topical creams), we got back to Hughies and his rask got clearly better in a couple of days. We used pampers swadllers before wihtout any problems. I found in the internet other people with similar issues:[...]If your kid has allergies or delicate skin, I will say to do not use this diapers."
1,Terrible diapers! I will never buy again,I purchased these diapers thinking that Pampers is a good brand. These were terrible! A tiny amount of pee would fill these and make them very tight. I will never buy again!
1,Horrible - how does anyone use these???,"I assumed since these are a well-known brand, that they would work well. They are the worst diapers I have ever used - pee leaks stright through them, ie if you don't change the baby pretty often, their clothes will be soaked more than once a day. How am I going to use up these 200+ diapers? Ugh."
1,Used to be our favorite until recently when the quality dropped.,"We had been using Pampers Baby Dry for our daughter right after she outgrew newborn size of Pampers Swaddlers. Now my daughter is almost 20 months old at size 4. We couldn't be happier with Pamper Baby Dry until the last shipment we received from Amazon. The diapers are thinner than before and leak frequently. I thought it may be a bad batch and bought a smaller size of the same product from a department store. They were exactly the same and also caused leaks. The leaks happen both at morning and night times. I'm too disappointed in the product to give it a 3rd try. We are switching to Huggies Snug & Dry. Hopefully, they will work better."
3,"Baby might be dry, but his clothes aren't","These diapers don't work as well as the Swaddlers I was using previously. Every morning my baby wakes up with wet clothes. I thought maybe it was because he was getting older, or somehow producing more urine, but I had a few of the swaddlers left over so I tried those for a couple of nights. He woke up with perfectly dry clothes.Dissapointed, now I have a whole box of these to use up!"
3,White material leaks out from diapers and cause messes,"This is the 3rd different package of Pampers diapers (size 5 twice and now size 6) the diapers opens and causes a mess of white fluffy material spread on my baby's body and of the floor. Difficult to clean, but no rash (I have seen some other reviewers mentioning rash on their babies).This did not happen previously when I used Pampers to my other 2 boys (9-11 years ago), so I think it has to do the factory and the diapers now are not sealed right."
1,Worst diaper we ever tried,"This is the worst diaper we ever tried. After my 20 months old daughter go to bad (changing diaper at 9pm) we have to change it at around 4am, otherwise she (her outfit, bad and comforter) will be totally wet by the morning. We had no other diaper with such an experience. During daytime it is even worse, sometimes it start letting thru everything after few hours. We use 5-7 diapers a day whereas we needed only 3-4 from cruisers. This simply have not enough absorbent to stay dry for 12 hours (as advertised)"
3,Better than everyday diapers,"I bought these for my daughter when she was 6 months old so I could skip the night diaper change. Its pretty soggy in the morning, and if I wake up enough through the night, I will change her."
1,AWFUL!!!,THESE DIAPERS ARE HORRIBLE. I ALWAYS BUY THE PAMPERS CRUISERS BUT SINCE THE STORE WAS OUT OF STOCK I THOUGHT PAMPERS MAKES THESE AS WELL SO THEY MUST BE GOOD AS WELL. WELL I WAS WRONG MY DAUGHTER WEARS THEM FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HER PEE PASSES THROUGH THE DIAPER. THEY SHOULD MAKE IT TO AN HOUR AT LEAST. ONE PEE AND I HAVE TO CHANGE HER DIAPER. HORRIBLE I CAN'T BELIEVE PAMPERS MAKES THESE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE DIAPERS!!!
5,It does the job!,"The main thing with diapers is that you want to get a great deal, and this was one of the best ones we saw. Very pleased."
3,Worth the money,One of the things I like about Pampers is that it holds for a long time on my baby. The downside is that it weighs my toddler down as she pees more on the diaper. Overall it is a good product to buy. At least it is better than some of the others out there.
4,great diaper for the price,I have been using these diapers on my 6 week old son for a couple of weeks now an havent had any issues with them like some people say they have. They are thinner then the swaddler dry max but I think these do there job great. I have not had any leaks with these at all. But my son is a sleepy baby and just got out of the NICU so I change his diaper every 3 hours to help wake him up. I do prefer the swaddlers dry max as I think they are a nicer and thicker diaper but if your looking for value for money these are fine.
1,My husband even complains about these!!,"These diapers are junk! I recently tried some Pampers again and they were terrible! The tabs would rip off half the time and this would really make my husband disgruntled! I told him Pampers are supposed to be the ""best"" in the diaper area! He told me to stick with the Huggies! Boys and girls, quality, price, Huggies are the way to go in our household! I would not recommend these diapers for anyone, unless you like throwing unused daipers into the garbage can!"
1,HATED these pampers! Don't buy,"I purchased these Pampers from Amazon for my 7 month old. These pampers have the ability to burst open in the night while your baby is sleeping. When my daughter woke up the next morning, the pamper burst open on her belly. The padding inside the pamper was released on her belly on several other occasions. I didn't have this problem with Huggies. I will NOT purchase Pampers ever again. This is a hazard and they should be recalled."
2,Pamper lover sadly disappointed by this version,"I have been using pampers swaddlers with dry max since my twins were born and love them! I can count on 1 hand the number of ""blow outs"" and leaks. I use subscribe and save and my item was unavailable for the previous purchase price. I decided to try these. I thought they also had dry max since they said baby dry. I am now having at least one leaky diaper every morning and have had 3 diapers I had to throw away because the tabs tore. This has never happened. My twins are one and in size 3 diapers. I have tried the cruisers which seem to be ok. I'm not sure if it is just the lot I have or this line of diapers. I may have to go back to the cruisers since the swaddlers are not made in large sizes."
2,no two day delivery almost made for a diaper emergency,"I was expecting the usual prime 2 day delivery when I ordered this package of diapers over a week ago. I guess I have become so spoiled by Amazon's 2 day delivery that I just expected it to be here, and have been anxiously awaiting its arrival everyday until I had to breakdown and go to Target for diapers yesterday to avoid a complete crises....I will read the fine print next time or make sure I am getting the fast delivery schedule that I am expecting"
5,A Pampers Household,We love Pampers. They are all we use in our house. I can trust that they will make it through long nights and keep my baby from getting diaper rashes. Love them!
2,Not what the name implies!,"My daughter was wearing the Huggies prior to this. I ordered this diapers, thinking that they would be softer and more absorbent than the Huggies. To my surprise, they are neither softer or more absorbent. I'm very disappointed and have had to change many skirts, and pants because of this!I am planning on writing to Kimberly Clark as well regarding this. Also, these diapers run small!"
2,Not good for night times,"Target diapers are much better than these diapers. My daughter sleeps through the night. When she wakes up her dress, the sheet everything will be wet. This diaper is ok to use during the day times but definitely not at night."
3,Ancient Egypt,I read just about anything I can on ancient Egypt from factual data to historical novels. I had a hard time getting into this particular novel. It was a bit slow moving but got better as i progressed into it.
1,I don't do novels and this is why. . .,"This author knew very little about ancient Egypt, it's people and it's history - and didn't bother to learn.A wast of time."
2,Difficult,I wish this was broken into sections like the copy I borrowed from the library. It's kind of overwhelming the way it is printed without any breaks.
2,Beyond me,"I know this is a classic, popular book, and Walt Whitman is amazing, but it just seemed like rambling random thoughts to me. I'm sure there are a few lines in there that will really speak to me, but I couldn't finish it. Maybe it's just too intellectual for me."
2,Not the 1855,"At least as available for the Kindle, this is not the 1855 edition. It seems to be the final edition, which is of course great, but not what I intended to get based on the product description posted. Also, the foreward and afterward mentioned in the description are missing. I don't expect the moon for a low price, but I do expect to get what I pay for."
2,Not a Dan Brown,I bought this book based on buyer's reviews. I was very disappointed. This book is filled with much violence and little mystery/content.
2,not the same book,this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website. very old version and took forever to get here.
1,A looser,I bought this and returned it. There must be someone out there with the right voice and reading skills to bring us Whitman's words and rhythms. Ms. Gibson's soprano sing-song doesn't make it.
1,Whitman Glorified?,"Whitman Glorified?Whitman's descriptions of nature are inspired and his style exudes with the same passion as his subject. Yet, his self-absorption overshadows his talent. Whitman's poem, ""Song of Myself"" takes up a significant portion of the book, Leaves of Grass. Here, Whitman keeps no points in reserve, but spends 52 sections ""celebrating"" himself. He feels he, as man, is the great panacea. He suckles at its mercy until it fills not only his subject matter, but influences his technique and his structure as well. His intriguing mind leads the reader along, until disappointment is found in another laborious passage expounding god status and the call to ascend to his level of distorted thinking. Whitman's momentary descriptive nuggets are lost in a sea of narcissism."
3,the American's American,"Several reviewers state that Whitman is a ""real American."" Fair enough. But when his ""bravado and self-love"" are defended in the name of some sort of humility then someone is projecting their own romantic reading onto a person who was a self-proclaimed imperialist. He was hardly someone who wanted everyone to find their own truth. Of course, in today's post-9/11 America, being an imperialist certainly makes Whitman seem like a contemporary American."
2,Bold Faced Thoughts: Confusing,The bold faced comments by Laura Ross are frustrating. Who cares what she thinks? It would have been much more appropriate and an easier read without them. The thoughts are not sensitive to the original - seems lick a gemick.Not happy with the book.
2,Kindle edition - weak production values,"I recently got a Kindle, so I started looking for books to put in to it. Walt Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" is an old favorite of mine, so I looked for Kindle editions. There were 31 matches to my search, though not all of them are the actual book of poems. My complaints about this offering start with the absence of a table of contents. Whitman didn't title the poems in the original 1855 edition, though he did in subsequent editions, but a table of contents could show the first line of each poem. Beyond the lack of TOC, the edition is not identified nor is the ""publisher,"" which makes it difficult, though not impossible, to associate a rating with a specific offering."
5,Well worth $1,"I needed a copy of ""Leaves of Grass"" that includes the 1855 prose preface. The formatting of this Kindle book is perfect. I know I could read it on my computer for free on some websites, but I wanted a version for my Kindle. This Kindle edition will not disappoint you! I gladly paid $1 for a more ""portable"" option. I prefer reading on Kindle than the computer screen."
5,nice,This is a good app that works well with the system and we have had no problems with this app so far.
5,Love it,"Love it....Love it! I have been trying to find the book, but I guess an electronic copy works better since I will forever own it on my kindle!"
5,"Review of Walt Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass""","This thick soft-backed ""pocket"" book has 490 pages. It could be called The Complete Whitman. It contains hundreds of poems.I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers. He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist. He truly believed in equality and democracy. He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment.Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish. Whitman was a man ahead of his time."
2,hyped!,"Walt Whitman's literary reputation has been hyped by ""gay"" critics (I suspect). I'm not totally hostile to free verse; in fact, I like T.S. Eliot, the most famous proponent of this genre, but Whitman wrote ramblingly, seemingly devoid of poetic coherence that the reader's creative imagination is left unstirred. I agree with Robert Frost, the truly great American poet, that writing poetry without the classic, conventional rules is like playing tennis--with no net."
4,Leaves of Grass was a mandatory read in Junior High...,I did not like it then as it was a push to read it. I do enjoy it now as there is no grade associated with it!Be in a place where you can put yourself in a different time and place; project what he is writing about in you mind to a simpler time.
1,Do not buy this edition,"I compared this to many other editions and this edition is completely wrong, the structure of the poems is all messed up.It's such a pity considering Whitman's poetry that the people of Simon and Brown were not even able to print an edition that manages to respect something as simple as the spacing and lines of the poems.Here is an example of the Simon and Brown edition, exactly as it was printed by them:As I ponder'd in silence, Returning upon my poems, considering,lingering long, A Phantom arouse before me with distrustful aspect,Terrible in beauty, age, and powerIt is painfully obvious that it should be, as I have seen in all other editions I consulted:As I ponder'd in silence,Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,Terrible in beauty, age, and power,The whole book was edited in this way, which makes it unreadable"
4,A reprieve,A nice book to read when you want to relax and reflect on life. I enjoy the poems but will take awhile to go through the book.
2,A great disappointment,"In the full bloom of my late sixties, I find too much of Whitman's writing far less rhapsodic or even elegiac than I both remember and am told it to be. Hot air, any one?"
1,The uninitiated...,"I wasn't exposed to Whitman in my education so I gave this try. I ploddingly and tediously read the introduction and the first 40 pages of this book before I threw it down.I failed and I am sorry. Certainly I am a philistine who deserves to be excoriated by the community who loves his work. Here's my attempt to make peace:If you're wondering if Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" is a good place to start your enjoyment of poetry, go ahead and give it a whirl! You can get it used for a penny."
3,As Kiss As Does,"I hate literary types who venerate books and authors like some Virgin Mary and cannot see the problems-inherent. This book is REALLY BORING. Yes, he does have an amazing style of poetry that revolutionized literature, but it's still BORING. His poems, like Song of Myself drag on for like 100 pages rumbling over all sorts of thoughts, events, seemingly haphazardly chunked together without any real logical thread, and just DRAGS & DRAGS. I dare anyone to read this book cover to cover more than once."
1,Rip Off,"This edition DOES NOT contain a table of contents, which makes it impossible to navigate and totally useless overall.Save your dollar and look elsewhere."
3,More Walt Whitman,"Keep these freebies coming, Amazon, and you will turn me into a Walt Whitman expert! Never cared for him when I was younger. Now that I am in my golden years, I love reading him. Better late than never."
3,"Not Quite the ""Original"" Edition","While I love Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass,"" I wouldn't quite consider this a reproduction of the ""original"" edition. The editor has highlighted certain passages in green, and added commentary and exercises at the end of each poem. I suspect lots of folks won't mind this. For me it's cause enough to return the book.I pre-ordered this item because I was intent on finding an edition with the 1855 preface, but without some new person's additions to the classic work. I very much would like to read the work as Whitman presented it, without interjections from an editor or some other new person whose voice for me is an interruption.This editor presents this work as a means for writers to find inspiration for their own work, and attempts to guide or at least aid the reader in that project. For someone like me, for whom writing (and reading) is intensely personal, and who prefers to work directly with the text, without intervention, this is just not the right book."
1,A Mistake,"A co-worker gave this book to me. He was more of a fan than I, but Whitman grew on me, and over the next several months, I learned to appreciate his work.However, I left this book above my toilet and was disturbed that a relative of mine snooped through it while taking a dump, discovering secrets that this co-worker and I had together. I now regret ever having read this silly book and am planning on burning it."
1,Line break hell,It is frustrating that the Kindle cannot accommodate this. It was not fun to read with awkward line breaks.
1,This book does not contain the 1855 edition!,"While I adore the first edition of Leaves of Grass, this book is not as advertised. I definitely encourage you to buy it in another edition. I returned mine with a note, so hopefully Amazon will change the description soon."
4,"Not a perfect edition, but the first edition text is well worth having","So far I have come across a few typos in this edition. The typesetting is not ideal. The introduction is fine, but line-breaks are placed somewhat arbitrarily in the text of the poem, so that it is necessary to play with the font size and/or words per line to get satisfactory formatting. It is also a shame that the engraving of Whitman included in the first edition of the book is not reproduced. Other than that, it is good to have the original edition of this book for a small price"
3,Good... for the price,"Note: this review is not about Whitman's work (always worthy of five stars) but is instead an evaluation of this particular Kindle edition of Leaves of Grass.This is a great value, but it's not perfect. It includes a bearable representation of the text, but the table of contents is hard to navigate - it's tough to get the Kindle's cursor to even line up with the links - and at the default text size the lines of the poems don't wrap well. However, at 99 cents, I have no real complaints about this Kindle book, especially as a supplement since I already own the real text version on paper."
2,"Difficult to find events, and some events ignored","It is difficult to find specific events in this DVD -- partly because the Main Menu is organized by Olympics Day 1, Day 2, and so on; and partly because some events simply aren't there. Kim Yu-Na, for instance, is on the screen for only a few seconds. So don't look here for her world record-setting performances (or any other figure skating performances, come to think of it). If you know what day the event you are looking for took place, that would help. But there's still no guarantee that it would be included.It seems that this DVD is meant for casual viewing. If you would like some sports rumbling on your TV, and you aren't particular about what, then this might be for you. It does include highlights of the opening and closing ceremonies, and of performances by Lindsay Vaugn, Shaun White, and Apollo Ohno. But they are just highlights, and you have to take them as you find them -- that is, IF you find them."
1,Shameful,"In my opinion, this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage. My five year old was in TEARS because we could only find five second clips of actual skating. To make matters worse, there doesn't seem to be anyway to access the actual skating events, even if one is willing to pay for it. Nor does the Olympic website itself have videos of the events. I could understand if we were searching the week of the Olympics, or even that month. However, it's been close to a year. SHAME ON YOU NBC. The Olympics are not yours."
4,Happy Customer,"Overall the highlights edited together to give a sum-up of the Olympics was excellent. It only lacked giving a bit more highlight time to the figure skating. It seemed to be almost omitted. At least the winning performances would have been nice to see.Everything else was great and certainly captured the feel of the Olympics, including the hockey, skiing, snowboarding, etc., as well as the beauty of Vancouver which is a wonderful city."
2,Decent,"Typical NBC fashion presentation, covering only a small portion of the games, and predominantly their own athletes. Baffled at the lack of hockey coverage seeing as it was clearly the marquee event of the games. Do not purchase expecting hockey, if one were looking for hockey from the games CTV has a full boxed set of the team canada games. Did have nice coverage however of the opening ceremony which was nice."
2,"When it says ""Highlights"", It really does mean just small snippets","I had read several other reviews for this dvd and was left unsure about it's content. Since it was cheap enough, I bought it anyway and I'll hold onto it. But I'm still mad I am unable to find a simple copy of the ENTIRE Opening Ceremony. So when it says ""Highlights"", It really does mean just snippets of clips. Some of the bands didn't even get to finish their songs. The OVER focusing on the US team was annoying too."
3,kd.lang?,"I was wondering: could someone who has seen this tell me; does this dvd contain k.d. lang singing ""Hallelujah""? If not, does anyone know of a video I could buy that does contain that? Thank you!!"
3,Probably OK for pure sports fans,"They cut out the singing of ""O Canada"" by Nikki Yanofsky, which happens to be the best singing at the olympics (yet they put in the lame singing of ""O Canada"" at the end."
3,Pages were torn out from the book,"I knew that the book was used, but the seller did not say that there were pages torn out, especially important pages for the lab units. That would have been useful to know about before buying. Besides that, the book was in good condition."
5,"A ""MUST READ"" (or re-read)","This beautifully told story belongs in every library, and then....lend it out as often as possible! It's a ""classic"" of the ""Holden Caulfield genre, and although I don't know, I'd imagine it's now, or has been, studied in High School English/writing programs."
3,books,"Had trouble with the book, just couldn't keep me interested. But that doesn't mean the same will happened to you. I love to read what New Mexico story tellers have to say, that's how I came to buy this book."
4,Among The Greatest Kung Fu Movies,"I'm now a grandfather. But I've been watching kung fu movies ever since 1961, as a kid growing up in San Francisco Chinatown. This movie rates as one of my all time favorite kung fu movies, and I own about 100 or so.The print isn't very good. The subtitles are hard to read. The story is among the most complicated and convoluted, especially for the non Cantonese speaking. But who watches a kung fu movie for plots?What I really enjoyed about the movie is that it actually shows what the Chinese cinema could actually do. It has tremendous battle scenes. Despite the poor print quality, the movie has some fantastic visuals.The movie is not a documentary. The movie is not an ""imagined documentary."" A lot of things seem to come out of left field. But it's OK. It's a MOVIE!!Quite frankly, the movie plot could easily be translated into a Star Wars episode!"
2,"Amazing Film, but...","This film is amazing. However, don't buy it if you want an english dub. Despite the claim in the product description, there is no dub on this copy."
3,Lord of the Wu-Tang movie dvd,Movie is great classic kung fu but product was scratched and does not play all the way through.
4,Awesome Fantasy!!,"This is different type of Jet Li movie than his others. I haven't seen this type of fantasy movie and i thought it was great!! I was wondering if anyone knew of other movies in the same genre? The only dissappointment was the subtitles, they were unreadable at times. But if you are able to read them there are some very funny conversations...."
3,"Fun, but not great","I bought this dvd under the title ""Kung-Fu Master"" and enjoy it. There's humor, magic, wire-work and pretty ladies so, what's not to enjoy. What seems to bug me the most about it is that the ending is obviously leading up to a sequel and I can't find out what that is. If you're looking for a fun flik, this is good enough. If you're looking for some serious story with excellant martial arts action, you'll be wasting your money buying this."
1,Very poor,"I'm a HUGE Jet Li fan. I love great kung fu movies. This is not one. There is NO kung fu at all. The rest is a surreal dream that includes a guy chained to a boulder and a guy that gets stabbed and asks why he was assassinated. It may be worth a laugh, but that's a stretch."
2,Did I watch the same movie???,"Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused. Was it the same movie? The martial arts were ""ok"" in this, but nothing I havent seen done better before. The story-line was.. ummm. well, nevermind.Oh and did I mention the film doesnt end???? I mean I didnt really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though.I really wantedto like this movie... but the only good thing I can say is that some of the sub-titles are hilarious!"
3,Another Jet Li flying on wires film,"I didn't care for this movie the first time I watched it. It is pretty far from believable. But the 2nd time I watched it and I knew what to expect I enjoyed it a lot more. No, humans don't shoot lightning colored chi out of their hands. And people can't live being strapped to a large boulder. But it is still a good kung fu flick.This one is SUB-TITLED and sometimes hard to read. White letters on a white background. I would like to find another version of this movie that has been dubbed in English for my collection."
4,Fantasy/Martial Arts Extravaganza,"This movie was made to be a fantasy/martial arts movie, and it delivers as promised. I have a very extensive collection of Martial Arts movies and I can honestly say that this movie is one of my top 15 favorite movies. I gave it a 4 instead of a five because it does go a little overboard with the fantasy element, but not enough to distract you from the fighting, and believe me, there's a lot of it."
3,Leave your brain at the door and have some fun,"""The Kung Fu Cult Master"" is an unbelievable fantasy with a whole lot of fights. You'll have to watch the movie about three times before you can understand the story entirely, but you'll love each and every viewing. You gotta love it when there's characters called King of White Lion and Green Bat running around. Lots of fun for all. ...."
4,Fine Fantasy 'Fu,"This film is a real giggle. When I watch it, I feel as though I am witnessing some extravagent daydream by an imaginative pre-teen. The effects are really over-the-top, & the things I found most humorous about it were probably not intended as such. Nevertheless, I have watched it several times and I find it very appealing on some level. Jet Li is really sort of wasted in this flick, because so much of it is ""magic"" & ""super secret final techniques"" that his real martial arts ability is not truly showcased. One feels that anyone else could have played the part... kind of like finding the special gismo that turns ordinary kids into Power Rangers. Still, it is worth having this film in your collection, especially if your funny bone is tickled by the weird and offbeat."
4,If you liked the Matrix...,"I stumbled over this movie on a movie channel in a hotel in Bali, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, and I watched the whole thing.Crazy kung-fu story, over the top acting and more Matrix-like action sequences than you can shake a big stick at. The plot may be hard to follow, but if you want plot, watch Meryl Streep. This movie is about kicking ass, and believe me, everyones ass gets kicked. Different fighting styles satisfy the amateur kung-fu-ist, and the over the top wire movements make this seem more like a live action manga.If only the ladies in this film had agreed to nudity, it would get five stars. Oh, well....Seriously, one of the best in the genre."
4,The Holy Grail,"This DVD is aimed at die-hard Evangelion fans. It also coincides with preproduction of the live-action movie. Evangelion is the Holy Grail of anime TV series.One of the cool things about this DVD is it includes the original episodes and the new versions. Of course, fans will already have the originals, but it's a neat feature.No, there are no previews of the live-action movie, just a Q&A with two production guys from ""The Lord of the Rings."" They're ""really honored to work on this project."" You get the idea.Check out: www.shoyustuff.com for more."
5,This movie grew on me.,"After first watching this movie years ago I thought just another John Wayne ""B"" movie. The more I watched it, the more I realize it was a very good story and very well acted."
4,Good Contemplative Work,"Boehme's `Way to Christ' is a contemplative work that can be read as a meditation. He originated the Myth of the Ungrund, but Boehme placed the entire myth under God's control. His work on the Ungrund led to Berdyaev's existential view of God and was foundational for the meonic nothingness found in Berdyaev. `The Way to Christ' might be hard for modern readers to connect with, but if readers take the time to soak in the word, it can add to a person's spiritual journey. The language will not always be obvious or understandable, but Boehm wrote in a context that was very different from 21st century Westerners."
3,not really for counseling,"I am a counselor in private practiced, and purchased this book as a resource to help some of my young clients. It does include some good materials, but honestly is geared much more toward a classroom or school group setting. A few of the parents of my clients are teachers - they love it!"
3,The first 4 pages were helpful...,"I bought this book to help with my four year old and the introduction was great, however the book is really more useful for older kids. In my opinion this book is much more useful for kids 6 and up and for for educators in particular. I will save it for later. It just doesn't give me enough tools to use right now which is why I bought it."
3,A real help when working with children,"I am a developmental and behavioral pediatrician, who has worked with children for many years on issues of emotional control. I have training in hypnosis to help children learn to envision their emotions, the behaviors of their emotions, and how to become the boss of their emotions. I have found this book to be an excellent adjunct to helping them with the idea of visualization of how anger and axiety affect them.I really feel that people working with children exhibiting anger, should review this book to understand how anxiety might look depending on the child. Research has shown that many angry children (and adults) reach that behavior from anxiety that keeps building up until they need to address it some way."
2,A Bland and Silent Story,"If this was your first Travis McGee book, don't worry. Most of them are much, much better. This book suffers from an overload of the author's rambling commentary on society. After the introduction to jealous husband, you have to slug through 100 pages before you begin to get into typical Travis McGee action. The action is often illogical, and too often Travis - err - Gavin stumbles into old friends at the most unlikely places, bailing him out of trouble. Sorry, this one just didn't click for me. In many ways, it reminded me of the Pale Gray for Guilt story, but there was much less action in this book."
2,"Middle of the pack, lesser Travis, but good enuf","So the consensus is thumbs down.But, even though this isn't MacDonald's best, and even though there are indeed strong--I would say uncharacteristic--elements of misogynism in some of what Travis does to a particular woman for detective purposes, and even though the antagonist is so psychotically evil as to be unlikely to have survived past his teen years (much less prospered as a super-rich international corporate executive), and even though some of the McGee cultural observations seem pedestrian and heavy handed, it's still John D. MacDonald and Travis McGee.As one of the reviewers remarks, it may not be one of MacDonald's best--perhaps his teenage kids were acting up or protesting the war in Vietnam and his wife was verbally abusing him in that timeframe (1971)--but it is certainly memorable....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2009"
3,"Read this one last, or near the end","I do not wish to write a review that says too much, spoiling it for a future reader. I just wanted to say that this one was a disappointment for me. This one was predictable, had Travis doing things that unpleasantly surprised me, and the ending was something cheap and quick. I never felt like I was ""there"" with him as I have in other books.As far as being a tired effort from the end of MacDonald's career, ""The Lonely Silver Rain"" was written in 1985 and was much better in my mind. I would just save ""A Tan and Sandy Silence"" for later or last. Go through the ones that are just gold first."
3,Hurley-burly!,"A decent flick featuring a good performance by Jurgen Prochnow. before he became famous for Das Boot. Coincidentally, the German version of this film is called Der Skipper! Liz Hurley and Patsy Kensit aren't terrific actresses, but they certainly are easy on the eyes."
5,Absolutely breathtaking!,"Several vignettes of various lives taken from a seemingly magical summer eve in a masterfully described Finland countryside. This ain't no ordinary prose! While reading this book, I experienced emotions usually felt while listening to my favorite music, looking at a desert sunset or drinking a fine nut-brown ale. The words jump off the page, straight into your mind and create the most vivid, colourful images imaginable. Track down a copy of this book, it's definately a masterpiece!"
2,"NICE, BUT TRUST ME DONT BUY","Well, i bought this monitor about 2 months ago.. at the time i also needed a tv..so i thought this was a great buy..took it home set it up and boy it was awesome...the picture was great..(internet)....evrything was fine until about a month after i noticed that it would just shut down..then i would try to turn it back on and it wouldnt..so it takes for me to unplug for a few min then restart..since then it still shuts down..or freezez...i think that this item in general is defective..i noticed other people had the same problem..as of right now im waiting for my replacement..."
5,Samsung comes through again.,"Sure its a more expensive product, compared to other comparable, or supposedly comparable products, however, you get what you pay for. In this era of mass everything and relatively shoddy quality it is good to see that Samsung, at least from my experience, walks the talk in product quality.Very good viewing, very good set up, no problems, no drama, ahhhhhh, the price of luxury i guess!"
3,Mediocre,"It does the job for a PC. Picture is sharp. But for hooking it up to satellite or cable, the picture is greating lacking in quality."
2,bad power suplly,i bought this 18 months ago. i purchased a refurb unitwell about 2 months ago the ps started to act up.$90.00 later it's working again. Many people have experienced this problem with the ps
2,10 Minutes of Heaven,"I bought a brand new Roadtrek Motorhome that came equipped with this unit. It was hooked up to a TV antenna and a DVD player and Dolby Surround Sound, but had room for several more component and HD connections.It worked nicely with the integrated system in the Motorhome... for about 10 minutes. It died, no power whatsoever. I tried outside power, etc., no help.I tried the Samsung website to register it, but it was a Canadian model (where the Motorhome was built), and I couldn't register it on the US site, nor could I register it on the Canadian site since it only allows you to enter Provinces, not States.However, I did call Samsung the next day, they asked for the Serial Number, and that was all it took for them to send a replacement to a local UPS store. Alas, my trip is already planned, so I won't get it till I return, but I am very pleased with the Customer Service and only hope the next unit (re manufactured) works."
3,Was good...but then...,"I've had this monitor for 3 months and it was fine. Watching standard TV wasn't the best-the image just wasn't too clear in widescreen mode. I do like the Picture-in-picture mode, so I could watch SportsCenter while checking my e-mail. It looks great when I use it with my XBox 360 too.But then...as I saw in some of the other reviews, I was having problems with it not turning on/off and today, it finally died. No response from it at all. Customer service seemed helpful and now I'm waiting for a new one. If not for this issue I'd have given this monitor 4 stars. We'll see if the new one is any better."
1,HATE IT!!!!,"This is the worst monitor ever. We bought 2 of these at the same time and have had nothing but problems. We use them for tv and computer monitor. These have both had to have the bulbs replaced twice!!! The first time was within the first 6 months. Now after 1.5 years of owning it, I can't wait to take it to the DUMP!!!"
3,Poorly Written,"The original 1941 version of The Flying Express was a poorly written book in certain respects. The book is very slightly disjointed in places and perhaps more to the point it contains several glaring errors all too well known to most Hardy enthusiasts - ie: The incorrect names given for Mrs. Hardy & Chief Collig. That said and those things aside this was a pretty good book. As I child I held this book in high esteem. It is a story about spies using a train called the Flying Express. It is the brothers task to find the spies and their camp and bring them to justice. It is too bad the book contains several errors because otherwise it had a great plot and was an enjoyable read. More accurately I rate it a 3.4 star, the story a 4 star, the errors within a 2 star. RATED B-REVISION: The 1970 revision - from memory was a dud. I may not be the best person to rate the revision. I can simply say I read it once and was not impressed. Its worth reading, but ranks among the bottom dwellers."
3,An Average Book,"This review concerns the revised 1970 edition. When a new hydrofoil is set to begin taking passengers between Bayport and Cape Cutlass, its owner, fearing sabotage from angry boat owners, asks Frank and Joe to come along on its maiden voyage. Arriving in Cape Cutlass, Frank and Joe also, try to help their father with his case concerning a gang that has been stealing boating supplies. I hate reviewing books like this one because there really isn't much to say. The book was neither excellent nor bad; just average. The mystery isn't one of the better ones; however , it is not boring either. I don't think that most fans of the series would rank this book as one of their favourites, but I don't believe that many fans would be disappointed with the book either."
4,Dear Mr. Dixon,"Dear Mr. Dixon,Hi, I'm a big, big fan of yours. I just absolutely loved your Flying Express book. It was great when Frank was pushed overboard and had to hang over the the blades for thirty seconds when his hands were really wet. Whew! It was a surprise when you found out Big Malarky, who seemed like a good man (But really wasn't) turned out to be behind the whole scam. I liked how Chet was turning into an Astrologer every time he met the Hardy Boys. I also liked how Zig who was the gangleader, liked Astrology, just like Chet. My favorite part was when the Hardy's found they're boat and Skee didn't know it belonged to them and let them test drive it but he ended up being arrested on the dock. I just wanted to congratulate you on this book and hope you keep on writing more fantastic books.Your fan,(***)"
5,"A Powerful Tale on Life, Friendship and Tragedy","If you're a comics buff who's only into superheros or manga or whatever popular subjects featured in mainstream comics, this book is probably not for you, regardless of the glowing reviews here. Otherwise ... read on.I utterly enjoyed the book. The story is so intense, yet the illustration is minimalistic and poetic. Because of the frugal use of text, I had to revisit some pages just to interpret what exactly happened. But I'm telling you - less is more! The book has the rare quality and artistic appeal of a Criterion Collection classic film. It also reminded me of Art Spiegelman's Maus. If Maus has been studied in schools, Hey Wait should be, too. I hope, through word of mouth, this book as well as others by Jason will get more attention in the States."
1,I hated this book,"I purchased this book based on the praise given in other reviews. I'm pretty well in touch with my feelings, but this book just didn't do it for me. The progression is disjointed and somewhat hard to follow and the portions that should have been emotional didn't really resonate with me. I also finished this in no more than thirty minutes. Overall, I'm just not pleased with this one."
4,A solid collection,"I am puzzled by the acidity of the review by ""J Onyx"", who contrasts the supposedly unscholarly and ""Marxist"" authors of this collection with the scholarly ""gentleman"" Robert Bremner, who wrote various works on the history of American Philanthropy. J Onyx even speculates that these historians waited until Professor Bremner was gone before they published their writings.I was one of Professor Bremner's graduate students at Ohio State and assisted him with his revision of his classic work American Philanthropy. Bob Bremner was indeed a gentleman, and he treated other scholars with an irenic spirit even when he disagreed with them. It is impossible for me to imagine Bob Bremner being so uncharitable of other scholars as J Onyx, or engaging in such an acerbic and inaccurate misrepresentation of a work.This is an important collection of well-researched essays. Anybody interested in the role of philanthropy in American history must begin with this volume."
5,wow it really does help... alot,this stuff has really extended the life of my skate shoes... and it also has worked to repair some old slippers that had come apart. this is great buy for any skater for sure.
1,Didn't meet expectations,"I purchased this product expecting to save some of the shoes with soles that have dry rotted here in the Caribbean and the Shoe Goo wouldn't stay. I tried with several pairs of shoes, from tennis shoes to sandals and the results were poor in all the cases."
3,Didn't really work for me,"Not sure if I did something wrong... but I have some golf sneakers that the soles came loose from sitting in my car (hot Florida sun). So I used this on it... and they lasted a week or two before one of the soles came loose again.I put the ""goo"" on and let it set for probably a week before I used the sneakers again. Again, not sure if I did something wrong or what. I would give it a 1 star, but it could be my fault."
4,Longer Lasting Shoes,"This is a good product if you have shoes that are worn at the heel but are otherwise still in pretty good condition. Instead of throwing them away and buying a new pair, this will save you money by rebuilding the worn heels and other areas. You can get some more mileage out of the shoe. Be sure to apply in a well ventilated area because the goo stinks, but it's okay once it dries."
3,Not that impressing!,"Did not glue my shoes well. The sole came apart from the shoe. I guess it depends on the need, but it could be much stronger!"
5,Great Product with a Short Shelf Life,"This is a terrific item to keep just about any sensible shoe and sandal bottom from wearing out too quickly. I've had great success with it.Unless you are going to doctor-up a lot of needy shoes, athletic ones in particular, at one time, buy the smaller Shoe Goo size. Shoe Goo stored over an extended period of time loses most of its potency."
5,Shoe Goo Review :),"Great product! When my sneakers start to lose their soles, I reach for the Shoe Goo. Makes a permanent repair that stays flexible. Saves me from buying an expensive new pair of sneaks."
5,Very good product!,I bought this goo for my son to repair his skating shoes; his shoes get damaged quite often. He used it to repair one pair and it did its job!!! He's happy!
1,not what I expected,"I bought this product to repair the rand on my hiking boot. It went on easily, but after it dried, it peeled right off the leather part of the boot,and I was able to peel it off the rest. The product was also shiny, very unlike the original rand. I followed the directions for cleaning the boot prior to application."
3,"Messy, hard to apply",I applied this to a part of my shoe that was coming apart and it was really messy and didn't stick very well I had to hold it together for along time before it even stuck a little bit. I'll give it another go because you get a lot of glue.
1,Did not stick to the shoe!,"DO NOT BUY THIS... it does not repair shoes. :( We bought it hoping to fix 3 - 4 pairs of shoes. But it did not glue the sole of the shoe back on to the shoe at all. I am not sure if there is a trick we missed, but it did not work. We followed all the instructions on the package... and still failed. Save your money and buy a good new pair of shoes."
1,disappointed,HAD A PAIR OF NIKE SHOX THAT THE SOLE HAD SEPARATED SOME. PURCHASED SHOE GOO. APPLIED AND CLAMPED FOR 48HRS. ONCE CLAMP REMOVED SOLE SEPARATED IMMEDIATELY. GOO DOES NOT WORK!!!!!
2,look out for the explosion,squezing the tube watch out for the back of the tube blowing out and getting goo all on u
4,shoe goo rating,this is a specific use product that I have used for over 20 years. Unfortunatly I cannot seem to find it in the original BLACK color. Shoe Goo still performs as it did in the black color but I do not care for the clear.
4,Shoo Goo,"My son, who is a skater, needed something to repair his favorite skate shoes, duct tape just didn't look good! He saw a video recommending Shoo Goo, it sounded like just the thing we needed to fix his shoes, so we tried it. It worked great, but I wish that I had chosen the clear, as I chose black and the result was less than I expected. I will definitely buy this product again, but I will choose clear instead of black!"
5,Fantastic shoe repair,"My entire family has used this product since the seventies, and it is JUST AS GREAT as it originally was. You can repair shoe soles for your favorite running shoes, slippers, any rubber-soled shoes. You can put rubber on the bottoms of walking canes for stage, real life, etc. This is like rubber cement repair, only one hundred times better. Do you get the picture?"
4,Shoe Goo,"Shoe Goo works great. The bottom of my tennis shoe was peeling. I applied some shoe goo and glued the sole back on and let it dry 24 hours. Next day the tennis shoe was good. Shoe Goo really works! For the size, I should buy a smaller Shoe Goo."
3,Its good but somehow lacks the punch from their sixties live performances,"Although this double album has very good recordings and clear sound, for me this compilation of live performances (from 1999 to 2002)don't have the same energy and punch from the early 60's. If you are new to The Ventures I rather recommend ""The Ventures Live in Japan '65""."
5,Interesting for the stories if not the recipes!,"I bought this for my daughter as a gift, but when it arrived, I had a hard time parting with it!I especially enjoyed all the history in the book, very facinating, and have made quite a few recipes from it, all turning out wonderfully.Beautiful coffee table book as well."
2,Well...,"The writing style was fine, but I didn't find it interesting in the least. It may be a classic, but it really didn't do anything for me."
3,A good gift for the value,"I purchased this necklace as a gift. At the amount it is was discounted, I thought I would be getting the most amazing deal for the price. The necklace I recieved was as pictured, but the stones where smaller than I believed them to be.The necklace is pretty, delicate, and was still a nice gift. The stones are a very nice light blue color. However, the original price before discount was extremely overinflated. I would never in a million paid over $150 for this necklace. The necklace doesn't look expensive, and the links made them look moderately cheap. My price (about $30) was probably the correct value, disguised as a deep discount."
2,Sparkly and pretty...,"but when you put the necklace on, you can't even see either the sparkle, or the beauty of it. The stones are very small, which is expected. What is not expected is that the stones are linked by 3...(Meaning, 3 stones seem to be soldered together, then connected to 3 more stones, etc.) This made for an awkward appearance when worn since it's not ""fluid."" In other words, the necklace would ""flip"" constantly, and all you saw was silver and not the ""topaz.""I considered keeping it anyways because the price was great, the stones are sparkly and the color pretty, but the 18"" wouldnt fit 3x around my wrist (2x made it too large) to be worn as a bracelet of some sorts.Unfortunately, this will have to go back. I wish it was better designed for more movement of each stone so that it laid better against the skin."
1,Sterling silver blur topaz necklace,"Poorly made, washed out stones. Cannot use for gifts because the quality is so terrible. Would have returned but missed return deadline due to travel. Stuck with them."
4,Great Item. Great Service.,"Very nicely constructed, and the service from the seller was truly rare in it's excellence and personally professionaly touch.The zafu was a tiny bit smaller than I expected, but it was exactly what it should have been. It was my expectation that was off. Great item."
4,Uplifting,"I watched this film on a cold saturday night with my 90 year-old grandfather by a warming fire and we were both entranced. After only having seen Love-Hewitt playing teeny boppers and angst-ridden soap stars, this was a refreshign and well-deserved change. She took on the mammoth task of playing one of the world's finest and best know stars graciously and played it to her ability. The most moving parts were her childhood. Frances fisher brought her usual grace and dignity to the part of Audrey's mother and complemented Love-Hewitt perfectly. All in all, a perfect rainy day film and a typical chick-flick!"
4,I Loved the Story if nothing else,"I thought that honoring Audrey Hepburn was a wonderful idea and ever since I found out about the special, I had wanted to see it. Although, in the beginning, I did not particularly like Hewitt's interpretation of Audrey, after I watched it a few more times, her performance grew on me. I now find myself watching the tape weekend after weekend, hanging on her every word, waiting to see what happens next.(even though I have it memorized.) The story is amazing with all the different love struggles that she goes through. My favorite moments are all her proposals and break ups. I think that anyone who likes a good Romantic flick would love this movie. It is definately worth the watching."
1,Can this BE any more wrong?,"As a huge Audrey fan I was disgusted to see that Jennifer Love Hewit was cast to play Audrey in a biopic. Not only does JLH not resemble Audrey in any way but JLH can't act at all, in any fashion. I see this as just another chance for JLH to be overexposed as something she is not (i.e. actress, singer.) If you buy this i recomend burning it when your done."
3,Give Ms Hewitt some credit,"Obviously, Jennifer Love Hewitt has great respect and love for Ms Hepburn, and she should get some credit for taking such a risk. But Audrey is more than an actress, she's an icon, and anyone taking on such a role is bound to offend some people. I was not familiar with Jennifer Love Hewitt's previous work, but I am eager to check it out. She certainly is beautiful and has screen presence, but she is not Audey Hepburn, at least not yet. Ms Hewitt is miscast and it's ironic that the movie takes place during the filming of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", a movie for which Ms Hepburn was miscast. My real objection to the movie isn't the casting or the acting, it's the way the movie was plotted. The subject-looking-back-on his/her-life plot has become a cliche. Someone needs to put some new life into the biography movie."
2,Jennifer Love Hewitt flops as Audrey Hepburn,Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't look a thing like Audrey Hepburn. I truely believe that the producers and casting directors made a terrible call casting Hewitt. The actress who I believe reminds people of Audrey as well as looks like her is Natalie Portman (who is an exceptional actress). Natalie would have made a much mcuh better Audrey Hepburn.
3,Good but not Great,This movie started out slow and bad.It eventually got a little better but not much.It was a bit of a disappointment.I feel that it was not 100 percent accurate and it was rather rushed.It told of Audrey Hepburn's childhood then went to her acting career then back to her childhood.I really like Audrey Hepburn as an actress but not this movie.So I recommend that you see one of her movies instead of this one but if you wish to see it don't let this review stop you.Hope this review helped.
1,Can we give something zero stars?,"Didn't anyone have the courage to tell the puzzlingly popular Jennifer Love Hewitt that she was just wrong for this role? By the way, Audrey Hepburn's career did not end after Breakfast At Tiffany's. Zero stars! ZERO!"
1,Why did she think she could play Audrey Hepburn?,"Jennifer Love Hewit is realy just a fad so her trying play a legend is just seems realy silly. For while I actually liked JLH well maybey not like but I could stand her after seeing this movie i lost all resepct for her. I don't think any one could play her, though I think Winona Ryder in some ways reminds me of her though doubt she'd do a TV movie. Jennifer Love Hewit maybe admires Audrey Hepburn but I still think doing this movey was bad idea. She could of helped UNACEF that's what Audrey Hepburn probaly would want to be remebered for. They didn't mention that at all (okay five second of UNACEF) they only showed two films she made and Audrey Hepburned made 27. I fond this flim very insulting to Audrey Hepburn fans."
1,Why Did They Choose HER?!,"I saw this movie on television. I was really excited because I thought it would be interesting and Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses. Well...This movie was AWFUL!! Why on earth would they pick Jennifer Hewitt to play Audrey Hepburn. Natile Portman might have been a better choice. As others said, the girl who played the younger Audrey did a pretty good job. Perhaps Miss Hewitt is a better actress in other shows and movies, but not this time. This movie could almost be classified as a comedy! She didn't even keep up her fake Audrey voice throughout the entire movie,and when she did use it she sounded like Audrey with one word 'CAT'.The actors who played Gregory Peck and William Holden were a joke; they were awful and didn't look or sound like either Peck or Holden. The movie showed none of Audrey's later life. If you missed seeing this on television,you didn't miss much. If you still want to see this, rent it; you might be sorry if you buy it first."
3,Good but not Great,This movie started out slow and not very good. It got a little bit better but not much. It was a bit of a disappointment.I felt that it was rushed and not 100 percent accurate.The movie talked about her childhood then her acting career then her childhood then her love life so it could get confusing.I felt it was a little over dramatic like a soap opera.There were disputes over Jennifer Love Hewitt playing Audrey but she did pretty good but no one can really play Audrey except Audrey herself.I really do like Audrey Hepburn as an actress but I do not like this movie as much as I like her.I suggest you watch her movies instead of this but if you wish to see this do not let my review stop you.I hope I helped.
4,Beginning with Audrey growing up during WWII brought integrity.,I learned a lot about Audrey Hepburn's childhood that I had never realized before. Beginning in WWII brought the story home and made it real.
2,Not at all Audrey Hepburn,"JLH did a terrible job at portraying Audrey Hepburn. She seemed depressed most of the time and the insecurity depiction was too much. JLH looks NOTHING like Miss Hepburn so I don't konw why she was given that part. She does not have the elegance or the grace of Miss Hepburn, and she did this head shaking thing waay too much. Her accent was off most of the time, and her singing (although it's good) sounded nothing like Miss Hepburn. They should have played a recording instead! Overall, I was disappointed and, as others have already said, Natalie Portman would have been a much better Miss Hepburn."
2,Not Audrey quality acting!!!!!!!!!,"Sadly, this movie is suppose to be the story of one of the greatest acting and fashion legends of ""all time"". This movie is so poorly done, it is in no way an honor or tribute to Audrey Hepburn.Being the acting and content of this story is so poor, the smart thing to do is proceed to Amazon books and order, ""Enchantment: The Life of Audrey Hepburn""."
1,Nuh uh...,"I could not get passed the fact during the whole movie that it was Love Hewitt ACTING as Audrey. I did not get into the role at all. The accent was off and everything. I spent the whole 3 hours sitting there not watching the movie, but only pressing pause during the commercial; thinking I might actually want to watch it later. They better put one of Audrey's other movies on the DVD along with it in order for me to buy it."
4,I Was Enchanted,"I found this film and especially the performance of its lead actor Hewett to be absolutely enchanting. Born in 1960, I grew up with an awareness of Audrey Hepburn, but this TV tribute truly introduced me to the magic of the star. I commend Jennifer Love Hewitt on her performance and thank her for reacquinting me with Audrey. I've recently ordered 8 of the classic Hepburn movies so that I might truly experience the beautiful actress and fascinating culture of her days (and, later, mine). For me, this film accomplished its likely objective: I have come to appreciate Audrey Hepburn in a much greater way. Well done. Buy the video and avoid the commercials on the TV."
1,Faye shoulda won an Oscar for Mommie Dearest...,"...compared to this piece of tripe.A lot of people (including me) thought Audrey slaughtered the film version of My Fair Lady. Personally, I forgave Audrey for that error long ago. Is this movie her payback?Jennifer, get over your self. Your a horrid actress. I cannot believe you have gotten as far as you have in your career. I never thought anyone could miscast THEMSELVES.Since JLH played Audrey, here's some suggestions for future movies about legendary actresses...Starr Jones as Bette DavisCindy Crawford as Katherine HepburnRosanne as Marlene DietrichBea Arthur as Marilyn MonroeElizabeth Berkley as Ethel MermanTori Spelling as Judy GarlandIf JLH can play Audrey, then my list is very plausable."
1,terrible,Don't bother watching this movie. The facts are all wrong. The acting is not all that god. JLH tries her best but falls flat on her face. If you want to learn about Audrey read on of the many books written on her or watch the A&E biography.
4,"Great Story, but Jennifer is no Audrey","Jennifer did a good job portraying the beautiful and legendary Audrey, but again she is no Audrey Hepburn. I enjoyed the story very much and was able to get passed the fact that the resemblance or voice was not exactly like Audrey's. I do recommend it for the story itself, which was heartwarming, but if you are expecting to see an exact duplicate of Audrey, then rent some of Audrey's old films. ."
5,Such a great album,This is just such a classic album. Aloe Blacc finds the right mix of electro-funk and classic hip-hop to make an album diverse in sound. Highly recommended from a hip-hop head.
1,very disappointing,"The description of JonBenet Ramsey case is very lengthy, detailed and so boooooring (already known from the media !)The ""psychic part"" of this chapter is short, just 2 pages. Short and disappointing, author writes: ""I don't claim to know who did it ...""That's it."
3,Do Your Homework,"He Did not do his homework, I borrowed this book from a friend and the man has nothing new to say on any case. He knows nothing about Miss Lizzie Borden, I bet he doesn't even know her birthday or when the crimes where commited, or her middle name, or when she died, or what she died of, or her history. The man needs to read my book when It's finished I have all the answers he doesn't know (except who really did it just because its unsolved) A I right people?"
3,I'm of two minds on this book...,"First off, this book is a fascinating read - John Douglas has taken some of the most fascinating cases in crime history, and offered compelling arguments and evidence for, or against, the accuseds in each case. I love true-crime books, and this one is very interesting, with its descriptions of what evidence the authorities had to work with.But on the other hand; it's when he goes off on one of his tangents; that if the authorities had done ""this, this, and this"", and if he had been around to have his hand in the older cases, he would have had the cases locked up. It's easy to criticize from a distance of years; but I'll bet there were quite a few competent investigators on the case, who did the best they could with what they had at the time.The author's shameless patting himself on the back in his books is incredibly annoying, to the point where I just fast-forward past it to the objective parts."
4,He profiles the classics . . .,"but doesn't necessarily shed new light on them. The first difficulty is Mr. Douglas's massive ego. The second problem is that, regardless of how unbiased he thinks he is, he cannot look at these cases with a fresh eye. I found myself disagreeing with almost all of his ""most likely"" suspects and felt that he disregarded relevant information because it didn't fit his theories. I do think that if Mr. Douglas had profiled these cases with no preconceived notions, the outcome would have been significantly different.The book is an interesting look at several famous cases, but don't expect to know whodunit when you finish this book."
4,A Good Read,"A very good book, hard to put down. I was hoping Mr. Douglas was going to tell us the who-dun-it in each case, but most of the cases are very old, and instead, he told us how he would have handled them with today's technology and personality profiling. Still, very interesting."
5,Very interesting,This book has informed me of things I have never known. I watch a lot of crime shows but Mark and John go behind the scenes and explain how the actual process works. The difficulties of solving a crime and making sure you have the right person. Very interesting read. Could not put it down.
4,Good insights,"If you're looking for good insights on criminal behaviour, this is it. I liked it and learned a few things I hadn't already explored."
4,Fascinating reading,"I like true-crime analysis and the older cases were interesting....Details were given and opinions were explored as were possible suspects. I felt sorry for Charles Lindbergh and his wife. The Ramsey case still baffles me and the ""police procedures gone wrong"" is a scary thought... It made me wonder if a lot of the killers had actually really died or if they are still lurking out there wanting to kill again."
2,curious explanations of behavior,"Too many statements of duratiion of time profiling with clear poor grasp of human behavior. ""No mother would act this way."" Vain, aging beauty queen mothers facing their 40th birthday with a history of dolling up in tights and rouge their preschool age children can probably be suspected of behavior slightly different from the norm. Interesting cases presented, but interpretations of behaviors are superficial, lack insight, lack curiosity. Why did Patsy Ramsey sit unmoved on the sofa while others with her reacted to screams from the basement--Duh.. No clear answer to who would sit and compose lengthy note without worry of discovery--Duh. I am inspired to seek other authors for insights."
2,Murder will out (sell),"Wait for the paperback. This book is a rehash of earlier works. It may be interesting to those who don't know much about profiling. However, Mindhunter is a much better book than this recycled effort, which seems to have been written primarily to justify his support of the Ramseys. Regarding the Ramsey case, he presents a few credible scenarios incriminating Paty and/or John, and then immediately dismisses them as ""absurd"". His ego seems to have created quite a blind spot."
4,cases that haunt us...,i thought this book had alot of info on the crimes and suspects. i didn't necessarily agree with the author's input on the jon benet ramsey murder but it's still a good read. this book makes you want to protect your children more ;)
3,HALF CORRECT.......,"THE WORLD RENOWNED DOUGLAS RELIES TOO HEAVILY ON THE ''RESEARCH''OF OTHER WRITERS IN FORMING OPINIONS..........SOME OF IT IS THINLY DISGUISED FICTION,AS IN JOHN GILMORE'S ''SEVERED''(THE BLACK DAHLIA),OR ROBERT GRAYSMITH'S EPONYMOUS ''ZODIAC''.........SOMETIMES HE'S RIGHT ON TARGET(LIZZIE),REAL CLOSE(JACK THE RIPPER),OR,AND I'M SURE MOST WILL AGREE,TOTALLY WRONG(JON BENET)........DOUGLAS DID NOT DO HIS HOMEWORK CORRECTLY HERE,AND SOMETIMES IT SHOWS BADLY.........OF COURSE,WITH SOME OF THESE ANCIENT CRIMES,IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO SEPERATE FACT FROM SPECULATION ANYMORE?.........OTHER WRITERS HAVE DEVOTED YEARS OF THEIR LIVES TO SOME OF THESE CASES,AND THEY'RE TOTALLY LOST,SOMETIMES.......MAYBE THE COMPLEXITY INVOLVED W/ MOST CASES PRESENTED HERE DEFIES ENCAPSULATION,WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THIS BOOK PROVIDES.........JOHN DOUGLAS SHOULD STICK TO THE FRESH CRIMES OUT THERE,ITS TOO LATE FOR THE HOPELESSLY DISTORTED ONES HERE........."
1,an open letter,"Mr. Douglas has done a great disservice to his profession by his work on the JonBenet Ramsey case. His self-serving and patronizing chapter on the case is incredible. I knew very little about the case before reading this book, and Mr. Douglas certainly offered no credible insight into the matter. There are so many holes in his theories that I am compelled to completely disregard his opinion as entirely motivated by ego. Others have defended his integrity by pointing out that at some point in the case he refused payment for his services, but it sure was useful to have the Ramsey's cooperation for the purpose of writing this book, for example."
2,Boring but had many details,I thought this book was very boring. I was only fascinated with the details of the cases. I think it was poorly written.
2,"General Overview of Bizarre Cases, too obtuse for crime scholars.","A Dummy's Guide to Understanding Bizarre Murder Cases.-I would read this if you were a new immigrant to the Western world. So, i would look around for weightier books ,on a specific crime topic.This book is too broad and not informative enough .The reason why these cases haunt the FBI is that they need to turn on the light-switch."
3,Unscientific and Self-Contradictory,"As has been noted, the Ramsey case has been written up in such a biased manner, it should have been placed first so the reader can wonder about what information has been left out in the other cases. The book comes across as self-justifying, as reviews have said. In the Borden case: ""From my experience, there is no way a stranger would..."" and ""Even a maniac wouldn't hang around for ninety minutes, and he would have killed Lizzie and Bridget too."" Yet in the Ramsey case, he makes the claim for just such behavior. Despite the classifications of ""organized/disorganized/mixed"" behavioural characteristics, there's mostly a lot of arm-waving and building assumptions upon assumptions upon assumptions...though I admit many of his conclusions are likely right, the arguments to get there aren't airtight. And where's the followup discussion of Jeff Merrick, etc....?"
5,Douglas and Olshaker Kick Ass Again,"This is a great book that any person interested in psychology should have. I know detectives and psychologists who delight in the interesting way that Douglas makes the wisdom of the FBI available to readers. The United States has spent millions of dollars in researching the psychology of criminal behavior, so it should be of no surprize that so much quality information exists. Douglas and Olshaker are doing an excellent job at disseminating this information in a fascinating way. Researchers in other human behaviors should take note of the massive work done by the United States into the criminal mind."
5,Great Book!,One of the best books I've ever read and everyone should read it to clear up any misconceptions they have regarding any of the cases mentioned in the book. I refer to it often when one of the cases pops back into the news or I hear a new theory regarding any of the cases.
3,old crime case studies,"Detailed book, lots of speculation, pretty interesting, but has many old cases, such as the Lizzie Borden murder, the Lindberg kidnapping, etc.Not as insightful as his other books, nor as interesting."
4,Good crime book,"Interesting investigations into the most famous crimes of the past centurys up until recently. The author analyzes, investigates and tells us about the victims of the most popular and notorious murder cases. Some of the cases he investigates are the jon benet ramsey murder, the lindbergh baby kidnapping, the zodiac killer and more. Tons of interesting info and a highly enjoyable read. 4 stars/ good for anyone interested in crime/murder investigations."
2,John Douglas blows it with the chapter on the Ramsey murder.,"I'll try to make it short and sweet: good book that is ultimately marred by a terrible chapter on the JonBenet Ramsey murder. For most of the chapter, Mr. Douglas spends his time attacking the theories (and character) of other credible law enforcement officials who have called him out for the illogical findings he presented while being paid by the Ramsey's lawyers. Frankly, it's a little embarrassing. You blew it, John...and you know it.Just glad to see others posting similar comments about the final (and regrettable chapter) of this book. It's amazing to see someone with so much skill and experience really just, well, crap the bed like this."
5,At last! After so many years...,"This album was originally relased on Virgin records about 1976 and it was playing all over London for about a year. Delroy was working as Bob Marley's road manager at the time. The backing band ISUS consisted of the solid drum and bass from what later became ASWAD. First time I ever went into a studio in London - I was 16 and it was with Delroy who was recording with The Cimmarons a song called ""Walking Down Lonely Street"" :o) - that was 30 years ago! Anyway - I just ordered this and it's worth it for the first track alone called ""Jah Wonderful"" - a tune that stuck in my head to this day. Delroy! Those were the days!"
4,Works with the iPhone 3G,This battery pack has a USB port that I can confirm works with the iPhone 3G.The battery is a 1200 mAh NiMH battery that should just about charge an iPhone 3G from 0% to 100%.
1,Junk mostly,"I bought on of these for $5 in the bargain aisle of wal mart, I bought it just for kicks to see if it would charge my Zune, I was happy to see that it did start to charge my zune and was very happy at that point, thinking that I had finally found a USB charger for my wonderful Zune, Turns out there are 2 major problems here, this unit it way to heavy to carry around on only charged my Zune for about 5 - 10 minutes. I figured that I could always take the whole unit apart and wire it up to the 14.7V system of a car, nope, the battery pack inside is only a 9.6V pack, bad things could happen if you hooked it to 14.7v.For an 1800Mha pack, it should give more than a 10 minute charge."
1,A heavy brick,"I haven't even removed this from the packaging - it's being returned.This is not a pocket-anything, it's a large heavy brick. Definitely not something to 'slip in your purse'.I'm giving it one star because of the misleading description."
1,"Defective, junk","My unit will charge, and power on. However it completely discharges in less then 10 minutes when charging my ipod. This has a 1200mAh battery in it. A 30gb 5th gen ipod has a 450mAh battery. You should be able to get 2 complete charges on your ipod, but my unit wont even get 1/4 of a charge."
1,Not so great,"I didn't buy this from Amazon, but mine is just not useable. As others have noted, it is quite a bit larger than I expected. Also, it seems to charge, the lights come on normally, but it will not charge anything. It won't work on my iPhone thru the USB port, and the AC port won't power an external hard drive.Mine may just be defective, but since I only paid $11 for it, it's just not worth pursuing a repair or replacement to me. However, just beware that it may not provide enough power to charge anything other than basic cell phones."
1,Beware! You're buying old inventory!,"When new, these were great, but everything being offered for sale now has been sitting on the shelf for a very long time, years in fact. Batteries this old cannot be charged up again. You're just buying a paperweight!"
1,Not good at all,I got one of these a year ago. The issue I had was that the thing only had about 15mins of power before shutting down. That is usb or powering a 7w fluorescent bulb AC.
2,350 mah,"I bought this hoping to use it with my archos 630 video player. Sadly it doesn't even add more than 30 mins of playback time. Its made for less demanding electronics like phones, pda's etc... I wouldn't use this for portable dvd players or video players. Its rated draw power is about 350 mah."
1,usless,"DEAD!!!! to long before i use it,they wont take it, dont know what else to say dont know what else to say"
4,My wife loves it,"The stones are a bit small, and not as colorful as the picture, but the necklace is beautiful and well made. Interesting clasp with a non-rolling chain. Nice."
4,Ear Candy,For someone who likes smooth chill out music with an equal amount of sexy R&B and smooth hook laden pop this is a must own single to add to your collection.
5,A cult classic of a song,"This song has the whole package. It's catchy, fun and infectious. The type of song that everyone is listening to. Cassie definately has enough potential to go far in the music industry."
1,"This Isn't A ""Summer Jam""","Summer Jams are memorable- just think of ""Hollaback Girl"" by Gwen Stefani and ""Oh"" by Ciara. This song by Cassie is TOTALLY forgettable. When I first heard ""Me & U"" I thought it was just okay. But after hearing 2, 3, 4,. . ., nth times, I decided that this song was weak. The music sounds like it is looped and Cassie sings like she's half asleep. There is no emotion or intensity in this song at all. NONE. It's just bland and dreary. But I guess it's just a sample of what's more to come on her upcoming album. Anywho, this song has already been forgotten like a bowl of Ramen Noodles with hot sauce when checks come out."
1,SKIPPING CD'S,MY CD OF CASSIE'S ME AND YOU SKIPS THROUGHOUT THE CD. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I'VE RECEIVED A CD FROM AMAZON THAT HAS SKIPPED. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I ORDER ANY CD'S FROM AMAZON. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS I FEEL I'VE SPENT MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS.THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!
4,Relaxing song with a great beat,"I first heard this song in my car on the radio and it was the smooth whistle melody and sythesized bass that caught my attention the most. It's one of those songs that you want to turn up your bass and just sit back and relax to. The vocals are are nothing special, but the instrumental alone is what gives this song its unique vibe. I'm excited to see what the rest of the album offers."
3,A nice $3.49 coaster. She need to take her * back to myspace,"I wish I could give this BS cd a damn -5 stars. The only good thing about Cassie is her looks. I downloaded this junk off of file-sharing. And I want my money back. That's just how * up this cd is... The only reason I gave this cd 3 stars is because, she's sexy then a mug. It's a * shame that they just wasted a nice piece of technology (CD) on her voice. She need to take her * back to myspace and leave the singing up to the folks that know how."
1,Ew,"Cassie is so bad, she has to resort to stripping down to her panties in her video clip to get music sales. You all know that she has definately got no talent at all, and you only like her for her looks. She is just a ashanti, but with even less talent. hahaha. Her voice sounds like she was raised from the dead, because her voice sounds lazy and her song is quite boring. She has got no vocal talent."
5,Simply amazing,This book was advertised as used. I don't know what they used it for but it had never been opened. I'm finding it to be very useful as a guide on how to fully use a table saw. The drawing are excellent and the jigs that I've made so far actually work.
3,"Comprehensive, BUT...........................","Better illustrated than the previous two editions, but there are a remarkable number of errors in the picture captions pertaining to year and model descriptions. Anyone using this as a ""last word"" reference had better look elsewhere."
2,Not as Good as the 2nd Edition,"If you liked the 2nd Editon of the Standard Catalog of Cadillac, you'll undoubtedly be disappointed in this edition. This edition trades LaSalle information and price guide for a few more color photos of Cadillacs. While the LaSalle price guide is gone completely, the Cadillac price guide is unbelievably incomplete, leaving out pricing for 1921 through 1925, 1927-28, 1931 through 1935,38, 1940,46, 47,1950,51,52,1954 through 1958,1960through 1962 - and more. This edition leaves a lot to be desired for the true Cadillac/LaSalle aficionado."
5,A FABULOUS ACOUSTIC TRIP AROUND THE WORLD,"YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY ""ACOUSTIC JOURNEY"". IT TAKES YOU ON A MUSICAL TRIP TO DIVERSE PLACES AROUND THE WORLD AND DELIVERS A MASTERFUL INTERPRETATION OF EACH WORK AS THOUGH IT WERE HIS OWN. MY FAVORITE TUNE ON THE CD IS ""BLUE CHILI"" AND DIMITRI'S TANGO. ""BLUE CHILI"" IS LIKE A SLOW BLUES JAM WITH SOME JAZZY STUFF THROWN IN AS WELL AS SOME ROCK N ROLL RIFFS. ""TANGO EN PARAISO"" IS A WONDERFUL TROPICAL GROOVE THAT MAKES ME WANT TO ORDER A PINA COLADA AND SIT OUT BY THE POOL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO JUST DIGS GOOD MUSIC."
2,among friends,"I have been a contractor for over twenty years, and a fairly successful one at that. Im sitting in my local cigar shop as I do on a regular basis and I meet Harvey (the author), we talk. and he tells me about his book, so I read it. Well im on my fourth reading as of now, and im still picking up new thoughts. I have recomended this book to many fellow contractors, due to the ease of reading and the simple principles that we all forget from time to time. All I can say is great insight and simply stated."
1,meh!,"A little frustrated with the seller on this one. I bought the book and realized I got the wrong one, okay, my fault, but then I tried to contact them to return it and they just ever so not subtly refused to contact me back. Tried a couple times. This book is not good at all. I have the first one, which is amazing, but this one is so not aesthetically appealing to me. The cover made me think it would be a bunch of artists like the first but in this one they are more computer based artist and artists who paint far more loosely. Maybe that would appeal to some, or a lot, I don't know, but for me my work is tighter and this book doesn't inspire me like the first one. Overall, though, seller sucks!"
4,secularism,"What is it anyways? I think the entire premise of this book is based on the history of the concept of secularism and all the definitions associated with it. Because of his legal background, Feldman draws together the cases that have helped shape America's face with the history behind the cases. It is very interesting to see how America's idea of secularism has changed and why. This book is well complimented by Stark and Finke's ""Acts of Faith"" and ""Habits of the Heart"" by Bella et all."
3,"Good background, shaky conclusions","This book has been valuable for my students in terms of providing historic background on the rise of secularism in the US. The conclusion, however is rather flawed and presupposes a level of civility (present or future) among parties that is somewhat naive. A lot of unwarranted ""shoulds""! Other authors (notably William Connolly) raise similar points but in a more considered framework."
2,Vast oversimplification,"Feldman attempts to ""solve"" church/state tensions by dividing the country into two camps -- secularists and evangelicals. This starting premise dooms the book. He has bought into the evangelicals' rhetoric, rather than any actual array of beliefs on these issues. Those in opposition to the evangelicals are not anti-religion, as the term ""secularist"" implies, but rather in the vast majority of circumstances are themselves religious. The debate over relgion in the U.S. cannot be reduced to this simple dichotomy. This is an ivory tower worldview, untouched by empirical reality."
3,God Is God,Very interesting review of many issues surrounding God (whatever you definintion of God is) but comments becomes repetitive after awhile. Many good points are made. Just needs to be condensed.
4,A Very Good Choice,"I found the video results from this camera outstanding; clear and crisp with perfect color. I also found this camera easier to load tape and battery than my old Hitachi Hi-8. However, I find using the controls of this camera somewhat difficult and cumbersome. If you can't afford a Sony Digital Hi-8 camera, I suggest this JVC compact camcorder. With Super VHS-C tape in the camera and Super VHS tape in the JVC VHS recorder, for the price, you can't go wrong."
2,The JVC Camcorder GR-SXM240 Super VHS VHS Compact,"The JVC Camcorder Model GR-SXM240 is one of the best I'veused in years. For the price you pay,you can't beat It.Sharp pictures even in low light conditions. I recommend thisCamcorder for every one to use.There is one problem while charging the battery the main circuitboard smoked. This board cost approx. $205.00. I recommend watching the camcoder when charging."
2,A BAD RISK,"Got this camcorder for christmas 3 yrs.ago.After storing the camcorder for about 1 yr. I charged the battery and when I went to check a tape that I had recorded 14 mos. ago there was no picture on the monitor and the viewfinder.I had sound but no picture.I called the JVC service division and they told me to ship it to them and they would check it out and tell me how much it would cost to fix it.I also went to an authorized JVC repair shop and was told that this was a problem that JVC had know about and that if I send it to the JVC that they would fix it for free.The JVC service division person I spoke to told me that I would have to pay.I am confused and very upset that JVC doesn't standby their product.If I have to by another camcorder,I'd never buy a JVC."
2,Less than average product,"The product works fine, but the quality of the material is pretty cheap. It doesn't have a nice feeling while holding it in your hand.On top of this, the battery compartment door broke the second time I had to replace the battery, so now I have to use it with a scotch tape around it.All in all, I believe there are better deals out there. In particular, try to get a presenter that uses AA or AAA batteries. You can find them anywhere."
4,sizing chart,"This dress is a super cute style & shipped pretty quickly; but I had to exchange it for a smaller size. I went by my 53"" bust, so got the 5x, based on the size/measurement chart. Thought that seemed big, even for a Junior's dress; and sure enough, i just stepped into it without unzipping it, and it was HUGE, falling off of me. The top runs about 3"" bigger than the sizing/measurement chart indicates. Just wanted people to have a better idea of what size to order."
4,Perfect bridesmaid dresses!,We really loved the dresses. They were so affordable and they arrived right away. We did have to return two of them for smaller sizes because i think they run a little big but even the exchange process was painless and we had the new sizes within a week and a half. I would definitely buy from them again.
5,very pleased bride,"I loved the dress! Ive orderd the dress on two seperate times. The first time I orderd it was to see about the sizes, because I read in the reviews that some people felt it was too big/small. I found that the dress really runs true-to-size. Then I orderd the rest of the dresses for my bridesmaids. The dress is made really well, and will hold up. You dont have to worry about it loosing its shape on the bust area because it has parallel stays. Also it is fitted thru the natural natural waist, so again we didnt worry about the other measurments. Honestly I have seen the dress in bridal stores for twice the price, and im glad that I didnt pay the extra price!! The shipping from PacifiPlex was awesome as well. It tells you to expect it in a week or so, and both times it has shown up in under three days!"
4,Bridesmaids dresses,Dresses are very nicely made and for the most part fit good. Read reviews about them running big. This is helpful. I actually had to return and reorder twice but it was very easy and they are very fast! I will submit picture after our event! Thanks! Amazon is great!
3,Color Is WAY off,"The color is not a ""royal blue"" its more of a cornflower blue with a purplish hue. I ordered this as a bridesmaid dress expecting a royal blue color as in the picture."
2,Too small,I ordered this dress and was extremely disappointed. The fit was awful. It was tight around the waist but too large in the bust area. I even ordered the dress size based upon review comments. I didn't have time to exchange it and make needed alterations. Donated it.
3,Order a size smaller,I needed alterations. I think it runs big. Great informal dress for a courthouse wedding. Davids bridal has the same exact style but twice the price. But there you can try it on so you wont neeed alterations.
1,ZERO stars,"I wish there was a way I could give this ZERO stars. The quality is awful. The ""satin"" looks like pleather and the feel is disgustingly cheap.It also does not fit true to size. According to measurements, I fit into a size large. Apparently the tape measure they have at the factory is not the same as mine.Now, I'm stuck with having to find a dress in less than a month."
1,Jen,I ordered according to my size. The dress fit great except for the chest area was EXTREMELY to big and there was no way to alter the dress without ruining the style. Couldn't exchange for smaller size as the rest of the dress fit great.
4,"Beautiful, but size problems","So it should be noted that this is a JUNIOR dress, so the sizing is junior sizing. If you are not a junior, you may need to size up. I ordered a Large and it was too small, so I ordered an XL and it is too big. SO sad because this really is a beautiful dress!! It is well made, and the style is lovely! It comes with a satin shawl. There is some boning in the bodice which helps it to keep its shape."
4,how many dresses do you have in liliac?,"i want 5 of these dresses with a white sash but in liliac i really love the dress pl.us i will be getting married in 5 months!!! this dress took my eyes away it wiuld mean soo much to me if you had more than 1 dress.if you did i would be the HAPPIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD. THIS DRESS IS THE COLOR I WANT AND THE STYLE AND ITS ""FREAKY FABLOUS"" I LOVE IT TO DEATH!!!SIGNED,ALEXANDRA WILLIAMS"
4,So Happy!,"I received the dress in 3 business days. For me, the dress is true to size and a VERY flattering cut. The only thing I have to do is get the sides taken in a notch at the bust line. The fabric quality is great. I'm 5'4 and the dress comes down to mid-shin for me. I love that it comes with detachable spaghetti straps and a shoulder wrap. I'll be wearing this to a company party....but I know that I will wear it again! I'm glad I got this."
3,beautiful but small,"After reading all the reviews... I ordered one size smaller. They must have corrected this issue after so many complaints. The three dresses I purchased 2 in L and 1 XL all fit the bridesmaids waist but was at least 4"" -8"" small in the bust. I had the L girls try on the XL and it still didn't work. I will be returning these asking for 2X and 3X now. I am praying the exchange is processed as quickly as the original. The dresses are very pretty and here's to hoping they arrive in correct sizes in time for the wedding."
3,The size chart is WRONG,"I am impressed by the efficiency of PacificPlex. It's really fast and accurate in shipping the item to me. The order arrived 3 days before the estimated delivery, which blew me off. The order came securely wrapped and everything was in order. When I slipped on the dress, however, it slipped off me. Literally. I had ordered according to the size chart but apparently, after measuring the actual dress with a measuring tape again, the size is TWO INCHES MORE THAN STATED IN THE CHART.Please deduct 2 inches from the size chart should you wish to order this dress. Really beautiful dress, pity about having to go through the trauma of sending it for alterations or return."
3,cute dress,i bought this as a bridesmaid dress. it is a cute dress but when i got the dress it was too small. the bust did not fit so i had to send it back and get the next size up. other than that it was a nice dress and we all looked for the wedding.
4,Made very well considering the cost,The dress was very well made I can not complain about that at all. I knew it was not going to fit when I purchased it based on previous reviews so I expected alterations. But with the money you save the 30 dollars to adjust is nothing.
4,Pretty dress,"Its a very beautiful little brown dress. My only problem is I'm a busty gal, and it doesn't zip all the way in the back, but it fits everywhere else. That's a ""my body"" problem more than a manufacturer problem. Bigger chested women keep that in mind!"
4,look great!,I love these dresses on my bridesmaids! They really like them too. If you want the straps on them you have to sew them in. Not a huge deal but I thought they would have hooks to attach them to.
5,Beautiful bridesmaid dress,"Big thank you to the seller for a very beautiful bridesmaids dresses! The price was reasonable, delivery very quick and customer service was excellent. My bridesmaids will look absolutely beautiful in those dresses next spring at my wedding!"
4,"Great Dress, Even better price","I along with 3 other bridesmaids purchased this dress last summer for my best friends wedding. It looked great on different body types and you can't beat the price. We ALL went a SIZE UP in the dresses. Which is different than some reviewers said. I thought the measurements were accurate but their related size was too big ie. a small should really be called an extra small etc. Even still, I love these dresses so much I think I am going to use them (in different colors of course) for my own wedding!"
2,Little Black Dress Approved,I was trying to find a dress for the military formal for weeks. I had read the reviews for this particular dress and I was afraid it wouldnt fit. After searchinghigh and low for 1 nice dress to wear I just decided to order it and if it neededto be altered I'd do it. It only took 4 days for the dress to be sent to me with regular standard shipping. I tried the dress on and it fit amazingly well. I dontneed to alter a thing. I paid 57.00 total and in a store for something like this I was looking at rediculous prices. I'm going to have to say that I'm very verypleased with this dress and for any other upcoming event I may just buy it again but in a new color. :-)
5,GREAT bridesmaids dress!,"I bought this dress in royal blue at a little shop in the mall for $90. I had a TON of compliments on it during the wedding and felt like I looked great. Because of the boning in the top and flare out bottom, I didn't feel like I needed any kind of girdle or nylons to control my tummy or rear. I just found this dress an Amazon for $40 cheaper and I since I already know how great it is, I am going to buy it again in black for another wedding I am in later this year! TIP: I would recommend buying one size down from the size suggested on the sizing chart. According to my measurements, I should wear an XL but the L fit me just perfectly with a 38"" bust and 31"" waist."
3,"Size scale is off, top slips down","I bought this dress for my daughter's baptism. I had to purchase it twice. The first time, I unfortunately listened to the other reviewers and ordered a dress that was one size smaller than I normally wear. That dress was tiny. I reordered the second dress in the size I wear according to the size chart, and it was still a little snug. Another problem I had was the top kept sliding down so all day, you either saw my bra, or I had to keep fidgeting and picking it up. It was very annoying and I hope you didn't see my bra in any of the pictures. Other than that, it was made out of great material and was a good color. I don't think I would recommend this dress because of the top not staying up issue."
3,red dresses come bigger than other colors...,"Just fair warning, The sizing is not consistent. I ordered this dress in black and red for my bridesmaids, the xl in black fit fine but the red xl fit like a 1x or almost a 2x. I ordered a L in red for the exchange and it looks as though it was a little big for a L but not quite XL size so be advised on that. Also, the fabric is thinner and cheaper than it appears in the pictures, but still a lovely dress especially for the price you are paying. :-) Also, the skirt is quite long maybe about 3 inches below the knee."
3,Inconsistent dresses,"I ordered three of the 50's strapless satin dresses 6 months ago and they were in great condition. I just recently ordered two more and they were not in perfect condition. One had a lot of threads sticking out on the back zipper. On the other dress, the ribbon around the waist was not attached all the way around. I will have to sew that on myself! Also, the sashes that come with the dresses always have a little loop strap to hang it up with, and this sash just had the little strap attached on one side, so it wasn't a loop for hanging. I was dissapointed with the inconsistency of these dresses."
1,was it measured in cm instead of inches?!?,This dress got here about when it was promised but it did not fit at all. I had been measured at a dress shop so I know it wasn't my own error and there's NO WAY I got measured wrong by 8 inches! Just make sure you order bigger than you need.
5,Bridesmaid dress on a budget!!!,"The dress is for my bridesmaids and the style is perfect for a back yard wedding. The satin look doesn't make it look cheap. And the price fits in the budget of all bridesmaids; some in college, just bought a house or have multiple people in my bridal party. I had been looking at some Alfred Angelo dresses in the 148-190 price range.There is only one minor set back. For my wedding design I wanted to replace the bow and ribbon with one of another color and there is no easy wash of removing just that ribbon, it's sewn in through all layers around the zipper. But we found a solution without taking the whole dress apart. We are going to attach the new ribbon to the one already there in the back. (Just in case someone else has the same idea).Overall very worth it!!!!!"
4,prom dress,It is a very lovely dress. I just thought it was going to be a little bit longer. I'm glad it wasn't because i don't need to get it shorten.
4,So happy.,I am very pleased with this dress. I bought it for a reception dress for my wedding in October. I was so happy when it arrived. I tried it on and the only alterations that it needs is taken-in in the bust. I have a very small chest so that was what I expected.It does have a very small snag that is on the stomach region that goes all the way around it. But I don't think its too noticeable. And for the price I can't justify complaining.
4,A little big but still a great dress,"I actually ordered a 2x for my maid of honor though the size chart put her as a small 3x, and it's still a bit big. I think if she had larger breasts it would be fine though. I ordered it knowing it might be too large so I'm not really worried that I have to have it altered. The material is decent. It's certainly not as nice as what you would get for a $200 dress, but it's not anything like pleather as some people have said and it feels just fine. It's pretty much the same quality that you would expect for a $50 dress. I ordered the dress about a week ago so the delivery was pretty fast. It came the exact day that I was told to expect it. We ordered ice blue which looks almost exactly the same as the silver in the photos but it is actually blue which is what I was hoping. I found it really confusing reading so many posts about how the dress ran large and then a few saying it ran small. In my opinion is does run a bit large."
3,Pretty ok dress,"Its a nice dress and it shipped very quickly (I ordered Friday evening and by Wednesday afternoon it had reached it's destination); however I went by the measuring chart provided and ordered by dress based on it and it was far TOOOOOOOOO big. Because its an international order I decided to get the dress taken in (we'll see how well that works out).Overall its a pretty ok dress. I ordered the sage green and it is a beautiful color.My only problem is the measuring chart, so order YOUR size and you should be ok"
4,Beautiful Dress!,"I ordered this for a Christmas Party I will be attending this year. I ordered red, but became worried it would be more of a fire engine red...it actually turned out to be a deeper color and is GORGEOUS! I am absolutely happy with it. It was delivered quickly. I put it on this morning when I received it and it fits perfectly. The only issue I have is wanting a little shape to the bottom, so I'm having a bit of tulle put on the slip so that it will bell out a bit. However, I would recommend it...I'm a pretty big girl and it fits me well and looks great! Thanks!"
4,Perfect for the budget conscious bridesmaid,"I looked high and low for a burnt orange bridesmaid dress with very little success unless I wanted to spend a small fortune. I stumbled upon this lovely dress in pumpkin and both I and the bride found it to be the perfect color and a great simple style. It arrived quickly and painlessly. I took the advice of the other reviewers and completely ignored their size chart. I'm normally a size small top, so that's what I ordered, though my actual measurements are a bit larger than the size small on the chart. The dress fits great and stays up because of the boning. I've seen many of the designer dresses in person and most really aren't made any better or of better materials than this one. It's an amazing value for your money. The only thing that would improve this dress is a lining, though that would drive up the cost. I would highly recommend this dress for bridesmaids. So cute and easy on the wallet, plus it comes in a ton of great colors."
3,Got what I paid for.,"The color of this dress was spot on, baby pink, perfect. The dress itself though, just okay. It was somewhat thin in fabric. The boning in the dress was flimsy. I had to rip out the straps for hanging because they were sewn in at a weird angle and I couldn't hide them while wearing it. The length of the dress was just right also. The sizing I was nervous about when I bought it. SML just doesn't work for this item. Unfortunately I ordered an x-large and it was about 1-1 1/2 sizes too big. If there were a better sizing chart or numbers, that would help greatly! The shipping was very quick though. It left about 3 days after I ordered it and arrived (overseas) about 2 weeks later. For the price, it was good enough. Properly tailored this would be a very lovely dress."
5,A Pocketful of Promises for Women,"I bought this delightful book for my wife, who planned to pass it along to a group of her friends who share special books among themselves. It was so good, I read it myself! And I found it to be spiritually uplifting. Highly recommended!"
2,Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres,"This edition of 'Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres' was unsatisfactory to me.The book's preface (a lead-in to the first chapter) was entirely omitted. The book had no index. The table of contents had no chapter titles. I was giving it as a gift and had to create them myself. These post-modern facsimile editions need such things. My recent purchase of another of Henry Adams' books, Chapters of Erie, has such essential supportive material and was totally satisfactory. If it is omitted, your promotional listing should say so."
1,unusable,"This book was printed in response to my order,i.e., on demand, and the type chosen was so small I did not even attempt to read it. There were no illustrations.I subsequently bought a used copy of the paperback edition which included a brilliant preface, the illustrations, and an exponentially easier format.I threw away the copy purchased from Amazon.Probably my only truly disappointing encounter with Amazon."
1,"The prose is great, the print/binding/print size is truly awful","I have never seen such a lousy printing. Indeed, we received our copy on 31 January 2012--and saw that it had been printed on 27 January 2012. It is impossible to read. The print size is worthy of an opthamologist's chart to determine just how small a size print it is possible for the human eye to read. I do not know how Amazon can even think of selling such a copy of what is a great book. I purchased the book as a gift--I am ashamed to present it."
3,Bit of a surprise,"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres is not a ""fun"" read as advertised. (The Education of Henry Adams was.) I used my imagination as suggested in the intro but still, Chartres reads more like a very intense, detailed short course in architecture, history, philosophy, and religion. Good if that is what the reader is looking for."
4,Dougal and Gammer are easily the best on this album,"There's some very well mixed music on these lovely 3 CDs, and as an avid HH fan I'm in love. Dougal and Gammer (disc 2) are almost overkill in how amazing they are on this CD, it's a total pleasure to listen to hour after hour. It's on loop and I don't realize for the longest time, I'm enjoying it so much.For the beginner getting into happy hardcore, this CD is your gateway."
5,Inspirational Message,The word of God set to music. An inspirational message in every song. Lift your spirits.
2,Doesn't Make It,"The intention is good but the book is spoiled by using gray scale pictures (except for a four page color section out of 700+ pages)which do not illustrate the authors results. One bright note, the author does explain the basics tools and features of PhotoShop Elements clearly but the lack of color detracts too much to make this book worthwhile. There are a lot of books on the subject which do an admirable job and this one comes up short."
3,Where are all the maps?,"This book is a well presented overview of the political history of the Byzantine Empire. Therefore, it suffers from the same problems as most other political history books, it fails to take into account important non-political developments. For instance, the Plague of Justinian is not mentioned. One would thing that a sixty percent mortality rate in Constantinople would earn at least a passing glance. However, the author/publishers are not responsible for the woeful inadquecies of political history. The problem with the book lies in the bizarre lack of maps. (I have the Rutgers University Press, Fourth Paperback Printing, 1995.) There are only two maps (p. 289 and 521). They are both of the Balkans. There is not a single map of Anatolia in the entire book. Why would anyone publish a book in English for a western audience on the Byzantine Empire and not include a single map of Anatolia?"
5,Wonderful duel,"I recomend everybody to purchase this film. I am admirer of these both great english actors. The movie is full of surprises that take place in a aristocratic english cottage. An amazing garden full of statues is were the movie begin. Inside the cottage there is a world of fantasy with puppets moving everywhere, that seem watch impassive the duel between the two only characters of the film. I do not miss any other actor in the movie, they both are enough. Only great actors as them can get it. John Addison's score is as elegant and playful as the film requires."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A fine showcase of actors at the top of their games and a clever mystery, Sleuth is a little long but a fantastically enjoyable movie: rent it!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is a great movie - I have it on VHS and I saw it on Broadway. The DVD version is shovelware! No bonus material at all. No subtitles - no alternate languages - no bios - nothing! It is listed as the widescreen version, but it is presented in standard format with the picture and credits running off the side of the screen. To add insult to injury, you have to turn the disc over midway though the movie. Wait for somebody to bring out a better pressing."
4,"great film, ok DVD","The film is brilliant -- sets, acting, script are all superb. It's interesting, intelligent, visually beautiful, and creates genuine tension. How wonderful -- a thriller without gore!The DVD is done on the cheap. No bonus materials. The opening credits -- despite this being a 'widescreen' edition -- run off the sides of the screen. The 'matting' is uneven: the black strip below the picture on the screen is thicker on the left side than on the right. And, oddly (because it's over 2 hours long?), you have to turn the DVD over midway through.Glad this wonderful title is available, but a big slap on the wrist to the cheap producer and the sloppy engineer."
5,Sleuth the movie,"Sleuth is a 2 person movie with Sir Lawrence Olivier, and Michael Caine that treats the viewer to a twisting story of ingrigue and humor and suspense, a cat n mouse drama that is well worth owning"
3,"Nice stand, poor packaging for mailing","I like this product, but received it in it's original thin cardboard box. It had some wrapping around the stand inside the box, but the box itself was wrapped with gobs of tape instead of put inside of a corrugated cardboard shipping box. The box was ripped and damaged, but the stand was OK."
2,Heavy Duty Appliance Rollers,Rolled out from under appliance when attempting to move appliance creating potentially hazardous situation. Would not recommend this product.
2,Dolly with swivel wheels are better,"I am a bit peeved because I think I got used ones, as they had scratches on them out of the box. That said, these wheels work OKAY, not too great. Had trouble placing washer / drier legs on them as they slide off unless they are placed right in the middle of the squares. The other issue is the wheels don't swivel, so you can basically just go straight with them, which almost never happens when you are moving appliances. If you have to turn at an angle with the appliance on these wheels, good luck. I would pay a bit more to buy a dolly with swiveling wheels next time."
5,Perfect,"Just exactly what we were looking for, the fact that this item can be moved to size I am 100% pleased. This got the job done"
1,A KENNY G WANNA B ...,"I thought I might be finding a low priced bargain here, but to much alto and not enough tenor here for me ...This CD seems to be a Kenny G knock off ... And while I'm not a great fan of alto, Kenny G does have a way with it that elicits some sweet and often times soothing sounds (I especially like his Christmas sounds) ... Not so with Parker's as his alto comes out a little ""tin-ny"" sounding ... If I'm allowed by Amazon let me recommend Sony's ""Sax For Lovers"" or # 32. Jazz Record's ""Jazz for When You're Alone"" if you want to strike a really jazzy soft-sax-love mood ... They're both serious ""soft jazz"" tenor sax CD's by serious tenor sax artists who will get the ""gig"" done."
5,A serious masterpiece,"The other reviews are good. Trouble right now is that the DVD is becoming unavailable. This import is spoken in English, don't worry, and subtitles can be turned off. It's the full wide screen. The end credits are cut short before the music stops, which spoils that mood, but not ""in the middle of the credits"". There's a bit of nudity with Rees.The title may mislead people into thinking it's a cheap gore film. No, it's a literate masterpiece, and based on a serious novel."
4,10 days of recording without overdubs,"This 1984 release is very interesting since they recorded all tracks in 10 days straight without any overdubs. The title track, Continental Way, Twilight Solitude are the highlights of this album. Here's the tracklist:1 Zoom2 Down Upbeat3 The Continental Way4 Road Rhythm5 Froufrou6 Home Stretch7 Night Storm8 Cookin'up9 Twilight Solitude10 Air Fantasy"
2,I didn't get any enlightenment from this book,"I really don't see what the previous reviews are raving about. Here is a summary of the ideas in this book, 1.) go the extra mile 2.) use your mastermind. And ""mastermind"" is bascially to cooperate with people. Thats all. The rest just seemed like a lot of worthless ramblings. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because at least these two ideas are worthwhile but the book isn't."
5,Perfect for listening in the car and for any lending library general or business!,"Joel Fotinos, a VP at Penguin Group, narrates this fine audiobook offering the blueprint for Napoleon Hill's wealth strategy to listeners who would understand 'cosmic habitforce', sharing wealth, and more. It's an outstanding guide to wealth-building and riches and is especially lively in audio format, perfect for listening in the car and for any lending library general or business!"
5,"WAY BACK, NAPOLEON HILL'S MESSAGE SPOKE CLEARLY TO ME AND NOW.....",I FIND MYSELF SENDING HIS BOOKS TO YOUNG PEOPLE FINDING JOBS AND CAREERS...CHALLENGING THEM IN PRESENT ECONOMY. SO MANY THANK ME FOR SHARING HISMESSAGE.
5,Top 5 books,"Get it, read it, listen to it, get into your brain and heart and start to implement the things that are there. It will change your life."
5,Did the job.,Needed to add a front license plate following my relocation to Texas. This little item solved the problem. Installation was less than five minutes.
5,It truly is BEAUTIFUL!,"Perhaps the Beautiful South's best-known collection of tunes, ""0898"" carries their signature stylings of rhythm, melody, and groove. From classics heard everywhere on the radio like ""Old Red Eyes Is Back"" to the more eclectic ""We Are Each Other,"" this album lets listeners slide in and enjoy some great music while the catchy and poignant lyrics beat a path through their brains. ""0898"" is a wonderful CD to pop in on road trips, on lazy summer afternoons, or after a long day on the job--it will soothe your frazzled nerves and let your mind wander through landscapes of vivid imagery and imagination. Check out their other work for even more entertainment and endearment...you'll be hooked! =) Simply put, this album is BEAUTIFUL!"
5,also my favourite cd,"Today I bought this cd again, since I only had it on tape, and it broke the other day. I never cease to be amazed by the genius of this album, everything feels right about, and such a richness of sounds.. it will probably never show up in official lists with ""top 100 of all time"", but it has made and will stay my number one.. its great for in the car, when exercising, at home.. everywhere, sheer bliss"
5,Excellent price and excelllent shoe!,"Stride Rite's are good shoes and these are priced so low. I don't know why and I won't ask. When I got them, they were nice (looked just like the picture) with a square toe. The size is right on, they are cushy inside, and the bottom is not slippery. My toddler likes wearing them even when he does not have too."
5,What more could you ask for?,"I bought ""Buddy Guy & Junior Wells Play the Blues abum"" when it first hit the rack.Then again about a month ago. It had the same effect as it did back then...I put it in the cd player, sat down and didn't get up until I'd heard every song on the cd.It is Buddy Guy and Junior at their very best.Rickey Noel Mitchell"
4,all round blues,"Ireally enjoy this CD. What stands out for me, is you start out in New Orleans and start traveling thru Georgia on up to St.Louis and Chicago. All kinds of blues is represented.Buddy Guy and Junior Wells really work well together."
5,Considered to be the toy bible for serious collectors,"Browse through favorite childhood toys and learn just how much they're worth now in the new twelth edition offering the latest updates in what is justifiably considered to be the toy bible for serious collectors and antique dealers -- Toys & Prices 2005. While small black and white photos and a sampling of color photos are included, the meat of Toys & Prices 2005 lie in alphabetically arranged listings organized into 23 main categories, from games and lunch boxes to space toys and more. Three price ranges reflect different condition ratings: especially valuable considering it's a medium which typically is difficult to preserve from young players."
4,Good read,This is a good book for those into magick and how to work with the Moon. Easy to follow spells
5,great reference book,"Lots of information I refer back to it often! Really like this book a lot, has become one of my favorites."
5,Great Guide,"I really love this book. I began reading it the first day I got it. I am happy I purchased the book, because this gives me a great explanation on when and when not to perform spells. This has everything I was looking for. I wish this was a larger hardback book with more illustrations of the moon's phases. I use this book in combination with other spell books. I would recommend this to all who are new to crafting. I hope to find more books similar to this."
3,Valuable reference source: good data,"The written part of this book is not terribly interesting, but the data, which occupy the bulk of its pages are on very interesting topics and appear to be very carefully put together. Their summary indices should be ignored since they seem to be derived in some ad hoc fashion rather than by factor analysis or other systematic index construction technique. I expect to be using the material in multi-level analyses on a variety of topics. It is a book to dip into again and again. Ideally, it should come with a cd-rom presenting the data in some readily searchable format. Perhaps in the next edition?"
4,good mallets for toddlers to play with,"I bought these mallets as toys for my toddlers to bang on their drum set. I reduced one star because the plastic round part of the mallet may pop off and could be a choking hazard. It can easily be fixed and I really think they're okay to give the kids as long as your watching them (or your kids have matured enough to know not to put the plastic in their mouths). Given that toddlers have a knack for breaking things and/or losing things, I think these were worth buying."
3,Meh,"For an inexpensive pair of mallets, this isn't bad. Just remember you get what you pay for. They don't really give a good sound to the instrument I bought them for and they look as though they will break with regular play."
4,Astonishing stuff,"Watching this film, your heart aches because there's so much talent on display here that never got to work together at this length on film again, and you have a sudden sense of how much richer the golden age of Hollywood musicals could have been had African-Americans been given their due .... Anyhow, like everyone else I'm wowed especially by Lena Horne and by the Nicholas Brothers dance sequence. The latter is probably the single most amazing physical achievement in dance ever - you'll see it, not believe what you just saw, and then you'll be irresistably driven to show it to other people. Which is only fair; nobody should die without having seen this!"
4,This Is Entertainment!!!,"The connecting thread to this review of African-American entertainment spanning the World Wars is the reminisces of hoofer Bill Williamson(Bill Robinson). This is just a light-hearted pretense to show the rich tapestry that was the African-American contribution to our collective culture. And what a great gathering of contributors here! Robinson, Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, the Nicholas Brothers, etc. Everybody's at the top of their game in full knowledge that the opportunity to strut their stuff in a major Hollywood production wouldn't be afforded very often. The performances are infectuously joyful betraying the pain many probably felt at being discriminated against. I approached this film initially as a sociological experience and at some point I was sucked into the fun of it all."
4,Stormy Weather - a perfect storm,"My parents used to rave about this film, about Lena Horne and the title song which became her signature tune. Finally I've caught up with it and the wait was worthwhile. This 1943 film has been beautifully restored and the soundtrack is clean as a whistle. I have never seen Fats Waller perform a whole song before let alone two. We see Cab Calloway in his prime, younger audiences catching up with him years later in ""The Blues Brothers"". The dancing by the original ""Mr Bojangles"", the Nicholas Brothers and the renowned Katherine Dunham Dance Troupe is beathtaking. Lena Horne is beautiful and her gowns accentuate her beauty. It is highly recommended but I must register a feeling of sadness seeing an all-black cast movie which was they way they had to go back then - some of the stage performers even having to wear blackface on top of their natural complexion."
4,Have you ever seen moves like this?,"As a young man watching this movie, it instilled in me a since of pride and dignity knowing the challenges of that era did not stop the greatness that is now forever preserved on dvd. I'd have to agree with the great Gregory Hines who was known for this statment: ""The best tap dance number on film...the Nicholas Brothers and the big white staircase"". These brothers stole the show for me. Get it for your library."
2,Let's be truthful,"Let's be frank: This is a terrible movie. Racial stereotypes, as one might expect from 1943, abound, and they are demeaning to say the least. The plot is so weak it barely exists. The acting is dreadful. The choreography is lousy. And the heart of the love story is between a 65 year old man and a 25 year old woman. As for Robinson's dancing, well, the Nicholas Brothers are the stars in this regard. And what exactly were Cab Calloway's talents? There is a positive side to the movie: It is Lena Horne. She's a delight, and there are three standard songs in this film. Horne deserved better, and in time her great talents would be recognized. Stormy Weather should be seen in its historical context: Blacks were needed in the war effort, and this was a very rare nod to some of their entertainers by a major studio."
4,Stormy Weather - a festival of black music,"This film was a showcase for black song-and-dance entertainers from the first half of the 20th century. The plot, such as it was, was thin and simply involved a romance between Lena Horne and Bill `Bojangles' Robinson. Released by 20th Century Fox in 1943, it was in black-and-white. We also had Thomas `Fats' Waller singing and playing his own `Ain't misbehavin'', Cab Calloway with his orchestra doing his frenetic thing with `Geechy Joe' and `Rhythm cocktail', some acrobatic dancing from the Nicholas Brothers, and a full supporting cast of other singers and dancers. Dooley Wilson also appeared but he wasn't given anything to sing or play. The high spot of the film was Lena Horne's singing of the title track by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler, who also had a hand in the screenplay. An enjoyable 80 min of entertainment."
3,Classic performances don't add up to a great film.,"Lena Horne, Bill Robinson, Cab Calloway, Fats Waller and the Nicholas Brothers - all great performers. Actually, Bill Robinson may have been a little past his best - in the final number, it feels as though he's just warming up, and then he's finished. I'm not saying that he's bad, but based on his reputation, I'd hoped for a little more. But then any performer would have been overshadowed by the Nicholas Brothers' dancing: an incredible mixture of energy and acrobatics - if I saw it in a film today, I'd assume that there'd been some digital manipulation.However, these great performances are stitched together with a dull plot. We're not given characters we can care about, and the romance is perfunctory - as though the actors aren't even trying to be convincing. Lots of classic moments, but it all adds up to a good film, not a great one."
4,Classic Jams Included,I saw this on Netflix before buying it for my Dad. He plays the trumpet and loves jazz and standards. This film has some great scenes in it and is very upbeat.
5,A must see,"How could you not love this movie? It has Lena Horne, and Cab Calloway just to name a few amazing artists. The music numbers blend seamlessly with the story line. This is a star studded cast of anyone that was anyone back in the day. Incredible, I still love it to this day. I have seen it more times than I can count. It is neat to see all of my favorite people back when they were young. Way cool."
5,Good Entertainment!,This is another one of those old movies that I had to watch more than once to appreciate. This is largely because of the singing and dancing in the film. At times it was too much and at times it was awesome. Before watching this film I'd never seen Cab Calloway perform or watched a whole film with Lena Horne in it. Both entertainers did a great job. If you're interested in classy entertainment from early black actors this is the film to watch.
4,musicals,"To say it was made in the forties, I think that it is an excelent musical, and one of the better ones even if the story line is medioca. the music and thesongs are terrific. G.Jackson."
3,Excellent Dancing,"This Movie starts out very good, then kinda loses track. The dance scenes are excellent and has a very cool Zoot Suit scene at the end. Fats waller and Bojangles do what they do best and its makes for some very nice watching. Swing Dancers will want to add this to the collection"
3,An uneven classic,"Remembering this as a true period piece in film, ""Stormy Weather"", nonetheless is both delightful and difficult to view. It's standard black stereotyping does nothing to enhance a miserable plot and bad acting. Yet, performances by Fats Waller, Cab Calloway, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson and the impressive Nicholas brothers are wonderful. Lena Horne, sings her signature piece, ""Stormy Weather"", of course. If one can get past the dialogue, there is much merit in the film."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD because I missed seeing it at a local theatre that features old films, but I was disappointed in that the story wasn't good or interesting. However, I wanted to see the dancers, the Step Brothers - I think they were called, where they did that fantastic dance down the stairs. That was unbelievable! Also wanted to see beautiful Lena Horne, but disappointed that they didn't have her in beautiful gowns. So, other than the Step Brothers dancing, I was bored."
1,Not as I had hoped for,"Living on the Gulf Coast of Texas, our winters are seldom cold - it rarely gets to 30 degrees. The description did not mention that these were heavy and designed for really cold weather. I now have useless sleepwear."
3,Hard to actually learn the language,"The first CD teaches vocabulary. After having fun with this, I popped in the second CD. I found that the second CD is all in Italian and that the vocabulary words I learned from the first CD were not nearly enough for me to understand the full Italian sentences spoken on the second CD. There is nothing here -- on any of the CDs -- to really teach Italian sentences.It's a struggle to learn anything but vocabulary from this. Caveat emptor."
2,Not practical for actually speaking Italian,"I received this item as a gift to prepare for my vacation in Italy. This CD is good for a young child who just wants to learn very, very basic words and phrases. You learn a handful of phrases you might need but that is about it. And the other customer was correct, the 2nd CD in Talk Now is completely italian and contains words and complete sentences that were never even introduced in the first CD. If you want to have your 7 yr old child impress his/her grandparents by knowing how to count in Italian or know how to say colors in Italian, this is great. However if you want to learn to actually somewhat converse in Italian, skip this CD."
1,Instant Aversion,"Bought version 2.0 of this at a local bricks & mortar retailer. I couldn't get the software on disc 1 to work. Exchanged the disc - tried it on a few different computers but no luck, so I'm shopping for something else now."
2,Shouldn't of been made!,"Forgive me for saying this but this C.D. is pretty bad.I thought the music was pretty good in the game, but I guess some music wasn't meant for remixes. I don't really think anyone should buy this C.D. if they really like Parisite Eve music. so do yourself a favor and buy the real untainted soundtrack to this game, and not waste your money like I did."
2,Fish Hooks!!!?,"Fish Hooks!!!?A portly George C. Scott reprises his role from the 1970 classic Patton. Too bad this movie is awful. Briefly stated, this is a sequel that should not have been made. The flimsy dialog, poor editing, and cumbersome made-for-television format do no justice to Francis Ford Coppola's original epic. Be sure to note the expanding belt-line... only a few months in movie-time, but Scott looked like he'd been hanging out with Marlon Brando for the 16 years between films."
1,Horrible Picture Quality,"I would give the rating of the movie ***stars, but the picture quality of the DVD is dismal. It is almost not watchable. The picture is blurry, like watching an old TV broadcast with a rabbit ear antenna."
2,There's a reason this was only on TV,"The original Patton motion picture is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies. George C. Scott is a genius and one of my favorite actors. I was happy to find this movie on Amazon on Demand, but was disappointed with the movie itself.-Looks like a low-budget made for TV movie which it is.-Casting was poor. Outside of George C. Scott these were a bunch of B or C actors. Richard Dysart as Eisenhower was particularly bad.-As noted in many other reviews, the video quality was poor.-Way too long and way too depressing.I was hoping this movie would cover more of the postwar Patton and less of George C. Scott lying in a hospital bed. If they cut off the last third of the movie, it might be four stars.I recommend you pass on this movie, at the very least stop watching after the accident. He suffers paralyzed in a hospital bed and dies. There is nothing useful after that point and there is a LOT of overacting."
2,Great Story-Bad Reproduction,"Good sequal to ""Patton"". Worthy addition to the original. The quality of the dvd however leaves alot to be desired. My copy looks like a copy made from a VHS tape. But, for 1 cent & shipping I guess I can't complain."
3,This release-- very poor transfer to DVD,"Just popped this DVD in, and I'm sure I'll enjoy it as I love Patton's history and from what I can see right now, Goerge C. Scott is in the same form he was for the major theater predecessor.This release from Brentwood is indeed a very poor transfer as other reviewers mentioned before me. I notice there is what appears to be a more recent release for a slightly higher price-- perhaps it is better.In this case, at $3.99 I'm not going to complain."
3,It's a Made For TV Movie,"I just watched this DVD last night. The best thing about it is that George C. Scott is again playing General Patton. This movie was made in 1986 and Scott looks older and less energetic than he did in 1970. There is no battle action. The drama consists mostly of political and inter-personal reactions to the Generals opinions and ideas concerning the defeated Germans and the Russians, both of which were noted in the movie ""Patton."" Of historical interest, the accident that lead to his death and his hospitalization afterwards are depicted in detail."
4,The Last Days of Patton,"I purchased the streaming version of this TV Movie. Historally, it's pretty accurate as TV Movies go. The problem is that the streaming from Amazon Instant Video is pretty choppy. There's a studder about every two minutes or so that makes it pretty distracting. Amazon needs to work on the video of this movie. But for $3.95, what can one expect."
3,THE LIFE HISTORY OF GENERAL PATTON TO HIS ENDING !!!,"THIS MOVIE WAS THE SEQUEL TO PART I: GENERAL GEORGE S. PATTON : TANK COMMANDER....THIS WAS PART DOCUMENTARY AS WELL AS BEING A MOVIE....THIS DID NOT SHOW MUCH ""BLOOD AND GUTS"" AS HIS FIRST MOVIE ....."
2,The Last Days of Patton,"I found this movie very disappointing. I guess after Patton anything else would be hard to compare. That said, I had high hopes given the fact that I enjoyed the original so much. I did not even get half way through it before becoming bored with the plot. Stick with the original, you will not be sorry."
4,Great film but the historical details are open to interpretation,"History & military enthusiasts will enjoy this film. However, the recreation of Patton's car ""accident"" does not match up with the facts known about the actual events and ""accident"" scene. Recent evidence and witness testimony suggests the car crash was a pre-meditated act to assassinate Patton and that a major cover-up of the potential crime scene occurred after the event. The truth behind Patton's demise remains to be fully told and this film leaves out some of those facts. Patton's legacy deserves better."
4,Sad but true,"George C. Scott reprises his role as Patton in the 2nd part of the movie ""Patton"" It picks up where the movie left off, with the end of WWII to the tragic car accident that left Patton paralyzed. Eva Marie Saint climbs aboard as Mrs. Patton. Beautifully done!"
4,"In times of peace, prepare for War","Ladislas Farago wrote the definitive biography of General George S. Patton back in the 70's.... which was the book upon which the film with George C. Scott was based. Even though Patton is a little older, fatter and wiser in this film, it still coveys the historical accuracy of the general's final days. Scott's portrayal of Patton has lost none of its personality and deserves its rightful place as volume two of the Patton story."
3,I love patton but.,I love Patton the original but this spin off /sequel i think destroys what the first movie portrayed and I would never watch this one again. Its insulting.
5,Great sequel!,"If you liked Patton, then you will need to get this DVD to show how his remarkable life ended. A great addition to your WWII collection."
3,NICE FOLLOW UP TO AN ICONIC MOVIE,"Nice follow up movie, but the DVD quality was very poor. Nobody played General Patton like George C. Scott, I can watch it and watch it - timeless!"
3,"Slightly disappointed after Gary's big ""To-Do"" About it","I checked this book out after hearing Gary make a big stink about it on one of his Radio broadcasts. I was going to reactivate my enzyme systems, overcome all kinds of my ailments using this book! He went on and on at how great this book was, and how it was many years in the making.Well, it's got some decent recipes, but it really doesn't go into very in-depth informaiton about juicing itself. It's mainly a recipe book, many of which are taken from the Juiceman's book, which were taken from Dr. Norman Walker's books. These recipes have been around for 50+ years, and there's nothing new or revolutionary about this book. Perhaps if I didn't hear the book as hyped up as it was, would I think otherwise. I put this book down with gaining little or no valuable information from its content."
1,A disappointment!,"The title is misleading. There is no joy, no discussion, no valuable information. It's just a list of juicing recipes."
2,I guess this could be an appropriate title...,"While there are juicing recipes in here there are a lot of recipes that are more appropriate for blender or food processor. As part of my resolution this year I bought a juicer but many recipes make very large quantities- Like 3 quarts or even a gallon! Um, if I need to feed juice to that many people I doubt I'd ever use my juicer and would instead by concentrate or the prepared stuff from the market. Not really helpful for the novice juicer."
5,"Bruce Didn't Invent Happiness, 'Just Made It Easy to Find","This tape can be the key to opening up a whole new happy life for anyone who wants it. That is exactly what it did for me when I learned the Option Method 17 years ago. On this great intro to the Option Method, Bruce DiMarsico dispells the mystique around unhappiness by exposing the notion that the experience of unhappiness is always based on what someone believes... often erroneously. Questioning the belief(or judgement or assumption) can effectively vaporize the unhappy conclussion. Hearing one of Bruce's original lectures on Option rekindles the fire in me to spread the word to other happiness-seekers. Do yourself a favor... get this tape and let yourself out of YOUR prison of unhappiness. If I can do it, anyone can!"
4,Option method is great but its not whole new idea,"Option method is truly a way of putting thought into feelings. I think it basically encourages to think before we commit to certain idea, and ideas lead to beliefs, beliefs lead to feelings and emotions. Option method is a way to pause, think and take a rational decision, which would most possibly lead to better emotions and therefore happier life.Bruce di marsico says that happiness is an option, and we have to choose it, by thinking through what lead to unhappiness. There are however, certain things which we have to feel unhappy, and are un avoidable.This is similar to cognitive therapy, where mood disorders, depressions, anxiety are treated by changing our feelings by rational and positive thinking. I would recommend Mind over mood, if you like this video by bruce di marsico.This is just my opinion, and I like any comments or suggestions, because I am still learning."
5,A Truly Helpful Way To Be Happier Now!,"This timeless tape is filled with humor, wisdom and wonderful liberating questions to help you get to the real cause of your emotional pain and self-limitation. I had the life-changing privilege of studying with this inspiring teacher in the early 1970's, followed by the joy of teaching others how to change their unhappy belief systems for over 30 years. I cannot imagine what my life would be like had I not had that opportunity, so I am especially glad that everyone can now hear these simple, powerful ideas from the man who originated the Option Method, himself, Bruce Di Marsico."
4,Mixed Feelings,"Well this cd had some dissapointments, One was the tacky Techno songs. Yes I know this cd was arranged this way, but some just go too far with it. The ""Shop"" song though is a good take on it. Changing it into a neat jazzy song. Last Battle, and Zeldas Theme arn't too bad either. Anyway to make a long story short, If you arn't a big fan of techno (like myself), but want to own this, go ahead. Just a warning you might be dissapointed."
2,It Will Ruin Your Veiwing Enjoyment,"This system is horrid. Not only have I had problems with it skipping, pausing, and completely freezing, but so has a friend of mine with the same system. I dont recomend this product to anyone unless you dont mind a great movie skipping, pausing out for a second or so, or completely freezing up on you. I personally find it very frustrating. The sound is decent for the little money, but this skipping, pausing, and freezing is enough to make you want to throw your new machine in the trash."
1,i need help,"i bought the sts13-s venturer and it will not play my cds, nor dvds the cd loads put does not play, it freezes the disc doesn't spin at all, i cannot get anything on my tv at all, is there anyone that can help me out here, could it be the head on it, i hope not it is fresh out of the box. please if someone can help iwould really appreciate it.thankspat"
3,Good Enough,"This Everglades story is an interesting ecological mystery, but it's a bit too repetitive. (By now if you've read all my reviews you'll know it's one of my pet peeves.) Searching for a missing alligator the entire story is a bit too much, hm? Well, overall it's a good ecological mystery, but only if you're bored should you make the drastic decision to read it."
4,could've been better,I thoguht this book was OK but could've been better. It has an exiting plot wiht a hunter trying to hunt the gator[dajun] but the ending is so typical. They end up finding...oops I shouldn't give away the story...but the book's ending is not as fun as it could've been. But if you love animals and a good mystery you should definitly read this book.
3,pretty interesting,"I don't think the ending ended well. I didn't like it that so many had to leave. Alison, 4th Grader - The story could have been shorter and with a bit better text, but it was pretty interesting. Dave, 4th Grader"
1,"No fun, no action, no good","I'm a 10 yead old boy who loves to read! but I totally hate this book. It was a summer reading assignament from school (4th grade). Nothing happens in 148 pages of boaring, repetitive and monotonus writing.They say things over and over again. This book is lable as an Eco mistery, but it seams to me like an encyclopedia type of reading. To much unnecesary information.I would not recomend this book at all."
5,I LOVED THE MISSING GATOR OF GUMBO LIMBO,FOR THREE NIGHTS BEFORE I WENT TO BED MY MOM READ THE BOOK TO ME. AT THE END I WANTED TO HEAR MORE. DONNA
2,OK,"I read this book in my class and it took me forever to finish it. I am a big reader but I just couldn't get into the book. I think it should have been more exciting. In my opinion, it seemed as if the author kept repeating the same information."
5,A must read for fans,"I just finished reading this wonderful book about the Northern European myths that Tolkien borrowed and reshaped to make the lands, people, and languages of Middle-earth come alive. For the price and content, this is a great value. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Tolkien's fiction!"""
2,Mediocre mythic study of Tolkien,"Juggles large numbers of mythic references with some skill but not full confidence or accuracy, and doesn't really have a lot of insight. The book is also burdened with a Hildebrandt cover. I recommend David Colbert's ""The Magical Worlds of The Lord of the Ring"" for juvenile readers, or Anne C. Petty's ""Tolkien in the Land of Heroes"" for adults."
2,"Shoddy piece of work, notable only for the presence of Gwynne","Anne Gwynne was one of those Hollywood supporting players who appeared in a lot of movies, but was seldom recognized. She normally ended up playing romantic leads in B-movies - often a weak person, but with a feisty streak in her that made her too hot to handle for her insipid male co-stars. Made later on in her career, TEENAGE MONSTER has very little to recommend it, except as a poor imitation of I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN. Gwynne tries her best as a parent, but has little to work with."
4,Best Teenage Monster EVER!,I love:--The 1950s--Movies that are so bad that they're good--Teenage monsters that are 14 years older than their mothers--Boston Cream PieI didn't have any Boston Cream Pie during the movie so I took away one star--otherwise I have to say it's one of the best Teenage Monster films EVER!
5,Awesome music from germany,"This is the first of 5 albums from the band Dune. Some of theirother titles include remakes of ""Nothing compares to you""and ""Who wants to live forever"""
1,Not for us,"I have never seen the British version, but we liked the American ""Queer as Folk"". It was funny and real. Series 2 is a disappointment, the action seems contrived, and so do the characters. We couldn't believe a minute of it. If you are a fan of the American version you will probably have to have lowered expectations to enjoy this."
3,A good series.,"I saw the Showtime series first, and then ordered these. I would suppose that, if you watch them in reverse, you might enjoy this series a little more. This was the original that kicked-off the more risque series on Showtime and I didn't enjoy it as much. Still, overall a great series, and ground-breaking in its own right."
4,Either Amazon or Windsor messed up. Only received 1!,"I received only 1 canvas, even though it says it's a pack of 6. The 1 canvas I did get was great and I already painted on it. I had to chat w/ customer service and they advised they would resend me the order 1 day shipping, but then I looked at the delivery estimate and I won't get it until 9/18/12- 10/5/12, which is pointless. I just read all the other reviews and this seems to be a common occurrence."
5,11 x 14 Windsor Newton canvas pack,The item came in record time and in perfect condition. This was the second time that I have ordered this item and I will reorder it again in the future possibly in a different size.
1,"STILL only sending 1 instead of 6 pack, 2 year problem","I realize that this ""should"" be a review about the quality of the product, BUT for almost 2 YEARS people have been commenting that they received one canvas instead of a pack of six. Sorry, but that is simply unacceptable. I'm very disappointed in Amazon for letting it go on this long. I'm sorry that the manufacturer won't have people purchasing their item, but there is no excuse for a problem to continue for nearly 2 years and not be resolved."
1,Missing The Other Five,"Like one of the other reviewers, I ordered this as a pack of six. However, it arrived and it was a single canvas in a giant box. What happened to the other five? When I contacted Amazon, it says that they're out of stock for these. Why is this happening to more than one person? Just be sure to check your box. The canvas was nice and actually what I wanted but I didn't want to pay for six and get one..."
3,Canvas,Hmmm. I felt the price was good the product is good. You get what you pay for and you get good canvas.
4,Great price for stretched canvas for a girls' party,"I was having a painting party for my daughter's 12th birthday party and wanted the kids to have something nice to take home with them, but the cost of canvases can really add up!! I found these canvases for a great price and they were perfect for the purpose for which they were used. I'm not an artist myself, so I don't know much about the quality of canvases, but these definitely met our needs and the girls had a ball!"
2,Received just one canvas,The package contained just one stretched canvas and not 6 as the description claims. I had to return this order as Amazon cannot replace it for some reasons.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,This product claims to be six canvases but in fact they only send one. IT IS A RIPOFF!! DON'T BUY.
3,So-so,"After thoroughly enjoying Gordon Wenham's commentary on Genesis, also part of the Word Biblical Commentary series, I had great expectations of John Durham's commentary on Exodus. However, I was disappointed. Durham has almost no discussion of the historical background of the story and little on the literary structures within the text. He focuses almost entirely on his translation of the text and, frankly, as a Hebrew reader and speaker I find his translation extremely inelegant.Still, the commentary provides some interesting insights and excellent bibliographic material."
1,do not use in the wind,"I have had at least four of these in the past 3 years. If a gust of wind comes along, the frame bends and you have a bunch of scrap metal. The last one lasted about an hour and a half before one of the legs bent making the product unuseable."
5,Swept away to France,"If you liked Salvador's"" Chambre Avec Vue"" you will love this. If you don't know Salvador imagine a male combination of Astrud Gilberto, Blossom Dearie, and Jane Birkin. I dont know of a male contender for his soft minimal jazz voice except perhaps Jo Gilberto. The song selection is all French ballads, played and sung with a quiet jazz, simple, sort of bossa nova delivery. No French marching songs, clever novelty songs, or over-the -top Piaf theatrics; strictly light, fresh, crisp and airy as a nice bottle of Chablis. Romantic music, not especially for having sex, more for sitting beside your lover and listening. During the week of the recent bombings in America I listened to this CD almost constantly. It was very reassuring that, yes, there is beauty and love in the world."
5,My ears adore.,.....smooth/propulsive/bleep/clever/dark/European/techno/Jarre/Depeche/Visage/Kraftwerk/Moroder/Gorl/Anne Clark/N-Joi/Nitzer Ebb/Skinny Puppy/historical?/Germanic/dancing/Black & White/Art Deco/Man Ray/Arts & Crafts/clean/Frank DeWulf/alien/hypnotic/erotic/invigorating/Orbital/Simian Mobile Disco/IAMX/Sneaker Pimps/disco/futuristic/dada. What more could you ask from a bit of music. This disc is destined to be a classic - at least for me. It will sit in amongst the cd's that I even now listen to on a regular basis from many different decades.Classics never age.
2,"Uh, well...","Really mediocre romantic comedy featuring a brown-haired Helen Hunt before Mad About You and As Good As It Gets, Kelly Preston before her career surge, and Andrew McCarthy on the downside of his Brat Pack run. Shows up occasionally on cable, and best left there."
2,"Great fun, but bad design, pops apart, and that's all folks!","When it's working, it's fun to watch it go up and down and around, but the battery is basically between the two pieces which are held together by a o-ring, no screw, no plastic ridge to pop it together, so basically it's really easy to pop apart, especially when turning it on and off involves twisting it, which many times makes it pop open. (The battery being sprung is pushing against the o-ring)anyhow, get a kid near it, and it's fragile setup basically ends up in two pieces in the water, and water in the motor, and days drying out... after a few times of this happening, the motor has started to turn slow (probably starting to rust inside).If the company could redeisgn this to get a positive locking to the pieces, this toy would be a home run, but as it's stands, it's really just a great idea stuck with a poor design."
4,How can we let our babies have babies?,"This story is not for the faint at heart. Once you start reading it, there is no way you can put it down. The writing was straightforward. My only wish is that the family that was written about would have been more caring about the lives of their children. How can we let our kids down? The world will never know."
1,"Poor quality, not sharp","These chisels are not sharp out of the box. My skew chisel was chipped and I see from other reviews there have been more than one chipped. As another review said, I cannot sharpen the carbide tips, so I have a new set of chisels that are not as useful as my old ones that I can sharpen. Don't waste your money on these chisels."
2,You get what you pay for.,These may have been fine except that there was a large chip in the skew chisel. And besides nothing beats quality made tools these are not. they are for those whom lack the time or the know how to sharpen their chisels. Do it right the first time so that you dont have to do it a second.
2,Great concept except....,I have the spindle gouge which was not sharp (compared to a freshly sharpened HSS tool) out of the box. And the problem is that you can't sharpen the tool with the wheel intended for HSS steel. Without investing is a new grinding wheel for sharpening this tool which costs more than the tool and I don;t plan to buy this tool is useless which is a real shame.
1,Dreadful performance,"I expected so much better from the great Andre Previn. This version of the greatest programmatic orchestral music of all time is simply terrible -- utterly uninspired and passionless, both in the solo piano and orchestral versions. The tone is muddy throughout, and I don't think it's the engineering: pianist and orchestra just seem listless in a piece that should leave listeners awed and thrilled. The pacing is all wrong. No definition in the percussion. The brasses sound bored. Listening to this is like reading Cliff Notes of War and Peace. Either the performers didn't understand this music or they didn't care. The best version remains Toscanini's with the NBC Symphony Orchestra: even with 1950s recording technology, scorchingly brilliant."
5,AMAZING,"I love this album and I love Laura Shay!! This album takes me back to 2006 when I was young and in love..this album is my soundtrack for that year! Whenever I listen to a song I get goosebumps as I'm reminded of those sweet times!! I highly recommend this not because I have so many fond memories but because it is a beautiful work of art. The lyrics, the music, it is one word which is amazing."
3,Umbrella shaft precludes getting the light close to the subject,"What seems to be woefully missing from all images of this product is the ""8 feet"" (exaggerated) of umbrella sticking out from it. Once mounted on an umbrella bracket, there's a lot of shaft to deal with. This is a huge limitation when using a speedlight as a light source. With more distance, you get much less light (inverse square law), blah blah blah. Haven't got my money's worth yet."
1,A nice way to flood the courts with rightwing fascists,"Not recommended for non-neoconservatives who believe in true justice. The author is just a dog for rightwing politics. The same neonazi neocons who complain about activist judges are themselves promoting their own set in the process. If you believe in losing the Constitution and turning this country into a theocratic dictatorship, then buy this book and join the losers."
1,Endorsed by Edwin Meese and George W. Bush,"As to be expected of a book endorsed by Edwin Meese and George Bush, this book talks about how to permit right wing fascism by undermining the balance of power afforded by the Judicial Branch. Phyllis is in her typical form, blasting judges for such things as ending segregation and protecting human rights. Like another reviewer said, past the title there is nothing new. If you want to see where people like Reverend Pat Mahoney, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell get their ideas of how to destroy this country by breaking down the balance of power so that they can build a murderous Theocracy, this book is for you."
1,Not convincing and overly political,"I knew mrs Schlafly's ideas from reading her columns at townhall, and this book therefore taught me nothing new. If you read the book description that is displayed above, there is no more need to buy this book.Her point: modern judges are doing a bad job because the interpret the constitution instead of listening to the majority."
1,This book is more off balanced more than our Judicial System,"You can't throw out the baby with the bathwater! If you feel that our Judicial system is flawed because it is not being held accountable - wouldn't that be an argument for more checks and balances not less?So then what is this really about? I believe that the author is afraid of social evolution (as evidenced by her other books.) Although I don't understand why she is - without it she couldn't be an author, lawer, columnist, AND be the mother of six. Anyways, she would like to replace our judges with know it alls like herself. She does a good job of presenting the facts that back up her agenda, but she misses any evidence of how the system that she proposes would be doomed to fail. After all, history shows us the ugly death of all previous Theocracies. If you are afraid of moving forward, this book is for you. If not save your money for a book with more balance."
3,Our Robed Masters.,"Well, this is the best time to review this book as it's now clear that, at least for the next four years, we will have fewer ""supremacists"", or judicial lawmakers, writing our laws rather than interpreting them. Only through the courts has the left been able to succeed in pushing through its cultural agenda. Schlafly reviews a suprising number of cases in this book to illustrate the way in which judges have been become more powerful forgers of government than the legistlators that we actually elect. Her case is strong and the book is very readable; however, I would recommend waiting until the paperback comes out as the book is far too short to be worth full price. It was a helpful primer though for those of us with only fading memories of Marbury v. Madison and ex parte McCardle."
1,excellent movie - poor quality,this movie with its magnificant cast and its thrilling story could be recommended like all films made by master-director Damiani - but I suffered when watching the story because they sent me a copy with a rather poor image-quality (like a view through strong softening lenses)...a pity..
3,Pumpkin Pie warning,"I made the pumpkin pie recipe just by following the directions to the letter and--what a disaster. It said to bake the pie on the floor of my oven. This caused the pie to get done way too quickly, the crust started to brown too much before the custard was done, and the butter from the crust oozed onto the oven floor. The pie was overdone and the bottom crust burned black. I had bought The Cake Bible and Christmas Cookies and loved using both books with fine results, but this recipe was a mess. Just can't understand what happened. I've had a lot of baking experience (45 years or so), and I don't usually fail. Probably the other recipes are great from other readers' comments, but be careful with this one."
3,A newspaper or cookbook?,"Good content, lousy lay out. This reads more like a newspaper than a cookbook. A tart for example, would have you flipping through various parts of the book to get the directions for the crust and the filling. Takes a lot of time to flip back and forth. Probably not too bad for those that like to research and flip back and forth. I gave it a three because the content is rock solid. But the lack of photos and the flipping through several sections of the book deducts two stars."
5,Great for the Serious Pie/Pastry Baker,"I bought this book because I loved Rose's Bread Bible and I wanted to make really good pies and pastries. Before using this book I had not had a lot of experience making pies, I had made a couple apple pies and pumpkin pies, but they were all kind of blah. Not anymore!! Even with my little experience Rose transformed me into an awesome pie baker!! After I made my first pie from the Pie Bible, people were telling me it was the best pie they had ever had in their life! Now, I have to warn you, her pies do take a while to make. In many cases it's an all day (or multiple days) affair. However, I promise you, if you diligently follow her instructions, the results will be worth it!"
5,The perfect companion to The Cake Bible,"Just when I thought that The Cake Bible was the ultimate culinary experience, Rose Levy Beranbaum strikes again. I just bought a copy for my mother who taught me to love and bake my own pies from scratch. She lays it all out for you, step by step, and never leaves you hanging. Not only are there wonderful decadent recipies for pies of all kinds, but also for savory breads as well. How do I feel about this book? To paraphase a famous saying -- you can have my Pastry Bible when you pry it from my cold dead fingers!"
4,Easy to follow recipe,Last week I recive the Pie and Pastry Bible and I've already try out three recipes with good result. The children absolutly loves the Peanutbutter mousse pie and me and my husband hacve the pear and ginger cake as a new favourite.
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I've had this book for over a year and I must say that as time goes by, I am less and less impressed with this book. I have no problem following instructions yet it took me three tries to get some of these recipes to turn out. I never got her sweet nut crust to work. I used the recipe from ""In the Sweet Kitchen"" instead and the crust came out perfect.And some of the recipes are not nearly as imressive as they look. The only recipe that I've made that received any ""wows"" from my guests was the tiramisu tart, and that wasn't until the third time I made it when I made significant changes to the recipe. A few of the recipes were huge disappointments.I would highly recommend ""In the Sweet Kitchen"" or the Cindy Mushet book instead."
5,Be an Instant Pastry Chef!!,"I have used this book on several special occassions. I don't even have to do a trial run before I present the final dessert, because I am confident that every recipe in this book will turn out just as promised. Easy to follow instructions, and ingredients that you find at your local grocery store---what could be better! By using Rose's recipe book, I have become the automatic dessert maker in my family....especially when it comes to pies."
2,Devil's in the details.,"The recipe instructions are inconsistent and ridiculously overcomplicated. ""Great"" pumpkin pie, for example. The instructions say to bake the pie directly on the oven floor. If you have a gas oven that heats from the bottom, you are getting nothing but a burnt pie (thanks for a Thanksgiving failure, Rose). Designer Apple Pie is nice, the trick of boiling down the apple juices is slick. But the cream cheese crust? I've had better results from the Joy of Cooking recipes. Her recipes are too fragile to be reproduced consistently. If you are off by a degree in the oven, or off by a minute in the timing, forget it, your pie is ruined. Other pie recipes are less sensitive. Working with her crust recipes is like walking on eggshells.I've been making pies for 20 years. I can't say the details that make Berenbaum's recipes so complicated make her pies much better than ones I've made in the past from other cookbooks. Very disappointing."
4,A mexican review,"Good recipes, easy to follow instructions but just a few pictures. I think that an author as famous as Rose Levy should spend a little more in pictures."
2,Sigh!,"I've had this book since year nought. But I have never made anything from it. Having said that I currently have cubed butter and a flour mixture in the freezer. My first stab at making pie from this tome. Obviously my rating of 2 stars does not reflect the quality of the recipes. It's reserved for the wonderful folks at Scribner. I think Ms Beranbaum might be the world's most gifted cake/pie/bread maker but she certainly needs a bit of help when it comes to picking a publisher. My 'Cake Bible' fell apart very quickly as the pages couldn't wait to detach themselves from the feeble spine. This has not happened to my pie bible coz as I said, I've never used it. The sections are not very well organized and having to refer back and forth is annoying. A couple of those built-in bookmarks (like the Gourmet cookbook) would have been so helpful. Anyway, I can go on all day but other reviewers have beaten me to it."
2,Not for the novice,"After reading just a couple of her receipies, I discovered this book is not for the faint at heart when it comes to baking. Although when I watched her on an early morning program, I gathered there was a more balanced experience of receipies. Her citation of types of flour is simply more information that I was interesting in having and boardered on what one might call flour snobbery. So far, the only method I have regularly incorporated in my pastry baking is her reference to chilling. So as all is not down the pastry funnel, I will pick and choose a few more receipies now and then to try."
2,bad recipes--buyer beware,"This book has some good baking TIPS, but many of the recipes simply do not work. I'm a fairly experienced baker and don't seem to have this kind of trouble with other books."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on the Rose Levy Beranbaum Pie and Cake Bibles. She unnecessarily complicates the recipes, and the instructions are not easy to understand. After hours of pains taking effort, the results are quite often NOT GOOD at all. I'm a very experienced cook, and have been disappointed each time I ventured into one of her lengthy and obtuse culinary ordeals."
5,Real Treasure,"The book is a real treasure to any baker: all the details, all the step-by-step, it gives confidence and explains the secrets of pastry. I just love it!"
1,Not good,I was disappointed in this book--too European for my taste. I expected more from her. I'll give it to Goodwill or such.
2,"cute, but FLIMSY","we ordered these as part of a Halloween costume.It is very very flimsy and is literally falling apart after only a few minutes out of the box...While it is ""light and safe"" as per another reviewer's comment, kids will want to mimic sword fighting. With these, they seem to break just by lightly swinging them around."
3,"Ninja Sword - 24"" Size Accessory","This is a ""party"" or ""costume"" quality item. The sword blade is hollow and thus very susceptible to folding. My son is going to use these as a decoration on his Halloween costume. As soon as I unpackaged them, I could see how flimsy they were, so he is not allowed to play with them until after Halloween, at which time I am sure they will last for a few days."
4,"Interesting, sometimes thought provoking","This disc consists of four different stories. While only two of them really deal with robots and are the thought provoking stories, the other two are quite watchable. They're all well written and performed. It's a short disc, so you don't get a lot of bang for your buck, but it's worth seeing if you're interested in the social aspects of artificial life."
2,No support for Windows XP,The software for this unit does not support Windows XP. The unit is not of much use without being able to interface with the computer.
5,Works Great and makes Great Coffee!,This is the best coffee maker we've ever had. The coffee stays hot most of the day and doesn't get bitter. Everything works as described and we've had no problems at all.
1,Defective Machine - Don't buy!,"I was looking for a coffee machine with a thermal caraffe. At first, the cofee was great. Then a couple of weeks later, coffee started to pour directly out of the machine onto the floor! I thought maybe I had a bad machine, so I took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one. A month later, same problem! The coffee pours around the caraffe, not into it. I burned myself trying to clean it up, and it stained my nice kitchen floors. I'm taking it back for a different brand coffee maker, I won't be fooled three times!"
2,And another floor full of coffee...,"This is the only 12-cup thermal carafe coffee maker I've been able to find, and it's at a decent price. So what's the problem? The machine is supremely finicky about: 1) placement of the filter holder in the basket; 2) closing the swinging basket against the main unit; and 3) placement of the carafe beneath the basket. It's surprisingly easy to get any of those three just slightly wrong, and easy to miss that they aren't quite square. And the result if ANY of the three ""moving parts"" is even minutely ""off"" is coffee all over your counter and floor. We've owned the machine for seven or eight months, and manage to wash the floor with Starbucks at least once a month - and we're forewarned and pretty careful! Too bad - it makes good coffee but who wants to slurp it off the tile?"
3,But the BEEPS... the BEEPS!,"This machine has worked fine for years and makes great coffee...Bad side is that if you do not seat the filter basket perfectly or if a ground or two clogs up the little hole, coffee runs out all over the floor.And the most irritating thing is the beeps when the machine finishes. They are loud enough to wake the house and there is no way to shut them off.C'mon Cuisinart. give the consumer some control."
5,A pail of oysters. [Hardcover] Vern. SNEIDER,"This is a fictional story, but the tale might as well be real to a Taiwanese. The story starts in near Lukang when KMT soldiers steal the god from a family and he is sent to bring it back. Much of the story focuses around an American newsman stationed in Taipei and how he learns Nationalist Taiwan is not what it seems. The true story behind the fiction is that Sneider met Ed Paine, an eye witness to the 228 massacre and Paine hooked Sneider up with his interpreter. The history is fuzzy, the places are not where they should be, but the story is more an allegory of 50's Taipei with the dreaded race track and deaths. This book is now considered rare following years of KMT student spies stealing it from libraries. --not my review, but Maowang from Forumosa"
3,The Only Game in Town,"This book is worthwhile simply because it is the only one out on the subject. But there are few revelations, it merely conslidates information that has appeared in articles and interviews over the years. The interviews are rewarding, but should have been edited for coherence and attribution. The writing is trite, hackneyed, and the author too frequently inserts himself and his very biased opinions into the story. And a number of factual blunders calls all the apparent research into question. Disappointing, sometimes apalling, but the only game in town."
3,The best part is the one-on-one interviews,"I am a fairly recent (since 1989) fan of RT, and I've always wanted to know more about him as a person and artist. The interviews are good, especially the ones with bandmates and his current wife and ex-wife, however the politics and album details really bog down the reader. I appeciate context, but sometimes it was too much. Still, the book was fascinating in parts and I recommend it for fans."
3,Thompson as Careerist,"Humphries concentrates on the history of Thompson's recording career. That involves him in a double reduction: life and work are largely reduced to career, and career is largely reduced to recording career. The result is woefully narrow; the book could have been called GENIUS AS MARGINALITY: PROBLEMS IN THE MARKETING OF RICHARD THOMPSON. To make matters worse, Humphries has a weak grasp of the difference between achievement and reception: the reader who wants to know which albums to buy will find that she is only told which ones have been well-received.(Clive Gregson: ""I don't believe that Richard has ever really been that bothered about making records. It's not the real thing for him."")Yet there are interesting quotes here, both from the articulate Thompson and from his perceptive wives, friends, colleagues, and critics. Their voices made the book a pleasure to read."
5,A+,"Love, love, love it!!!! Would buy more CDs by Matthew West any time. Need 8 more words.....love, love, love it!"
4,history cd,"Good music, good price (cheaper than buying at the store) and arrived within a few days! My whole family likes it!"
3,Good Music,"I am not a fan of contemporary Christian family friendly happy suburban American music, but this CD has some catchy songs.One Saturday afternoon my wife kept saying, ""Next thing you know.."" I asked her what that was about and then got the CD for her. She really enjoys the music.The guitar parts are extremely uncomplicated, and even a beginning guitar student can play along with some of the tunes."
5,relaxing and uplifting,"I'm a massage therapist and have lots of CD's to relax during massage and this is one of my favorites. I had the cassette and finally, many years later found this CD on Amazon and am so excited to listen to my good friend Rainforest Magic again."
5,Amazingly ... amazing.,"When i read this book for a class project i was amazed with it when i realized it was written in 1962. I read it several times as it is not the most easy of reading , but once i did so i thought it was maybe written in the eighties with a backward-looking viewpoint. When i learned the actual date of publishing... i was stupified. Must read for any of Bucky's fans."
1,Light Speed Super Pack,"Light Speed Biology: Super Pack - This will be the best buy for extremely cheaper price, instead of buying 5 separate dvds and spending $3 for each package."
2,Not 8 just 4!,They are good but it's not a set of 8 just 4! So I was dissapointed because wanted to use all 8 and because of the price (twice more expensive that it seemed).
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!,"This thing doesn't work at all - right out of the box! Says to set to low temp for several minutes to begin; 10 min later, not even warm.Description should indicate only way to get steam - for a second or two - is to mash the flimsy button on top, but then wait minute or two to get more. NO constant steam.Water reservoir would not detach to fill.Piece of cheap, worthless junk!"
5,This CD is really nice to listen to and it soothes the soul!,I listened to the CD one time with my mom and then I couldn't stop listening to it. My favorite song is Friendness!!
5,The Santanic Mill,"The Satanic Mill by Otfried Preussler is a great book to read. It is about a begger boy called Krabat who gets called to a mill in a dream. The mill is also a Black School. He met a female singer, and they both fell in love. Krabat wanted to leave the mill, but to do that the Singer (the book did not give her name) had to pick him out while he and all the other miller's men were in the form of ravens.This book is very creepy, mysrerious, and unpredictable which, I think, is great. There are several things to focus on, so it doesn't get boring. It's very nervewracking, too. All in all, it is one of the best books I have ever read. I give it a five-star rating."
5,The German historical experience with the Nazis told as a folk tale,"Ottfried Preussler, a German WW II veteran, wrote about his book: My Krabat tells [...] my personal story, the story of my generation and the story of all young people who get in touch with power and its temptations and who become entangled.""The story is based on an old wendish (west slavic) tale of which it takes over only a small part but is also a parable on totalitarian systems, how they are run by means of force and seduction and how the individuals can get away.It is interesting to see that the miller is described not only as the demonic master (which he is) but later on also as a human slave to the haunting journeyman and thus serves only as a cog in the wheel in the evil system."
5,A bit more durable than Gates,"I purchased this as a replacement for my E-powered MTB. I had a Gates belt before and it stretch out pretty quick. It didn't break, but the stretching bothered me. I installed this Goodyear belt and am able to push more power through the belt without me having to keep adjusting the tension."
3,"Lord of the Flies, but less gruelling","Two lifeships crash on an uninhabited planet, and their passengers must struggle to survive.The storyline is fairly simple adventure/survival, with lots of detail. It is somewhat like Golding's classic, but less gruelling, and with a bit more faith in human nature.First of a trilogy: 2. The Avengers of Carrig 3. The Repairmen of Cyclops"
4,A Good Survival Tale,"Brunner is rightly famous for his masterpieces Stand on Zanzibar, Shockwave Rider, and the Sheep Look Up. However, his earlier pulpish sci-fi such as Polymath is actually a pretty good survival tale on a very interesting planet. Secondly, I did not find its slight disturbing nature annoying at all, perhaps since I have managed to read Sheep Look Up and tons of Philip K. Dick. Yes, Captain Gnomes is unbelievable (but are the villains in 8/9 of fiction?) however Devia and Lex are suprisingly well rounded for characters for such a brief book that probably took Brunner a few months to write. For its one hundred and fifty four or so pages its a suprisingly good read. 4/5"
3,"crafty SEVENTIES hard boiled logicisms, no new wavism!","YOU have to pay attention within [this] one, THE simple, you dont want to think much about .

1,Disappointed,"After starting to read the first of many stories in this book. I closed it and didn't read the rest. I do not like fiction because fiction is a story made up in someone else's head. I thought these would be true stories. So if you like fiction, you will like this book. If you want true cat stories, which I prefer, this is not for you. It's my own fault being disappointed in this book merely because it is fiction. I guess it's a good book, again, if you like fiction."
4,Cheesecake Paradise,The taste was sensational and well liked by my guests. It tastes just like the Frango Mint Chocolates you would purchase at Marshal Fields. The price seems a little high.
5,Ian Richardson version of The Hound of the Baskervilles,"I highly recommend this 1983 version of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. Richardson suits the role of Holmes very well, bringing a confidence and intellectual flare to solving the case.I can't be critical of much in this movie. I enjoyed it immensely on vhs and now, again, on dvd. It's well acted, well scripted, and well produced. I think Ian Richardson is my favourite Sherlock Holmes - although I don't think he played the role as many times as other actors. Again, he brings such confidence in his ability, that as a viewer you don't really think he's not going to solve the mystery.Thumbs up. Enjoy."
2,Monotype Baskerville,"A disappointing movie: cliché-ridden directing, cardboard scenery, and acting that I feel is now dated, despite the presence of the great Ian Richardson and a young Martin Shaw. The low point IMO is Ian Cuthbertson, all too often featured in those days, for whom acting solely means raging and shouting with rrrolling eyes and a rrrolling 'r'."
1,It's a dud,"I'm a fan of Ian Richardson's from the FU series and when I saw tapes were finally available of him doing Sherlock Holmes I immediately bought them. They're AWFUL. He doesn't play Holmes well at all and the action in them is slow and stagey. Even the damn credits take too long to roll at the beginning. Mothers, tell your children not to do what I have done--SAVE YOUR MONEY and watch Jeremy Brett instead. Richardson seems like a natural for this role, but it's a disappointment."
2,warning,I made the mistake of watching this with my kids and family after church one Sunday. I had no idea there would be a rape scene! For kids stick with the Halmark version with Matt Frewer.
2,Disappointing & Dull,I could not watch this movie all the way to the end. I found the acting to be sub-par especially the American actor. I was hoping the scenery of old England would hold me through the movie but the scenery wasn't even good. The Sherlock Holmes series that aired on television was better than this DVD. Perhaps I can give my DVD as a gift to a non movie buff.
1,Not Doyle,It seems the object of the writer was to see how much he could rewrite and still keep some connection to the original story. For example Blessed and Booth's characters were changed from father-daughter to husband-wife just so Lestrade would look foolish for arresting the husband for the wife's murder. Nothing in this film works so I gave it to charity. If you want an Ian Richardson Sherlock Holmes get The Sign of Four.
4,The best film version of the story to date: 4 stars!,"Douglas Hickox is among the few directors who have understood the mystic horror of Doyle's terrifying masterpiece. Directing a brilliant Nicholas Clay, Hickox presents the audience with the best film version of the story to date: 4 stars."
4,Ian Richardson is a Perfect Holmes,"The movie was well put together, and thought out. I really liked it and they did stick fairly close to the story, but they did change a few things, and I'm not sure it was for the best. I did like it that they had the Hound and Holmes fight (that did not happen in the movie) but I didn't like it that Mrs. Lions was murdered (that didn't happen either). All in all, I'd give it four out of five stars. The acting was supurb, and I got chills just listening to the sound of the Hound . . ."
5,"Moving, enlightening, mysterious, and for the serious only","This session begins with the shimmering peal of a gong, and you enter into the somber, mysterious and intense world of 1964 John Coltrane. ""Love Supreme"", a poem of great tonal color and emotion, hailed Coltrane's religious awakening and a new period in which he embarked on a mission to uplift people. Prior to the recording of this album, Coltrane's faith was tested by the bombing of a black church in Alabama, and the death of Eric Dolphy and the tumult of the 1960s---civil rights, change, new music, new worlds. All of Coltrane's recorded work from ""Love Supreme"" forward was groundbreaking on every level. This is not for listeners who are new to Coltrane, or those who wish to hear the mainstream Coltrane of the Prestige and ""Blue Train"" period. This is for the more serious listener seeking a different and more challenging experience with sound, and with history."
5,Trane was spiritual...,"The negative reviews are from people with poor taste and poor ears. As for the review in 'trying-to-write-Ebonics' -titled ""What's the hype, dog?"" by some idiot from Garden City, MI United States - white guys fronting as black guys is very easily discerned by the knowing. Know that, playa-hatin' white boy!Now - to the album. This is very pure music that comes undiluted from the soul of a highly evolved and empathetic human being - who knows the depths and ecstasies of the human soul - and who has the genius to express every shade of his gigantic wisdom and understanding.You don't need to look up a jazz encyclopaedia and throw words around to understand this - people who do that are usually trying to show off because they lack soul.A healer plays these sounds - a medicine man. Coltrane is truly a Bodhisattva."
2,talk about navel-gazing...,"Okay already, I'm convinced you have chops! You don't have to keep trying to impress me...or each other...or yourselves...This album encapsulates the fatal flaw of jazz music, the element that is relegating it to the dustbin of history: form over substance. Nobody will care about the technical achievements of these guys in 100 years (not many do now except those who confuse self-obsession with depth). There are moments, especially the middle section, where Coltrane and co. hint at some melodic structure, some level of aesthetic appeal, but inevitably a stylized flourish ruins everything. I suppose it's good that someone pushed the 'repetitive droning and squawking' envelope, but do you really want to listen to him do it?Art reaches out, speaks to the universal, appeals to the heart. Jazz excludes, speaks in code, demands analysis. I prefer art."
2,Perplexity,"I like this title, but I do not understand why people is so excited about it. I mean, for the sixties it was really a breakthrough, I guess. But now there are many sax players that can play better than Coltrane, they are much polished and straight. I think about Kenny G., for instance. His rythmic session is much more regular, whereas Coltrane's session seems sometimes to loose the beat. And also Coltrane is not really precise... But the title is interesting at least as an historical recording, a first step towards the perfection of todays players."
5,A study in spiritual ecstacy.,"For all those seeking the ultimate jazz experience this is THE album. Man seeks for meaning by finding the beautiful aesthetic. Coletrane has helped all of us to find that moment and to think the moment was recorded. A Love Supreme stands right at the border between beauty and chaos. While many later avant garde works and even the later works of Coletrane run past that border and become difficult to listen to, A Love Supreme remains in the realm where the listener is allowed to enter the experience of the artist. A Love Supreme is the ultimate jazz album THE CLASSIC!!"
5,Classic Coltrane,"John Coltrane's expressionistic existentialist masterpiece is released in a superbly remastered edition with essential additional material. This album is the turning point for Coltrane, away from his past material that was closer to hard bop and into the realms of free jazz. This was just before he picked up the atonalities that would be trademark of his later recordings but gives the listener a chance of what is to come. Spiritually rich and expressionistic, it is one jazz's greatest albums. If you own the original album, it is worth the purchase for the additional disc. Outtakes of the album with Archie Shepp included, it also has a full length concert of the only time the album was performed publicly. By this time, Coltrane had picked up the dissonance of his later albums and to some listeners will be less satisfying but for those who appreciate Coltrane in all his complexity,is well appreciated. Highly recommended."
5,STIMULATING/STARTLING MUSIC,"I enjoy jazz...I'm far from thoroughly versed in the style though; I have a few key discs in my collection, that's it. A Love Supreme is one of them. A lot of good music sets a mood, but Coltrane's disc really talks...it's amazing. Where some musicians can hint at an idea, Coltrane rattles off a spiritual epic. If you're looking to add some stimulating, startling jazz to your collection (we're not talking Kenny G here...), this is your disc."
5,The Pinnacle of Modal Jazz,"John Coltrane is at his best on this recording. Some people dislike it because they believe it is excessively serious, but to me it is deeply emotional and even joyful. It really takes an open mind (and concentration) to enjoy this CD properly, but it will more than reward the listener for the energy he expends.Musically, it would be absurd to attack this recording; the writing, improvisation, and interaction are flawless.One word of warning: If you are someone who listens to music for simple entertainment or background, this is not the CD for you. Listening to this CD in the background would be like reading yourself to sleep with James Joyce's ""Ulysses"".It really boils down to how you see music. Some people just don't think of music as being a deeply expressive artistic outlet, and that's fine - but they won't enjoy this CD."
5,TRANE!!!!!!!!,"All that needs to be said about ""A Love Supreme"" is --- BUY IT! If this disc is not in your collection, you are missing out on one of the most vital pieces of music ever recorded. No matter what your musical tastes are, I guarantee you will find something of interest in Trane's visceral and evocative performance. A classic of sheer beauty and emotion. Peace."
5,"It sounds great, and ...",... I wonder how much the awesome result is due to the Rudy Van gelder re-mastering process rather than to the DSD-SACD new teach. I wonder sometimes if the music major are trying to sell us the n-th remastering and try to make us re-buy our music collection again and again. It would also be nice to compare the same re-mastering hi-rez DVD-A and DSD-SACD.BTW I am astonished how much better it is compared to my vynil (I did not buy the red-book CD waiting for a hi-rez re-issue :-) )5 stars to the music (I'd vote 6 starts if possible ...) and 5 stars to the sound
5,master takes,"john coltrane----LONG winded---from the first ""breath"" of this swAn song we all know as "" a love supreme""safe playing taken to exremes----maybe the best Long composition in jAzz ma tazzthe live stuff just hits hard"
4,Great introduction to improvisational jazz,"I'll be the first to admit I really don't know much about jazz or John Coltrane. But in search of something different I picked up this cd. It is certainly a departure from my 4/4 rock world, but I love it. It is adventurous and compelling. If you are like me and are wondering what all the fuss is about, go ahead and give this cd a spin, you'll be glad you did. There is a whole new world inside."
3,A bit annoying for my taste,"I am not really a jazz fan, but I bought this after taking a jazz class in college.Putting aside the spiritual theme and the ""John's Gift to God"" comments, I just want to comment on the instrumental music itself. I always get the distinct feeling that it is just too repetitive (in the title track, for instance, that repeated four-note theme just starts getting monotonous), and a lot of the songs don't really end up going anywhere. I have a hard time with this style. It just sounds like a bunch of notes, nothing that I would term ""catchy,"" nothing to latch onto and really remember after it's all done -- which is something I really like about the Dixieland, cool, and Swing styles of jazz music.I start thinking that if this instrumental music had been representing any other theme than Coltrane's so-called spiritual awakening, the album would not have gained as much respect. Taking the music alone, as instrumental jazz music, I have to admit that I grow weary of it fast."
5,"TRUELY A ""CLASSIC""","John Coltrane was truely ahead of his time! Vacuum tubes were still the state of the art when this album came out! Yet, the Fidelity is pretty amazing... Jimmy Garrison down-shifting on the Bass on the first cut ( ""Acknowlegement"" aka ""Love Supreme"" )with Elvin Jones and McKoy Tyner rounding things out, just Blew My Mind! If you DON'T ""feel"" this one, you have NO SOUL!"
3,Cant they even drill a hole right?,"This is not a review of the music. The music is of course awesome. But i get my copy of this record today and not only is the hole not drilled out all the way, but the label on one side is barely stuck on. This is not the first record i have purchased lately with badly drilled holes and poor label application.Once i drilled out the hole properly the record itself plays great."
5,I'm just a guy,"who said this record wasn't all that? I beg your pardon, you don't say. this record is not for a party, it's for your ears. This is pure joy. the guy that gave one star does not like jazz. listen to this late at night after your girlfriend broke up with you. this is life affirming it's hopeful it taps into all your emoticons and beyond. if i knew you i would just make you a copy but it's cheap enough. check it out when you are screwed up or to impress a lady. either way you will score."
5,"Unhelpful, but true","This album may serve as an acid test - if you don't like it, you don't like jazz, and never will. The flawless interplay of the four voices in this work builds upon all that came before and anticipates all that came after. Those who don't like it - and these are few an far between - are usually aggressively drowsy conservatives who listen to Coltrane wishing listfully that his genius had not arrived on the scene to disturb the sanguine haze that was American music in the late 50's. A Love Supreme created a new musical idiom in which the depth of human sentiment could be commiunicated. A towering accomplishment."
3,"Liked it, neither loved nor hated it","After reading about this in the context of Coltrane's autobiography, I thought I would either hate or love this. When I listened I was surprised to find that I just liked it. It's a good example of avant-garde jazz that sounds good, that's not so far out that it's hard to listen to. Influences from earlier types of jazz are combined with a classical sensibility. A spiritual feeling is there for those who can sense it."
3,Skip the extra tracks,The sound quality and performance of the extra tracks doesn't add anything to the original recording.
3,I respect the musician,"I have tried and tried to listen to this release. I appreciate a lot of Jazz artists, especially trumpeters, there's just something about a sax's tone that just puts me to sleep. And the Trane puts me out every time. Not because it's peaceful or dreamy. Because I find Coltrane BORING... okay I've said it! I'm guilty of a heinous lack of cool. Committed hearsay, blasphemy even!That said, Ornett Coleman IS inspirational, but the 'Trane - can keep on rolling right on outta' here, and it wouldn't bother me a bit. No offence intended, but that's my opinion."
3,"Otherwordly? Yes, out in space.","Not Coltrane's best. A meandering search for something more. There isn't much particularly lovely about the music. Sort of a match with ""My Favorite Things"": While that record toys with pop banality, ""...Supreme"" plays on the opposite edge of the groud, with spirituality and mysticism."
3,no noticeable difference,"I'd never taken primrose oil before but, since I have certain conditions that can potentially benefit from its use, I decided to give it a shot. I'm not able to tell if it does anything to help control inflammation. It does make me feel slightly relaxed. I take extra magnesium, B6, and omega 3 oil along with this. I have to say that I'll probably not order more when I'm done."
5,Seth Eastman Sketchbook,Came as promised - in great shape - very fair price - and delightful sketches from our state's past. What else can you ask for?
3,Update or not?,"I bought this unit as a replacement for an earlier Kenwood changer that was a few years old and was couple to an Echelon in dash DVD. The earlier unit was prone to skipping, especially with burned CD's for some reason. In that respect, the new unit is better. I have had it four weeks and not one skip.The only negatives are, the new changer seems to load discs slower than my old unit and the sound quality does not seem as good. I thought the newer unit might have an updated laser or better sampling rate, but it actually sounds thinner with less presence then my old Kenwood changer. I used my other changer for over five years and it still works fine. I suppose I would recommend this changer but I am somewhat disappointed in the sound quality. It in no way compares to the sound quality of the playback from my Echelon."
2,Lassie fans are learning not to get their hopes up,"When I first heard there was an upcoming Lassie release I got my hopes up. I hoped it was the beginning of proper season sets of the classic Lassie series. Of course, like most Lassie fans, I've learned to hope for the best but expect the worst. There's not many details on this listing yet, but from the cast list it appears to be the 2005 movie. So, instead of what I was hoping for, Lassie fans get a release of a recent movie, which is already available on DVD(ASIN: B000ICL3ME), with an impostor playing Lassie. Please Classic Media, start releasing full season sets of the classic series with complete uncut episodes in chronological order!!!"
4,Easy read that's fun and serious.,A nice collection of editorials and essays written by Meek over a 50-year period from a college editorial in the 50s to current opinions of potential presidential candidates. His humor is biting and his depth of knowledge is impressive. You may not agree with them all but you WILL think about them.
2,Inexpensive.......but cheap,"Fits ok. Stretches on easily (does not snap). No cut outs for any of the buttons on the middle of the phone (Palm Treo 755p) Can't see the power, green, five way, or the menu buttons. You either have to remember where they are, or use a fine blade to cut out the holes. Matte black. Will offer some protection against scratches. It does fit the qwerty keyboard nicely, no obstruction of any of these keys. Also no obstruction of the camera lens. Can't open the card slot-cut out too small. OK for now, but will keep looking for one that fits correctly."
2,doesn't actually snap!,"Received case well packaged and fast shipping! The case itself form fits phone fine, but does not snap well together. The first time I tried one of the top tabs broke. So for temporary purposes until I get a new case I used a dab of Gorilla glue to hold the upper two halves together. Obviously if I have to reset the phone this will be the end of the case. Only 3 bucks, but I would put that money towards a soft silicone case."
4,Silicone Case for Palm Treo 755p,I am enjoying its use. The only issue is one of manufacturing. The opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off/on control does not align with the control. It is difficult to move the control. I modified the case by making a small cut to it.
4,Good!,I would have wanted to know before buying it that the silicon was hard and is not as soft as I thought. However it is a good protector for the phone.
3,Not his best stuff.,"This 4 song e.p. is OK, but not that great, I listen to it sometimes, but his very low rapping over heavy bass is hard to hear. I picked it up just to have, and listen to every once in a while, when I need a change. This again is not his best but pick it up if you are a fan."
2,Unhearable,its too hard to hear him the music always drowns him out he needs to get a better producer his brother aint doin too good a job.boomin words from hell is much better.this is aight tho
4,A very good book,"Es un buen libro y a pesar de tener muchos años, fue de gran utilidad. Pude aprender muchas cosas de la musica que hacia tiempo lo quería aprender. Recomiendo este libro"
2,THE SPACE STATION IS FALLING,"In this sequel to the original Stratos 4 anime, our four heroines are finally able to take a breather from the constant bombardment of Earth by alien space seeds. Uh, let me correct that, no rest is given when one of the Comet Blaster orbiting satellites is hit by a piece of space debris. There's no way for it to be saved and it's too big to burn up in the atmosphere so it must be destroyed before it hits the Earth. As two Comet Blasters man a desperate mission to rescue the space stations crew, Shizuha, Ayamo, Mikaze, and Karin set out to vaporize it.The two episodes on this dvd really didn't do much for me. They did not extend the story of the original series or bring anything new to the show. Instead of meteors, we have a space station. It was a little funny but I think that Stratos 4 is pretty much played out. Unless you take it in a different direction and get away from the whole meteor blasting business. This is kinda like a skimpy dessert after the main course."
4,Bliss,"If by ""simple"" used in the album's title means less here, than once again, less is more with Evan's Magnet. This guy, one of Norway's music gems, is quite simply a musical genius. Evan's voice is angelic, quite polished, and deeply soothing. What you'll find here in Simple Life, just like Magnet's other albums, is his brilliant mixing of indie folk, beats, rasta jams, horns and strings. It works, and it will hook you. Magnet does this mix, like no other, again here perfectly in Simple Life-just like we've come to love and expect from him time and again. Get this album pronto, like any of his others, you won't be disappointed."
4,Very strong scent,"This product should really be called cream perfume.This hand cream has a lovely scent but is the scent is very strong, much stronger than it was in other of the Perlier Peony scent products I've used.If Amazon offered 1/2 stars in their rating stars I would have given it 4-1/2 rather than a 4. The ""cream"" itself isn't anything special by providing more softness or moisture than much less expensive national brand products and in reality probably a little less.What you're buying this product for is the scent, not the softening."
5,Hard to find this product now.,I like this scent and it is no longer made in this particular configuration...I was happy to find it so reasonably priced here.
5,Great Christmas Songs,I love all this music by the Celtic Woman. I purchased this and one other Christmas cd. I also purchased the Celtic Woman cd. The most beautiful music.
3,I wanted to really like this CD,"I ordered this Cd for Yule, hoping there would be a few songs that would appeal to the season for my spiritual path.(Pagan) This Cd would fit others, who liked mostly familar songs of this time of year.Donna Swindells"
3,"Well performed, but somewhat trite","All of the standard Christmas fare is there, but I've heard Maire in better voice, and the arrangements are slightly lacking.I like it, but it's not a classic.Rich"
5,Irish Christmas = Moya Brennan,"Wonderful, Wonderful - I love it - I'm listening to it even now BEFORE Christmas season - it's ethreal and heavenly."
4,not what expected,"This album is not what I expected from Moya, based on the four other Moya albums I have. I expected something with a little more Irish/Celtic ambience. The inclusion of a Ukranian song (Carol of the Bells) was rather annoying in an ""Irish"" Christmas, though the song is pretty good in its own right. For what it is, a straightforward Christmas album with an Irish/Celtic tint, it is quite good."
4,1993 Jeep Wrangler YJ,"The product works great on the driver side for a 1993 Jeep Wrangler YJ, but since the prong is angled, I had to mount it upside down on the passenger side because of clearance issues. Overall, it gets the job done"
3,Not your first read,"I would read "" Alchemy & Mysticism"" first.Alexander Roob says in 3 pages what it takes 400 pages of reading to say in this book. I was exposed to Peter by his writings in the Journal Parabola. I was impressed and thought I would give it a try. He is a informative writer but in this book he comes across like someone who has just had a conversion experience and makes the same point over and over. His latest book is shorter and its ties to the east are informative. In his section on sex and spiral energy, any good book on Qi Quong and the microcosmic orbit does a better job of defining what he mentions about Aphrodite. When he talks about her and Hermes as a dualist process thinker, I think of senses and thought. The book has its merits but is not read to start with."
1,A Definite Miss,Attention teachers of expository writing:Kingsley can well be used as the quintessential example of an author who disrespects his readers.
3,Enjoyable film,The film was a little puzzling at times. I did enjoy it in the end. Great story line and very talented actors. Though I thought Melanie Griffith was a little hollow. Second viewing is a must.
5,Awesome,This film is about civil rights. Ads don't do it justice. Very good film! I enjoyed it years ago and am glad to have foundit nonlinear.
3,"Strange movie, but good lessons!","The movie's incredible concept was spoiled by the way they wrote Melanie Griffith's character.Her little nephew is a strong young man who stands up against the evil sheriff and risks it all. His father is a man who stands by his son even as their fight to end racism is life-threatening.It was 2 major stories going on at once - the one that didn't involve Ms. Griffith was realistic. Her character and story was just very annoying. Who actually could carry around a severed head for weeks without being caught?This could have been a great movie if her character and story were better.Anyway, I recommend it with reservations. The plot is messy and the story drags."
4,Crazy About Alabama in Arizona,"Crazy In Alabama is engrossing and entertaining with the excellent re-creation of the mid-60's with respect to cars, fashions, and the civil rights movement.All actors were superbly cast for their roles. Not bad directing Mr. Banderas; You may have another artistic venue or outlet, yet. There are two stories simultaneously being told here. Yes, they are both effective and do meet at the end of the road for purpose and not filler. The title itself is also double edged meaning ; It is indicative of the racial tension and madness in Alabama happening while Lucille is on her cross country/Hollywood quest (to lay certain ghosts of the past to rest as well)..."
1,Yuck!,"This is not a condemnation of Initial D 4th Stage which is awesome. This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD's are 16:9 and they're not, they're 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire TV or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV. I never would've bought this if I had known what was in store for me after I popped it into my player."
1,Doesn't last long,"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband. They have been washed 2 times and they are already faded, shaggy and the seams are coming apart on the legs. He wants to throw them away after only having them for 2 weeks."
1,very badly sized and can't return it since I washed it before trying it on,very badly sized and can't return it since I washed it before trying it on
4,silk better than satin,"I bought this pair of silk sleep pants and another pair of satin sleep pants. Although both were fine, the silk is superior in comfort and worth the difference in price."
3,difficult to size,"Yes I do like these silk pajamas. I'm 6'0"", 210 lbs., 36"" waist 31""-32"" pant length.I went w/ the XL thinking that they'd still be fine if a bit loose and baggy. They fit great except the pant length is way too long.Great quality, stitched well, but sizing too odd, as I'm sure the Large would be too small for me.I think a 3 * review is appropriate."
4,Great Silk Pants Except:,"Great Silk Pants Except My Husband wears a Size Large Pants in everything and with these pants I wish i would of ordered an Extra Large, they are a little short on him (Looks like he's waiting for a flood).I ordered the Burgandy and Blue and the colors are so Deep and Rich.Very Nice. They wash nice also."
5,helped with bypass recovery,"My husband was recovering from bypass surgery and could not slide forward to get out of chair, bed etc. With the silk Pajamas he could get to the edge of the the seat and then stand with the aid of the walker. Amazon was the only place I could find this product. That was 6 weeks ago. He likes them so well he won't wear anything else, They have been laundered many times and still look like new"
1,"Feel nice, don't hold up",I bought a pair in maroon and they were a little short but fine. The problem was that they started coming apart at the seams after 2 months. Will definitely be looking to a different company for a replacement pair.
2,"Nice material, but that's about it.","I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it."
5,Review for Intimo Silk Pant,"I have ordered this same pajama pant before, and they wear well. The size is also accurate. Color is true to photo."
1,"A Bad, Bad Machine","I purchased one of these players from Discount Jungle, and would not recommend you do so, too. After the first three test cassettes the machine would not load any more tapes, so back it went. The company was apologetic and sent another shipment right away, but I have my suspicions it was a different player at all, as this one would not load a single tape. In all, I've lost a month of VHS use and am out nearly the cost of the product itself in return shipping charges, not to mention the inconvenience of repackaging and taking time out of my life to do the return. Do you have that kind of time and money?"
1,Don't buy,"I purchased this Sony VCR at a Target, thinking you can rely on Sony, well I was wrong. It did not record a very good quality picture from my TV (cable). I tried switching tapes, and recorded in both EP and SP, but there was always some kind of disturbance seemingly from one particular point in the reel/head/whatever. It occurred regularly in playback, about every few seconds at the beginning of the tape, and then occurring in shorter intervals toward the end of the tape. Oh, and I used new Sony tapes, which did fine on my older Sony VCR...go figure, but don't buy it."
2,Sony makes great TVs not VCRs,"I have been shopping for a new VCR since both of my much older ones died (within a month of each other!). My Toshiba and my RCA, both made it to about 8 or 9 years old. In doing the shopping math - my old VCR repairman kept admonishing me to stay away from the Sony - good TVs and other electronics, but VCRs are not their forte, he said. In doing so, I found he was right, as also evidenced by the other reviews from guests. My VCR repairman would know, he repairs what can't be returned! So, now I'm looking at Panasonic and RCA. Thanks to all of you who tried to warn me - I'll get over my system not being totally Sony. I had to learn the hard way though.... still, why can't Sony make a VCR that works quietly?"
1,Sony vcr # SLVN55,Yo i had this sony For about a year now and this thing is horrible it has no user friendly menus and ...it makes a whole lot of noise when it plays a tape it sounds like a vacuum cleaner when it plays tapes!! Im out!!
2,Disappointed,"I own another Sony VCR (SLV N-71) which is nice. This one was for the kids, but it's going back. The VCR is noisy - very distracting. Picture is fair. I expect more from Sony products."
4,Over all quite pleased,"I have two other Sony VCRs...but except for two short comings are no better. These two failing occur in the pause and slow modes in which there is too much video noise. All other features work quite well, with the flash rewind a dream. The remote also deserves high marks for its ease of use.Best of all is the picture quality which ranges from very good to excellent... I'd rate it a best buy."
2,SONY loudness,It plays fine but the rewind and fast forward is a loud motor running. I'm going to return it for perhaps another SONY or Panasonic.
2,A peculiarity from Poverty Row.,"The oddities of this Monogram semi-horror film begin with the title! The ""ghost"" in question is NOT invisible, and is not really a ghost. Also, the shadow of an ape appears on the main title card. (Don't ask me, I'm only the reviewer.) The various plot twists contain no supernatural or science fiction elements, and yet are even less plausible than those of other Monogram horrors. The director, Joseph Lewis, displays almost none of the talent he showed in his later films. Only the presence of Bela Lugosi makes this one worthwhile. The role of ""Dr. Kessler"" is a Jekyll/Hyde character, so Lugosi is playing a normal, likeable guy during most of his screen time, which makes this one of his more unusual roles. Also, Clarence Muse is good as the butler."
1,The Invisible Plot,"Even Bela Lugosi couldn't save this turkey. The plot is idiotic, the supporting cast is dreadful, and the film is incredibly boring. Definitely not a classic."
2,The One Redeeming Feature of This Piece of Tripe.,"What a pathetic, degrading waste of talent on the part of actor Bela Lugosi, cast ludicrously in what comes close to equaling such bottom-of-the-barrel schlock as BRIDE OF THE MONSTER. And yet...and yet......if you love Lugosi's mellifluous, Hungarian-accented intonations (as I do), just sit back and ignore (or ""enjoy"") the film's imbecilic dialogue, implausible plot, stilted acting, and utterly hilarious direction, and allow yourself to be carried away by the erstwhile treasured voice that gave Bela Lugosi the fame and stature he so rightfully deserved back in the 30s from such memorable films as THE RAVEN, THE BLACK CAT, THE INVISIBLE RAY, SON OF FRANKENSTEIN and, of course, DRACULA."
3,You can get all choked up watching this movie,"This is a fast-moving psychological thriller. Story and screenplay by Helen and Al Martin. Produced by Sam Katzman; you will recognize his style or lack of.Mr. Kessler (Bela Lugosi) is missing his wife (Betty Compson) but doesn't know it and assumes that she will return one day. His daughter Virginia (Polly Ann Young) tries to keep the invisible Mrs. Kessler from the prying eyes of her boyfriend Ralph (John McGuire). Meantime there is some mysterious ghost in the house it is dispatching this person and that at arbitrary times seemingly for arbitrary reasons. What can this mean? There may be more to this story than just a straightforward murder movie. What is the maid hiding? What is Jules (Ernie Adams) hiding?Will the ghostly found before they all get strung out?The film is short and in black and white. One advantage of the short is to get right to the point. It makes great filler but once you have seen it, you have seen it.Glen or Glenda ~ Bela Lugosi"
1,"Waste of money-""master""","The system required a check in the rating box so I gave it a one, which is probably two too many. I have tried/owned two of these devices. The concept is good, but that is the end of the line for this product. As someone else noted the bands are not strong enough to withstand even an attempt to put your finger thru the finger holes. I even continued to try and use mine after the first hole tore loose with continued failure of the bands. At the price even if used as a squeeze ball it is too expensive."
4,colorado,this books give one an excellant felling for the hardship of the time. Also give us a deeper respect for our older family members who went through the ordeal
3,Vital Forms,Companion volume to an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art that celebrated the varied responses of artists and designers to a turbulent era-everything from abstract expressionism to Cadillac tail fins and the biomorphic furniture of Isamu Noguchi.
3,Not really a Guide.,"This book is more of a research summary than a guide to helping your child. It is interesting and enlightening on the subject of research that has been done on kids social interaction, but its limited material on how to help your child is vague and not very convincing. It left me feeling that: yes, I recognized my daughter as a socially unsuccessful child, but I didn't know what to do about it. If you want an excellent how-to guide, try ""Good Friends are Hard to Find"" by Fred Frankel."
2,Fairly enjoyable but of questionable origin,"I seriously question the validity of these stories as real Victorian writing. As another reviewer mentioned, there are no background and bibliographic references whatsoever. I would at least expect approximate dates and publishers of the original texts.My guess is that they were written by a man familiar with Victorian erotica, but some time after the era ended. One clue is that one story describes the woman as a ""lesbian,"" a word which didn't come into popular use until well after the Victorian era. Sexologists began using it in 1889, but it is really doubtful that a writer of common porn would be aware of the most recently published scientific writing.On the other hand, the stories are entertaining as some ridiculous little pieces of erotica."
2,Doesn't do timeshifting with my Mitsubishi,This product I got yesterday doesn't do all its features when connected to my Mitsubishi 62525. It seemed to work ok but when I actually tried to record something it would lose its connection. Will probably return it if I can't get it to be stable this weekend.
4,Just the right size!,"This product fits perfectly on my wrists. It's light but at the same time it adds a little variety to your workout. If you are just a beginner like me, I highly recommend this product."
2,Too tiny even for a tiny girl.,"I am 5'3"" and weigh 100lbs and have very tiny hands and wrists. These weights are so tiny, and they barely stretch, so I can hardly even get them on my wrists. Plus, the 1 lb weight is not nearly enough for me."
1,Product misrepresented,Discription says 2-2pound wrist weights. Product received was 2-1pound wrist weights. A deceptive rip-off!
1,Too small!,"I recently purchased these wrist weights, thinking I'd be able to use them as ankle weights. I couldn't get them over my foot, but this was completely understandable because they are in fact wrist weights. This would have been fine were it not for the fact that the weights don't even fit over my hands! I am quite skinny, and pretty small, so even when I tried my best to get them on my wrist, I was cutting off my own circulation.I don't know if it was just me or some kind of fluke, but they were definitely too small, and I can't use them so I will be sending them back."
3,I bought these,"For an ex, she never used them. Thought they were expensive paperweights. They are. Pass."
5,Valeo WW2 2-Pound Wrist Weights,"These are super soft, like a silky terry cloth. These are a bit on the small side for a medium-large framed woman's wrist. However, these are perfect for a child's wrist or even ankle. These are used in my child's therapy, and they fit perfectly on an 8 yr old's wrists and ankles. Very comfortable."
3,Too Small,Its seemed like it would be a good product. The material felt nice. It was just impossible to put on my wrist
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"The day I received these they tore open and the little beads and grannules on the inside started to come out, not to mention I have about a 5 and 1/2 inch wrist and small hands and it is very difficult to slip these on over my hands onto my wrists. I dont see how anyone with larger hands and wrists could wear them. My advice is dont waste your money because once they tear it is not worth the shipping to send them back!!"
3,tiny wrists,These work great but are really small. I have really small hands and wrists and they are difficult to get on. I was thinking they were the wrap around velcro kind when I ordered them.
2,Never quite worked for me,"I was really excited about adding these to my cardio workout, just to add a bit of weight without feeling it too much. That was the idea anyway. The issue is they didn't fit well, and there was no way to adjust them. I'm a 6'1"" tall woman with the proportions to go with the height, so I'm not dainty. These were tight on my wrists from the start. I wore them a few times thinking with use the material would stretch a bit, but the material just came apart at the seams and the sand inside started to spill out. Even then it wasn't THAT tight, I wouldn't have thought it would just fall apart. Even if they did fit I imagine they wouldn't last very long.For smaller people these will work out fine, but for people who are more robust, including most men, these simply won't work out very well. I wish the adjustable kind came in lighter weights."
2,Not Happy,As soon as I opened the package I knew something wasn't right because there was sand inside. I put them on later in the day and there was sand on my arm. I finally found the hole in one of the weights. Not happy to say the least.
2,I didn't like them,Can't say if this is a good product or not but the really got in the way while I was typing on my computer at work. My doctor suggested them for my tremors but they where to uncomfortable for me. You may like them for what you are using them for. Not a negative review this is more a personal choice review.
3,Not as good as it looks.,"On the picture, the wrist weights look like they have a sleek and modern design. Instead once you get them the fabric feels rough like a sack cloth instead of the smooth texture of Lycra I was expecting. In other words they look and feel like bean bags attached to your wrists, but I guess you get what you pay for. Plus, they work, and that's all that matters."
1,Grrrrrrr-___-,"I was actually disappointed with these thing; after the second time I wore them, the little rocks were coming out from the were its sown together at. And its very annoying having a thousand little rocks in your shoe walking around."
3,Leaky,"One of the weights started leaking sand from the seem after only a few uses. I used a little duct tape to patch it up and this has held for many months. But still, really...."
2,Too Small,It hurts my wrist to slip this on and off. It would have been much better if it had a velco strip or something where you could wrap it around the wrist instead of having to force it on.
5,wrist weights,I have small; tiny wrists so the weights fit fine and they are a great enhancement to my daily workout. In fact I wear then almost everyday all day long except when I am sleeping.
4,Too lite,The product is well made but just to small to easily get over my hands to place on my wrists....once on they are comfortable..but again too lite for my needs...made for small people I think..i should look for a bigger set...
3,Little too small for me,"I'm an average height woman, medium boned, slightly overweight but not obese. I could get these on my wrists, but it took some effort. I took them off after 5 minutes. They are the right weight and I can use them, but I think they would have been better if there was some way to make them open up. Velcro, snaps, or just some elastic would have made these worth 4 or 5 stars. As it is, they won't work very well for adults, especially larger adults."
4,Comfortable,I agree with the other reviews that you have to have thin wrists for this to fit/be comfortable. I'm quite petite and have a hard time slipping on the wrist weights.
1,Valeo WW2 2-lb wrist weights,"I used the weights once. Well, they almost made it..one of the wrist weights came apart at the seam and sand leaked all over the carpet."
2,Valeo wrist weights,The wrist weight are one size that may be used by a very tiny and thin adult of 100 lbs or a child. I could not get them over my hand to my wrist. The advertising should say what size the hand needs to be and to use them.
3,not a bad product but it does have its limitations,"great to accompany other advanced weight regiments. however, depending on your wrist size, you might end up overstretching them when you put it on causing the seems to unravel and the contents to come out a bit."
2,Good only for the first few days,"So i purchased these weights a few days ago and they appeared very comfortable. But after a few days, the cloth started to expand and then sand started to seep through. This product was only good for teh first few days of purchase."
3,Wrist Weights,"Not bad for the price, they have no adjustments, I have large hands and wrist, so they fit a little tight and are a little hard to get on. But they do the trick."
2,Really really small,"Let me start by saying there is nothing ""wrong"" with these weights. The quality is great, and the material is soft. However, when people say small...they mean it! I am a petite size 2 and they only barely fit. I actually got these for therapy use for my one-year old's ankles and these were the only one-pounders I could find. They fit my chuncky little one just perfectly."
3,1-Pound wrist weights not 2-Pound,"These say 2-Pound wrist weights but if you read the information better it is 2 wrist weights, 1-pound each. I don't know why it is advertised like this. Other Valeo products come in pairs, like the 10-lb hand weights, which are advertised as 10-pounds and you get two not as 20-pounds hand weights. Uh Why?They fit over my hands and wrist fine."
2,"Some chapters were good, some were bad, all in all just okay","I got this book as a free gift for attending a CRM conference. Some of the author's points are valid--the book was probably written before a lot of this material became obvious. (One of these days, I'm going to find a book that says ""People issues don't matter if your company's managers don't have a customer focus or your firm doesnt have the necessary IT infrastructure in place."" Can't wait for that.)I worked for Lucent in the 1990s and would swear that we coined the phrase ""People Process and Technology."" Anyway, it's been worn pretty thin. The tone of the book was a bit pedantic and stiff and so I found it a bit hard to to get through. I like Paul Greenberg's and Jill Dyche's CRM books much better, though, and would recommend them over this one, along with a new book called ""Why They Don't Buy"" by Max McKeown that is definitely the go-to book for CRM automation!"
2,Junk.....,Bright light but they break the second you drop your flashlight. I would expect a much more durable product for the price. Pony up for a LED replacement and take the time to retrofit it. That is the only way to go with these surefire lights.
5,Just a lovely as picture,I bought this pillow and I was very nervous that it wouldn't be as lovely as the picture. I'm not one for buying this without touching it but I was pleasantly surprise. It is absolutely lovely and I'm very happy I made the purchase.
4,No surprises,This order arrived timely and was exactly what was advertised... now I just need to dedicate time to going through the program.
5,the best music for the best videogame,"This Cd contains every track you hear in the video game. If you liked the game, you'll love this cd, just to hear it is like playing the game all over again. A MUST HAVE FOR ZELDA FANS."
4,"Good, but short","I loved that they have EVERY SINGLE music from the game in it, but I was disappointed to find how short some of the tracks are. Most all of them only play one loop of a track, making the songs very short. For example, the Fire Temple track is just over 40 seconds long... I just wish they made this like 3 CDs and extended the tracks to at least 2 minutes each.But that's the only thing I don't like... other than that its great! If you liked the OoT music, this is a must buy!"
5,Ocarina of Time,"This is a great cd! It includes all the wonderful music from the 1999 award winning n64 game, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.There are 82 tracks to this cd, some that last a few seconds long... some that last a few minutes long. My favorite is the ""End Credits."" This is the song played after beating the game and is truly beautiful!! I love it!!"
5,kool,"first of all, the music on zelda ocarina of time matches the setting you are in. for example, listen to the water temple music. most people get an image of a watery or icy place. the game's songs impressed many people im sure. the game is already great by it self, but the music just takes it to the next level."
5,Wonderful,"I loved the compositions from the game and I think Nobuo Uematsu is a great composer, fitting perfect music for perfect environments.However, I could not abide the repetative synthesised instruments that accompanied the music on most occasions. I recently bought the original FF8, thinking they perhaps implemented real instruments..but no luck.Then I saw this! Absolutely amazing... A single pianist plays 13 of the greatest FF8 tracks, with clever re-arrangements, you can listen to this, fully imersed in the Final Fantasy atmosphere. My highlight must be the card game theme, shuffle or boogie...an excellent take on the 12 bar blues. Anyway, yes, buy this! Also you get it in Japanese packaging...which is always good, for some bizarre reason the have a little plastic see-though sheath which the real case goes in...lovely."
4,Nice to have in your collection..,"Just like the other Final Fantasy Music Collections, this CD is a ""must-have"" one (although it's not the best of Uematsu). Since the theme for Final Fantasy VIII is ""love"", this CD gives you the sense of sweet, loving and relaxing. The first track is ""Blue Fields"" and followed by a super hit, ""Eyes on me"", track which is a newly rearranged one (But still very good). The rest of the CD gives you the same sensation. I find this CD is good for my relaxing day and before bed time and everytime I listen to it, I just like it more and more. As I said, if you like final fantasy series and Uematsu's work, you will like this CD."
2,A disappointing entry in the Frommer series,"I travel extensively and am a fan of Frommer's guides which I generally find to have a nice assortment of options in varying price ranges. The volume on South Africa however, was a great disappointment. If Frommer's were to be believed, you had to pay $200 and up for a decent hotel room. Fortunately I have often traveled in South Africa, enjoyed its reasonably priced accomodations, and knew such prices were nonsense. I stayed in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban and other top destinations in season for less than half that much. The guide also overlooked destinations a bit off the beaten path and proved of so little use to me that I didn't bother to pack it home with me. I strongly suggest the Eyewitness guide instead or just surf the web for tons of great information from the South African Tourism Board."
5,Frommers South Africa,"My family and I took five books about South Africa with us, and this is the book we used and relied on the most. It proved to be the most accurate with what we experienced once there, and the book itself was the easiest to use in its layout and organization."
4,Good Guide,Although I have yet to visit South Africa (so I can't verify the accuracy) it seems to give you a nice write up on the major tourist areas. Like all guides it can not cover every topic that might be of interest to one particular reader.
5,Great planner book,"This book, as all the Frommer series, is very good to help you plan a trip. The recommendations are often the same as you will find on Tripadvisor which increase my confidence level, but in the book you get really detailed information with contact numbers and websites. They have maps of each area with the interest point marked on it, this is a great planning tool; you can really figure better in what order to schedule visits. Yes, other boks have more photos, this one definitely does not but that is why it's a good planner, it has INFORMATION. Those pretty DK books are nice to look at but useless to plan with. I would like to see them update more frequently but reality is that the information does not really change that often, so all in all the book is great."
1,What a disappointment.,"We are fans of Frommer's Guide books from previous trips and choose this book from Amazon.com without reviewing it the old fashioned way - browsing through the pages/sections. Too late we discovered the book barely mentioned our destination points: Pretoria (Tshwane), and a private game reserve bordering Kruger National Park. We missed the 'where to dine' suggestions and places of interest in/near Pretoria, which have been particularly helpful in the past.In addition, we found at least one map reference that sent the reader to a page that had no corresponding text to the map cross reference. We ended up leaving the book at home."
1,Buy a different guidebook,This guidebook is a waste of money - info is too scattered and does not address areas I will be visiting
5,Loaded with information,"I am preparing for a trip to South Africa in May to join my daughter that is studying abroad in Cape Town. I anticipate that the information packed in the pages of this book will be very helpful in making contacts with hotels, adventure planners, and restaurants. With the help from the chapter on Victoria Falls, we anticipate having a successful trip through Zimbabwe as well."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"School Escape.Cat Among the Pigeons is a mystery involving a tiny tin-pot country, revolution, and jewellery.Poirot gets involved with an investigation at a very toffy girl's school, and he doesn't really expect to get involved in international intrigue, but it doesn't take him long to work out something odd is going on."
4,review,here's another one of agatha christie's classics... the title provides the clue to what the novel's mostly about... a page-turner which will keep readers entertained till the very end...
4,Clever and involving,"This is one of Christie's best later works and it shows she can still weave intricate plots and characters together with effective ease. Great atmosphere and story, with Poirot popping up almost toward the end. You'll never see any of the final threads coming. Perhaps her most entertaining book of the 1950's."
4,Poirot Solves Murder Mystery At English Boarding School,"The plot is simple, the characters memorable, and the clues, motives, and suspects pure Christie in this wonderful mystery that takes place at an English boarding school for girls.A young prince of a Middle East kingdom is killed in a flying accident and leaves behind a valuable collection of jewels to be smuggled into England by his friend Bob Rawlinson. It is believed the jewels will turn up at Meadowbank School since not only the prince's sister but also the sister and niece of Bob Rawlinson are all students there. Not surprisingly, murder after murder takes place at the prestigious school. Everyone from the headmistress and teachers to the students and parents are suspects until Poirot's clever little grey cells solve the mystery."
2,Meh.,"An interesting story, but the author tried to do too much in 400 pages. Too many characters and too many voices resulted in a somewhat awkward tale full of flat, one-note caricatures. At first, I found it somewhat misogynistic, as the first hundred pages lacked a single female character that wasn't a monster, a nutjob, or a complete waste of oxygen; as I read on, I realized that the male characters weren't any better, there were just more of them. Being un-Christian, and especially un-Catholic, I just didn't ""get"" a lot of the horror aspects of this book, either. Ho-hum, the Succubus is killing someone else now, next? This is the author's first novel, though, so maybe the next attempt will be better. Not a horrible book, but not compelling enough to take with me to finish on a plane."
3,Too Many Story Lines,"Michael Marono is a superb writer. His style is beautiful. His descriptive prose is original and does nothing to deviate from the story, in fact, it enhances it. My problem with the book was that there was simply too many characters. It got real annoying trying to remember names and storylines. Plus, I hated when the author would begin a new segment with three or four paragraphs of descriptive writing without informing the reader of who the heck he was talking about. Dawn Song is a good solid story that comes across as convoluted at times."
5,Loved it all!,"As a fan of the horror genre I am very often forced to sit through a book by a well known author that although has the major affect of scaring me out of my wits, rarely gets deep into my own personal life. Mr. Marano has succeeded where others have failed me!From the moment I picked this book up, I just couldn't put it down until I finished the story.The story of two Princes of Hell each trying to take over the world was as gripping as it was frightening, and left me wanting more from this author. His style of prose was just amazing.Of course the real good stuff is the emotional roller coaster you get the privilege to be on from almost page one!This book takes you everywhere, from sorrow to hopeful, and taking little pitstops at each emotion along the way.With characters I could really feel for, the struggle for Earth was just a beautiful mix of great insight and moments of pure suspense.Pick it up if you can, it's a great read!"
2,Needs a good editor,"Interesting concept, some interesting characters, but too much. The language gets so heavy handed -- how many similes and metaphors can you take -- and melodrama, boy! At times this book was like reading the worst sections of Anne Rice's Violin over and over and over ... Yeah, yeah, yeah .. I got it already! Move on."
2,Damnation by Disjointure,"I enjoyed the storyline and charactor development. It should have been a 'good read' but was, for me, spoilt by cumbersome presentation and 'arty' expression. I was looking for a story which the theme promised but it got lost in the litteray world. Why can't these writers present ideas and thoughts simply? Complexity does not equate with 'quality'. I also deplore the trend of many a horror novel nowadays having to have a statutary gay component. What's wrong with a bit of plain old spine chilling with a touch of straight on the side?When I finished this story I was not desperately looking for another by the same author! Compare this to ""The Stake' or ""Crota' which where fun reads."
2,.....eh....,it was well written and i probably would have enjoyed the plot had i been able to follow it. i lost interest before the end and lost the book...no sweat off my back. it was nothing special and it would probably be better going to the library.
1,"Boring, pointless, meandering","Mr. Marano's story wanders...and wanders... and wanders. His characters don't interact, and their development is pointless. This book is fully 200 pages too long. How long can the demons of Hell just sit and stir to existence and still keep our attention? Not 250 pages! There are some good moments, such as the Succubus inhabiting the mouse, but they are few and far between. The premise of this novel was so very promising -- I was very excited to read it. And I was let down completely. Mr. Marano, please, next time you have a good idea for a story, please write a story, not an epic adventure of style."
5,Great buy!,"This was a great buy. It seems it's shrunk lines in my forehead to a nicer size. It's also a great moisturizer for anything, I've used it on my lips, nose, eyes. Nothing irritant about emu oil competitors prices much higher for no reason. You won't be disappointed."
1,not really,"I tried this product, noticed absolutely no difference in the appearance in my skin, wrinkles or anything else, just saying"
3,soft face,"I have been using this product for a few weeks not sure how long it is going to take to see results for the wrinkles to fade , but it does make your skin soft and your lips soft too good on hands as well after I apply i just rub my hands but ,I really want to see results with my wrinkles any one know if it works for this as it says it does? or is it just a good moisturizer for the face ?"
5,Everything perfect !,Could not have asked for a smoother transaction. Timely delivery and intact product. Thank you !
1,Triple Refined Emu Oil,"I don't think the product does what they say it will do which makes it a very expensive bottle of oil. The program would not let me submit wtih no stars, which is what I would give the product based on the claims for the products usage."
5,Seals In Moisture...,"Love this oil over or mixed with my other face care products. If you use glycolic washes or treatment, you may want to consider using this afterwards. The bottle with the dropper works fine for easy control over how much you want to use. The product last a very long time making it a real bargain for such good product. For me, there is no offensive smell.I put on a light cream, add Marie Veronique sunscreen, them use my powder foundation. Just let the oil dry a little prior to using your foundation.I will buy again and again!"
4,SEEMS TO WORKING GREAT,"Not greasy and i feel like I can see a difference already after less than a month. Will buy again,"
5,Mesmerizingly Cute,"Slinky Malinki, the star of the story, creeps out of the house at night to look for the other cats in the neighbourhood to play. But what happens when Scarface Claw appears?A very cute book, written in the form of poetry, children learn all about rhyming words and various characteristics of cats.Lovely illustrations, adults would love this book as much as the children."
5,"Solid Album, great comback","Not as fun as the second album, not as accessible as the first... probably the best whole album from SDRE. Some great songs... ""Two Promises"", ""100 Million"" the title track and ""Guitar and Video Games"" stand out as some of SDRE's best.Does require a couple of listens to to get truly into, but rewarding in the end."
4,Amazon should let you rate with 1/2's,"I'm actually giving it 4.5 stars. I am a huge SDRE fan. I have all their cd's and this one contains some of my favorite SDRE songs and some of the ones I like the least. Pillars, Every Shining Time, and What It Feels Like To Be Something On are amazing. They are beautiful and complex and they alone are worth the $... However, Roses in Water and Prophet are not up to the standards I set for SDRE. Otherwise, this is an amazing CD from one of the best indie/alternative rock bands of the 90's. I definately recommend buying it and also ""Diary"", their excellent debut cd, if you don't already own it."
4,Good album,"I like this album a lot. There's a lot of power and swirling guitars, and the melodies just knock you flat. Enigk's soaring tenor is at its most tremendous here. Every Shining Time you Arrive is a classic, and #9, the title of which contains a dirty word, has one of the most beautiful and jarring transitions I've heard in years. Great CD.On another note, I think it's funny that a previous reviewer, Heidikakis from NY, lifted almost all of her(his?) review from pitchforkmedia.com...Why would someone do that? I'm sure that the folk at pitchforkmedia.com aren't pleased."
2,The Day That Sunny Day Died,"When I bought this album, I felt like crying. My favorite band, Sunny Day Real Estate, had reformed and I was thrilled. Then when I actually heard the CD, it was just a slap in the face. Sunny Day sounds nothing like they did in ""Diary"" or ""LP2"" anymore. They are more of a rather watered-down alternative rock. ""Every Shining Time You Arrive"" is definetely a great song, but there's no other song on the CD that would make you want to buy it. Let's face it...Sunny Day is dead, but what they did in their first two CDs makes them legendary."
2,I'm sorry,"This album is just plainly a dissapointment. Half the album is brilliant and the other half, well they should have just put this out as and e.p. with only half of the songs. Sure Pillars, Every shining time, and How it feels to be, are brilliant. But they are ruined by 100 million, Two Promises, and Roses in Water. I expected this to be their best album (after hearing Jeremy's solo album, which is a must buy) but it just turns out to studio, which means not that much emotion. Sure Jeremy is screaming, but there is nothing in his scream. Maybe Nate was more important than they'll admit. The emo is only slightly there and that is what they are EMO! Not alt-rock. Don't start with this one. Buy Diary, and hear what one of the most promising bands of all time used to sound like. Maybe they shouldn't have gotten back together."
2,A great disappointment,"A am a huge SDRE fan, but to tell you the truth their new CD wasn't all that good, their old stuff was way better. SDRE has lost their style and emotion. This CD isn't worth buying."
1,Terrible,"This album was a huge disappointment for me. Buy diary. The songs on 'this is how it feels...' make me think that sunny day has lost it for good. i cant't remember hearing such a bad album from such a good band. try listening to ""Mogwai"" if you like sunny day."
5,Still Gives Me Chills,"I can't believe it's been 13 years since I first heard this CD. Funny thing is I listened for 3 or 4 years before I actually listened to the lyrics too.Another KOD reviewer on Amazon had problem with some of the gay-themed lyrics. If you can't get over that, then frankly you don't deserve to hear it. The guitar effects will put you in a trance, and the songs flow together seamlessly. One of the reasons KOD didn't have mainstream success is their songs are some heavy duty songs about LOVE, both gutwrentching, and glorious.One of the top 10 CD's that changed my life.Just buy it."
5,Another great album from Twilightning,"This is one of my all-time favorite bands. This album is rather heavy on the synthesizer sounds when compared to their others, which is actually not a quality attribute to my ear, but they pull it off with flying colors. Highly recommended to anyone who likes metal with powerful vocals...EdGuy, Excalion, Iron Maiden, etc."
5,Good play,I read this because my husband had to buy it for a college course and it was actually a really good play to read :) The only part I hate about reading plays is keeping who says what straight!
4,"It was great to read, yet too short!","This is the first play I've read by Anton Chekhov and I am very interested in Russian culture, so it was good play to read about the fall of the Russian aristocracy. However, I don't think the characters are as fully developed as they could have been. Nonetheless, I truly enjoyed reading this play and hopefully some day I can watch it on stage!"
2,Something had stabbed through the book,"The packaging allowed something to stab through thepaper of the book and ruin the bottom of two pages. I repaired it with tape, but itcould not be used by anyone but me. I will keep it however."
1,Chekov's Play is like a Half-Eaten Apple...,"Although Chekov's play accurately reflects the decline of Aristocratic power in 19th century Russia, it is unfulfilling. Mdm. Ranevskaya's Orchard is bought under her feet by a ""friend"" whose hunger for profit motivated his friendship with her. So this is the transformative moment: Mdm. Ranevskaya loses her most cherished possession, and then what? Her friend, Lopahin, feins innocense, Mdm. Ranevskaya runs off to Paris to whom or what? We never find out. It's sort of like biting into a pretty good apple only to have it fall on the ground."
3,Poor Delivery,"The item itself was in great condition. However, the package got lost in the mail so they shipped me another copy, which I received. I was grateful for this, but I really needed the book early on and had to wait almost a month to receive a copy."
1,Reading this book was a mistake,"Reading this book, though it was very short, was an incredibly large waste of time! It was confusing, badly written and pointless. Reading a book where the plot is hidden in choppy sentences and weird Russian words contributed to my dislike of this book. Take my advice, if you are going to read this book dont read it before bed or you will most definatly fall asleep!"
1,A dreadful play.,"""The Cherry Orchard"" is an atrocious play. If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards. Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s). For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make. The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are. I do not recommend."
1,Very poor book,"This book lost all credibility when I read the authors' attack on fundamentalism. I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased. The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is ""borders on idolatry,"" that fundamentalists are ""often parasitic"" and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to ""other approaches."" Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having ""a totally closed world view,"" and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was. The title would more accurately be, _A Liberal Christian Response to Philosophy_, instead of the current title."
2,A little disappointing,A whole bunch of commercials and a couple articles and even less pictures worth looking at.
3,A Bit Pricey,"I was a tad disapointed; just because of the price to be honest. I ordered the cd as a Christmas gift for someone and it was delivered very promptly (i received it 6 days before the estimated time!!) and in great condition; so i was very pleased with that. However, the cd itself, i think is a bit expensive for what it is. I was expecting a set or something for the price i paid (+ shipping charges) for this product. When it was delivered and i opened the box; there was one little cd in there..!? The music is good and it is my fault for not reading the desription better as to what it was. If i were to do it over, no way I would spend that much for one cd."
1,I am being gererous giving this one star!!,"What you have here it the single most worst cd ever made.How someone thought it was a good idea to take Hank Sr.'s low-fi mono recordings, peel off his voice and put it in modern, digital stereo surrounding is beyond me.Imagine Hank Jr. singing a line, then a great guitar solo, then Hank III taking a vocal turn, then a guitar solo, then Hank Sr. coming in with vocals that seem to come off an lp that was found lying in the gravel somewhere at a flea market.It is beyond bad. Not a good idea, and nothing like ""There's a Tear in My Beer."""
2,Uninspired,"I picked this up back in '98 after seeing Hank III for the first time. Perhaps for the Hank Jr. fans it is worth your time but for me a Hank Sr. & Hank III fan it is disappointing. I'm aware of the family lineage but I don't need to hear this blend of voices to appreciate the songwriting talent of Hank Williams.I did talk to Hank III about this recording and it sounded like his dad's idea not his. Out of the dozens of recordings of all three of the artists, this is my least favorite for all of them."
5,"Three Hanks ""Men with Broken Hearts"" - Hank Sr., Hank Jr., and Hank III CD","EXCELLENT!!! The way they compiled these 3 great voices together is a miracle!!! The sound is simply ""awesome"". One Hank will sing a part, then another Hank will sing another part, and so on. These are re-mixed upbeat Rock versions of these Hank William's Classics. This cd contains the classic ""Men with Broken Hearts"" - everyone should hear this song before they die. This is simply a poetic masterpiece, and this 3 Hank's version is ""awesome"". This is ""required"" listening for any Hank fan!!! I've seen Hank Jr. perform live and he is great. Thanks and may God Bless!!!"
2,wrong sizes,"I love legos, but his was a little disappointing. The roof tiles are wider than the ""normal"" lego tiles that come with other kits, so you can't combine the sets. The reason I got this set was to create bigger houses, but I still can't since the tiles don't match my other tiles. Not sure why. As for the windows and doors, they are great."
5,Jane is a girl with spunk!,"My daughter Sadie and I love this book. The author has a real knack for writing with the voice of a young girl. This girl, Jane, is smart and funny and spunky. It's a great story!"
4,Jesus Is Coming,This is a well written book. Truly it is for the true believer in CHRIST.One that is interested in the Coming of the LORD in these last days.
4,Fox and war,"A wonderful DVD, the beginning was a little droll but the movie picked up considerably in the middle. The language is rough, the graphics can get gory, but altogether it is a heartbreaking film. Vietnam at its worst.Michael J. Fox played his part,(as always) to the max, and Sean Penn was not far behind for the evil and crazy leader of the band.Altogether, it's a movie anyone should watch. If not for the truth and final showdown between Fox, and his enemies, but for the wonderful acting and storyline."
3,The most brutal...,"If you wanna watch this film you beter think about it first. It has lots of violence and disturbing scenes wich may not be suitable for younger viewrs.I can say that clearly,my mom hates this film because of the strong rape scenes and the high profanity in this film.Well i like this film because of the war,but if you want action packed don't buy this one,it lacks of good action. Another thing it might be boring watching this movie twice."
2,This movie is a disservice to Vietnam vets.,"In 1967 and 1968, I was squad leader in Vietnam in the 25th Infantry Division. This is yet another Hollywood movie that portrays Vietnam combat vets as perverts, and heartless killers. Nothing could be farther from the truth. War is brutal and ugly and the Vietnam War was no exception, but young Americans served honorably in Vietnam as Americans have in other wars. Yes, these things may have happened, but they were the exception and not the rule. It seems that most of the movies I've seen focus on the same negative themes. If you REALLY want to know what the war was like, the only DVD I could fully recommend is ""Dear America, Letters Home from Vietnam"". This DVD contains actual Vietnam War footage, which is mixed with letters home read by Tom Berenger, Robin Williams, Robert Deniro, Michael J. Fox, Martin Sheen and many others. Please see this video if you really want to begin to understand what combat vets experienced and how they conducted themselves."
5,"""Casualties of War"" is a Masterpiece","This is the best war movie ever made. ""Casualties of War"" is an amazing accomplishment by director Brian De Palma. The story of a soldier (Michael J. Fox) who reports his squad for the rape and murder of a Vietnamese woman during Vietnam. He lives in fear and is assumed the enemy for not participating in the heinous acts. The squad leader (Sean Penn) has no moral conscious and his ego gets the best of him. Ving Rhames gave a speech about justice and was extremely right on. You can't beat the system, but when it's to do the right thing, then you must try."
1,horrible. save your money,"This the the absolute worst war movie ever made. It is full of HORRIBLE acting (Sean Penn is no Tom Berringer in Platoon!). The film is full of geographical inaccuracies (a train on the side of a mountain in Vietnam???). Trust me, save your money. This is blatantly an anti-war movie and has no purpose other than for some hollywood celebrity pundits trying to make soldiers look like criminals."
1,A pity of a mess.,"Bian De Palma makesthe mistake of hiscareer by doing twothings. Making a judgement on a warhe doesnt understandand by counting onMichael J Fox to carry the film.Its such a whiney mess of a film that I use it to annoy my wife when she asks whats on television.Its actually that bad. Sean Penns acting in this film will go down in history as one of the great and mighty pieces of overacting and caricature. It will be used in acting classes for yrs to come as an example of how to butcher a part beyond recognition.I have read the reviews for this film and am astounded that one single positive review was written.A biased,lousy mess that will be forgotten. Look at what its selling for used and you will see for yourself."
1,It Sucked,This movie stinks. It was so bad that I hope I never have to watch it again for the rest of my life.
2,Terrible movie,Totally unbelievable and bad in all respects. Really worthless. Only reason I give it two stars is because the [Vietnamese girl]is not bad to look at when they first abduct her.
4,The Rest of the Story,"I know the soldier on whom the character of Sven was based, and the incident portrayed in the movie impacted his life in a major way. Due to death threats from the comrades he turned in for their crimes, he and his wife decided not to have children. At the time, they felt that the risk to their own lives and any family they might start were too great. Fortunately, nothing ever came of the threats, even after the rapists/murderers got out of prison. But this gentle, compassionate, loving couple was kept from having a family due to the shadow on their lives.American servicemen are just as guilty of such atrocities today. We've already seen stories of how they rape their own female comrades in Iraq and Afghanistan. No wonder the people whose countries we occupy hate the ""Ugly Americans."""
4,Land of Confusion,"Interesting film set in Vietnam brings up the whole issue of morality in war. Can morality exist in war? Is there such an animal? In such a graphic film depicting death, carnage and rape where does one draw the line? Penn is excellent as usual but Fox probably cast for his mere presence, as a character of virtue may be the real casualty here that diminishes the impact of the director's intentions. This film contains one of Ennio Morricone's best latter scores."
3,Flawed...but worth the watch,"I give credit to De Palma, because I doubt anyone could do a movie based on the same material any better. I don't know how fast the film was made, but the visuals seem to suggest to me that it was thrown quickly together. The actors are all believable, but not even Fox is all that likable. Penn is good as always, and Fox makes you sympathize for him. But there is something about this film that is missing,it's not as effective as it could've been. Ving Rhames does well, watch for him in a smaller role as Fox's commanding officer."
5,A cinematic opera. Absolutely brilliant,"An enduring statement about the conflicts that exist between morality and circumstance, character and expediancy, steadfastness and complacency, and the war that each of us has to fight for ourselves in our own minds during times of trouble.Great performances from Penn (as usual) and a very (unexpectedly) believable Michael J Fox.The real question is what and who are the real Casualties of war? Not to be missed."
5,it's the world's best acquired taste!,"Okay, to first start out, if you aren't into this sort of genre of music (or if you aren't vaguely familiar with the epic saga that is Xenogears), then you might want to consider other options before buying this piece. Packed with a ton of the music from the game, the CD's recording quality is enough to give RPGers that warm, fuzzy feeling of nostalgia all over again. Everything from Lahan to id is in this package, and it's well worth the somewhat high price. A wonderful compliment to possibly the greatest game out there."
2,Save your Money,"NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL! there are four discs, the only useful one is the first disc. it starts out by teaching you basic vocab...how to say bathroom, silverware, fruits, food items, how to tell time, colors, numbers and stuff like that. but then u put in the second disc and its speaking ENTIRELY in Japanese and it's impossible to understand whats going on or what youre supposed to do by just what you learned on the first disc. also there are interactive games to help u learn and remember, but the games are easy and repetitive and get boring fast! Not a good tool for learning Japanese...disappointing =("
1,Terrible.,"Your money would be better spent on a book that teaches you grammar AND vocabulary. This set comes with no directions, just a bunch of CDs in a box. Using the software isnt explained, the games are useless as you can win just by clicking all over, you dont have to learn anything.Learning phrases isnt helpful for any language if you dont know how to take vocabulary and form your own phrases.Honestly this is a waste of cash. Get a book. If you need pronunciation help buy a book with an audio disc included."
1,Terrible dub! Completely different from original series.,"This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton."
3,Blow your top,"We bought this carafe less than a year ago. Looks great, feels good, does not keep coffee hot for very long. Recently, it started blowing the top off when the hot coffee pressurized the air inside. This happened three times and we just popped it back on.This morning I heard an explosion and found that the top, which is attached to the handle, was blown completely from the carafe and coffee was everythere. It virtually exploded from the hot gases inside. The tiny screw which holds the handle to the carafe was snapped right off. Had I been standing there, I could have been burned or hurt by the projectile, which I found over in the sink. I wrote to the manufacturer and am waiting for a response. Beware....."
1,TOO MUCH PRESSURE,I received one of these carafes for fathers day last year. After filling every first time you push the button to pour coffee..it pops and blows coffee all over. I have found I have to hold a paper towel over the top to keep everything dry! I have had bad luck with other Oggi coffee carafes too.
1,Don't Waste Your Money on Oggi Coffee Carafes!,"This carafe doesn't not keep the coffee hot or even warm for that matter more than an hour or so, and that is only when you preheat it and fill it full of coffee. Otherwise, you will have cold coffee in no time. It is impossible to keep clean even with a bottle brush. It's stainless steel but the bottom is rusting (on the outside) and although its only 3-4 months old the lever in the lid has broken for no apparent reason. Move on to some other brand like Correlle. This one is a wast of money."
3,"Good, but not good enough.","I am probably Nobuo Uematsu's biggest fan. I own and love every single one of his CDs. FF VII: Reunion Tracks is hardly what I'd call an arrangement album! It has just a mere 3 tracks on it that are arranged!!! a big disappointment for any fan of the music from FF VII. Although these 3 tracks are astoundingly beautiful, it is still not enough to pay out the money that this CD costs! the rest of the tracks on this are great, but they are all taken from the FFVII OST. if you are a FF music fanatic - then buy this CD. but if you are simply looking for good FF music and expect alot - buy the FFVII OST. you will be getting alot more for your money. If you want a FF arrangement album that is OUT OF THIS WORLD and will simply BLOW YOU AWAY - then take my advice and buy the FFVIII: FITHOS LUSEC VECOS VENOSEC album!"
1,"Swimming against the tide, but...","An improvisation is wonderful, if, and this is a huge if, an improvement on the original is made. After listening to all 15 cuts I have to say that in every case the original is more enjoyable and satisfying to me to listen to. Can you really expect Montero to improve on Vivaldi? That really is too much. However if it is not as enjoyable as the Vivaldi, why would I spend money to listen to Montero? This revue is in no way a reflection on her pianistic abilities, but it sure is a gripe about butchering classic source material.My advice, and it seems to be unique among reviewers so far, is that if you like Vivaldi, listen to Vivaldi, not Montero seeking to change Vivaldi. Or Bach. Or Scarlatti. Or Pachebel...The original is stunning...the alterations to it are just misc. music."
1,Not at all what I expected!,This book seems just a vehicle to vent the author's bitterness and is a very poor representation of the experience of Catholic schooling and upbringing. I am saddened to think readers may think it is. It is neither humorous nor entertaining. I read it cover to cover looking for merit and found none. I have to give it a poor rating.
5,Quick Success to Stain Glass,I am a beginner and I'm teaching myself. This book was very helpful in teaching me how to begin. It also has a lot of nice designs that I was not afraid to try. I found this book very helpful in getting started.
5,Have book will travel!,Love this book! It is always in the car and always helpful. Nice write-ups about the different parks and places to walk. If you like to run around with your dog do buy one of these and leave it in the car.
4,Great music to listen to when driving or relaxing,"Just from hearing excerts from the first five songs has convinced me to purchase the CD. I wasn't thrilled with Zurg's Planet; but I liked the rest. If the rest of the songs were as good as the first four - you've got a winner. But, this type of music can be listen to when taking long drives; driving through traffic; or just for your kids to relax to. Well, maybe not. My kids are older, 19 & 21, they will listen while driving, if they were smaller they probably would act out the scenes.Thanks for the sample. Can't wait for the CD!"
2,not for the kids...,I was excited with the release of the new movie but very disappointed with the soundtrack CD. Keeping the kids attention beyond the 3rd track just doesn't cut it. I like the instrumental tracks personally but this should have cut and released as CD-Single containing the 3 voice selections.
3,A decent americana Soundtrack,"Toy Story 2 is one of the greatest animated movies which has a treat for everbody. The soundtrack is definetly for americana lovers. Though different in spots, the soundtrack struggles with variety. The opening ""Zurg's Planet"" track is very different from other tracks such as ""Jessie and The Roundup Gang"" and ""The Cleaner"". But that's just the score. The beautiful ""When She Loved Me"" is a delight for those of the melancholy group. And the new big band version of ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" is highly enjoyable. I did not know how well squeak-toy penguins could sing. Well anyway, a good addition to your movie soundtrack collection."
3,O.K.,I was really expecting something from this cd. The first three or four songs are pretty good but the rest are just musical songs. If you want some music check out Tarzan.
3,"A heart-warming, funny movie!","The Village Barbershop is a nice surprise. A heartwarming mix of loneliness with humor, this film takes place in old Reno. A barber who feels he has lost everything comes in contact with a young woman who has never had much of anything. She is full of spunk and determination, however, and eventually the barber gives in to her ideas for his dying barbershop. Hilarious scenes with the barber's college age renters next door. The unusual friendship that develops between the barber and the young woman brings each of them to better lives. The writer, director and producer, Chris Ford, has a winner with his first movie. See it!"
4,A Charmer!,This is a charming film. Funny and touching. The cast brings a real depth to the characters and situation. You'll laugh at the bad guys and wish you could know the good guys. John Ratzenberger gives an award worthy performance.
4,Just what I was looking for,"I saw a preview of this movie(from Local Color - another winner) and just identified with a couple of the characters and knew I had to see it. It was funny, poignant and something I really connected with and yet it offered a balance. What I mean is that it wasn't overdone in any one area......the relationships unfolded and I felt like I knew most of them. This is the kind of movie that I know I want to see more of and what I'd really love is the soundtrack. The music in the movie was great. Keep on bringing us quality movies like this. Thank you."
5,"""The Village Barbershop"" Movie","A wonderful, ""feel good"" movie......funny, poignant, delicious. John Ratzenberger shows how multi-faceted his acting abilities are. He's funny, sweet, sexy, lovable. This movie is a ""must-see""!"
2,Disappointing...at best ...,"Ive given this recording a few listens.. And, For some reason..it sounded better when i reviewed the tracks on line..than when i gave the entire CD a listen..The Production, isn't that good, & The Lyrics are Kinda Pointlessly PREACHY..I am a Big Fan of both Watson, and Turner, BUT..there is a LOT to be desired on this recording..."
1,spirit of christmas,i was not able to purchase because of mistake in pricing and advertisinig. may try later. the company contacted to advise of this mistake.
3,See Michael Chabon,"There's a great review of this book at Michael Chabon's website. You can get to it by googling for ""Yiddish phrasebook""."
4,Is the Pope Catholic?,"The Third Secret is a timely piece of fiction by Steve Berry. The book is about alleged appearances by the Virgin Mary throughout the last 100 years. Father Colin Michener, the Papal Secretary, is brought into a potential conspiracy by his mentor, Pope Clement. We find that there has been a conspiracy by past Popes to cover up a part of ""The Third"" Secret"", which is part of a Marian appearance. This secret part would allegedly contradict present church doctrine.This is a nice work of fiction, based on a good bit of truth. If you like Dan Brown, you will enjoy this book."
2,Sigh,"I wish the Catholic bashing would stop; perhaps a way to do so would be a real 3rd secret. I finished this book just because I took it as total fantasy. If you put aside all the preconceptions about doctrine, Catholic history, etc., and are willing to just go for a ride without expecting the thing to make ""Catholic sense,"" the book can actually be rather enjoying in its plot. Of course, the actual 3rd secret (which has been revealed by everyone reviewing the book here) is ludicrous, but entertaining if you can set aside everything else. So it's what you expect; a Steve Berry novel, which has its own universe. You should expect to get what you know you are buying from this author, nothing more."
3,The Third Secret,"I thought this book was great until it disclosed the Third Secret.It had Suspense,Mystery and Romance,but the ending was Lame!The Author could have used more creativity here."
1,"A disappointment and, in the end, a waste of time","I kept reading past the midpoint of the book, hoping that this was not going to be another liberal-inspired jab at the Catholic church. But, as the end wore on, sure enough all of the liberal jargon found its way in to the final chapters, pro-choice, homosexuality is OK, female priests, married priests. This is suppose to be a novel, but I hate to see an author play fast and loose with factual history to satisfy a political motive. This book is a waste of time. My first Steve Berry read, and my last."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is rife with misconceptions about the Catholic Church and is a disappointing read for anyone with even the slightest understanding of marian apparitions. The suspense builds until finally, near the end of the book, the missing portion of the ""third secret of Fatima"" is revealed. The problem is that the missing portion of the secret is preposterous and unbelievable, making the climax of the book a disappointment.I am surprised that best-selling author Steve Berry would produce a book that is so poorly researched. He has lost credibility with me and I will never read another of his books.Beyond betraying the author's ignorance of the Catholic Church, the book was poorly edited and had many typos. At one point, the name of even one of the main characters was misspelled!While many would find the book's suspense compelling, I thought reading it was a waste of time."
1,Couldn't Finish It...,"I began reading Steve Berry's books in order. The first two were fine. The Third Secret was just absurd. I got almost to the end and just gave up. Very rarely will I not finish a book once I get into it. I can overlook some implausability and use my imagination when reading, but this was just too far. I thought Dan Brown's Demons & Angels was pretty farfetched at the end, but The Third Secret is even worse. I am not particularly religious, so it wasn't that I was offended by the book. I stopped reading Mr. Berry's books for quite some time after this book. I finally decided to pick up with his next book, which is much better so far.I recommend this author, in general, for some light, entertaining reading, but skip this installment."
3,What a disappointing Secret,"This is the third suspense novel published by Steve Berry that I am aware of. It is a good 'beach read', however his ""secret"" is so disappointing. You will have to read it yourself to discover what clever is not.I have read the previous two novels published and have his fourth novel on the bedstand to read soon.So far, I still the the Amber Room best."
3,Of all things to reveal...,"An interesting read and did keep me going until the secret was revealed and the way the main characters reacted throughout.* spoilers *I have two main issues with the plot:1. If this really is a revelation from God via Mary, why of all things would He choose to reveal these things? Why not a global push towards clarifying religion?2. Since the revelations were so anti-Catholic in the current sense, why wouldn't the main characters think it might be a deception from the devil himself? I mean just because an apparition says she's Mary, you have to believe she's Mary? What happened to faith and why is it necessary to have a sign? If there were obvious signs all the time, we wouldn't need faith.The book had so much potential, but I think Berry blew it in the end."
3,So-So Fatima Fiction,"Although an intriguing tale, the author fails to acknowledge that Our Lady's message is one of love and repetence and then substitutes tolerance of sin. Berry's characters are interesting but he takes too many liberties for my liking. A good read but as far as Fatima fiction, I place this book far below Windswept House and Secret of Fatima."
2,I'm weary of Berry's re-writes of Christianity,"I've now read all of Berry's books and although I mostly enjoyed the story lines, I progressively grew weary of how Berry re-writes his own version of Christianity into each one. I realize this is fiction, but each story seemed to try harder to change some truths about Christianity. I read The Third Secret last, and finally have decided to stop reading Berry's books. Writing about Mary, the mother of Jesus, visiting the earth and telling us that heaven approves of homosexuality and that abortion is just fine if that's what the mother wants??? I realize that not everyone believes the Bible. But if you do, these two issues are clearly defined as sin. Interesting that in his ""Writer's Note"" at the end of the book, he discusses what is fact and what is fiction...but absolutely fails to mention his own fictional words he put into the mouth of Mary. Decent story until this ficticious third secret is revealed."
3,"Suspenseful, yet disappointing and anti-climactic","I truly enjoyed the suspense and intrigue surrounding the main character's (Colin) search to discover the third secret. I am not sure how ""real"" it is, but the backstabbing and inner workings at the Vatican were fascinating.However, many of the plot devices, such as the Vatican Secretary of State using Colin's ex-lover as a spy, and numerous recording devices around the Vatican (shades of Nixon) just rang false, as if the author was really stretching. I didn't get this feeling when I read the DaVinci code, of which this books seems like a second-grade imitation.Most disappointing is the revelation of the 3rd Secret. This was alluded to in previous reviews, so I won't give it away. Suffice to say, it's highly disappointing and will leave you feeling cheated.Don't buy this book, check it out at the library!"
2,Absurd Plot,"The author is quite talented; the book well written. The religious history very interesting. There is sufficient adventure, intrigue and excitement.But the central theme, that many core beliefs of Catholicism are at odds with the God it purports to serve, that Mary herself has repudiated such beliefs, and that a progressive pope will shortly put an end to these beliefs, is more than a stretch, it devolves into an anti-Catholic message that is wrapped around a good yarn. This is exacerbated by the depiction of high church officials as evil Mafia type figures who readily engage in heinous acts, including murder and extortion. Yes, some church officials have in the past been guilty of deceit and cover ups to protect child abusers, but this is a far cry from high church officials engaging in conduct rivaling that of the characters in ""The Godfather"" series. But if comparing the Catholic church to the evil demonstrated in those movies is your cup to tea, then this book is for you."
4,Far Fetched - Interesting Read,"Typical Steven Berry book - action thriller with a historical/fact base. A quick read that keeps the pages turning. I enjoy these books immensely - but this particular book is a little far fetched for me with heavenly appartitions and such.Having siad that, it is great entertainment, and provides enough interesting historical tidbits that it remains classic Berry and a good read."
4,No spectacular ending here.,"Although a good read, nice build up, a couple of nasty bad guys including a Pope and his side kick who seemed to have been trained in a terrorist camp, the ending was unbelieveable and a quite strained. I just can't imagine the BVM (Blessed Virgin Mary) agreeing with liberals on the issues of today's citizens. Understanding and empathizing with their plight, yes, but that is as far as I would go."
2,Far-fetched,"I enjoyed Berry's two other novels, despite reading reviews which complained that both books were too far-fetched and improbable. I do not mind suspending reality to read a book or to watch a movie, but this book took things a little too far! I am Catholic, and maybe that is why I found Berry's third secret revealed at Fatima and subsequently hidden by the Church too unbelieveable. There were several parts to the secret, and if Berry would have limited its scope, the book would have been more compelling and believeable. The portion of the secret that deals with motherhood is just totally improbable and Berry just goes too far with it. Also, it is too trite that the villian in the novel is always able to figure out the protagonist's next step. This book starts off well, but attempts to accomplish too much, which makes it difficult for the reader to suspend reality and enjoy the story."
2,Big Build-up for Nothing,"If you don't mind the liberal propaganda and the way Berry totally ignores any Scripture that contradicts his agenda, you may enjoy this book. It is a page-turner. However, when the third secret is finally revealed, it is quite anti-climatic after all the build-up it was given. I was expecting something apocolyptic and got the Democratic platform for social policy instead. Conservative Catholics and all Christians who happen to believe the Bible is true will find the book offensive."
5,The best of all his books (all of which I love).,"Sure the ""secret"" is outrageous, but then, the same can be said about organized religion in general, so I didn't have a problem with it. I loved the book and thought it had a great plot and was an entertaining read, which I believe is what it was intended to be - hello - fiction! It wasn't preachy or didactic and therefore, in general, annoying as so many other authors seem to be with this and similar subjects (case in point - The Last Templar by Raymond Khoury, OMG, bleck!!!). Taken for what it is - a good page turner - it's one of Berry's best, in my opinion, and certainly inspired me to read all of his novels (this was the first I read), none of which have disappointed to date."
4,my first berry book..,"pretty good story! i really enjoyed the concept and the books fast pace! looking forward to reading more of the author's works, thumbs up!"
3,3 Stars Is As Good As It Will Get,"As far as modern pop thrillers go, this is ok. Steve Berry has placed himself with the likes of Dan Brown and Tom Clancy. Yes, the books by these are all good, but literature they will never be. Regardless of that, Berry does a great job of building suspense and delivering the goods. My problem, ****Potential Spoiler**** the ending. Without completely giving it away, I found it uninspired, unimaginative, and just plain disappointing. To his credit, I should have seen it coming, telegraphed throughout the novel as it was. Still, with these kind of books, I typically walk away like I do from a ""good"" movie. This wasn't the case here.Aside from all of that, if you like the typical Catholic conspiracy and evil Cardinals, then you will like this. It appears to me, not being Catholic, that more conspiracies are dreamt up within the church then there are George Bush's presidency."
4,"Weak Ending, but I would recommend this book.","It was a good read. Weak ending. I've read worst. His other two books had better endings, however, up until the end it was good. The history lesson was useful. I would buy this book again. Now that I think about it I did buy this next one ""the Templar Legacy"" so what does that tell you."
1,I wish I could give this book a negative 5 star review.,Ready for the THIRD SECRET? . . . . wait for it . . . . SPOILER ALERT!!!!here it is--GOD IS SICK OF THE CHURCH'S OPPOSITION TO HOMOSEXUALITY AND ABORTION (Among other things).
2,Ugh,"To preface: I am not religious and I am politically liberal. This book was terrible! The beginning was up to par with all the rest of the novels you can pick up at the grocery store, which warrants a couple of stars, but the ending was terrible! The third secret was just a bunch of the author's political views shoved into the mouth of the Virgin Mary. I was disappointed that I read three-quarters of a book's worth of build-up only to have such a ridiculous climax."
1,A disapointing stumble,"I had looked forward to this book, as I enjoyed ""The Romanov Prophecy"" as a fun summer read. Unfortunately, Berry's allowed his religious and social views to turn his latest book into a screed. The hero's antagonist is a cardinal that believes in priestly celibacy and other traditional Catholic dogma, which makes him not merely wrong-headed but a scheming, blackmailing, cartoon villain who does everything but twirl his mustache as he ties the heroine to railroad tracks. The ""secret"" that Barry's concocted is intended to be ""provocative"" in the model of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but instead the revelation manages to be both hilarious and (there's no other word for it) blasphemous at once. Save your time and your money."
3,"Good writing, not very believable...","Not bad writing, and the plot itself was interesting, however I find Mr. Berry has problems with his characterization. And a serious dislike for the Catholic Church, but that's not for this review.His female leads often start out strong, but then turn one-dimension and flat, contributing nothing to the story save another name. I noticed this in 'The Romanov Prophecy' as well, that his villains seem to be omnipotent. They know things just because and use that knowledge to VERY conveniently to foil whatever the hero is trying to accomplish.Specific to this story, Colin Michener seems more than a little nave and foolish, and I'm not sure how he managed to live, let alone uncover this Third Secret. As to the secret, itself, I found it unbelievable. Again, the suspense was good, but the secret? No."
2,Scandelous and Preposterous!!!!!!,"And I am a recovering Catholic now Episcopalian! Also,a registered Democrat with moderate to liberal views!Part of the argument we on the religous ""left"" as it were have with those on the far religous ""right"" is that they seem to want everything clearly outlined and defined. Like taking the bible verbatim. With the exception of the ten comandments when was anything said in the Bible or by Jesus as clear as a bell??????That is we, on the left think the Bible was divine inspiration not divine dictation. There is just no way the Mother of God would clearly say all the things the 3rd secret is suppose to reveal and so clearly in the syntax of the day now in the 21st century!!!!!It was an interesting point that the author had Clement be a pope of German birth and the book was probably started long before Benedict's election. The stuff on St. malachy's predictions was interesting too althought probably a fraud."
2,Wrong Hero,"This book was, according to various sources, written in 1999, so it is hardly intruding on Brown territory esp in regard to the book Angels and Demons, which also deals with the election of a Pope. Compared to the Brown books its lowkey version of events makes it actually rather effective. Unfortunately it ends up making the same mistake as the Brown book, its villains turn out more worthy of sympathy than its heroes. In particular the Cardinal Alberto Valendrea, who Barry is determined to paint as such a scoundrel, won my admiration far more than the unhappy Colin Mitchner and his colorless girlfriend. Both the Father and the Cardinal are contesting over the content of the lost Third Secret of Fatima, which in this reviewer's opinion might as well have stayed lost. The book's a good airport read, but there's little of serious import about it."
4,Good Suspenseful Novel,"Let me begin by saying this novel is in no way similar to the DaVinci Code as teased on the cover. However, it is a good suspenseful story that made it hard for me to put down. Although fictional, the story is built around a number of true facts. I enjoyed the author's very visual descriptions of locale and scenery. I also liked the characters. However, I did find Ambrosi a little hard to believe that he could have elevated to such a high position in the church, but this is fiction. The writing has me interested in reading other works by this author."
3,Just some simple problems,"I really DID enjoy this book, but there were a few problems that left me shaking my head. The death at the end of the book was completely unnecessary. I would have liked to see a plot twist at that point and hell...I don't know...fake him out with some tic-tac's or mentos.The story is pretty basic: the evil church leaders...but I had trouble feeling anything for these charecters. Maybe a littel more development is necessary.I DO NOT agree with the reviewers that hammer this book because of it's message. The dogma created by the church is the whole reason that such a message IS plausable.Took me a few hours to knock this one off and it's a ""pass arounder"" for my circle of friends.I just hope the next book is better."
2,Almost.........lost it in the end,"Held my attention for an airplane ride (hence 2 stars), but I was sincerely disappointed for the last third. Kept reading because I didn't think any author would be that brazen. Trivializes current political / social / religous arguments to an insulting degree."
2,The Ending,"The book was suspenceful throughout and I enjoyed it so much that I could not wait to get back to it, but the ending was less than satisfying and boardered on ""corny""."
4,The Third Secrert,"This is a well written book that deals with the operation and politics of the Catholic Church, and specifically the Vatican."
5,third secret,"Steve Berry has become one of my favourite authors. The Third Secret does not disappoint, Get ready for a thrilling ride."
4,Intriguing and Suspenseful,"I read this book in two days and loved it. What is the Third Secret of Fatima and why did it take the Church so long to release it? While this is a fiction novel it poses some very intriguing questions about religion, faith and what we are told to believe. Great book for conspiracy theorists, the curious and the faithful."
2,Good but frustrating,"This book deals with the ever fascinating subject of prophesies, the vatican church, and corrupt officials. The book does not have a good grip on the suspense it tries to create, but actually aggravates the reader, and frustrates him. The plot is different from the usual 'Da Vinci Code' type books, but it could have been handled much more efficiently. In all, this book is good for reading, but is definitely not a keeper."
2,Intriguing but EXTREMELY disappointing.,"The Third Secret follows the typical suspense/thriller model. It is adequately interesting to keep one reading. The early pages filled with interesting bits of information about the Vatican's history. However, (And I won't give away the secret) at about page 350, the book takes a dive. Steve Berry apparently thinks that no one will object when he shoves in his personal views on divisive church issues. But whether you agree with him or not, the revelation is completely unwarranted. I suppose Berry was trying to set his religious thriller in the same vein as Dan Brown's ""heretical"" books. In the end the book devolves into a treastise of Berry's personal views, presented in a way that debate is impossible. That added to the absolutely deplorable behavior by the story's protagonists (which Berry makes no attempt to challenge) makes this book a disappointing read at best."
2,offensive to Christians,"Each to his own taste, but I wish I'd read some of the negative reviews here before I wasted time and money on this book. The only ""secret"" revealed in this book is the author's personal, overt political pro abortion and gay marriage agenda. Seriously, if you are a Christian, do yourself a favor and just skip this ridiculous attempt to make fun of your Christian beliefs."
3,Not Berry's best... save your time,"Of all of the Steve Berry novels, this one happens to be the slowest one he's written. It's also, in my opinion, the worst book he's written.While Berry is always detail orientated, here he just gets bogged down in details. Further, he never really seems to get to the point. The ""climax"" of the book is really more of a stifled yawn.I have a firm policy about reading a book all the way through... however this time, I almost didn't make it. Too few details, too many threats, too many political ""intrigues"" without the excitement to back them up & not enough of Berry's famous nail biting, adventure with death right on the hero & heroines tale.Avoid this one... it's just not that good."
4,Nice Read,"This is the second Steve Berry novel I have read, and this was certainly better than the Amber Room. The plot is intriguing and the story held my interest through the end of the novel.The downside to this novel is that the Third Secret isn't all that shocking, and for the second straight novel, there's a five letter word to describe the personality of the lead female character. Is Berry a misogynist or was he going through a divorce while drafting these novels?Also, the antagonists are almost cartoonish. How or why did these individuals become priests in the first place?"
1,"The ""Politically-Correct"" Secret","I truly enjoyed a good portion of this book. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to find out what the Third Secret was. But, I was so disappointed. The secret revealed by the Virgin turns out to be liberal, politically-correct nonsense. I could barely finish the book."
2,You have got to be kidding,"The book was pretty well written, but is typical in that the conservatives are the evil ones and the liberals are the good guys. How tiresome that plotline is!! But the unforgivable sin is the third secret. It is just plain stupid. Any one who knows anything about Catholicism will just laugh off the third secret. It is just wishful thinking by people who want their Catholicism in the cafeteria style. I stopped reading it after that."
2,A bit unbelievable,This book targets some very political issues right at the heart of the Catholic church and then (here's the unbelievable part) one of the Cardinals engages one of the priests to kill other priests to maintain the status quo and ultimately become pope. I'm not Catholic but I just don't think the premise of the book or the actions of the characters were believable.
4,Very entertaining,This is the first of Steve Berry's books that I've read. I liked it so much that I bought all the novels by him that I could lay my hands on (from my favorite local used books store). It is action packed and well researched. I admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched. His depiction of the Vatican's intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though (except perhaps for the murder parts). It is the kind of novel that I find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation.
3,The Secret would start WWIII,"I enjoyed the read, but the secret was really out there. I tried to imagine this much intrigue in the Vatican and that was probably the most amusing of all."
2,"""Truth""","The characters in Berry's novel seem to be computer generated, as does the story itself. Once again, the evil Catholic Church has hidden the ""truth"" from a blind & stupid laity, who must be recued by the liberal elite. Those priests, bishops & nuns who have failed to live up to their vows due to their exclusive knowledge of what ""Truth"" is, i.e. ""situational"".Berry quotes extensively from scripture in this piece of work. He even quotes a scripture that makes his whole story just plain silly. ""What you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven & what you bind on earth, will be bound in heaven."" Guess he overlooked that one because, after all, most of us loyal to the Church, are too dumb & blind to ""catch it"". I'm an old woman now, so I'll just stick to my ongoing conversations with Jesus through the Eucharist, the rosary, & just plain ""listening"". By the way Steve, Jesus loves you...but, He's not too fond of the way you presented His Mother.Kathleen RineyTroy, Tx."
2,A Let Down To Be Sure.,"Although The Third Secret is the first and only book I have bought and/or read from Steve Berry, I was not impressed. The first two thirds of the book was written well. The book bviously puts the Catholic church in a very bad light. The mysterious untold portion of the third secret (which is what keeps you reading the book) was so bizaar and completely rediculous that it blew away any semblance of believability that the reader may have had up to that point. What a severe let down. Fiction of this type has to retain some trace of believablity even to the end. I can not recommend this book."
1,Painful!,"Painfully, painfully, painfully bad! At first it's just the bad writing and the stock cardboard characters. If you're looking for psychological nuance or complexity, don't open this book. Thank God the author spared us the love scenes! But by the time the secrets are revealed, the book has descended into a comic awfulness reserved for only the greatest bad books. I was writhing and groaning on my couch. If your book club is used to reading good books, have them read this one sometime, and then sit around like the guys in Mystery Science Theater and have a great time poking fun at it. But hey, it was a best seller! Says a lot about us doesn't it?!"
2,Sorry,"I wanted to like this book but just couldn't. It was close but too slow, too predicatable and certainly no thriller. Somewhat interesting twist on the ""secret"" but not enough to recommend it as a must read."
4,"A page turner, if you keep an open mind about religion","The author brings the the characters into focus and makes us care about them, or detest them. I don't have much interest in Fatima or the other appearances by Mary, but that is not necessary to enjoy a well researched drama about the oldest continuing institution in history: The Catholic church. The author has linked together events in church history to give a modern view of the Vatican and the modern struggles within the church and within our society. I'm not Catholic, but the book gives on an appraciation for the Vatican and what it means to billions of people."
3,Interesting yet faulty,"Another Vatican is bad fast paced suspense novel. Well written and certainly fairly well researched. My only ""complaint"" as it were is that with all the wonderful research Mr. Berry has done, there are things which are certainly highly inaccurate. Among them, and certainly not the least of which, is the burial place of Pope John XXIII. When an author makes such a foolish little mistake, it makes you wonder where else he went wrong."
1,Sacreligious,"I agree with the ""disappointing"" review and would add that the resolution of the mystery could have and should have been without the author's own agenda. To suggest that the Blessed Mother would actually call for murder, suicide, abortion, homosexuality and promiscuity in the priesthood is appalling! I would not reccomend this book to anyone and as I am a full time employee of a county library in an upscale community, I will tell our patrons to pass on this novel."
2,predictable vactican thriller,"while this plot line may have some twists and turns that have a newer spin, this book isn't ""new"" in terms of a fast paced thriller. Mr. Berry does keep the reader engaged, but with so many other books on the market with similiar plot lines centering around the Church, well, one can see the ending before it actually happens. The characters are pretty much stererotypical, the woman hard-boiled woman who has lost her faith and so forth and then the ""love interest"".However, if you need a good read on the plane or while traveling, pick it up!"
2,Doesn't live up to its potential. . .,"The Third Secret is a very good story; unfortunately its written in a mediocre manner. The plot is shallow and poorly developed and at times, obvious. Its more akin to the work of an amateur than a published author. Although Berry seems to have stumbled while penning this work, the editor has badly let the reader down; errors in prose, style and consistency are too numerous to mention.I suggest those who wish to read Berry's work wait for the paperback edition or visit their public library. The Third Secret is a poor waste of hard earned wages."
4,Great religious fiction,"This book is a great read for anyone, but even better with a background in religion. It has great factual basis yet spins a great fiction book that readers will enjoy. <<spoiler>> great timing too due to a new pope taking office, as well as Catholic issues with marriage, children, etc in the news. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Dan Browns books, and would encourage readers to check out Steve Berry's other novels."
1,Borrowed plot + absurd conclusion = Big Disappointment,"Being a big fan of the genre, I had read quite a few of Steve Berry's books and enjoyed them up to this point. But after reading The Third Secret, I will never read another Steve Berry book again.The plot line borrowed significantly from the likes of Dan Brown in his DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons books without providing anything original besides a ludicrous conclusion. When I finally arrived at the conclusion that is so terrible it felt like I got punked by Berry, I physically threw the book down in disgust.I have never read such a terrible book in my life.Goodbye Steve Berry!"
1,Liberal bs,"""Frustrating"" is what another review said and that really hits the nail on the head. The only suspense in the whole book is waiting to see what the third secret is which takes until the very end to find out. Only to find that: 1. Suicide is O.K. 2. Priests can marry. 3. Homosexuality is O.K. 4. Abortion is O.K. So much more could have been done with this book. How many people were disturbed by the fact that the Virgin Mary actually told the pope to kill himself?"
5,really brilliant,this is a brilliant video. I agree its not a replacement for everyday play and excessive tv watching is not good for anyone....but from first hand practical experience my daughter just loves this and has certainly learned practical things from it...we dont put tv on everyday..just every so often...if she is restless or ill.. ( or mommy really needs to get something done....)she much prefers it to anything else that she has seen in the past...in fact it is the only dvd that she gets excited about.it is also a wonderful format to copy and and gives you simple but great ideas for easy play ( good for a new parent)It is was also the only thing that would stop her crying when she was teething... for this i rate it as one of the most valuable things that we have bought!!!!
5,For the small ones,This video is super popular with my 19 month old GD. The rest of us can stand it - it is really really not for older kids/adults.She sees any sort of package to be opened and wants to know if there is a new Eebee in it. Even Barney and Elmo can't beat Eebee for her attention. Not sure how long it will last but will really recommend Eebee for the second year of a child's life. <G>
3,Comprehensive text but full of mistakes,"In general, this book is a good overview of the topics needed to get Six Sigma certification. However, the large number of mistakes and typos are unacceptable. A lot of confusion is created by the poor text editing.Just think about it, the book is printed by ASQ, Quality Press....they should up their quality before we up ours."
1,one sigma handbook,"This book came with six pages of Errata. Even with that, I still found multiple mistakes throughout the book. This book about Six Sigma was written on the one sigma level. I would not recommend this book to anybody. You cannot trust this book!"
5,"Film Noir....in ""Bizarro World""","It was once said that the whole of a movie should not be in so much whether you like or disliked a movie, but rather, did it leave a lasting impression upon you? Taking that idea into account, I would have to say that ""Singapore Sling"" is without a doubt an indelible addition to the film noir genre, albeit the bizarro kind. As one of the reviewers has mentioned before, this movie shouldn't be taken seriously. You should come into this one with an open mind and you'll be rewarded with a beautifully photographed film noir filled with black humor. ""Singapore Sling"" is like the demented cousin of ""Laura"", ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Grey Gardens"". It's your basic detective story but with torture, bizarre erotica, and outstanding overacting. Just make sure the parents are asleep and that you've got the right kind of friend in tow when watching it."
5,IMPORTANT NEWS ABOUT A SAD TOPIC!,"Obviously we live in troubled times. Many are unable to confront the tragic events that recently took place. Others feel it very important that they know what is ahead for all of us. If you are of like mind you will want to read NOSTRADAMUS PREDICTIONS OF WORLD WAR III. It contains a host of material from the seers earlier prophecies right on through to the third anti christ who is said to be living in the Middle East. Does this book have all the answers??? Probably not, but the author does delve into the meaning of Nostradamus words as well as bringing in the visions of other seers from our current era. And, in addition, there are other things besides predictions of World War III to contemplate -- even an invasion from space."
3,Could of been more interesting,"It's an okay read. The beginning chapters are interesting, but later on in the book, it seems like the author had run out of material so they started to talk about aliens and UFOs. There are better books on the topic."
4,WWIII,Another interesting book about Nostradamus and his predictions about WWIII. It is wothwhile reading but believing ??? everything. It is well explained that the verses that Nostradums wrote are matter of interpretation.
1,Misrepresented Item,"We didn't receive this item and called the company to ask why. They said they are no longer making them, but neither the company nor Amazon had bothered to let us know. We did not get a refund as it dragged on and on. I suggest that Amazon discontinue their relationship with parts of the LEGO company. Our grandson was very disappointed as he is a huge LEGO fan. Shame on you, LEGO."
2,Needs more content,I bought this book because my 8 year old daughter wants to be a VET. She actually did enjoy the book but she also finished it in under 10 minutes. There is almost no text in the book it's mostly pictures with a sentence or two at most.This book reads a lot more like a free brochure you pick up a kids fair rather then an $8 book. For what you get I would say this book should be free.
2,"Amusing, worth seeing for free","We were able to see this DVD for free, which is an appropriate price for a silly movie based on the adventures of two stoners. Their goal is to watch THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and start their own business based on an infomercial. They enter rehab to see the TV, get caught up in some other crime, basically wander around. There are one or two very funny scenes, one that I found extremely disturbing and offensive, and a happy, if implausible, ending.If you already have pay channels and it's on, or if someone else offers to lend it to you, it's not a total waste of time, but don't spend money to see it."
5,great,"it was as desceibed. i have nothing else to say, this is very annoying to write this much about the quality of a dvd, stop it."
2,this movie sucks,"Just got done watching it and...yeah, pretty horrible. There were a few moments that made me slightly chuckle, but that's about it for the laughs department. I had a feeling I shouldn't waste my time by the first 5 minutes, but went through with it anyway. I would infinitely recommend Smiley Face over this any day. This movie is just creepy and pathetic in comparison."
5,Molton Brown,I bought this product as a gift for a fussy relative who has everything and is very difficult to please. She loved it! Worth every penny.
3,Taxonomic Classic,"If you're really into taxonomy, this is a must-read. It's a classic work, but some parts were too technical and could be boring for the non-specialist. On the other hand, the various kinds of species were described in detail, with many examples, and the history and hierarchy of the taxonomic science was covered. Basically, I came away from the book with a deeper appreciation for the difficulties involved in naming new (and old) organisms."
4,Good movie of it's times,"Rishi Kapoor was superb in his part, post AAA Rishi tried to get off his childhood chocolate boy image and started looking better and acted brilliantly in this Tariq is okay the heroine is nice Zeenat has a small role Amjad Khan is good as the villain Om Shivpuri is good too"
5,GREAT for Vacation,"I took my GS Service Unit to DC and also our 5th graders over spring break!! To help make the trip ""educational"" as well as fun - this book is like a journal where the students can keep all their tickets, maps, flyers, and information in one little holder. When the parents ask the kids what they saw and did - the kids can pull this out and SHOW the parents and REVIEW what they did!! Excellent visual - up to date - and instead of asking what's this place is about--- there is a short write up about each place they will visit.Also wonderful for families going on vacation ---- the kids love it!"
2,A few minutes of horror,"There's about 15 minutes of horror film. But the rest of the 2 hours is made up of 2 confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy (and the man's brief contact with the dead children). There was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror -- but it didn't strike me as particularly insightful. Instead it was dreary. The acting, even by Jun Ji Hyun, was dreary. The actions by the characters were dreary. The only sign of life comes from the fiancée -- a strong, dynamic performance by attractive Yu Seon.TO see Jun Ji Hyun at her best, I recommendMY SASSY GIRL,DAISY, orIL MARE."
3,Interesting,"The social system of the Technocracy and the way they and other ""sentient"" races interact is quite interesting. Festina is a great character who's more than able of taking care of herself. The fight to get off Melaquin and to keep Jelca from destroying the world is good too. I liked the writing, the pacing, and the way the novel was formatted.However, once extremely irritating facet of this book kept it from being a solid 4-Star: Oar. Snooty, whiney, blithering, Oar took a lot of my enjoyment out of this story. She got under my skin and not in a good way. Her personality was grating. She could have been a much better character."
4,lacking follow through,"Festina & Admiral Chee make a great pair of characters in the start of the book. I wish this sort of duo could have continued longer than it had. The humor which was replaced with this duo wasn't as effective. Melaquin seems like an ideal place to settle if it wasn't for the myth surrounding the place. The follow through of adventure was well done but some of the ideas kind of boring, unadventurous. However, the entire idea of Expendables is hilarious and sad at the same time."
2,two dimensional characters and plot,"This book has a novel premise and that's about it. This might have made a good short story, but as a novel it is completely uninspiring. The characters are all cardboard cutouts who inspire no empathy. The plot consists of one unbelievable deus ex machina turn after another. The contrived mini-chapters with the giveaway titles are annoying. The natives of the planet Melaquin have no depth or ingenuity behind them. Don't bother with this book."
5,Cool Book,"I'm getting tired of wading through these novels where the main antagonist is incredibly annoying, but left in the plot because there'd be no reason to continue writing without him (or her). So you just sit there and get annoyed by the character until the book - mercifully - ends.Expendible is not one of these books. The characters are strange but never annoying. If nothing else, they're human without resorting to extremes. The book reads very quickly and cleanly.You'd be inclined to think it's fluff, since it does read well, but there's actually quite a bit of food for thought in there and some very interesting insight into human nature. Go read it now."
4,An interesting story...,"I've only just gotten back into reading sci-fi books, and I have to say that this was an interesting story. The characters lead a sad life, but of course all is vindicated in the end. The plot took a twist after they landed on ""the planet"" (one that I wasn't expecting, I might add), then it became somewhat political, but I still enjoyed it. I'll more than likely read the other books that are part of the series."
3,Not bad,"It's imaginative and fast-paced, but has some logic problems and never quite grabbed me. It starts off pretty well, but stalls out in the middle.In the final analysis, it's straightforward S.F. that's interesting enough to be worth a look."
3,"That's What ""Expendable"" Means","Like most good SF, this book makes some uncomfortable points about our current society by picking a facet and exaggerating it. How do we see those who are ""different"" or do not meet our standards of physical perfection? In this book, and frankly in contemporary America, those who are distasteful to look at are expendable. This book takes that to the extreme, and wraps it in a powerful and evocative story. Unfortunately, Gardner finds it necessary to sprinkle the tale with miracles and improbabilities that add little to the story or the message. The characters are solid and well-envisioned, and Gardner tells the story elegantly and well, but much of the novel is, um, expendable. Overall, though, a good novel with complex issues; well worth the time it takes to read."
1,disappointing and naive,"Basically I agree with John Clute's assessment of this novel. Mr. Gardner is a fine writer, but has a knack for using really dumb sociobiological explanations. Let us hope he has mulled through consequences when writing COMMITMENT HOUR. He deserves another chance."
2,"Strong beginning, but..","The first few chapters were original in content and writing style. I was intrigued and reading on in hopes of high ""original"" adventure. Alas, the author quickly ran out of his promising creativeness and the book turned into an amalgam of other sci-fi books. It felt like reading Ringworld meshed in with some others. My interest was lost and I skimmed through the latter two thirds of the book without losing much."
5,A STIRRING ADVENTURE AND A MEMORABLE HEROINE,"THIS A STIRRING SF ADVENTURE THAT PITS A MEMORABLEHEROINE, FESTINA RAMPOS AGAINST A STRANGE ANDDEADLY WORLD WHICH SHE IS STRANDED ON. IN THE 25THCENTURY THERE IS NO WAR, CRIME OR POVERTY BUT IFYOU ARE DEFORMED, CRIPPLED YOU ARE PROBABLY AEXPLORER SENT TO DIFFERENT WORLDS AND YOUR LIFEIS NOT WORTH VERY MUCH. THIS NOVEL OF ADVENTUREAND DISCOVERY WAS FASCINATING AND FESTINA WASA HEROINE YOU CAN EASILY ROOT FOR."
4,Nice.,"This book surprised me. For being one of Gardner's first books, its a great one. He tosses around tons of different concepts and ideas with ease. He paints a vivid picture of of a universe in which ""The Technocracy"" regulates lifeform's behavior by eliminating all of the non-sentients. This in it's self makes for some pretty interesting rules. In this story, the main characters must not only deal with these rules, but also bend them. And the way that happens mixes a recipe that isn't your typical sci-fi fare.Very interesting stuff."
3,"A Light Read, Lacks Intensity and Detail.","This lightweight tale is as somewhat, how should we say, ""Restrained"" as it's lead character; all characters are lacking in detail and intensity as it's story line is. The entire plot reads more like a juvenile or a comic book, rather than a serious piece of Sci-Fi.Not even close to a personal best for the author, or the genre, but still a fairly good read for late night or a rainy weekend."
3,Good premise but hard to stay engaged.,"I'd read a couple of chapters, and didn't really find it engaging. I set it down, and intended on just returning it. I picked it back up because I'd run out of other books, and decided to stick it out in hopes it'd get better. The premise of the story is good and intriguing, but I found the actual content boring. I felt the main character Festina was very flat and 2-D. It was hard to want to keep hearing from her and thought it would have been better told from another character¿s perspective. Also, while I know the language of Oar was to set the tone of how she learned English, it was overdone. The repetitive cussing dulled its purpose and just made it annoying. Rating - Idea premise: B+, Content: C-; Overall: C."
3,A bland SciFi to fill in a few hours,"Explorer Festina Ramos, her partner and a crazy Admiral are all exiled to the planet-of-no-return. They are expendable because they are ugly or freaks. I have to admit I had somewhat expected a comedy with this novel, and while it does raise the odd mild laugh in the end its not a really memorable novel or one that I really want to keep.Somehow Festina and her woes of being exiled fail to raise a great deal of tension. Her problems turn out to mostly reasonably easily solved and the book slides by like a bland desert. I know that there are other books in this series, but I have to say that this first instalment does not make me inclined to seek them out."
2,"Book's OK, but....","The Red Limit is another of Timothy's Ferris excellent distilliations of astrophysics for public consumption. As usual, he is skilled not only in making science concepts comprehensible but bringing into vivid detail the *story* of science -- how we know what we know. It even includes the occasional philosophical discussion.So why the low rating? Because this book is twenty years old. I had assumed that the reprint would maybe have some updated material, but it doesn't. This is effectively a book on the State of Cosmology circa 1983.Don't waste your money on this. Ferris's own Whole Shebang is better written and more up to date. You might also check out Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, which is a very similar book but far better and has been updatee for the most recent discoveries. Bill Bryson's Brief History of Nearly Everything only covers cosmology in basic detail, but is also far more up-to-date."
5,Great Books by Oakley,"Another classic story by author/artist Graham Oakley. The church mice books are his best, the artwork is priceless (and hilarious!). Check his other books out too. They are great."
3,Unresoved Conflict,"Patterson does a fine job of presenting the 26 years between watergate and Bush v Gore but only scratches the surface of the underlying stories that were there. I believe he does not sufficiently cover the dramatic effect Watergate had on the executive branch of government. It empowered the legislative and judiciary branches more than they should have ever been, ever intended by the Constitution. It caused the Presidents that followed to be less-endowed with the executive powers they were intended to have and made the word ""-gate"" into a suffix that described every stumble an executive encountered. It made the American public too distrustful of our leaders, granted it was a failure of great magnitude, but we have since graded any political individual warily."
3,Informative But Never Captured the Times,"I found the two books by Patterson, Grand Expectations and Restless Giant, to be the two weakest of the series. I lived through those times and he caught all the cliches of the times, but didn't capture the times themselves. That said, both books were informative and worth reading."
2,Terrible compared to other volumes in the series,"I love history books and have read just about all the books in this series.This one was very weak. It starts out okay, but as you go along, it just becomes what other reviewers have noted - a very opinionated, biased piece. But even more than that, the book stops reading as history and more as narrative mishmash of events with the ever present biased commentary.I hate putting books down once started but it took me the better part of two years to get to the end of this. I could only take a few pages at a time and then I'd have to set it aside for a while.Anyway, all I can say is this was a major disappointment."
3,More Sociology than History,"This series is generally excellent, but Patterson's effort here drifts off into more sociology than history. He predictably dislikes Nixon like 99.5% of academics. This volume was something of a disappointment."
3,Superficial,"This is a rather superficial book with questionable value. It presents 31 Jack Welch's slogans and without almost any discussion declares them genius. Jack Welch is a very interesting manager whose methods and results deserve a lot more detailed approach. Each of the slogans or ideas should be analyzed, discussed and explained on a good example. Otherwise, as the book is written, the ideas can not be taken seriously by any professional. This book serves as a good introduction to Jack Welch as a manager, but if you want to really learn something, better buy a different book."
3,More of the Same from Robert Slater,"I previously read ""Jack Welch and the GE Way"", also by Slater and published in 1999, but I never read the original version of ""Get Better or Get Beaten"". This newer version of ""Get Better..."" contained a substantial amount of material that was already covered in more detail in ""the GE Way"" book. Except for some of the material covering events since 1999, I think ""the GE Way"" was a better choice of the two, especially if you're looking for more detail and analysis. In many ways I felt like I was just re-reading the other book. On the other hand, if you're looking for sort of the 'Cliff Notes' version and want some good insight into Six Sigma, this newer, smaller work by Slater is certainly satisfactory. There's only marginal benefit to reading both of these."
4,Get Better or Get Beaten!,Robert Slater puts together a factual and wonderfully insightfull collection of Jack Welch's Leadership Secrets. A must read for anyone who wants to be an effective leader.
3,dark,the subject matter is a little dark but it gives another view of poligomy and how it affects some peoples lives forever.
5,A Royal Kiss,This book is full of a young girls romance with a prince it is one of the best books i have ever read and if you like this one check out the other 2 in this sereis THEY ROCK just as much!!!!!!!!
4,Excellent Compilation,"This compilation of early (31-34) Calloway features excellent sound quality and a first-rate band backing up the King of Jive. At a great bargain price, this set is recommended for those who like their 30s swing served hot."
4,deja vu,I don't have anything to add to the other five-star reviews apart from this: I too received this book in 1979 or 80. I recently dug it out and gave it to my six year old son and he LOVES it. Evidently the passage of time and the advent of video games and digital animation has not dimmed this title's appeal.
3,Looks are Deceiving,"I purchased this book as a brand new knitter looking to learn from a book. I was attracted to it because of the cover art, the fact that the book can be freestanding, and the beautiful photographs of the stitches inside. I also liked the look of the designs of the patterns. I won't say this is a horrible book, because it does have some good qualities, but it is not for beginners, as it does not provide detailed explanation in most of the patterns. I also found some errors in some of the patterns, which I thought were on my part, but I went to a knitting store and asked the owner and she said it was not my error, but the book's. The sock pattern, in particular, will make a sock, but with a very awkward feel and fit. I think these patterns are much more suited to the intermediate knitter who can catch an error before it is too late. That being said, I do wish more pattern books were free standing like this one--it made life easier."
3,Not for true beginners.,"This book is nice, but is not as clear on instructions. I would recommend this book to someone that already has the beginning knowledge of basic knitting."
3,LeGrand's Real Estate,"Fight The Good FightI've paid thousands of dollars to attend Real Estate seminars and have been a full time Real Estate investor. LeGrand is the king of selling product. The books are well worth the investment because you can usually learn enough to earn many times what you paid for the information in the book. On the other hand the seminars & courses are really pricey. Many people spend upwards of 20-30k on seminars without ever doing a real estate deal. LeGrand's greatest student is probably Robin Thompson, the Queen of Rehabs, who has become a millionaire many times over using his techniques (I'm one of her students). I have a good friend who spent 5 grand for a LeGrand course and never made any money with it. In essence it all depends on the person. Some can take these techniques and become wealthy. Others can't."
1,Don't waste your time with this garbage,"I seriously suspect that people who gave 5 star reviews for this book work for the author or publisher. This book is nothing but a plug for his real estate courses. Believe me, buying this book will make the author, LeGrand, millionare not you."
1,"talking head, talking bunk","This is like those ""tutorials"" you find for computer programs: after the satisfied customer stumbles through it, they know nothing.If you read books like a goat eats dead grass, leaves, old paper and discarded rubbers, you'll read this, too, probably.If you want to rip people off, go out and find a certified con man. Do time. This guy just burns up his word processor and your money.""Get rich quick. Buy and sell real estate"". NO! Publish junk!"
1,"Stale, refund requested, but never received","The candy we received was not edible. It had long ago expired. We requested a refund, but it never came through. Avoid this vendor."
4,Informative. Has something you've never heard of before,"I picked up this book for my college class on the study of Native Americans from Civil War to present. Even though this is an educational biography on boarding school life, it is actually quite intriguing. Brenda Child completely covers the topic with very interesting material. I won't say that Boarding School Seasons is one of my favorites, but if you are interested in the topic of Indian boarding schools, then you will actually be suprised at how easy it is for this book to keep your attention. If you are viewing this book for a college course, then your class shouldn't be too hard. This is one of the few college required texts that I actually managed to enjoy"
3,Pretty good.,"Interesting research including the voices of the students and their parents. I especially enjoyed reading their letters. The pain of parents separated from their children was palpable. It was, however, somewhat repetitive."
5,INTER GENERATIONAL TRAUMA,Another book with stories about the trauma that the Boarding Schools caused our Indian People of Turtle Island. Many of us are products of the Historical Trauma that our ancestors endured at the hands of the White Man!
1,poor quality high price,"Here's the real review. There is only one DVD, not the three pictured. The lighting is awful, barely able to make out that there are two people dancing. The footwork is never shown close up. Teach very basic steps of too many dances. No intermediate or advanced moves here. Each disk is $25 on their web site, but most material is available for free on line on u tube."
4,Nice maps but literally just covers the Gulf coast,"The maps are great as expected from Michelin, but note that this book covers the Gulf Coast only. No complete state is mapped. The Atlantic coast of Florida is not mapped. It covers from Brownsville, TX to Miami, FL but only for about a hundred miles inshore."
5,THE Ultimate Food for your Lories,This is the only brand of Lory food our flock will accept. Its fruity smell and apparent good taste are the first thing our lories want in the morning and they get very excited waiting for their individual bowls to be passed out.
4,Good,"The book was shipped very well and not damaged from shipping. But, I have to say there was damage from many sharpie marks scrawled on the bottom of the book."
5,very interesting and informative,I have always been interested in weird things and this fills my need
4,Dancey Roots sound.,"Keith Hudson is a thrilling Reggae performer and writer,I'm not a fan of his vocals,however he works within his arrangements,so the songs are crafted personally for his roots style.""civilization"" was the huge cut from this album that was originally produced in 1976-77' This album is A fine Reggae experience."
5,A Gift of Wings,Some really good short stories both for readability and philosophy. Bach has written several other good books such as 'Biplane' and 'Nothing by Chance'.
4,Bach Fantasy Flights,Richard Bach delivers an inspiring story using flight as his spiritual metaphor. A wonderful story. Not as good as Jonathan Livingston Seagull but still worth the read. I file it with my spiritual books to inspire.
2,I was expecting something else.,"I thought it was going to be THE PRODUCT that I wanted. But it wasn't. I bought it to get rid of my blackheads, but it doesn't do anything."
5,Intellectual reading,"I am on an intellectual quest to understand what makes a man a hero and a woman a heroine.Thomas Carlyle did an amazing amount of research and is the first book in a long seriesthat I will read on mythological heroes/heroines and actual heroes/heroines in history.I am interested in how mythological heroes/heroines carried on through the ages and how they influencedactual heroes/heroines throughout history.I was lucky enough to come across this book on archive.org and was able to downloadit and read it for free.The prose of this century is sometimes convoluted which causes you to spend more timetrying to understand and then reflect on the author's words.The book was, as I said, the first read of many to come on an intellectual quest tounderstand the whole 'hero/heroine' concept.I am glad I came across this book. This book piqued my interest more on the whole mythology ofheroism."
1,Tivo set up,"I'm so sorry that I couldn't use this product. I'm not very good on the computer end and didn't realize that this product would not work with the new ""black box"" and digital tuner etc. Still don't understand it completely, but the technician that came to my house to set it all up said I couldn't use it. With this new system coming upon us I feel that when things that won't work on your old TV should state that it would be obsolete after a few weeks. I'm a senior and had no idea that this would or could happen. However, the service and cooperation of all was superb. The customer from whom I dealt with was so friendly and helpful and gracious as well as Amazon themselves. No complaints!!! Just think for us who haven't the knowledge the obsolete items should be marked. Something of that importance needs to be known. I truly have no idea on how or if this product works. It was rated very high when I bought it, but for me it didn't rate at all. Thank you !!!!"
1,Watch out for the gift card scam...,"If you purchase this with a Tivo Service gift card, the card is ONLY good for starting a new account, but you do not recieve the card until two weeks after your box arrives. Still fighting with Tivo, Three months now, they say gift card has been voided, not their problem?!I've tried posting this warning before. No suprise it never makes it to the list."
4,This is Great,"I got this for Christmas, it's fantastic. The only draw back is that I still haven't gotten the dual band working correctly due to my schedule. That's the only problem so far that I've been experiencing so far.The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the ridiculous amount of updates I had d=to download to be able to get access to everything. But it's still great!"
1,bad design,"It's my first time to use TiVo. This product is not user friendly. The hardware setup requirs either network(wired) or phone line, otherwise it won't work. The software designed without exit. If you don't like any choices or you don't which one is good for your case, there is no way to skip. It takes hours to set it up. very bad design in hardware and software.Amazon service is excellent."
2,Limited surround sound support,"This Tivo series2 Dual Tuner has limited surround sound capabilities. If you are NOT using a Cable or Satellite box, chances are you will NOT get surround sound from this device.I was running the coax cable directly into the TiVo, with the outputs going directly to the A/V processor, similar to my VCR and TV. My VCR and TV are both producing surround sound. The TiVo was only able to send a 2 channel signal.I spent almost 2 hours on the phone with TiVo customer support and they were not able to help and just continued to claim that TiVo supports surround. However, on TiVo's own website in the customer forum, I found dozens of entries with issues supporting surround.This appears to be a design flaw."
3,TIVO....not just a DVR,"I didn't find out until AFTER I bought a TIVO that I needed to sign up for monthly payments and have a phone line devoted to it. Plus, after a power failure, it takes about 8 minutes for the TIVO to reboot.I didn't like the way it operated.I took mine to the landfill and got a DVR from my satillite company, it is half the monthly charge and twice as nice."
2,TIVO,The TIVO arrived in good condition and was easly to install. However to use the device you must have Internet access for your tv and subscribe to a service with a montly fee. I was not prepared for either and have returned the device to the original shipper.
1,Horrible video quality,"We were really excited to finally switch from DVR to Tivo, but when our tivo came and we plugged it in, the video quality was awful. Way way worse than the TV ever was. We tried everything, got new cables, called tivo, did the software update. Nothing made it any better. It was so obviously worse than our cable ever looked, we had to return it :( We decided it wasn't worth the effort to try to get a new one. So back to DVR!"
5,TIVO CHANGED TELEVISION FOREVER!,"I no longer schedule my day around TV, I can enjoy any program at any time! I set my TIVO at night before going to bed and don't concern myself about missing any of my favorite programs any more! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!"
1,Bullsh#+!!,"Perhaps by the time you read this Amazon will be clearer in its TiVo description, but in case they aren't, you NEED to know that this is just the hardware for a monthly PAY service. I REALLY felt taken for a ride on this, as they referred to it as a ""service plan""-- well, I don't have a ""service plan"" on my oven, and it works just fine. It is completely misleading to call the fee they charge every month a ""service plan"".Tivo won't be getting a penny of mine. . ."
3,Good DVR at a great price - but outdated technology,"Buyers should know that there is a reason why this DVR is selling for $50. The dual tuner technology is outdated. In order for the dual tuner to work, one of the channels has to be analog. In other words, you can record an analog channel while watching or recording another analog or a digital channel. However, with the recent switch to all digital TV, there no longer are analog channels to watch or record. So, the dual tuner is useless at this point.I'm not completely disappointed with the purchase, however. Even though it is limited to watching and recording one channel at a time, it is still a good DVR at a great price. If you want a good low price DVR, this is the one to get."
5,Don't waste your time with anything else,"After spending years with Cox Communications DVRs (Motorola and then Scientific Atlanta) and dealing with all the problems they cause (not recording everything, not recording at all, crashing, dying etc.) we decided to try TiVo. I have yet to find a flaw with this piece of equipment.It records what its supposed to, when its supposed to. I love my new TiVo."
1,Tivo Is A Scam,"Tivo is a copmlete scam! They sell you a unit with a 1 year contract, and 3 month warranty. The day after it comes off of warranty, they turn down your system so it takes forever to respond to button clicks making the unit worthless. Call them up for support, and they offer to sell you another one for 80$ Save yourself some time, buy a TV Capture card, buy a vcr, buy a DVR from a different company, STAY AWAY FROM TIVO, It's a scam!"
1,TiVo TCD649080,Bought this product after hooking it up I found out you need a telephone jack behind your tv to plug in a phone connection which would tie up my phone line while the TiVo calls to get the tv programing schedule in your area. I sent it back. If the specs would have informed me ahead of time I would not have purchased this product.What a hassle. Shipped it back.
3,Daryl,"It's OK for the price. I gave it an OK because the DVR recording drive, channel information and even getting to the netflix and etc will not work unless you have an account with TiVO ($12.00 monthly fee). I basically use it as a tuner for a Monitor we have in our home. I am sure if I had a TIVO account I would find a lot more use for this receiver."
2,Not worth it.,"My Dad bought a Tivo for my Mom for Christmas, and we were all very excited about it. However, eventhough it was easy to hook up, as soon as it was it started conflicting with our HD channels and it messed up our sound. Also, it goes on rampages taping shows at random and quickly filling up the given 80 hrs. I figured the sound problem was probably just loose audio wires which I checked time and time again. I called the tech support where I waited on hold for almost an hour then they told me that sometimes the audio feed would fragment and they offered to replace the Tivo if I shipped it back in its original box... More effort than its worth.. Should've gotten the Charter DVR. I dont recommend this product if you have a cable box."
2,The point of Tivo escapes me!!,"I bought this so I could share movies and vids from my computer to the tivo and play them on our TV. You still need to pay for a monthly subscription thou. You also need to pay for some software to enable you to do it. I realized it was easier to get a wireless video/audio sender and and send the movies wirelessly to the tv for $0 per month. However, I suppose there is a market for this somewhere its just not for me and my house."
1,Annual Contract,"Please be aware - even when you sign up for a ""Monthly Service Plan"" - the plan itself is an annual one - the only thing monthly is the fee. I personally find this nomenclature incredibly deceptive and purposefully misleading to customers, so I would recommend staying away from Tivo."
2,Unfair....,"The product works fine, however I was not told that you have to have TIVO service for it to work. I did not purchase it for the TIVO system, but to use it solely as a DVR hooked to my computer. Consequently I had to purchase the yearly service of $129.00 just to be able to use it for my purpose which I feel is unfair. I did not choose to send it back due to the shipping costs of returning it and also that they allow you to use it for two weeks without purchasing the service. I didn't hook it up right away due to being on vacation when it arrived. I was too close to being over the return point as well. I feel it was unfair to advertise this product without foreclosing the fact that to use it simpley as a DVR you still need to purchase the high cost of TIVO."
3,tvo,the order was extrememly difficult to complete online and the person on your phone help line did not a have clear grasp of the English langguage..that was unacceptable to me
3,What they don't tell you,"This DVR works great, but you need to get TIVO for it to work. I just wanted to have a DVR--which I had before--and without the subscription it is pretty primitive. Get the subscription with the machine it was a lot cheaper."
5,Tivo allows me to view on my schedule,"My experience with TiVo started when my daughter gave us a series 2 for Christmas years ago.We have used it daily ever since. Then when she had trouble with hers she gave it to me. It works perfectly if it is kept above 60F. When it is colder the audio becomes distorted with scratchy crackling noise other than that it still works great. If I had the money I would upgrade in a minute. Until that time I will continue to use our series 2 TiVos until they no longer work.TiVo TCD746320 Premiere DVR, BlackTiVo TCD649080 Series 2 80-Hour Dual Tuner Digital Video RecorderTiVo Premiere XL4 TCD758250 HD Digital Video Recorder"
1,defective upgrade,Tivo is a great product but this one was defective and I had to send it back and upgrade. Delivery was prompt and product was packed wll.
4,My Tivo,I have always had good luck with the Tivo. I have all of my electronic goodies plugged into an UPS so I have never had equiptment damaged by lightning. Probably more due to luck.
5,Love it,When I say that tivo is the best thing out as far as dvr's right now it's an understatement. This product is absolutely wonderful. I am 100% happy with this product. I highly recommend it.
4,I'D BUY IT AGAIN,LOTS OF GREAT FEATURES AND WILL HANDLE COMCAST DIGITAL CHANNELS. THE REMOTE IS ANNOYING TO USE.
1,Tivo doesn't stand behind their product and the warranty is worthless.,"Don't purchase the extended warranty. I purchased a 3 year extended warranty and my tivo broke after 8 months. We put up with the initial Tivo even though it would not record voice on both turners at the same time like advertised, but when the network card went out, we thought we would get it serviced. The network card went bad, so they sent me another unit, which had a hard drive failure within one day. I got a second exchange and was told my extended warranty would not cover the replacement unit and is void after the 1st exchange.Brandon the customer service person was no help at all. I will never buy anything with a tivo logo again."
3,Service required,"Ouch. You don't just buy a Tivo, you need a Tivo service subscription that costs more (annually) than the Tivo. I might be the only one on the planet that didn't know that.I just wanted a DVR to replace the old VCR, just to record cable TV channels. Without the subscription service, my new Tivo is just a dead box. If you just want to replace the old VCR (like me), make sure the new item has a digital tuner and doesn't require a subscription."
3,Disappointing functionality for digital cable subscribers,"I have been a Tivo fan for several years and recently upgraded to the dual tuner version. Unfortunately, Tivo's idea of ""dual tuner"" is really only designed for use with basic cable. I have digital cable, but I can also just watch the analog signal on TVs with no cable box. In my area, the basic cable signal is weak and has some static so I prefer to watch the digital signal, but I expect to be able to record either. The way Tivo implemented the channel changing, is that it always switches to the analog cable signal and won't even let you pick the digital signal unless you specifically tell it that you don't receive the channel on the analog source. However if you do that, you are down to a single tuner, because it won't allow it to record that channel while you are watching any other.I hate to say it, but this Tivo is a real disappointment."
1,Stop! You can't get Amazon Prime videos on this!,"Stop! You can't get Amazon Prime videos on this! It's also has linking problems that TiVo kept sending me to Amazon for, and Amazon then just showed me how to fix it on my TiVo, when TiVo could have told me. And they charge a monthly fee. Roku has no fee, it's cheaper, and easier to use."
4,Needed additional equipment,"We selected this product for my daughter because at her apt. the cable signal is still analog. There was only one Ethernet signal in the bedroom so we installed a wireless router. The Tivo needs either a phone hook up or an Internet connection. Since she didn't have a land line and no Internet connection in the living room where she wanted her TV we had to purchase a wireless UBS adapter in order to pick up the signal. Also, had a problem with the security of the router not matching the adapter but once we changed the WAP setting to WEP we were able to complete installation. Once set-up, it seems to be working well. Best of all, we had no problem getting a Tivo tech to speak with us."
3,Installation & Rebate Problems,"Installation took several hours and was frustrating. More clear instructions would have been helpful. The Rebate Center site is not customer friendly. Different terms are used interchangeably and instructions are not complete. The site would not take the service number on my unit; my email to rebate customer service was never answered. Eventually I reached a customer service person by telephone (the general customer service number, not the rebate number, which gives you only tapes)who solved the problem manually. I'd suggest calling that number, which is in the booklet that comes with the unit, at the first sign of trouble."
1,Functionally worthless as of June 2009,The dual tuner feature won't work on this model TiVo after June 2009. Don't buy it.
1,Very Bad Experience,"Tivo worked for two weeks using the tivo wireless adapter. All of a sudden it stopped working giving a ""network adapter not found error"" Did the usual resets of the router, tivo, etc and nothing. Called tivo and they sent out a new adapter. Plugged the new adapter in and same problem. Called Tivo again, wasted a bunch of time with people who were clueless. Now I have to wait up 10 business days for a new tivo unit to arrive.To sum it up:-clueless customer service-no way to record at a given time without a network connection-froze oftenIt seems like Tivo is a company that has gotten ahead of itself."
4,hooray for TIVO!,"I gave this to my wife for Christmas and now we are both hooked on TIVO. Basically, just like everyone says it will, it changes the way you watch TV. Bye-bye commercials. See ya stuff we don't want to watch. Now we really do watch only what we want and we get to watch it on our schedule. Having said that, the reason I did not give it five stars is the setup is quite an undertaking. The hooking it up wasn't too bad, but the oodles of menus that follow take a while, and when we got to the part about linking it into our wireless network it went over our heads. We still have yet to get that feature to function. Even after you purchase separately the wireless network adapter, it seems as though the network itself must be set up in a pretty specific way. Luckily you can still do it through the phone line as well or we would be up a creek. Overall I would say that TIVO makes me happy."
