1,Waste of time and money,"I first of all must say that this is my first time reading any books by Anne Rice. Now since tht is out of the way, time for my review. I did not enjoy reading these books. I read all three in hopes that they would get better. I found out quickly that they did not get better as I progressed. All of the chapters are very repeptative, someone being spanked,abused and or humiliated in some kind of way. There was no explaination as to why Beauty and all the other princes and princesses were made to be so called pleasure slaves. What the ""training"" was for and how it was suppose to make them better. I understand that this was suppose to be a retelling of the Sleeping Beauty story but the whole story was implausible. In short do not waste your time and or money."
3,predictable,"boring, boring boring. how much paddling can a girl, guy and reader take? if all there is is sex sex sex, i get desensitized and bored. i'm all for a naughty read, but there really needs to be a story involved, and this just isn't it. disappointed."
2,"Starts out fascinating, gets repetitious and tiresome","If you are into BDSM, or just fantisize about it, this trilogy will feed that fantasy to the max. Deeply erotic, it touches every conceivable permutation of slave/owner and bondage/discipline fantasy that any individual could conceive of, short of absolute brutality and injury. To Ann Rice's credit, by the third book, she does develop some new twists (if you last that long--I barely did, because I was getting bored with the endless permutations on the same theme), and the ending of the third book is something of a surprise. This Trilogy is quite a departure from her vampire books. The writing is technically good, but I found the series overall repetitious and not worth the time. I read all three, ultimately, to be able to say that I had. I certainly wouldn't do it again. I then turned around and sold the set on Amazon!"
5,Sleeping Beauty Trilogy,"I read the Trilogy after reading The Fifty Shades of Grey series. I enjoyed it very much. It is very brutal in the BDSM. Anne Rice is very dark in her writing but I knew that when I ordered the series. All in all, I was very pleased."
5,Amazing Series,"I began reading this book in Barnes and Noble after reading a review on this website recommending it. I had hoped to explore more about the book before I bought it. At first, I was a little disturbed with Sleeping Beauty being degraded, but soon after I was hooked. This book is truly a work of art that inspired me to keep reading books of this nature. This book was erotic and a wonderful read. I highly reccommend it."
2,Not Impressed.,"I was looking forward to reading some erotic literature, but found this book (I only made it through the first) to be extremely repetitive and poorly written in general. Much like a porn flick, the plot was weak and the characters even more so. I expected more from such an acclaimed author, and a woman, at that!"
3,Struggling,I Haven't gotten very far. I'm kind of Having a hard time separating the Sleeping Beauty part from the sex parts
3,Can be a sleeper,Not the best reading but not the worst. Time killer. If your looking for something like 50 shades this is not it.
2,eh...,"I got this box set and read all the books. The premise of the series is extraordinarily good, and could have been not only sexually hot but philosophically and literarily deep. However, the execution was not good. Mostly, the series starts off decently but just gets more and more boring as it goes."
5,An Erotic Tale of Growth and Discovery,I had received the trilogy as a birthday gift. I do enjoy the fantasy world of Anne Rice and this is no acception. The reader gets to enjoy with the main characters how they grow not only sexually but also emotionally. Some reviewers I've read got so hung up the repetion of some of the action that they miss the point. So read and enjoy the series.
2,Overpriced for Content...Disappointed,"I've only just gotten through the first book...boring and very odd. But I will definitely continue on to the next two books since I purchased them as a set. I feel the set is way overpriced for the content. I paid the same price for ""50 Shades of Grey"" and got more than my money's worth out of that reading. The whole physical set was so much nicer, more reading, bigger books, soooo much more interesting...better books. I definitely would not place this trilogy (Sleeping Beauty) in the same price category as ""50 Shades of Grey""...no comparison in quality of content.Thank you,V"
4,Excellent!,"It's not pointless, as mentioned in a prior review. The sex in the books is in and of itself minor, but it underlies the recurrent theme, the struggling of the chars to find their own sexual identities. For those who enjoy Dom/sub erotica, these books certainly provide entertainment spanning the field of D/s. For those who enjoy romantic, erotic fiction, this trilogy will provide hours of fascinated reading. I, personally, couldn't put them down, for the simple fact that the background and characters are so incredibly rich and complex. One is drawn into the lives of the varied characters, and must -know- what happens to them in the end, before putting the books down."
1,Didn't enjoy it in the least!,"I bought these books because they sounded as if they were going to be a good read but that's not what happened when I actually started reading them. These entire books are all sex and don't get me wrong, I don't mind it but it's page after page of pointless sex. I found myself skimming through the pages so that I may get to some actual facts about the books but it never happens. Every good book must have love and passion in it, but these books are just ridiculous."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"I had high hopes for these Novels and I hated them! HORRIBLE! Rape, brutal treatment..etc..too much to enjoy a story."
1,Horrible,"The author says if you like 50 Shades-you will like this. There is nothing similar in this trilogy that compares to 50. In 50 it was two ppl making a choice. In Sleeping trilogy-they were all forced into sex-slavery-and humiliation. There was no men on men or women on women in 50. The author needs to at least re-write her intro to the trilogy and tell that it is for ppl that like depraved sex stories. I am totally open minded-I purchased and read all three books, but I would not advise anyone who liked 50 to fall for this set of books."
2,a little too much for my taste,After reading 50 shades of Grey I was looking for another erotica type book series. A local radio station was talking about this series and my husband recommended it. So we bought it. It it was darker and harsher than the 50 shades books. just not my thing. Too much spanking and paddling and being sex slaves.
1,Painfully trying to get through this one.,Painfully trying to get through this one. Anne Rice is a good writer but this one is not one of them. Unless this has a surprise ending I am keeping it at a one star. I don't feel connections of any of the characters. It seems it is all about the pain. No love or tenderness. Not my bag I guess.
1,Don't waste your money,"I love erotica, and typically I love the control aspect of sexual escapades. These books had both, but I wasn't even slightly turned on as I read the first book, I skipped 3/4ths of the 2nd, and have not even bothered with the third. I don't find constant debasement and rape a turn-on I guess, that is exactly what happened in these books.I thought 50 Shades of Grey was bad, but I can't even adequately describe exactly how awful these books were. I am not sure what I hated more: the opening rape scene, the lack of imagination and repetitiveness in all the sex scenes, lack of character development.These books and story lines, could have really fantastic if they didn't lack in every way possible."
1,Terrible waste of time,I read this book thinking it might be a good summer read. It was a total waste of time and I wish I had never opened it. The content and scenes are repetitive. There are story lines that start and stop and for my taste it was too non-consensual.I DO NOT Recommend this..
2,Boring and endlessly repetitive,"Kudos to Anne Rice for dreaming up a different world, rich in detail albeit twisted, but the same spanking and anal penetration descriptions over and over for three entire books left me bored to tears. I expected more but perhaps this was written early in Rice's career, IDK, I certainly wouldn't read more erotica from her."
1,Absolutley Brutal and Almost Scary,"I started reading this book with an opened mind. I expected Desire, love, and sensuality. THERE WAS NONE!!! This book was absolutley horrific. The opening scene of rape and moving on to torture and sodomy is not for the faint of heart. There is not a inch of sexy or profocotive.....just bonewrenching horrifying. No woman or man should go through anything like that and for the author to think of these scenes as an ""erotic"" read is scary in its own right."
2,not what I'd hoped for...,"OK, let me state right up front that I adored Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Therefore, I was honestly hoping to be enthralled by her 'Beauty' trilogy. I was most disappointed, however. Anne took a great idea and turned it into almost pure farce--spanking on top of beating on top of...well, you get the idea. Virtually the entire storyline for all three books revolved around mercilessly beaten buttocks and anuses (and the innumerable things the author dreamed up to insert into them). It was SO constant that I quickly lapsed from amusement to boredom on into irritation. The principal bootlicking wretches, otherwise masquerading as main characters, were hard to empathise with or even like. After three books I still found Beauty to be a guttering twit. I know many, many people ardently loved this series, and there were occasional brilliant flashes of Rice's lush prose, but ultimately I just couldn't find much to like in this trilogy."
1,disappointing,"It was barely erotic as advertised...there was barely any sex...just pointless beatings, beatings and more beatings of defenseless people. Constant punishment for no crime and nothing to be turned on about. Even the sex scenes were painful. Ridiculous book."
1,Pure Garbage,"I'm a huge Anne Rice fan, but I was so very disappointed by the first book. I couldn't even bring myself to read the other two, but flipped through them to confirm that they were just like the first. Basically this book is about rape, spanking, and sodomy. It's so unsubstantial and has little to no character or plot development. Penthouse Letters is more interesting. Why, Anne, why????? There could have been SO much more to this trilogy, but page after page was just sex. If you're into S&M and rape, then this is the book for you. Me? Not so much. I'll stick to the vampire series and try to forget that I ever laid eyes on this piece of crap. No wonder why she wrote this under another name..."
1,dissapointed,Have read her work in the past and enjoyed it but this seems to be only spanking and sadism. Not at all like 50 Shades which I found to be an enjoyable series. Sorry I bought it.
3,Do you like spanking?,"It's an interesting series, and very creative in some parts, but too long for my taste.I'm not a prude, and I think some BDSM writing can be genuinely fascinating and erotic whether or not it's personally your cup of tea.However, Sleeping Beauty focusses rather tightly on spanking and pony-play fetishes, largely to the exclusion of sex, romance and emotion. I simply don't find these activities as fascinating as Roquelaure apparently does, and so for me many sections of this trilogy rather dragged.Nevertheless there are some delightful vignettes amongst the formulaic ""x spanked y / y paddled x"" scenes. It's worth reading, but not the best erotica, or even the best s&m erotica I've ever read. If the best ten chapters were picked out into an anthology, or if the same story were told in fewer pages I would like it much more."
1,Not what I expected at all!,I thought this book would be a great read with a nice dose of erotisism. It just turned out to be a story about a girl who gets spanked for 500 pages. The entire storyline revolved around one spanking to the next. It got boring really fast and I never finished it. I really regret buying it!
1,Hated It,"I bought this book, since it was recommended for those who enjoyed ""50 Shades Trilogy"". It is nothing like the ""50"" books, and it took erotic to a dark side that I found repulsive. The erotic scenes were not erotic in a romantic sexy sense, but in a degrading sense of punishment and discipline found in medieval times. I read the entire book, since I was in a 3rd world country with no internet access to get a new book, and I was repulsed from nearly cover to cover."
4,Gift.,Disclaimer: I have not read these books. I bought these as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves them.Every free moment she has is spent reading these books. If you have a woman in your life that likes these type of books (romance/fantasy) they will most likely enjoy the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy.
5,Fantastic read!!,"All I can say is, ""WOW."" The books held my interest until the last word.Bought the books for a friend of mine...he loved them!!!"
1,Ahhhhgg!!!!,"Jeez! This book is sickening. I cannot believe that peopleactually liked this gross story. This story is all about weird andstrange sex. I was sometimes afraid to turn the page, because of whatI might read next......There were descriptions I certainly could havedone without...."
1,"Disturbing, NOTHING sensual about these books","In NO way should these books be compared to Fifty Shades of Grey!! These were filled with disturbing images and just plain gross storylines! I guess if you like reading chapters upon chapters of men being raped by other men, things being shoved up every nook and cranny on a person, women being groped by eveyone, slapped and humiliated then these books are for you. Gross, just gross!"
2,not my genre,"I've read other books by Anne Rice and enjoyed them thoroughly. This one just didn't work for me. I've read other books in that genre that were fine, but I just don't care or the brutality. I still love Amazon.com, though. It's not their fault, and they are my #1 place to shop."
1,VERY VIOLENT,"I was looking for some kind of romantic/racy adventure book...This is NOT it! The sexual violence and humiliation spewed across almost every page of the first half of the first book in the series was enough to stop me from reading any further. I'm a pretty liberal person and can usually laugh about crazy writing, but this just made me feel sick."
1,Not at all Erotic,"I am an avid reader and an erotica fan, and was delighted when I got the first book of the triology as a gift. However, I cannot even force myself to read past the first few chapters because it is all the same. Personally, spanking does not turn me on, so maybe if does you it might be more enjoyable. This book might get better as it goes on, but based on the other reviews and my lack of patience, I don't know if I'll keep reading to find out."
3,Hard to define...,"I didn't know what to expect with this trilogy, and what I got, wasn't what I thought it would be. This tale is interesting, sometimes disturbing, sometimes touching and always erotic. The love/hate here knows no bounds between gender, age or race. There are some fascinating observations about human behavior, emotions and what lies deep inside each one of us. I've never read anything quite like this book and probably never will again. I recommend it just for curiosity of it all."
3,Kinda Redundant,"The first 2 books were cool, exciting. but the last one was very redundant. Its like she cut and paste the last book from the firt 2 books. Same passion scenes and commentary."
5,Imaginative,"This collection of books grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go. Even when you have finished the third book, you crave for more. I give this book the highest recommendations possible, being one of Anne Rice's best collections possible. It seems to be the culmination of her writing career, branching out into other genre`s and succeeding at it."
5,An EXCELLENT piece of writing,"However you view the material, the writing is incredible in this series. I personally found the storyline very interesting and erotic. If you are personally not interested in or turned off by any sort of sexual deviation, then these are probably not the books for you. Anne Rice has taken a classic (boring and vanilla) tale and given it a painful kinky twist. A pure and innocent Beauty quickly finds herself in a world where she is not revered for her status of birth, and learns how to please her keepers.I highly recommend this book to those who would like to see a different side of the mirror...watch out for that paddle though, it can be quite painful *grin*."
4,Three D/s stories that really rock!,"Set in medieval times, this trilogy follows several young 'slaves', primarily the princess Beauty, as they're trained as sexual submissives.Perhaps only devotees of BDSM will enjoy these books. But on the other hand, the cerebral aspects of why some of us find domination and submission pleasurable - even addictive - are also included, and are as well-written as the explicit scenes."
4,Eight Paws to Georgia: Kiska's Final Journey,"Pamela Bauer Mueller has a special gift in communicating the feelings and emotions of both humans and animals through the written word in a very unique and loving way. Together with the accompanying illustrations, which at times are humorous, the author guides her readers through the many adventures and challenges that Kiska and Jasper face as they move from the rainy and cool Pacific Northwest to the warmth and humidity of the ""deep South"", adjusting to new adventures and surroundings. Her insight in expressing the personal loss of a loving family pet through the words of her own beloved Kiska, make this little book a fitting tribute to the final saga of the Kiska Trilogy. It will be great reading for both children and adults"
2,Slim book,"The reading was okay, but there wasn't much meat to it. Each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story. Only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located. One of the most interesting pages told about how Disney bought up all of the FL property using fictitious companies. For the price, I was disappointed as most of it is not notable. If you're a Disney buff, get this from the library and save the $$$ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting."
2,"Didn't come close to ""bowling me over"" as author states in review!","I was disappointed by this ""behind the scenes"" book. Not at all as entertaining and delightful as the author wants you to believe. Some interesting facts nestled in a whole lot of information available from other books or Disney themselves. Borrow from the library if you absolutely have to read it yourself"
1,Not alot of new stuff in here for True Disney Buffs,"I found that I know about 95 of the 101 things in this book and the stuff I did not know was not that interesting. The book, in my opinion, is poorly written. Some sentences did not even make sense to me and they did not gel into a good paragraph. It was a jagged read and I would not recommend it for Disneyphiles that already know the ""common"" secrets of WDW. My family is part of the Disney Vacation Club, and we have visited WDW at least 2x every year for the past 20 years, just to give you my background!"
1,"Um, yeah... I'd have killed for even 1 thing I didn't already know.","I should have known from the cover of this book that there was trouble in River City. Trouble with a capital T that rhymes with B that stands for ""bored now."" There was literally not a single thing in this book that I hadn't heard/read/learned somewhere else. I suppose if you had absolutely positively never in your life been to Disney or read anything at all about the park, you might be interested... then again, probably not. It's positively insulting to Disney fans that the author tries to pass off what amounts to information readily available in a thousand other places as his own work."
2,:(,This book contained 101 things I already knew. This book would be great for someone who is going to visit the park for the first time. If you have been studying Disney trivia for awhile you will already know these things
3,About what I expected,"After reading other reviews I thought this would not be full of things I didn't know. I've read alot of trivia books and visited WDW many times. I found a few things I didn't know in the book, but not many. I purchased the book as a guide to carry with me in the parks, and remind me to look for these ""secrets"". The book is laid out in order from land to land and park to park that would make this easy to do."
3,"OK, but not great","While the book had a handful of new tidbits and trivia, much of it was either the same as can be found in other assorted Disney trivia books, or were things already familiar to Disney fans. Nonetheless, it is an acceptable book."
4,Good!,"This is a great book for any one who is interested in the details of Disney World. There is a lot of information is this book that is revealed to you on the ""backstage"" tours at the parks, but with the book, it's easier to remember all the stuff you learned!"
1,Linden Method purchase,I bought this item hoping to receive it before I was due to travel. The book arrived on time but clearly I was shipped a returned item. The original packaging had been removed and jammed in a box. The CD case was still wrapped but broken. The Set was missing a key registration page. And the worst was that the outside binder was printed in English but the inside pages were all in Spanish. I ordered a replacement. It arrived in new unopened condition but still written in Spanish inside an English printed Binder. Very Disappointing. I will not be reordering.
5,nice gift,"i my name is marc and am from canada (quebec city), i bought the package from the linden program including:cd,1dvd,book. i was so relief to know that my situation is live by many other that it already be part of my recovery. i listen to the visualation excercice almost everyday (miss 2 or 3 time ) and it give me a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiig relief of my personal anxiety problem. at first it was not custum to me to listen to that kind of c.d but each day i listen to them ,more and more i do feel a major well being. it increase my level of confidence ,my gym training are much more efficient by getting a real concentratrion and no bad feeling so it just wonderful and the book is a major good reference to any qestion i ask myself when i got some bad anxiety problem. so it was just a small e-mail of big thank you ,i do hope that this e-mail will go to m.linden or miss linden. so thank again to take care of people in bad situation .merci beaucoup.(french word.) marc ."
4,Linden Method works,"I read a lot about Charles Linden and his work. He's an ex sufferer of anxiety and panic disorders and that's why his experience is valuable to those suffering for the conditions knowns as depersonalisation, derealization, panic attacks and so on.His focus is on how the amygdala works, a tiny organ in the brain responsable with anxiety and how we can retrain our amygdala to a low, more suitable and normal level of anxiety.for this he develps some rules that the sufferer must obey, for exemple not to obsess, to distract etc..For additioanl help regarding those conditions you might also check out a new book, also from an ex sufferer, calledThe Fractured Mind"
1,Recycled Claire Weekes,"Dr. Claire Weekes, an Australian M.D. and research scientist, created the ""bibles"" that define anxiety, panic attacks, OCD, and phobias, especially the paralyzing Agoraphobia (fear of leaving the safety of home).Written in the 1960's, her groundbreaking books ""Hope and Help For Your Nerves"" and ""Peace From Nervous Suffering"" and several compilations from them provide the original cognitive approach to cure that are the basis for Linden's method and that of virtually every other successful anxiety treatment program. The Weekes books are remarkable for their clarity and absence of medical jargon.To bypass all the ""magical"" promises and hype of others and avoid the often addictive medication path, read Dr. Weekes's life altering books or order the ""Pass Through Panic"" CD from Amazon and hear her compassionate, encouraging voice outlining the way to overcome anxiety, panic attacks, phobia and depression. She is the real thing."
5,Very Uplifting,"Two elderly Jewish Czech-American friends go on a road trip to retrace their steps through WWII. The younger man was an adolescent concentration camp prisoner, then a reluctant communist, then a famous writer. The older man, fearless and passionate, eventually become a British fighter pilot, then a political prisoner from 1950-55 for refusing to sign a communist loyalty oath, then a professor."
5,Fascinating,"A beautiful, fascinating, well made film, full of thoughtful observations and riveting stories of survival. Ultimately it's about a friendship between two men in their seventies, with an ending that might surprise you. Both are philosophers, in very different ways, and they see the world quite differently. And that tension is the source of the film's enduring strength."
5,Don't get married without it,"So glad that this is back in print!--else my friend might not have got her copy back that I borrowed. This is THE best marriage book I've ever read. Original, insightful, practical, very true to life, very Biblical."
3,surprisingly low-keyed vocal trance from Guiseppe D,"Female vocal trance produced by a remixer of some big stuff, yet there's really not much power to this tune. Rather than living up to the full, strong feel of more recent tracks by Ian Van Dahl and Lasgo, this one feels somewhat dated and subdued--more like old Alice DeeJay stuff from 2000. Only 4 tracks, and its just short and long versions of the same two mixes: original radio edit (3:19), remix radio edit (3:03), original extended (4:48), remix extended (5:06)."
4,"Beware, will not play on all DVD players.","This release will not play on Sony PS3 (region A) DVD players.My ""4 star"" rating is based soley upon web based reviews from others whose DVD players were not limited to region A. For some strange reason, Amazon will not let you post a review unless and until you indicate a star rating, even if you are incapable of viewing the product as in this case."
5,Magical,This was one of those movies that you don't want to end. I thought it was brilliantly done and the acting was superb. The entire movie from start to finish was delightful and I would highly recommend it to everyone! Until seeing this movie I knew nothing about Beatrix Potter and I must say I barely remember any of her stories from childhood except The Tales of Peter Rabbit. I can't say enough good things about this movie so I suggest you watch it.
4,FAMILY LOVE STORY,"THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. EVER WONDER WHERE STORIES COME FROM? THIS MOVIE GIVES YOU A TASTE OF ANOTHER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE AND A YOUNG GIRLS DREAMS."
2,Incompatibility issues,"I have the same problem than other people. When I try to play the movie on a Sony BDP make that the player crashes and reboot!!.Is a kind of comic at first time, but serious, is very sad.I really hope someday can watch the movie in Hi Def."
4,Watched it once and had to buy it,"I liked this movie, it was just a nice movie to enjoy. I loved learning a little about this children's author."
5,Plays in the EU,"This highly under rated film will bring great joy and tears to anyone with a heart. Thoroughly enjoyable, Renée Zellweger is a joy as Beatrix Potter the children's author who has brought joy to countless children over the years. Her drawings and water colours brought to life literally! Ewan McGregor also gives a good performance but it is Renée Zellweger who makes it magical.My only wish is that the film was longer to include more of what Beatrix Potter did for the Lake District.The blu-ray version is worth an investment, picture quality is superb. Unfortunately there seems to be issues of incompatibility within the US. I can tell you that within the EU the disc works fine."
4,"Pleasant, charming film...","that one can watch with children. I became totally involved, forgetting that Ms.Zellweger was not actually Beatrix Potter.The visually lovely film comments on women in British society without being heavy handed.While very pleasant, there is enough drama to keep the film from being vapid. Highly recommended for mothers and daughters to enjoy together."
5,Hopeful,"If you know nothing in particular about the life of Beatrix Potter, this movie may surprise you. It is a different time, a different set of social rules. Even though Beatrix tries to respect the social parameters her parents are intent upon, she is someone who has her own personal goals. She is determined to advance her own goals all the while trying to please parents who will never be pleased. The 23 books that Beatrix produced over her lifetime and which many of us take for granted as ""always being there"" were produced at great personal expense -- but in the end with great personal satisfaction. A movie that makes you feel anything is possible."
3,Great Film,"This was very interesting, and educational of how these books came about and what a great story about the woman who wrote the children's books. ""Peter Rabbit"". Lovely film."
5,"Sad, but good!","I really enjoy this movie. I grew up with Beatrix Potter's books (well, some of them) and find it interesting to learn about her life and the how her books came to be published.I enjoyed the story that is depicted in this movie, though it is sad. I enjoyed the acting and the beauty of the places where Miss Potter spends her time."
5,Enchanting Tale of Miss Potter,"Whimsical, winsome, enchanting, artistic are all words that apply to this wondrous film. It is one of my favorite films of the last decade as the illustrations of Peter Rabbit come to life. It captures the Edwardian age and the flavor of how we imagine the creator of Peter Rabbit to be. Rene Zellwegger is magical in her role as Miss Potter.The scenery and sets are divine. It's a perfect family film and one you can watch over and over. If you love films about creative women who triumph in their times despite societal constraints, this is one of those celebratory stories."
1,"5 stars for movie, zero stars for this blu ray release",******WARNING******* This disc will NOT play on ANY sony region a/1 player...PERIOD! Don't believe me? then read the other reviewers.
4,So Sweet,"Such a sweet little movie! If you grew up reading Beatrix Potter, you will know and love the characters in this movie. A little sweet, a little sad and a whole lot of cute!"
5,Miss Potter,I loved the movie EXCEPT I found Renee Z's facial expressions distracting. The movie was charming and I am sure I will watch and enjoy it again.
3,Was Beatrix Potter kind of dotty?,"The movie depicts a somewhat homely old maid who livedin a childish world of her stories and animals.The love affair with her publisher's younger brotherwho was assigned her book to get him out of his older brother's hairis a strange mix of 19th morays right out of Jane Austin.Her mother and father, it seems, would rather she be a lonely old maid,than marry below her station and disgrace them.All their scheming backfires when he unexpectedly dies of a fever.So what did she do with the rest of her life?Why is she considered one of the first ""modern"" Britishwomen? I liked the movie, but I suspect that shewas much better balanced than the movie gives her credit for."
2,MISS POTTER BLU-RAY BLUES,"BUYER BEWARE!! This is the first Blu-ray disc which is supposed to play in regions A,B, and C, but it did not play on either one of my SONY Blu-ray players which have up to date firmwares. I believe the problem is that the standard and Hi-def content was encoded at 25 frames per second which is considered PAL, and will NOT play on U.S. Blu-ray players. I am returning my copy to AMAZON, and I hope they become aware of this incompatibility issue, and can replace these with compatible discs.This is a fabulous film which deserves to be watched in HIGH DEFINITION."
5,Miss Potter,"This was a delightful film that took the viewer into the life of Beatrice Potter, an amazing woman who was decades ahead of her time. It was a pleasant reminder to stay true to your creative spirit against all social expectations."
5,Miss Potter,This movie will delight adults and children alkie....even those that are ignorant of her brilliant stories.
5,Miss Potter,"This DVD is a must for any history and landscape lover. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to see it with the captions ( I have a hearing problem and it is a plus that movies have this feature). I have just started looking at the journal, and again I would say I love all the little tidbits about this remarkable woman, Beatrice Potter."
4,Renee stop pouting those lips!,"Ok I said it, I don't like the way Renee squeezes, purses her lips it drives me crazy. Other than that this is cute movie. Based on the real life of Miss Potter the author of children's books like Peter the Rabbit. It showcases Miss Potter's artistic abilities and imagination to which she dedicated her lifes work to. I really enjoyed the animated drawings that popped out randomly. This is good one to watch with the family."
5,Miss Potter DVD,Miss PotterThe movie was excellent in every way. It is in our top 10 of all movies that we have ever seen. A beautiful love story with magnificant outdoor scenery from England.
5,Charming,Miss Potter is a remarkable story. It has been a while since I have read anything about Beatrix Potter but thought the movie did her justice. Everyone was perfect in their roles. Animating the characters of her books and showing her connection to them was just the right touch
5,"good dvd, and shipped in a timely fashion","Love this movie, a quiet and very underrated movie. Love the mixture of fantasy and love's reality. I would highly reccomend this to all ."
4,Miss Potter,"This well casted period piece gives us a good look into one of the most famous writers of childrens books. Beatrix Potter was an amazing woman and Ren'ee Zellwegger plays her incredibly well. She shows us her quirks and unwielding believe in her animal characters. We see her talent in her style of painting them and creating stories about them. Ewan McGregor plays her publisher with style and heart. I was drawn into her life story and found myself wanting more after the end of the movie. A romance and drama that is mostly lighthearted. A great documentary and other extras are included to fill you in even more. I highly recommend this entertaining story of Beatrix Potter. If you enjoyed this catch ""Finding Forester"".CA Luster"
5,A Nice Film,You won't regret watching or purchasing this film about the life of Beatrix Potter. It was tastefully portrayed and enjoyable to watch. It wasn't so much of a sappy sweet chick-flick that my husband regretted watching it. He liked it also. We both recommend this film!
4,Miss Potter is delightful!,"Renee Zellweger is absolutely charming in this lovely rendition of Beatrix Potter. I was very fortunate to have visited the Lake District and to visit Beatrix Potter's farm. This movie reminded me of how magnificent the countryside is and her efforts to preserve the beauty of this area brought back some wonderful memories. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll clap your hands as if you were reading her books for the first time."
5,Renee's many hats....,I don't believe there's a movie role out there that Renee couldn't take on and bring her special charm to it...she is so believable and endearing as Miss Potter. Ewan is like adding icing to the cake in this story - he's so handsome and lovable.
5,Miss Potter,"This movie depicted a ""gentler"" time as well as the story of Beatrice Potter. The manners and mores of the time were refreshing and the movie was beautifully done. Beverly Reynolds"
3,Pepper and Cumin,"This scent is one of the legendary classics, so I had to sample it. It started off all black pepper and citrus. I though I was going to love it. It dried off to a nice midnote of cardamom and powder, but then it dried down into a horrible base of Cumin only slightly less unpleasant than day-old B.O. Think a bag of Burger King left in your car overnight. It smelled a bit like that. But in a perfumey sort of way. I kept wanting to like it. After 45 minutes I washed it off."
5,Awesome desk speaker,"I bought this speaker to use around my apartment, it works great and has a good sound quality. I was worried that it might not work with my mp3 player, but I haven't had any problems. This is a great product, and I have told my friends to pick one up."
4,Zadro speakerman,I really like this product. I got it for use in my office. I have it sitting on my desk and I can hook up my MP3 player. It works great. It could use a bit better bass sound but for the price it works really well. It is also really cute and makes a good conversion piece on my desk. I have several co-workers who now want one.
1,A piece of Junk,This thing was so cheap that the batteries wouldn't stay in it (even with the door closed) and so the music would only play in short (I mean 1/2 second) bursts. Clearly I had been sent a product that had already been returned by someone else -- what a waste of my time -- my kid was in tears. When will companies stop trying to rip people off by trying to pass off obviously shoddy products that have already been deemed defective by someone else to a new consumer. This is my first and believe me my *last* experience with this vendor and this product.
1,A Defense of What?,"Mr. Gudding, through equal parts esoteric double-talk and sheer force of ego, has produced an annoying collection of poems that, aside from further alienating any reader who questions the current climate of American poetry, delivers little more than a few giggles for the benefit of, no doubt, cloistered academics whose experience with the outside world has dimmed to the point of emotional [immaturity]."
3,Disney Friends Together,"This cd has some really cute and fun songs. The hard to find recording of ""A Cowboy Needs A Horse"" is on this cd. Beware, Disney characters (Mickey, Goofy and Donald) sing along on every song; therefore, this would be a disc for true Disney fans only!"
3,Nuisancey.,The laptop tends to fall off the rack. Adjustability in height is good but it seems to always be off center or skewed to one side.
5,Does what it's meant to.,"Fits BMW brake fluid reservoirs (potentially some other brands - I know it fits my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 as well, but haven't tried beyond that). Threads correctly & seals tight - not much to add to that."
3,"""New but poor"".","I'm a big LN fan. Good to hear some new work. However, the sound quality is poor. The production was done so that the vocals are way in the background."
1,good introduction ....,"The introduction to this translation of Sanskrit poetry is very good. Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the other reviewers about the translation. The English rhymes in such short poems make them seem utterly trivial. The amount of dexterity required to produce a few rhymes gives them a slightness, which I suspect cannot be true of the originals. I cannot read Sanskrit, but since it is an inflected language there is room for subleties that are obliterated by the one dimensional tendency of pushing towards a rhyme. One gets no sense of the art and craft that we are told is in these possibly sophisticated miniature poems."
3,It was okay.,"Got this for my husband for his birthday, but looks very cheap. The stones were crooked and looked as though they were going to come off."
1,Apoptygma Berzerk - Cambodia,"Cambodia is an awful song, there, I said it. I have no idea how this came to be a single, the music is boring, the lyrics are horrible, the vocal melody is laughable. On this two track single, we are treated to this horrible song and a live version of Unicorn. Now, Unicorn is a great song, and normally I love it, but in this live version, it is absolutely slaughtered. The vocals are so bad they become annoying, and the music, well the music is sequenced so you really can not screw it up. But again, the vocals are so bad that it destroys the entire song beginning to end. This is an absolutely worthless single and Apop should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it."
4,"A fun, easy, and insightful oracle","I really liked this. *Celtic Oracles* works a lot like the I Ching; you throw coins, and based on how many heads and tails you get, the book directs you to a specific message. Unlike the I Ching, though, the messages are all based on Celtic archetypes and symbols, like ""Hag the Initiator"", ""The Wondrous Child"", ""Sacred Wells"", and so on. Each message is illustrated with a pretty black-and-white drawing, and contains a lot of background about the symbol or archetype. Then it tells you what the symbol means in terms of the reading. *Celtic Oracles* has a feminist slant, just for your information. It also acknowledges both Christianity and Paganism. Coming from either point of view, anyone interested in applying Celtic archetypes to her/his life will enjoy this."
2,Didn't Work for Me,"I read the reviews below and hoped for the same experience. I have had my oracle for 2 years now and it hasn't given me an accurate reading ever. This is not to diss the book, but to let you know that not everyone will have wonderful results with it, so expect nothing. It is also slightly influenced by Wiccan beliefs, so if this bugs you, it probably isn't the book for you."
1,A Rip Off,"This oracle is a celtisized I-Ching, that she invented in fifteen minutes. She also explains why her oracle might not work, which is telling. Europeans already have an earth oracle, it's called geomancy."
4,Shocks for my 325i 89 Vert,Good price - came in like three days .I bought expensive bilstens for the front- sorry I did not get these they see m just as good as expensive ones
3,Shorts are good but not that good.,It has 10 animated shorts all of them came from Canada:Here's the list:1. Cactus Swing2. La Salla3. 64 Million years ago4. Evolution5. Hot Stuff6. Every Dog's Guide To Home Safety7. The Family That Dwelt Apart8. The Dingles9. The Old Lady's Camping Trip10. Every ChildThe Dingles short is really cute.
5,"I love ""Spirit of Wonder"" !","This is easily the best Manga I have ever read. I just picked it up one day at my local comics store because of its interesting cover art, and the art is great! The author Kenji Tsuruta has an amazing style of art that is just breathtaking. The story is excellent and very romantic, with a nice scientific twist. I highly recomend the manga for anyone!"
4,a warm blend of amber and sandalwood,"A unique and eye catching perfume bottle - curved with a marron glace copper lace corset for a luxurious wrap.Top notes are rose made even more mysterious by a tad of rum and orchid. Base notes include mere hints of vanilla, sandalwood and sweet amber.A rare scent best for evening and special occasions."
2,Poor quality,I just bought this dresser and nightstand for my daughter. It is very flimsy and the drawers won't slide properly. They stick and when you pull them they come apart. I have had to glue the fronts back on to 2 drawers within a 2 day period.
3,dresser,"This dresser is a ok dresser,, I had to assemble the whole thing from start to finish,, when receiving this dresser use alot of wood glue and change the backing to a piece to plywood to give it more suport,, it was kinda smaller than I imagine but it will have to do,, the shipper never left any info till the end when it was being delivered. I do belive you can find a better dresser than this one..."
5,Bill Hicks' legacy in print,"I have seen Bill Hicks once, 7-8 months before he died way too early. Nice to have his thoughts in book form, different context than the CDs and DVDs. This book should be required reading for all Americans."
5,Bill Hicks is worth remembering,Bill Hicks needs more coverage. Thankfully this book and a few others exist. This book has interviews with Hicks as well as transcripts of many of his performances. Unfortunately some of the transcribed performances repeat material so there are some sections in the book that are redundant. However it's worthwhile for any Bill Hicks fan or anyone that appreciates intelligent humor with a point of view to purchase.
3,Somewhat Misleading,"I thought this was going to be more autobiographical. It is mostly transcripts from his shows throughout the country and much of the material is repetitive. Although much of it is funny, Bill's stand-up material is better to be seen or heard than read."
3,Bill Deserves Better,"I just finished this book. My main problem with it is this: about half the book is made up of transcripts of Bill's comedy routines. The same ones you have on CD. And without Bill's expert comic delivery, they just don't translate that well on the printed page. On the other hand, the letters and interviews offer a more intimate look at a sensitive, serious man. It would have been better to cut out the transcripts, and give us more of Bill's writings and unreleased stuff. On a technical note, the book apparently was never proofread; it is rife with misprints and errors. And many of the entries are not clearly identified. For instance, we learn that Bill wrote for The Nation, but are these the political articles that are included? It's not clear. Dispite being poorly executed, if you are looking for more insights into the mind of Bill Hicks, you will want this book. If you merely want to enjoy his comedy genius, get the new DVD instead."
3,Good but repetitive,"There is no doubt that Bill Hicks was a true comic genius. The writings of his contained in this book help to further illustrate this.Unfortunately, however, the bulk of the book is made up of transcripts of his comedy appearances (mainly from those recorded for CD). Whilst obviously not as good as seeing the man himself deliver the lines, reading them is enjoyable. Reading the same bit 5 times is less so. There is a tremendous amount of repetition in the routines, left in by the author in order to preserve the integrity of the monologues.As a result, the book is best read in small doses, so as to dissipate the effect. Trying to read it in large chunks means reading the same material again and again in short succession."
3,"Incredible material, poorly edited","The stories told by Hicks' friends and family surrounding the time of his death were inspiring to say the least, and this book would be great if not for the redundant bits that really should have been left out. The most insightful prose becomes a chore when you have to read it half a dozen times in the same book."
4,Zatoichi tries hard . . .,"What do you expect from a blind swordsman? The plot is a bit confusing, the girl pretty, Zatoichi clever, the swords sharp - what more do you want?"
5,"God""s Radar","This CD may fly under this world's radar, but it is a bright spot on God's radar. It is as foundational to what Christianity is as any Bible commentary I have ever read."
5,They still leave you thinking with the messages they sing,"I've been a Peter, Paul and Mary fan since their first concert I attended in high school in 1969. They always entertain you, but leave you thinking about our society. This is my favorite recording and Danny's Downs is an exceptional song. I have given this to many of my friends and will continue to."
3,Remembering,"I was disappointed in the selections on this CD. I have been an avid fan of Peter, Paul and Mary since the 60's. I thought there were better selections that would have supported the title of this CD. I still lovelistening"
3,"Great fun, even with some low quality material.","Some of the trailers are scratched up and look pretty bad, but some of themare in great shape, better than some of the ones ive seen. To all you50's to 60's creature / monster movie lovers, this should bring back somememories. I have all the movies mentionned in my collection, and its greatto see the trailers for them. This product received a 3 star due to theextra material....get this...they have some on the set stuff, when theywere filming the movie, the Land that Time Forgot. I was impressed.Good for multiple viewing..."
4,Uplifting,"This was an uplifting read for me of how these women integrated spirituality into their daily lives. I loved the peripheral characters too, and how their stories blended. Each main character had traits I could relate to myself."
4,chicago's answer to cannibal corpse,"Gorgasm is like a cross between cannibal corpse and suffocation.Killer riff work,and not just dual vokills, but three vocalists,kinda like Nile....pick this up!! its killer...sick....twisted...ect."
1,Why DM is branded negatively.,"No wonder death metal gets such stick as being a lowbrow genre when crap like this is being produced. A modern cannibal corpse, who in turn were a farcical band. The music has no substance, just simply exploiting the shock value of gory lyrics.Seriously, this is a disgrace to some of the bands in the genre who can push it's boundaries with exceptional music, eg Cryptopsy, Gorguts. Dont waste your money on this one-dimesional rubbish then maybe it will stop poisoning the scene."
3,Rubbery,"This parka is fine on a cold rainy day, maybe with a sweater underneath. Be aware that it is very rubbery. Also, although it does have vents for ventilation, on a warm day it will be very hot, and you will sweat under it."
3,Pretty generic YA fantasy quest,"This latest uninspired quest-type fantasy effort in the YA market is practically indistinguishable from others of its type. Pattou's predictable writing lacks the insight and liveliness of Lloyd Alexander, the depth and creativity of C.S. Lewis, the humor and zaniness of Patricia C. Wrede, the thorough world-building of Garth Nix and Philip Pullman and the beautiful prose of Robin McKinley. There are plenty of much better YA fantasy authors out there-- leave this one on the shelf unless you haven't read a lot of fantasy or have a thing for generic fantasy-quest types."
2,A non-descriptive book with an unexciting but original plot,"This book, about a boy who goes on a quest to look for his kidnapped sister, has an original plot, but did not hold my interest for long, and I found that the plot did not really develop. Also, the book moved to quickly, and was very non-descriptive. But, if you are someone who wants to read something in a short amount of time, you might like this book. It is an easy read, and, because of the lack of description, is a quick read."
4,Death Benefit VHS,"I was so excited that I was able to locate this old video on Amazon. This is the true story (of course, slightly different movie verses book account)of a murder that took place only a mile or two from where I live. The quality is about what you would expect from a fairly low budget video, but I am still quite pleased with the purchase. If someone ever wants to read a really interesting true murder book, I'd recommend they read the book and then possibly watch the video (if they can find a copy - I'm not lending mine out)."
1,record exec moonlighting as a singer,"Schmaltzy. . . I am trying to figure out why this merrits good reviews. The whole disc smacks of people in the biz trying to get on this guy's good side. He's a decent singer, but the arrangements are really overdone (even though one reviewer I saw said that he managed to keep it not too overdone). If you want a really good/different version of Mac the Knife look to the Kurt Weil's Lost in the Stars CD with Sting. I guess this really doesn't matter much because the disc is out of print."
1,"cute package, but contents drone","i thought this cd would be excellent, like those i have heard from other outstanding NYC djs like Dara or Reid Speed. unfortunately, it is not- in my opinion. the tracks selected are boring - played all together the way she does it. maybe each one alone might be tolerable, if juxtaposed with some more complex rhythms or some melody, vocals, anything! but it seems like one long boring clanking track all the way through. she attempts variation with track 2 but goes nowhere with it. i was extremely disapointed. no real melody or variation here, just unoriginal, unspirited dark middle of the road D&B."
3,Definitely not the WORST D'n'B artist around!,"There are many fine drum and bass artists in the world and no matter what someone tells you or a review tells you about Empress, she is awesome at what she does, though it is out of the ordinary. Empress's style is a bit on the tweeked side of drum and bass, which is not for the majority of jungle fans. She throws down a great little mix here for everyone to enjoy, though I am sure this mix is not the best I have ever heard from her. If you like female drum and bass, you should also look for Sage, Reid Speed, Miss K, and Dazee to quench your rinsing thirst."
1,Don't buy it,"This cd is not worth getting. The Empress doesn't give off the vibe that she started from the bottom of the drum and bass scene and worked her way up, and her music and mixing skills prove that. This cd starts off melodic, but it gets cheesy. The pitch is too high in certain points and for the songs that aren't meant to be played that way, it ruins it.If you want a good all around drum and bass cd, get Reid Speed's Resonance or DB's Secret Art of Science or any one of Dieselboy's cd's."
2,Service Ramps,"These ramps are nice if you need to conserve space as the ramp portion detaches. However when I drove my truck onto them the ramps bent nicely and they looked like a banana. My truck is a Chevy Silverado which weighs in total 7000 pounds. The ramp part doesnt seem to be handle 10,000 pounds or even 5000 pounds."
5,Aloha's Love Journey,"Hello Goodbye I love You, is a great book that interweaves the life of Diego Escobar and his family as they raise Aloha the guide puppy and the life of Kimberly Louise as she goes through some tragic events. It teaches that there are many challenges in life, but we can try hard and find ways to overcome them. I loved how the two stories were interchanged chapter by chapter, and Pam used great imagery! It felt like I was in the book, part of the story and knew Diego and his family!I could picture all the scenes because of the wonderful word choice she used and the story is so realistic to how life would be with a guide dog.The way that Pam pieced together the story couldn&#65533;t have been better. She did an overall magnificent job with the book.-Clara Baker"
2,A mush of sound from Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque,"This Erato recording is one of the mushiest and least distinct recordings of Bach's Easter Oratorio and Magnificat I have ever heard.The tone has been pitched to the half-step lower Baroque pitching which has been done before. That is not the problem.What is the problem is an Orchestra and Choir that fight itself in tempi,where bowing and enunciation is lost in a cacaphony of muck and mire.The Oratorio fares better than the Magnificat which this listener would never recommend to any serious listener.Stick with the Lausonne version.It is clear and crisp and not so frenetic.Not at all recommended."
1,The worst Lulu ever,"Evelyn Lear could make a fine Marina Mnsek for Boris, his voice is not for modern opera."
3,deep disco lovers,if u like FAZE ACTION of first carrer period you should appreciate that......HI LEVEL NU DISCO mixed with a touch of deepy house....for lovers of a LOW BPM with a great quality
5,It's a great album,"This is a great metal album for 1984. Not many people knew of the band in those days. The guitar tone is perfect. This and the Death Row e.p. are the only two jag panzer titles I own, but both are amazing considering when they were released. I would say they are to power metal what VIO-LENCE is to bay area thrash."
4,Great pair of binoculars,These Binoculars are good for the price. Pictures and video are of good quality. Once I figures out how to use it it was great.I highly reccomend.
1,Cheap looking,"What a disappointment this turned out to be. My first impressions were that it LOOKED very cheap...like a fisher-price toy. The $20 camera/binoculars look more sturdy than this $200 model. The instructions are awful, there's no technical support from the company. AND the unit I received didn't work. The camera lights up, but never shows a picture. I did manage to get a couple of pictures recorded to the memory card by 'guessing' and the picture quality is worse than my cell phone.I sure wish I had bought something ELSE for my husband for Christmas."
5,Exciting New Author,"I loved Kyoto Connection. I couldn't wait to get home from work to see what would happen next to Page and Kenji. Kemp has just the right blend of romance and intrigue in her writing. The author has done her homework.She has wonderful explanations of Japanese customs and vocabulary in her book.I can't wait to read her next book, Kiss of the Geisha."
1,Awful!,"This book is absolutely terrible -- so bad it must be self-published. I don't like to be unkind but I wasted the money on this book, hoping for a nice Japanese/American romance, and found it totally unreadable. Basic grammar and structure are ignored, and the whole thing is embarrassing. If Ms. Kemp wants to be a published author she really needs to learn how to write.Sorry, but it's so bad it's a rip-off."
2,Suburban fantasy,"This is the kind of writing that is viewed as exciting and profound only by women who live in the suburbs and view the world through that isolated lens. That said, I haven't read the book, but the excerpt was not good. It seems a typical pulpy romance novel so I suppose if you like that kind of stuff..."
5,An Wondrous Epic Fantasy Where Dreams Never Die,"There is a place where forgotten dreams live on and that place is Shadows Fall.Simon R. Green takes the reader on a wondrous journey of magic, fantasy and the fine line that divides reality and dreams. The story concerns a young man by the name of James Hart who returns to Shadows Fall where he once lived as a young boy seeking answers to unravel the mystery of his life. After his arival in the town he meets a legendary rock star by the name of Sean Morrison and a dead man walking named Leonard Ash.However something is very amiss in the town as people are slowly being murdered one by one. This would have to be one of my all time favourite books and it is the one I choose to take with me when I am on vacation. The book is a wondrous journey through a mythical town and the book works like the magic depicted in it. I could not put this book down and was lucky enough to be able to read it in one sitting."
3,Go for the Nightside books instead,"A couple of issues harm what could be a very good dark fantasy book. First, the editing is atrocious. I felt like I was reading a first draft. Typos abound, and a page was actually turned the wrong way in the binding. Completely inexcusable.Second, Mr. Green is known for extraordinarily long chapters. This is the type of book that needs to be picked up for a little light reading, but Green treats it like it was ""War and Peace"".Finally, and this is just a pet peeve of mine, why would an author put a quote from themselves on the front of the book, praising it? That is just bush-league right there. All in all this felt like I was reading a book published in an all night Kinko's. Read the Nightside series instead."
3,'Achoo!' Not!,"Did you ever have one of those moments where you felt a big sneeze coming on, and you sit there with teary eyes, head tilted back, body completely still and hand held outwards as to brace yourself for the anticipated, satisfying, climatic 'Achoo!' as the air explodes from out your lungs - and it never comes?That's how this book ends.Other than that I am a huge fan of Simon Green's Nightside and Secret History series. This book has it's merits but it's more of a tribute to a great author in progress."
5,Excellent world,"I was hesitant but really wanted things to read. And I was drawn in immediately. I was worried at one point if I would wish for a sequel, but for once he wrapped up a story in one book and it was excellent."
2,Great Ideas Went to this Town to Die,The ideas and concepts and even some of the characters were so fantastic that I was really upset when I realized that nothing was happening! The ending was completely unfulfilling and not at all unanticipated. Skip it!
5,Great knife,"I got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. It is small, light weight, sharp, and awesome quality. Can't really go wrong with a SOG. He carries it on his work belt and says that it has come in handy a lot. Shipping was quick too!"
3,Not great,"I was very surprised by this knife. This knife seems to be very poor quality, which is very different than what I have come to expect from SOG. I own several SOG's, a Flash II folder, a Seal 2000 elite, a Seal Pup elite, and a Full size pentagon. All are top quality. Not sure what SOG was thinking on this one. Blade is too thin, and seemed to be bent slightly when I got it. Just didn't care for it."
5,Soul Food Season Three,"A friend had loaned me his first and second season of Soul Food in December and within just a few episodes I was hooked on the series. Season Three is no different, it was an awesome season. After receiving my purchased I had the entire season within three weeks. I'm anxiously waiting for the Final Season of Soul Food. :) I recommend this African-American series to anyone who enjoys drama series.It will forever live on through DVD's. Highly suggest you watch the series!Thanks."
5,She loves it..,"I purchased this DVD for my sister, who is a ""HUGE"" Soul Food fan and she loves this DVD. Now she is waiting for season 4 to be released.."
2,"boring, boring, boring","this is the worst season of soul food by far. damon is haunted by his ex-girlfriend? bird gets the hots for her female colleague? lem hooks up with baron marks and learns that shade can go corporate as well as street?terrence howard is the only thing that saves these discs from closet purgatory. his portrayal of baller benny jones was enough to shake me out of a persistent doze-fest. this is also the worst TV show-to-DVD release by far. i agree with l. williams -- the editing will drive you crazy! why did paramount do this? how can they justify it? makes me wish i had taped the episodes when they aired... but even showtime displayed an evil sense of humor when they played repeats -- they mixed up the order, so if you were trying to create an at-home collection for yourself, it would have been all wrong. i'm crying foul."
1,Nice but............,This watch is very difficult to change the timing. My wife broke her nail attempting to do this. Also the strap broke after 3 weeks! I do not think I would buy another watch online.
2,Cute. Broke after 1st day of use.,"I love the simplicity of this chart for small children. My girls (3 and 4) were so excited when we ordered these. I ordered two charts and a few of the knobs ceased to work after the first 24 hours, rendering it useless. We hardly touched it. I wish this item was made of wood instead of this cardboard type material. It would also be nice if it came apart at the back just in case the knob/dial needed repair. As it is, you can't take it apart. I am throwing mine away, but I wish they worked because they are so simple and adorable."
5,"Fast, Simple, Quiet!","As the other reviewer said, this is absolutely a silent drive.Excellent plug & play set-up with Windows ME. No hassles at all.You can get this drive very cheap at Sams club ..."
3,battery problems,"This is a great driver, but one of the batteries failed after less than one year. I wish I had saved my receipt. I haven't seen any batteries in my local store where I bought the tool either. (Menard's)"
3,Great Tool: Could be Perfect,"Have all of the five Bosch 12 volt Li Ion Tools so have lots of spare charged batteries. Have other heavy duty drills and impact drivers for tough stuff, but my preference is to first use the Bosch tools. Bought the driver first about a year ago. Excellent light weight tool. Problem (perhaps this has been dealt with in more recent versions?) is that on drilling into wood and then retracting the drill bit, the drill bit often pulls out of the chuck - most often with the cheaper die cast shanks. The later 12 v angle drill with the same chuck type does not have this problem. Would be prepared to replace the defective driver if I knew the problem had been resolved: otherwise spend a little more and buy the chucked (more powerful, alas heavier) driver."
5,Great Tool!,"This Pocket driver feels great in your hands, has a solid construction and a locking bit driver. The torque is good and with a spare battery you will never lack power!"
3,Good but the upgrade is better,"This is a solid tool at a great price. My only complaint is the balance is slightly off and the handle is just too wide. I am 5'10"" average size and my hand isn't really big enough to grip the tool right. A smaller person/ woman would definitely find it uncomfortable. Ironically I found it more comfortable to use my middle finger on the trigger instead of my index finger.I upgraded toBosch CLPK27-120 12-Volt 2-Tool Combo Kitand it is worth the extra $80. The drill/driver is significantly more powerful, weighted better, and I find it more comfortable to hold. I do still think the handle is too thick but that is a function of the battery size and can't really be changed The impact driver is awesome and it comes with the newer 412 batteries (not that I know what differences that offers but newer is better I feel).Overall this is a good purchase but if you can afford it I really think the upgrade is worth the extra money and in the end is a much better investment"
4,Good product,"Works very well, batteries last a good while on the job.Only down side is that it is chuck-less and requires a special type of bit.I will use it for all my jobs that I can but I still have to use my chucked drill for the jobs I don't have the special bit for."
4,handy!,i bought this one as a gift for my dad to replace one he lost. He loved his last one and so this should live up to the same expectations.
2,Unimpressed,"I read the reviews that said it's a good little tool for light duty work. It's not in my opinion. The chuck sticks at times, the drill speed is way too slow. I would say it's a unitasker fit for people who want to use it to screw 2-3 screws into soft wood. If you have a lot of work to do, get a more powerful drill."
3,Lots of trouble with batteries,"I purchased my first Bosch cordless tool on 5/12/2009 and my experince has not been very good. One of the two original batteries failed so Bosch gave me two new replacement batteries. One of the new ones then failed so they sent me a third replacement. Now a third battery has failed. So out of five batteries total, three have failed. They are going to send me yet another battery for a driver that is only 15 months old. I wouldn't buy this tool again."
5,Best tool in my collection,This is by far my favorite tool that I own. It is incredibly powerful. Bits lock in place so they are unable to pull/fall out. The lithium ion batteries last a really long time and will last even if you do not use the driver for a long period of time. I also own the Skil version of this and it is night and day. Spend the extra money and you will not be disappointed.
2,Chuck not as good as 10.8V Pocket Driver,"I like everything *except* the new chuck.It does not hold the bits I use.I have several, older, 10.8V Pocket Drivers I have been using with no problems. I had high hopes for the two, new, 12V Pocket Drivers I just purchased, but would not buy another until this problem is fixed."
4,Best value for the dollar,"Purchased this drill to replace my 12+ year Makita cordless drill. Works just great. Only problem - didn't realize it ONLY takes quick-change (hexagon shank) bits. I had already purchased the adapter for all my other drills (corded & otherwise), those that let me use my older regular (round shank) bits. And finding individual quick-change bits locally is impossible on this Island. And needless to say, buying through Amazon is clearly the way to go!"
4,Bosch PS20,light and very handy. I was looking for this a long time. Great Price. The Battery last a very long time.
3,Great for the price,"Got 3 of these on one of the deals of the day. Good little drill for home projects and light assembly, but it doesn't have much torque. The similar Ridgid 12V costs more, but is a lot better drill.Again, I'm glad to get these at the special deal price, but probably won't order more."
5,"Bosch drill, drills it",Does what I want it to do. Use in my TV repair business and my work projects assembling projects for the home. Powerfull enought for what I have to do. Excellent investment.
2,Save your money!,"It's hard to buy a gift for your husband, but I know Bosch is considered a good brand, and this little lithium battery powered driver/drill had good reviews. Based on the positive reviews I bought this plus the Titan bit set as a gift for Christmas. Big mistake! If you want to draw circles to decorate a wall, you could dip the end of the bit in wet paint and make great little circles...but don't try to drill any holes! This can't hold a bit straight no matter what you do. Tried different chucks in it too, and even took it to a tool store for advice, but they just said there was nothing that could be done to make it work well. A big waste of money. Apparently it can still drive screws, but what a lot of money to spend for a screwdriver!"
2,For this price you would think...,"You'd think they include a holster which is more useful than the soft box it comes with. I have a holster for my other tools, but this one is a bit small and falls out. The carrying case is a nice touch but not useful on the job."
2,NOT AN IMPACT DRIVER,"This item came back in the search results for an impact driver. However the item description does not call it an impact so it is not totally misleading. Its a good little driver, but I would not have paid this much for it if I hadnt thought it to be an impact driver."
3,Slowness shows when drilling,"I like this driver very much and got a nice deal on Amazon. It works perfect as a driver. It is capable of being used as a drill too. I just wish I had taken a closer look at the RPMs on it. This model tops out at 300 RPM, where there are a couple of very similarly sized drills that go up to 1500 RPM (they are also more than twice as expensive). That speed makes a big difference when drilling. I guess that gives me a reason to add another tool to the chest :)"
3,Works OK,"This pocket driver works okay, but is very slow. Has good power, light weight, runs sufficiently long on one charge. The only draw back is its speed."
5,exactly the same as the 9.8v,The Bosch line is great. I have all the 9.8v tools and this one is no diffrent. It's exactly the same tool as the 9.8. In fact you can use the battries an charger in either one.The 12v rating is just a sales gimmick to make you think it's new. Still a great tool.
3,one of battery can not be ccharged,I got this drill and evrything working accsept one battery can not be charge.can you send me other battery. thanks
1,works great until they get cold,"Great tool as long as they do not get cold.. When cold they will not work until you warm them up, I own 3 of them and they are all the same. So when it is cold we depend on a 6 year old metabo"
4,DKNY Women's Black Leather Watch #3391,Really like the watch. The leather wasn't as black as I thought it would be because of the texture but with ware it has smoothed out and I'm really happy with the purchase.
3,Seductive torture,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Leguin. The pun/premise of this book is provocative, but the individual sections are so brief that they seem like experiments in setting up the complex cultures for which she is rightly renowned. There's just not enough room for the contextual stories to evolve as we've learned to love from her. I hope she'll develop at least some of them further."
3,Good But Not Outstanding,"This is a collection of sketches based on the clever conceit that bored airplane travelers can move from tedious airports to parallel worlds (planes). Each of the stories is a sketch of some key feature of the plane being visited. Several of the stories have a bit of an allegorical flavor, some are mildly satirical, and others feature interesting psychological issues. LeGuin is an extremely talented writer and several of these stories are very enjoyable and all are worth reading. None of these stories, however, comes close to LeGuin's best work. For readers familiar with LeGuin, this is something of a disappointment. Readers new to LeGuin who find this book enjoyable should pursue the LeGuin's older collections of stories, particularly those written 20 to 30 years, such as Orsinian Tales or the Compass Rose."
4,Insightful commentary on human life,"The title is quite clever: the book contains the author's accounts of travel to other planes of reality, and - more particularly - the inhabitants of these other worlds. Some of them are quite disturbing, but - like all good Science Fiction - they provide a great vehicle for commentary on human life.For example, one of the stories concerns the Ansarac, who travel south for the winter. One of their years, however, is the equivalent of about 24 of our years, and so these people make only two or three of these migrations in their lifetimes. It's a long journey, and an important event.But then the Bayderac, visitors from another plane, came and told the Ansarac that they were being controlled by animal impulse, and should instead build highways and aeroplanes so that they could make the trip many times a year..."
3,Good for waiting,"Ursula K. Le Guin's Changing Planes was somewhat of a homecoming for me, as I've read little speculative fiction lately. I have always enjoyed her style, and this book was no exception.On the darker side, the introduction bills this as a good airport book (changing planes -- get it?), and its construction as a travelogue, combined with the relatively light-weight stories, bear that out."
2,Review of Used Book,"I know the book is a used paperback, and didn't expect it to be perfect, but I don't consider the condition to be sellable. The binder was very worn, and page had become completely separated! It was just loose, stuck into the place where it should have been attached."
5,EMOTIONALLY MOVING,"Everything you expect. Without even understanding the words, the sentiment & emotion are apparent. If, like me, you think the CD may be monotonous, you couldn't be farther from the truth. 'Blessed' runs the gamut from soulful to playful, but usually quite emotional and uplifting. It's one of those CDs you can listen to straight through."
5,a rare treat for writers,"Beautifully written and full of real insight, this astonishing little book will do more for the creative flow of aspiring writers than most books in the field. Its focus is on children's writing, and it offers the wisdom of an outstanding and very succesful author. Her love of children's writing is contagious, her advice is sound, and this excellent help will inspire many generations to come. In a league of its own."
2,But we are not children...,"gee, I bought this book to help me learn to write for children, not to be talked down to by the author...which is what happened. A shoddy, simplistic, overly ""this is how I believe it to be"" approach that lacks the the clarity and educational value I was looking for when I purchased it. Dated examples and poor type face and formatting doesn't help. I'd avoid this one."
1,Snoozefest,"If you're looking for something worthwhile on Roman entertainment, search for ""Paul Plass.""If you're looking for something on Roman theaters, search for ""Margaret Bieber.""If you want a book that scrambles together the research of a horde of other scholars along with untrustworthy translations and a poor understanding of them, then by all means buy this book. No wait, don't do that. Look for it in your local library, then you'll thank me."
2,Cute Shoe--not true to size!,"This shoe is as cute as can be, but seems to run about 1/2 size or more too small. Not sure if this typical of Sugar Shoes, but I won't be trying any more of them by internet until I've tried them on in person."
5,Gorgeous Watch,"This watch is quite attractive, sylish and very comfortable to wear. It goes with all my wardrobe no matter what type of social/working environment I may be attending. Thank you Amazon for the quality of your products."
4,Good and fair customer service.,I had a problem with one of the two watches I purchased. Chelsea fixed the problem to my satisfaction. Five ***** for customer service.
4,"Great watch, unique band!","My wife loved this watch! The band was unique in the clasp, leather band combination. Great gift and good price."
2,"ok board, lousy pre-amps","I was trying to use this as a portable board, but the pre-amps are less than to be desired. I had to crank them all the way up just to get a usable level, and they have a weird gain jump at the end of their range, makes it very hard to set your levels. The in and out of the computer was good, just be aware that only the gain changes the level going in to the computer, and the channels are always sent to the computer no matter the settings of the board. It says 10 in and I guess that is technically true, but two of your ins are just the stereo main mix. It also has 10 channels out just know that 2 of these channels are dedicated to either the headphone or monitor output. It is nice that you can route back 8 channels to the board and use them in the mix as well, and you still get your inputs to the computer. Over all if you where using this in a studio with some pre-amps in front of the board. I think it would be ok."
1,unusable with garage band,"Using the firewire input I ALWAYS get popping on any of the MIC inputs. The popping is variable and it may have something to do with the driver software, but I have been unable to isolate the cause. Ive swapped cables and went back to using my ONYX 8. while the NRV 10 is lauded as a great live mixer it is UNUSABLE with garage band OSX 10.6.8 if you are using the firewire input. Would change this review is I can resolve this issue"
1,Piece of junk.,"I give this mic stand one star, only because I am not allowed to give it zero stars. The components are cheap plastic, and break easily. Waste of money."
3,Could be better,"Alright for cleaning out seeds of peppers, but the small end that looks like a tomato corer feels as if it will snap off if when you use it as such. It's worth the 3 stars because of price, but I would recommend spending a little more and getting something of all metal construction."
1,NURSING BOARDS REVIEW,THIS BOOK WAS PURCHASED USED IT WAS VERY OUTDATED- SOME OF THE INFORMATION WAS - OBSOLETE- HAD TO PURCHASE AN UPDATED VERSION- MAKE SURE WHEN OLD BOOK IS SOLD- DATE IS VERIFIED.
3,good and bad,Whats good about this book is it gives you a range of blender game creation learning from beginner level to advanced. There are heaps of screen shots showing various steps in a lesson. Whats bad are some of the screen shots.In the 3D modelling section on making a car there are several screen shots. Looking at them it's near on impossible to spot a difference between them. They properly looked fine in colour but in black and white it's hard to see the vectors mentioned.It's a shame someone didn't see this before printing as the content of the book is good but beginners do need clear illustrations.As a beginner to blender and 3d game making I'm still glad I bought the book. There's a heap of good stuff.
3,Not good for learning Blender,This books is in no way good to learn blender.You need the Guide Book or Learn from online tutorials.This books runs right through how to make games with blender and teaches very little on how to model.
1,Not your dream of Game Design,"Synopsis:Disregarding python script as a minor typic, this books is a magazine description of GE less informative than wikipedia."
2,"looks great, keeps bad time","I paid $236 for this watch and it kept good time for about 2 weeks. After that the time was off by more than 4hrs, and the date was off also. The list price seems very inflated. I returned the watch and will not be buying another Stuhrling."
5,A must for every Owl City Fan,"You absolutely must own this DVD if your a true Owl City Fan. I went to this concert and it was absolutely the best concert I have ever been to. The atmosphere was amazing, the music was amazing. What more can I say other than BUY THIS DVD !!!!"
2,This was terrible,"I had Classical Thought in East Asia as an undergrad. This book is truly the most awful textbook I've ever had to read. And we had to read the whole thing. The one other review for this calls it nearly unreadable. I could not agree more. I barely learned a thing because it is so intense. I was not able to concentrate on it because it just went on and on about every single detail. I'm not a poor reader. I'm not a poor student. I'm not unable to understand dense scholarly writings and books. This book was just awful. On the upside it's incredibly thorough (obviously) and well researched. If this is your area or specialty, go for it. Otherwise, walk away."
3,Solid (in Every Sense) Work,"This is a very well-researched, scholarly work. It is also incredibly dense to the point of being unreadable. If you're a graduate student in Chinese Lit or Lang (or going to be one), it's probably worth the investment. If you're not, this isn't the book for you."
3,Good Textbook,"This was a textbook for a hydrology course, it's an easy read, even for the non-hydrologist/ geographer. Lots of good exercises and suggestions for in-field experiments."
4,Entertaining murder mystery,"I enjoyed this book. Actually have been watching a British TV series based on this and other books in the series. Wonder if small villages in England are really like this -- murder, sex with whomever, etc. Entertaining and fast read."
4,The Killings at Badger's Drift.,"This is of course the book which was part of the inspiration for the TV series 'Midsummer Murders'. Having seen the TV series I could not help but be influenced by the characters as depicted on TV and at times they did not seem to match those depicted in the book for me. However, putting that aside, this was a good read and any reader completely new to this story should find it hard to put down before the end."
5,A Quintessential British Mystery,"The Killings at Badger's Drift is an excellently written, well-plotted British mystery. The setting is quaint, the characters are colorful, and the ending was a surprise. I personally love reading the musings of Sergeant Troy, Barnaby's unlikely assistant. His overly critical, insecure thoughts contrasts nicely with Barnaby's rational style, although Barnaby himself has his interesting quirks as well. If you are a fan of British mysteries, this is a must read!"
3,"A great video, but not the best","This video is pretty good but it does get a little boring sooner or later (in my opinion). If you are a true fan to it's genre, you would probably really enjoy this."
4,Wonderful Anime!,"I liked this anime, I saw it a couple years ago, when I was like 12 and it really freaked me out, but now that I see it again I really like it! It's really cool, at times it's kinda freaky and I don't recomend it for anyone under 12 or 13 because the monsters will scare little kids. [When I saw it the first time when I was younger it gave me nightmares] At the time I didn't know it was by Rumiko, one of my favorite Manga Artists, and I still liked it! Check it out!"
5,Born Into Brothels. Great Soundtrack.,"5 Stars. Rich. Recommended. If you're looking for something other than corporate canned crap, this is for you. And keep looking for equally beautiful music, here and abroad."
3,Born into Brothels (Sound track from DVD),Have enjoyed listening to this. I make a habit of buying music in a country when visiting but when in India I never got the chance. Do not regret my decision to purchase this CD.
3,whimsical history,"This is the first (to my kowledge) attempt to write a serious history of lace and lacemaking. It is an enjoyable read with many lovely illustrations. Do be warned, however, that there is some rather whimsical history between these pages studded amongst the accurate bits. Still, there is much good information in this book, and a wealth of wonderful illustrations."
1,CAN'T READ IT!,It's an OCR copy & A BAD COPY at that. Could be interesting but you'll never be able to get thru it to tell...
4,This'll charm you down to the bottom of your socks!,"Will Owsley brings a boyish exuberance to his music making (his death-defying, sockfooted guitar leap on the cover of this CD is a good demonstration) and songs like ""Oh No, the Radio"" and ""Good Old Days"" are sheer, unadulterated delight. You sense the same sort of bouncy, tuneful joy in his work that you feel in the early Beatles recordings. Owsley could be a little more mature, but then again, since when did boyishness ever disqualify you from being a rocker?"
4,Interesting!!,"Are you a fan of the Christian band PFR? How about XTC? Or Jellyfish? Then give this guy a listen! He is ALL about hooks! I have been looking for that ""ear ticklin"" sound since Jellyfish disbanded years ago. I really like power pop and have bought about 10 power pop cd's in the last month or so looking for that Jellyfish replacement. Well, no one has matched them, but Owsley comes real close to providing that fix. Just about every song gets you ""hooked"" and will get you humming along. He's really a good musician/writer and his songs with alot of really tight harmonies. One weird thing though is that I think he uses alot of pitch correction (melodyne?). You can hear that flat response that sounds unnatural in a couple places on the cd (I'm Allright, for one). I don't think he needs it, but evidently he does. Anyway, you can get this cd used for a couple bucks, and it's well worth it if you're into power pop!"
4,Well Crafted and Fun,"Owsley fills a void, a hole so big I get overwhelmed just thinking about it. This space I'm referring to is called ""Radio Music"" and the problem is that today the Radio is owned by corporate America and so now the channel line-ups on the FM side consist of RAP, Classic Rock, and Boy band / Girl band hyphen Soul R&B schlock and a fair sample of corporate Country ... A few rare individuals have cracked this pre-cast formula to make just the smallest little dent in the army of preconceived band concepts and music factory super slick poster product shoveled out in quantities previously inconceivable. If you purchase this CD (and you should) you place yourself in a small but very special group of music listeners much like the guy in that movie ""The Matrix"" that knew something wasn't right..."
3,Good Servicable Beatlesque Pop,"Okay, the title sums it up for me - this album is full of catchy hooks, but fair-to-middling lyrics. Good for popping in the hi-fi to get your day off to a bouncing little start, but not a classic. I will be interested in follow-ups, though."
3,"Catchy, But Forgettable.","After first picking up this album, I enjoyed it a lot. Owsley is a skilled guitar player and his voice and melodies and songs are all decent. And the album is beautifully recorded. But after a few listens, I was bored... and I don't know why exactly, but something is missing. It could be the lyrics, which don't seem to say anything worthwhile. Or it could be his voice which doesn't really connect emotionally. Anyway, I've parked the CD on the shelf and don't have any plans to play it again."
2,Another Beatles Wanna-Be Band,"I bought this hoping for some good rock/pop but instead got some dork rock that tries too desperately to imitate The Beatles. The songs aren't downright horrible, but the lead singer sounds like a dork and as far as Beatle-esque bands, I've heard many better ones."
4,Really good,"I bought this album yesterday because the description of him sounding good and it mentioned Ben Folds. This album is a really good pop album, plain and simple. Although Owsley doesn't come close to the songwriting skills of Ben Folds, it's an impressive debut anyway"
4,Perky and pleasant and great even for the oldsters.,"My ears really took notice when I first heard this music featured on the tv show, ""Charmed"". I knew I definitely wanted to hear ""Zavelow House"" again, so off I went to the bookstore, hoping to like more of it than just the one song. Well, I love the first seven tracks immensely! but after that, it tends to lose engergy for me. However, it's still a HIT rather than a MISS for this 45-yr old. ""Zavelow House"" is just *the best* song on the entire CD, altho I cannot seem to get the chorus from ""On the Radio"" out of my head. It's a sticker that I find myself humming at all sorts of odd moments. Great stuff!"
4,"It is fresh, punch, and has depth.","I grew up with owsley in Anniston,Al. He has always been very talented. This CD is the essence of Bill. Quick, thought provking and fun.I agree the first song, "" Oh No The Radio"" has radio potential, like most of the disc. There is definately a strong Beatles influence, as well as Cheap Trick, and Rainbow. Owsley's touring with Amy Grant was a huge factor in his profssionalism. Buy it today. Great investment."
3,Coming Up Bored,"There's no mistake about it: the Owsley family is a talented bunch. However this self-titled set does not always assert the same. With vocals on the Owsley's catchiest single, ""Coming Up Roses,"" sounding like a watered down Lennon, this album falters. There are a few gems on this album, including ""Good Old Days,"" a peaceful reverie of the past. But, overall, the album's arrangement suffers from repetition and drone vocals, rendering it all a mixed bag."
5,This cd is very touching. I loved it!,"The cd is great. I love the song ""Coming Up Roses"" It's kickin! The songs are very touching. I instantly fell in love with every song! I can't wait until he comes out with a new cd! He's extremely talented, and I admire his hard work. You'll love the cd!"
3,Home Buying without the spell/grammar check?!?!?!,"While this book does list some unique items that are not listed in other home buying books, it lacks in the grammar area.I do like how the book is formatted (easy to read) and the grouping of web-links at the end of each section is invaluable. I also appreciate the light that the author sheds on the real estate game and what some people will try to do to dupe you out of your money.On the other hand, I would hate for my child to pick up this book and to think that adults are in general this lacking in grammar skills.There are multiple instances of the misuse of there/their/they're and many occurances of nonsense sentences due to the editor not reading this book thoroughly (using 'off' instead of 'of'). There are also sentences in this book that change verb-tense mid sentence.Maybe that's why the type is so big. Maybe the author/editor are assuming that you'll read the book so fast that you won't catch any of their typos..."
5,Great Book!: Gives advice other books don't.,"This book is one of several that I have read on home buying. Although all good books on a specific subject will have overlap of information, Mr. Thornton reveals many additional facts and advice that the others don't. Also, it is an easy, quick-to-read yet comprehensive book printed in large type. I have much more confidence going out into the home buying market all by myself now. --Marsha"
5,Explore 'n Play,"My son LOVES, LOVES, LOVES this toy and so do I. This is a very easy toy for young children to operate. I have experienced w/ all the toys we have, that if my son can't get them to play music or do something easily he would move on to another toy. This toy has kept him occupied for a long time and I don't know what I would do w/o it. I am considering buying this as part of a baby shower gift b/c the big hit w/ our son and several friends' kids."
5,Fun toy,Ever since my son could sit up and play he has loved this toy. He'll play the sounds/songs over and over. It is very durable and has stood up to his banging it around. He is over a year old now and still plays with it. Good value for your money.
4,good musics,"My 4 monthes old baby can not play this toy by himself yet. But he has shown his interest in the musics and mimic animal sounds already. Everytime when I play this toy to him, he was attracted..."
3,Loud and annoying,"I gave this toy 3 stars, because my son (14 months) seems to like playing with it. However, there is no volume control and it is very loud! I had to take it to grandma's so I didn't have to hear it over and over. There are other great singing toys out there that aren't as loud and will entertain just as well."
3,disappointed,"I returned this toy as soon as I got it. I purchased it as a new item from Amazon, but it came looking very used. It was dirty in spots and looked worn down. Had is come in the new condition it should have, I would have kept it and given it to my nephew as planned. Since I packaged it up to return in about 15 minutes, I didn't get a chance to explore to see how fun and durable it would've been."
5,I love this!,"I love this toy for my son! I had picked it up in the store for him to play with while shopping with no intention of buying... well! he loved it so much and it kept him so quiet that I had to buy it. This toy is easy to use and easy to understand for little ones. My son barks everytime he hears the doggy. I had no problem with how loud it was, this toy is adorable!"
4,ok toy,"My son is 10 months old and only plays with this toy for a few minutes at a time. I agree that it's good for his little hands and would work well as a car toy. However, even though he does like it, he doesn't find it extremely exciting and it doesn't engage him for very long."
3,Play Center,I bought this for my nephew. He doesn't really play with it alot because he has so many bigger items that light up etc but when we are in the vehicle this is just the right size for him to play with it in his car seat.
4,Star One,This episode represents the end of the Blake's reign and shows us that Avon plans on taking the ship for his own after the Federation is destroyed. The trouble for the crew isthis.... Blake isn't standing in his way.
4,Interesting,Definitely a strange and thought provoking film. The book is much more terrifying---especially for young teens. I had excellent quality on my television when I streamed it. The animation was excellent!
5,A fun adventure,"Truly enjoyed this movie,was fun for the whole family.The animation was excellent and the storyline fun and different.GET IT!"
5,Coraline,My kids select this movie every time I ask what do you want to watch there is just something about it that makes you want to watch it over and over again. Makes a great halloween movie for kids.
5,"You say Carol, I say Coral","I'm a very, very big lover of the ""Corpse Bride"" animated film. And I AM biased in favor of all things Burton-styled (though not by him). Still, I sort of apporached this one with a little hesitation just because from the cover, I though I was getting Beetlejuice meets Pipi-Longstockings. For those of us who like Burton's wry and dark humor from his own works, while not as dark here until you get deeper into the movie, still I really hafta admit I warmed to the Coraline character pretty fast. In short, a fun-fun movie and feel-good in a gothy sort of way. I am in no way, sorry I purchased and will pull it down to watch often over time."
5,Stop action was superb,One must appreciate the superb animations resulting from stop action frame by frame manipulation of characters and props. The use of fiber optics was very creative.
1,No very good at all.,"I couldn't hear the movie very well so I had to go back and rewind it many times but it would get even worse. The picture was blurry and most of the time, I didn't even know what they were saying! This happens all the time when I buy movies from Amazon all the time!"
2,Weird and not my type of animated movie!!!,"I watched this movie, and it was creepy to say the least. It is not my type of animated movie however. I thought all of Tim Burton's works were lame. I am more impressed with the animation work in Alvin And The Chipmunks, Ice Age, and Shrek.These movies had less sinister plots, and were good enough for the entire the family. Coraline isn't one of those movies that most parents would want their children to watch. I guess it's one of those movies that you either really like, or don't like."
2,DVD flipsided,The movie is just about perfect(4 and half stars). Picture and sound are both great. BUT!!! Both the single disc version and the double disc version are flipped disc(Dual sided). I find this unacceptable.
3,Not for Children,"Be warned this is a creepy film with some disturbing images for younger eyes (and some older!). Very well done no doubt, but very creepy. Should not be viewed by younger children. After viewing was surprised it wasn't rated PG-13 or even R."
5,c'est fantastique,Top notch fantasy story in 3-D Stop Action Animation is deceptively simple. Shot like a live action film and powerful as a visual and aural experience. Through the looking glass concept fresh and engrossing. Perfect for adults of all ages. It's amazing that 'stop-action' continues in this digital world but the two work together for this sublimely creepy and fun film. 3-D is great for home format. 2-D is like 3-D. BD is awesome A/V. Dig copy has DVD and 3-D. 8 Glasses. You might not think you want it; I didn't and flipped when I experienced it. Good work.
2,hated it,"Not sure what all the excitement is about.Who was this for? It's far too scary to be a kids' movie; not scary enough to be an adults' movie, and it gets off to an awfully slow start, with many unnecessary characters.And it was just to trippy, too dreamy. I know it comes from a book, and it probably works better as a book. The relentlessly surreal sequences toward the end got to be too much."
2,NOT family friendly,"I have to say, we watched this with our children, 5 and 7 and I was disappointed with the lack of family friendliness of this movie. I thought it was too scary for a PG movie and didn't like the heavy chested, lack of clothing part of the movie with little kids. Thought that was a bit much. We have seen so many other animated movies like this, but I was disappointed and a bit shocked by some of the content of this movie, from a parents perspective. I would have not let my kids see it if I would have watched it in advance! Perhaps older children would be fine but mine were definitely freaked out by it and afraid to go to bed."
1,Coraline AWESOME. this version- suck,"my review is about this particular set since Coraline is an excellent film and in blu-ray is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! however, i bought this version with the digital copy in mind (trying to stay on the legal side) and universal, unlike other companies who have extended the valid dates for their digital copies, are not so nice about it. customer support was completely unhelpful jovially saying thanks! but providing no alternative for the digital copy aspect of this set for which i paid. highly disappointed in this version and universal's inability to work with the consumer."
2,Gruesome,"I guess I am too old for this. I hated it. The animation is ugly and the terrors are stupidly unrealistic. There is hardly anything to feel compassionate about. Are we glad she went back home and her busy parents gave her gloves she wanted? Worse yet - I bought this DVD and the book -- and have ordered the doll -- and then watched with my grandchild who is struggling with her parents' divorce (after I consulted several sources concerning its appropriateness). I am going to read the book, however and see if the author can be redeemed. If this is what kids want, there is a worse future ahead of them."
2,Not Gaimen's Coraline,"I read the book first, and it is much better than the movie. I don't know why the movie made the parents so mean. In the book, they work from home, but they aren't hateful to her when she asks questions. There are also several unnecessary changes that make the story less interesting. Why change the painting over the fireplace and then make it less interesting? Why does the other dad play piano? The other parents are creepy because they are always waiting for Coraline and don't seem to have any other purpose but to give her their undivided attention, which makes them very creepy when you realize they are always watching her and waiting, but you don't know what they are waiting to do. Coraline is suspicious of the other parents right away and everything is darker in the other world. The movie has none of the sense of setting and foreboding of the book.Read the book if you want a more interesting and scary story."
5,Cute and Scary,"I thought this movie was cute, the story was great and it was a great illustration to the book. My husband thought it was scary."
4,Great Movie,I really enjoyed the book and this is also a great movie. Definitely worth the purchase. I'd recommend it to anyone.
2,took forever and 3d doesn't work,"I ordered this video on 9/30 and it didn't arrive until 10/25 or so. This was within the designated time frame advertised, but I received notice that it could arrive as soon as 10/9. When it got here, the 2D works fine, but the 3D doesn't work on the specific scenes that look best in 3D. Very disappointing."
5,Great thriller movie for older kids & adults!,"My daughter & I saw this when it came to the theaters in 3D. When this came out, we had to have it as we could watch this movie over & over & never get bored, it's that good.My daughter & I have read both the graphic novel of the book & the regular book.This is a great movie adaptation of the novel.Neil Gaiman seems to understand abuse & it's terrible consequences.The film delves into the MO of controllers...the vulnerability of the victim.To me, this story goes way beyond a child's fantasy horror story..I saw the real world in it.Entertaining & frightening.This 2-Disc collector's edition has some fascinating looks at how the film was made that was really great.I would recommend this set overall. Very good!"
3,creepier than I expected,"This was a weird movie. Started off pretty slow, then got really weird, and potentially could frighten young children. It was interesting when it got going and is definately worth a show with teenagers+. Rent first."
3,This 3D is useless,"I love the movie, don't let the 3 stars mislead you there. The film is wonderful. And the 2D blu-ray looks great. But as others have said, the 3D is an insult. The depth looks halfway decent, but the colors... wow, the colors with those 3D glasses make the film completely unwatchable. One of the most disappointing purchases I've made in quite a while because of that. Had they let us know on the box what it really was, I'd have been ok with that, as opposed to the promise of a 3D experience that, well, sucks."
3,SO SCARY FOR KIDS,"As with many of these movies, they aren't really made with kids in mind. But this one is especially creepy and scary. I was scared and anxious during most of the movie and my kids were wide-eyed and confused. They watched it 'till the end (they're 3 and 6) because they insisted on it and they haven't had nightmares for now but I really wish I hadn't bought it. It's much too dark and crazy and deformed..."
3,Rattling DVD case,"I got my dvd in good time. When opening the case for the first time the dvd was not clicked into place right, so the dvd was rattling around the case. The dvd seemed undamaged, but the seller should keep an eye on this for future shipments."
3,Good Kitty,"""Coraline"" is a hanselly-gretelly tale of a preteen girl discovering that perfect parents and an egocentric world is not reality, leaving something to be grateful for in that imperfect-but-true family. Reminiscent of Henry Selick's other films like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" in the sewing of buttons and body parts of dolls, it's not as dark as Gil Kenan's ""Monster House,"" but still has that eery, juvenile flavor. The soundtrack music in ""Coraline"" is beautiful and stirring. One of the key characters, though unrecognized at first, is the clever and shifty black cat."
4,Coraline is creative; loved the 3-D!,"The movie was very creative as is always the case with Tim Burton's work. It had a few slow parts but basically it held my interest from beginning to end. The 3-D element was great! I wish more DVDs would have this feature in their package options. Sometimes after watching a movie, I don't care to see it again. I definately will watch this one several times."
3,OK... but not great,Cute Burton movie... but not his best by any means. The 3-D was nauseating & we had to flip the disc after 15 minutes & watch the regular widescreen version instead.
5,Lonely Girl,"I'm a huge fan of this type of animation. I like it better than the CGI stuff. As usual, Tim Burton casts u in a fantastic magical world. I would have rather had the voices in Coraline British, rather than English, it would have made the film a bit more mystical and intelligent sounding. The plot was a bit confusing, you really have to pay attention. I was more fixated on the beautiful, organic animation and vivid colours. Coraline, Nitemare b4 X-mas, James and the Giant Peach and Corpse Bride are all fantastic films. I hope they continue to make these types of films, the time they spend to make them is worth it."
3,Creepy!,"I'm a 30 year old woman and even to me, this movie is creepy! It's good in that it teaches kids not to go off on their own and not to disobey parents. However it teaches these lessons in such a morbid way.The stop animation was good and it was creative. It kind of reminds me of a Tim Burton movie. Was this from Tim Burton?I would rate this a 3.5/ 5 stars"
2,Interesting watch,"This is a nice animated movie but nothing more. Tries to be a bit scary at times. A child of poor parents fantasizes about nice meals, clothes and such. As a result, she is drawn more and more into this fantasy world. She will escape and will return to her real parents."
3,Looks amazing!,"Awesome visuals dominate this movie, but I wasn't totally enthralled with it. The lead character of Coraline wasn't really all that nice, and it was hard to cheer for her, or even like her very much. I thought the only standout character was the 'Other Mother', voiced by Teri Hatcher (who oddly enough did the real mother as well, but that was less interesting to me)."
4,"Great movie, but disappointing 3D with this set.","I really enjoyed this movie, but I am disappointed with the 3D.This gift set does NOT come with a Blu-Ray 3D movie; it comes with a Blu-Ray that uses Anaglyphic 3D. Some reviews rave about the 3D of this movie, but they must have had a different set because this only come with the Anaglyphic kind of 3D (with the colored glasses), not the Stereoscopic kind. I searched to try and find a definitive answer as to what kind of 3D came in this set and found very little information, so I decided to order it and give it a shot. If you are looking for a REAL 3D Blu-Ray movie, this gift set is not for you."
3,Coraline Awesome,"This movie is totally awesome. Very imaginative, good classic story, and wonderful cinematography. The look of this movie is as awesome as the way they made it, check out the special features. Really cool. The reason I gave this product 3 stars was because the 3D version is not so great. The glasses aer the old 2 color glasses and my eyes, and others who have watched it, never quite adjusted all the way. The 3D became distracting actually. In the movie theater the 3D was amazing!!! I was blown away by its awesomeness! But the transition to home 3D is not quite there yet. But still an awesome movie. I'd suggest just buying the regular version of the movie, its kinda ""3D ish"" anyway."
5,"Back home, cats don't talk","Sinfully inspired and darkly delivered, the story is wonderful, the art and animation are divine. As Gaiman is well known to pen creepy childrens' stories, this one renders wonderfully as a moving picture. In a decidedly grim parallel, Coraline goes down her own rabbit hole, to find that predictable, boring life with her parents isn't so bad. The story is one I definitely will enjoy watching repeatedly.However, the 3D version of this film at home was a lackluster experience. The perspective was slightly off and only a few fleeting times did it gel correctly to actually convey a 3D effect. For all its artistic quality the 3D version falls short and could easily detract from the splendor of the story. Stick to the 2D version."
5,Wonderful movie,"We decided to rent this movie to see whether or not we would like it. After watching it four times, we decided we defintely needed to buy it. I love stop motion films, and this one was excellent."
3,Loses a lot on the small screen,"I loved this movie in the theater, but it loses a lot in transition to the small screen. The red-blue 3D on the DVD has nowhere near the ""wow"" factor of the polarization 3D used in the theater. And in the 2D version, the shots designed to show off the 3D effects seem very awkward.The story itself is a great, spooky, modern-day fairy tale, but on the small screen this movie just doesn't hold up."
3,Good movie but not blue ray 3D,"I suppose it's my fault for not paying closer attention to what I was buying. I assumed, wrongfully, that this was a blue ray 3D I could play on my 3D TV. It's not... it is the type of 3D that requires the multi-colored cellophane 3D glasses. If that is what you are looking for then it is fine..."
5,Love it!,My 8 year old daughter and I LOVE this movie. She loves dark humor and this fit the bill without being too dark for her age. Love the voice actors!
3,"Great Story, Creepy Movie, So-So 3D...","okay, I'll comment on ALL ascpects of the movie...This is actually a great story and story line... however, as many others have pointed out, it is creepy and actually too scary for small kids... I defn wouldn't show it to any child under the age of 10...3D aspect... well, the colors were great, but, it truly didn't take advantage of 3D technology... so, if you are getting this movie for 3D, I'd say don't!!! spend it on either Avatar, Open Season (which I'd let kids of any age watch) or Alice in Wonderland....."
5,Great movie,"Great concept and story . . . But you can't really expect less from Neil Gamon, he's just brilliant. The story has been Masterfully made into movie format. It's an especially helpful concept for alienated parents although I hate to soil the beautiful film by associating it as such, because it really is a stand alone masterpiece."
5,exceptionnel !!!,Coraline est un film exceptionnel grace notamment à la qualité du blu ray et à sa 3D.Il est indispensable et disponible avec bande son franaise et sous titres
4,Great Movie but...,So I saw it at the theater in 3D - loved it but... Be warned that the 3D dvd is red/blue and comes with the old fashion paper glasses. This was not how it was shown at the theaters. Still a great movie and luckily the 3D dvd has the movie in non-3d.
1,Forget the hype; this is a dud for all ages,"1. Supposedly this is supposed to be a ""nontraditional"" animated film... which it is. Unfortunately, it's also a very lousy film. First of all, it's not for kids; it's dark, it has a sarcastic view of the world, it's scary at times and it's definitely not funny. 2nd of all, it's not going to appeal to any human being of any age range, largely for the afore mentioned reasons and also because the whole plot is strange, although understandable.2. Again, with many films and art in general, if one wants to delude themselves that they can appreciate ""higher art"", then go ahead, but for the average Mr and Mrs America + 2 kids etc... do yourself a favor and skip this dud."
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN!!! NOT A FAMILY MOVIE!!!,"This movie while found in the Family section of the movie rental store, is not a Family movie. Completely NOT for kids -- Coraline ""kills"" her ""other parents"", and for some kids, that distinction between her real parents and fake ones can't be made -- my daughter started freaking out."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE WHAT IS LISTED,So I bought this a little over a month ago for the first time. I have seen the movie and I like the movie. But when I opened the package it did not have the cover that slips around the blue-ray case. It's not that big of a deal right. I returned it and requested a new one specifically telling both of the customer support people I talked to that it was missing the case and the new one I received did not have the cover either.
1,Coraline,I purchased Coraline as a gift for a person who requested it. I have not seen it nor do I intend to see it. I never was and never will be a Tim Buron fan.
1,boo.,I hated this movie. It was boring. Visually...it was kind of disturbing. All the characters were sort of ugly and deformed. The story line was weak. I think I fell asleep at the theatre.
2,Not for Children!,I was very disappointed in this movie. Mainly due to the fact that for over 5 minutes there is a character who is hardly clothed at all. And she's the one that the film focus on for over 5 minutes. The lady is very big chested and has a tiny bit of covering over her nipples. But the whole rest of her chest is left for everyone to see. And she's wearing a thong! I found this totally inappropriate for children.
2,Whose The Audience For This Flick?,"For starters the stop motion animation and 3-D effects are pretty darned good here. That's about it. My complaint with alot of 3-D movies is that they fashion the movies around the effects at the expense of the story. There's a story alright but the problem here is that when it's not confusing it's downright creepy. Who were they targetting for this flick? Little kids who might get the bejesus scared out of them? Disaffected adolescents who glory in unsavory imagery? Whatever! Ultimately ""Coraline"" is just a waste of time."
3,Anyone else get DVD which is way too yellow tinted?,"While the movie is wonderful, we got a DVD with tinting which is exceeding yellow. Hopefully, we merely got a random bad disc."
2,Creepy movie,"Creepy movie. And be careful showing to kids. Has two grandmas basically naked and dancing. Very disturbing. Never have liked Tim Burton movies, so maybe if you're a fan of his work you'll like this."
4,coraline blu-ray 3d at it's best,"this blu-ray 3d movie only works with 3d tvuses active or passive glasses. the color isamazing and so is the 3d depth, there are afew popouts. but most of all it's worth gettingthe last of it's copy. get it before it is soldout."
3,Quite remarkably boring for such a collection of talents,"One of the reviewers (I apologize for not remembering the name) said a phrase that describes that movie to perfection : ""frenetic and boring at the same time"" Could not agree more. It is simply amazing what happens to a - superficially - great animation with great actors behind the characters in the absence of the magic genius and black humor, like Tim Burton's. What could have been a darkly beautiful and gripping story, turns into boring predictable didactics..."
4,Dark but delicious,"This is a really wonderful movie with terrific animation, and a great story. It is much darker than I expected for a kid's movie though, and worried my children would be terrified. My 9 year old daughter is repelled and fascinated at the same time, and calls it ""creepy"". My 4 year old son LOVES it, and keeps nagging me to buy it so he can watch it over and over."
1,The worst 3D edit I've ever seen,"They took an amazing 3D theater experience and ruined it. First of all, it uses 1950's style monochrome red/green lenses. The 3d scenes are blurry and unconvincing. Furthermore, the ""3D"" disc only contains selected scenes of 3D footage! The rest of the time, you're watching standard 2D scenes through color-destroying glasses. I can't believe that the film-makers let the studio get away with such a shoddy DVD edit of what was once a beautiful work."
2,"Decent, but not great","I bought this movie looking for something different. I got different but it was not the ""different"" I was ultimately looking for. Will appeal to some, did not appeal to me."
1,"This is not Blu Ray 3D, this is a Blu Ray with anaglyph (red/blue) 3D",I have no idea who this disc is designed for. It does not support 3D on modern 3D TV (polarized or shutter glasses). It supports only anaglyph 3D (red/blue). this item should not be sold as labeled.
5,Coraline,The coraline box edition was great. It was everything that it was described to be. We have enjoyed watching the movie for hours on end.
3,OK,Good for the halloween season but a little on the scary side for some kids. I found it to be okay but not anything I could watch numerous times.
4,Great Story,"Older children, 10 and 12, love the story. Although the old ladies are rather gross and immodest, the rest is enjoyable. Good visuals, can be a little frightening to young kids."
5,Great!,This movie was exactly what I wanted for my granddaughters. They loved it! The story was wonderful and this is the kind of movie that they love.
5,Favorite!,This is one of my daughter's favorite movies. A Nightmare Before Christmas is her first choice and Coraline comes in second. She loves any movie made by Tim Burton!!
1,FUBAR,"I ordered ""Coraline (Single Disc Edition w/3D)"". I received ""Coraline (Single Edition w/2D). My Grand Daughter was very disappointed!!!! I could have paid less for this item. I chose this venue because ad stated that Amazon packed, and shipped, this item. I believed this would add a high degree of reliability to assure correct, and accurate order. Amazon has replied that they have no control over what is in vendor's wharehouses, or what is shipped. So why does Amazon advertise that they personally pack, and ship, order?? If it ain't correct, don't ship it! It is not what I orderd, do not pack it! Look at order. Look at product. If they do not match, do not prepare it for shipment. Do not advertise what you cannot do. Will this review be deleted? Amazon excersizes great control here. No?"
3,Careful what you wish for,"The animation and story behind this film is sophisticated and intriguing. Most of us, even those with really good parents, can relate to the idea that our childhoods could have been better behind the wall. All three of us viewing via Blu-ray on an excellent flat screen agreed to ditch the 3D half way through for the more beautifully rendered 2D version. The red-green glasses format was nausiating and distracting. See it in 2D as the story is good enough without the gimmick."
4,Visually stunning,"Coraline was nominated for best animated movie (Golden Globes). I haven't read the book by Neil Gaiman, but I was excited to see the film. Visually, it's absolutely majestic. The storyline is not quite as exciting as the art on screen, but it is a movie meant for children. Overall, I enjoyed it. The storyline dragged a few times for me, but honestly, I could have watched it on mute and enjoyed the movie. Without 3D glasses, I can't comment on that side of the disc, but the ""regular"" version was breathtaking."
4,Grass is not Greener,"I loved the story line of this movie. Sweet little Caroline thinks the world is so not fair until she finds the ""other side"" and realizes that home is exactly where she is suppose to be. Family is Family and eventhough life can be tough..it's worse without those that love you. Excellent movie and have recommended to others."
5,Another Christmas Gift,"I bought this for my daughter who loves Tim Burton movies, she really enjoyed it! I was happy that I got it for her."
2,Great Movie BUT this version COMES WITH GLASSES!!,"Coraline is an excellent movie that is best viewed in 3D. We looked carefully to find a version that was NOT analgyph, that did not come with special glasses. As of January 2013, this item did not show it included such glasses so we thought we had the right one. WRONG. It comes with the inexpensive glasses. So...it may work OK with standard TV, but it is not optimized for the new 3D TV/DVD/Active glass combo. Other complaint: the movie disc is two sided - one for 3d & one for 2d viewing. BUT, it is not labelled, so you have to insert it in the player to figure out which side it's playing on - big annoyance and time-waster."
4,coraline,my daughter loves it she has been wanting this movie for a long time and has me record it when it comes on tv
1,HORRIBLE for anyone younger than 13!!!,"This movie visually for a person old enough, is very pleasing. I would NOT NOT NOT let anyone younger than 13 watch it! It has a very suggestive nature. The term ""Jerk wad"" is not something that young kids need to hear. Let alone the old burlesque dancers bobbing around in nothing but pasties and ginormus breasts!! It's definatly a disturbing story...to say the least! VERY VERY creepy for kids! I think it should have been rated PG-13!!"
3,very overrated,"This movie is overrated. It is not very original. I don't know why people keep saying it is. Tell me, what exactly is original about it?It is basically another Alice in Wonderland story. James and the Giant Peach is similar but much more creative. Pan's Labyrinth was also similar (Alice in Wonderland) but was 100 times better.. Even MirrorMask was better.The gimmicky 3D visuals in Coraline were nice but if you take them away you are left with a mediocre film with a boring, cliche plot that is barely worth watching. Eye candy doesn't make up for lack of character development, lack of any theme or purpose, lack of depth, substance, soul, or humanity.Watch Pan's Labyrinth then watch Coraline and you will understand what I mean."
1,Coraline,I was really upset when we missed this at the theaters so I was thrilled when I purchased it... This movie was nothing what I expected.. Its strange and not a feel good movie in any way.... I would not recommend this movie for kids.
1,"Completely Psyco, not for little kids!","This movie is completely screwed up. Not a kids movie at all. From evil people with buttons as eyes, naked obese creepy old ladies (boobs are like watermelons and naked with tassel covering the nipples), just about any creepy and screwed up thing for a little kid that you can think of. Coraline's character is likable, but the movie ruins it. You're kid will watch it because it's psycho but I definitely do not recommend."
1,Strange & Creepy - should be PG 13 not PG,I watched this movie with my 10 year old daughter last night who was really unnerved by it - the whole ghost getting children aspect is just too much for a PG movie!Creepy & wierd - would not recommend this to anyone
5,creepy and entertaining but mild enough for my toddler to enjoy.,the story was creepy like the typical tim burton style but not too scary for my 2 yr old to love. the animation was amazing as well. great family movie!
4,Strange movie but a good adventure,"Coraline has trouble getting used to her new home, one that she shares with a Mom and Dad who don't seem to have a lot time for her. The neighbors are weird and there isn't much around. So when she finds a doorway to another world, one that's like hers but better, she begins to get lured over to the other side...The animation is done really well and the storyline is for the most part consistent. I liked this film, even though it won't make my top tier in films. Some of the visuals are VERY strange, especially the show put on by the two ladies downstairs, but you should check this out."
4,Coraline Rocks,"I loved this movie, and unusually for a film, they made a good book into a great film. I even liked the added character of Wybie, he was funny. All in all, I give this 4 stars, would have gotten 5, had the 3D version of the film worked with the ReadD glasses, like the cinema version."
3,"Good $1 Rental, Bad 3D.","The 3D effect is practically non-existing. The special effects are quite nice. And there is solid underline story. However, Amazon`s Editorial-Reviews is right when calling it "" A dark and creepy film"""
4,A little creepy,"I enjoyed this movie, the characters in the alternate reality were quite endearing. The animation, similar to ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" was done well. The story line reminded me a little of ""Pans Labyrinth"" (The old secret door in the wall thing)but I would not recommend to children under 10. My 7 and 5 year olds' were scared to the point of leaving the room and they loved ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"". Overall a neat movie, definitely a re-watch."
5,Stop-Action Animation at it's best!,Loved Coraline... good story and the Stop-Action Animation is some of the best I've seen. Seems to me we've gone to another level with the animation over even such wonderful modern classics as the Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride.
4,coraline,liked this movie but not in 3 d....you don't get the colors that really are worth seeing in this dvd
2,"campy formula flick, the stuff of late-night kids TV in the 1960s","I saw and loved this as a kid, but now my kids found this as laughable as I did. There is absolutely nothing to this except background passtime junk. There was a place for that when ""nothing else is on"", but that era is behind us now that we can immediately get what we want when we want it via the internet. OK, the action is good, the muscles are impressive, and the story is grindingly typical and unsurprising if solid. But really, it is a waste of time and electricity. Seeing it again gave me no nostalgic memories, like, say watching the Stoodges or the Bowery Boys does. I mean, there are levels of camp and this is below those second-rate classics."
3,My Review,"The product plays well, though the tape was cracked and the box was squashed. Probably caused during the transit process."
4,Bratz Babyz Fianna,"Birth Day gift for my 6 year old niece, she like bratzs, and this was a good one for her collection."
5,Eat at Mustard's Grill! (Or buy the cookbook!),"When you visit the Napa wine region you must eat at Mustard's Grill. If that is not possible then you should buy Cindy Pawlcyn and Brigid Callinan's cookbook. The recipes for fantastic grilled food, unique side dishes, and incredible desserts found in this book will make you plan your next vacation to northern California. If you like pork you will love her Mongolian pork chops with chinese mustard sauce. Serve it with her mashed potatoes and braised red cabbage for a winning meal reminiscent of the friendly restaurant nestled among Napa's vineyards. Buy this cookbook and you will immediately understand why it won a James Beard award. And I hear that another cookbook is in the works ..."
4,A fun read from across the pond.,"I love this book. Wish Mr. Brookmyer's books were readily available in the US. Take a middle age housewife with empty nest longing for adventure but whose greatest challenge is keeping the vacuum lines on the carpet neat, and whose husband is stuck comfortably in his everyday routine, throw her into the midst of a kidnapping, some fast cars, high tech toys and shady characters and things get exciting. A fast paced, page turner. I couldn't put it down."
5,Best photography book on the most powerful exhibit.,Edward Steichen's family of man was the greatest photography exhibit of all time. This is a powerful book.Try to get one that is in perfect or near perfect condition as it is an old book and some are very worn.
5,A classic for all mankind,"The Family of Man was all the rage when I was in college when the 60's were full of the promise of love for one another. As our world has continued on the bumpy and circuitous path toward enlightenment, taking steps forward and back, this book continues to remind us that throughout the world, we are more alike than different and our shared humanity is reason to put down arms and get along. I have chosen this book as a gift for my favorite graduates every spring, connecting my generation to future ones."
3,Works,"Bare essential, but works fine. I have yet to install it, but it fits well for my use. I like it."
3,"Good product, hardware is iffy","Bought these for my boat. They were a great accessory, the only thing you must do is upgrade the screws that come with this. They either stripped or broke going into plywood."
3,rod holder,"These are larger than I hoped, might not install on the boat. Tubes cold lunch spuds with a little work. THey will work for large and small rods, just might not be a clean looking install."
4,Solid,"Solid construction. I attached this to a milk crate that then sits in the tank well of my kayak. The width of the item is the exact same width as the milk crate so it's a perfect fit. There are no stops inside the tubes so your rod will slide down until the reel sits against the top of the tube. Maybe a feature, maybe a problem depending on usage. I'm taking it as a feature. Some tubes have a slot cut in the top so the reel actually slides down a bit into the tube. These tubes do not have that feature.BTW, it is supposed to come with the mounting screws but mine did not, so be warned. For me it didn't matter as I used zip ties for attachment."
3,Not my favorite...,"I'll preface this by saying that I've only listened to the cd once, and sometimes it takes several listens to really ""get"" the cd. I don't know if I'll actually get to that point, however. Yeah, the lyrics were good; yeah, the band's matured. But overall, I found it BORING... Although the distinctive, not-quite-right Sonic Youth sound is still very much apparent, I miss the snotty, in-your-face attitude of past releases. I think I'll continue to crank the old stuff when I need a Sonic Youth fix."
1,Where are my earplugs when I need them?,"Never ceases to amaze me what people call talent these days. These guys were just on Conan O'Brien. The chick is absolutely the most tone-deaf ""singer"" I have ever heard. The tunes are just a bunch of meaningless chord progressions and melodies. Save your money!"
1,Just as bad in concert too!,"Just saw Sonic Youth in San Francisco opening for Pearl Jam. Sonic Youth was perhaps the worst opening band I have ever seen. The female singer must be tone deaf to sing as bad as she did. My opinion of this band was confirmed when I listened to the studio album Rather Ripped. It is just as bad an their live show. I would not let even my dog listen to this album, for fear he would hate me. What was Eddie thinking? By the way, PJ was awesome!- a concerned citizen"
5,"One of their best since ""NYC Ghosts and Flowers""","The title says it all. Honestly, though, I would have given this four stars before I saw them perform the album in Providence, mid-February, and if any hardcore SY fans were kind of disappointed by it, go see them play it. Their onstage versions aren't much different, but they mixed it in with a lot of stuff from ""Sister"" and ""Daydream Nation,"" which put this album in the proper context. It really is closer to those albums than anything else they've done recently."
5,Avant-Garde,"SY has been always a great noise experience. Most people doesn't get them, and that's fine. SY is not for everyone. ""Do you believe in rapture?"" it's their most mature song so far. If you don't believe in rapture, this isn't for you."
1,Buy Calico Girl instead!!!!,"Though the music is great, PLEASE do not buy this album, especially as a digital download. Sony Records, now the owner of Texas Music Group, refuses to pay Guy royalties for digital downloads of this album. He owns the rights to all of the songs, so he has re-recorded this album, and released it independently under the title Calico Girl. Support the artist so he can continue to produce more wonderful music, and DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!! Buy Calico Girl instead!"
2,Very disappointing...,"I've purchased many books from Amazon, and loved most of them. I've also purchased many Taschen Interiors series books and have always been impressed. This book is such a let down. There is no new material in this book, just reprints or different angles of shots that were already used in 'Seaside Interiors"". The only text is in the beginning and reads like someones summer diary....overdramatic at that. This book is sized like a handbook, but with no material of any use to someone looking for 'Seaside Style' design ideas. I've made arrangements to return it."
2,don't judge this book by it's title,"having gotten into interior design books and magazines i was thrilled to find a treasure trove of interior design-themed books at amazon and preceded to order one right after another;usually with a visual preview of the chosen item.I added this particular book, seaside style ,to my wish list based on the cover ,assuming it featured interior ideas for beach side residences.I finally ordered the book,inspired by it's cover and wasn't expecting it to be a page after page pictorial of seaside locations;great photographs,color photographs,but little or no text describing each scene.You leaf through to the end of each series of photographs to a brief directory which will tell you where the photos are taken,but nothing else.This isn't an interior design book which for me makes the title of the book a bit misleading."
5,Dreamy,I love this little book. I picked up a copy of it from Old Navy and have enjoyed it ever since. The images are just amazing.
4,"pretty good, better things to come",Gish has some good songs like I am One and Siva but the album isn't exactly brilliant. Later albums like Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness show what the band is really all about.
5,The only smashing pumpkins cd worth owning,"Gish was definitely a watershed cd for the 90's. After Gish, the pumpkins simply became boring."
4,"Ha ha ha...""Gish"" rhymes with ""Fish""!!!!! Ha ha ha!!!","i only really like this album because i like fish, and in case you've been living under a rock, ""Gish"" does, in fact, rhyme with ""Fish"". How exciting!!! Actually, it took a little while to get the hang of this album....to understand what the band was trying to accomplish, what they were all about and what they were trying to say, the message they were to trying to send to their fans...unlike ""Siamese Dream"" and ""Mellon Collie"", where you get instant gratification, this album is like trying to embrace a slimy, slithering.......FISH!!!!! But if you don't get the hang of it, hang in there, baby, it'll come to you. The Pumpkins' debut almost sounds like Sonic Youth, escpecially #4...can't remeber the name...well, i'm very forgetful...i only remeber names that rhyme with....FISH!!!!!"
3,Astonishing,"The most profound and innovative use of a single chord progression played time and time again until the listener is fooled into believing that there are, in actual fact, different songs. Sweet soothing harmonies teamed with a band image not to be seen on the morning of a hangover. Wonderful."
5,My Pumpkins Favorite,"There is just something special about this album in comparison to other work from Pumpkins. This web site considers ""Gish"" just as essential as ""Simease Dream"" and ""Mellon Collie..."" I think it may be even more essential. This is by far the best debut album I have ever heard. The lyrics and music always come across as significant. Some people say this is grungy, yet it still sounds like a timeless classic to me."
5,"AS A PUMPKINS FAN,THIS IS WHAT YOUVE DREAMED OF!!!!","i really have dreamed about this type of package from my favorite bands for as long as i can remember and im happy to say that this gish box set does not disappoint!! its got everything i hoped for and lots i didnt expect!! all lyric,song by song commentary,'post card' photos. disc one is the remastered version of gish and it sounds incredible. disk two is tons of outtakes and unreleased and alt versions of gish era song,which are awesome!! the third disc is a dvd and a real gem as its a full on early concert by the band. this overall set is a real treat to any pumpkins fan and a must have.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
3,Winsome aggresion,"3 1/2Besides the original tinny production and some slight repetition with the songwriting, first generation alternative debuts rarely sounded as assured as Gish did. This has dated a bit over the years, but the influence and underlying chemistry which made the band stand out amongst many peers remains evident."
4,Beware aware of what you are buying...,"This is a great album by a great band and it's sad they didn't make more music like this, but be aware. The description says Audio CD...it is actually a Vinyl Album record. I kept it anyway, because I love the record but the description still hasn't been corrected to show what you will actually be receiving."
5,Pumpkin's Smashing debut!,"This is the root of the Pumpkin's music. Recorded way back in 1990-91, the descriptive lyrics weave a tale of the band member's early lives. The powerful ""Window Paine"" and ""Snail"" compliment the interrogative ""Daydream."""
5,Really Good Album,"I must say that this is, by far, my favorite album by the Pumpkins in addition to being one of my favorite albums ever. This is, in my opinion, the defining heart and soul of the pumpkins. Any of their new songs which have been successful have some shared trait with the work on this album. The powerful yet artistic drumwork by Jimmy Chamberland is. . . beautiful. Billy's voice and guitar is awsome. This entire album is just good music, with my favorite, Rinocerous, serving as a pinnicle. The album is just raw Smashing Pumpkins, and it is an amazing piece of work. I love it a lot."
3,Un Buen Inicio,"Este disco marco el inicio de los smashing pumpkins, sin duda un gran disco, con esa energia que movia al mundo en los inicios de los 90s, un gran disco de lo que alguna ves fue llamado Grunge"
3,not vinyl,"Although I thoroughly enjoy this album and have been listening to it constantly, I was very disappointed when it came in as cd instead of the vinyl record which it said it was."
4,It's like following a journey,"If you like how the Pumpkins sound now or during some of their other releases, it is vital that you see where they came from. It's less polished than their other albums but it still reminds me a tad of Siamese Dream. The songs in Siamese Dream seem a little more calculated and the songs in Gish seems more free flowing and wild. Jimmy Chamberlin is given free reign on the drums and uses it to its full potential. I have to say that Snail is my favorite. There are other great songs but I think the main thing to get out of this album is to enjoy Smashing Pumpkins raw and free beginnings.One of these days I'm going to listen to all of their albums in a row because I think that they all kind of transition into the next one."
3,Good,"As a huge Pumpkins fan, I would say that Gish is a strong album with some good songs. I'd even say that, for most bands, an album like that would be their best album. But this is certainly not the best Smashing Pumpkins album.Their debut is one that shows a huge amount of technical ability. By technical ability, I mean that the members of the band can play their instruments better than you would often hear. I always refered to this as the Smashing Pumpkins' Led Zeppelin album because it has the same idea as much of Zeppelin's music: show off on guitar as much as possible. However, it did not display the same emotions as are shown in the Smashing Pumpkins' later albums.It's a good album with some solid songs such as Window Pain, Rhinoceros and Snail. However, it is not their best album by far."
4,this is no 5 star but it is still great,The first album by the pumpkins has every thing from dreamy lyrics to bass heavy riffs and one of the greatest alt rock song and from the start with i am one thay start you on a ride that ends with the very odd lyrics and low voice tones of D'arcy on daydream and it is over all a great album for the first attempt of that any fan (and the pumpkins them self) should be proud of
3,there are too many quiet and very slow tracks,"I got the album because of ""I am one"". It's one of my favourite alltime tracks."
5,The unique combination of raw and beautiful...,"I remember catching the video for ""Siva"" latenight on MTV back in late '91 or early '92, and just sitting there, stunned, by what I was hearing. ""Gish"" has turned out to be my all time favorite album, and even though I haved loved most of the Pumpkins' stuff since, they were unable to surpass the shocking originality of this CD. It makes you race, then slow, then race again, and you just loose yourself in a myriad of guitars with a raw edge, or putting out 60's-like psychedelic riffs, or taking you of into dreamland. ""I Am One"" grabs you, and the rest of the tracks never let you go. I'm online now buying yet another copy because I keep wearing them out (or stepping on them, or someone sets the b on it and scratches it -- you know how it goes)."
4,when you read this book think of Owen Wilson,"It's so simple and that is scary.With this story we get to see inside the mind of a simple man.A simple man that simply kills.His habit of killing is the equivalent to a nicotine addiction.He simply needs his fix and he doesn't have to go to great lengths to get it.A drop of some poison as easy as buying a pack of cigarettes. I loved this book but I have to admit that I had the ADVANTAGE of seeing the movie first.Owen Wilson is so damn lovable and cute and that made the story so damn terrifying.It is a completely believable work of fiction.I'm not sure what you should do first---rent the movie or read the book. Whichever order, make sure you do both."
5,Don't drink from a stranger's flask,"The Minus Man is a harrowing journey into the mind of a mild mannered man who happens to be a psychopath. His method of killing is a quiet one, poison laced Southern Comfort. Lew McCreary's novel is spellbinding, using a finely tuned skill to make the reader care for, if not love a murderer. And a mass murderer at that. Van Siegert is one of the most fascinating characters I've come across in recent memory. His calm descriptions of killing are intended to convey a sense of normalcy in murder. The fact that he kills for no reason is scary enough, the idea that he can easily validate his murders is terrifying. If you are a fan of novels about psycho killers but want something that's not a slasherflick on the page, check out this book!The Minus Man was made into an excellent film starring Owen Wilson (in a sorely overlooked performance) as the quiet, yet lethal Van Siegert. Read the book, watch the movie, and don't drink from a stranger's flask."
4,"Barely a 4 star read, but it made it.","I really had to think about giving this book a 4 star rating.While I found the book to be mostly enjoyable, it was obvious that Mr. McCreary is not an accomplished writer. I also did not like how one of the supporting characters in the book murders his wife. I found this to be a little to unbelievable.However, I must admit that the narrative of the serial killer is quite interesting. It was interesting to hear the mind of someone who barely feels. Someone who just moves throughout life with hardly any planning of the future being made.I will give this book 4 stars out of 5. Just barely though."
4,well made,"I really like this knife. the only thing I don't like is that the safety switch will turn on in your pocket and in a emergency situation this could be the end of you. I personally have never had it open accidently. the pocket clip is very secure. sometimes, depending on what pants Im wearing it is hard to get from my pocket quickly. I prefer this to the alternative, that it is not there when you need it. well made"
5,Great knife,"After researching a lot on Amazon I ended buying this knife and I'm really happy with it. The knife opening system with the spring is great and with a little training it work just like an automatic knife (pushing the button). The only comment is that the security lock could be better placed: you cant unlock and open the knife without changing the grip; you need to move the knife in your hand after unlocking it so you can open it.I'm going to push this a little further with some more heavy work with the knife (and may edit this review later), but so far, I really like the knife, that stays in my pocket ALL the time."
2,Deservedly forgotten,"These reviews make me laugh.Yes, Adrian tried somehting different. Yes, his voice is good. But the end result is atrocious. Yes, it's Foreigner. But bad Foreigner. The work has not an ounce of own personality.The solos are fine. But the songs... Oh my..."
2,"Pass the cheese, please...","I so wanted to like this CD. Unfortunately the lyrics of the songs remind me of semifinalists in a high school poetry writting contest. I just can't get past the ""story"" of the songs in order to appreciate the music and vocals. A bit too sweet for my taste."
3,Best natural deodorant I've tried,"For a natural deodorant this is the best I've used but I am not giving it five stars because I am holding out for a natural deodorant that works as well as non-natural.... that I will give five stars.Personally, I have to apply this twice a day. However, aside from repeatedly applying the product I have no complaints. The scent is nice and light and the feeling is good when you put it on, even right after shaving.I firmly believe that one of these days soon there will be a much better selection of natural deodorants, toothpastes, etc.... so I'll keep trying new stuff... in the mean while, this will do fine."
2,Bad reaction,"I wanted to like this deodorant but it did not work well for me. The smell was great but I felt like I had to reapply it every few hours -- I was actually carrying it around in my bag with me. Also, whether it was the over-application or just a bad reaction, it made my the skin around my underarms peel. I've never had that with a deodorant ever, so that was a huge turn-off.I've since switched to the Thai crystal and it seems to be working well. No peeling or burning. BUT, everyone is different, so give EarthScience a try if you want something natural."
5,This natural deodorant WORKS!,"I really don't want to have to use regular deodorants that include aluminium due to the potential health problems that aluminium is linked to, so I've spent years searching for something natural that works. I've tried several natural brands including Tom's and one called JASON, but they never worked for more than a few hours. I am so happy I tried this product because it REALLY WORKS! Even after 15 hours, no body odor is evident and the armpits of my shirts are not infused with BO either. I'm astonished and have likely found a product that I'll be sticking with for as long as it's available. If you're tired of natural deodorants that don't work, then give this one a shot. IT WORKS!"
5,Great product for armpits!,"I was tired of using those name brand deodorants and did not work well to cover the odor. It would be worse! I decided to give this deodorant a try and it works well for me. I live in a tropical climate...the smell does not last all day if I sweat a lot but compared to the other name brand deodorants, it's a whole lot better!"
1,Horrible Product,"AWFUL SELLER!!!!!! I buy quite a bit from Amazon and I have never wrote a negative review. Worst seller I have ever dealt with. The product is awful and does not work at all. I have no idea why it is even called deodorant. They will not refund you unless it is an ""unopened-unused product""...and you have to send it back ""at your cost as well."" HORRIBLE customer service. Do not buy from this seller....I know I never will again."
3,**Ok Cd From The Juice Man**,"this cd is alright, it is nothing classic, but it a solid relase from the north north representer juicy j. He has a couple of guest apperance in it, includeing project pat, and three six mafia. If your a big three six mafia fan go out and get this dope rapper.NORTH NORTH!-Holla"
4,Best Juicy J Album,"If you only buy one solo album from anyone with Three 6 Mafia, this is the one to buy. If your a pro you will get the Michael 5000 Watts chopped/screwed version with this as well. Def. a must have for any Three 6 Mafia fans. Roll up and roll out."
5,BUY THIS NOW,"This album is tight! Tight beats, hard lyrics, alot of bass. This is a good album in your car anytime My two favorite songs gotta be North North, and Killa Klan. This album gets play in my car along with Project Pat - Layin Tha Smackdown which I highly recommend as well."
5,BUY THIS NOW,"This album is tight as hell. Tight beats, hard lyrics, alot of bass. This is a good album in your car anytime My two favorite songs gotta be North North, and Killa Klan. This album gets play in my car along with Project Pat - Layin Tha Smackdown which I highly recommend as well."
3,"COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,GUESS WHAT YOU STILL THUGGIN IT!!!","HAVE THIS FOR A CLASSIC,IF YOUR A THRRE SIX FAN!!"
3,Not the Best,"I am a true die hard fan of 3-6 and this cd did not impress me much. I bought it without hearing it first because of who it is (Juicy J--one of the best producers out there), but I should have waited ... I felt that it lacked the crunkness that I am use to 3-6 bringing. Don't get me wrong, I still bump it in the ride but it could have been a lot better."
1,JUICY THE FRUITY BALLS J,"JUST ANOTHER WAY TO STILL ARE MONEY,BY A RE-RELEASED BOOTY RAPPER SLOB ON MY...NORTH!NORTH!"
5,Great performance - Handelian?,"Mr. VanderSande hits on a point or two that distinguish this from other period-instrument performances of the orchestral suite cycle.Reading his review, I am prompted to put into concise words that of which this recording reminds me, now --And that is that the Boston Baroque give a somewhat Handelian sound to Bach. While I'm not sure that would be ideal everywhere, it works quite well with the orchestral suites.If you're starting to expand a basic Bach collection, buy this."
4,A surprisingly good read...,"My Old True Love was chosen by my book group. The blurb on it left me unsure of investing my time in it, but oh my, I'm glad I did. Sheila Kay Adams is a master at characterization. Her protagonists were solid, real folks indicative of the time, Civil War, and place - the mountains of North Carolina. The conflicts of war, unrequited love, and betrayal are no different today than a hundred and fifty years ago. These families are imperfect, but that's part of what makes the reader care about and relate to them. Folk music lyrics are interspersed within the story, and become caught up in the tale itself. By the way, a CD is available if you want to actually listen to the music, some performed by Adams herself.I felt that the ending was a bit rushed. I needed a little more time to ease out of the story, but that is a small comcomplaint and shouldn't hold anyone back from devouring this small gem."
5,An Awesome Story- My New Favorite Book,"Not since Lee Smith's Fair and Tender Ladies, has there been a book as touching as this one. Other reviews have said what the story is about, so I won't repeat all that, but will say this is a fantastic book.From the first page, I was hooked. It was the first page-turner I've read in quite awhile. I couldn't put it down. Every page was exciting to read, without a lot of fillers and descriptive junk. I love it. Love it. Love it."
2,Poetic license FTL,"I did not enjoy this book. The translations were far too liberal for my tastes. Good concept, bad execution. Meh."
5,I don't know why more people haven't read this book!,"This book, quite frankly, rocked my world. I have been teaching Hinduism for a number of years to undergraduates. This is one of those rare books that will completely change your perspective on material that you thought you knew. It is exceptionally well thought out and researched. You can tell that she gets excited about her research. That excitement is contagious. I just don't know why more scholars aren't talking about this book."
3,The Callander Square Mysterious Disappointment,"I have not read all of the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series but enough to know that Callandar Square is both typical and essential to an Anne Perry fan. The intimate detail of a Victorian novel as well as a stunning depiction of the innuendos and intricacies of period manners styles and interactions is palpably present. I was a little disappointed with the rapidity and almost deus-ex-machina ending but must admit that I wept at Pitt's appreciation of the unique lovableness of Charlott in the end. Otherwise the character development and interaction was well-crafted and held my interest. A good read for fans, but not a starting place."
3,Not as exciting as the first one.,"Having discovered a new detective series (new to me) with ""The Cater Street Hangman,"" I was really looking forward to reading all the books in sequence. This one, however, didn't hold up to the pace or energy of the first one. I found it slow going, actually. And between the end of the last one and the beginning of this one Charlotte and Thomas were married -- cheating us all out of quite a bit of information, such as how her father took it, how everything went, etc. But it was an interesting plot and, I must say, I didn't guess the answer before the end, so all in all it was clever. I'm not really disappointed, but I hope the rest of the series regains the excitement of the first book."
2,Disappointed. There's no relationship.,"If you like historical details, and want to know about Victorian London, manners and mores, this is the book for you. If you like full drawn characters that you can relate to, I'd skip these. I love serials, and bought the first four. I wish I'd only bought the first two. This is the second book and there is nothing about the courtship or wedding, or the relationship, or parents and sibling reactions. Anne Perry keeps telling me that Charlotte is independent, but I really only have her word for that, as marrying Thomas ""beneath her station"" seems to be the only independent thought she has. I'm disappointed in the characters, or lack of same; all of these people are strangers to each other, but even worse they are strangers to me. I disagree with other reviews that say the writing is good. It is adequate."
4,What a fun read!,"I enjoyed The Cater Street Hangman, and decided to read number 2 in Perry's series featuring Charlotte and Thomas Pitt. I found this second book to be a lot of fun. The description of life ""upstairs and downstairs,"" so to speak, was most interesting, and of course the mystery was intriguing. I felt that Perry worked out the mystery, leaving a few clues for the reader, in a logical fashion and at the end I felt satisfied.I hope that her future books in the series, which I plan to try to read in order, will be at least as good as this one, and maybe even better in terms of character development."
3,Golf course architecture,"Nice pictures, fair text. Missed reviews of great classic holes - classic architecture with more information albeit non-specific about newer courses. Too general. Was looking for more technical information. Ken Wehr"
1,Absolute Garbage,"Poorly-written, re-warmed Cosmo articles parading as ""medicine."" Sensationalistic tone and ridiculous, unfounded assertions don't help matters, especially when the logic used is as tortured as the argument leading up to the conclusion that we'll all live to be 200 (well, we've doubled our lifespans in the last 100 years, haven't we? So, in the next 100, we're bound to double it again! Never mind all that crazy stuff like immunizations, sanitation, antibiotics, etc...)An insult to the lay reader and the physician alike"
3,"Not the finest episodes, but not horrendous","Contrary to the opening credits, Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki did NOT direct the episodes on this tape. However, he did direct episodes on ""Sherlock Hound in Tales of Mystery"" and ""Sherlock Hound in Dogs of Bowserville."" (Probably the translators got lazy and just used the same credits for all the tapes in the series.) Compared to Miyazaki's actual episodes, these are clearly weaker. However, judging them on their own merits, there is still an element of fun. Each episode has a clever robbery scheme by the villian, Moriarity, and his bumbling henchmen, Smiley and George, which is always foiled by Holmes. Grade school children would enjoy this tape. --The Miyazaki episodes, by contrast, are enjoyable to all ages, even with repeat viewing. For more information, see nausicaa.net, a website dedicated to the works of Hayao Miyazaki."
2,"It's not the bee's knees, unfortunately...","For awhile I've been a fan of Ugorski's milking everything possible from the written notes, but this disc just rubs me the wrong way. A lot of architecture and structure are lost, the music constantly falls apart, one is constantly made aware of where Maestro Anatol's fingers are and what they're doing, but I regrettably miss out on too much of the music. Too much whimsy, it's just entirely too wayward, I'm sorry, but I was expecting these performances to be monumental and breathtaking... There's an incredible sense of magic, I'll give it that, but it feels almost like piano for beginners, like a sort of cop out from an aged pianist who no longer has the goods but indulges himself and his loyal following -- but, the thing is, this guy definitely still has chops, but he just gets way too carried away with trying to reinvent the wheel that he just can't see the forest for the trees. Or some such hackneyed nonsense."
2,"If You're a Fan of 'Black Coffee Blues'-Style H.R., Look Elsewhere","Having read through ""Black Coffee Blues"" and ""Smile You're Traveling"" and loved them, I anxiously bought this book in '03 and really looked forward to it. Man, was I disappointed! I've tried, several times since then, to pick it up again and have had no luck in doing so.For newer Rollins fans, know that there are two Henry's: 1.) funny, articulate, insightful Henry of ""Smile You're Traveling"" and his spoken word albums; 2.) the angry-at-everything, combative punk rocker who screams cliched lyrics over generic hard rock music. This book showcases Henry #2. Fans of Henry #1 should look elsewhere. Believe me, the two are as different as night and day.I've never been able to get into Rollins' music, either with Black Flag or the Rollins Band. But I respect the fact that many people love this stuff, and those are the people who will enjoy this book of lyrics.Me? I'll just go read ""Broken Summers"" again."
3,Real neat...,"I think this is a very fun game, but I wish I were able to catch more. The larger fish constantly snap lines. So far I have been unable to catch a large (anything over 14 pounds) fish."
4,I am pleased,One of my loves is playing the piano. And this book is a good book to learn the songs you love on the instrument you love. So I would recommend it. Plus it comes with an array of different types of songs so yo uget a little of everything. Enjoy. I know I will be.
1,disturbing,"Peterson has edited at least part of God's word here. Most noticeable is Psalm 150, where ""praise him with dancing"" has been left out. Apparently, Peterson is one of those who feel that dancing is bad, so it shouldn't be in the Bible. This makes me wonder what else he has edited, changed or left out to conform to his own beliefs?"
3,The Sybase Sql Server Survival Guide,Pretty neat book ...with lot of helpful tips. Definitely for an advanced user only!! Good desktop reference to own. Don't get daunted by the small print of the book ( in comparison to some other Sybase books!! ) Takes reader through all the concepts of Database Administration and also servers as a ready reckoner.
5,This movie really touched my heart!!!,"When I saw the movie, the first time...I cried all night. Now, I had seen the movie 4 times!! An important person in my life recommended me the movie...and now is our movie.Really, really touched my heart....I feel so identified with Nick and Brandon's love.Two thumbs up!!!"
4,"Tito, get me some tissues.","Don't watch this movie alone, you'll need extreme comforting after you've seen it. Don't watch this movie if you're angry at AIDS, you'll only become more bitter. Don't watch this movie if you've recently broken up with your partner, it'll only give you ideas on what to ask for alimony, but then again, watch it and give me half of what you claim! :-) If you have AIDS, watch this movie and give yourself a hug from me, because you don't deserve this dreadful decease. Take care and know, that I am keeping you and those suffering from aids always in my thoughts and prayers. This one's for you Vince. I miss you."
4,Powerful and sad,This is an excellant film. The acting is exceptional and the script is powerful. This drama draws you in and keeps you. I recommend it.
1,Sentimental Dreck,"Wildly offensive film which uses the AIDS crisis as an opportunity for self-righteous shallow soap-opera. Eric Roberts' lover leaves him when Roberts is diagnosed with HIV. This potentially powerful situation could have led to an honest portrayal of the pressures, both external and internal, present on gay relationships. But no, Randal Kleiser (the director of Grease and the Blue Lagoon) has no interest in anything that ""deep."" He wants lots of opportunities for tearful farewells, tearful recriminations, and tearful tearfulness. The film succeeds best as a depiction of a community meeting a devastating plague with passive aggressiveness, bitchiness, anger, rage, hatred, unforgivingness, and a notable lack of grace. As a gay man who has lost several friends to AIDS, and who knows several couples who have worked very hard to salvage relationships despite one partner being HIV+, I found this film unspeakably offensive."
5,Friends,"If you have ever known anyone with AIDS or HIV, you HAVE to watch this movie. The cast acts so well and the movie is done very tastefully. It tugs on your heartstrings and will leave you feeling free, liberated, sad and a little angry at what this disease does to people. Plus, just the bonds of friendship are enough to make this movie a classic movie among Steel Magnolia type movie fans! I just keep hoping they release it on DVD!"
3,A labor of love,"I've read that it took years for this film to get made and every studio in town turned it down. After finally watching it, I understand why. It doesn't have that happy-go-lucky-feel-good quota that Hollywood must churn out to make the masses happy. This film is about AIDS and how one man decides to end his life. The idea of a dying man having all his friends over for a last party before he swallows a handfull of pills is not exactly gonna do Harry Potter box office now is it? The person to watch here is Eric Roberts, the creepy brother of Julia, who turns in THE performance of his career. He saves this movie from some crap dialog and preposterous situations. Margaret Cho, Marlee Matlin and the criminally underrated Lee Grant (as Eric Roberts devastated, chain smoking mother) all give solid support. This is not for everyone, but it is rewarding and brave."
5,Memories of this film,"Yes, it was in theaters at the end of the 90's. I had forgotten most of the story. It amazes me that the cast was made up of gay actors, gay in real life. The end still brought tears to my eyes. Eric Roberts is dying from AIDS. He decides to throw himself a good-bye party. It isn't sad all the way through. Roberts tosses in a bit of funny lines. It is available on Amazon."
1,"Avoid this movie like the, well...you know.","I want the two hours I wasted watching this piece of tripe back! 45 minutes into this maudlin, didactic, hyper-melodramatic film I was screaming ""Die already!"" at the screen. A must-see for film students, if only to show them how NOT to put a film together. Save your money and donate it to a worthy AIDS-relief charity. Don't spend it on this garbage."
2,Not the Original Recordings,I bought this CD to use during my wedding and reception. No where in the product description is it mentioned these are not the original recordings of the songs. I was very displeased with this and ended up not even using the CD.
2,wrong disney love songs cd,unfortunately this is not the cd I was looking for. I wanted the loves songs cd sung by the original artists from the movies and this one is as my kids put it imposters.
5,Must see inventive comedy ...,"A coworker of mine had season 1 and lent it to a bunch of us. After getting through the initial shock of how bizaar it is, we were all struck by how ingenious the show is. Watch everything, the background, shop windows, extras ... it is layers and layers of cleverness. The three main actors are soooo talented, inventing multitudes of realistically absurd characters. It is so much fun once you realize that nothing is sacred.""What's all this shouting ? We'll have no trouble here!"""
2,Wrong music altogether,"Actually I think the problem is that the record company made a horrible pressing mistake. Like the other reviewer my copy has 10 tracks too, but my computer tells me that the songs are the 10 that comprise Vitesse's album ""What Can Not Be, But Is.""Music definitely sounds more like Vitesse (incl. a female vocalist) than like the Clientele. Bummer -- I like Vitesse OK, but I wanted a Clientele album....Two stars for the screwup, and to warn potential buyers!"
5,A must for students of hula,"This book obviously has humble orgins. Much of it is in a typeface resembling typewritten pages, and it is a compilation of papers written by various authors. However its historical perspective on the initial explorers description of hula, the rites of the halau hula (hula school) and in particular the historical activities of hula on the island of Kaua`i is invaluable to the student of Hawaiian culture and hula. I read it and immediately started buying the other books referenced in it."
2,brain age,I did not like it because it is for nintendo. But that is no ones fault but mine. I did not pay attention when I ordered it.
5,Brain Age,Great game to keep your mind sharp. It is easy to use and is excercise to keep your brain fit. Highly recommended
1,Mis-leading Item Description!!,"After receiving the two ""Brain Age"" packages from Amazon, I went back and checked the description on the web site. Sure enough, there is absolutly no mention of a hardware device you must purchase (i.e. Nintendo DS). It is written as if everything is included that you need. Very, very, misleading.I will return these items, and look for other gifts for Christmas."
1,Not what I expected,Of course I am brain dead. Why else would I order this game? I didn't see anywhere in the explanation where you had to BUY a whole bunch of other stuff. What a disappointment. I sent it back. So far I haven't had my credit card credited back. So I would like to review this with less than a star--how about a dwarf star? Or a black hole?
1,Misinformation! This is *** NOT *** a stand-alone game!!!,"I saw it mentioned on ABC's 20/20 last night, and the first thing I did, was search for it at Amazon. Fortunately, I chanced upon Carla Schroeder's comment. Had it not been for her warning, I would have ordered one for my brother as well. So, thank you, Carla, for saving me $39.90!"
1,Brain Age,"VERY disappointed, as this was simply a disc. I don't own a Nintendo game. The way it showed on TV I thought it was a game I was purchasing. I can't use this at all."
2,Shoddy,"Essentially a good idea, but utterly hamstrung by poor speech recognition and VERY poor character recognition.Make no mistake, these two things serve to completely ruin the game."
4,Fun Game i luv to play,"This game is awesome. I love to play it, and i play it everyday. In school it gets me way far ahead, and much quicker too at math. The only thing that puts the game at a rate of overall 4 stars is that in one of the games you have to speak out, and sometimes it won't take your answer. this happens sometimes, but it kind of stinks because your getting tested, so when it won't take it it counts it as wrong. But i gotta say don't let this little thing stop you from buying this game. It will kill alot of time. On long trips i always take it, and whenever i get to my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing the ds? It totally rocks! i used to get car sick because i was bored, and just sitting in the car, but now i don't get car sick at all, because im doing something else. This game has made me good, and quick at math in my school. It really helped. This game is definitely good for all ages even my dad plays it!"
5,Make your brain work really well!!,"This game is awesome! After working with it, you can really see improvement in your skills AND Dr. Kawashima gives you a chuckle or four as well! I highly recommend this game to anyone from 8 years old to 90!!"
4,Lots of fun with 1 little quirk,"I really do like this game. Supposedly, it is supposed to improve your brain power....time will tell about that. But it is fun to try the tests - it picks three random each session and if you keep coming back everyday it will add new ones. I try to play it everyday and my scores have improved as seen through the charts.I also like the soduko puzzles - although I really didn't think I would. But I tried them to try to ward off Alzheimers and found they were challenging.It just has 1 quirk that I have noticed so far. There is an exercise where you name the colors of words and sometimes it can't understand what you are saying or gives you a false wrong. This is very frustrating to me so at the place that asks if I can speak, I just always say no and it gives me a different test. Other than that, I really enjoy the game."
4,Nintendo Junkie,"Since I acquired the Nintendo, I have enjoyed many games. Brain Age is the one that makes me feel like I am doing something of value. It guilts me into returning each day to see if I improve my scores. I can't vouch for it improving IQ but it does seem to teach us to improve on the tasks presented so if life ever presents a stroop test... I'm an ace."
3,Brain Age,I enjoy the math but so far it can't read my handwriting so I fail in all of the handwriting portions which makes my brain age lower than it should be. I bought this to keep my brain active and I think the math helps that. I am working on the handwriting.
3,Not overly boring,"I got this game for a road trip we took. There really isn't anything exciting about this game but my husband and I have fun trying to beat each others age and see who can draw the best. So far Im winning with an age of 22, not bad for a 23 yr old I guess."
2,At least is has Soduku,"I found it rather frustrating how often it misunderstood my speech (English IS my first language) and even more-so my numbers it frequently misread my 1's, as 4's and made up numbers for my 8's, all of which I could probably ""train"" myself for. What I couldn't stand and ultimately lead to my abandoning this game was the repetitiveness and the number of screens you need to just to get to the training. The attempted humor FAILS and I don't need to see the same ""how to make this software more useful"" screens over and over and over for a program intended for daily training, guess what, its working I remember them from yesterday and every day prior, shut up and let me get to the training already.Soduku was fun, unfortunately it didn't have many games and your score was horribly punished by the games inability to interpret your numbers.Something intended for daily training should not be so annoying just to get to the training."
4,Brain Age for Nintendo DS,I love this game. Its many games in one all short and simple. We all know that keeping your body in shape is a good thing. Its about time that exercising your brain takes a place on center stage. Keeping or improving your mental faculties might actually become more impressive than a six pack one day!
2,Brain Age failure,"Overall it is a good game. However, when I speak into the unit to identify a color it sometimes marks the answer wrong when it was obviousely correct. Also, when writing answers on the screen occasionally it interpets the answer wrong. These incorrect interpetations counts against the final score which is suppose to indicate improvement in overall brain function."
5,Brainage,Can't put it down. Well worth the price. You will love all the different levels of problem solving this game throws at you. Be ready.
2,Difficult to use,"The portion you speak, rather awkward in public, plus, ""say red"", this is rated incorrectly. Also, when trying to write mathematical answer, it takes the first stroke, flashes wrong back at you, and you haven't completed drawing the number. It should be rated according to grade level, not imply it is for adults."
2,EASILY BORED WITH,"got some what bored with this game after playing it a few days.Guess it's nice to see if you can improve your speed etc. But it's to much over and over . once in a while it will put on another test , or quiz etc .To me it's ok for a little while of doing it then it gets to be BLAH.Once you do all the tests then you're done.""and theres not that many""! it won't record your progress til the next day , you'd just have to keep a log of your scores to see if you improve. ""Well, to each his own ,I was'nt impressed with it .I wouldnt recommend it as something to play alot of ; maybe if you just want to see how you do from time to time not constantly..""Again the reviews swade me"" Thoughtit would have a lot of stuff to do to keep me interested."
1,Not worth your money,"Every dang time you play the game you must go through the instructions. I only need to read instruction once and I hate having to page through the instructions over and over again. I just want to play. I got it for my son, he won't play it and I do not blame him. The game is not easy to use and so it just is left in the case. Save yourself the trouble and buy something fun instead. ""Train your Brain"" in another way you will be happier!"
1,Very very dull,I was really looking forward to this game. I have used other brain training games on my PC and thought it would be great to do more on the train and plane. This wasn't even engaging for fifteen minutes let alone ten hours on the plane. It is gathering dust two weeks after purchase.
4,good,"this game is unlike others...it challenges ur brain in all sorts of ways, it is still very fun indead. i highly recomend it"
3,"OK for a week, boring for rest.","I believe serious gamer should leave this game alone. IMO, this game is VERY boring. I play it with my friends to compare our ""brain age"", after a week, nobody wanna play with it anymore. Cos for serious gamer, getting age ""20"" is real easy..."
5,Saving it for Easter gift,Don't really know for sure but my son played a friend's game and loved it. I will be giving it to him for Easter gift in April.
2,well it made me buy the nintendo ds console,I been looking for something that would work my brain....this game is fun but like in the other reviews there are problems with the speech recognition...but overall the game is fun....and i really like the nintendo thingy....I'm looking now for a real game to play...and I'll do a daily brain tester to see if i CAN BE 19 AGAIN!!! haha!
1,"playing games(in general) keeps your brain active you don't need a specialty ""label""","look, either watch superman or play the part! The fact of the matter is: games in general keep your brain from going doe! doe! despite the tired old stigma of ""they're all just a big bunch-o-pac man."" So just play Ultima or Final Fantasy, it's fun and they peek your interest and that alone can make one very acute(not obtuse) further(in the case of Ultima or D&D) you learn a lot too! You don't need sudocu or crossword excersizes or whatever to charge your brain, just something to peek your interest in a concrete topic!(Unlike my abstract scocial studies classes touted in dismissive bias by baby boomers!) Either read about the Pilgrams or be one!"
3,"Worth picking up used, but not new","This is a pretty fun game, and at the time it was released, the best of it's ilk. It's since (imo) been surpassed by the likes of Big Brain Academy, which really takes the genre a lot further in terms of multiplayer and content."
2,the devil is in the details,"The most important question about this game is whether the exercises have anything to do with maintaining useful brain functioning. It's true that computation is important and that cognitive flexibility is vital, but is that all there is?Even if you grant that things like humor and imagination are beyond the reach of a video game, it's hard to avoid the suspicion that the test exercises are there simply because they're easy to administer on the little console.Beyond that, the game's unreliability both in terms of voice and writing recognition makes it frustrating. If you spend most of your time trying to overcome the game's reliability, you're probably not having much fun.There was something else I wanted to say, but I forgot. . . . ."
5,Clever,"* It improved my concentration, my speed and my decision making.* It provides a loooong list of sudoku puzzles that I love.* It challenges you to improve your brain(?).* Great for the elderly, and fun.* Not for children."
3,A BIT DISAPPOINTING,"From all the ads on television and all the rave reviews that this game received, I just had to have it as well.Some things about it I like, such as the idea of doing daily puzzles ... but some things are very frustrating and annoying.The frustration comes in the fact that you are expected to drill the math problems extremely fast. Writing so quickly and not having the system recognize the number will count as an error even though you wrote down the correct answer. My writing is extremely clear and legible, but many times the game didn't recognize it correctly.I, like others, found the comments extremely annoying. I didn't care for the childish admonishments. I understood that this game was geared for adults. I don't think adults need to be told to get sleep or to eat regular meals ... please.I don't think I'll be keeping this game. It is going to find its way to Game Stop as a trade-in very soon.I'm a bit let down as I really wanted to like this game."
2,Memorized word recognition DOESN'T WORK!!!,"I love the games, UNTIL I get to the section where you memorize the words and write down as many as you can afterwards. I have purchased TWO of the Brain Age 1 games, hoping that the first one was just malfunctioning. Unfortunately, they both don't work! It doesn't matter how neatly I write the word or if I use lower or upper case! The game doesn't translate to the correct letter most of the time! And when I DO get the correct word recognized, the game often doesn't accept it! I AM SO FRUSTRATED by this!!! You would have thought that they would have tested this and gotten the bugs out!"
2,BRAIN FRUSTRATION!,"First of all, I do not have an accent or any kind of speech impediment. The only language I have ever spoke is English. BUT, the microphone interpreter on both Brain Age 1 and Brain Age 2 are terrible!! It is MOST frustrating when the mic misinterprets your answers and counts them as incorrect!!! I thought that there might be an improvement on the 2nd Brain Age, but couldn't even get past the ""rock, paper, scissors"" without the same problem. I much prefer Flashfocus or Brain Boost! Maybe it's the mic on my DS Lite. Oh by the way, my two teenagers ALSO have a problem with the microphone (and my daughter uses her own DS Lite)! Weird!! I am at the point of getting rid of the games just to recoup some of the money that I put out for them!"
2,Frustrating!,"I just purchased this game and was excited to use it. My husband used it first and he does have sloppy handwriting and had a lot of answers marked incorrect because he felt the game was unable to read his writing. I tried it and had the same problem. I have neat writing and have tried all different ways and speeds to write the answers, both the math and the word memorization. I am 37 and it ranked my brain age as 80. The system recognized all of my 0's as 5's and my k's as x's and even at times mistook s's for i's (How is that even possible?). The concept of the game is good but frustrating because you are getting the answers correct but being marked incorrect because of the game's malfunctions. If you can get passed being judged incorrectly by the game then it is good training for your brain."
3,Handwriting recognition is frustrating,"Disregarding everything else about this product, the handwriting recognition can be extremely frustrating. All of the training exercises are wholly focused on speed and poor number recognition of numbers is exacerbated by hurried, sloppy writing. Very, very often it confuses a ""5"" with ""4""; ""3"" with ""7""; and ""2"" with ""7"". I'm disappointed that the handwriting recognition is so sub-par when it's entire aim is fast-paced writing. It can make me scream sometimes to get it to recognize ""45"" as 45 (worst is about four or five tries).Handwriting aside, it's a good way to keep sharp on basic math -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division -- and other basic critical reasoning. The math reminds me of time tables from early elementary school.The sudoku is a nice bonus though."
4,Great for my brain,"I had a brain injury 4 years ago and I'm always looking for things that can help my memory. After buying this game and playing it everyday, I can tell such a omprovement in myself. It was a great purchase"
2,Rather Disappointed,"I cannot get the voice recognition function to work and therefore I cannot play any of the verbal games, only written math or Sudoku, which I do not enjoy. I expected there to be more options and definitely more reading/verbal skills building, so I really do not use this much."
4,Fun for the Family.,"BrainAge is a very fun game that gets the whole family involved. A little healthy competition between family members is good for you. :) You actually learn and improve on many things, including basic math and reading speed. I know I enjoyed it."
3,Brain Age,This game is great fun for people of all ages. There are a number of different games that rotate in and out so it keeps your interest. My only complaint is that the first game requires that you be able to speak and you have to play that game when you want to get a new brain age. Brain Academy has a wider variety of games so I actually find myself playing that more often.
4,"Enjoyable, also check out Big Brain Academy","A good variety of exercises. Sudoko games included are a real plus for Sudoko fans. Getting past the ""comments"" can become a bit tedious. The tests and practice sessions are timed so they are best done when you can focus without distractions. Give the Big Brain Academy a try, too. It's also quite good and has many, totally different exercises."
4,Great game i luv to play,"The games are great, and it is so addicting to play i play it every day. The one and only problem there is is that in one of the games if you say a color it won't take it even though you did say the color. Also, there is a similar game, and when you say the answer it won't take it. But i got to say don't let these little things stop you from buying this game. It definitly kills time on long trips, or just at home."
3,Boring after a while,"I found this ""game"" challenging for the first day and then got completely bored with it. You unlock all of the ""training"" activities after you've entered the training zone 16 times... so there's no real mystery as to what's in store day after day. I find the doctor a little annoying at times and wish he would stop saying the same things over and over again. I play soduku a lot and that's been more fun than anything else. After you reach the goal of the 20 year old brain - there's no more challenge to go after."
3,"Somewhat addicting, but limited","The game, while somewhat addicting, is limited.I'm several decades past the ""optimal"" brain age of 20, and no math whiz, but in 6 days I had scored a brain age of 21. Once that was achieved, I quickly lost interest.Other than Sudoku, there are only a limited number of ""games"" to play. And the interface is cumbersome. A ""fast forward"" or ""skip"" button would be a huge improvement."
4,Brain Age,Excellent gameSometimes it has difficulty recognising spoken wordCould do with more variety
5,Addictive,"Who knew I could derive so much pleasure from having a demented cartoon yell at me for not training my brain yesterday! The Sodoku is addicting - I've never tried paper Sodoku, but I love the electronic version."
3,interesting but getting boring afterwards,Not sure how effective it is to train your brain. I got my brain age of 70 or something but it dropped to 24 after a couple of training. It seems that you become better once you get used to it over time
3,Boring,You play the same 10 games over and over again. They are VERY boring and it only records your testing once a day. So you can't like do it over and over again unless you want to practice.
4,Brain Training,"I've been using Brain Age for 3 weeks now and look forward to daily training sessions. I think it's too early to tell if it works, but I'm having fun with it. I also purchased Brain Age 2 but haven't used that one yet."
5,great mind teaser,"I bought the DS for my 52 year old mother with the brain age game and she loves it! so easy to use; it walks you through all the instructions with comical ease. She's been playing it since Christmas and is having a blast. She started out having an ""80"" year old brain and now she's bragging that she's back into her 40's! Thumbs up game!"
3,"Fun at first, lost interest quickly.","I was excited about this game and purchased a DS Lite primarily for its purpose. The game is certainly fun for a week or so, but I pretty quickly lost interest. Parts can certainly be challenging for a while, but others are simply aggravating. Text recognition is spotty and as a result scores and progress often suffer unnecessarily. I will say the game is much more fun when several people are playing it daily and progress is compared. Even so, the novelty quickly wears off. Fun game, but more of a quick fad than anything."
4,Pretty good and educational,"Fun and educational, as other reviewers wrote the ""blue"" on the speaking task doesn't work well, it's best to practice and see what works before you take a real ""test"". Regarding accuracy I'm not sure about the ""brain age"" but it's still a good daily exervise. Overall it's pretty good and I enjoy doing my daily tasks.- I wish there were more tasks though"
4,"very interesting, not a game really.","This product is fun to use, but it is not a game, and the floating head gets creapy after a while. Good daily distraction."
3,A christmas present,Okay we bought this book for a christmas present. I was amazed at first of how everyone played it. After a month though it is not even touched. It just sits on the shelf and collects dust.
2,Annoying,"While I really enjoy Sudoku puzzles & brain games of all kinds, I found this program very frustrating. On the timed tests, it frequently misinterpreted letters or numbers and graded me down accordingly. If you do not make your numbers in the exact same way as the program (including the stylus strokes in the same order), prepare for your 4's to be interpreted as 9's etc. The scientist character makes annoying and occasionally judgmental comments regarding your progress (""feeling a little tired today?"") and if you miss training for a few days, prepare to be scolded.I appreciate the premise that exercising one's brain has numerous benefits in the short and long-term, however the ""cute"" commentary and the difficulty with character recognition was annoying enough to merit only 2 stars."
4,Good brain practice,"It's a fun way to exercise your brain. It is mostly math, some tricky color recognition (which, on our Nintendo DS, doesn't seem to work 100%, it has a problem recognizing the word ""blue""), reading, and syllable count and Sudokus. I think there is still more to it but we haven't delved into all its depth yet.Definitely a worthwhile game."
3,Fix the voice recognition problems,"We were disappointed with the game because the voice recognition problems, especially with 'blue' made it hard to get a real score. Plus, over-all, the tests were not challenging enough. Needs a higher level."
3,not bad,"Not bad, but after a while it becomes boring. You conquer the game and then it bores you. Not a bad scenario because as you age, you can always go back and play the game to test whether or not there is a decline in your cognitive skills. Nice enough game that is essential for working those brain cells!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"This game is a must for any person of any age. I am loving it. After a week, I have learned a lot about my capacity. I thought I was sharp, but needed some good training.I wish there was a spanish version."
3,Mild Fun,I thought there would be more games on this but there is just mainly simple math and sudoku. I'm hoping I just haven't found them yet. If that is what you are looking for then this game is great.
3,Challenging,I enjoyed this very much. It is very challenging and pushes you to improve your skills~ It takes a bit to get the hand recognition right but after that it goes pretty smoothly.
4,Excellent game!,I purchased this game for my husband's 58th birthday and he loves it! It was the perfect gift as not only is hethe only one playing it but our 2 young boys age 13 and 8 are also playing the game everyday for brain training. I have shown it to several friends and they are ready to purchased the game for themselves! It's a fun and challenging game especially for the person who is hard to shop for or for the one who has everything. Great gift idea!
3,fun,"like it alot, has helped my memory, sometimes it misreads numbers so your score is lower than it should be."
3,Brain Overload,"Great game for the developing mind.You get to choose from:Sudoku PuzzlesBrain Age TestingFree PlayWait, that's it?Yes unfortunately there is a limit testing your brain once a day.After that you get the ability to play the other games to unlock other ones and to keep your brain fresh.Though those also register scores once a day.In addition, the sudoku puzzles are not endless, so once you complete all of those you have nothing left to accomplish.My recommendation:Don't buy if you are expecting something to pass the time, because this game can get old fast."
5,Brain Age,"Our entire family has a Brain Age profile-we love the friendly competition of who is the ""smartest""!"
4,A Game That You Will Have Fun Playing While Learning,"Brain Age Train you Brain is a game in which you do math, sylubale counts, reading aloud and other fun things. In the game you do this and more while trying to deacrease you brain age. The lower that the age is the healther it is. While doing the certain challenge you are being timed and given a certain speed. The fastest speed that you can aqurie is Jet Speed which is EXTREMLY hard to get and the slowest is the walking speed. My personal favorite thing about the game is that you can play for 5 minutes and feel that you accomplished something. The problems with game is that the voice reconition quality is fair. Its not great but its also not terrible. And the writing reconition can be flakey at times too. But after playing this game for about a month you get tired of playing the same thing over and over. Still it is one of the best games on the DS and the $20 price tag is just icing on the cake."
3,I Guess Im Stupid...,"Oh Well, So Much For Being The Brains of The Family! This Game Is So Hard It Hurts! You Will Find Yourself Going: ""Grrrrr"" Lol its True! It Makes Me So Mad Sometimes! Its A Fun Game Tho And Its Worth Playing Even Tho The Man Keeps Telling Me Im A Little Slow?! (The Doctor Guy Looks JUST Like Someone I Know By The Way!) If Your Up For a Challenge Then This Is The Game For You! You'll Find Out How Smart You Really Are!"
2,Disappointed.,Brief and to the point. My 3's could not be read correctly 50 percent of the time. This undermines any chance of showing progress and exceeds my capacity for frustration.
5,Brain Age,I am really enjoying this game. It is exactly what I wanted. I look forward to the next Brain Age game..............
2,disappointed,"I purchased Brain Age as a Christmas gift. I feel the product could use an upgrade in the character recognition area. The numbers 4 and 9 are often confused by the program (Sudoko). x and k are also problematic (memory improvement section of the game). The penmanship of the person using the game is not sloppy. Also in the memory part of the game, the program will not accept words that are included in the list of words to remember. The potential is there, just fine tune the program"
5,Great game- fun and educational,"This is a GREAT game for the DS. It is not only educational, but very fun. My son and I played this game until 12:30am last night (over 2 hours). It is great to keep up on math facts, fine motor skills, writing, etc. He likes to try to improve his time and score each time. Good gift for anyone, young or old!"
3,stroop test not working well,It does not recognize voices well. Most of the time it does not work. It needs improvemnt.
4,Educational and informative,This is a concise assortment of the writings of Abraham Lincoln. I purchased it to donate to our local middle school library. It offers beautiful insight into the mind of the man who shaped our nation as we know it today. The selections in this book are timeless and inspiring.
5,Love my Riedel,"I love all of the Riedel glasses I have, and these are no exception. I don't find that they make quite as much difference in the flavor of the port as I've experienced when pairing wine with the correct Riedel wine glasses, but there is still a difference.Yes, the actual capacity of the glass is larger than some people might expect, but you aren't supposed to fill the glass. Typically, you only fill the glass to its widest part--this allows room for the aroma to fill the glass and add to the flavor."
3,almost...,"What a shame. Great story, great art, great scenarios... but the abilty to save this game only at 'checkpoints' is a deadly flaw. It's a visual treat and the narrative is fun, but I got so bored having to kill the same badguys over and over to get through every level that I finally gave up. I don't care who Number I is, or whether anybody saves the world, and I can't imagine anyone who finishes this ever playing it a second time. XIII may be okay for high-speed shooter fanatics, but I found it frustrating beyond words."
4,The Five O'Clock Club Job Search Workbook,"I have been a career coach for over 20 years and have seem most job search materials available. Kate Wendleton has, without a doubt, the best Marketing approach out there. From her 3 phases of the job search to the 3 phases' of networking she shows the reader how to develop an organized and personalized approach."
4,Love Kitchen Aid!,"I am so happy to have these extra slicing disks. I was surprised when the original 9-cup KA processor was packed with only the 1/8 slicing disk. But through Amazon the price for additional accessories is so good, so now I have these also."
2,this is an old silent movie - and it aint charlie chaplin,"What else can I say? I didn't realize when I clicked on this prime offering that it was a silent film - wouldn't have stopped me if it was good, I do watch subtitled films from time to time. But this thing had me annoyed at the opening credits. They lingered on the screen so long I could have got pen and ink and done all that calligraphy meself. And on the calligraphy - JIMINY- could they have made it harder to read? Kudos if u can hang on through this mess."
2,for euphorbia specialist only!,"this book is about HARDY euphorbias (E), those that can be grown in a temperate garden. (Succulent enthusiasts be warned- not for you!) the 1st 2 or 3 chapters are of interest to any gardener but then to get into the meat of the book one needs some familiarity with botany & botanical terminology; What should be the most interesting part of the book- the A-Z of hardy E.in cultivation- is far too full of irritating detail useful only to the E. specialist & would not be usable (except by such enthusiasts) for the identification of an unknown species. There are 16 pages of beautiful photos of some 40 different species but,surprisingly, there is no reference to the text and when one does look up a particular plant there is noreference in the text to the photo. there are also some 20 line drawings shown in the list of contents but there is no indication of which page carries which drawing! only to be recommended to E. enthusiasts"
5,A great book !!,"If your interested in the fine details of botanical taxonamy and identifying / cultivating Euphorbia then this is a must for your collection. Euphorbia is a difficult genus to work with and the information in this work makes life a lot easier when keying out plant materials. Contains detailed drawings of seeds and fruits and color photo's of various plants. This work is relatively small but authoratative , detailed and has a permanent spot in my botanical library. A great dollar value. Note : covers Euphorbia under cultivation so may not cover most natives in your area but will give a good intro of Euphorbia terminology that will help in identification of any member of Euphorbia. There are not that many good works on Euphorbia currently in print so when you see one , "" BUY IT "" , this is one of a few ! Pages 188 , 47 color photo's , bibliography , bw drawings, index."
2,This book should be titled HARDY Euphorbias,"This book only covers hardy euphorbia, a small part of the huge euphorbia genus. If you are interested in succulent euphorbia that grow in mild climates such as Southern California, be forewarned! This book (in my opinion) is not for you. A more accurate title for the book might be Hardy Euphorbias."
3,shabby workmanship,"so far this order has been a bad experience. free shipping always seems to take forever, what's worse is the wait and then receiving the wrong item. i cannot comment on the kydex sheath because i didn't receive it yet. probably still on it's way from taiwan. yes, can you believe that. it use to be that owning a sog was like having a piece of art work, no more. the pentagon i ordered looks great at a glance, but looking (not even closely) at it you can see buffing imperfections on the guard and minor pitting on the blade. i will keep it anyway because i will carry and use it daily, and the price was right (thank you amazon). if i had paid full price or was a collector, it would have been sent back. it feels like it will be a good work knife and hold an edge. but, remember the old sogs."
2,Rust,I had this knife only 3 months and its starting to rust. Not Good! Made in China and dont get it.
2,dvd vs cd,Somehow I missed that this was a DVD not a CD. This person is much more enjoyable to listen to than to watch.
5,Outstanding Album,"All the song on this album is exceptional, and pefectly crafted. If you are a true trance and techno geek as myself, this is a must buy. Keep it up guys..."
3,"Relaxing, but not HD","I'd say this was worth the money, but it isn't the greatest quality of video even for DVD standards. When you get one of these, make sure you order Blu-ray or it won't be worth it."
5,Beautiful Card Game!,"I agree with the other reviewer...I fancy this company as well! They have the most beautifully done games, cards, etc. and my daughter just loves them. I bought these to take on vacation and her cousins wanted them as well. I usually buy eeBoo and Haba toys for family and friends' children and the parents always tell me how much they loved their gifts. Great price, too!"
3,Knights of the Zodiac Pegasus Seiya,"This is a very cool looking toy when it is assembled!! The drawback is that while the ""armor"" is meant to be interchangeable between the horse and the person action figure, it proved to not be very durable in doing this. After just 2 or 3 times of changing the ""armor"" from the person to the horse, my 10 year old found the little tabs or nubs that hold some of the parts on started to break off in certain spots. Since the whole point of the toy is to change the armor, it should have been designed to hold up to much more use!!"
2,Hmmm.....,"Fairly typical fare for this type of cooking. I'm not sure about the dreck of the other reviews as from my trained perspective there is little here that is that outstanding or not more than available elsewhere. I'm suspect of some of these reviews, but I am happy that she has friends that would contribute these for her."
2,Not what it claims,"I was debating between this and Eat.Taste.Heal and for some reason (probably because it was cheaper), I chose this. BAD choice. I was expecting to have recipes which were dosha specific or modifications for recipes, but this book has none of that. This just seems like a cook book, with a brief explanation of ayurveda in the introduction. Many recipes use white flour, white sugar/brown sugar, and lots of various dairy products. With the little information I have received, I know this does not follow many ayurvedic practitioners' beliefs. Honestly, the recipes don't seem all that impressive. I am regretting my decision. The only reason for the 2 stars is because the seller shipped it promptly. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
4,Not low fat!,"This vegetarian cookbook thoroughly explains ayurvedic foods and style of diet as well as the three doshas. There is a chapter for novice cooks that is truly informative and helpful to those of us who never learned to cook at all. Also interesting is information on locally-grown produce, organic produce, water, and a whole list of wonderful tips on how to cook beans.My only regret is that most of the recipes use oil, butter or ghee (clarified butter) and many use salt, sugar or sweeteners - I wasn't aware of this before I read the book."
3,OK but not great,"I find this magazine hit or miss. Some months there are helpful and interesting articles other months nothing much at all. There are too many advertisements and reviews of products and vessels but then is is probably what brings in the cash, right."
1,Sailing World,I subscribed for 2 years and after 6 months I noticed that they only showed me having 6 months left. I have now spoken to them 5 times and spent more than an hour on the phone and they just told me they cant help me because they have been sold and the new owner dosn't owe me anything.
4,Down to Earth by a geologist,Excellent but very personal view of the nature of soils. Crtitique of Soil Taxonomy unjustified. Most suitable for undergraduate geology students. Fine illustration are useful.
2,Annoying....,"This mystery would have been a winner if the story had been only about Hannah. But my goodness, Kiki has got to be the stupidest, most annoying character I have had the misfortune to run across in years. I fail to understand why Hannah (or anyone else) doesn't just knock the tar out of her. While the mystery was credible enough, the character of Kiki was simply too annoying to allow me to enjoy the book. She's a person I would avoid in real life, and I will be avoiding her in the literary world as well."
2,Yes! Annoying!,I absolutely agree with the reader from Shelbyville TN. I love Hannah but I don't know if I will continue with the series because I cannot STAND Kiki. It's a shame because this author can WRITE.
5,Bellisima version,"Me encanta esta obra y la re orquestacion de Mozart es muy interesante de escuchar y esta version hace justicia a la calidad de la musica, todos los interpretes estan brillantes, es una de esas grabaciones que no me canso de escuchar y tiene una magia especial"
5,Silk is tha BOMB and SEXXY!!,"I think that people should really listen to this song. They should not just listen to the beat but listen to the lyrics. It could change your entire life! Silk has come so far in the music industry. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Not only do they sound good, but they also look good! In my opinion. Thanks lots of love from your #1 FAN Le Le in the Carolina. Keepin' it real in the Class of '99'!LCW"
5,Silk is baddder than ever,Silk cd is the .I've listen to the whole cd about a million times. I especially like If You and Meeting in my Bedroom.Silk has made a tremendous comeback.
2,Good CD but could be better.,"Who ever this new producer Silk hooked up with needs some more practice. Harmony is still the bomb but all the songs sound the same and nothing is really new. They should hook back up with Keith Sweat, there last CD was the tightest but this CD is just as bad as Blackstreets new one. I recommend Dru Hill or some classic Silk."
5,Silk HAS GOT IT GOING ON!!!!,"Their first album was good, the second was all that, and this one is ""DA' BEAST""!!!!!This is definitely music to unwind to as well as good ""baby making mood music"", without too much descriptive and graphic language, like so many other artists out there today. I AM HOOKED!!!! If they can play the life out of NEXT and 112, this album definitely deserves a shot in the spotlight!!!!"
4,jammin',I read one review by a male. He was very critical in a negative manner. I personally enjoyed the album very much. Maybe because Silk is a male group and they get sexual with much of thier lyrics the album would be more appealing to female listeners. I recommend it to anybody. It's not a waste of money. GO BUE IT.
5,PUTS YOU IN THE MOOD,This is the best R&B CD I have ever owned. If you are alone with someone pop this CD in and I guarntee clothes will be coming off by the fourth track. All the songs are great. It's a CD that you can put in and let it play the whole way through. I think a lot of people overlook this CD but if you love to hear great singing buy this CD. I promise you won't be disappointed
5,THIS CD IS BOMMMBBB,MAN I'M REALLY LIKEN THAT MEETING IN MY BEDROOM SONG AND ALL THE OTHER ONES OFF THIS CD IS A GOOD RELAXING CD YOU COULD CUDDLE UP WITH YOUR LOVED AND DO WHATEVEA :) WITH THE SONGS ON THIS CD
5,CD of the year,"I must admit on first listen, I was taken aback by the explicit way these guys put it down on 'Tonight'. Being a Silk fan from way back when, I had gotten into a serious groove on 'Silk' (their second album), so when 'Tonight' came out I expected a more relaxed and mature album. After listening a few times I found it! The ingenious way these guys have given us a little of everything is something to marvel. This album is love, lust, heartache and intense joy, in one package. AWESOME! Group and album of the year"
5,"This album was the Best , thats B, thats capital.","I think Silk is the best group around, as far as R&B. They have that rich soulful-harmonizing blend. I had the pleasuring of even meeting them. They really are down-to-earth people. They love and appreciate their fans. I know because they showed me. I loved Silk ever since ""Happy Days."" I collected over a hundred pictures and I personally took some of them. I put a lot of time and energy into my collection. I tell ya its well worth it."
2,Not quite there,The spring inside that locks into the internal rings for the various adjustments needs to be stronger. This measurer slips from one setting to another too easily. Spend the extra money for the more expensive product.
5,Nice.,"Cable was better then I expected. Its pretty stout and I would buy this again for sure. Need it buy it, you can't go wrong here."
5,It's a cable... it works.,"Nothing to write about here. It's a cable, seems to be well made and it worked for me. Don't need anything fancy for legacy devices anyways, any coax will do so look for the cheapest with free shipping through Amazon Prime."
3,Not worth it,"For the same money, you can get a superior grade cable. Would not use this on anything other than... um... I dont know. RG6 is your friend."
3,Historical info for kids,"This is a history book that describes the lives of knights in the Middle Ages. The book describes how boys could become knights, what the rules of the code of honor for knights were, and what battles between knights were like. The book introduces a lot of factual material and vocabulary, but there is no plot or story line. At the end of the book, there is a short section describing some famous knights and their dragons. Personally, I found the book a bit dry, but kids who are fascinated with swords and armor may show some interest in it. The book has about 900 words."
3,Knighthood,Yet another book detailing the page then squire to knight. Focus is on the middle ages but goes into modern knighthood. I like it. Rented it from a library.
3,If you like B-Movies......,Better than I thought it would be!If you like b-movies you will love this.
3,Good for a picture book.,"Widget is just like other children's books but is one of my favorites. I like it because it has more words then most others. It also good because the author didn't use annoying rhymes. This book has good illustrations, too. For a children's book, I would say this is good."
1,Beware!,"Don't make the same mistake I did. This is not the same ""Ron Carlson"" who is best known for his short stories, but another author by the same name. This is a actually a book of ""humorous"" Christian essays, i.e.nonfiction. Nothing wrong with that, but it ain't what I was expecting.The other review posted here is obviously written about another book and is posted here in error."
5,The River of Doubt,Simply one of the best books I have read in the last 5 years. I just could not put the book down.
4,The River of Doubt: expedition and metaphor,"The River of Doubt is about both a journey of geographic exploration, and the challenges that people set for themselves. This expedition is as much about the individuals who took part as it is about the exploration of the river.Reading the book gave me a taste of the Amazonian rainforest, the dangers of unknown exploration and a sense of the courage of most of the participants.Clearly, both Theodore Roosevelt and Colonel Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon were extraordinarily talented men.It left me with a sense of sadness that this triumphant achievement did not bring a greater sense of fulfillment to most of the survivors.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
4,Challelnging Adventures,"My book club chose this book. I probably wouldn't have done so on my own but now I am glad that I read it. I learned more than I knew before about Theodore Roosevelt's life, character and family. I also learned about some of the local natives, animal and plant life around the territory of the Amazon River. It was interesting to learn about the perils that threatened early adventurers who explored the area."
5,This was fascinating,It was interesting to read about the character of Theodore Roosevelt. What an amazing adventure that he lived to tell about.
4,well wrtten thriller,"I really liked this book. It is a harrowing journey, unbelievable in it's chaotic (and not well done) preparation. It reads quickly especially when they begin descending the river. It's hard to believe they survived at all. I learned so much about the flora and fauna of the Amazon as well as the people experiencing this expedition This is definitely a thriller and very well written. It also has an excellent index."
5,River of Doubt,Very nicely written and easy to read. One of those books you can't put down. Filled with natural and human history. A real winner!
5,excellent,"This is the first non-fiction book I have read in a loooong time. I've always been a fiction fan, but this book singlehandedly (single pagedly?) succeeded in turning me into a hardcore non-fiction devotee and minor history buff. I have not read a novel since.I gained such an appreciation for the remarkable man that Theodore Roosevelt was. By the end, you will wish with all your heart that he was still alive and available to go on a hike with you. I learned things about a river that I knew existed by map only - this book brings you in so close, you will feel like you paddled and portaged and scratched misquito bites with every person that was in those boats.A remarkable reading experience! And most remarkable of all - it actually happened!"
4,don't go there,"Some books that describe a particular place in vivid detail make you really want to visit that place. This is not one of those books. The lush descriptions of the deadly flora and fauna of the rainforest made me perfectly happy to enjoy it all from a distance. But the same descriptions make Roosevelt and his fellow explorers very real, and gave me a good appreciation for the dangers they faced and the risks they took."
4,Fascinating story of survival,"This remarkable story tells of how Theodore Roosevelt led an expedition down one of the mightiest Amazon tributaries, and lived to tell about it. Candice Millard does a fantastic job of making her readers feel as if they are actually accompanying Roosevelt and his party as they descend into the Amazonian rain forest. Her book is a fabulous account of human courage and survival, as well as a tale about the power of nature. For those of us who live comfortably in the Northern Hemisphere, it is easy to forget how vast, diverse, and deadly tropical rain forests can be. Millard brings this vicious environment to life. [...]"
4,The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey,"Insightful and engrossing. I loved reading this story of Roosevelt and his exploration of the Amazon. The sacrifices, mistakes and interactions amont the explorers were revealing."
4,A great historical story....,"Quite a different avenue of approach on this book. I enjoyed the author's ability to describe not only the journey and travails of the group that went with TR on this his last expedition, but also of the environmental consideration along the way of plant life, animal life, and idigenous people to the region. It is because of this book I am most interested in ""Thief at the End of the World"" as is on my ""to read"" list currently.This author had all the right supporting documentation for the story that had to be told, I was a little overwhelmed though at times with the environmental and subtle twist in this regard as I read. Still, interesting and I plan to read her book on the assassination of President Garfield. Extremely well written author."
4,Remarkable Adventure - Captivating Book,"Candice Millard entralled this reader with her narrative of the first known expedition down the River of Doubt, now called the Rio Teo Roosevelt, in western Brazil. Partly as a way of recovery from his painful defeat in the 1912 presidential election, and partly as bravura trek in a remote corner of the world, the author deftly interweaves natural history--wait until you read about the incredible flora and fauna in this other-worldly jungle--and the tale of ordinary and extraordinary men, especially Colonel Candido Rondon, the expedition's Brazilian co-commander (with TR). (Rondon's story could be a book by itself.) To be considered by anyone who loves stories of perserverance, natural history, and simply good writing. I look forward to the writer's next story."
2,OK.,"Could have fit the real story into about 100 pages. Instead the author gives you detailed information on what Roosevelt and his crew may have encountered in the Amazon. From fish to moss. May have seen this stuff or may not have. Good story, hard to stretch into a book IMO."
3,not so good,I thought this book was pretty much a big let down. I wish I had read roosevelts account of the adventure instead.save your money check out at the library...
2,A Soggy Experience,"On the one hand, I found certain aspects of this book interesting, mainly because I was woefully ignorant of TR's history, but I actually found out little about him, but much about his co-explorer, Rondon. The author's credentials as a writer of National Geographic articles and such is impressive but she knows little about non-fiction writing. She puts words in her character's mouths and attributes thoughts to them that I'm sure they never knew they had. As I understand it, this is a no-no in non-fiction writing and destroys the faith of the reader. None of her characters are believable. Her research was obviously extensive, but she will go off at annoying tangents, such as when she fancies herself a geologist for pages and pages, telling the reader about the earth's origins at exhaustive length. I am reading this for a book group, but I felt my progress was plodding and the book was only intermittently acceptable. Too many glaring faults for me."
3,Disconcertingly Feminine,"This is an exciting though flawed historical adventure yarn. The story of Teddy Roosevelt's journey down an unexplored and darkly dangerous branch of the Amazon makes for easy and fascinating reading. The entire voyage as well as the extraordinary individuals who accompany him, both American and Brazilian, deserve to be better known. Unfortunately, the story is told with awkward fictionalized and romanticized touches and irrelevant literary excursions. The author often travels beyond the reality of her documented sources, imagining what people were feeling and thinking. Everyone on this hazardous trip was a male and one cannot help but wish that the author were a male as well. Candice Millard brings a disconcertingly feminine perspective to what was a very masculine event."
3,Rather disappointing,"I found this book to be a disappopintment. This isn't because it is poorly written or researched. However the story is very limited in scope and there isn't much in the way of background to fill up the space. When the journey down the river ends the book likewise ends, and rather abruptly at that. The book does have some interesting information about Teddy's son Kermit and the Brazilian leader of the expedition. Not enough though to recommend this book. There are many many great books about Teddy Roosevelt that should be read before this one. There are also many many nonfiction books about explorations or ""adventure"" tales which are likewise superior to this book."
1,Overrated and lacked good story telling,"I'm shocked that this book would receive such critical acclaim. It is a surprisingly dry and dull telling of what should be an exciting and compelling story. Additionally, to call this book biographical is a stretch since the author contends only with the surface character of Teddy Roosevelt as limited to the natural and all-too-common responses to their challenges. One learns nothing of the man that wasn't already known in much greater degree elsewhere. Finally, the author continually leaves the real story to press an obvoius ideological commitment to Darwinism. It reads like a philosophical apologetic. It was, at times, as if I was reading National Geographic. Very disappointing book."
4,stranger than fiction,i am astonished at this tale. millard has perfected the art of non fiction. the only non fic book more astounding is her excellent book destiny of the republic. engrossing stuff.
4,Rio Roosevelt,"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker and I'm so glad I read it. I'm amazed at what this president did following his run in the White House. The expedition on this uncharted Amazon River tributary could have easily resulted in the death of everyone on the trip. Yet Roosevelt, his son Kermit and the rest took the river to task and emerged in real Lewis and Clarke fashion! The epilogue was a great way to quickly learn what happened to those involved in the expedition. Candice Millard's research really paid off on this true story!"
1,Sheesh,"If your looking for an adventure story then look elswhere. If your looking for a history lesson and background on every member of the party then you'll like this one. Was bored to tears from waiting for the actual exploration of the river. At the end of disc two i'd had all I could stand of the who's, what's, where's, and why's. JUST GET TO IT ALREADY. SHEESH!!"
3,TRIP OF ILL PREPARE EGO MANIACS,"WAY TOO MUCH DETAIL ON TRIVIAL THINGS, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT,IT DRAGS ON FOR A LONG TIME WITH DETAILS"
4,The River of Dought,"A fine tale that fills a gap in the biogropahies of T Roosevelt. Most readers know TR as the vigorous, sledge-hammer man and President. Millard does a fine services of letting a reader see TR as a very human person, full of fraility. Above all The River of Doubt is a good read."
2,TO UNDERSTAND THEODORE ROOSVELT,"Lays out the last chapters of Roosvelts life, good insight into the man and times. At times I thought I'd never leave the jungle. It was a differedt age."
4,Interesting read,"The story is so interseting, it could write itself. However, the author spins the tale with zeal. Each chapter is more interseting than the next."
2,River of missing pages,"Great book....couldn't put it down. But the blame for 40 missing pages goes to the author. Should have pulled the plug on the publisher and re-issued the books. It's the first time I've read a book that has 40 missing pages. Guess I'll have to search her website for the missing 40 pages. Wait. She doesn't have one. Too bad, it was a good book....I'll buy someone else's book the next time.andy may in raleigh nc"
2,Slow paced,I did not choose this book myself; it was a book club selection. I found it slow in pace and not that interesting. I found it interesting that nothing much of interest actually happened on their expedition.
4,Recalling on of Our Nation's Best,"Book review of ""Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey: The River of Doubt"" by Candice MillardWhile reading over lunch, I showed a man I work with a copy of Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey: The River of Doubt. I explained that I was enjoying it and how impressed my dad had been when I said I was reading it. ""Yep,"" he said. ""Teddy Roosevelt is every dad's favorite president.""Such a funny comment. But I can see how it might be true. The man was an adventurer, naturalist and great leader. What's not to like? This book covers a trek Roosevelt took with a team of people exploring the Amazon. The book is well-written, though perhaps a little tough to get into. Once you get hooked in the adventure and mystery that the amazonian jungle has to offer, though, you are hooked. Wonderful read!"
4,Amazing story of survival,Candace Millard's River of Doubt is well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the book. I had no idea TR was such an interesting and adventurous man. Worth the read. FYI the library of Congress has some actual film taken on the trip. Really adds to the written description.
4,"My take on ""the River of Doubt""",It was undoubtedly one of the most interesting books I've ever read. Having read little about Teddy Roosevelt made it all the more fascinating. The descriptions of the jungle were very realistic as were the hardships the all endured. I began to feel alot of it myself.
4,an adventure,I really enjoyed this book---I love Teddy Roosevelt and I love a good adventure so its hard to give this book a less than very good review.
5,A Real Gem,"I bought this book on a whim, not knowing much about Teddy Roosevelt and knowing nothing about his voyage to the Amazon region. What an eye-opening book this was for me. I learned so much about this great historical figure and his adventure. It's so much more than a history book, though. There is geography, Brazilian culture and a whole lot of Amazonian biology that together combine to form a fascinating read. While the river may be called ""The River of Doubt"", there is no doubt that the author has extensively researched this book to produce a real gem of a non-fiction read. Highly recommended."
5,Candice Millard could be my favorite historical author.,"""The whole exotic jungle became one gigantic cauldron of hatred and brutality.""""Amazons, famed women warriors who were said to have removed their right breast so that they could more effectively shoot a bow . . . (a-mazos - no breast).""Snakes, killer fish, killer insects, in gory detail. Candice Millard could be my favorite historical author. Adds dramatic tension and atmosphere. Now the last thing I ever want to do is explore jungle rivers!"
2,Price Setting Problem,This book came highly recommended but why would I pay more for the Kindle edition than for the paperback? Amazon - please adjust the price.
1,River of Doubt,The book came with no dust cover and there is page after page of sentences unlined in ink. Very distracting when trying to read the story. Did the seller even look at the book?
4,"thoughtful, well researched, well written biography",river of doubt was very entertaining. i found it to be a real page turner
4,"Ruthless, Merciless Jungle Almighty","The author (who has worked for National Geographic) significantly enhances the story of Roosevelt's expedition up the River of Doubt by contributing insightful facts about the Amazon rainforest, and she transforms what otherwise would be a not-so-incredible tale to tell into a truly fascinating survival story that includes the classic confrontations of man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. himself - - and all of this is set within a ruthless jungle where the contest of survival-of-the-fittest is played out on a hourly basis."
3,"Very dry, like a textbook","The book was not what I was expecting. The story itself is so adventurous, it could be made into a blockbuster movie. However, this book reads very slow, and is almost as if they just took excepts out of everyone's journal during the expedition.But regardless, like I said before, it's an amazing expedition, so just use your imagination to fill-in the emotions in each scene."
4,Great Book Seller,Book was in like good condition and arrive promptly.Would purchase from the seller again. Thanks.
4,Great read! Who knew Teddy was such a beast??,"I had no idea Teddy was such an adventurist. The book was a little slow to begin. I wish the book would have included more details about the dangerous foes they faced in the jungle. Overall though, the book was solid and enjoyable!"
5,"Riveting read, by one who doesn't usually like this genre","As one who is allergic (literally) to nature, explorer books aren't my forte. BUT given this one, I was engrossed quickly by the wide range of storylines. NOT just a ""how we tamed the river"", but history, sociology, biography, etc. are covered...by a writer with a superb handle on how to present her material. HIGHLY recommend."
5,New perspective on TR,"A lifelong devotee of TR. There has been very little even acknowledging TR's nearly fatal trip in the Amazon. Ms. Millard has presented an outstanding work on this aspect of his life.She has brought the drought of the highlands and darkness of the jungle to life in this book. I was so taken by it that I went through it twice for fear I had missed something of great import.This book presents all sides of TR, the naturalist, the politician, the reformer and the self-sacrificing idealist. His desire to commit suicide rather than be a burden to the supply strapped expedition is treated with great respect and acknowledges, that TR held himself to the same high standards he expected in others.I can only say, Ms. Millard, Job Well Done!"
3,Thoroughly Disappointed,"A great story but only an average telling. The book suffers from poor editing, very repetitive writing, sloppy scholarship, narrative building that seems to include inventing thoughts and opinions not based upon historical evidence, and a complete failure in fleshing out the characters so that they never seemed quite real or relatable. The book is fine for a reader who never reads history, but as someone accustomed to reading the works of historians, I was left very turned off by Candice Millard's great deficiencies in this area."
4,Worth a read,"I am very impressed by the amount of research and work it must have taken to put this book together. Given Millard's national geographic editorial background, I expected there to be detailed descriptions of the wildlife in the Amazon. Her historically accurate accounts of what happened exactly and who said what to whom also impressed me. My only criticism would be that the book didn't read very smoothly (like a novel) at points. She seems more concerned with the book being a historical snapshot plus explanation on nature plus personalities. A little bit of hyperbole and color to make it seem a bit more adventurous would have made it an easier read. All that being said, the book is definitely worth a read for anyone who likes the Amazon, Teddy Rooseveldt, South America, nature, etc. I would recommend it to friends."
5,Fantastic! A real page turner,"This is a terrific book! It is meticulously researched, informative and engrossing. I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to gain an insight into either the personality of T.R. or what it was like to explore a river in the Amazon in the early 1900s."
5,Candice makes hietory into a thriller!,Candice has written a beautiful book. I have bought 3 through Amazon for friends they all love it.
5,Detailed,Excellent read. It tells the story of a man who needed thrills and got them in excess on what was his last major adventure. The story revolves around Roosevelt but it covers the life within the Amazon River valley as well. Hard to put down.
4,Impressive Tale,"When reading about Theodore Roosevelt one question comes to mind...Why have we become such wimps? His was a giant personae, one who backed up his talk with action. Read this book and you'll quit bellyachin' about that annoying hangnail."
5,"Actually, 4 1/2 stars...","River of Doubt is a wonderful book for armchair travelers, those interested in truth-is-stranger-than-fiction history, or those of us who admire Teddy Roosevelt. The book has two problems though. First, there were no decent maps included to follow the expedition's course. Second, Millard becomes repetitive and boring with her continuous mutterings on how sick everyone was. Her overstated descriptions of illnesses begins to sound like filler and takes away from an otherwise excellent book. However, I still highly recommend it. Enjoy!"
5,A Triumph,"This book has everything one could want in a nonfiction book. The fact that it was Teddy Roosevelt who made this perilous journey is almost secondary to me. What I enjoyed most was the way the narrative went into detail about all the people undertaking this expedition, as well as detailing the environment they were journeying through. Millard wrote exquistly of the flora, fauna, and native people that inhabited the area around River of Doubt. Her narrative also enables you to feel the effects of the deprivations that the expedition toiled under. The whole experience was triumphantly wrought."
5,What a story!,"This is the first book in a long while that I could not put down. It was fascinating, and it is unbelievable that it is true. Makes one wonder why TR voluntarily subjected himself to this journey. It was so interesting to me because this book plays up the fears we all have of the wildlife of the jungle like snakes, crocs, spiders, insects, etc., it adds the unknown natives and the thoughts of what they might do to this group, and, even better, it explores the personal conflicts between members of the group. The Americans, as usual, misunderstood their foreign hosts, and soon found out that they could not go it alone. I so thoroughly enjoyed this book that I then read all of the ones written by this author, and they are just as great in their own way. I hope she keeps writing!"
2,For whom is it written?,"There is something charming with this book listing a large number of animals and explaining how they are used in Japanese sayings. However, it's difficult to imagine who the targeted reader might be. A beginner cannot possibly use it. There is no word to word translation and no explanations of unusual syntax or grammar. An advanced student on the other hand, would be disturbed by the persistent transcription of every single character. For an advanced student this is just a waste of space. The translations to English contain far too much slang to be useful for a non native English speaker. I'm not interested in all the strange ways you can express the origiginal Japanese in English. I'm just interested in what it actually means, and unfortunately this book more than once fails to convey that."
2,What's wrong with retailers?,They shipped a damaged watch and now say they don't have any more of these. Why did they sell it in the first place if it was damaged and unsatisfactory? A young boy is very disappointed with his birthday gift.
2,its ok,"i have used this thermometer at work for my tempura pot oil for the last 3 years, it is the 3rd time i purchase one and it does measure temperatures accurately, but the downfall is that its a fragile device. 2 days after receiving it the glass has already cracked(which is the first time it has lasted such a short lifetime. Now I am looking for a new thermometer where I can count on durability. Any suggestions?"
1,Not good for candy,I bought this and blindly followed the temperature indicated. When the candy started to turn color way early I compared the temp to a mercury thermometer and it was 20 degrees off! I'm returning it.
2,Taylor: not so accurate.,"As with all products when I got this one I put it to the test to see whether it would give an accurate reading of boiling water at 100 degrees Celsius. It was five degrees shy of 100. It's recommended the probe sit in at least 2 1/2 inches of liquid to get the most accurate reading. I did just that. It still wouldn't come up to temperature. Figures, it's made in China.It's an okay thermometer. I needed a thermometer for shallow deep frying (about 1 inch of oil) and this seemed to be a good middle of the road choice. Turns out, if less than 2 1/2 inches of the probe sits in liquid, it only reads the about average temperature of what it's submerged in. The heat climbs slowly up the shaft of the probe to give the median temperature."
5,Accurate at high temps,"Great thermometer. not as accurate at low temps, but that's not why I bought this item. Great for candy making, and very accurate at higher temps."
1,Needs to be immersed about 50%,"I assume it's accurate, but my problem is that for 7-minute frosting, the amount of sugar syrup in the pan is so small that this thermometer cannot read accurately, rendering it useless for my purposes."
1,inexpensive but inaccurate,"This model, though reasonably priced, does not do the job. Over about 200 degrees F the needle bends toward the face and gets somewhat stuck. Pushing past 300, it appears to be at least 20-40 degrees lower than another brand I have. Therefore if you think that you are frying at 350, it might really be almost 400. The only plus is that it has good length and clip, so a replacement should have the same dimensions. The more accurate one I have is too short."
3,Don't get me wrong...,Don't get me wrong the content is great............reading it is not so great. This was a very boring read. Content focused on Western international social work.
3,dvd,"good movie, very descriptive, should be told as one whole story not broken up and segmented. played well just long on some stories i am not interested in"
3,good but incomplete,"i appreciate Mark Knopfler's fitting compoition and the jingle-jangle Django lounge tunes as much as anyone should. I like all the instrumental tracks to this album. But it is lacking in some of the edgy punk that reflected the current setting of the story, which contrasted that much more with the suburban lifestyle. Remember the Subverts? Where are they on this album? I hate when some of the best, hardest-to-find songs of a movie are left out of a soundtrack."
3,A good Soundtrack to a Very good film.,"Firstly, see the film. I was changing channels one night and found this on IFC and saw that Emma Watson and Christian Bale were starring. Really enjoy watching those two actors so I decided to watch the movie. Watched it in its entirety and couldn't understand why I had never heard of the film before. Set in England and really pretty to watch I found that I also really liked the songs that were in the background. I especially like the Knopfler tune 'Metroland' which plays during the end credits. I just liked the film and thought the songs were good and bought the album. One of the other reviewers described it is elevator music and I agree. It's just a nice CD to put on when relaxing on those slow nights after a stressful day."
3,Rotary Hydraulic Closer,"The closer has closing force that adjustable but very coarse. While the closing action is very smooth and fluid for my light weight screen enclosure door , there is no anti-slam damping/cushion prior to fully closed. This results in a door slam every cycle."
4,At last a stereo with bluetooth input,"All the bookshelf stereos I have looked at were either toodeep to fit on a bookshelf, or hideously ugly. And I was toldby salesmen at Best Buy that there exists no stereo that wouldplay music from a PC via bluetooth.This system looks reasonably stylish, fits on a bookshelf easily,takes bluetooth input (and it says it will send its output toheadphones via bluetooth, although I haven't tried it), andoverall produces great quality sound."
2,Sony CMT-HX7BT Micro Component System with Bluetooth and Satellite Radio Capability,"The design is very good, it is small, has good look , but the sound is very bad, the highs have a weird peak, and annoying when you listen music with a lot of acoustic guitar."
1,VERY VERY VERY HALF A**!!!,"Why don't you get everybody else to write and perform for you and you just produce. You lost it Dave. I was (was) a big Sanborn fan for years but you have lost your Sanborness. Keep Marcus on your side but demand the power of such monumental tracks such as ""Run for Cover"" or ""Hideaway"". This isn't a bad CD if your positioning for Kenny G's pop sax(sickening) domination."
1,Boring,"Well,Sanborn did a great job to ""impress"" people with his repetitious funk licks.All the tracks here don't have any soul and passion,it's just commercial playing.And I don't understand why ""Jazz purist"" claim he is a living legend.For goodness sake can't you all hear that?he is just up to impress people with his loud and noisy tone and some boring nursery licks.He is lack of harmonic ideas and is expert in playing blue scales(but he manage to reshape the simple blue scales to deceive you kids).He is just like one of those Eric mariential,Nelson Rangel and Everette harp craps.If ""Jazz Purist"" out there wanna upgrade yourself,listen to the real masters,Branford Marsalis, George Garzone and Joe Lovano."
2,Dave you missed me on this one partner!,"Dave, Dave, Dave, I think I've finally figured you out. I should buy every other CD right? Sting, Benet, Hathaway and Wilson bring nothing, I repeat nothing to this CD. Cassandra Wilson has an absolutely magnificent voice, a treasure, but it's not the VOICE I want telling me about their ""Daydreaming"". Since this is a pop/RB CD with saxaphone fills, why not Chante Mooore on vocals, yeah, she can tell me about her daydreams and anything else on your mind, perfect vocal style for the song. Now I'm daydreaming, excuse the digression, back to the point. It's the horn we want to hear, the Sanborn horn. The soulful, blow the spit out Sanborn horn unsandwiched between made for radio vocals. On a positive note, thanks for the update of ""Lisa"" (Straight to the Heart, 1984), truly rendered with all spirit and feel of the original...now that's Sanborn!!!"
3,Pic is decieving,"Purchased the item for like $24 or so, I thought I was getting all the plates but instead only got 1. Definitely not worth that price."
1,would NOT reccomend,"we bought this for my son on his 4th birthday....he likes golf and we thought it would be a good gift to go with his first real set of golf clubs. item was bought, put together, battery fully charged. he was excited hopped right on and went nowhere. the thing is a pice of junk he only weighs 31.lbs and on a level lawn it would not go in grass that was cut the previous day. only 1 back wheel pulls and it simply doesnt have the power to go, perhaps it would go better in the driveway. we were expecting alot more. he has other ride on toys...john deere tractor hes had for 2 years and the thing runs great. i would not recommend this unless it will be used strictly in a driveway/garage area...not many golf courses made of concrete though."
3,Good,It is fairly good purchase and a good buy. The book is in good condition. But the time it took for delivery is a bit long. Hope the delivery can also be carried out on the weekend if the buyer is in urgent need of the book
3,"Perculation can be, and is, a whole lot better","First off, I think Pleasurehead is one of the top DJ's in the world. That having been said, this mix is mediocre. Prior to ""Generator"", all other Pleasurehead mixes were released independently and those are outstanding. Each one of the five underground mixes sounds obstensibly different, but they all contain P-head's nearly-trademarked deep-bass, rave-oriented style and knack for sampling. On ""Generator"", though, it is almost as though the label is trying to get Pleasurehead to sound like Pleasurehead. In other words, this mix sounds like he took the creativity and subtle genius of his underground stuff and clumsily threw it all together. Nothing really stands out here, and it falls far short of the energy of ""Trance Perculation"" and ""Electronic Illusions"". If you like Tiesto, Carl Cox, Dj Irene, etc., then I guarantee you'll love Pleasurehead; just not necessarily this album."
3,"Classic Jones, but...","Many Jones fans are awaiting (including myself) a good release of his Musicor work. While this serves as a good sampler, it is lacking in several respects. First of all, as I mentioned, this is Musicor work, so ""Race Is On"" and ""White Lightning"", for instance, are not presented in their original form. While that's not bad for us fans of his Musicor work, it's not really the ""hit"" version. Another complaint is evidence of vinyl sources show through on every song. It's not to say that the sound quality is ""bad"", but you're really not getting any better than a vg++ vinyl version of the music. Until a better Musicor retrospective surfaces, this one is, even for all of the faults that are highlighted, a must have."
5,one of the better ones,"What can I say? George Jones, legend of country, has about fifty million greatest hits albums. If they combined his actual ""best"" songs into a set and disposed of the mediocre ones it would be great.Nonetheless, I do have to say that this one is excellent throughout. All good classic Jones tunes. Usually his hits albums have three or four really outstanding songs and then the rest is filler. Not so with this one. A truly fun recording!"
3,Excellent Performance and recording BAD CD!,"The recording and performances are unparalleled, but curiously, the technology used to ""remaster"" this form of CD does not allow it to be added to iTunes in any format ... it ""rips"" or ""loads"" but the music is guarded against copy, and becomes completely distorted and unbearable to listen to. The CD does not even PLAY directly from the disk on the computer in iTunes, Real Player, or Media Player. It would only play for me in a standard standalone CD player attached to the Stereo System."
3,Media Via,"The reviews of this CD are wildly split, justifiably so, but a reward is in store for anyone who can figure out how to purchase on a track-by-track basis (nudge-nudge, wink-wink).This writer's bias is that he loves middle-period T-Tech stuff (Illicit/Face First/Reality Check), in which their powers of composition were jaw dropping, sans any synth-garbage background that is only mildly bothersome on the earlier discs. So I was as disappointed as anyone when the post-Reality Check freeform approach became this quartet's standard.You might still need to experience ""repeated listenings,"" as suggested by other reviewers, but one would do well to take four bucks out of one's pocket and rip 'Sheik of Encino,' 'Party At Kinsey's,' 'Slick,' and 'Jalapeno.' The playing therein is as mean-spirited as anything these guys have produced to date."
1,"Sorry, Scott & C........","I am a longtime fan for Tribal Tech and must say that, (MY HUMBLE POINT OF VIEW!) despite any effort spent in trying to ""understand"", to get ""in tune"" with this record, the ""thing"" does not fly: there's no music! It seems to me just an updated version of the old free jazz (superboring) experiments of the seventies! This is the demonstration that music has to be (possibly well) written and organized before, despite any possible ""telepaty"" between the musicians; only then one can be free to break all the rules and go wild. Not worth. Get all the old T.T. records before they go out of catalog!"
4,Very Well Done!!!,"I had never heard of Tribal Tech until i somehow stumbled upon them. I downloaded alot of songs from early albums. I like them so I got this cd. The cd is very very well put out. It shows alot of great talent, The only reason why it didn't get a 5 star rating is because it lacks the depth of real songs. The older songs seemed to have more to them because they weren't right off the top of the heads of the musicians. Very good album but i would suggest purchasing an earlier album before this one."
3,I give it three stars because,"It does not seem to work with my outdoor amplified tv antenna. I do not know if it is the antenna, the amplifier box or the coaxial cable and because of that I can not give it five stars."
2,Meh,"First of all, my friends and I love to play Bang! The original game is easy to learn and rounds go quickly.Re: Dodge City, the effects of cards are explained well in English, as opposed to using icons. That is a plus.Now, for the minus. The new characters are overpowered (one allows any card thrown act as a ""miss"") and the new deck has too many misses and other bonuses that make people harder to hit. Basically, players become indestructible tanks. Games become much, much longer; I think the quick pace of the original was one of its best attributes.I'd recommend getting the other expansion: ""A Fist Full of Cards""."
1,Never Thought I Could Not Like Something By Fleetwood Mac,"There is so much potential for an incredibly great story here....Mick's life, his daughters, high friends, jeesh....even Christine is interviewed a lot here, not to mention Peter Green......wish Jeremy could have been part of this.....and why not talk to the later-day Macs like Dave Mason? Even the best licks and lyrics are thin.....ok so they got Stevie singing silver spoon at the right moment (duh!), but there were so many opportunities for really great segments from the old films and tracks......the band is always about the music and there simply wasn't enough of it to make this a great DVD. Is is worth it for the serious fan? Of course it is, which is why I can recommend it, but if you are looking for insight into the band I would suggest starting with the Dance DVD first.....it's somewhat biographical and definitely not the same as the CD."
1,Who cares? Just give me new FM music.,"I didn't purchase this DVD and I don't plan on it. I may be out of line as I write the following since I didn't watch the DVD:There have been so many FM biographies. How many times will each member going to tell the stories of the Rumours era, leaving the band, re-joining the band, the plethora of drugs, the luxuries, etc.I've been a fan of their music for 15 years. It's time that they move on and stop talking about their indulgent past."
4,"Form, Fit, & Function - done well.","First, the product was delivered on-time, however the packaging was not adequate for protection. The upper bowl portion was slightly crushed onto the lower stand, however I was able to pop the unit back in place without damage.The colander performs very well. I appreciate the smooth stainless steel construction for easy cleaning without cuts or scrapes. The lower stand is also well constructed. Bottom line: I immediately donated my two other plastic colanders."
5,Good product,Was looking for a large colander that wasn't plastic and wouldn't discolor or rust. This was recommended by Cook's Illustrated. Have used it a few times and so far I've like everything about it.
5,The best choice,An America's Test Kitchen #1 choice is terrific. No puddling at the bottom and the holes are small enough to keep finer sized food slipping through.
5,Drains better than other colanders,Bought on recommendation from Cook's Illustrated. Other colanders always left water in the bottom but this one drains perfectly.
2,Not quinoa-friendly,"Despite the description, the holes are just large enough to let some grains of uncooked quinoa fall through. I rinse quinoa all the time, and am disappointed in this collander."
4,Drains great...,"This colander drains extremely fast, but still keeps thin items like angel hair pasta from catching in the holes. It's stainless, so it cleans up nicely. I'd give it a 5, but I was a bit disappointed that it had welded rather than riveted handles. I thought I'd get riveted at that price, but maybe I'm out of touch with reality. 5 stars for drainability, one star reduction for the handles."
4,Sturdy Colander,"I purchased this colander after having read ""Cooks Illustrated"" positive review about it's performance, design, and value. It does appear to be well made and is certainly sturdy. The test of time will tell how well made it is and whether or not it corrodes -- but so far so good. I feel that it was a good value."
5,A colander that performs admirably,"This colander is plenty big, drains quickly and sits solidly in my sink without tipping over. I like that the bottom of the colander is flattened and that there is about an inch if space between it and the bottom of the base. That helps to prevent water from backing up into the colander, which can be a problem when a colander has a round bottom that almost touches the surface on which it is placed. The product is lightweight, which a few people have criticized, but that should be expected, since it is mostly holes!Minor quibbles: My item arrived with a few tiny blemishes in the finish, none bad enough for me to return it. I agree with other reviewers that the handles could feel more substantial. Finally, it should be noted that the product is made in China, not Korea, as stated in Amazon's listing. Overall, though, a fine colander that is far superior to the one it replaced."
5,"A colander that drains perfectly, doesn't lose any food","One of the most-used items in my kitchen. Love it that spaghetti, peas, orzo don't fly down the drain, which is what would happen with my previous colander. And it drains out the liquid very efficiently. I am following the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated and hand-washing, which is easy as long as you wash promptly."
4,Underwhelmed,"After all the hoopla I've been reading about this product, I expected something so unexpectedly spectacular that it would knock my socks off.Having said that, I love the small holes throughout the colander. However, at $32 I thought that the product would be more substantial. I may be wrong but it doesn't look like stainless steel; it's looks like cheap aluminum from the five and dime store. It is very light weight and the handles look cheaply made.I haven't drained anything yet so I can't give you the results of the draining in the sink test yet.Overall, I was underwhelmed. I'm being generous with four stars simply because of the nice small holes. It's really a 3 star product."
5,Nice Colander,"I had been looking for a good colander and this one fits the bill perfectly.Works very well, is easy to clean and looks good hanging by the sink. A little expensive but worth it."
5,Fantastic! She's a Honey!,"I feed many, and this Colander is, pretty darn nice for the price. I've owned enough colanders to tell, that this one will last a lot longer than the dozens of others I've owned over the past 45 yrs of cooking. I really like the way it takes care of any kind of noodle out there, potaotes are a snap, and when I can my veggies, pouring an 18qt pot of water, with it's contents through this colander, it's no problem at all. I use this colander every day, and since I had the chance to use the one my friend purchased, I knew it would be good. I think you will like it too. It's not of the ""top of the line"" variety, but it works really well, holds a lot of anything you need to drain, and that's what we all need. Stainless Steel is a clean, safe way to cook, and for me, that says it all too."
3,Good but not Great!,This colander would be great if the handles were not welded....I am just waiting for it to fall apart. Also be careful not to dent.
3,Worthwhile for the serious Burroughs collector,"This book is useful overall for it's illustations and descriptions of various editions -- nearly all early hardcover American editions of ERB's novels and stories, it appears, as well as a selection of paperbacks. When it was first available, in the pre-Internet days, there probably weren't any single sources where you could get all this information together, with all the nice pictures. I haven't done a lot of web research to be sure that one can in fact find all of this information easily even now, so the book may still have some general usefulness.Unfortunately, though the editing and production throughout are rather shoddy, even amateurish - and the prices quoted often seem astronomical even a decade after I bought the book. Perhaps these are auction house estimates? In any case, worth hunting down for the hard-core collector, if one can find it relatively cheaply."
3,"Good photos of the outside, almost nothing on the inside","This book has a lot of photos of C-130s, from the old snub nosed 130A's to the familar H and J models, and from most of the countries that fly the Herky Bird; but I was disappointed that there were only about three photos of the inside (cargo bay) and none of the cockpit."
3,"Airplane Profile Book, but that's about all","Like most other Shiffer Books, this book is a disappointment to the veteran and anyone else who really would like to know something abuot the subject. While Chris did a good job of compiling photographs and basic facts about the various models of the Hercules, there is very little in the text about what the airplanes and the crews who have flown them have really done to make the C-130 one of the most famous airplanes to ever fly. If you like pictures, buy it, but if you're interested in what the C-130 is really all about, look elsewhere.Sam McGowan..."
5,Really worth buying,"Thomas Hampson and Samuel Ramey have been for the last few years among the most demanded opera stars and this recording is up to their usual high standards. I have seen several of their performances.No Tenors Allowed contains 8 well known duets from operas by Cimarosa, Donizetti, Bellini, and Verdi. There has been some quibbling because, one of the duets (from Don Carlos) is in French rather than the advertised Italien.On the classical music newsgroups, there have been many messages about this CD, almost unanimously favorable.I would strongly recommend that anyone interested in opera should buy this great CD."
3,Would have been great minus Ramey...,"What can I say about this CD? Well, I can start by explaining why I ranked it 3 stars. The only thing worth listening to on this CD is Hampson, and I figured that 2.5 stars would be appropriate, considering that, but I couldn't choose anything besides whole stars for the rankings. So, I rounded up and got 3.Seriously, though, Samuel Ramey has about the most boring bass voice in opera today. Watching him perform the lead bass role in Sussanah was like pulling teeth. On the bright side, Thomas Hampson has an excellent instrument and is a pleasure to listen to. It's no wonder, then, that these types of bass/baritone CDs are rarely produced - they're simply too boring to deal with. Especially Ramey."
5,Better Than Expected,"Ok, if you are looking for a flashlight to use as a duty light for traffic stops and building searches then this is probably not what you are looking for. It would certainly be adequate for those tasks, however, when your life is on the line, pay the premium for a good streamlight or surefire.With all that out of the way. This is very good, surprisingly bright LED flashlight than runs on standard AA batteries which is a big plus. I am not a big fan of the cheap little carrying case, however, you are better off throwing a lanyard around it anyway. This is an excellent light for camping, house tasks and the like. I have not had any issues with the rubber switch and find that it works very well."
3,I Couldn't Wait To Finish This Book And Throw It Away!,"I love true crime books and this one is very good. It is a quick read with many real life cases that are written well and interesting. The only problem is that each story is horrific. I am usually pretty numb to reading about violence and murder, but this book took it to a different level that I wasn't really ready for and did not enjoy. As a true crime book, this was nearly perfect, however I can't give it a perfect score because it made me feel disgusted and sick."
2,Food Processor Pusher fail,"Same issue for me on the pusher. The design change KitchenAid made in 2009 (leaving the part number the same, of course) does not allow the old pusher to fit in the new work bowl cover. You have to get a new pusher if you replace the work bowl cover. Fortunately, KitchenAid was gracious enough to send me the replacement [new] pusher free of charge when I explained this to them."
3,Ich hab mein Herz in Heidelberg verloren,"Hey Guys!The translation of the title ""Ich hab mein Herz in Heidelberg verloren"" ist ""I've lost my heart in Heidelberg"" and it's not a story about Hertz experiences, it's about a man who's telling how he had fallen in love in Heidelberg. I just wanted to tell u this so you now what this song really is about. I please u to excuse my writingmistakes in this text, but I'm an original German not wearing lederhosen ;-)....PS: The song Lilly Marleen is not the best drink song,thats true but the writing with double e is correct, cause its a dialect...have fun,bye"
4,"SAMUEL FULLER, OPUS 22","**** 1989. Based on David Goodis'sStreet of No Return, this motion picture was co-written and directed by Samuel Fuller. A rock singer falls in love with a young girl who's the mistress of a real estate crook. He has his throat cut by his rival and becomes soon an alcoholic and a bum. Last movie of Fuller that deserves, in my opinion, to be rediscovered. The production design is superb and the mood of the film pays tribute to the universe of David Goodis. Even if the film may seem a little static in comparison with our contemporary standards (are they so good, anyway?), STREET OF NO RETURN ends magistrally Samuel Fuller's filmography. Highly recommended."
4,PRETTY GOOD,"Good price for collection; however, not this best quality. Now what you are getting when you buy old film/VHS transferred to DVD. Not digitally remastered. Really good Samurai stuff."
5,Kurosawa Movies,"Every one who likes Cenema, should see/have this collection by the great One Akira Kurosawa."
3,Great Set ... Disappointing for Widescreen TV-Owners,"This is a great set to own - 4 of Kurosawa's great films in one reasonably-priced box set. Criterion does a great job with the bonus stuff, and quality of film transfer. The sound on these is mono, so there's not much more tweaking that Criterion could have done in that department.My biggest qualm is that 2 of the 4 films are not Anamorphic. Those of you who have widescreen tvs will know what I'm talking about. YOJIMBO and SANJURO, both 2.35:1, are not presented with an Anamorphic (or ""enhanced for widescreen TVs"") option.HIDDEN FORTRESS is Anamorphic.SEVEN SAMURAI is 1.33:1 standard format, so it will appear ""square"" anyway.I was very disappointed to discover this after I bought the set. I understand that Criterion is now trying to release their titles in Anamorphic format. However, I wonder if they'll ever go back and re-release YOJIMBO and SANJURO this way?"
4,Great book,"For anyone wanting to explore their spirituality in the Indu tradition, this is a great work to help on your journey"
3,Great combination of country and easy listening music,"Dan Seals is one of those country artists that is none for his hit ""Bop."" Unfortunately, this song is what he is known for. There are many wonderful songs in his catalog including ""I'd Really Love to see you tonight"" and ""One Friend."" His first album of In a Quiet Room was super. His soulful acoustic reneditions of his songs was moving. His follow-up is also very good. Unfortunately, his material isn't as strong on his first. Nonetheless, if you enjoyed his first album, then you will likely like In a Quiet Room II."
4,We are One video CD? was a great success at ASCA. I want one,"Dan Seals gave a great speech at the American School Counselor Conference in Phoenix in June. He shared his faith and the WE ARE ONE music video, and there were few dry eyes in the group. I am looking for a copy to use with students and staff before school starts Aug 11, 1999."
3,The Best Best Man,"Contains some useful information for a ""best man"" who has never been to a wedding. This is another British wedding book with limited advice for anyone in the U.S."
1,Great if your are a Britt!! Of no real use to me in the US,I have been trying to find as much info as I can about being a best man. This is NOT the book to use. Although it does have minimal redeeming value it has a real English slant. I would not recommend this book.
3,10 Videos- Great Bargain,"Rereading my original review I realized it was not complete. There are 10 videos, each with two half-hour stories. This is a small price to pay for 20 vintage Sherlock adventures."
4,Orginal Holmes Series,"This series is fun and exciting. Very orginal scripts, but there are at least two stories based on the orginal stories - The Red Head League and the meeting of Holmes and Watson, but I can't remember the title of that episode.Overall, a very entertaining series, not as good as the Brett series or the Rathbone/Bruce movies, but it is well worth your time to buy it, I really like the Watson character and Lestrade, but Howald as Holmes takes a little to get use to."
5,"Romance, Love & Lust Well Written","After having read Love at my Fingertips which preceded Abiding Love, I didn't think a sequel could hold my attention any more than the original story, but it did. The interplay among the characters was nicely expanded and the love between the two main characters, Jean & Thomas, was brought out to the reader vividly & evoked a response identifying this reader with the ones about whom he was reading. I especially liked the chapters with Mickey Waters, the fisherman character, because I was familiar with the lake in New Hampshire mentioned in the story. The ending was extremely well done, and kept me guessing. Kudos to the author. I hope she writes another winner."
4,"My dog loves it, but it makes me nervous","I have an Australian Cattle Dog mix who is a year and a half old and a very heavy chewer. She DESTROYS most toys. I found this bone on sale at Target and decided to give it a try. She had the Nylabone puppy key teether and enjoyed those. I was surprised how hard this bone is - like a rock - but she LOVES LOVES LOVES it! It sounds awful while she chews it and I constantly worry that she's going to crack or break a tooth while chewing. I know it's supposed to help clean their teeth and gums, but I noticed that it ripped up the roof of her mouth pretty bad after a long chewing session - to the point where parts of the ridges on the top of her mouth were completely gone.I might try to see if I can find slightly softer bones of this nature for her to chew on - just for my own sanity. I'd hate to think she could damage her mouth or ruin her teeth on this toy. She gives this bone 5 stars, I give it 3 - so we're averaging a 4."
5,Happy with this Nylabone,"My GSD is happy with her new Nylabone chew bone. She had the smooth one last time and seems to like this one even more, great for keeping those teeth clean."
5,Keeps Dogs Busy,"My black lab puppy loved this. It was her favorite toy and she chewed on it all the time. It keeps dogs busy so they are not trying to chew up your house! It lasted a long time, although she did get it chewed down to a tip (she is a very strong chewer). I do not think she ate any of it and it did not hurt her. But, as with any toy, you should supervise your dog while it is chewing on the toy."
5,Long Lasting,I ordered this for my lab mix that loves to chew. She is a strong/heavy chewer and usually goes through toys in a matter of hours. This has lasted several months and will probably last many many more.
4,Perfect for our little puppy,I bought this after reading the reviews and I am so glad I did. Our puppy loves it! It is a little costly for a bone but it has stayed in one piece and she is a chomper. It's definitely less expensive than buying raw-hides or any other bone she can eat. If she ever breaks this one apart I will definitely purchase another one to replace it.
1,Not for a really agressive chewer,My dog loves to chew! I figured a product created specifically for dogs that love to chew would be perfect. Rocky actually ATE this bone. And then proceeded to throw up pieces of nylabone the next morning. Horrible! If your dog is an agressive chewer do NOT purchase this product.
3,Quality product but smaller than expected,"One of the best pieces of advice I received when I got my puppy was to expose her to Nylabone products. They are one of the few dog toys that, 6 years later, she doesn't destroy within 5 minutes. This item was much smaller than I expected, making the price, along with shipping, not such a great buy. The term ""wolf"" was misleading. Could of purchased same item in pet store for this price. Better for a small, maybe medium sized dog."
1,Not sturdy enough.,My little 60 pound Chessapeake had it torn the 4th time we let her play with it. Not very sturdy.
3,Not a good replacement for rawhide bones.,"I have a 60 pound black lab that is a big chewer and thought that these might be a good replacement for the rawhide bones she loves so much. She doesn't like these at all. She has barely touched it in the four weeks she has had it. I'm giving this 3 stars because it is made well and maybe some dogs do like them, just not mine. So I'm still looking for something she can enjoy but not devour in 1 or 2 hours. Also tried one of the edible Nylabones, this she liked but it was gone in less than 10 minutes."
5,"Dog loves it, durable","My nine month old golden retriever acts crazy at times. When we give him this toy, he will lay by our feet and chew on it while we watch tv and relax. He doesn't seem to bore of it as he does with other toys. He has chewed on it quite a bit and it is still in good shape. Highly recommended and only $10."
3,Sturdy but a bit dangerous,"I got a few Nylabone products for our new doggie, a pit bull mix. He loves them, but the problem is after chewing for a while, the chewed areas can get really sharp, which have scraped his gums a couple times. Nothing severe, but definitely don't want my dog to be hurt by a chew toy. Nylabones do seem to be very durable, and have not just fallen apart upon use, which is a good thing. He enjoys chewing them, but I probably won't buy anymore after he finishes the ones he has due to the sharpness problem."
4,She likes it,"The novelty wore off, but she liked it and it kept her busy a while. A little peace and quiet for me!"
1,8 month old lab chewed in a few hours.,Our 8 month old lab puppy was able to chew this entire thing in less than a few hours. This is not a durable toy for good chewers and it does not last long. If you have a powerful chewer this is not the toy for your dog
1,My dog won't play with it.,"My puppy loves to chew on things but he won't touch this one. I would not buy this again ever,"
1,"Received wrong product, but more importantly: Not safe for dogs!","My dogs love nylabones, and we've been buying them for years. I recently decided to stock up and ordered 4 nylabones! They arrived quickly, but one of the packages was partially open. They also had a new textured look that I wasn't sure my dogs would like. The picture indicated that the product I would be receiving would be the same untextured nylabones that my dogs love.However, those aren't the only reasons I'll be returning them. We just took one of our dogs to the vet this week, and had to spend almost $1,000 getting two cracked teeth removed! Our vet said that nylabones are too hard for dogs' teeth, and recommended that we use raw bones from the butcher instead. Nylabones are the only chew toys my dogs have used, so there is nothing else that could have cracked my dog's teeth. Please be cautious, and talk to your vet about whether nylabones are a safe choice for your dog."
2,not interested,My dog is not interested in this bone at all. He doesn't chew on it and will only play with it if I throw it in the yard as a fetching stick.
1,No so good...,I have a five month old Puggle. I decided to buy this for her because she's a very aggressive chewer. It seemed durable and long lasting. Nope. Not so much. I gave it to her and she had half of it chewed with in 20 minutes. I do not recommend this chew bone for dogs who are very aggressive chewers. It breaks down too quickly. :(
4,great chew toy for my dogs,my dogs love these bones. they are long lasting and very durable for rough chewers.
5,excellent but expensive,"The Nylabone durable chew is great for power chewers like my dog, she can really go at it in safety with this product. The only problem is that I did not realize that I had to buy 25.00 in pet products to get free shipping (I ordered dvds and cds) so I ended up paying double for the bone and could have purchased it at a regular store for less. It would be nice if there could be some sort of warning or hint that this rule exsists, I would have purchased more. Live and learn."
1,Boxer and Lab didn't see the point,"I have a one year old Boxer and a nine year old chocolate lab. Neither one was impressed with this nylabone. Supposed to be bacon flavored but I couldn't smell anything resembling bacon. (I would have tried it to be sure, but I figured that was too much to ask of me just so you could have an accurate review!)"
5,Awesome price.,I have an American bulldog/pit bull cross I adopted and she loves this nylabone. I have bought bones for her of all sizes and nothing beats this price. There are puppy nylabones at pet stores that cost more than what I spent on this. My dog chewed on it for almost 30 minutes after I presented the bone to her and it's shape is still intact. This will last a long time for sure.
1,How can they continue to sell these things?,"After the dog chews on an end, it makes indentations that turn into small sharp edges that start cutting the gums. If you see the color red, it's not inside the product. It's your dog bleeding. I tried a couple of brands so it's not the manufacturer it's the nylon. Where's PETA when you need them?"
5,Love it,"Our three Dobermans and Bulldog love this. However, it is not the same on in the pic. The one I received had raised bumps and grooves, which I think they enjoyed on their gums/mouth even better. I highly recommend this product."
2,Broke my dog's tooth; will not buy again,"My adult German Shepherd destroys things quickly as all GSD like to do. My vet recommended the Nylabone as it was supposed to be good for her teeth, so I got one, but it ended up chipping off about half of one of her little front teeth. In addition, once some chewing has occurred, the bone gets a lot of hard, sharp jagged edges that can cut both the dog's gums and my hands.It is definitely durable and my dog loved to chew on it, but I'd rather spend more money and have her go through a bunch of softer chew toys than to find more broken teeth. Also worth noting is that a different reviewer also mentioned a broken tooth."
3,HUGE,"The bone is fine in terms of quality, but I wasn't aware how big a bone this was! Buy this product for a big adult dog, way too large for a corgi's mouth! Apart from it being big, my dog just isn't interested in it."
1,BEWARE- Cracked Teeth!!!,"My Greater Swiss Mountain dog cracked two molars on nylabones. Both had to be surgically removed at a cost of about $1,000. I did not realize that the nylabone was the culprit with the first tooth, but witnessed and heard the crack the second time. I purposely always looked for a ""safe"" chew toy for my dog, and now my dog has 2 missing molars because of nylabone. Do not buy!"
4,This saves our sheets,"It says don't give it to dogs that have permanent teeth. My Schipperke has not suffered any dental damage, and loves chewing on it instead of sheets or pillowcases, shoes etc. Loves the chicken flavor, and it lasts a few months. I can say it's a good substitute for houshold goods."
2,Like rocks,"I bought two bones for my small dogs(yorkie and bichon). I believe they enjoyed them at first, but later in the day they had stopped playing with them and at dinner time I noticed they were not eating as much as they normally would. I have to guess that these toys might be to hard for my small dogs. A few days later my brother brought over his beagle and she loved them. The chicken flavor is noticeable when you take them out of the package. I would recommend these bones for medium to large breed dog."
1,Wrong 'flavor' delivered twice.,If I ever get what I've ordered I know my dog will love it. Unfortunately that's not happened yet.This is billed as a 'liver' flavor nylabone but twice now I've received the original flavor. Think twice about ordering from this company that cannot be bothered to pay enough attention to detail to give you what you've paid for.They also will not refund your money but only replace the item. I will continue to send it back until they actually send me the item I paid for. I wonder how long that will take.
1,Not the reaction I was going for.,"I bought this for our big time chewer/border collie but she wanted nothing to do with it. I think it's the hard plastic-y look and feel of it that she's not crazy about. She'd much rather have some rawhide, pigs ears and more natural chew toys....or my flip flops inadvertantly left on the back porch."
4,Lasts longer than most,"Great product overall. Our very strong-mouthed dog, destroys every toy we've bought for him...with the exception of 3: Galileo (by Nylabone), Nylabone Durachew, and Kong products. Very happy to keep purchasing Nylabone. Slightly dissatisfied with the new shape. Beware, even if picture doesn't look like the ""new style"" online, it will ship as such. it's textured for more interactive chewing, but our dog doesn't care about anything but the two ends."
5,The dogs love it,"Our two dogs have about 100 toys, and this is, hands down, their favorite. It lasts a very long time, too, so, for the money, it is an excellent choice."
2,My dogs turned up their (wet) noses,"I've tried the original Nylabone before and my dogs weren't interested in them. I got these hoping that the flavors would help entice them, but to no avail. Guess it's back to brushing their teeth!"
4,My dog loves it.,"My Laekenois loves this bone. I'm a bit afraid he might damage his teeth, so I don't let him chew on it for extended periods of time."
5,The Dogs rate this one NUMBER ONE,"It's not me you want to consult with about this product, but since my dogs can't type, I will pass on their opinion, which is that Nylabone makes the BEST chew bones of anyone! The material that they are made from is quite durable, although eventually it will be reduced in size. The only problem we have ever had with Nylabone chew toys is with the larger Galilieo bones, The dogs chew the ends down to a point, and a few of our dogs have cracked a tooth on the toy when its gets worn down this way. We have learned to cut off the sharpened edges, which leaves a blunt end."
5,My dogs love this bone,The price is right for this product. Both of my dogs absolutely love this bone. I like it because they cannot chew off pieces of it. They do grind it down but seem to really love doing that. I would definitely recommend this product through Amazon. Price is outrageous in the pet stores.
3,apparently not that tasty,"I bought this for my dog, and I thought he would love it since he loves the chicken flavor nylabones. However, he chewed it for a little bit, but then went back to his other one. Even when his old bone had to be thrown out (since it was so worn), he didn't really want this one. I would try it though, as other dogs have different tastes."
4,Good dog chew,Have had this bone for about a month now. My dog loves to chew on everything. She worked this bone over good the first few days. Now she uses it about 10 mins a day. The bone is probably worn down to about 80% its orginal size.
2,Disappointing,"The dog really isn't interested. However, I will say it is durable and the few times he has chewed it, there has been little wear."
3,Durable - but dog is not interested....,"My German Shepherd is not really interested in this bone. He likes many natural bones but really is not interested in this one - so it was not really useful to me. However, if your dog goes for this bone it will probably provide hours of pleasure. Recommended with reservations."
2,Your dog will either love it or hate it,"I've never had a dog that has been interested in one of these bones. I've had a siberian husky and a mutt in the past and neither one would chomp on one of these nylabones. I have tried the different flavors and textures, but neither one was interested. Years have past and we recently got a new siberian husky since we missed our old one. While he was teething I bought this for him hoping it may work, it didn't. I tried everything to cajole into liking this bone; however, nothing would make him like this thing. My mom told me that her golden retreiver enjoys these, so perhaps it's just a breed thing. It's worth a shot to see if your dog would like this, but be warned that I have had no success."
4,So durable! But...,"This thing has lasted 2 months and still going strong! We have a 1yr old pittmix & loves to chew. He rips rawhide in a matter of seconds but after reading how dangerous rawhide is we were looking for other options. We bought this, he loves it! One thing - after 2 months he chewed this thing into sharp corners & points that if he comes to play with you with it is like a weapon! We all lift our legs on the couch to avoid scratches! However, he loves it, he spends time with it and it is super durable so we are all happy! :D"
2,No Flavor,"I got this because I thought my dog would like it better since it claimed to be bacon flavored. He really liked the original one, so I thought might as well try it. But there was not the slightest scent of bacon. My dog chewed it once or twice, and is not interested in it anymore. Not very happy."
5,Nylabone,"We've used nylabones for years. Our lab retrievers love them. They are cost effective lasting much longer than any other product. Only warning, don't step on them with your bare feet, it hurts!"
3,Bought for a friend,I bought this bone for a neighbor dog because it was just like the big Nylabones I buy for our dogs. They just pick them up to gnaw on them throughout the day. The bones may be left lying around because they don't leave a residue on the carpets.
3,For very small dogs and puppies only,"I purchased this product for my puppy when she was 8 weeks old. It was an appropriate size for her at that time (Boston terrier). It appears well made, but it was not enticing for my puppy. She would rather chew on a bully stick or pig ear than this bone."
3,Size?,"I didn't understand the sizing of ""wolf"" as being a medium bone. My dogs need large bones, but they love it anyway. It just won't last as long."
2,Not impressed,"I have 3 dogs ranging from puppy to 3 years, all different breeds and sizes- and all 3 sniffed this and then walked away. Waste of my money :("
3,Fast delivery!,"I was surprised by the fast delivery! It was estimated that it would take about a week but it came within three days.I'm pretty satisfied with the product for now but that's because I just received it. The only problem I find is that my dog thinks its a real bone so he's trying to find a place to hide it. He doesn't get that it's a toy and he should be chewing and playing with it.He has tried chewing it a bit and has only made some dents into it. Oh, by the way, my dog is an American Staff. so he has some powerful teeth. I'm hoping this will last for awhile.UPDATE:It has been about a month since I received this item and my dog has barely touched it. Whenever I show it to him he just ignores it or takes it and hides it somewhere (like under his bed). I'm not sure why since he loves bones but maybe he thinks it's not a toy and he should not chew on it? Or he might just not like it. I'm still surprised that he has barely touched it because he loves to chew!"
4,Souper souper,"The only problem I have with this bone is it's too durable. The pup like to break it down. The puppy bone was too easiely broken down, would mix the purchase."
3,tough but not for my dog,it's good for normal dogs like a sheperd or rottie but my 5 month old red nose pit bull killed it in 6 days all that was left was about 3 inches and he poopped plastic for a week
4,Thought it was supposed to be textured?,"I ordered this thinking it was textured like the picture here shows. Well, it wasn't, and I found that kind of disappointing because I have a teething American Pitbull Terrier Pup who would have probaby liked the textured part. So, what I basically got was a normal Nylabone. Oh well. This is still great for the Dogs and their chewing needs."
1,Dental risk,"I just spent $1,400 on dental work for my two dogs, both of whom broke multiple teeth on these bones. The Bones do prevent tartar build-up but at an unacceptable cost. I believe this product should carry safety warnings because the vet told us that this is a common problem with the hard bones."
2,Dogs loved it... but made them sick! What's the point???,"When it says don't leave dogs unattended with this bone they mean it. It also says don't allow them to ingest pieces larger then rice or something like that... they mean that too. My 18 month old Pit was loving this bone and I tried to take every piece that she chewed off away from her as it came off. A few pieces must have got past me and in her tummy and on the floor, because she started having violent vomiting a day latter, then our 8 year old pit started doing the same. We were for sure that we had got some Chinese chicken strips or something then we started going through the vomit (sick what we do for our kids) and found Nylabone chunks in both dogs vomit. Haven't had a issue since. My husband has banned any product from this company from entering our house again.Buyer beware and watch your dogs."
4,"Nice and Durable, But Be Aware of The Size Guide","I feel confident that my puppy won't destroy this bone anytime soon but do beware of the size. ""Petite"" is just that. This variety is for dogs up to 15lbs (not mentioned in the product description) and is VERY small."
4,One dog loved it; One dog could care less,"One dog loved it, and the other dog sniffed it and ran away. So now, one of my dogs has two nylabone dura chews, which she clearly loves. She likes to chew on them both, as if they are different. Either way, it keeps this energetic and anxious dog busy when I am trying to get things done."
1,Huge disappointment,"Very disappointed in this product. It's basically just a piece of plastic. Our dog tried to chew on it once, but had no interest in it after that. He didn't even seem to notice or care about the bacon flavor. Granted, he is a greyhound and they can be pretty picky, but he is more of a chewer than most other greyhounds. Overall, very dissatisfied - will never purchase again."
5,Wonderful for busy chewers!,"I love the souper size nylabones! they are sturdy and last with my heavy chewers. Granted, they can chew them down to nothing, BUT, it takes a few months! I have 4 dogs and I buy 4 souper nylabones every 4 months or so. They also get regular raw beef bones, but they actually prefer the nylabones once all the meat/marrow is off the regular bones."
4,Talent In the Air,These are really good songs. I really believe that most of them are really beautiful along with the lyrics. Good effort put into this sophomore record.
5,The Best CD I Own - Simply The Best,"What an album!!! I went to a concert to see Alabama last summer and her voice just blew me away. I ran out to get a copy of ""Something in the Air"" and I was not dissipointed. I can't pick a favorite, but here are the best ones: ""With You, I Will Be, Crush, Hit By Love, and Can You Hear Me"" If you don't have this CD it is awesome. I am a HUGE fan of Lila McCann!!!!!!"
5,LILA ROCKS!,"I am not really a fan of country music (B*witched, Five and *N Sync are my style) but Lila is great! ""With You"" is a great song. I recently saw the music video and it was funny!"
5,Awesome!,"I think that this a really great second album for Lila. She has really proved that she can shine. I think that she sounds so much clearer and older on this album, than she did on her first. I am really glad that I bought her CD. I would recommend this to anyone who likes country. Hey I even think she's better than LeAnn Rimes."
5,I think that this cd is the best I have heard all day!,"Lila McCann is a terrific artist. I am really pleased with her album. The song with you is, what I think, the best song on the whole album! I hope that she comes out w/many more."
4,"My favorite song is ""With You."" GOOD!!!!!!!",Just received the CD today as a gift! I have enjoyed it very much! Good choice for a gift!
2,China To The Minimum is more like it,"This is a very disappointing DVD. It is short, and not only does it only include the 2 cities, but the coverage of those is very brief. The narration is all right but just didn't inspire me as much as others such as Rick Steves accomplish. At the end of the video my reaction was ""that's it?"". Very unsatisfying. And where is Beijing? How can a trip to China called ""China to the MAX"" not include the place of the Forbidden City, among other reasons. And if you want the Great Wall, forget about it. Yes, I know the ""max"" is a play on words - but you really realize how lame it is after you watch this video and realize what a minimal tour of China you just got. I'm not a huge fan of Samantha Brown, a little too ""perky"" and stereotypical American for my tastes, however, her China episodes left me feeling a lot more satisfied than this video. Take a pass on this."
3,"eh, take it or leave it","I liked the episodes, but there were 2, and they were half and hour long! Rudy shows you several nice places to visit, but if theres only 2 episodes, so you'd think they would be much longer, and more informative! This was kinda backround noise for me, if there was something interesting, id look up, but mostly it wasnt too informative. Samantha covered Hong kong, and it was 45 minutes, and showed more than this, so I would go with her Aisan set, plus it has other countries like Malaysia, Japan, Thailand, ect."
2,Disappointing muddle,"Being a huge fan of the Gyllenhaal/Hershey collaboration ""A Killing in a Small Town"" (aka ""Evidence of Love""), I had very high expectations for this, especially with Debra Winger in the cast. Alas, 'twas not to be. This is a meandering slog of a movie, with an ending that'll make you throw up your hands in exasperation for wasting two hours of your life. Winger's performance could not be bettered; curiously, Hershey (who deservedly won an Emmy for ""Killing in a Small Town"") has very little to do. Take a pass unless you're a huge fan of the stars."
3,"Yowza! Gabriel Byrne plus Hershey, Winger, Straithairn!","Despite the slightly Lifetime-for-Women feeling of 'A Dangerous Woman' this is pretty good. The cast is a director's dream, only this director must have cried every night wishing he had a bigger project! I love Barbara Hershey and Debra Winger, they should be in other stuff together. Gabriel Byrne is such a doll, and you get to see David Straithairn in nothing but briefs! Watch for Chloe Webb from China Beach in a minor part. Once the somewhat outlandish ending has played out, you won't mind because of the fun scenes where Byrne gets to emote and then there are the racier scenes but if you think I'm going to tell you what they are you're wrong, you will just have to watch it!"
3,Ashra - 'Bell Alliance' (Blue Plate),"Originally released in 1980, I had no idea that Ashra had this many CD titles out and available. 'Belle Alliance' is more in the progressive vein than their other discs. This particular effort didn't blow my mind, nor did it put me asleep. Tunes I dug the most were the ska-like guitar driven ""Boomerang"", ""Sausalito"" and the fifteen-minute inventive ""Code Blue"". Believe this same piece was later put out as an expanding 2-CD reissue."
2,Berkley quick set rod holder,"I was kayak fishing on my friend's boat a month ago. This all happened in on day and is the truth! When reaching for his rod, he fell over in his kayak. I pulled him out of the Long Island Sound. The telescopic rod that I brought him as a gift from Europe (and sell on Ebay) and his 35 yr. old Mitchell #302 Classic reel are at the bottom of the Long Island Sound. We still went out after he changed his clothes. I later hooked a fish and the rod was pulled backwards as I was trolling in the Kayak. The plastic mount broke, but my rod managed to stay in the left over slot. I am replacing what I used and broke for my friend. I suggested putting a sleeve around the base to reinforce it in the future. If you do purchase this item, set your drag very low and readjust after hooking a fish; not the best technique but better than losing your equipment."
4,I love it as much as my kids do,"From the moment we started reading this book, my kids and I were laughing about all the things moms can't do. It's funny and nicely illustrated, but best of all it puts a cute spin on how we involve our kids in our daily activities. If you like this one, you'll also like OLIVIA, about an energetic pig who wears herself and her mother out."
4,I Never Knew Mom's Coudn't Do So Much!,Recently picked up this book for my niece and found that I enjoyed it more than she probably did. I think the humor is very sweet and incredibly enjoyable. It's a wonderful take on what moms can't do from the little one's perspective.The illustrations really add to the fun of the story and remind me of books I was read as a child.I highly recommend this fun story for your child and even more so for yourself.
1,Don't Buy This Unit...It WILL Fail,"I've experienced the same problem as the person above. This piece of junk will periodically freeze with the display showing 16 degree F. When it freezes, you'll have busted soda, beer and wine all over the place. It's been repaired under warranty 3 times. Each time they replace the control panel and circuit board. It just froze again and it looks like I'll finally get my money back. You would think that a Canadian based company would produce a better product. We've had refrigeration for what....almost a 100 years. You'd think Danby could figure out how to do this. I've also had one of their wine coolers fail.DON""T BUY DANBY....it's NOTHING BUT JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Freezing Problem,I own this refrigerator and about one year into using it it is periodically freezing my drinks. I have to shut it off then it is ok for a while. The thermostat says it gets as low as 16 degrees!Trying to find out a solution to it now...
3,More than OK,Often felt like I was reading Kafka. Other times it felt like plodding. Hard work sometimes but probably worth it.
4,DEFINITELY indulgent...,"This is a beautiful recording, you can tell he's trying to walk you through the music and make you love it as much as he does. This may be my new favorite recording of this work, and it also may not be (Anderszewski? Ricther? Libetta?) -- I can't make up my mind, but it'd definitely got my blood boiling, but isn't that what music's all about?"
5,Nice even cut every time,As state in the title. The cut is nice and even every time. Fell a couple of times but still cuts even. I store mine in clipper oil to avoid rust or such. Does what it is meant to.
4,Very good history of ballooning through the ages,"I liked this book very much because of the many detailed accounts of early adventurers. Good photos of early flights. Interesting drawings, and black-and-white photos. Includes some rare lost photos from 1800's. Gives overall early history of ballooning, very informative for the ballooning fan"
4,from the library,My son and I enjoyed this library find. Hoping to purchase the hardcover. The stories are short and to the point that my five year old did not lose interest. I enjoyed the illustrations and stories myself.
4,"A Different sounding Album, But Not Bad","Just got the cd. Yes, there's a heavy west coast influence on the cd but it's all good. I got a chance to see the guy at a show and he's still got it made. A real down to earth guy too. Buy it to support a hiphop legend. I'm gonna get on my hovercraft now and zoom off....."
3,Does Special Ed still got it made?,"Nine years later, Special Ed drop out his fourth album. I first heard about this album on undergroundhiphop. When I played the samples, his voice has gotten deeper. He also had a role in the movie ""Ganked"" starting ""Kel Mitchell"". So Special Ed had becoming an mature man and got his own label. My favorite songs are ""Smile and So Long, Goodbye."" He also features Snoop Dogg in the song ""We Gon Ride."" Youngest in Charge was his best album. Legal was his second best album. And Revelations was his third best album. Well that's all I want to say about the album."
3,Utility cart,"I'm 6'2"" tall. This cart is too short for me. It's narrow and easy to turn over. Strong, but only one set of wheels turn."
5,Great Cart,I was quite happy with my recent purchase for my company. The cart is made out of very durable material. The wheel are very quiet and rolls very smoothly. Shipping was very good.
5,Sturdy Easy to Assemble,I originally purchased a $40 metal cart from Menards. Flimsy construction and poor structural integrity forced me to return it. This Northern Industrial is solid and easy to assemble. Nice big non-stick castors make it ideal if you don't want to be marking up nice floors.
3,OK but wheels are not the best,"Does what it's supposed to do but if you plan on moving this around outside this won't last. I carry tools and parts from my work van to the customer site inside and the wheels are almost shot, the hard plastic coating around them came apart after about 3 weeks and now the wheels are almost ground down to nothing. I will need to replace the wheels with heavy duty in the next month or so. I hope I can find something that will fit...buyer beware if this needs to go ""OFF ROAD""."
4,"Joe, siempre grande!","Joe Arroyo is one of the greatest, yet unknown, tropical musicians of all times. His unique style, joeson, is a very interesting mixture of caribbean, african and latin rhythms, all in one. Great for dancing, listening or hanging out!!! This particular selection has his older hits, early 80's - early 90's. I'm not sure if it's available on Amazon, but if possible, get your hands on 32 Grandes Exitos (5 stars!!!)Top 5 on this version1. Rebelion [Joeson]GREAT!!! Rebelion is an all time classic.2. Te Quiero Mas [Joeson]Carnaval de Barranquilla classic... will transport you to these magical nights3. Teresa Vuelve [Joeson]Great for dancing!!4. Pa'L BailadorGreat oldie, very nice rhythm5. Por ti no moriré"
5,Very inspirational,"I have spent several years reading the Bible daily and various ""thoughts of the day"" pamphlets that you get through church. At least where I am in my spiritual development (at this time, looking inward for God vs. externally and learning about other philosophies such as Buddism to see what insights I can gain), I find this to be very rewarding and inspirational. I particularly like that Tolstoy used Christianity as the basis but also looked to other philosophies, which he includes.I bought this book as an afterthought when I purchased Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God is Within Us. I'm so glad that I bought it because it's easy to pick up and read each day, and I'm getting a lot out of it. The Kingdom book is more intensive read in terms of actual reading so other books have caught my interest first. This book is one of them."
4,DVD better,"Bente King has a wonderfully clear style of writing. Although I don't read books on art (I find the technical details overwhelming), I read her book. She writes like she talks, I think.However, I feel that if you are a total beginner, the DVD would be more helpful in illustrating her technique. The book is useful for taking the guesswork out of what colours to use on the flower."
5,Fun kids book,"I bought this for my daughter after having purchased all the other Steven Kellogg American folk tales. This book is as good as all the rest, amazing illustration and fun stories. This is particularly unique since it has a female heroine."
3,Not the book I expected,"This book was linked to a book of the same title, but a different author/illustrator - Steven Kellogg. NOT the same and not what I wanted or thought I was buying. It's an ok book - in good shape and will work as a comparison, but I needed the Kellogg book for my lesson plans. Given the price I paid for it, I won't complain too much, but I do feel a bit deceived - kinda ""bait and switch""."
3,Responding to the Critics,"Theonomy is the idea that most of God's Old Testament laws still apply today. Either wemake ourselves the highest standard of right and wrong, and then grope around in the dark trying to figure out the difference between the two, or we submit our thinking to God's revealed standard for holiness - the law. Theonomists typically point to the abiding relevance of the moral laws, because morality does not change, anymore than God's holy character can change, therefore the laws expressing that morality cannot change either. More controversial is their insistence that the penalties of the law should also be upheld. This book consists of a series of articles meant to answer another book written by the faculty of a Reformed seminary (Westminster) who were critical of theonomy. Its a very thought-provoking read. I think the Theonomists have made a much better case than their critics."
3,Peterson's Little Psalms Book and Little Proverbs Book,"These two little books independent of the ""Message"" are easy to carry and referrence during hospital visits, or any visit. I have them by my bedside for quick reference when doing devotional prayer. Lovelly gift giving."
4,inspiring,"I heard this mix for the first time last night and was carried along on its trancey, drum&bass journey. There's energy and beauty in this album that DJ Dazee has created, and I wrote and danced throughout while it played. I hadn't discovered an inspiring drum & bass mix in a while, this one was worth it."
5,It really works!,"This sunshade really works, keeping the interior temperature lower. It also protects the car dash from direct sunlight damage. The size is ideal to cover the entire windshield. Looks good and it is easy and fast to roll. I really recommend this product to any car owner."
2,I felt bad laughing...,"This book was funny, yet somehow cruel. I feel bad for the people who know this person and have made their way into Ms. St. James' book. She steroetypes many kinds of people that we all know exist, but somehow it seems harsh in print. She also seems a bit full of herself. There were parts of the book that really made me laugh, but most of it I just thought, I hope she isn't describing anyone at her current gigs because she's probably going to lose some business. This part auto-biographical doesn't do it for me. She didn't tell me anything I didn't already know about how to win contests, etc."
5,Prima: Good guides.,"It's just like a strategy guide should be... It's made by Prima, the company that makes most, if not all strategy guides... There's a reason for that."
3,Confusing...,"It's concise, I'll give it that. But it's disorganized and confusing to use. The sidequest section is invaluable if you want to experience everything in the game"
3,Might be worth it if you plan on wearing this game out,Only if you plan on playing this game through more than once in a month should you buy this book.
4,Great Album... new songs for '99,"This is their new album. I'm into Euro dance since '91, and this album is not a hit. This is completely different then the other ones. New style. no rap. M.T. has returned, but their new songs will never be on top. They will never beat the top-hits like You're my heart you're my soul, brother louie, cheri cheri lady and many others."
5,A Remarkable Book with an Unforgettable Voice,"This novel covers a year in the life of a Hispanic teenager living in a Florida barrio in the late sixties. The voice of Sammy, the main character, is authentic and his personality is vivid and lovable. I was rooting for him from page one through the end.The author also captures the flavor of the barrio and Sammy's high school through wonderful portrayals of Sammy's girlfriend Juliana, his Hispanic and Jewish friends, his caring family, and his next door neighbor. They practically step off the page.Finally, the book, through portrayals of Vietnam soldiers, school protests, and diminishing hemlines, makes the late sixties come alive.Sammy and Juliana is a wonderful novel."
4,Needed for Amaryllis Plants,I needed six to hold up three Amaryllis plants. They are sturdy and really do the job. First experience with these plants at Christmas.
3,Blossom Stakes,It is made of pretty thin material and the weight of the amaryllis plant does make it bend as well. I was waiting for heavier duty stakes from the bulb company which are far superior to these. I have six stakes holding these plants up.
5,if i could give six i would!,this is the bosstones greatest cd ever! it was the first one i ever heard and to this day remains the best...i enjoy their other stuff and own almost every album but this remains my personal fav...not just by them but my favorite ska album!highly reccomend this to anyone!
5,Devil rocks,"This album is great. Bosstones really know how to play good music. most of the songs are really good, do somethin crazy is the best! I also really like the beginning of 'Hope I Never Lose My Wallet'get this one, you'll love it"
5,amazing,"I hunted for this album for a long time and i was pleased when my efforts were rewarded with an excellent album. Having only heard the live version of the song Devil's night out, i didn't know what to expect of the studio track, because the live one made very little sense. It blew me away. Other excellent tracks are patricia and the cave. Those two tracks are perfectly ordered. The mellow, sad tones of patricia turn into the uplifting beat of the cave.It's a shame that this band has cycled so many good members. The ones that remain, the Pay attention brethren, are not bad, but are still the weakest ensemble of players the band has seen..."
1,"""Murder, She Droned""","For anybody that is expecting production values similar to those of the best TV mysteries of the nineties and later (like the Marple series with Geraldine McEwan or David Suchet's Poirot) this production will be a big disappointment. Angela Lansbury makes a really awful Marple and the addition of various ""big name"" stars like Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson ruin the mood even further since the director is apparently forced to linger and linger on meaningless scenes that give the ""stars"" extra screen time.The sets look like somebody decided to save money by putting in the minimum effort to make them look like they came from 1953. You could barely tell the difference between the interiors from this film and what you would expect to see on Magnum P.I.Although this is probably one of the less exciting Miss Marple stories the terrible production values, awful casting, and absurd cliches ruin whatever chances this had of being watchable."
3,"Really, Do not waste your money on this DVD box !","It is only a waste of money, i tell you Because:one of the movies is with miss Marple and not very wellthis is my ratings:DEATH ON THE NILE: 4,5/5 Pointshorror: 3/5intellegence: 4/5humour: 2/5EVIL UNDER SUN: 4/5 Pointshorror: 1/5intelligence: 4/5humour: 4/5THE MIRROR CRACKED: 0 POINTShorror: 1/5intelligence: 1/5humour: 4/5my advice to you is NOT to follow the series of miss Marplebut enjoy the two other films with Hercule Poirot."
2,A disappointed Agatha Christie fan.,"The original murder mystery by Agatha Christie was a very clever whodunnit. This film really loses all of the flavor of Christie's work, and turns the characters and plot into a campy cartoon of caricatures -- even Miss Marple isn't as sharp as she should have been. A lot of scenes are wasted and filled with pointless dialogue that really detracts from the story. I don't believe anyone watching this film could figure out the murderer from the 'clues' given. The director really missed the boat on this one. A far superior version of this appeared on British television."
3,O.K. Agatha Christie,"An American movie production invades a small English town, and if that weren't enough to cause a disruption, murder comes with it. Once again, Miss Marple comes to the rescue, with her incredible knack for detail and deduction, as well as her understanding of human nature. Miss Marple is played by Angela Lansbury, who doesn't quite capture the famous character, but is entertaining in the role nonetheless. Rock Hudson is the director, Tony Curtis the producer, while Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak are the stars of the American production. Their performances are alright, with Novak seeming to have a lot of fun, but nothing special. Actually, that's part of the problem with the film - it's competently done, but nothing more. There's some good dialogue between Taylor and Novak, but on the whole, the film lacks energy. It could have been a lot better, although it is certainly watchable."
2,read the book instead,for Agatha Christie fans only. The only good thing about this film is that the acting is adequate. Although a faitful adaptation of the book it should've been even more so.
1,TERRIBLE! I HATE THIS MOVIE!!,"We bought this movie thinking it was going to be somewhat like ""and then there were none"". HAH! This movie was wierd and sooooo boring, and drawn-out, how can you other reviewers say it was good?! It STUNK!"
3,add subtitles to dvd,Enjoyed seeing all these older celebs hamming it up..I don't think we have any real stars anymore...Those days are long gone.One big disappointment I had with this DVD is that there are no subtitles. Am visiting my mom for the holidays and she is hard of hearing..I know she would have enjoyed the film if there were subtitles.
4,"four stars for the cast,1 star for the mystery","with it's cast of old pros(elizabeth taylor,rock hudson,kim novak,tony curtis,and angela lansbury as miss marple this film is very watchable,but the mystery really is why any of them would want to be in this one with such a weak script.10mins in you'll spot who the killer is and without the mystery going for it the only reason this movie works is because of the talent in front of the camera!in the 50's a film crew comes to miss marple's village to shot a come back movie for ms.taylor(which was just what this movie was for her after a long time off the screen)only to have murder creep into the cast and crew.ms. taylor and ms. novak are great fun as to actors who would rather catfight than work together,and mr. hudson and mr.curtis are just fine as the men in both their lives. but as alwasy ms. landsbury is the center of it all as one of the best miss marple's of them all.watch this one for the pros and not the very silly mystery taged to it!!!!!"
3,Agatha Christie's he Mirror Cracked,"This story is not one of Christie's best in my opinion, where Miss Marple becomes involved in the glamourous world of films. All star cast but not an all star script. Lansbury is fine as Miss Marple, but rather different from Joan Higdon who has made the character her own. A must for Christie fans, but not one of the best."
3,"Handy and Convenient Tool - Not Bad, Not Great","The ""Swiss Tech UKTBS Utili-Key 6-in-1"" attaches easily to your key ring and is completely unobtrusive, being the same shape and size of a normal key. The multi-tool can be a little hard to open at first, but becomes easier with usage.While it says 6-in-1 (Flat Screwdriver, Micro Eyeglass Screwdriver, Bottle Opener, Phillips Screwdriver, and Knife), I find that the Phillips Screwdriver and Knife are the most practical and get the most use.The tool is reasonably well made and sturdy, but should not be used as a pry bar or other high stress uses.A handy and convenient tool, recommended if like having basic tools with you at all times."
3,difficult to use if you have RA,What is ironic is that if you have limited hand strength you are probably the person most likely to *NEED* a tool like this as a helping hand but unfortunately because of the design you'd be the *least* likely person to get any use out of it.I bought his tool hoping it would help me with things like opening difficult packaging when on the go but I didn't realize that the design presents a problem if you have If you have limited dexterity in your hands/fingers. You may want to consider how the MultiTool opens; you need to be able to have significant pinch grip dexterity to grasp the knife and pull the blade apart to fully access the tools and also to remove it from the key ring. Unfortunately I cannot open the tool at all; my pinch grip is not sufficient enough to do this.Just a word of caution for those with limited/different abilities.
5,sneaky little thing,excellent little backup knife for the money. fits nicely on a keychain so you can always have it with you. great buy
2,Not a great model,"I actually bought this model by mistake, not realizing that it didn't include the bottle opener, which is the primary reason I like this multi-tool so much. Having a nail file instead of an opener seems pretty pointless. That being said, it's still pretty handy. One downside is that it's easy to forget you have it on your keyring when you are traveling - I have accidentally taken mine on planes several times, but I've also had one confiscated by TSA when they noticed it."
2,If there is nothing else...,"Pros: Fits on the keychain so it is always with youCons: Even though it is called ""Swiss"" it is made in China (or India) out of recycled tin cans. I would gladly pay twice as much for a quality tool - knife that holds the edge, screwdriver that doesn't turn into useless roundshaped stick - you get my drift.Conclusion: The idea is great, but the implementation is horrible."
4,"""Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors"" (""Korolevstvo Krivykh Zerkal"")","It's a very nice fairy-tale, mostly interesting for children, but it can be interesting for the adults as well. Has a good teaching point in it, that the evil will never succeed, and that the truth always wins!! Very good quality DVD, I enjoyed watching it with my family!I used to watch it on TV when I was a child myself, and watching it now again, brought back the memories.Would recommend also watching ""The Tale of the Time Lost"" - it teaches the kids to value time instead of wasting it, and be organized. :-)"
4,Wash & wear shirt,"If you're looking for a nice looking wash and wear shirt, then this is it. If you're busty, then buy a size larger."
4,Good handbook,"Nice collection of articles on clinical engineering. Many articles on CE in countries outside of North America, which were interesting, but not always applicable."
3,Clinical Enginnering,"Actually, I was expecting theorytical and literal information, but instead, I found more informations in article form about site experiences.This may be more helpfull for some people.Thanks,Nazif Ilker Sezdi"
5,Very Helpful.,"I found this guide very helpful in playing FABLE. Using it I was able to find all the silver keys, open all the demon doors, and find just the right tatoo to give my character. I did find one major flaw with the book, however. Even though it explains where each of the Treasure Clues are, it doesn't actually tell you the exact place where the buried lost treasure is. But, other than that, it's a very useful guide."
3,It's ok,The game is pretty simple but i expected more info from a guide. i still had to look some thing up online. I want to get everything on the first run through. thats why i buy a guide.
3,Fable Official Strategy Guide,"Helpful guide, but would have been better if there were more concise references to where chests were at and the number of keys needed to open them."
2,Fable Guide,"I got the guide because it was 50% off with the game purchase, and the mean chick behind the counter used scare tatics, threatening ""hard to find hidden items"". I finished the game without using the guide and then replayed it using the guide. There was very little I missed as the game itself is short if you're just playing straight through without collecting the extra items and quests. Therefore, I gave it the 2 star rating. It's a decent guide, but in all honesty, very unnecessary."
4,Birds seem to like it a lot,"Seems to be a well loved feed. But I can find four times the quantity at half the price at a local store not all that far from the house. At a going rate of 5Lbs a week,I need to go with Quantity."
2,Overpriced.,"Let me first start out by saying I love this bird feed, and so do the birds!But this particular size is overpriced. You can get a much bigger bag at places like Target.Save your $$$"
4,Bird Food,I decided to put up a bird feeder since we have alot of Sparrows on the block. The birds love the food and I love watching them try and take turns eating it.
5,Great spacesaving switch,"We just remodeled our 5 x 8 bathroom and this switch allowed us to minimize the size of the electrical gang on the wall. We only need the one switch ( to work the sink light, the exhaust fan and the light over the tub) and one plug outlet. We also purchased the plug outlet with the built in nightlight - which saves us using one of the plugs for a nightlight - as our interior bathroom has now windows. We only needed 2 gangs for all our electrical needs."
4,Attractive Timepiece,Stylish but not ostentatious. Complements business or casual attire. A nice addition to my collection.
5,A much-needed analysis of the philosophy and strategy of JKD,"At long last, someone has written a book that focuses on the structure and philosophy of JKD. There are already many good technique-oriented books on the market (such as those by Burton Richardson, Chris Kent, and Larry Hartsell), and Sifu Korol does not try to retread this ground. Instead he offers an in-depth, critical analysis of the fundamental principles of scientific self-defense. This is a book that should be taken seriously by any student of the martial arts who aims to train realistically. As an instructor of Jeet Kune Do and jujitsu, I can heartily recommend this work."
5,THE SHADOW STRIKES,"It looks as if Marengo Films rescued these two old movies from obscurity. I was thrilled to see they were on DVD and was not disappointed. Grand National Pictures was bought by another film company after putting these two marvelous films out. That answers why there are no other films which followed. These movies are fun to watch and are similar to such greats as Mr.Wong, Charlie Chan, Dick Tracy and the Thin Man... Oh, how things have changed in acting and style... though Hollywood did honor the style I think with LA Confidential... Both films are A MUST FOR COLLECTORS and the DVD is truly a CLASSIC. Technically, the prints are pretty darn good and the sound is perfect."
2,RIP OFF,"These are okay detective movies, but it's really not The Shadow.Lamont Cranston has been turned into Lamont Granston and he's an ordinary joe who's a crime reporter. That's as exciting as it gets. There's nothing in these movies that has anything to do with The Shadow so you've been warned.You might want to save your money since these two ""Shadow"" movies aren't what they claim to be. The Shadow serial and the Alec Baldwin movie are the way to go for fans of The Shadow. The Invisible Avenger isn't as close to the mark as the serial and Baldwin film, but it's worth a look too."
5,The Shadow: Shadow Strikes/Int'l Crime DVD,"Bought it as a gift for Jill's Dad and he loves it. Sweet quality, good sound, and he actually was happier the next day after watching it. Very, very happy with the whole presentation of this product."
5,Best I've ever owned...,This is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever. I highly recommend it.
2,sized small,"I wish bra manufacturers would get together on what constitutes a certain size. I wear 42 DD in many bra brands, but in others it's too small. This one is WAY too small. Maybe bras that have little stretch should be have more gradations in size. Even if this bra fit, I don't think I'd like it. I don't like the way the two layers are only attatched at the edges; I think that would be uncomfortable and the extra snap seems superfluous. I've never had two or three bra hooks just suddenly give way, and I've never heard of it happening to anyone else."
2,appears a lot bigger than it really is.,"it fits like a childs watch. probably designed for a small or petite woman, but fror regular sized waoman it is to small.I've only worn it once."
5,As expected,"Great tool for gapping spark plugs. Great build quality, very accurate. Did not come with any users manual, but there are plenty of videos on youtube showing you how to get the most out of this item."
5,"A great tool for developing solid, effective email policies","I found this book very intuitive and easy to read. My company helps organizations put software controls in place to reduce their exposure to Internet and Email related threats. In many cases, my customers are asking for direction on how to set up solid, effective policies for email and internet usage. This book addresses that need perfectly. It splits down the issue into the key component parts, discusses the potantial threats using real life examples and recommends protective wording to put in your policy. As a policy maker, you can judge which are the most important threats to your business and create a policy related to your requirements. Importantly, the book provides insight as to how to monitor and manage the policy you have created on an on-going basis. Just creating it and distributing it is not enough anymore."
3,90s Schtick - some good moments,"These are clipped from A&E;'s Live at the Improv - total of 6 individual volumes, each with different talent, available also as a boxed set. Each concentrates on a 5-7 min. set comprising basically the most famous premises from each comic. Not necessarily a great or comprehensive collection, but nice as an intro. to each comic's particular style. Paula kvetches and headlines/MC, Martin Lawrence's ears before he had them pinned, personally pretty happy to see Dennis Leary included.Star: Martin Lawrence TV/Film Actor/ComedianStar: Denis Leary American Comedian/ActorStar: Bill Maher American ComedianStar: Paula Poundstone ComedianStar: Rick RockwellStar: Hugh Fink Standup ComedianStar: Jeff Marder Standup ComedianStar: Brian Hailey Standup Comedian"
1,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS,"This book did not even have a sample menu. I read about the diet in a magazine and it gave you more information on a daily food plan than the book. After glancing through this book, I returned it. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
2,Not what's advertised,"The battery that I received it's not like the one showed in the picture, I purchased this battery because I was expecting a Samsung battery and it was not, I received a generic one with scratches on the surface."
1,surreal trash,"this has got to be one of the WORST albums i have ever bought in my entire life...annoying...at times unbearable to listen to...the lead singer's voice is completely irritating...i thought i heard diferrent when i gave it a spin at best buy, but after bringing it home...i was saddened with the overall album...my friends have advised me to toss it, but I always keep albums around just in case."
3,"Trick Candles, not Sparkler Candles","I will keep this brief. I ordered these for new years because I thought they would continuously sparkle. They in fact are the ""trick"" candles that relight even after blowing out the flame. They do sparkle when they come back to light, but not quite a Sparkle candle effect I was hoping for."
2,Not what I expected,"On the packaging, these candles say ""Sparkler Trick Candles"" and they are neither. The don't sparkle at all, at best they may flicker once every 30 seconds or so, and only 1 out of the 6 candles on the cake actually turned back on after my kid blew them out. They are also very tall and very thin, so they break easily and some of them are curved a bit. They just made the cake look thrown together and cheap instead of making it dazzle."
3,Misleading Title,"I purchased Down and Dirty with Jim Norton thinking it was going to be stand-up with Jim Norton. This DVD is hosted by Jim Norton, but is 4 - 30 minute episodes of stand-up by other comedians. Each episode you see less than 5 minutes of Jim telling jokes, so I was pretty disappointed. If you are an avid collector of Jim Norton stuff, I would say buy this DVD. But if you are looking for some true stand-up of Jim Norton I would say buy his other DVD, ""Monster Rain"" instead."
1,Unredeemed evil and depravity,"I have read thousands of books and this is, by far, the most evil and depraved book I have ever read. Or heard about. True, I read the original, unrevised edition. It was about nothing but torture. Torture on every page. Especially the torture of animals. Cave could have given the Nazis at Dachau lessons. I'm sorry I finished it but I kept thinking there would be some resolution, some repudiation of the torture.There never was.I've hated Nick Cave ever since. The projects he chooses show he has not changed. A few years ago he was attracted to the ""Cat Piano"" animation, a cat piano being a musical instrument that gets its sound from the torture of cats.I don't know if this ""revised edition"" is any different. But I will never again expose myself to anything Nick Cave is associated with and I advise you to do the same. Someone so in love with animal torture surely has not just written about it but done it. I don't know why he isn't in jail."
1,Tries way to hard to be Blood Meridian....,"Now, i actually like Nick Cave, i thought the proposition was an amazing movie and his music is not terrible BUT this book is too much of a Faulknerian-esque rip off to enjoy, dragged on for 50 pages too long and the writing was just...contrived to say the least.It was almost like he got done reading Blood Meridian or As I Lay Dying and thought ""Hey maybe i can write a book!"".Do not trust everything you read on Amazon, you may love it. But please, if you have read any of the books mentioned by me previously, it will be very hard not to compare it and therefore be let down. He literally rips off those authors."
5,And Ah wish there were more to read during the rains...,"A fabulously dark tale of gore, murder, and sexual twists. An excellent read, but not for those who are light of stomach or with conservative values.Cave provides highly detailed and descriptive narratives of an idiot martyr's life and eventual descent into self destruction, carrying a fervent, cult-like town with him."
5,To those of you who didn't understand it...,"...read it again. This book is complicated. One of the hardest I've ever read. Most of it is written in sort of a southern accent mixed with gothic poetry. I don't think I've ever read anything like it. Parts are so disgusting you almost have to ""look away.""I was basically blown away by this book. The way he describes the scenery and the things that go through the main character, Euchrid's mind is amazing. Admittedly, I am a huge fan of The Bad Seeds. But I am also a fan of thousands of other music groups and I don't think you necessarily have to be a fan of Nick Cave's music to appreciate this book. However, I stress this again: it is very graphic."
5,FINALLY!,"Well, it took me long enough to find this book, but after much searching, I managed to get my greedy little hands on a British first edition which had never been read (if that's not a rarity, I don't know what is!). All I can say is Brilliant. This novel reads like a sprawling epic song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, very rooted in the theme of their 1985 classic, ""Tupelo"" which proclaims ""The firstborn is dead,"" ""a child is born at his brother's heels,"" ""a bottle and a box and a cradle of straw,"" etc. All of these elements and elements from Cave songs, released before and after ATASTA, show up here. Nick adapts his writing style to the medium of the novel with stunning ease and quickly sucks you into his twisted vision. I know that this book is extremely difficult to find, but if you can get hold of a copy, don't ever let go...it's priceless."
2,1 Giant Leap,"I became aware of this title through the local Cable Combine's on-demand function. But for Vonnegut's association, I could have easily neglected this significant treatise combining musical, philosophical, spiritual, etc., commentaries reflecting much of what is fundamentally important to our human collective. As such, the broadcast projects fabulous power, so I looked into the DVD. Featuring 155 minutes, I thought, ""Great! The DVD is twice as long as the teevee version."" So, I order the DVD but am distressed to learn that we can't simply run the entire program with one simple press of the play button but must instead manually start each chapter!! Annoying!!! That significantly detracts from an otherwise noteworthy sequence. So much for continuity. For that reason, the producers have earned 1 Giant Leap two stars."
2,"Mildly interesting, but mostly a disappointment","A great deal of hard work and technical and artistic expertise have gone into making this ingeniously-designed film, but IMHO it was mostly to no avail. While the film contains some beautiful imagery and some beautiful music, its philosophizing is truly lame, and I found several of the speakers who appear in the film to be enormously pretentious, stupid, and irritating. This is MTV-style pseudo-philosophy of the shallowest kind."
2,"yet another one, much better, exists","you all probably didn't see swedish 'lucky people center international'go find it and you will forget about this leap'lucky people..' is a real masterpiece of 'koyaanisqatsi' level, much much more clever, nice and driving"
5,got Spirit?,"This film is what I would call a spiritual adventure. Great music, great imagery from all over the world, great insightful interviews with people of all different faiths. It's the kind of film that keeps giving something new everytime you watch it! I love it, and would highly recommend for anyone who is seeking truth."
3,"Great music, pointless film","Two young white guys went around the world and recorded lots of musical performances in India, Thailand, New Zealand and Africa. They put it all together and made some great music that might remind you a bit of Deep Forest or other such world beat projects.That would have been enough.But they decided to make a film. Which they didn't do as well. It seems that perhaps they had no particular agenda, that they went around talking to whoever would agree to an interview and then later in the editing process put pieces together that seem to fit a thematic whole. Much of it is just arm-chair philosophizing, and from perhaps not too astute philosophers such as former porn star Sharon Mitchell and actor Dennis Hopper. Authors Kurt Vonnegut and Tom Robbins and activist/business woman Anita Roddick make some pointed observations, but the rest could have been left on the cutting room floor.If you have a choice, skip the DVD and buy the CD instead.#"
5,One of my absolute favorite documentaries!!! Watch it and you will love it!,"After a friend suggested this documentary, I went and bought and have bought 5 since then to give to others! It is dynamic, fantastic and ethereal! The commentary mixed with the music will delightfully linger in your thoughts and spirit long after you watch it!"
1,Needs manual imrovement,"The software loaded OK and runs just fine on my Palm Tungsten T3.The problem is the manual. It is hard to navigate and is way too big to print. A good ""Getting Started"" guide would be great to have. It should include some example problems and graphs. Also, keep the methods of entry separate, that is to say, don't show algebraic inputs and RPN inputs on the same page for the same expamle problem. Divide it into separate sections.Ratings? Program 4 stars, Instruction Manual -3"
5,Greg Whincup is a Sensitive Translator,"I was first introduced to Greg's sensitive translation capabilities when I read his translations of the poetry of the Tang Dynasty poets Li Bai and Du Fu. He is probably the best translator of their Tang Dynasty poetry of anyone in the last 100 years. As someone who has also translated their poetry, I can say from experience that this is no ordinary task. Greg is able to accurately present the content is a manner that is able to show you the depth of meaning and width of tangent associations. This brilliance also show through in his translations of the I Ching."
5,Great glasses,I have purhased several pairs of these glasses. Use them all day in the consruction industry. The Bifocal lense section is the perfect size not to big or to small. Comfortable frames that can be worn all day. Style is not bad I also use them for driving and every day wear.Purchase these bifocal glasses with confidence. Shipped quickly and would definately recommend.
1,Contains recipes/ideas reprinted from her other books,"This would have been great if I had never read another book by Emilie Barnes. However, I purchased two of her books at the same time -- and they both contained the same recipes and ideas. Needless to say, I bitterly resent having spent twice the amount to buy two books only to get the content of one repeated twice. Oh, there were a few additions, but none in which I was interested. This is one author I'll never read again."
4,Buena Alternativa,"Acabo de ver la pelicula el dia de ayer (siendo honestos ni siquiera sabía que existía), pero llama la atención el Soundtrack ya que tiene mezclados generos de diversas corrientes musicales, con agrupaciones que dificilmente podremos escuchar en la radio comercial. Si te sobra algo de lana y quieres escuchar musica agradable -principalmente en un termino muy general: Rock, creo que este CD es una buena alternativa para tus oidos. Saludos desde Zapopan. Mork"
4,Great Club Mix,"From the grungiest house to the most sublime vocals over bongos, this CD vibes, boogies, dances & trip hops through sounds I can usually only find after midnight on a college station. From the organ work in John Oszajca's ""Bi-Sexual Chick"" to the classic guitar over synthesizers in 200,000 (in counterfeit fifty dollar bills) by Citizen Cope, this CD presents an amazing range of sounds. Lucie Gamelon's haunting voice makes ""Good Advice."" Crustation's ""Purple"" sublimely trip hops into the grey zone of the subconscious.If your idea of a great blend of sounds is The Greatest Hits of the 70's, then perhaps this isn't the CD for you. But if you like innovative music, sounds that pull out their roots and twist them into something new, consider this as you wonder ""where have all the rock n roll heros gone?"" (Jimmy Tuckett, ""Not Me"")"
2,Self-evident,"If it has never dawned on you that people are different, perhaps this book will help. Otherwise, there's little here that anyone who has thought ten minutes (well, ok, maybe twenty-five) about people won't have already pondered."
1,"Brilliant poem, horrible translation","The Duino Elegies is one of the most breathtaking turns of 20th-century poetry (I don't want to say ""great"" or ""canonical"" here) but it has suffered a long history of bad translations into English that push the agendas of translators over faithfulness to the text. You're better off finding an early translation than picking this up, at least until a (good) poet takes the project on--Jerome Rothenberg, where are you when we need you?"
2,Needs strong audio signal to work well,"You need a strong audio signal to feed this, if you have to set the volume level on the headphones more than half way, it's mostly hiss. Very annoying. Like listening to a vinal record.Tends to drop the signal if you're not very close.I'd also rate the sound quality as so-so, ok for watching TV, if you can avoid the hiss."
4,More Power Scotty,Arrived promptly. Easy install for a dummy (me). My only regret was not getting the larger memory. I did not realize my Dell had only two slots so I had to remove whatI already had
1,Corsair ValueRAM,"I ordered two sticks to upgrade an older machine, an Opteron 185 system. Started having bluescreens as soon as it was installed. Pulled all sticks and tested these: one would not even POST, the other would not boot the system."
4,Good but not great,"The workout is not as exciting as I had hoped. There are several combinations and they get progressively more difficult/complex as the video progresses. The last combination is really fun. The first, by contrast is very repetitive and tedious. Ilaria does a great job explaining the moves and reviewing before she adds to the combination so that it's easy to follow her.As for the effectiveness of the workout, I did sweat a little at the end but expected more cardio; however,my arms, back and chest were very, very sore for two days. It was a great toning workout for the upper body."
3,not for the living room,"great workout, just not so good in the living room, as now i have to buy a new lamp."
4,"good workout, but needs more of a stretching warm up","The Forza workout is relatively easy to follow, and the instructions are clear and precise. My largest concern (as a massage therapist) is that there is not a sufficient stretch before the actual form begins, and users will have to be careful if they are beginners to warm up before doing the technique to avoid injuries to the rotator cuff and trapezius."
2,"Ok work out, but...","This is a good workout if you stick with it. However, whoever the person was filming, spent a lot of time zooming in making it difficult to see what Ilaria was doing."
3,An interesting workout,"I like that this is a different exercise video. It gives me an excuse to swing a sword around and it gets me moving.The issues I have are with the DVD itself. The chapter breaks appear to be random, so it's hard to pick up where you left off. The video quality is good, but the disc looks like the producers cut corners in the video to DVD transfer.I would recommend this to someone who is bored with other exercise videos."
4,"Exercise, not exactly sword tradition","As a method of learning the sword, it leaves something to be desired. As an a workout, it is excellent. It's a good way to interest people in the sword arts, a very gentle introduction."
4,"Hard, but Great!","This is a great DVD, but really difficult. I just tried it for the first few times, and let me tell you, it is going to take me a long time to be able to get through the whole thing; my arms were jelly after just the warm up.The DVD is about an hour, the warm up is about twenty-five minutes, and very intense, then there is a left hand routine, followed by a right hand routine, each are about ten to fifteen minutes long. There is a brief cool down which consists of the right hand routine without the sword.I absolutely recommend this workout, but keep in mind that this is not Carmen Electra's Striptease, or a QuickFix video, this is very different. You'll probably need a Boken sword (wooden practice sword, there are several options here on Amazon) and a pair of good sneakers. I also recommend high ceilings in your excercise area."
4,Amazing,"This is a wonderful, unique workout!! I wish it was a little less time consuming (an hour) but other than that I am completely happy."
4,a good place to start,"If you are interested in yoga and its health benefits, but want to start in the privacy of your own home then this DVD can help. Two routines that will help you work on flexibility without pushing you too far to begin with."
3,"Good instruction, just not my cup of tea","Gaiam's production values are excellent and I understand that Rodney Yee is a well known and respected yogi. The video contains a section with some good form tips on foundational poses for those new to yoga or for anyone needing a refresher course, along with two very short yoga practices. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy either of those two short practices, which seemed somewhat cold and clinical to me - possibly due to the voiceover instruction. Since liking or disliking a DVD for that particular reason is entirely subjective, I wouldn't discourage anyone new to yoga from getting this DVD, but I would suggest checking the web for preview clips before making a decision."
3,"it's good, not great","This is good for stretching, basically. As a work out, I would recommend Yoga Zone's Yoga Sculpting for beginners to intermediate. Now that gets you sweating and all you need is a yoga mat. I will still keep rodney yee to stretch before I use yoga zone because it does give you energy. It also has a session for relaxation. I like it, but for different reasons than listed."
2,I'd Rather Have Rodney,"The Pose Training for Perfect Form was very helpful for someone like me who practices yoga at home. I also liked the option of choosing between the various routines - with guidance or with minimal conversation.I am a fan of Rodney Yee and have bought other of his DVDs. That being said, I didn't buy this DVD to practice yoga with Colleen Saidman. I chose it because it is entitled RODNEY YEE'S Yoga for Beginners. My bad for not investigating more thoroughly and realizing she was half the DVD. Had I known, I would never have bought this DVD. No offense but I don't like her voice and her way of teaching."
5,Good for beginners,"I would recommend this video to those who are looking to ensure they are doing the poses correctly and/or want to have a yoga addition to other workouts. The morning routine is basic and good for beginners, the evening routine is nice and short, and can be used as a cool down after another work out as well. I use this when looking for a more generic yoga workout and interchange it with the AM yoga video with Rodney Yee, which is a bit more advanced and includes workouts that are more targeted."
4,Need Yoga Instruction at Home,"I am relatively new to Yoga but have a profound interest in learning. No Yoga instruction near my home so I've invested in this CD to try to learn as much as I can. The amount of detail is good although hard for me to follow at times. It has helped me to understand how easy it is to do things incorrectly; it is hard for me to correct myself without someone there to advise. Despite that, I am finding this a good instructional video and hope to achieve a better understanding of the positions described."
4,Sort of beginning yoga,Some people have complained that the routines move too fast between poses. This maybe true but you must keep in mind these are beginning routines done in normal speed... I'm 40 lean and fairly athletic but still find a lot of these poses quite challenging. In fact a lot of the harder poses you can work your way into doing but it takes time and patience. The pose guide instruction is helpful in suggesting easier variations to begin with but oddly there are some poses that are missing which are in the routines. Don't be deterred by the negative reviews this is a good DVD. I just think if your completely new to yoga you should take your time use your pose guide first and go through the routines the best you can at your own speed. Eventually you'll catch up to the pace and your flexibilty will benefit.
5,Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners - a great intro,I bought Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners for my husband - a yoga newbie.He was skeptical about yoga.. but I insisted that it is helpful for stretchingand strengthening. He watched it through once and then lookedforward to the practice!I practice the morning and evening routines with him - I LOVE the extended instructions for each pose. Colleen and Rodney outline the correct form for each pose and the common mistakes. And it is easy to navigate to a specific pose.The morning and evening routines are 20 minutes each - perfect for my husband!And perfect for me on those days when I don't have an hour or just want a short refreshing session.I highly recommend these DVDs.
3,Description & Title of CD Misleading,Before purchasing this CD I read the reviews and was impressed with how impressed people were with it. The CD is very well done but the description of the CD and the title were misleading. I found the poses difficult for me to do and it just didn't seem like a beginners guide to yoga. I will have to find a yoga CD that is geared for people who are not in tip top shape because this was not it.
2,Too Short Even for beginners,It is good overall but WAY TOO SHORT. Cool down just as you get started It needs to be longer.
3,Yoga for Beginners,"This program is designed for beginners, however it is also advanced enough to give you your moneys worth of use. When I started the program a month ago I could do very few of the exercises and forms. Since then with good reasonable practice I feel that I am much more flexible and have successfully completed many of the forms that I previously had much difficulty with. I would recommend this product because no matter what your fitness level you can use it for several months to improve your flexibility and stamina.When you purchase this product, be sure to have purchased a mat and yoga blocks. They are not very expensive but are very good tools to use."
3,"Good, but yoga part too short","Really good for beginners and 40 minutes of pose definition is helpful (once) BUT, the actual yoga part is too short at only 20 minutes including warm up and cool down. The 15 minute relaxation section is nice to use before bedtime.Only giving 3 stars due to short length. Will now have to buy and try another one."
3,"Eh, Yoga isn't for me?","I thought I'd try yoga out to get that ""healthy lifestyle"" agenda going, but this disk just didn't do it for me. Too many of the moves require your head down and I can't see what they're doing to change etc. Yes its relaxing but I feel it doesn't do enough athletically? Stretching feels more productive, but maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance?"
5,Ideal for beginners,"If you are new to yoga or need a refresher course, this is the dvd for you. The key is the pose guide For the first few weeks of owning this video I watched nothing but the pose guide. I just kept working on balance, form, and comfort. Once I felt like I knew what I was doing I started doing the yoga practices. I still go back and run through the pose guide every now and then just to remind myself of common mistakes."
5,Love it!,I have been using the old VHS of Rodney Yee's AM/PM yoga for years. I finally decided to update my routine and am glad I did. I love this dvd and definitely recommend it. It's perfect for either beginngers or those of us with health issues who cannot do a high impact/high cardio workout.
4,Good Beginning Yoga Video,"I've been thinking about doing yoga for a while now, but bought this DVD on a whim two weeks ago. I've gotten more than my share of use out of it already! I like it because I feel like it's easy enough for a complete beginner like me, but I didn't feel like I was being ""babied"" or anything. The workouts - especially the ""relaxing"" one - are effective, and I always feel happy and actually stress-free when I'm done with them. Also, the instruction is exceptionally clear and the DVD comes with a ""pose guide"" so you can make sure you have the correct form. The only thing I would have liked is maybe a few more different workouts on the DVD."
2,too slow,There are about 5 intros that you have to watch prior to getting to the exersize. The program is easy but way to short.
4,Good for beginners,This DVD is good for beginners. I did yoga in high school and this is helping me get back into that shape and flexibility.
2,"Good poses, bad instruction","While the poses are great for beginners, the instruction leaves a lot to be desired. Some poses are skipped over entirely. Sometimes you're told whether to inhale or exhale, but this is inconsistent.I saw another review preferred Rodney to Colleen; I'm the opposite -- though they both have similar issues, I generally find her a little easier to follow."
1,Bad Yoga --too fast,There is not enough time on each pose and the changing positions is too fast and I have been doing yoga for years!!! DO NOT BUY THIS...you will be dissappointed or like me have a sprain in your right shoulder!!
1,Not for Beginners,"This instructor has no clue what a true beginner can do (or can't do). I've purchased probably 10 beginner DVDs and this is by far the worst. Unless you can already bend in half and stand on your head, this video is not for you."
1,Review,The dvd was scratched. I sent the product back for this reason. There was not another one available to replace it.
1,I AM NOT HAPPY,I had a VHS of Rodney Yee's beginners Yoga and was supper happy with it.I used it for many years and it was simple and my waistline shrink beautifully.However this DVD is full of commercials and it is frustrating to get to the good part.Some of the exercises are not for a chubby beginner like me. twisting the body and some other ones are impossible for me to do.Also they keep showing what is wrong and then tell you this is wrongso since I am following the tape I do it and find out this is the wrong pose.I simply do not like this product it is too complicated and I wish I could just copy my VHS to DVD (which is illegal)I hate this DVD and stuck with it.
2,Dvd scratched,I enjoy the workouts on the DVD but it was scratched when I received it and one of the workout portions skips. I have reordered and hope to get one that is more user friendly or it will be returned. Otherwise the information on the Dvd is good with great explanations of the poses for the beginner.
2,Been using these for a yr now and wanna update my review,"Overall they work good but now that I have used 3/4 of the sleeve, I must say that I have had at least 10 dvds have errors while writing. I only use them for movies and I use the same method and programs for ripping and burning every time. I originally bought them because of the positive reviews for lack of issues while burning and playing. They do play in all dvd players but like I said I have wasted at least 10 and I have about 25 blanks ones left so you do the math on how many more will most likely be bad."
4,Great Disc,"I only buy these now, you very rarely ever wasted one, if you do it's usually the software rather than the disc itself."
4,"DVDs work great, but hard to tell burnable side from top","These DVDs work great, but hard to tell burnable side from top (the top is very shiny and only slightly less blue."
5,Tough Discs,"Taiyo Yuden has a rep for making quality, long lasting discs. I have not had my discs around long enough to test this out, but I can tell you this much: they are extremely substantial discs, not at all flimsy."
2,Disappointed,I just received a pack of these. Already tried to burn 5 discs. Capacity is supposed to be 4.7 GB. The Photodex show I tried to burn is 52 minutes (capacity supposedly 120 Minutes) All of them stopped after 47-48 minutes.Could not even get the full show on it. Very disappointed.
5,The Legindary Norden Bombsight,"I absolutely love this book. My father served as a bombardier and instructor on the B24 Liberator during WWII. This book reinforces what he has tried to instill in me for nearly 50 years regarding the operation of the sight. In addition I have learned numerous facts about the development and testing of the sight that I was never aware of, in particular just how involved the United States Navy was in its development and testing. If there is anyone out there who shares the desire to learn about the sight, I strongly recommend that they read this book."
1,Audrey Hepburn's movie Roman Holiday,"I bought a 3-pack Audrey Hepburn DVD set. The one called Roman Holiday had many scratches on the playing side which meant very rough handling by a previous owner. I thought I had paid for an unused DVD. This particular DVD plays well up to 95 % of its length; then it gets stuck and will not play even after multiple forward prods. The other 2 DVDs of the set are free of scratches but I have not played them yet.But wait, there's a surprise. A couple of days ago I saw the weatherman Al Roker on the NBC AM show and he said if we rub a banana over a scratched DVD and then rub it off, the DVD should play. That's what I did and it worked!!!! Since I don't know if this is a permanent fix I think I should get a free replacement."
2,Uh Oh,"Two of the three were fine, but the third was scratched beyond belief and wouldn't play at all. Unfortunately, I realized this after the return date, so I was stuck with the broken DVD and had to repurchase one of the movies. I'm glad the other two work!"
2,My satisfaction is only 2/3!,"There are three DVDs in this collection. One of them (Romain Holiday) plays only 10 minutes, then it quits. I tried a lot of times but I still didn't get to watch the movie."
4,3 movies in one,I got this dvd as a Christmas gift for a friend. She's a Hepburn fan. It was nice getting three movies on one disc.
5,Ball Bearing fan,Prompt shipping and product works fine. I would recomment to anyone.I use it in a battery charger in place of original that failed
1,Barrett Anderson,"Be cautious if you buy this book. Despite the disclaimer that ""This book may have occasional imperfections . . . that were either part of the original artifact, or were introduced by the scanning process."", every page has numerous ""imperfections"". The print more often looks like hieroglyphics of some sort, and appear to be the result of poor scanning. You may need a clean copy of the original to determine what you're missing. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!History of Placer county, California"
3,Dry,"I almost gave it 2 stars but decided in all fairness it did deserve 3. After all the reason I didn't like the book is that it was very dry, a lot of facts, and Anne isn't mentioned in ways that allow you to get a lot of info on her, as herself.However, it DOES say it's a cultural biography so my disappointment is my own fault.I wouldn't reccomend it for anyone looking for a biography or for light reading. However if your looking for info on Anne, you'll have to make do since there are very few other resources on her."
5,Great movie,"Bought this for my 3 yr old son. He loves it. For those Blue's Clues fan, it gives you the beginning of how Joe came into the picture. My son and i found it sad though to see Steve leave. Joe is amazing, but i have been attached to Steve since 1996. hehehehe."
2,It's okay,"My major issue with this movie is that Saif Ali Khan is not a nice guy in this movie, which made me sad. He's a great actor, and the movie, was okay. My major problem is that the summary was misleading; you never want Saif and the girl to get together since he is such a creep!"
3,Modern Freud,"Frued's approach to sex and psychoanalytic interpretations had a great impact on our culture. --PJ Adams, author of Freud's Revenge"
5,EXTRAORDINARY,"I bought El Puma's PIEL DE HOMBRE when I was in Spain in 1992 and it is one of my favorite CDs in any language. Here is a man with a voice that gives full expression to music and exceptional lyrics. Sorry but Julio Iglesias and especially his son Enrique don't deserve the fame that JLR does (maybe it's better to keep the secret!). On MIS 30 MEJORES you'll find a few from PIEL and don't miss his duet with Rocio Jurado (which see) entitled AMIGO AMOR--these 2 voices are meant for each other! Remarkable. Wonderful. Gracias, Jose Luis!"
4,just what i needed,It is great to have both dic and thes in one. Dont have to look for two books. My kids like using it. Makes writing papers easier...
3,"coulda, shoulda, been better",an appealing combination of dictionary and thesaurus; but the dictionary -- both the number of entries and the wording -- disappointed me.
3,Comprehensive Dictionary,"It appears to contain everything a layman would want to know about spelling and meanings of words. Stuffed with crowded print, nonetheless bulky and heavy."
3,Large Letters,"I do like this dictionary but I wish the words were in a larger print. If I had a chance to do it over again, I would have picked a dictionary with larger print"
4,2008 Dodge ram 1500 4.7l,"I put these in my truck and it runs a little smother now, dont notice to much a difference but i am happy with them so far and its easy to do yourself if you can access the holes to unscrew and put them in. remember to use the lube to coat the plugs when putting the in. ask your local car place like autozone."
3,Do NOT buy for 2009 Dodge Charger with 3.5L V6,"So I didn't give a 0 star review, but I will say that these plugs do not fit into a 2009 Dodge Charger with a 3.5L V6. The plugs are 1/4 inch short on each side of the nut (1/2"" total) which will not allow them to mate properly in the coil or have the correct spark location.I'm not saying they're bad plugs, because they're probably great in the right vehicle, I just wanted to warn people that there's an error in which car these go to. If you go to Bosch's website, they do not show this plug for this car."
4,Satisfied,There were markings that were not identified in the description but over all I love the book and am happy with my purchase
5,delicious,This is a must have for any juicy artist! Mariko Mori's work is simply lovely and very exciting. The book is visually enthralling and I HIGHLY recommend it!
2,Excellent special effects in DUMB Godzilla ghost movie,"Forget radioactive monsters. Forget every movie up to this point. Now we have all the angry war dead spirits from WW2 going into Godzilla and he looking like a fat blind aligator (with a beer belly) attacking Tokyo! Oh no! Now Baragon, Mothera and Ghidra are spirits awoken by a weird old man and different groups of uncarring idiots (who get theirs) and the battle begins to stop the possessed Godzilla. Special effects are the best I've seen in these recent movies- REALLY GOOD- but the story...... What ever happened to monster island and radioactive beasties wasn't that hard enough to swallow??"
1,horrible,"This Godzilla movie epitomizes everything that can go wrong in this genre. Godzilla is not supposed to be magical and involved with enemies who look like Barney rejects. The effects in this movie suck, and the monsters look horrible. There is way too much focus on stupid human sub-plots (as usual) and bad pacing. The score is also horrible and only features the famous themes at the very last shot & credits. The original Gojira was scary, serious, and held a lot of symbolisms. This movie is garbage."
5,one of his finest,"I would rate this as one of Godzilla's finest showings. His sullen white eyes seem to mesmerize one... Literally the use of modern technology has produced a serious wrecking machine. In essense, this would be the Oscar performance of the big guy. I've watched this time and time again... always appreciating the plot & production."
3,"Great movie, but poor DVD!","Let's get one thing straight. GMK is the best Godzilla flick since Destroy All Monsters. No, It's not perfect, but It's highly original, well developed, emotional, and entertaining! The reason I am writing this review, however, is to tell everyone that this DVD is very underwhelming. While the picture and audio are outstanding, the subtitles are just based off of the dub and there are no extras. So what's the problem with dubtitles you ask? Well nothing, except for the fact that every serious moment is ruined in this film due to a sloppy rewrite of the script by the dubbers. Godzilla fans had to wait years for this film and Tristar didn't even bother hiring someone that spoke Japanese? I call that lazy. Maybe fans should petition for a new DVD with accurate sub's. As a side note I will tell you that every other Tristar Godzilla DVD except for GxMG has dubtitles as well. SAD!!! Common, how about a petition?"
2,Baragon returns,"I really did not care for this movie. Well I enjoyed the return of Baragon, special effects and Godzilla. I didn't really like King Ghidorah as a ""good Guy"". Also, besides Baragon I'm tired of viewing the same old monsters. I heard they were going to use Baragon, Rodan and Varan but were concerned that these creatures were not as marketable as Mothra and Ghidorah. I would have liked it they used the original script with Varan, Baragon and Rodan. For me This is worth watching only once or twice. Give it a spin to at least see Baragon and Godzilla."
3,There is no sleeping during Godzilla movies!,"I fell asleep watching this movie; not that this movie is the worst, (that distinction goes to Godzilla vs. Megalon!) but the actual fight scences that we Godzilla fans have come to love take SOOOOOOOO LOOOOOONG to get there!However, once the monsters Mothra, Baragon, and Kong Ghidorah finally fight Godzilla, it's a pleasure to watch. This DVD comes with both English and Japanese soundtracks, so if you ever were curious as to how the actors REALLY sound like without the dubbing, now's the chance.I also found the humor at the start of the movie very good when two soldiers wonder if the Godzilla that attacked NYC recently was the real deal; a slap in the face to the U.S. Godzilla movie that came out in 1998 with Matthew Broaderick.So, all in all, this movie will be entertaining, once you get past the boring parts."
4,Groovy.,"Hey, I'm not complaining. This is the best piece of rubber-suit mayhem to cross over the pond in at least ten years. Hey, it's not as socially relevant as ""Gojira"" or as downright fun as ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla"", but it's better than ""Godzilla 2000"" and certainly better than that piece of expensive computer-generated garbage that (sane) men call ""Fraudzilla"". And maybe they didn't keep Varan and Angilas, but at least they dropped Ourga and Matthew Broderick. Lets hope this is the Sean Connery of Godzilla films, here to rip the franchise out of the Lazenbine hands of the past."
3,The fat Godzilla,"The big G is back and fatter than ever. The story is different in this movie, and I'm annoyed how they just push all the other godzilla movies out of the way. The three monsters who fight Godzilla, who are called Guardian monsters, are called Beragon, the newcomer, Mothra, the peacemaker and Ghidorah, the villian that has now turned hero. Godzilla's cool, his attitude being one of the crappiest I've ever seen, but they make him way too fat in this movie; and he's walks too upright to me. I think it's good, and Godzilla has done it again."
5,This movie rocks !,I was totally surprised when I watched this movie. I have always like Godzilla movies. I liked how he was redesigned for Godzilla 2000. But this movie takes his looks to a new level. This is one evil looking Godzilla. And the movie has knockout special effects. I have already watched this movie at least 5 times since I bought it. Great great movie.
5,One of the Best Godzilla Films,"Don't let the title fool you, this is a great entry in the Godzilla series. Big G is back and badder than ever. This movie has a solid story line and lots of action. While Godzilla doesn't look as good as he does in the other Godzilla Millenium series movies, he is shown as highly intelligent and evil in this one. Mothra, Baragon and King Ghidorah (normally an evil monster, here he is good) all team up to fight the Godzilla menace with help from the Japanese Defense forces. The effects are fantastic and it is a treat to see Big G back in action. The extras are skimpy, not as good as the ones on Final Wars, but if you are a Godzilla fan, this is a must have because it is a well made and interesting movie."
4,The Second Surprise Ending Godzilla Movie,This film takes place 50 years after when Gojira(Thats what they call Godzilla In Japan) set his big radioactive foot on tokeo. I was surprised by the surprise ending. But King Ghidorah a hero?!! Weird. But his heads look like the chinese dragon. Good thing the roar and gold scales were there. The film has a boring part that is about 30 minutes. Just so you don't get bored they stick in little cool parts so you don't fall asleep. The military think they killed Gojira at the end.Even Thou Mothra apeares in this the fairys don't. This was good but if you have to choose between this in Godzilla Final Wars chooses GFW.
1,Gen-Why??,Even the martial arts sequences can't save 'Gen-Y Cops.' Here we have a perfect example of Asian slapstick run amok. I don't know what else to say except the movie is just plain goofy and a total waste of time. For you Maggie Q fans out there who are thinking about buying or renting this film to see her forget it. Her part is sooo.. minisule you might just miss her altogether.
3,Avalanche safety,"being a beginer of mountaineering i bought this book so i would not get trapped in an avalanche and so i could learn some basic mountain safety. The book was quit easy to read but very detailed, it covers most of the skills needed for mountain safty. I recomend it to any one who is going to venture out into the mountains soon."
5,Excellent alternative music cd from an unknown band,This is an excellent cd from Magna-Fi. I have an extensive collection of 200+ cds and this is one of my favorites. It has the flavor of foo-fighter drive in the songs and a nice mix of fast and mellow songs. Song 12 ( Bradbury heights ) is one of my favorites. I will always like the song. Excellent guitar work and lyrics that are incredible. Enjoy for anyone who owns this cd
3,"It's good, but...","...I just can't get over the fact that the first song- Where Did We Go Wrong- is a seemingly blatant ripoff of the song I Know You Love Me by The Smoking Popes. The music is the same and even the first sentence of both songs are eerily similar.Overall, Magna Fi's album is good with some solid songs. I especially like This Life, Beautiful and Seconds, Minutes, Hours."
4,Interactive and Interesting,"I found this text to be a very interactive one, keeping students attention by involving them in the learning process. While it may be simplified in some areas, it is a first year text and does cover the topics clearly and coherently.As far as first year texts go, I found this to be a useful and interesting one."
3,Psychology 101 book,This book provides basic insights into psychology and the way people behave. I purchased it for my Psych 101 class and it is exactly what the professor talks about in lecture.
3,Not that great,"This was the book my school chose as it's General Psychology book. It wasn't very good. In fact, I strongly disliked it. It simplified some problems, while completely ignoring others. It did have some good points, but the majority of the book was skewed to match the thoughts and beliefs of the writers. Very .... book!"
3,moderate,"psychology is not a real science, and this is not a real textbook. Actually almost all of the pages in this book are devoted to finding out what psychology is. How can you learn any thing from a book which author don't know what psychology is?May be i'm wrong or prejudiced, but psychology is not a science, and i don't like it.if you're searching for a text and learning psychology because you have to, then i think Kalat's text is better."
2,Pass on this series,Not even close to the Donna Leon's great books. Maybe it's the German dialogue when we're expecting to hear Venetian Italian.
4,Ex-boyband Blue star goes solo.,"Uusally after the great success of their boyband or girlband background, many think of solo success as an artist. Few have done it like Robbie Williams and Ronan Keating. Simon Webbe's debut album is a suprising smash. It doesn't sound like a ""Blue"" album at all. He went with a more pop acoustic feel, smooth R&B and country vibe. It has a little Lighthouse Family groove to it. His top tracks are Lay Your Hands On Me, No Worries, After All This Time, A Little High, Free, Only Love, and Sanctuary. The bonus AVCD includes Simon's 3 videos and Simon talks about each track on camera. It also includes two remixes and B-sides. So here's to Simon Webbe's solo success!! Hopefully like That Take, the boys will get back together in a few years."
5,Best I've Heard in a While....,"Maybe this CD just caught me at the right moment, but I haven't enjoyed listening to a CD this much in a while. There is a very mellow, very summery sound to this CD. But even more strongly evident than that is the uplifting quality of the songs here. If Simon Webbe never sang or lisened to gospel music, I'd be very, very, very surprised, as it's written all over this album. There are times I've just wanted to lift my hands and sing. And it's not just the sound, but the lyrics, too. Redemption, unending love, waking up to the one you love, angels, sin, hope.Very warm, very classy, very uplifting. This is going to be a stand-by for some time."
4,---,alright..i havent heard all of the songs on the album..actually came online trying to hear the clips..but 'no worries' is actually quite good..its just one of those 'feel good' songs.
5,GREAT BOOK!,"I, like any other kid/teen hated math and then I read this book. Now I'm looking all over for what has to do with math. I never knew how much math was all over. I recommend this book to anybody that wants to pull thier hair out during thier math homework. Even if you like math this book is great!"
2,Not too syked,"I was not very syked when I got this book. After reading so much about it I thought it would be a good buy for my daughter who I have trouble getting to enjoy or even be interested in doing well in math. It is written to the student, which I thought was odd. And is aimed at a higher age group than she is (7 yrs). I just don't have time to read so much about it and play the little games etc. Very disappointed."
1,No go,"My 9 year old son did not like this book. He said, ""you got me a book that says I hate Match, but then the author says that math is great. That makes no sense, Mom!"" He's tried to pick it up a couple of times, but it has not sparked his interest."
5,made my life,"I read this book as a kid at least 15 years ago. I can still remember many topics and even the layout of some pages. This is a great gift for a kid interested in math; it is friendly, fun, and yet substantive. It is an infinite well of cool stuff. I seem to have stumbled into a career in research mathematics now. Looking back, this book may be the main reason. I have never stopped thinking of mathematics as ""cool stuff""."
3,Meh.,"I read this book in my childhood and now once again. I always liked the other book, ""Math for Smarty Pants"" much better, and still do. That book contained a bit of cute, quirky storytelling, with the reappearing characters in the comics as well as the Pig Eyes. This book, while just as quirky and does take math in a new light, doesn't have the hook the first had. Don't get me wrong, it was a great read and I'm sure it would do wonders for reluctant math students, but it is certainly not the best Marilyn Burns has to offer. The other thing, and there is a note in the back about it, is the lack of answers. Many questions are posed to problems that just can't really be solved at the given time, but you're left with no answer, not even a hint. This is quite bothersome.Rating: 2.5/5"
1,Not worth it!,"I was so hyped up to see this movie-but I was so let down.It was boring,stupid,the acting was so horrible.If I could give it an lower mark than I would.Don't waste your money-nor time on this one"
2,half the package,"If you have Verbatim Digital Vinyl CD-Rs you've probably run into a problem: how do you label them? There isn't much room to write on them and conventional labels would ruin the nostalgic look -- even if you could get them to stick.You'll need these labels -- they're the right size to fit on the core without covering the vinyl look-alike surface. Unfortunately, you'll also need software, or at least a template, to print the labels, and this package doesn't have any software. I tried Verbatim's website, but no software there, either. I sent them a request for info, but that was weeks ago and they haven't answered me. I'm no longer holding my breath."
2,wasteful bad cover up,"There has got to be another answer!What a wasteful manner - this design. Each 5 x 11 page contains two labels. That is it. Two labels. The remainder of the page is labels for jewel cases and other random things I will never use. Besides that, the cover-up is not ideal. The white label is nearly see-thru... Anyway, I just got the package in the mail today, and I also bought the special Label Kit from Verbatim, but I feel like it was a big waste of money and space, and I am going to look for other options."
2,Could be much better,"Verbatim doesn't make it clear on the packaging that you're supposed to use their special label application contraption (sold separately), as well as the software to print on the labels. As it is, I already have a CD label applicator, but no... You need the SPECIAL one for these. Nice. Must we insist on proprietary equipment for something as simple as a CD label? C'mon, Verbatim. You can do better."
2,A Good Book with too many details,"To be nice, I'll say Dragonwings was a very touching story. But I was forced to read it, because it was a class assignment. The problem is the : beginning, middle, and end. The beginning made no sense. THe middle just bored me. THe ending left me a few questions... "" WHAT? ITS ENDING LIKE THAT? BUT WHAT ABOUT.... "" If there was supposed to be a point in this book, either I missed it, or there isnt any except for the fact that Laurence YEp read an article and was so touched by it, he decided to make an horrible, FAKE story out of an INCREDIBLE story about an Asian individual ( Im Asian and I know how hard it is to find stories with Asians as the hero/heroine ) As for the excrutiatingly painfully LONG details, I would bet all my money that Laurence Yep only wrote them to make up for the bad storyline."
3,Boring at times,"I found this book quite boring and hope not to read it ever again. Though the premise was interesting, it wasn't adventurous, romantic, or anything a historical novel usually is. Instead, it was a plain, historical novel."
3,dragon wings,"I believe that the author does a good job at portraing thecharactors of this book. The book is very easy to believe because wesee the same things in todays socioty, and in the end how all people come to gethar to form one big group."
1,This was one of the WORST books I have ever read!,"This book is basically about a young boy who moves from China to America with his father. His father is trying to build an airplane. At the end of the book his dad finally gets his plane to fly. That is the whole plot of the book. It is so boring, it almost put me to sleep. The only reason I read it was because I had to read it for school, and even then, I only read up to about the last few chapters. I hated this book, and I don't reccomend it to anyone else."
1,SOOOOO boring,This is by far the most boring book I have ever read. I am currently in 9th grade and was forced to read this book in 6th grade. Even now I remember loathing reading it. It was dull and pointless. The only chapter I remember being remotely interesting is when the kid flies a kite or something. If I had the choice of becoming a millionare over a second reading I suppose my future would not be a posperous one.
1,snooze fest,"horribleI am 13 years old and I hate this bookwe read it in english class this year. About two people actually fell asleep reading it in 5th period. Really boring. There was one exciting part to the story. The names are hard to keep track of. I also don't like the fact that all throughout this book the boy refers to the white men as ""demons"". At first I thought the book was suposed to teach a lesson. But in the end it didn'tdon't buy this book"
3,Dragonwings,"This was an excellent book written through the eyes of a Chinese boy who comes to America and lives among white people, adjusting to their ways and making new friends. Laurence Yep does a wonderful job of portraying the world through the eyes of and immigrant in a new place. He shows the hardships as well as the good times. After reading this book I looked at life a little bit differently. Moonshadow and his dad shared the same dream of flying. And Windrider his father is being tested in this life to become a dragon in the next and by flying he might be able to accomplish this. Windrider shares wonderful dreams woth Moonshadow about being a dragon. The story is filled with love, trust and dishonesty. This is a book I would reccommend to anyone. This book helped me in my personal life as well. Now i know what it's like to be in a new place, and I will help people in a similar situation out and not make fun of them becausce I know I wouldn't want to be treated that way myself."
3,"Not an action book, but it was well written.","Dragonwings is a book that is about a Chinese man and his son,who migrate over to America. They have a dream to fly like the Wright Bothers. They migrated over to America from China leaving their loved ones there. They are faced with the struggle of discriminaton from the Americans. They had a lot of hardships that the Americans didn't have to deal with. I think that this should not have happened. The Chinese did a lot. The Chinese brought a lot of culture and ethnic diversity to this nation. The book is a bit boring, but at the end, it takes off and gets exciting."
1,Save your soul and not read this,I was forced to read this book in school and I hated it this guy had thought he was a dragon come on what does that say.
2,"Enough with the ""demon"" stuff!","This book has an average plot and interesting characters. However, I did not appreciate the fact that North Americans were stereotyped as ""demons"". I understand that the boy wasn't gifted mechanically, but the puzzlement with everything was annoying at times. The book got better as it went on, but it was still not good enough for me to classify it as ""average""."
2,Good storyline But too many details,"This book's storyline appeared interesting when I looked at the back of the book and I was eager to read it for the class assignment. Since I am Asian, I know how hard it is to find Asians as the hero/heroine. As I was reading it, many racial comments in the book disturbed me. For example, the words "" Ching-Chong Chinaman "" came up a few times in the book, provoking my classmates to start staring at me and grin. Of course, I was too busy trying to understand the details, to tell them what they deserved at the time. Details are what make a story a story, but too many details just confuse the reader. Laurence Yep probably wrote this book, imagining what it would be like to be read by a non-asian reader. Even the 1000 times that the word ""demon"" popped up, seemed to bother me."
1,"ZZZ, oh, what are we talking about?","Dragonwings is an okay, so-so story about a boy (Moonshadow) and his dad (windrider) who want to build the newfangled invention an aeroplane. The story is confusing, and when they don't understand an english word, it's spelled out in a way where you have to pronounce it to find out what it means. Moonshadow is an innagrant from China and faces problems dealing with his race. It's the book I had to read for my social studies homework and I say, ""Get it from the library,"""
1,I am oppressed by horrible literature.,"This book was the most painfully terrible book that I have ever had the displeasure to have seep into my oppressed mind. The characters are delusional. I mean, if a guy thinks that once upon a time, he was a dragon, he is most likely mentally impaired. This book should sooner be chosen for torture purposes in gulags or concentration camps than in a 7th grade english class. If you are interested in purchasing this book, I suggest that you refrain from reading it, and use it as a fire-starter instead."
1,Disapointing,"I thought this book was disapointing. When I first decided to read the book it looked informative and interesting. I found a stereotypical, drawn out, boring and all together unpleasent reading experience."
1,what is boring about this book?,"I could not even read the whole book! I read the beginning, middle, and end. I believe many of those chapters could have been ripped out, and the book would be the same, but less boring. I was made to read it at school. The detail went COMPLETELY over the top. It took yep three pages to describe the climbing up a hill as a ""family"". It was also kind of sappy in places, and went much too far into the whole family life thing. This book is for someone who has a lot of extra time on their hands."
1,Pitiful Excuse for Literature,"This was one of the worst books I have had the displeasure of reading. I was required to read this book for my 7th grade literature class and must state that I was not at all impressed. The book lacked any kind of plot and the boys father was quite obviously insane. It is characters like those in this book that make me feel ashamed to be the same species as them. If this book had a climax, I couldn't find it. It is basically just the story of some chinese people who come to america and the boys father believes that he was formerly a dragon. After a number of absolutely pointless things happen to them. His father builds an airplane and it flys. I did not like this book and would not reccomend it to anyone."
1,A COMPLETE Waste of Time,Oh my God why did i have to read this lame behind book. I hated it but hatred dosent even begin to explain how much this book sucked. It is way to detailed and one chapter is like 30 pages long and only about tea wat 4.
4,Dragonwings CD,Enjoyed B.D. Wong's interpretive reading of the novel. He does read at a rather slow pace though. Over all very enjoyable.
4,good for learning Eglish,"Dragonwings was a good novel and interesting book. The book use a lot of easy words,it should be helped student who study English. When I have done with this book, I think about next story for Dragonwings because the book was very interesting about flying. Also, the book explaned about the typical Chinese stereotype when the emmigrants lived in west area of America. If you find a book,I recommend for Dragonwings. You can not lose your time."
3,illustrates varities of themes.,"This book, Dragonwings, is full of emotions, including sadness,happiness, fighting, suffering, perseverance, dream, and comedy. It expresses some stereotypes about americans ,and it also points out the good relationship between Chinese immigrants and Americans. The main theme mentions about one Chinese immigrant, who had left his family to work in Demon land. He was full of dreams ,and he believed that he was a dargon in the past life. He tried to construct his dream to become true with builted glider and plane. He wish to fly as a dragon. However, finally, he had knew that nothing was more important than his family. I can learn the ideas of different culture that help me open my mind widely.I like this book. It is useful to read it- good novle."
3,AN INTERESTING NOVEL,"I am an ESL student in GSU. I am from Peru and this is my opinion about this novel. Dragonwings was a good and an interesting book. This story gave me a lot of information about the typical Chinese stereotype when they arrived in the 1900s. That story is special because is narrated by a kid who is showing us how he and his father survived in a new culture, and how the family loves predominate above everything else."
5,A thrilling book!!!,I really liked this book. It was about a boy that went to San Fransisco.He went to visit his dad and find work. He then met a girl that was his father`s boss` niece. There was a giant earthquake and they had to rescue trapped people. That was the earthquake of 1607. This book was thrilling and I will continue to read more books by him.
3,A story about China,"I am an ESL student from GSU. I was assigned to read this book in my extensive reading/vocabulary class. I didn't like this book at the beginning, because I thought it was boring. After I read and I found that it was quite interesting. In this book, I learned a lot of things, such as vocabulary, what is important in my life, and how to make it easier, etc. Laurence Yep mentioned detaily in people's emotions and their different characters. Yep listed out how people felt after they left their home, and went to a stranger's place for work. In addition, he also stated how was a life for a little boy, and how he managed it. In general, it was a little bit long. Finally, according to the last chapter of the text book, I knew the ""Family"" is the most important in my life."
4,good,"Dragonwings is a powerful book, that I had to do for a novel study. I, at first thought it was ridiculous, but once I got into it, the characters develloped and the plot thickened. It is well written and well discribed. I liked it!"
4,Gentle music,Another Kaempfert album that is full of beautiful music. If you are looking for something to put on in the background while you relax with a good book and a wine after a hectic day this for me is the ticket. I could say that any of his albums would meet that bill but this is particularly smooth.
2,Be careful,"When i first heard this CD i thought they had a very bad reproducing machinery,then i read the booklet that came with the CD and found out Bert Kampfert's daughter and his lead trumpeter started a band and where playing Bert's arrangments,but believe me they aren't in the same class as the originals.We all know how many bands go around playing someone elses music (Glenn Miller,etc) and they are just lousy copies of the originals,this is an example."
5,Excelence,"The Best of Bert KaempfertBeing a first time customer with Amazon, I was extremely satisfied and impressed with the quality and the speed of delivery of this CD."
5,Carrys Away The Gold,"In my opinion, a great recording MUST be a marriage of not only a great performance but, also great sound. This blu-ray disc with DTS Master Audio DELIVERS!. I am not familiar with the Prokofiev so I don't feel qualified to comment. The Mahler first, ever since I was at a live performance by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, is one of my favorite pieces. As of now, in my opinion, this is the VERY best recording of this piece that I own or have heard, by a considerable margin. The 1080i video is very good also and shows how much physical labor is involved by the various musicians."
5,mahler symph #1 prokofiev piano concerto #3,"I am still waiting to have a poor performance from an orchestra being conducted by Claudio Abbado. He is a talent of the kind that is very rare in this age oftheatrics and shallow musical knowledge. His rendition of the Mahler symphony #1 was impeccable, cohesive ( and that is a challenge with Mahler), and fullof intrinsic musicality. As to the performance of pianist Yuja Wang of the Prokofiev piano concerto #3? What else can you add to all the amazing reviews thatthis brilliant young girl is getting from all aver the world? This is a great dvd."
3,The Downward Spiral,"The League of Gentlemen peaked early and they peaked high. There was really no room for improvement following the stellar first season of this hilarious show. The show took a turn away from it's roots in the second season and, by the third it had strayed very far afield.Season three is very inconsistent, with some episodes such as ""The Lesbian and the Monkey"" being absolutely hilarious. Others, such as ""How the Elephant Got It's Trunk,"" are not only not funny, but stupid as well. In between are some episodes which aren't terribly good, but aren't terribly bad either. In the end it's just hard to get away from the abysmal ""Elephant"" episode, which is just painful to watch. Really Season three deserves two and one half stars, but that isn't an option."
4,Dunkirk,"I first saw this movie on tv when I was a kid on a UHF station. At the time, it wouldnt have even been 10 years since it had been made, but have not seen it since. This isn't an 'action' movie, rather it is more of an episodic couple of days at the beach with some French soldiers, one of whom hopes to be evacuated after they had be surrounded by the German army in the early days of WW2."
5,Great knife,"THis is a great knife, it is everything I expected. It's good looking, sharp, and very well built. I reconmend this knife to anyone looking for a stainless steal knife."
4,"""Interesting""","Glenn Kimball's compacted work begins with a summary of biblical origins, the canonization of the scriptures, and a segment on the nature and origin of the Early Church. Also included is a short definition of the word apocrypha, which Kimball insists orginally meant ""one too sacred and secret to be in everyone's hands."" However, its etymoligical derivative, which is rendered into apocrypha by joining apo-(away)+kryptein(to hide)=Greek apocryphos, does not suggest Kimball's definition. The stories found here are very interesting, and are full of tales not only of the young Messiah's life and deeds, but of the lives of Mary and Joseph, and the rest of Jesus' family as well. While these hidden stories may seem a bit jejune to the sceptic, they will still nevertheless be a fascinating collection of extra-biblical stories for the individual seeking knowledge on the early life of Christ; and they will also be a fair study companion for the search of the historical Jesus."
2,Interesting,"Easy reading with a lot of new material presented but not for anyone who would pursue the subject further. The bibliography contains no more than a listing of the sources. Where can these original documents be found? Information is not much good unless it can be verified by the sources. Otherwise, it remains just another good read."
1,"A Book of Ignorance, Arrogance and Marketing.","What a circus, what a show, the best deal in town a book on Jesus' childhood written by marketers masquerading as experts. The ignorance come from the many misunderstood poorly researched and misinterpreted ancient texts. The Arrogance comes from thinking they know it all. I started to think as I read they were truly trying to inform us about a little known subject, but in the end I knew it was for money, that exact same thing that Jesus condemned at the Temple over the money exchangers disrespecting G-d. This book if written by Divinity Historians can be good, but not this one for obvious reasons."
2,A nice fantasy but plainly delusional.,"Although I found this book interesting I was continually affronted by the authors gullibility. He weaves an interesting fantasy and so I can imagine many people wanting to believe that the ideas he comes up with are truth. Unfortunately, his ability to jump to conclusions based upon here-say and rumor is his cedibilty's loss. I would not recommend this book because it is simply fantasy but is presented as fact."
1,A Load of B.S.,"This book is completely untrue, unreliable, and, above all, unbiblical.For one, Jesus Christ did begin to perform miracles until he was thirty years of age (when he began his ministry). Even then, he only healed to show others that he was the Christ. He did not spend his childhood healing little birdies with broken wings. That is an absurdity.And two, Jesus did not know Judas as a child. If he did, he was definitely not possessed by SATAN! Preposterous! Judas was possessed by Satan only for a brief time; when he partook of the Last Supper sacreligiously. John 13:27 of the New Testament states clearly, ""As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.""This book is a load. To take this book of lies as truth would be stupid."
5,"Mind-boggling stories, and Incredible research from Kimball","I have read this book several times, and still use it as a valuable resource. What Kimball has done in bringing this information together and bringing it to the public is quite humbling. I would recommend this book for everyone's library or coffee table."
5,Finally,"Finally, all the questions about Christ from infancy to 30 were answered. This author has a web site I cannot reach but would enjoy any more books from hidden manuscipts. It was easy reading and very revealing. Thouroughly enjoyed every minute."
3,If Art Bell likes it....It's got to have meat!,I heard of this book on Art Bell's radio program. I don't know if this guy is finding the truth or not but it sure makes for a great fireside chat! Read it for yourself!
4,Easy to read . Wonderful guidelines to conduct research.,"Kimball presented a ""tour through history"" for the modern man into the many stories not included in the current Bible. His easy to read research guide is meant to help anyone find out the truth for themselves. He does not attempt to influence your thinking in any way; but rather, provides you with the results of some of his many years of research and then sets you loose with suggestions and guidelines."
1,Author Watches Too Much Cable TV.,"Calling this man a Doctor is like calling his book facts in history. He misuses historical texts, mistranslates texts and copied fabricated biblical texts. A good TV Show but nothing of scholarly merit. The book is like the movie ""Contact"" good drama about myths and misinterpretations but makes us want to believe in something out of nothing. He is entertaining and promotes his own PR but so did Goebbles when he claimed Hitler was the answer to all of the world's problems. The book is good for an Art Bell's ""Lets Sell Snake Oil Freak Show but not much more."
3,Passable Read,"I really was not at all that impressed with the effort put into writing this book. The story was lacking, the first half was why to believe this book and the last quarter was anecdotes. I wish more focus and effort had been placed on the middle part as any one bit of information could have filled the book. I do recommend this book as it may help some readers, but the reason the details of Jesus as a youth were not included or inspired by the Prophets from the Holy Spirit to record it, was Jesus came to die and raise Himself from the dead, so that all who believe on Him will have eternal life too. THAT is what the reader should always keep in their heart as they read this book. Praise the Lord!!!!!!"
1,Horrific,"I couldn't even make it through 3 chapters before I had to stop reading this book, this has to be one of the worst books I've ever (started to) read. It reads like something a 14 year old would come up with. Horrible plot, horrible characterization and ridiculous dialog."
5,Do NOT pick-up hitchhikers!,"David Jacobs, the hardboiled true crime writer who gave usHellcats, Vixens, & Vicedolls: Women, Crime, and Kink of the FiftiesandKu Klux Klan America's First Terrorists Exposed (Shadow History of the United States), partner-ups with True Detective Magazine to round-up the usual suspects in this blood and octane fueled crime expose.Road Kill: From the Files of True Detective Magazine reads fast and furious like a getaway car racing away from a double murder!"
5,good & fast read,"If you like true crime & want all the information in a few pages you will like this book. It is full of short stories that start with the crime. Tells you about the victim, the cops on the job, how they find the killer, about the crime & the outcome.Really a good true crime book."
4,original.,"I've heard most of the songs on this CD. But the rest are bound to be just as good. Worth buying! Best thing about this cd is track 3, one of my favorites of David usher."
5,amazing,I got the cd as soon as it came out and have not stoped listening to it. It is amazing David's voice is relaxing and claming. The acuostic guitar is great and realy adds to the mood. He many not be the most know song writter or artists by in my mind he is one of the best
5,these really work during flu season,"these are absolutely terrific - if you start to take them at the first sign of symptoms they can defend you against getting sick - couldn't get them locally so had to go online, great product"
5,great starting point for aesop rock,"While it's only seven songs long, they are all better then most of the main stream rap out there. Aesop rock's flow is great and his references are genius."
5,Great Sounding,"So, I suspected that these headphones would be good...but oh my god are they good. I have them plugged into my computer at work and I am rocking out!! Bass response is amazing. Treble is amazing. The best part about these headphones is that my office mates cannot hear them at all. They have some good passive noise cancelation as well."
5,"Great headphones, great low Hz when you need it","I've owned these headphones for a long time. My wife bought them for me for Christmas one year. Who knew she could pick the perfect ones for me! They're the best headphones I own. They have a great low end that's perfect for using them on your keyboards when you want to hear that low Grand Piano note, or low string note. I also use them on my VS2480 recording studio. Surprisingly they are amazing when used for guitar! No grit! They're perfect. I've search eBay forever and bought many many speakers trying to get my guitar to sound as good as they do thru these headphones. They are especially good used with guitar modelers. I highly recommend them.Especially unique to these headphones is the replaceable (detachable) cable. Yeap, I've had so many accidents yanking them off my head (too many beers probably) that I've needed to replace the cable. Keep a spare on hand."
2,Good Show Bad Value For Volume 1,"I happen to like this show a lot. However doing the math, 22min per episode x 5 episodes = 110 min. This volume is over priced. 5 episodes is too few for 13.49. I hope this series will eventually air in Season Box Sets. Until then, I would suggest recording the series as it airs old and new episodes on TV."
1,Bad DVD Format,"This film may or may not be good, but I have not been able to get two different copies of this DVD to play on two different standard DVD players, and my PC also balks at playing the DVD. Something is wrong with the DVD encoding. I have to open up the DVD on my PC and play the individual MPEG files to watch the film."
2,Lesbians caught on security camera,"All the scenes in this DVD are off security cameras. Therefore the picture quality is very poor, and they do not get close in. There are 4 G on G scenes but they are all from a distance, so you can't really enjot it too much. The Solo performances are horrible. Womean are average, not models."
3,"Hey, friend","I was hoping to find inspirational sensational poems about friendship, but I was disappointed. I have to believe there's better sources out there, and there were a few gems, but overall a bit prosaic. Sorry, friend."
4,Great peek into what living with multiple (and unusual!) animals can be like,Anyone who has ever had a pet knows that living with them is not always a cotton candy fairytale! Ms. Mantle does an excellent job of sharing her experiences as a pack leader in an entertaining way. Her stories are easy to identify with. Thanks for showing me I'm normal!
4,A new look at living with pets,"In this humorous and touching book about living with a large assortment of pets, author Stacy Mantle had me chuckling out loud to myself more than once.The book is composed of small essay-like chapters that are an excellent way to relax and end a busy day with a smile on your face. One of my favorite chapters was ""Falling Into The Food Chain"", where Stacy happens to fall while vacuuming and cannot get up (this is not the funny part...yet). Her pets think that this is quite a fun game, and are seemingly amazed at how ""into"" the game she is as she crawls to the nearest telephone. What fun!This book makes a wonderful gift for yourself, for all of the pet lovers in your life, and for all of the people who don't know they are pet lovers... yet."
2,Unfortunate,"Although I am a huge Cher fan, I must admit that this movie does not do her justice. The script is poor and the acting is mediocre. Cher does a fine job but the material is weak."
3,Faithful,This is not one of the heard about Cher movies. But it is a good one. Funny in spots and makes you happy at the end to see how it turns out. If you are a Cher fan it is worth getting to add to your collection. I saw it originally in the movie theatre and was happy to see it out on dvd.
3,Works better as a play,"Based on a play by the guy who plays the hitman in this short movie, this doesn't have a lot of action, though it does have a few mildly entertaining plot twists. The movie format allows for a few flashbacks to be fleshed out. None of the characters are very sympathetic. Cher, in 1996 when this was made, had just had her lips plumped. Ryan O'Neill still looked less bloated than he was to become. I had to pause this at least half a dozen times and go do other things because I got bored by the tedium of the script. The end is total anticlimax. An average watch for an off night."
3,good to watch on a rainy day,"This is not a movie I would suggest for everyone, but good to watch on a lazy afternoon or something like that."
3,"It was okay,","It was an okay movie, but most parts came over kind of weird. And the chronology of the scenes were messed up. Or something.IT was really confusing to watch, and I was kind of disapointed. The acting was great, but the script or just the whole movie was just lacking something.And the ending for me just plain sucked. It was so plain and..I don't know, unsatisfying. Thw whole thing would have been better as a play. Which was what it started out as,right?"
3,Not bad - Chazz carries it,"This was better than I expected. Chazz Palminteri plays a hit man set to kill Cher, and who was sent by her husband, played by Ryan O'Neal. But then once Chazz starts to talk to her, they seem to have this snappy discourse. (He can't just kill her - he's waiting for a phone call from the husband.) This isn't more than a nice-looking play (great house in Harrison, NY), and it's not suspenseful at all, but Palminteri's charm carries it nicely."
4,Insight Guide Wales,"This seems to be a good guide; although a little old, it might not be too dated."
5,Speaker stands,"They exceeded my expectation.Very well made, functional, and adds to the decor in the family room. My wife also is pleased with my selection.Would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone in the market for supporting home theatre type speakers."
4,They do the job,"Solid construction considering they're only holding surround speakers. The little triangles that are supposed to hold the speakers in place came off quite easily within a day or so, but the stands are solid. The wire cover is a little annoying, but not that bad."
4,Very good but not perfect (yet),"These stands look and work great.Despite being very careful with the assembly (thanks to customers' reviews and comments) I still managed to get two hairline cracks where the legs attach to the base, but nothing serious or noticeable.The manufacturer provides spikes for carpet application, yet nothing is provided forwood and tile flooring which makes it impossible to run the speaker cables under the base. A $3.00 investment in furniture felt pads quickly solves the problem.As for the black plastic sleeve that conceals the speaker wire at the back of the legs, it performed very well during installation and was much easier to insert than I thought. I simply and gently bent it/formed it length wise a few times and it was a breeze to fit.I also would like to commend the manufacturer on the nice packaging as the positive experience with any product usually starts with opening the package."
3,Cracking,"Wish I read the reviews before assembly! I bought four for my surround system. The first one cracked on assembly. It's very noticeable as the MDF is much lighter than the black finish. I drilled out the holes to the diameter of the screw shank and to its depth. That worked well. Other than that, I'm pleased with these."
3,Cheap... but so is the price.,"As others said, these things split very easily. You have to be extra careful when screwing these together, or the wood will split. I had 3 of the 4 vertical pieces splinter just when driving in the screws. There are routes so you can run the speaker wires through to hide them, however they come out through the middle, which means unless you're using flat cabling, you need to route it outside of the vertical legs. I used industrial strength velcro to attach the speakers to the stands because I have a cat that will surely knock them off the stands. For those using wood floors like me, the wires also need to exit out of the vertical legs instead of the bottom, because otherwise it will teeter. For those with carpet, it includes 4 pegs per stand so you can have a little space underneath for the wiring. For less than $40, I am not complaining. But the wood is CHEAP. I'd say these are just average."
3,"Good utility, but fragile","These are reasonably priced among speaker stands, which is how I came to buy a pair. I think they're all a bit too spendy for what they are, actually, including these, but they seemed to be my best option at the low end of the price range.They're fine, even attractive, and seem to offer good utility. I've sat big Boston Acoustic HD8s on them before scaling down to Polk TSi100s and then to a pair of B&W; DM303s.Whatever material they're made of (my guess: compressed bran flakes) is waaaaaay brittle, however. When I assembled these, I missed a pre-drilled hole on one of the vertical pieces and drove a screw about 1/8"" into the material. The vertical piece cracked about 6"" straight down the side! They seemed sturdy enough after assembling them, and once I considered the hassle of sending these back, I decided I could live with the crack. Buyer beware.The carpet spikes are cheap plastic. Probably better than nothing, but only slightly."
3,Fix it !,"The fit and finish is very good. But the wobbeley stamped paper MDF is not. My fix: After assembly,remove dry wall screws,one at a time,and push Carpenter's glue down into screw holes using a paper clip, to get the glue ""deep."" Next, put ""L"" brackets with short screws and Gorilla glue at the bottom joints. Now you will have world class stands, and your 1 year old child will not be able to knock over your $ 400 dollar Polks. A great buy for ""do it your selfers"" and we ""Bush legacy"" poor boys."
1,"Be an informed buyer, not just a cheapskate.","First of all, know that these speaker stands are not wood. They are an engineered wood product, which in this case results in a ""wood"" that will almost certainly split even if great care is used when assembling. I've used MDF wood in the past which has been supurb. These are not. I never used the stands because they were so flimsy and unstable. I ordered a pair of Sanus metal stands (Sanus SF30B Black Pair 30"" Speaker Stands) instead and now have stable stands I can depend on and which are attractive enough to be proud of. The small difference in price is well worth spending if you want a product that will last forever and bring joy every day when you see them under your speakers."
2,Flimsy / poor construction materials,"The stands are packaged well and look good, but they are not designed to hold a speaker of any significant weight. I have a pair of these stands with Klipsch RB-81 II speakers (bookshelf speakers with an 8"" driver). The stands are definitely not stable with these speakers on them. If you or a pet bump into these stands with a large style bookshelf speaker, the stands will topple easily and your speaker will be on the floor. Also the partical board used for the wood is very soft and the screws can strip easy. If your speakers are small and the stands are in a location where they will not get tocuhed/bumped, then they may be ok for you. Otherwise, look to a stand more sturdy (amazon sells plenty that are more sturdy)."
3,"Inexpensive, but not very solid","They aren't bad stands and are a great deal for the price. However, they are not very solid and have little mass. This isn't good for sound quality. If you're looking for solid stands for your speakers that won't wobble or move when you're playing music, get metal stands that have some mass to them and not wood stands."
4,great stands,"These are great stands, but please follow the instructions when you put them together. If you use power tools there is a good chance you'll crack them. They should only be hand tightened, but not too tight.On the back side of the base of one of my stands it was slightly banged up, but it is not noticeable when they're assembled and in position so I didn't make a fuss about it.I'd recommend these to a friend. They're a great value for the price."
3,Sanus Basic 24,"Fine, basic, non-audiophile stands. The spikes are a joke, little and plastic, but the stands are good basic stands. I had two supports break during installation, so I called Sanus directly. They shipped new parts to my door via UPS within about a week."
4,good speaker stands for the price,"I bought these stands for about 40% off advertised price through Amazon. They were easy to set up. No problems there. They support my Klipsch SB-3's without a problem. The look is plain, and match the black matte on the speakers, which is what I was going for."
3,Not Great,"One stand was fine, the other's holes were misaligned so that, when assembled, the gap between the two front pieces is noticeably wider at the base. Also, on the same stand, one of the holes for the top plate was misaligned so that when I screwed into the pre-drilled holes, the wood (particle board) split. Had to leave that screw out completely. I can't recommend these speaker stands."
3,COULD BE 5 STARS,READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING AND THE ISSUE IS THE SPLITTING OF THE MATERIAL WHEN THE SCREWS ARE INSERTED. SOAPED THE SCREWS BEFORE INSERTING THEM AND IT STILL SPLIT BADLY. I FEEL THE ISSUE IS THE SCREW SIZE. IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN I WOULD SUBSTITUTE THE ENCLOSED SCREWS WITH A SMALLER SHEET ROCK SCREW. THIS WOULD LESSEN THE CHANCE OF SPLITTING AND STILL GIVE SUPPORT.THESE ARE NICE LOOKING STANDS THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY RESOLVED THE MDF MATERIAL FROM SPLITTING (THESE ARE NOT WOOD BUT MEDIUM FIBER BOARD).
4,Great Purchase!,"I bought these speakers stands a couple weeks ago, and they are great. Putting them together takes basically no time at all. They are sturdy and go great with my entertainment system. I think that anyone who is thinking about buying these speaker stands should do it! they are a great buy, and ship very fast."
3,Good price but needed work.,The online sales site lacked some dimensions I would have liked. The only dimension given was the height. The price was very reasonable compared to other similar products. The quality was not the greatest as some of the wood split on assembly and had to be repaired and painted. But all worked out in the end.
4,Great speaker stands for the price,"The Sanus BF-24B speaker stands work well and have kept my speakers off the floor for the better part of a year. They are easy to assemble and come with some little spikes that act as feat, keeping the stands securely in place in carpet. I have 2 rambunctious Rottweilers and a crazy mutt and I can't tell you how many times they have bumped into my right front speaker, but the stand has yet to tip, probably due to the previously mentioned spikes digging into the living room carpet.The base of the stand has a slightly porous surface that tends to hold dust making it difficult to clean and catching all the lint from your rags or paper towels. The rear piece is very flimsy and pops out easily.Over all it's a great product and goes well with out entertainment center."
2,difficult to assemble,"I found these stands very difficult to assemble. The match between the screws holding the top and bottom sections to the uprights were very hard to locate.i have done a fair amount of assemblies (IKEA, etc.) but these were by far the most difficult. In addition, 2 of the 4 upright pieces split both on top and bottom after being assembled."
1,Cracked when screws installed,"Started the screws into the pillars and cracks started forming. Once the screws were completely seated, the cracks ran completely through the pillar. Looked at the second stand and found a crack ready to split even before installing a screw. Returned these immediately and will not take another set."
4,Works as expected....but,"After opening the double-box of the shipment, the speaker stands were in excellent condition. During assembly, I did experience some very light splitting of the wood on the vertical pieces as others had indicated. However, by using a manual screwdriver and watching the amount of torque and speed applied I was able to successfully complete the assembly without any visible splits in the material. I rated this a 4 star on design because of the placements of the speaker wire management holes and their size. The bottom hole could be substantially larger allowing you to run your cables through with banana plugs on, however it was just large enough for the 16-gauge Monoprice speaker-wire I was utilizing. The hole on the top for the speaker-wire management is pointless, and like others I ran mine out of the back of the stand and looped the wire into my bookshelf speakers. I would purchase this product again, and did so by getting the 31"" version for my rear surrounds."
2,"These are not wood, title is misleading","These stands look really good, but I will have to either have amazon replace them or sanus send me new pillars since one pillar split during very careful assembly. Having read another review that talked about the pillars splitting I was especially careful to not over tighten the screws and one still split. The little feet are wonderful, the design looks amazing in my family room, but these are disposable speaker stands since the materials are not really good for their purpose. I would recommend spending a little more to get real wood or metal materials rather than these.Also, amazon shoud fix the product listing so it doesn't say wood."
1,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK","These speaker stands are pure junk. When assembling, the pillars split where the screws are screwed in. I called Sanus and they sent my replacement pillars. The replacements split at the screw holes in the same way when assembling. These are not wood, also, they are synthetic. Do not waste your time purchasing these stands. They should be recalled."
1,Cheap garbage.,"Save up some money and buy something better, either metal or real wood. These things are cheap, don't sit level on the little pegs, and they crack and fall apart very easily. I should have kept the box. STAY AWAY!"
3,Good......... but not the best!,"Many other reviews said to be careful when assembling, because the wood splits when screwing together. I tried to be easy as possible.........didn't matter.The stands are nice for the price but if you can afford, get solid wood or metal stands."
3,Great stands horrible feet,These stands are perfect except for the plastic feet. One of the plastic feet broke before I even had the speaker on the stand. It broke from slightly bumping the stand and it snapped. Aluminum or a better plastic would have been better. Overall I really enjoy the stands and they look great I just wish the feet were better quality. I'm worried about others snapping if someone moves them slightly on accident.
5,Functional and inexpensive,"I had no problems with these speaker stands. When driving the screws you must be certain that the legs are absolutely perpendicular to the top and base. If the legs are tilted or angled away from vertical the screws will split the wood. I used a bit of wood glue to strengthen the assembly. I used two strips of wide industrial strength Velcro to lock each speaker in place. You can find that in the craft isle of a certain large chain store starting with a W. These easily support Polk Monitor 40 speakers weighing approx. 15 lbs. They look decent also. The wiring is routed through the bottom, up the inside of the legs and out at the top of the rear of the legs. There is a hole for wiring in the center of the top plate, but the speaker couldn't possibly sit flat on top of the wires. Excellent value for the price paid."
1,Look Elsewhere!!,"I order two sets of these stands for my front and rear bookshelf speakers in my home theater. I read the reviews here and all sounded good. I even contacted the speaker manufacturer, HSU Research, who told me these were the very stands they use in their demo room. The price was right so I ordered up. When they arrived I removed them from the box and began to assemble them. By the time I got the fourth screw in I called it quits. All the screw holes were pre-drilled and I went very slowly as not to over tighten. EVERY joint split from the assembly screws. Not just one which could be a fluke. Every piece split. These stands are something my wife and I would call ""first apartment"" quality. If your broke and don't care, they'll do. Probably won't last long as they are starting off split. If you want a quality stand, go with something else. We ended up with the VTI DF series metal stands."
3,"Yup, you get what you pay for!","Yup, I got hairline Wood Splits despite my extra effort as a result of reading these reviews...dang! However, they are manageable (if disconcerting) and the stands are still quite functional.I used white glue to better anchor the screws, and followed the excellent suggestion to apply a couple coats of Polyurathane to the somewhat unsmooth/powder coated surface.So... bottom line... an extra hour or so of effort... the cost of the paint...if ""time is money,"" all else being equal, I could have justified spending a few more bucks... I'm just sayin'."
2,"I expected cheap, but not this cheap","These stands were pretty awful. I've had Walmart furniture that was a higher quality then these. I only constructed one of the two stands before deciding that I needed to send them back for a refund.When put together I ran into a slew of problems... The predrilled holes are not large enough to keep the wood from splitting when the screws are screwed in. So two of the holes caused a split in the front, exposing the white compressed wood just below the black paint. The screws don't screw flush into the wood on the top either, leaving them slightly exposed. The stand provides rubber feet for the bottom of your speakers, but the feet are so thin that the speakers end up sitting on the uneven screws that are slightly sticking out instead.All around the stand is incredibly low quality and unstable. I'd be afraid of kids or pets or anything knocking over my speakers anytime they walked near these stands."
2,Garbage,I've had no end of trouble with this company and that is not even mentioning the product. Garbage... You are must better off spending a bit more for quality. I had to JB Weld them to their platforms after one week. Please be smart when dealing with this company. They will not help you at all.Thanks for you precious time
2,"Sanus 24B Spkr. Stands that were sent to me, NOT worth the money!","The stands are o.k. They do the job. You get what you pay for, Right? I had to run out & buy some of that rubber material that is used to stop rugs from slipping. I cut out (2) 5"" squares, so my speakers don't slide around on the stand. Also, these stands don't really hide the spkr. wire. I don't have a router to make the holes larger; you see, I use Monster wire & it is TOO thick for the wire to go through the hole. So I live with looking at the wire, no big deal. Just one more thing; (To me was Much More Important!)the company these spkr. stands came from,(the name evades me right now) The box was a ""RE-PACK"", it looked like it had been beat up & the tell tale packing tape holding the box together, But I didn't feel like going through the trouble of writing & shipping for an RA... At the time I received them, my Father was Dying & my mind wasn't really on the stands."
4,"Speakers that will now ""stand"" the test of time","Delivered on time, and setup was easy. While bottom carpet spikes were a bit difficult to attach, the unit appears sound and sturdy."
4,Not Bad,"These speaker stands are a little bit flimsy, but they look great and do a good job for bookshelf size speakers. On one of them, the wood split a little bit when I screwed it together, but it is not too noticable. On the same one, one of the plastic spikes that helps steady it on the carpet broke off. These spikes are not really needed though. For the price it is a good deal."
4,"Basic stand, looks good",These are real good value stands. I have slightly heavier than recommended speakers on them and they are solid enough for me. Cable holes dont really allow for larger base speakers as the speaker covers the hole. Assembles easily. Spikes are plastic and not particularly strong but fair for this level of product. Makes a real improvement to sound quality and limits bass transfer through the floor so I'm happy with these.
4,Very sturdy design and perfect for my Onkyo speakers!,"I have tall Onkyo speakers out of a package and is very heavy. This product holds that product up very well. The base is weighted so there is no swaying. The only complaint I have is the stubs the product comes with for ""added"" stability. It doesn't push through in my carpet which is fairly standard carpeting. I don't use them and still have great stability for my heavy front Onkyo speakers. I believe it also came with rubber stoppers to stick to each corner of the bottom of the speaker to add stability to the speaker too. Great product!"
1,Poor design,"First I receive the item without the accessories, so I can't put it together. Wrote to Vanns, got no reply. Requested a return though Amazon...Amazon replies, but Vanns does not.Ok...so I write to Sanus...I got a reply and they shipped out the parts. Still took the better part of a week to get the accessories.Put the unit together. Oops. the long pieces that connect the base to the top platform are split while inserting the long screws. Either the screws supplied are too long or they are too fat. While the synthetic material that these stands are made of does look nice, it is obviously not able to withstand the screws that are supplied with these stands.The spikes won't fit easily within the holes at the underside of the bases.Sadly, this is just a poorly implemented product."
4,Great stands,Easy to put together. Price is excellent. They look good. Took a little long to arrive. Speaker wires not visible. I like that.
4,Must be a manufacturing refresh ...,"... because I had zero problem with the threat of splitting the uprights while using the stock screws. Just basic precaution in keeping the pieces straight while I tightened them in sequence. The speaker wire holes were also not an issue, my phillips head screwdriver would easily pass through and I can't imagine an 0-0 speaker wire.Don't try to drive the plastic carpet pegs into the bases, though ... you WILL split the MDF trying to drive those fat pegs home. Minus one star for the lack of a wire groove under the flat base, since I threw out the pegs I will just use thick cabinet felts on my hardwood floors and that should give plenty of room to thread 18g underneath without rocking.Good, solid, cheap. My kinda stuff."
3,Good Enough,"I bought these stands for large bookshelf speakers that I purchased. The quality of these stands is not great. I had the same problem that other reviewers have mentioned about the wood splitting when tightening the screws during assembly. Not a big deal, as it's not really noticeable and the stands look decent, but if you're looking for high quality stands look elsewhere.With that being said, quality issues aside, they hold my bookshelf speakers fine and that is what I bought them for."
1,Worst product I have bought on amazon,"I saw the high rating and it looked like a perfect fit for my speakers. I was excited when I received the item promptly. However, both stands completely split despite being super careful assembly and following the included instructions. The stands are completely useless. This is the worst product I have ever bought from Amazon.Another was that it arrived in the original packaging, without any protection. This packaging came wet and damaged. Don't bother ording it, a cardboard cutout would have held up better. Didn't even get to use it."
2,Very cheap build quality,"The wood was cracking and splitting as I tried to assemble these. Seem to be very cheap quality and the assembly is shotty. I learned from my mistakes on the first one, and was very very careful in assembling the second one, which went a little better. All-in-all, not a sturdy speaker stand at all. I have 2 Sony bookshelf speakers sitting on them, and I will be careful to never bump them or move them around too much! Do yourself a favor and go with the Vantage Point speaker stands instead. The quality and sturdiness is not even comparable."
3,Decent stands at a decent price.,"These are not shot-filled or granite stands, but they are pretty decent and a great deal for the price. I needed a temporary solution while I build out my home theater, and these fit the bill nicely.I am not using the carpet spikes since I have hardwood floors, but the stands are doing just fine and not passing much vibe to the floors. The little speaker isolation pads are OK and Sanus could've offered shorter version of their carpet spikes for another buck or two."
4,Sanus systems BF-24B,"good product, they go well with my black NHT SB-3's. They come very well wrapped in protecctive packaging with an instruction manual that is decent. The only problem I had was lining up the holes - I missed the first time on one of the legs and it cracked a little so be careful on that !"
4,Very Nice,"Quite a nice set for the price. Quality seems good and packaging is top notch with each item being securely wrapped in foam. Only issue I have is that the bottom base is a little large. Hardly an issue for a large room, but it could take away from your decor slightly, especially with a small room. Would buy again though, and they look good too!"
3,does the job,"This pair of stands work as advertised to lift bookshelf speakers 24 inches off the ground achieving the relative height of a tower speaker. Costs much less than competing stands. They are however made of cheap material if you can about that kind of stuff. I just assembled them, put my speakers on them, and forgot about it. Haven't run into any problems. Other reviews posted here are accurate in their description of this product and it's relative strengths and shortcomings."
3,Not a very good product,It is good looking - but while assembling it - it had cracks - just like some of the reviews said earlier. I was very very careful - but still could not help the cracks.A good temp solution - not sure how long this will last. Sound quality of my speakers has held up - so no problems with that.
