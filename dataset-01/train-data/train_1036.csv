5,Collapsible garment rack,"Perfect for my purpose. Large and sturdy. Unfortunately, when it arrived I had a problem. It was collapsed in such a way that it would not open unless taken apart. This was a problem for there was no diagram or directions included and I had no idea what to do. I would have sent it back but the box it came in had so much tape on in that it had to be ripped open. It looked like it was quickly and incorrected repacked. I wrote the company and they said they do not send seconds. It sure looked like they did. But, they did send me the diagram that should have been included and I was able to fix.It was extremely frustrating and disappointing expecially when I purchased for the ease of using. I have not yet had to collapse it and hope that will not be a problem.Bottom line....product is excellent, shipping awful!"
5,Better than expected!,"having bought something like this before, I wasn't expecting too much. So, to my surprise, this is an amazing unit - perfect for the reason that I bought it and more! Thanks!"
5,Sturdy,This product is greatness aisle it holds a lot of cloths and can handle weighted items. Then it can fold down to 6 inches or so for transport. Really convenient.
5,Great product!,"A strong, durable rack that has great balance! Extremely easy to assemble! No tools necessary. This product is worth the cost."
5,Works perfectly for what I needed,I don't have much closet space and was looking for something that would hold the weight of all my clothes I wanted on hangers. This does the job perfectly and I may even buy another one. I put it together in less than half an hour. If I could add one thing it would be some sort of cover so I could store seasonal clothes.
2,P.O.S....,"Wow....that's all I have to say. After seeing all of the reviews I really wish I would have checked them out before buying this. I just received it yesterday and opened it this morning to discover that, like others, I must completely take it apart before I can use it. It's folded down in such a way that it will not open at all due to the way they put it together. The packaging was ridiculous and there are no instructions included. 2 of the bolts were rolling around in the box and this is completely unusable for the event I need it for at 7am tomorrow. Not impressed in the slightest..."
3,"Wobbles but doen""t Fall Down","The rack arrived within the specified time.No instructions with item.4 Set screws to keep it in the collapsed position.Turned set screws into tube to make verticals erect.Once the adjustable verticles were inserted and the upper rails were connected,there was no further tightening that could be done.Once loaded with coats and clothing it was hard to move around due to itbeing that loose."
5,Easy to move and easy to put together,"These racks are absolutely great for any business use. I use them to display my ribbons, Practically Ribbons. You can see this at practicallyribbons.com A real bonus was that the rack, once it is set up, can double as a dolly for all of my craft show equipment. I was thrilled when I realized that. I set it up at the car and roll it all in..one trip in and one trip out."
2,garment racks,These are very large - so make sure the space you have will accommodate them. Very sturdy though.
2,Poor Quality for Freud,"I bought my set a few years ago contempalting doing Dovetail joints. I just pulled it out to use with my PorterCable 1501 router. It would not fit my base plate. Fortunately I found my old porter-cable router that has a base fixed in one place excepted the guides. I tried the 3/8"" guide and found it to be off-center or out of round. It would not fit in the router base. Probably had it to long to get it exchanged. I've bought a lot of other Freud products and have been pleased, but this one surprized me."
2,Poor quality control VERY suprised given Freuds reputation,"Ordered and received FT2020 template guide very quickly. Much to my dismay, the Template guide adaptor did not have the holes drilled. Ruined plans for weekend project. No customer service on weekend guess I'll wait until Monday."
2,missing parts and incomplete item,I received my Freud 2020 template guide incomplete. It was missing a 7/16 guide and the template guide adaptor was not drilled out with 4 holes. I called toolcrib and told them about this problem and they said they would mail the correct items to me. I received only the 7/16 inch guide. I called again and they said they would correct the problem. It seems someone needs to have a better system of quality control prior to shipping. Hoping they get it right this time.
2,Freud needs customer focus,"I like my Freud router, but I've ruined my 1/4"" template guide. I can't find them anywhere on their site. Their search engine is horrible. I don't believe they offer individual guides, but that remains to be seen. The worst problem is the main part doesn't fit flat in the router. I have to shim it on one side. Poor fit."
2,Did Not Fit my Router - FT1700VCE,"The bushings appear to be good quality, but the adapter plate absolutely would not fit on my router base. I have a Freud FT1700VCE (listed as being compatible) and I tried the plate on both my fixed and plunge router bases with no luck. (I even dug out my manual to make sure that I was trying to install it correctly.) It looks like they machined the plate just a bit to big to fit in the base. I probably could have ground down the outer rim of the adapter a bit, but I would have expected more from Freud. Returned."
5,Funk yourself!,"One of the funkiest acid jazz CD's I've ever heard. Plenty of itching to keep you scratching. It will trap you in its grooves and catapult you from your seat. Plenty of sax and Hammond B-3 solos, and some flute (nice touch!). Get all the albums by Sugarman 3 if you are into acid jazz; pure Cane Sugar is as good."
5,Simply awesome,"This band is the best 70's original funk band of the 90's and 2000's...and this album in particular features one of my favorite songs as well, Funk so and so. Great musicians playing great music. Can only recommend."
1,I Feel cheated on postage,"I paid $15.80 postage and it took over 5 weeks for the book to arrive. It is not a large book, it's only a small paperback. Similar books have arrived in 5 days. The book has a lot of highlighting and undermarkings throughout. So I am very disappointed."
3,"Nice work, bad sonics","This is a nice ballet by Gliere, the creator of the Bronze Horseman Suite and the Il'ya Murometz symphony (No. 3, Op. 42). I got this CD a few years ago and I've listened to it many times. It is the only complete Red Poppy available on CD that I know of. To my untrained but musical ears, the orchestra plays out of tune a number of times, and like the previous reviewer said, the sound is deep, as if the microphones are far from the orchestra or the stage is creating slight echo, so the CD is just ok for casual listening. Better sounding highlights from this ballet are available on the market, but for the full ballet, this is unfortunately it!"
5,The Lost Shearing Albumn,"To the reviewer who asked about the George Shearing albumn with Dakota Staton. It was released in 1958 and was titled, ""IN THE NIGHT"". The only cut I have ever heard is the absolutely wonderful ""I Hear Music"" which is a selection on her ""SPOTLIGHT ON DAKOTA STATON"" which is available on CD. Apparently the Shearing albumn is not available on CD ALTHOUGH I URGE CAPITOL TO DO SO!! There are hundreds of Dakota Staton fans waiting for that CD. I will even consider the purchase of the 33 if anyone out there has a clean copy."
5,Found It At Last!,"I owned ""The Late, Late Show way back in the 1950""s. Miss Staton was my favorite blues singer. This album is as fresh and lively as in the 50's! It is timeless!! I moved away from NY and left all my albums behind. I could kick myself! I couldn't remember the titles but CDNOW was fabulous! I am also looking for Dakota Staton and George Shearing album in CD format. Could anybody tell me where to find it or at least, the title of it. It was also one of my favorites!The cover had a grand piano and Miss Staton standing. I think. Cover was very classy."
5,A reminder of a great singer,"I fell in love with [and to the sound of] Dakota Staton's singing when I was a teenager, back in the 50s. She was and is one of the freshest stylists in the pop-jazz category. I'd long ago lost those old LPs that I nearly wore out back then, but one day, while listening to the radio on a road trip, I accidentally caught Dakota singing ""The Late, Late Show"" and I was smitten all over again. I, of course, looked her up online and found out that Amazon.com, of course, had the CDs available. I am so happy to have Dakota singing to me again - and she's as fresh and vibrant as ever!"
5,Life in Songs,I never tire of listening to George. I play it over and over. Day after day.It is as fresh today as it was the day it was first recorded
1,Carpenter,"This blade shattered as I was installing it the first time. I replaced it, at about three times what it's worth, and found that it dulled quickly when cutting wood."
2,Fein blade,Replacement for the one I broke. Happens whenever I borrow the neighbor's tools. I rate it low based on price alone as it costs as much as a comparable tool with blades from Dremel.
3,Fein sawblade,"The tool is versatile, but the cost of the sawblades is ridiculous. Can some other supplier get into this market and provide some price competition?"
2,Something tougher,"I love my Fein, but I would love it even more if it could cut metal. I had to use three of these blades to get a rusted bolt off the back of a sail boat. I can only hope that someone will come up with a better blade."
2,Brittle,"While this blade's cut was super accurate, I was disappointed that after only using it one time the inner diameter teeth that connect to the Fein tool crumbled. There's still a few left so it's usable (just have to be careful). And this blade is expensive too."
3,Amazing surprise,I really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and a very pleasant surprise. I have watched it twice so far. Interesting plot twists and the story moves along quickly.
1,What a Cheesy Movie,"Don't let the cover art or the synopsis fool you. Cheesy movie. Appears to have been done with a handheld personal video cam. The acting was awful, dialogue bad, and the storyline absurd. Don't wast your money on this."
2,Unsolved Suburbia!,"I thought this movie was going to be better...by the cover I saw but it turned out to be rather dull. There's not much plot to it...a few teens messing around with each other and life. I watched it all because I paid for it...but if I knew it would be this dull...I would have passed on it. I had read other so-so reviews...took a chance...and now I agree with the unfavorable reviews I read. Off to the next yard sale with this CD...maybe, if I'm lucky, I'll be able to get a buck for it...if not...it'll be a free-be!"
2,Almost As Bad As People Say It Is,"Unsolved Suburbia is a gay noir drama. The cast is comprised of mostly teen characters. And boy, is it a mess! There is some humor (but not enough), and some good nudity (but again not enough). However, that's where the positives stop. Everything else, from the acting, to the pacing, to the direction is pretty bad. And the plot goes back and forth, and it makes things really confusing. How Unsolved Suburbia got released is a mystery that is and will always be ""Unsolved"". 2 stars out of 5 for the nudity and cute guys."
5,A Complete Nutter for Clunesism Movies,"Wonderful, Wonderful Martin Clunes shows his talent again and again with this silly film about a 'Cloutie' of which one has never heard of in Australia but the likelihood of it being a Clunes Classic is guaranteed. I now have the complete series of Doc Martin and Doc Banford and this little beaut just puts icing on the cake. If you don't get one, you are not a Clunes Fan (or Nutter) like me. I just hope I never get sick in Cornwall! Ha! Ha!"
2,Silly,"I saw this after watching much of the series (the character is taken a different way there) and the first movie (again, not like the eventual t.v. series) and liking both. I also later saw his character in ""Saving Grace,"" an amusing term. This movie however was silly and overall rather disappointing. It is akin to the double episode of Doc Martin actually -- you want to like it because you like the characters (or main character), but it is actually pretty lame. Sorry."
5,A Brilliant atmosphere; boundless of genre specifics,"I find most albums of this sort to be far too similar in the long run; the mood is a dark ambiance, some samples, and then fade. Rather than the usual formula of industrial/ambient instrumental music, this album borders on noise, experimenting with soft electronics that bring a heavy tone, that often shift into new, cohesive layers.Take for instance the title track, which begins with some cathedral-esque chanting which gives way to distorted spoken word and some heavy synths; or the first track that starts with some sort of synthetic instrument, followed by what sounds like chimes (maybe?) echoing and mutating.The whole atmosphere is haunting, without the factors of predictability thrown in. It's obvious to me, despite how relatively unknown this group is, that they deserve much more credit than they achieved."
4,A Sound Overview of a Very Current and Relevant Field,"This is a good book, but it can be a dense read. Barbour introduces four views as to whether science and religion are ultimately compatible. (These four views are much similar to the categories introduced by John Haught's book ""Religion and Science"") Barbour treats the subject with an objective, and serious mind. While he is certainly favorable to religion, science is also extremely important to him. Readers will no doubt be enriched by his knowledge of this very lively and relevant topic."
1,Not very useful,"I did not find this book to be very useful. It is essentially a survey of the various viewpoints on Religion vs. Science. It certainly won't help anyone looking for reasons to lend credence to religion. All it accomplishes is showing that the existence of God is not disproven by Science; doesn't come close to showing that God exists. There was no new science, and no new theology. If you already are a believer, then perhaps that lends some comfort, but a skeptic won't be moved an inch."
2,Is there a physicist in the house?,Plain and simple. There is some thought-provoking points made in this book. But there are some difficulties for the average reader to comprehend.
4,Hydrogen Peroxide.... Good Stuff,The book had lots of facinating info in it... I am hoping ot begin the treatment in a week or so and have some results. My main focus is to be able to breath better as I have Asthma. We will see what transpires and hope that it helps me out.... Good book.. good information...
4,Hydrogen Peroxide: Medical Miracle,It describes the benefit of using hydrogen peroxide for various conditions. Oxidative damage of using it is not discussed enough.
3,Health Book,Presents convincing reasons why peroxide could help many diseases. Hard to find Dr that will administer IV hydrogen peroxide therapy.
1,"H2O2 OK for the outside, bad for the inside","H2O2 has some proven topical uses but inside our bodies it is produced as a by product, and an enzyme, hydrogen peroxidase, breaks it down the instant it is produced. It is a strong oxidizing agent and kills good cells along w/ bad cells, i.e. bacteria. It can delay uninfected wound healing if used routinely. If it were not for hydrogen peroxidases breaking down the H2O2 the moment it got insidee our bodies it would kill you."
4,Don't Drink This Stuff,"The book is very good reading and hydrogen peroxide is wonderful. However, the type the book discusses is not the liquid kind you purchase in the drug store. Don't drink typical hydrogen peroxide you normally see; most authorities agree this isn't good for you. I'm never going to do what the book recommends, so, while the reading is interesting, it is of limited value."
1,Pseudoscience,"This is yet another example of pseudoscience presenting as fact things that just can't be shown. Hydrogen peroxide, or free oxygen radicals, are intracellular poisons. If you possess a mutation preventing its enzymatic degredation, you DIE. Free radicals have been linked to all sorts of things, from aging, to the DNA damage that causes cancer.If you want to try H2O2 therapy, be my guest, but other than its usage as a cleaning agent for cuts and abrasians (for which I've used it often myself), it's magical medicinal properties are somewhat nonexistent. Unless, of course, you're considering the often documented placebo affect, which can be quite significant. I know this review is gonna get lots of negative votes, but so be it. Dr. Douglass is laughing all the way to the bank, and it's your money he's holding."
3,I Liked it,"I liked it and for those interested in the subject. Go get a copy of Ed McCabe's book, Flood Your Body with Oxygen. This is another book for the health library. I could not put it down."
3,Hydrogen Peroxide,"After reading the book by William Campbell Douglas, I'm still not sure whether I should use hydrogen peroxide by taking it orally. Dr. Douglas can't tell you to use it without becoming libel. He does give you names of Doctors who practice alternative medicene and tells of the wonderous cures by injecting the patient with hydrogen peroxide. He also warns of using hydrogen peroxide orally and the dangers of doing so. If you have a health condition that warrants taking a chance, then he provides some guidelines for mixing and drinking hydrogen peroxide to provide your body with more oxygen but he doesn't advise doing doing this although a lot of his friends do take it orally. If this is confusing, then, the book is too."
4,Satisfied,This is the second book I ordered for a friend of minewho saw an ad in a magazine. She is truly enjoying thisbook. Thanks seller for fast delivery and the book was in greatshape.
3,Hydrogen Peroxide: Medical Miracle,"This book was enlightening for the Medical Professional, but not for the everyday person that is more interested to use a known product such as Hydrogen Peroxide on their own without a doctor or hospital visit in order to use it for health reasons. It did not go into detail for the Self Help person to be able to use it, without a Professional Doctor's order, which would be very hard to request from one that would not be current on this product."
5,Fascinating discoveries on the benefits of oxygen therapy,The medical benefits associated with using hydrogen peroxide and other oxygen therapies are amazing. I recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their health and longevity. Many organizations have worked hard to keep the practices found within this book a secret due to the fact that it is more financially beneficial for them to keep people in poor health. It is worth anyone's time to read this book!
4,Great Advice,This book is very informative about hydrogen peroxide and all its benefits. I only wish there was more about taking it orally vs. being treated intravenously especially for food allergies.
3,Another too much and too little guide book.,"As is usual with books purporting to enlighten you on the use of software, this book covers a great many subjects. The problem is, there is not enough depth on any of the subjects to help much if you are already a user of the program. If you have a detailed question, the likelihood is you will not find the exact subject addressed or if it is, the coverage is perfunctory. For example, the material on Gantt charts is less detailed than you will find in the help menu, so why bother with the book? If you have advanced far enough on your own to ask this type of question, chances are you won't find the answer either place.On the other hand, if you are the type who is reluctant to just dive into a program and start figuring out how to use it on your own and want a guide, the sheer volume of material in this book will impede rather than help."
5,Visio 2003 Bible,"As an application training specialist, I'm always looking for books I can recommend to my students, and this is definitely one of them. This book offers a great one-stop resource for all things Visio!"
2,Fair-So many tunes don't really belong on here!,"OK, so far I am the first(and perhaps only)one to review this BBQ collection of soul/r&b tunes. Luckily I borrowed this collection from a co-worker; I am glad I didn't actually have to pay for it. I've put together better collections of fun tunes for picnics, barbecues, hanging at the beach parties, etc. than Rhino did with this boxed set. The karaoke tunes alone shouldn't be on here-what were the folks at Rhino thinking when they slapped together this haphazard collection? Don't get me wrong, I love Rhino, thanks to them at least half of my sizeable music collection consists of stuff put out by them. Skip this one no matter what, just dig out your favorite party tunes & your guests will have a terrific time."
4,How ever you view it Robert Goddard is a great story teller,"Most, not all of Robert Goddard's books are forgettable, however they are great attention holders and and escapes from the present."
3,Pretty good,"This novel is of the Jane Austen genre, but not as clever and far more wordy. And it is a mystery, which adds its own twist. I rarely give up on a book and did not intend to stop 3/4 of the way through, but lost interest and picked up another book. I may go back and finish it if I don't have anything else to read."
1,NOT John Carpenter,It's bad enough that they put John Carpenter's name in the title of this CD but Amazon should not have it listed as BY John Carpenter when it is clearly not. It is his music but butchered by some hacks in a garage (or cave) somewhere in some third world country with sporadic electricity and no running water. That's what it sounds like anyway. It should be listed as by the Splash Band where i'm sure it would sell millions of copies to their fans (you know who you are.) Simply awful!
5,Garnet Mimms and the Enchanters,"I learned at an early age, that for every artist that hits the top, there are 100's, maybe 1000's, that should have but didn't. Garnet Mimms and the Enchanters is surely in the 'should have' group. the songs are good, the vocals are classic. but they never made it to the recognition they should have had...the 'instant recognition' when their songs come on. make sure you have this one."
5,Quality Sound,"This product has superior sound quality, especiallly for this type of unit. The reception is very good, as well. Overall, I am completely satisfied with this product."
3,Predictable at best,While the writing and detail of the this book where good. The story line was pretty predicatble. Half way through (or less) you knew where this story was going to end up. Still it was charming none the less.
3,love/hate continues,"This product and all its attachments are great examples of the creativity of German Craftsmen. They all do what they are intended to do, BUT they don't last. The quality of the blades and other accessories belie the above statement.I have been using these tools for over 3 years, and every time I do ,I say a prayer that someone/ anyone will improve on the quality! Maybe Festool will. They seem to get it and are building products anyone will be proud to own!"
5,"High price, unique capabilities","All the reviews of this and similar Fein blades are true; they cost a lot and they are fragile and easy to break. I am now faced with the prospect of replacing some of my broken and dull blades and I am willing to pay the price because I must. I have invested over a thousand dollars in blades and sandpaper for the Multimaster and the capabilities that having this kit gives me are too numerous to mention. My advice is to use this particular blade as a last resort, those few instances when no other method can perform the task without risk of peripheral damage to the valuable stuff that we tradesmen and tradeswomen have to cut into. Fein blades are like auto insurance; they are an expensive burden when you don't need them but when you do, you will be very glad that you have them."
2,"Beware, this as fragile as a potatoe chip","I bought this blade to replace the one that came with the kit. When I tried to install it the blade must have been just a little off center. As soon as I put pressure on it, the blade shattered into a dozen pieces. I haven't used the new one yet, I am afraid of breaking it too."
3,Where is Makita when you need them?,I love using this tool but for 3 things:Brittle blade - my first one shattered when the tool it was mounted to hit the concrete floor.Breath taking accessory prices.The blade lock lever is too stiff for my small hands - it will snap shut breaking fingernails.
3,FioreBuilt and Fein TOOL blades,"OK. I agree, these blades don't last for squat and they are absolutely over priced. I think Fein is really setting itself up for someone else to take their market share. Our company uses the heck out of this tool and gives me good reason to look for a cheaper better alternative. Great tool though, it's saved me on a lot of things."
3,Average results but pricey,This proprietary saw blade works well but will wear quickly when using it on laminate flooring material due to the hardness of the material. I found the tool and blade very easy to use but was disappointed when the blade began to wear down quickly on hardened wood compressed laminate flooring. Blade does work well when making the cut outs for the floor duct registers in laminate flooring. Fein makes a well built product but the price of these blades are what you expect to pay for diamond saw blades.
1,"cheap, broke while using the blade","cheap, broke while using the blade. The fien power tool is a five star, most the blades are 3 star, this blade is a 1 star, so thin it broke while in use. There are many other style of blades to pick from."
5,Product exactly as described.,good quality. Arrived packaged well to avoid transit damage. It fits my 30-year old FEIN sander with the use of an adapter.
3,Shrouded in darkness,"Jarring stringed contemplation from this devout Russian composer often crosses the line from sublime into meandering, especially if one does not fully invest into the subtleties of these complex, though minimal, brooding chamber works. Even when one does, it seems that too often the overriding melodic theme prevalent reverts to ""black noise"". This compilation helps give a decent overview of the little known artist, ranging epic single constructs, briefer experimental notations, and more complete movements. Overall, I could have done with more light and less dark, as far as Gubaidulina's compositional technique is concerned, but around a default haze of gray, resides some fascinating bridges towards to the skies."
5,good series,"This was an interesting series. It was neat seeing the world through the eyes of a farm boy and watching him grow up. If you like Christian novels, this is worth reading."
3,Mixed feelings on this one...,"Mixed feelings on this CD, but tracks 1, 5, 6, and 8 are classic UTOPIA...1. The Road To Utopia -good2. You Make Me Crazy - skip3. Second Nature - skip4. Set Me Free - skip5. Caravan - great song6. Last Of The New Wave Riders - great song7. Shot In The Dark - skip8. The Very Last Time - great song9. Love Alone - skip10. Rock Love- skip"
5,An exemplary showcase of Todd and the boys,"I love this album as much today as I did when I received my first vinyl edition in 1980, before I realized what a masterpiece I had. The musical variety clearly demonstrates why Todd is such a sought after production consultant to so many other artists, and has an almost cult-like following of fans. Some might think that this collection illustrates why Todd has not had all the commercial success he so richly deserves, because it crosses and even pulls together different genres without a consistent style. On the contrary, his ability to appeal to fans of different music without compromising his artistic creativity in the name of commercialism is commendable. If you are looking for technical production that was innovative for the era, catchy tunes and lyrics as well as some that will make you think if you listen carefully, and a general album that has something for everyone, I highly recommend Adventures in Utopia."
4,UTOPIA AT ITS MOST ACCESSIBLE,"Probably the best melding of the ""progressive rock"" style of Utopia and the ""power pop"" style of Utopia. All the songs are power pop accessible but retain the sharp musicianship of previous progressive Utopian epics. Standouts are the up-tempo ""Road to Utopia"", the guitar/synthesizer duelings of ""Caravan"", the out and out metal ravings of ""Last of the New Wave Riders"" and the Boston-sounding ""The Very Last Time."" Also contains some send-ups of 'punk' with ""You Make Me Crazy"" and 'disco' with ""Rock Love."""
3,Only for quote fanatics,"This is more of a story about quotes, misattributions, and misremembered sayings than a complition of quotations. If you are a big quote nut and enjoy knowing the story behind the quotation, you must buy this. If you enjoy browsing a more traditional compilation on quotes, don't. Quotations are arranged by author and indexed by key word. One nice feature: if the source of the quotation is known, it is cited."
4,Timex Ironman,"When I ordered the Timex Ironman there were only two reviews -both of which were very negative, but I ordered despite that because comparable GPS watches were much more expensive. I have had no problems with either the watch or the GPS. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that you need the instruction book to use all of the features of the system. It is not user friendly, but when instructions are followed, it works as promised."
2,AKA 'My Trip To Branson with Paul Tibbets',"I don't know why I even read beyond the first couple of chapters; beyond that, it's just a travelog of Greene's trip to Branson with the three surviving crew members of the Enola Gay. Heroes, yes, but beyond that, pretty ordinary, and really not that interesting. At least, that's how the author portrays them. If I wanted to know about Branson, I'd go there, don't need to read a book about it."
2,Not what I expected,"I am afraid I really could not suggest this book to anyone above the age of 40 who knew their father. I read this book looking for some insight into the bombing of Hiroshima and what Bob Greene discovered about his father by talking with Tibbets. I was disappointed because it seems that Bob went into this not knowing anything about WW2 or the military. Unfortunately it also seems that he and his father never really talked at all, so he had to go to a stranger to find out what his father was like. That is sad. He brings this book off lauding Tibbets for the great hero he was. I don't mean to demean what Tibbets did. He was a hero. But if you read between the lines of his,(Bob's), fathers reminices you begin to realize that he was probably a real hero also. If you are looking for a book that tells it like it was and gives some insight to how people felt back during the war read ""Flags of Our Fathers""."
1,All hail a Mass Murderer,"Don't waste your money on a book that glorifies on of the greatest mass murderers in the history of the world. What is heroic about fliying over a city and dropping an atomic bomb, on defenseless civilians. According to this type of logic Hitler, Stalin, and Reagan (responsible for the carnage of the 80's against the people of central and south America) , were also heroes. This is simply a case of mindless slaughter, and dispect for life. Why not read John Hersey's Hiroshima, or Masuji Ibuse's Black Rain if you want to see the real results of Tibbet's cowardly act of moral blindness."
5,As The Story Should Be Told,This book describes the attitudes of the people of the United States and their sense of duty during WWII. The book describes some of the hardships of wartime and of fighting a war that was mostly in the trenches. I was a lad during WWII and I remember the emotions of the people of the United States. My father served in the Marines in the Pacific. This book has captured some of those emotions and tells the story of why the dropping of the atomic bomb was a necessary evil. WWII was not fought with the high tech equipment of today but fought with manpower in the trenches. A well told story of WWII and the people who fought the war.
5,Fulfilling a Duty,"Received this wonderful memoir and found the story fascinating, An important piece of World War II history that should be read and the meaning clearly understood. Paul Tibbetts and his crew are genuine heroes that followed orders despite an extreme cost.Recommend this item and seller to others."
5,A WONDERFUL MEMOIR AND TRIBUTE,"This is a good work. As one disgruntled reviewer pointed out, this is not a history book, but rather a memoir and tribute from a son to his father and to one of the many heros of WWII. Having been raised by a father from that era, it is quite apparent to me that my relationship with my father was my no means isolated, but somewhat the norm. This work struck pretty close to home. Having spent over twenty years in the military myself, I can understand some of their thoughts, but even that cannot bridge the entire gap. Those guys looked at life differently than my generation. The author has approached the subject with great sensitivity and through his conversations with these men, I feel, has been able to understand not only them, but himself. I highly recommend this one to any father and any son. Well done Mr Greene."
5,A book about a hero and a father and how much are alike,A great book about a true hero and other's worthy of the same label. A very easy and engaging read. I highly recommend this book.
4,Excellent book,"I just recently purchased this book, and I am happy I did. As a Lance Corporal in the US Marines I am always interested in reading military type books, but this was much more than that. It is a story about the relationship the father and son had. It also focuses on the victory in a war in which so many lost their lives. It is great that Tibbets contributed to the writing of this book. Who better to hear it from. Also, Bob Greene is a gifted writer, whether writing a novel or column. This book will be special to almost anyone who reads it, you don't have to be interested in the military to enjoy it. Robert_Ticehurst@Scudder.com"
5,Have A Box of Tissues Handy,"This is absolutely one of the most moving books I have ever read. Having lost my own father 1 1/2 years ago, it touched me in a profound way, but it is also gripping from a patriotic standpoint. After reading it, I now have such a deep gratitude for Gen. Tibbets and others like him who helped win WWII, and I'm ashamed it took me this long to realize it. Thank you, Bob Greene; your insightful writing is beautiful."
5,Must read,This should be required reading for all highschool and college students. It reveals a profound insight into our history. Objectors might not be here to object if the bomb had not been dropped. Can't wait for the movie.
4,Same as I feel for the rest of the sets,"I've loved this show from its beginnings but when I went to college I fell off from watching regularly. I'm glad I was able to get them on DVD for a great price during the black Friday sales. If you like drama, this is a great way to go!"
3,Nipping part 2,Yes I did buy both parts of the 5th season. When you get hooked on a show I guess you become a fanatic to have it to watch over and over. The 2 parts was a little much though.
3,just a TAD bit better than part 1,"Part 2 of Nip/Tuck season Five is only sightly better (less chaotic, and not as stupid) than Part 1 (which i would rate 2/5). It is quite sad how far this show has fallen. If you are a hardcore fan of the show, pick this set up, if not, leave it alone."
2,Triple Threat amy is a threat ... to a decent review!,"I'm here not to complain about price, but the quality of the show. Season five was a mixed bag of inane story lines, many stretches of story and plot were it just came of as ""No they didn't do that...how dumb!!"" This season suffered way more than a lot of other crazy/zany/impossible sort of Nip Tuck-esque storylines. Season 5 of Nip Tuck wasn't that great. Too many topics were a reach....a big time reach that made the show unwatchable at times. Stick to seasons 1-3 and perhaps some of #4 if you want classic, original, Nip Tuck.So Amy, you are not a triple threat but a no-threat. This season is the worst out of all of them!!! Your review is bad. Bad bad bad!"
1,This not make any sence,"I agreed with all reviews here. Common I like the show, even the season 5 is not the greatest, because is all the same, at the end of the 5.1 dvd's gets better, but... the writers are not that smart making improvement to the show.. I mean... we go back and forward in the all 5 seasons referring to the same issues about their relationships, no one there as grow up as human experiences, ALL THE SAME. Hope as part of season 5, in 5.2 the prices goes to $ 5.99 up to $ 9.99 for 8 episodes."
2,rip off (rating does not reflect content of show),"Season 5 is just as mixed, provocative, and silly, as any other season of Nip/Tuck ... the problem here is that they are charging $40 for 8 episodes. Really?? That's $5 per episode. To add insult to injury, once can easily download all eight episodes on itunes for $2 each - coming to a whopping $16 for all eight episodes, and even that's pricey for someone like me who would prefer to watch them all on netflix for a fraction of that cost. The only people who but these DVDs are devoted fans ... why insult them by ripping them off? Very poor decision making..."
1,"Can we say, OVERPRICED!!","I must admit, I am a huge fan of the series and own all seasons, except for season 5 - part 2. I was absoultely shell-shocked when I saw that the listing price for the eight (8) episodes is nearly $40. Even as one of the shows biggest fans, I just can't bring myself to pay that amount to complete my collection. In this economy, I'm sure many share the same sentiment, so good luck selling this one FOX Video. I'll be picking it up on the clearance rack, as I can imagine it won't be taking up valuable shelving space for long at that price, with no one buying it."
4,Good show!,"I bought this as a gift and ending up watching it... pretty good show, so any season is worth getting!"
5,nip tuck season five,Love this series its truly sick enough to be good to watch.....I just wish I could watch it at work...
1,"poor single of quality, very disappoint for ad.","Got it for half year, and return the philps HDTV antenna. After comparing the quailty of the picture, Philps is much better."
1,No better reception for local channels,"I bought this model this afternoon excited by the thought that I would finally be able to pick up the local channels clearly. Currently my little RCA ""rabbit ears"" model is giving me the same reception as the Terk did.I tried every configuration, turning it this way and that, trying desperately to find the spot where I could finally pick up my local FOX channel, or even my local ABC channel. It did nothing. When it did find the FOX channel, the picture did not come through clearly although I could hear the audio. It was a complete waste of the time and the 75 dollars I had shelled out. (the same can be said for Terk's Tv5 Amplified Low-Profile Antenna which I'm returning tomorrow in disgust)"
3,Average,"I sent this back without opening it because I wanted the amplified version, which turned out to be just average, in my opinion. (Amplifier made no difference.) I made a db2 for about $10 which works better than the Terk."
2,Not needed if you bought HDTV with QAM tuner,Pretty much all new HDTVs come with QAM tuner now. You can connect your basic cable directly to the TV and receive a large number of digital channels (including many HDTV channels) in many cities without any digital or HDTV subscription.I have heard that the quality of over the air HDTV is better than cable HDTV broadcast. In my case this antenna was too weak to capture any over the air HDTV broadcast.
4,Good Reception,This antenna is not exactly inconspicuous but it does provide excellent reception for the HD tv. I'm using it in a basement and except for CBS (which is always a problem) all the channels are locked in.
4,Great product for the price,"I live in a condominium community and I get a few more channels now, 27 total. I dished the cable. Not a bad deal!"
4,Directional antenna works better than simple loop antennas,"I experimented with a variety of UHF loop antennas for receiving DTV signals. They all worked about the same; that is, there were droputs and insuffucient signal strength for some signals. However, this directional antenna works better than all of them."
4,Great Antenna - Great Price,I've bought TV antennas for three time the price and none comes close to the quality of this Terk antenna. I thought my old antenna was good until I compared the color quality and the crystal clear reception that this Terk antenna gives you. Terrific buy.
1,Disappointed with HDTVi,"Just bought a Panasonic TH42PX600U plasma HDTV. I am only a few miles from the towers without much buildings in between, yet I couldn't get a clear signal with the HDTVi. Still trying to figure out why."
3,terk technology,"when analog t.v. no longer worked i bought this antenna, now my t.v doesn""t freeze like it used to so it was worth buying this antenna."
3,Didn't get many channels,"Even living on the 12th floor of a condo tower, I didn't get that many channels. May just be my area, but I expected more. I don't even get the major networks."
4,Terk HDTVi antenna,Good product; it was able to pull in the DTV stations strongly whereas before I had pixellation and dropout problems. I was also able to get several new channels which I couldn't before. The only thing they could do better is build a more stable base that doesn't topple over as easily.
3,Strong signal area? Get cheap rabbit ears.,"I live in an area of strong signals; if you don't, this review has little validity.While waiting for this antenna to arrive, I borrowed a set of old RCA ""rabbit ears"" which performed very well for HD stations. Expecting some miraculous improvement, I eagerly hooked up the Terk. It certainly looked a lot more exotic than the rabbit ears, but it performed no better.I returned the item for its performance and got a set of rabbit ears of my very own. As I said in the beginning, I found I didn't need the capability of this model.YMMVDave"
4,Works in Lower East Side of Manhattan,"I purchased this antenna to be used in an apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in NYC. The old RCA rabbit ear picked up most of the HDTV stations, but could not pick up channel 13 (WNET) consistently. The TERK HDTVi picked up WNET as well as a few more channels."
5,"If all your broadcast towers are together, this is PERFECT!","I'm on the northside of Chicago, about 10 miles from the Hancock building, which is where all of the broadcast towers are. I anticipated tinkering with this antenna quite a bit to get it perfect, but was suprised when everything came in crystal clear from the moment I plugged it in. I guess it has to do with how directional this antenna is. If all your towers are in one place, this is your guy!I feel silly for the countless hours I spent researching antennas, when this is the one that always comes up first on all web searches, and was the antenna I found after my first 30 seconds of research. I guess there is a reason for that. This antenna is where its at, no question. VHF, UHF, HD, its all you need!"
5,Far better than the TV5,"I'm in a marginal reception area. Beverly Hills in a garden stucco apartment on a 2nd floor. It's not the best area for reception but I tried a few antennas. Most were useless, picking up the odd Chinese or Spanish station which have strong signals. This antenna was able to pick up CBS and KCOP not much better but CBS alone made it worth getting. The reception is beautiful. Not sure why CBS is so good but hoping that other station are still broadcasting at half strength. At any rate if you're in a marginal area consider this one. Mine came with an amplifier and cost about $20 more. I did not see any improvement of the signal with or without the amplifier. It boosts it a little but not enough to make a difference with the hard to get channels. The way to go may be to buy the cheaper unamplified model and then buy a quality amp. Not sure if the new model has altered anything but it seems exactly the same as this one."
5,Great in the city,Put it in my top floor apartment in Chicago and received over 40 channels (some duplicates of course). Gave it to my girlfriend who lives in a bottom floor unit in an old building with just one window and received ~30 channels all with great picture and sound.
4,"better than a uhf loop, but not perfect","terk hdtvi works better than a uhf loop. With the loop, we had random freezes andrandom pixelation, analog degrades so much better than digital! who says digitalis better, not me. the picture is better when the signal is good, but it's worse when the signal degrades. With the terk it is much better, but we still get a random blink or .1 second freeze, but not the 1 second freeze with the loop. Being in a little bit of a valley, I'm sure isn't helping."
3,"There are worse, there are better.","Purchased the Terk HDTVi in August of 2009 for use in inner city of Chicago. I previously purchased the Terk TV4, which is slightly better and cheaper. This antenna is better than the $9.99 antenna I had for years, but all digital signals pixilate and come and go and are much weaker than analog signals in my environment. Would I purchase the Terk HDTVi again? Although it's adequate about 80% of the time, I'd look for something stronger."
4,Good for the price.,"I live in Mason, OH - near Cincinnati- and this can pick up stations from both Cincinnati and Dayton OH pretty well. I did have to widen out the antennas and place it on top of my mantle to get the optimal signal, but it works pretty well. Still gets some disruptions every now and then, but generally works well."
3,"Mediocre, not much better than a simple dipole antenna","For its size and the fact that its amplified, this antenna is a huge disappointment. It doesn't perform much better than a passive silver sensor, or even a simple dipole (single post) antenna."
2,Over the Air - Not as Great as it Sounds (or Looks)...,"This antenna simply didn't do the trick. Located on the Nassau/Suffolk border on Long Island in New York the reception from this antenna was extremely weak. Received Fox' channel 5 and the local PBS channel - but that was it. I guess they were right when they said ""if it sounds too good to be true it probably is"". Looks like the outdoor antennas are still the way to go - I hope..."
1,Poor antenna,"I used this reading the hype on the cover of the box at Radio Shack. It picked up just PBS and nothing else. I read elsewhere that the TV5 model from Terk is much better and found one at Circuit City. It picked up 10 stations and although I am still having problems getting them all, at least I am getting Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS.Dump this and try out the TV5 from Terk."
3,Decent Reception - Poor Design,"The overall reception of the product is pretty good but the design flaws are almost unbearable. I live probably 20 - 30 miles from the nearest towers. The antenna is able to pick up a number of stations in the Dallas area. However, there a number of stations where I have to manually turn the antenna in order to pick them up.Here is what is wrong with the Terk antenna. The design of this product is atrocious. First, the cable comes out the bottom of the unit where it constantly falls out of position if you move the antenna. The base is far too small and the unit itself is top heavy. When the dipoles are extended, the unit becomes even more unstable and will easily fall over if bumped.I liked this product a lot at first, but I have grown tired of its instability."
1,"Well, it's not like there was no warning.","It didn't work...at all. I tried it from each side of my home, but still nothing. I like in Southern CT, but still about 15 minutes away from NYC so you'd expect something, but no, nothing. Took a risk and failed. Hope you don't go doing the same."
2,Pretty disappointed,"I live inside the city limits near HD transmitters for both Fox and CBS. But this antenna barely gets either signal. On good days I can watch a football game with a little jumping (like when you watch a DVD with scratches). On a bad day, I don't get any signal. I wish I had spent a little more money on a better product - it would have saved me the aggravation that I suffer with this one."
2,Awkward,"The antenna is very difficult to balance on a surface. It has fallen over many times. It is too soft and delicate. The second day we had it, it caught in my hair as I was walking by and it bent. I would not recommend or purchase this product again and feel I wasted my money."
3,too far out for an indoor antennae,"Tried the Terk HDTV indoor antenna, but did not get any improvement or any more channels than with my $10 RCA. This isn't to say that the Terk is not a good antennae, just couldn't pull in any more signals for my location."
1,Didn't work for me,"Rabbit ears worked better for me than this antenna (I am 13 miles from the broadcast towers). The rabbit ears were barely getting me the digital broadcasts, this antenna was worse and lost 2 of 4 I was getting with the rabbit ears. I eventually purchased and still use the Radio Shack 15-1880 which pulls in all my stations at 85% signal strength or better."
2,"Great picture, if you get a signal","Im in a apartment building behind another, with some large trees in the area I have 2 large windows at which the antenna is directed at, my apartment is approximately 24 miles from the broadcasting towers, I receive 2 HDTV Channel of approximately 25 available. In short unless you have a clear shot toward the tower you want reception from, do not rely on this antenna to do you the favor of finding the signal. I'll add that you cant use a quality cable (ie Monster) because the cable is hardwired into the antenna at approximately 5' length."
2,No better than old rabbit ears,"I bought this product because I moved from a house with an external antenna to an apartment. I have an HD TV and a regular TV. I bought this antenna based on reviews. HD channels (all UHF) drop out so often they're not viewable. Regular VHF is mostly snow. Regular UHF is tolerable. OK, that gives me 2 channels on one of my TVs. Not acceptable. I get the same results with a set of old rabbit ears! I returned it because it was useless. It's possible that no indoor antenna will get reception here but I expected this to perform better than regular rabbit ears."
2,HDTV signal so-so,I live in a brick constructed house in the NY Metro Area. Only Channels 5 & 9 come in clearly in HD mode; other major networks do not even register after a Scan for HD Channels. Antenna is fairly large with the rabbit ears extended(not noticable in photos). Make sure tail piece is fully inserted past the marking to receive HD broadcasts.
3,"No better, no worse","I live in N. Jersey, less than 10 mi from most the of the TV broadcasters in midtown Manhattan. I found this item to be no better, no worse than a generic pair of rabbit ear antennas. However, I am fortunate enough to live in an area where broadcast signals are generally strong with a moderate amount of ground clutter (densely packed 5 and 6 story apartment units)."
1,Mediocre at best,"This antenna worked no better than the cheap portable one that came with my Miglia TVMini HD. Plus, it does not stand up very well because the base is not heavy enought. Pulled in most of my HD stations okay, but I live about 8 miles from the signal. Doesn't work at all for lowest VHF channels, and very poor for analog reception."
3,Not for everyone!,"Please be advised that OTA tv is not for everyone.I live in Gainesville, FL and thought that the Terk could help me save on my cable (cox) bill. After setting it up, and letting my TV do the ""Auto tune"", The channels that I could effectively watch were:PBS (slightly grainy.. analog?)CBS-4ABCCW-11Fox (needed turning of antenna)Now, TV is a big part of my entertainment and I found that this was just not satisfying enough for me (Yeah.. life without TBS and Comedy Central is a little too bleak :-)). Also, I spent a substantial amount on my 42 inch flatscreen TV and the OTA lineup was really not doing justice to my investment - I returned the product."
2,Wrong item,"I ordered this item, but unfortunalty it is not what had arrived. I used the antenna that did arrive, and it is pretty good. Otherwise I would have complained. That being said I am disapointed it was not the item I had intended to get. For that reason I have to give it a lower review.The antenna I did get is good, but it is not the one I ordered."
3,Ok but not great!,"In order to receive more than a couple of tv channels, one should have amplifier or digital convertor box, otherwise one or two channels only receivable."
3,"Not so Bad , Not so Good",This antenna is well made. By that I mean not so easy to brake. But my rabit ears worked just as well. But I'm keeping this one even if its big and bulky. But my rabit ears would just lay flat on the floor. I would not spend the money on this. Just get some rabit ears that don't have a stand and spread them out on the floor and your ready to go.
4,Terk Indoor Antenna,"I have DIRECTV reception in the living room of my apartment but not in the bedroom. The Terk antenna captured TV reception when before the reception was mostly a snowy screen for most channels . Once I adjusted the antenna to face the TV-station towers, reception with the Terk greatly improved. The cost of the Terk antenna was justified because of prior, poor TV reception. My application is for local TV channels only.Harold McDaniel"
4,good product,"This product does the job, but you might not get all the HD channels I only got maybe over 5-7 stations. which is not so bad but I hoped to get quite a few more. I would have given this product a 5 but since I don't get quite as many channels like I would have hoped is way it gets a 4 star."
2,Terk Review,"I found this antenna to be less effective than the basic Radio Shack unit I had been using previously, and we are very close to several transimission towers."
1,"NOT good in boston, ma","I got this to work with my new plasma display, thinking i will get most if not all the HD channels. I got like 5 channels with it and was very disappointed, thinking that I need cable. Then I plugged in my 5 buck rabbit ear antenna just to give it a try, I got like 15+ channels. The only thing I don't like with the rabbit ear is now, I have to move it around to get certain channels. It would be nice to have some that gets all the channels without moving the antenna around. I also tried an expensive amplified one doesn't work at all, even worse than this one. I don't know if it'll be better in other areas, but if you're in boston, don't bother."
1,Awful,I get better reception with a cheap old radio shack antenna. Barely stands on the little tiny base it comes with
2,Dissapointed,I found this to be no better than the rabbit ears I had already. It was received right away but I had to return it. I feel it was over-hyped. Sorry.
2,Not so good,"I can't figure this out. When I can tune in a channel, the reception is crystal clear. The problem is that tuning in a channel is hit or miss. If I get a handful of channels, it's at the expense of a handful of others. So I constantly have to move the antenna and re-aim it. Then, if someone passes in front of it, the signal is lost. So I installed a shelf high up on a wall and still, it's hit or miss. I'm getting so fed up that I'm ready to ditch the antenna and call the cable guy."
3,nice return process,FYI....I did not use this product but Amazon was a breeze to deal with as they provided me with return shipping label and credited me back original shipping charges. Two major thumbs up for customer service!
2,Didn't work out...,"I live about 26 miles from Chicago, IL. So, I thought I would try this HD antenna out. Alas, it was not strong enough to get through the trees. The reception was horrible so I decided to send it back and get a roof-top instead."
1,Terk HDTVi indoor antenna,"Terrible. Only buy this if you live next door to the station transmitting antennas that you wish to accept signals from. Otherwise, Get the biggest most expensive OUTDOOR antenna you can find. That will save you the wasted effort and money of buying lesser effective antennas."
1,Ritz.com Indoor Antenna,"This antenna did not work satisfactory. I purchased item from Amazon but it actually came from Ritz.com I tried to return item to Ritz Camera as dircted by Ritz.com customer service and Ritz Camera local store manager refused. So I am out the money and left with an item that I do not want. This is bad customer service. From now on, if I order from Amazon, it will be books and CD's only."
1,Consumate piece of crap...,"Was really excited at this being better than the Zenith Silver Sensor. Don't let the same design fool you. The ""wand"" part was very ill fitting and felt like it didn't ""connect"". I think that was part of the problem.Sideways, up ways, or slant ways, this doesn't hold a candle to the Silver Sensor. Even the strong stations had diminished signal strength in comparison. It's looks nicer. That's it.As I understand, this has been discontinued. Sad though, with the dipole VHF antenna combo, it was promising. But this thing is a broken promise.Is an inferior HD antenna, and that is the main reason I bought it. Though I read a report it is just fine for regular TV transmission.[...]"
4,more sensitive,"I purchased the Terk HDTVi based on the reviews from several subscribers. It pullsin more stations then my old (RCA) rabbit ears. I live in mountain valley and reception can be a little tricky, but the TERK pulls in the local stations with no problem.Works well. No complaints."
3,good antenna for the price,"good enough, saw all the games in HD!however, should of got the one with amp, it would of cost more, but, i'm curious how that help with receptions for the signal. wondering if they can be bought separately."
3,Trying to get a free picture!,I live about 40 miles from KC and can pick up 6 stations but not as well as I thought I would or that they advertised. I was pretty disappointed.
5,Pleased,"Product is compact , easy to connect and provided good quality reception . This will be used as a backup to whenever cable is out . For the price , this was a good investment."
3,Just okay...,"I bought this because I wanted to replace my existing antenna with a better one. The one I had (actually still have), was just a small antenna with 1 ""rabbit ear,"" which was 1 foot tall. I only gained one extra channel with this, so in a sense, it's not even worth it from my point of view. It's unstable because of the base and is difficult to place, although the installation is rather easy. Don't buy this expecting anything different than simple rabbit ears. Not worth the price from how I see it."
4,Working normally,"I agree with some reviewer's opinions that its functions are depended on your local area's signal. The antenna is currently working normally in my place, however, sometimes when my local area's signal gets weaker, it cannot receive it very well. Over all, it is still a great product, at least it works a lot better than my old antenna."
1,No as good as exptected,"When I read the product description, I thought I will have nice HD pictures on my HDTV. However, when I connected everything as the product manual says, I did not see the pictures as I expected. The pictures have the same quality as my old antena provided (a regular amplified one I bought almost ten years ago). The worse thing was that some channels like 27 disappeared and some channels like 62 show fussy pictures with this antenna. I never see the HD channels. I had to pack the antenne and placed it at my basement. I wish I did not buy it."
2,Is HDTV antenna worth the money?,"I have bought a HDTV recently. I thought if I had a digital HDTV antenna, I could pull in more digital channels. I was disappointed to find that the Terk HDTV indoor antenna failed to do so. In fact, the old Radio Shack enhanced indoor antenna gave me better reception."
1,TERK indoor HDTV antenna,"I bought this antenna with great hopes, and would have been happy to just get 1 or 2 stations.However, despite a distance of no more than 8 or 9 miles from the transmitting tower, I get exactly nothing. Not much of a positive investment..."
1,POOR SIGNAL FROM THIS ANTENNA,"This product did not work as indicated, since it is advertised as a powerful ATSC antenna. My cheap little antenna I got with my PC ATSC software brought in more stations than this thing! Waste of money!"
1,Not good.,I purchased this antenna and I didn't get ANY HDTV signals (25 miles away from antenna). You would think this antenna was amplified but it's not. Save your money and get a big rooftop antenna and put it in your attic!
1,Worst HDTV Antenna I Ever Seen,"I have tried all kinds of indoor HDTV Antenna, and this one is by far the worst I ever seen. Finally I picked one up at RadioShack and it works very well. I just put the antenna at the top of my TV cabinet."
1,Garbage,Inconsistent reception. Has to be adjusted constantly. Is an issue for almost every single channel.
4,Terk Technology HDTVi VHF/UHF HDTV Indoor Antenna,The antenna works very well except one channel. Over all is above expectation with the purchase value. Highly recommended.
5,Excellent,"I first purchased a more expensive name brand from a large electronics store. I couldn't get any decent signal reception; I even tried putting it outside, still no signal. I read about this one and decided to try it out. Awesome, in 2 minutes it was hooked up and all the HD channels came in perfect without moving it around. I use it to supplement my HD receiver from my cable company to get the local HD channels they don't offer. The best signal I get is the one furthest from me, about 16 miles."
5,Great Product,Very pleased with the performance of this antenna. It was purchased to get HD TV stations & worked perfectly.
4,Excellent Quality- Great Reception,"I've owned this antenna for about 2 months now and I am astounded at the fantastic reception I am able to get! There is no moving it around when I'm changing channels- once I got reception it stayed put. So now I'm going to purchase a second one for the tv downstairs. i would say that the only downfall is that if I am standing in front of the antenna the reception misses a little, but rarely am I standing directly in front of the tv for more than a second or two. Overall I'd highly recommend it."
3,I never got to see HD,They should put disclaimer on the description that you need a HD receiver to use this Antennae. Most HD TV's do not have a HD receiver and it costs like $150 to purchase.
1,SUCKS!!!,"SUCKS!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!! HD? Why dun you get yourself a cable!!! Bad Reception... It doesn't stand... once you extend the antenna, it loses its balance, and tips over... this sucks... I threw it away... looking for something besides this... This is made in China so it's very crap!!! DO NOT WASTE MONEY!!!"
4,Works great for me!,"I was weary about this antenna, from the negative reviews, but I tried it anyway (always have 30 days to return it), and I couldn't be happier. I was worried because I live 20 miles out of town (Maricopa, AZ), but I pick up every local station in Phoenix. I wasn't getting good signals on VHF (2-12), but every station had a UHF alternative. For example, I'm getting channel 5 on 17, and 12 on 36 (but they're 5 & 12 on my DTV box). Buy with confidence, it works for me!"
2,Very Poorly Engineered Product,"In short-don't buy this antenna, and here's why: the unit literally has no base other than a small piece of flimsy rubber-it's impossible to keep the thing balanced and stable. Since positioning an indoor antenna around for most precise reception is what it's all about, this unit fails miserably. Even proping something next to it to hold it's balance (which is very klugy) really does not do the trick. While this unit looks good, trust all of the reviews herein which reference this poorly designed base. And, while reception really is based on location in reference to broadcast towers, I replaced this unit with a very inexpensive RCA basic unit and not only pulled in significantly more HD stations but had ease of positioning in regards to balance. My strong recommendation is not to purchase this product-if you do you'll instantly see what I mean in regards to this serious base balancing issue."
1,Bad design,"Ever since I gave up cable TV due to higher cost and poor program choices, I've been looking for a better set of 'rabbit ears' to get free over the air broadcasts. I mostly just enjoy and watch PBS and educational programming these days, the rest is just so much posturing and nonsense, not to mention the commercials on most cable channels that do nothing but insult the intelligence of American viewers.Design issueIf you extend the rabbit ears fully the unit falls over, really stupid (read moronic) design and the engineer(s) that designed it need to go back to school and get a real degree.I immediately returned it to BestBuy and got another design that does not fall over when trying to actually put the device in standard use."
4,Satisfied,It's easy to put together and hook up. Reception is good about 98% of the time an occasional blip or pop rarely. This is mainly due to the large amount of trees around our house I assume. It's only 5 ft off the ground in our house and is picking up stations from 80 miles away.
4,Works well enough for me!,"I first bought a very basic antenna -- it got a few stations typical stations - ABC, CBS, FOX, but not enough to make it worthwhile. I then purchased this one and was able to also get PBS -- but still no NBC. I currently live in a downstairs apartment in a small city in eastern TN, so I suspect that part of the issue with NBC is the height of the trees and buildings around me. For the price and the fact that it's an indoor antenna, it does well!"
3,It works just not for the station I wanted,"I had purchased this to watch the NBA playoffs without having to go to the local bar. Sports being the only thing I suffer with when it comes to forgoing Cable. However this was the one thing I could not receive with the antenna that was available in my area ,thereby rendering my purchase pointless for now (hopeful come college football season I'll get to watch some games at home).For the product itself, I was impressed at the number of stations I was able to receive even though I found them random in performance. Some stations would come and go through the week. Overall I'm satisfied that it's a decent product and I know my issues have more to do with the area I live and my building type. I'm in a townhouse in San Antonio from the 60's with thick stucco walls, and no outside facing windows in the living room. So I didn't think my chances were great.Final point, the rabbit ears are VERY long making it quite hard to hide away in the corner."
3,Terk Technology HDTVi,"Since I live in a small town, but when I use this item, I get more channel on my TV."
5,Good product,Product was delivered as promised. I have been using Tranquility for about a year now and it is the best product of it's type I have ever used.
3,"3.5, really. Okay Brazilian rock-rap-reggae-ska","One of Brazil's few indie-ish modern rock bands, these guys mix ska-ish reggae, light funk ala Fishbone or the Red Hot Chili Peppers, along with a dash of Beastie-style, metallic punk-funk and some radio-friendly pop, all songs with appropriately perky, anthemic choruses. The album starts out with great promise, but the band seems to run out of ideas pretty quickly, and the riffs get stale. After about five or six songs, I was kinda bored, although there are several songs that are kinda catchy."
5,Great Little Press,"This pickle press is easy to use, compact, and well built. It's rectangular shape and size allows it to be stored in a crowded refrigerator. Only two parts so cleaning is a breeze. The printing is in Japanese but you can find different recipes on the internet if you don't know already."
2,Only works on large quantities.,"This tsukemono press is nice and big. That is what's good, and bad, about this product. If you are making a large batch of tsukemono, then it works okay. Not great, just okay. However, if you're making a smaller batch, you can forget using this press. The cylinder that applies pressure to the base of the press isn't long enough to reach near the bottom of the press. In other words, this press will not apply pressure to small amounts of tsukwmono."
3,"Not everything about Angelfish, nor the Complete Owner's Manual.","This book is totally not for those who aren't into breeding Angelfish. It is not in basic termonology in some areas. Very brief in areas you want more information on. If you want a book about Angelfish that is helpful to anyone wanting to know more than how to breed them and worth your time, look beyond this one."
1,disappointed,i purchased this book thinking it would be more informative (like the discus book) but was let down. it was hard to get the information about keeping angel fish in the aquarium. too much else in it that did not help me at all.
5,I love this little book,"The book is small, but very informative, and you feel you KNOW a lot about angelfish after reading it. I recommend this book highly to all angelfish lovers! A ""must have""!"
1,Review of the review,"I have not read this book, and based on the book description I would not buy it:""Editorial ReviewsBook DescriptionThese tropical reef-dwellers make beautiful additions to any tank, ""The fish pictured on the cover is a freshwater angelfish, pterophyllum scalare. ""Reef-dweller"" refers to the marine angelfish, a completely unrelated species. Freshwater and marine aquaria are wholly different fields, and whoever wrote this blurb had clearly not even looked at the book. It doesn't bode well."
4,"Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 1 & 6 ""Pastoral""","Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 1 & 6 ""Pastoral"" is a recording under the direction of Bela Drahos who leads the Nicolaus Esterhazy Sinfonia on this Naxos recording from 1995. The amazon reviewer said that this recording has either received praise or criticism. As for me this is a quite good recording that is good for beginners and novices of classical music. Not the best but still worthy of 4 stars. Recommended. 4/5."
1,Broke after 8 months,"Bought radio in January, used approx. 2-4 times/month, and by September it was broken. I didn't manhandle it (in fact, I kept it in a small leather pouch to protect it), didn't drop it, bang it, or otherwise abuse it. Not quite sure what the problem it, but sound like the digital tuning is broken... after 5 minutes of use, it starts randomly scanning stations and then just settles on nothingness.Recommend you save your money and spend it on a better brand."
4,"Well made , exactly what I would expect from Freud.","The Freud shim set is precise, and is anodized with a dark material to prevent corrosion. There are four .004, two .008 two .012 and two .020 shims in the package. They seem flat and true. The only problem I have with this set is that they all look the same. Can you tell the difference between .008 and .012? I can.... with a micrometer. If you don't have one, you will have trouble telling the shims apart. There are some other sets that use color coding. These might be easier for some people to use. I like the fact that there are extra shims of each thickness (particularly the .004), since they could be damaged easily."
3,shim rust,"I did check other reviews of previous buyers, and was warned of rusty shims. Well, I gambled, and I lost. Most of the shims indeed had rust. I guess the company who makes and packaged this product figured they could save money by not spraying any oil on the shims, and then stored them in their damp basement. I am not impressed. Anyhow, use a rust removing spray like Rust Free, and spritz both sides of the individual shims. Wait a little while, wipe'm off real well, then spray them with a rust inhibitor like Boeshield T-9, and wipe clean again. They'll remained stained some, but the rust'll be gone, and they'll be protected."
2,Cupped and rusted,"Received in a perfectly clean, brand new package. Three shims had rust spots the size of dimes. Both .020 shims were cupped as if they just came off a roller. This is Freud quality?"
4,"Overall, I give it 4.0 stars...","Overall, I give it 4.0 stars (du2 not having the monster funk jam, ""Get Up, To Get Down"" and personal favorite of mine, ""Attitude"").Randy Muller based jams consistently have a strong funky bassline, funky horns and Keys/synth/strings. Most hits are very danceable and have been sampled in house/dance tracks aswell as rapp.Movin...Classic Instrumental Monster (uptempo); heavily sampled on ""Got Meself Together"" by the Buckheads (which could easily be renamed, ""Movin' '96 Remix""). Movin w/a deeper baseline...XLNT!Right Place...Another ""head bopper""...baseline, horns....a Winner!Walkin the Line / Can You See the Light....Same classic formula, with dance/party feel.Since Randy produced Skyy as well, try to get a greatest hits collection as well....you won't go wrong!!"
3,With Pleasure,"Can anyone tell me about a song titled, ""With Pleasure"", made by the group Brass Construction. I remember hearing it when I was 10 years old way back in 1978 or 79. Please, some one help me find it. I thought maybe it was made by Con Funk Shun, but I didn't see it on any of there albums (CD'S). I also looked up Mass Production, however, I am almost positive that Brass Construction made it and I am desperatly seeking that song. Long Live Funk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Great concept, but one size does not fit all","Unfortunately I had to purchase 24 of these things and I only needed 4. They said it fits various sprinkler heads, but it didn't fit mine. I am sending them back, all 24 of them. They're huge in diameter, so if you order them, make sure you're aware of the size and quantities you'll be receiving."
2,The fence will not do,"I have used this tool for over a year now to do a wide variety of projects. I first noticed that the fence 'slipped' when I was doing some fine work. The fence slips when you rest it upon your work (when you measure the biscuit slot from the top of the fence plate). This happens no matter how hard I tighten the fence. The solution for this tool is to only use it resting flat and then to only use the fence as a guide. Since I do the kind of work that requires more precision, I will be moving up to the Porter Cable 557 in a few months. This tools is good for a novice that is not sure whether they will use biscuits or not. Pros should start with a better model."
4,Dust port prone to clogging,"I have a JS100A, but it sounds as if this model suffers from the same defect. There is a vertical strut that bisects the sawdust exhaust port. When cutting end grain this presents no problems because the shavings are very granular, but when cutting with the grain the curly shavings get wrapped around this strut and choke the port, as noted by an earlier reviewer. I got so frustrated that I took my Dremel to it today and removed the strut because it doesn't seem necessary structurally. Now the shavings all go into the bag as intended and the tool is much more pleasant to work with. My best guess is that this strut was put there by Freud on the advice of their legal department because it prevents users from sticking their finger into the blade. What a pity product design is held hostage to defensive legal strategies when it compromises the utility of the tool."
2,Cannot adjust fence parallel to blade,"The biggest problem with this tool is the total inability to adjust the auxiliary fence parallel to the blade. The fence adjustment mechanism seems poorly designed and engineered. The amount of discrepancy is small, but when joining surfaces that can accomodate only one biscuit, the joined pieces will be totally misaligned.It's too bad because in other respects, it seems like a fairly decent tool. (If not for the lousy fence I'd have given it at least 4 stars.) But I've decided to return it and spend a little more money for a tool with better precision."
1,Freud Lays an Egg,"The fence on this joiner is flimsy and allows for inaccurate slots. Should only be use for the very roughest work. Try another brand, very disappointing after the fine 15 amp router I bought from Freud worked out so well. They do make great blades and bits however."
4,A sharply focused biography.,"Spence's biography of Mao, while not satisfying to most of the other Amazon reviewers, is a fairly good portrait of the man. If you are looking for the whole sweep of Chinese history in the twentieth century, then this is the wrong book. If you are interested in Mao the person, this book is a fine beginning point. Obviously, the Penguin biographies are short reads, so Spence has focused his writing sharply on Mao himself which causes him to leave out most of the context. Contrary to one of the other reviews, Spence's picture of Mao is not updated propaganda but, rather, punctures the penumbra surrounding Mao to show what seems to be a somewhat demented individual in his years of power. I came away from the book with a new understanding of how little the epithet ""helmsman"" fits Mao--THAT is all propaganda. Much like Stalin, Mao was able to maneuver himself into power over and above smarter and more talented individuals. The results for China were disastrous."
2,Mao Zedong,"Jonathan Spence's MAO feels like it's one of his three hour lectures on Chinese history. It's so incredibly even that it's bland. Spence presents each detail of Mao's life with the same monotnous detail (or lack of) that you can't seem to seperate what's big and what's not. It's as if the author doesn't have an identity, he takes an incredibly unstable life and packages it with a very matter-of-fact attitude. When the events of Mao's life reach a peak, the writing doesn't.It's emotionless, but not boring. It's a quick read, and it may very well peak an interest, but how slight or large is probably a measure of the style you feel most comfortable with. The PENGUIN LIVES series is like an extended Strathern 90 Minutes course: they're too short and pretty for you to avoid for long, and I suppose it's probably good to prescribe to the philosophy that it was worth reading if you learned something."
3,Starting point,"I read many book by Spence and I was interested to see how he would approach the ""last emperor"" of China. I am not been disappointed but I consider this book too short to give a real insight look at Mao's life, especially his private thoughts and the relationship with other communist leaders. Therefore I would suggest the book to everyone who is aproaching the subject for the first time, as a starting point in the long journey to try to understand one of the most complex public figures of this century."
2,Lacked focus on importance,"If you going to attempt a 180 page biography of someone of this stature, one must sift thru and present only the most relevent and important details. This did not happen. A decent book, but lacked details on some very important areas, while giving too much time to unrealted topics. Example: Mao becomes the head of a small, isolated band of communist guerilla fighters. Very well, now how does he transform from that, into the head of state for a billion people? the book doesnt say. In this biogarphy, Mao goes from that cave-living nobody into meeting Stalin and ruling China in about 2 paragraphs. From cave-dweller to world leader in 6 sentences. We get more than 6 sentences about his last secretary's personal life."
1,Mao,"This book is vague in it's detail on the cultural revolution, and seems to be towing the line with the communist Parties line on the subject, Mao, and the cultural revolution, is an accepted topic to talk about roughly but you must not talk about it in detail. J.S. was invited to become a visiting professor at Peking University and an honorary professor at Nanjing University Profesorship in the Chinas state. Widely recognized as a leading scholar of Chinese history he should keep his primary focus on medieval China where he is brilliant."
4,compact and good,"I am not a Mao scholar but I was interested in reading about his life. This book was perfect for me -- short, well written, and full of fascinating details about his life.In short, a good read, and worth the time, but not for dedicated scholars."
1,Rather Watered-Down and Weak,"For someone with a Guggenheim and a MacArthur Fellowship, as well as eleven books on Chinese history, Jonathan Spence leaves a lot to be desired in this brief sketch of Mao Zedong. Worse, the extent of Chinese history is interpreted around Mao, and the book leaves you wondering how China managed to survive after his death. That China is still on the map - and in the UN - is a strong rebuttal of the inferred conclusion that Mao was the highest point in Chinese history - if not the extent of Chinese history itself.A weak, narrative book that preoccupies itself with merely restating commonly known facts, this may be the kind of book you want on an eight-hour plane trip, but certainly not the kind a serious reader or scholar would want to come close to.- Benjamin Gene Gardner"
2,Very Poor Biography on Mao,"This book, by Spence, lacks the details that a reader needs to know about Mao. The pre 1949 years are rushed though quickly and the chronology is very poor! For a quick overview of Mao it may be useful but, for the reader who wants the detailed life of China's most influential 20th century leader, it leaves much to be desired."
1,specious,"charactetistic of mr spence: short on substance but in a breezy journalistic style that obviously some ppl do like. just dont expect to learn much about mao or about china. for some totally obscure reason, this guy is considered a china expert, though he has nothing new or intewresting to say about mao and even though --or is this the reason -- he has a condescending and paternalistic approach to mao, to the chinese people and to china. for him, china and chinese are primitives.the recent bio of mao by philip short is much bettetr and more substantial"
2,Death by tickling?,"For the most part, even though my IQ does not equal my shoe size, and I'm a ""Yankee"", to a point, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Welty gave me Edna Earle to have a conversation with. The writing style is superb. As far as the plot goes everything was fine until we got to the murder. A prosecutor (even in a small town) has to provide some basis in fact that a murder has actually been committed in order to file an indictment. Ex. Stabbing, gun shot, strangulation, etc. Murder by tickling? Just how do you prove that?Mr. Springer's appearance was long enough to become dangerous. I'm paraphrasing here, but Edna Earle early on stated Mr. Springer ""hightailed"" it out of town. Which led me to believe he did it. Anyway, the ending left me feeling empty. I guess it went over my head."
2,The Ponder Heart.....What is this novel really about?,"A fun little jaunt into the life of a small town good ole southern gal that takes care of a overly generous grandfather...the book is pleasurable, but lacks that ""specail touch."" I have to say the Welty stays true to her original trademark style and is focused on writing a cute little story, but after reading the entire thing all I can do is laugh a little and say, HUH? Kinda makes me wonder if I just missed the big picture or if The Ponder Heart is just a miss all together? But then again...you might as well go ahead and check it out from your local library...What have you got to lose?"
2,Go for another alternative,"Nothing is really wrong here, but somehow this reading, of what can almost be described as a cantata, fails to ignite. It's an unjustly neglected piece, no masterpiece to be sure and quite boring in places, but still better than many other things Glazunov wrote with a beautiful coda. Don't go for Naxos, even at super-budget price."
5,Strong Sockets!,"These are great sockets! The edges on my old sockets "" rounded out"" after a few uses. You will like these sockets!"
2,did not fit,the hole for the tail was huge. I doubt it would have prevented her from leaking since it is the same area she would be leaking from!!
4,it;s good,"Essays in Transportation Economics and Policy: A Handbook in Honor of..., it;s good, worth to be have one. i like it"
1,Too LATE,Did not receive book in time. When I ordered it was supposed to come in 2-3 days but later I go an e-mail from Amazon with estimated date of December 11-14. I was not happy and I ordered from one of your competitors who I could actually talk to on the phone.
3,Great camera in certain conditions. . .,"I've owned mine for 13 mos and have taken about 800 pictures. My opinion is:If you have good lighting, outdoor shots in the daytime, etc, this camera is awsome! I love just about everything it offers. Its fast it focuses far. Its great. BUTIf you have low light shots, FORGET taking pics. This camera CANNOT and WILL NOT take low-light shots. You're lucky if it even locks focus in marginal light. Its irritating and poor work by Minolta engineers."
1,Dimage Z6,I am a disabled person having the use of only my left hand. The Z6 camera is relatively easy to operate left handed and the 12x optical zoom and antishake system makes photo taking a simple operation with outstanding results. My third digital camera and the best I have owned. I heartily recommend it.
1,worse than 3MP Kodak,"I owned the camera for 2 weeks and then returned it.Even though it is very convenient in use, after analyzing the pictures I was very disappointed. Images are not as clear as what my old Kodak 3MP makes. Even when I put it on tripod, still object are blurry, indor or outdoor. Antishake doesn't work perfectly. At least, I don't see any improvements in quality of indoor low light photos.200$ Kodaks better, no reason to pay 400$ for this camera"
2,Dissapointed,"I am very unsatisfied with this camera. I had a Z2 and loved it. I wish I had stayed with it. I have more trouble getting clear pictures with this camera even though it is supposed to have an anti shake feature. After I started using it I had to send it in to get it adjusted which seemed to take forever and should not have been necessary. I will never buy another Konica Minolta camera. I read a lot of great reviews before I bought this one. I am glad those people liked their cameras, but I am looking at other cameras even though I have had this one only about 6 months."
1,It's Dead,"Thouroughly enjoyed this camera and was comfortable using all the features. The zoom was phenomenal. I had no real complaints about the camera until on a trip in Europe the camera just stopped working.I did some reading first online to see if others had encountered the same malfunction, but found a multitude of other issues people were trying to solve. Some of these included error messages, blank LCD screens, etc. My particular problem is that the lens fails to extend, the shutter will not open, the only thing the camera will allow you to do is review previous images saved/stored on the SD memory card. It cannot take any additional photos, and yes new, fresh batteries were installed twice!I think it's bizzare this camera just died within such a short time despite other cameras of lesser quality and durability continue to operate.If anyone has some solution to the problem. Please don't hesitate to contact me through Amazon.Thanks"
1,Product Failure: Lens Block,"I purchased this camera in January intending to use it for an April trip to Hawaii. I've returned the camera twice for warranty repairs for the same problem. In fact, after three months the camera's has spent more time under repair than with me.The problem appears to be a lens block which won't open rendering the camera useless for taking pictures. In the latest fix, I received the camera on Friday after the second repair and error appeared the next day as I was trying to take picures at a daughers event.I'm disappoined in both the quality of the camera and the quality of the warranty repair service."
5,Terriffic Camera,"This camera is a real marvel. So many possible adjustments. I won't go into it as other reviews have covered it well. This thing also sips batteries. My old Olympus killed them in no time flat. I have used this camera for six months on the same set of batteries and even plug it into my computer without an accessory power pack to upload photos. Anti-shake not as great as hoped for, but that is my only complaint about this camera. Honestly, if you're shooting something that requires the 12X zoom, you really should be using a tripod anyway. Powerful and effective flashCan't beat it for the price and I did a lot of research before buying this camera. I do not regret the purchase. I wanted a camera with a high zoom, lots of manual adjustments rather than just a point and shoot, but also capable of point and shoot for my husband to use with ease. This has become our main use camera for everything."
4,Good solid camera,"I picked this camera after reading the reviews and looking for a camera that took regular batteries (4 AA's) since I had a Nikon that had poor battery life and required expensive rechargeables. Solid, feels good in the hand, looks like a camera, and is big enough you won't sit on it or loose it. This camera has an amazing 12X optical zoom, great macro settings, good flash, real camera settings, as well as a auto mode that takes good photos and pre-set scenes for usual situations. It has good image stabilization, and the best video sound in any hand held camera I've ever owned. I'd put it as ""average"" for battery life. Big downside is that this does not record in HD video, nor does it accept the larger modern SD cards. Good camera for taking snapshots of the kids."
3,Don't just rely on this !!,"yes, it is real previous test, but whenever the book mentioned explanation included, i expected full explanation on each one, but it is NOT. they only explain the selective question of one test, not 3 tests, which is kind of disappointed. and they don't teach you the strategy at all, you have to look at the cracking LSAT book for that. All above, the is a subsidary book only."
1,Best Described In One Word,"I just had to write a review for this book, pure and simple this book is GARBAGE. I finished this book thinking what a total waste of time. I kept reading because I was thinking that it had to get better, but of course it never did. Please save your money, because this book is quite possibly the ""worst"" book I've ever read."
4,A Hands-On Look at Life in the Borgia Court,"John Buchard was the ""Master of Ceremonies"" for Pope Alexander VI, and kept an extensive diary of goings-on at the Vatican. Although this book is abridged, it provides a detailed if somewhat tedious and dispassionate look at the papal court. Bouchard puts great emphasis on ritual, ceremonial procedure and diplomatic form, while downplaying court intrigue and the more disreputable activities of the Borgia family. Just the same, the diary gives you a real feeling of this world where religious, political and military power were concentrated in one place, a feeling that can't be matched by latter-day historians."
5,A window into the past,"Always interesting to read contemporaneous accounts that were meant to be private--you pretty much get the real story. As close as we'll get to time-travel.He's such a stiff and cautious writer, that when he flatly describes the perversions of the Vatican you're stunned. How much went on that he let slide?"
4,neat collectible,"I ordered this item for my 9 year-old son who is in the 4th grade. I expected the earth to be actually part of the marble and not on the surface, so I was a bit disappointed. Generally it's a neat piece to display. It even comes with a small metal ring that acts as a stand."
4,"Humility, Perspective, God's Power and Love","I purchased several as gifts for the children in my family ranging in age from 5yrs old to college students. I thought it would be a great lesson in humility, perspective and God's power and love. Looking at this small earth with all the details can help us to keep our problems in perspective. Our issues are very small compared to the vastness of creation- a great lesson especially during the dramatic teenage years. Also, one must be struck by the ""God's view"" perspective. This tiny Earth is even bigger than how it would appear to our Heavenly Father, and though we look as tiny as a speck of dust, He sent His Son to die for each and every one of us. AWESOME!"
4,Contralto GODESS!,"In the world of rare voices and trouser roles, Ewa Podles is quite possibly the MOST underappreciated singer in our generation. Her coloratura is near faultless, and her range of color and tone are something to be reckoned with. Having a range significantly larger than many low voices, she tends to create witty and daring cadenzas and ornaments that must make the golden singers of the past jealous. The only thing that kept this album from being a 5 is that, at times the sound quality is slightly less than perfection and that I prefer her baroque interpretations to the Rossini. Still an amazing album and an unbeatable price!"
4,A Great book on Design and Perspective,This is a nice book with some technical issues that could be better but still a nice book to have for any one interested or that has a career in game design. you should read this book and understand at least a nice outline of how to design a game. you should'nt buy this if you are just starting and have no clue how to design games it is a nice book to try for starters even though there is a chance they will not know what it is talking about.
3,Most certainly not for dry firing,"Although I didn't purchase this product on amazon, I felt compelled to write a review. I recently bought these (at a much, much higher price than I found on here...unfortunately) for my Henry lever action. The dummy rounds worked perfectly for cycling through the rifle, but I dry fired one maybe two of the rounds and I noticed that when I reloaded the rounds that I had dry fired they completely jammed the entire magazine. I believe this to be more of a rifle problem than the rounds, but still if there are any Henry owners looking, DO NOT DRY FIRE! Otherwise those very rounds are completely useless."
3,Not for Dry Firing,"Read the description carefully. As others have stated, these are not snap caps so if you are purchasing them to dry fire your firearm, this is not the product for you. It clearly states on the packaging that dry firing with these ""dummy rounds"" will destroy them after 4 to 5 cycles."
5,Works Great!,I really like these A-Zoom Dummy Rounds. They work great for testing cycling problems with 22LR firearms. NOTE-these are NOT snap caps and will deform if used as such. Recommend!
3,Works fine for intended purpose,"As others have said, these are dummy rounds, but not ""snap caps"". 1 or 2 dry fires will ruin them.I've used them mainly for training and occasionally troubleshooting feeding issues. Works great for those uses."
3,Get chewed up after dry firing,"I bought these to test the feeding of a 10/22 I was building from custom parts. They work great for that. However, when dry firing the rims of these dummy rounds get destroyed. They are made out of anodized aluminum."
2,Does not work well with my plastic GSG 522 magazines,"Does not work well with my GSG 522's plastic magazines. Unlike the real bullet the tail end of these have edges which catches at the top bullet (exit) portion of the magazine which causes pitting in the (plastic) magazine, thus causing these or the real bullets to jam."
3,Good value,I liked the product how ever did not try it but for two months and did see results i was looking for. Probably should have stayed on it longer to give more accurate rating. Price was good. shipped fast.
3,Creatine,Not a bad product.....the 100 tablets only last you about 2 weeks...So I would by 2 bottles but they company doesn't cut you a shipping break on another bottle. Try to find the creatine by Weider....they are good and you get 2 bottles with 150 capsules per bottle for a better price.
2,"Worst of the ""High End"" saws!","I've used a lot of different jig saws over the years. From Black & Decker to Bosch. Have to say that the Freud FJ85 was one of the worst I've ever used.Fairly well made? Yes. That's probably the only reason I gave it two stars. Trigger was mushy, didn't have the ""crisp"" feel of a good trigger switch. Didn't like the blade retention system at all. Bosch and Morse blades both hard to get inserted all the way in the barrel. Cutting guide was so far off it was pathetic.Last of all, during cuts the saw tracked somewhat sideways like a car with a bent frame! Really skimpy manual, too.I've used several Freud tools over the years with good results, but this saw is not a ""keeper""!"
2,Bad blade lock mechanism,"I just returned my Freud FJ85. Sad to do since it was truly a bargain and had a good motor and smooth gearbox. But all of that isn't of much use if you can't get blades to lock properly. I had trouble with the supplied Freud blade, but eventually was able to lock it in. I also bought a variety of Bosch blades. I could lock in some after great effort, but some simply never would fit in. In the end, my fingers were completely cut up. I also didn't care for the lack of dust blower. The Freud comes with a vacuum attachment, but that seemed too awkward for most uses I had planned for the saw. The sight line also left a lot to be desired. I ended up paying more for the Porter Cable jigsaw, but I'm so much happier with it and glad I made the decision quick enough to get a refund."
1,Nice Paperweight,"I probably should have read the reviews first but I couldn't resist the clearance price... I bought my first one 3 weeks ago but found that it wouldn't hold the universal blades so I returned it. I bought another one at a different outlet...yesterday assuming that the more expensive Bosch blades would work. Same problem...the blades won't lock in. You can remove the blade by gently pulling on it. While the price is great, the saw is useless if it can't keep the blade in. After reading more reviews, it looks like Bosch is the best alternative. I'm returning this one today so there will be at least 4 in stock if anyone is interested. Just buy some duct tape to hold the blade in."
1,Worked for 2 minutes...,"I cut one 1""x3"" piece of pine and it quit. I really need to send it in for exchange, but I've been too busy. I better hurry before the exchange policy runs out.Don't buy this!I would have given this no stars if I could have."
4,A very good jigsaw for the $ !,"This is a very good saw. I have worn out three jigsaws prior to this one.I wanted to get a saw that started out at zero RPM's, had orbital action, good power, a quick change blade, a good blade guide system, and used the ""T"" shank blades.I was going to buy a Bosch, but decided on this one instead. It has a better blade change system, very precise switch, and a very strong motor. It has a removable plastic shoe, anti splinter insert, and an allen wrench on board. It doesn't come with a case. I usually chuck them anyway, because they take up too much room in my van. I gave it four stars instead of five, only because it doesn't blow the dust off the cut line very well.Overall, a very good buy at fifty bucks less than the Bosch!"
1,Freud FJ85,"Although appears to be packed with features for the price, this saw is very picky about the type of U shank blades it will work with. Despite using top quality Bosch blades, the saw threw out every blade I was using. Freud stated that saw can use universal blades-- good luck!, threw out a universal blade every time I started to cut. I have to say DO NOT buy this tool,there are many other choices. FYI- Lowes appears to have dropped them from their inventory."
5,Freud Jig Saw,"After making up my mind to get rid of the old B&D jig saw, I decided to move up to a professional grade saw. Read up on the Freud and like the features and price. Have use it a few times and I am impressed with the cutting power. Putting a blade in with the quick changer went smoothly. I bought Bosch blades for it and I'm sure they help take advandage of the Freud's power, cuts very quick. Some vibration to it and the noise level is not too bad. All in all, it's a beast. I like it."
5,Best jigsaw for the money!,"Best jigsaw for the money this jigsaw beats the pants off Bosch for less money. I really like my and plus its made in Spain, not China."
1,Must be better ones,"I have had mine intalled for less than a year, and during the cold weather it will not rotate. That was the reason I replaced the old one. Also, it will not rotate a full 360 degrees, more like 340. The directions do not seem to be correct in that the buttons that are mentioned to complete various tasks do not correspond with the buttons that actually seem to be active. I have not found any place in the instructions for support. There has to be better ones on the market."
3,OK For the Money,"This unit is classed as a lightwieght rotator. It IS NOT suitable for very large Ham antennas or for use in very high (over 50') situations, this is my opinion. That said I am unsing a Wineguard 9095 8' antenna for HD broadcasts and it is not necessary for me to rotate the unit very much. The remote works fine and I recommemd zeroing the unit AFTER you install it but BEFORE you put the antenna on it. Use a piece of white tape with a black mark to see the movement. My only gripe is in the VERY scimpy control wire, it is very thin and should be tossed out and replaced with a more heavy guage 4 conductor wire."
5,Good Value,"Great product for the price. As the manual states, it needs to be reset to zero occasionally after high winds; just a matter of pressing a button on the remote."
2,Nice Try But a Series of Mistakes,"Very good price with free shipping! However: 1.) Free shipping was not included when order was totaled. - Good customer service refunded me the difference - Thanks. 2.) Liked Unit - but - Control unit broke when tried to plug in. - 3.) Contacted Manufacturer for repair options - after many phone calls was informed that Amazon was not an authorized dealer and that I needed to return it to them. 4.) Returned item to Amazon - Fast, curtious, and prompt but a general hassle for something I had wished to have in service. 5.) Informed by Amazon that the item was no longer available though I noticed it on the web site for a $10.00 increase in price! 6.) I guess that Amazon didn't want to honor the old price. 7.) Time and energy spent for nothing!"
4,Remote control has no on-off control over unit.,"The rotor and instructions for installing the rotor and control box were very easy to understand and implement. However, I cannot turn the control box on or off with the remote control. I also cannot find anywhere a phone number for customer support."
5,Lesson of the Vine,"Excellent Book. It will teach how to be taught by God. A must have for every citizen of the Kingdom of God, aka Christians. Only God can reveal his word to you. Carnal Man reads the bible and tries to reason it. This will not work and is the cause for much misunderstanding. The correct way, is to seek God with a honest, open heart, a desire to learn from him. He is very interested in teaching you is word. That's to say, His way of doing things. This book will help you get there. Highly Recommend it. God Bless You."
5,Truly awesome,"If you ever want to find out if things that happen in your life are a form of punishment (Kharma) or see if they are experiences that help you to grow to the next level, then this is the book to read...I've personally read it at least 6 or 7 times and I have given it as gifts as well.Truly awesome..."
4,Explaining the Parable of the Vines,"This book is a fairly quick read that takes the reader through the parable of the vines in John 15. It shows that believers are on one of four levels: no fruit, fruit, more fruit, and much fruit. The author shows how God interacts with believers at each level of fruitfulness. He also explains how our reaction to that interaction will increase the amount of fruit in our lives.I think that different people will read this book in very different ways, but people at all different points in their spiritual journeys will benefit from this book. This book is both very practical and very insightful."
5,The Secrets of the Vine,"This book is excellent. It gave me insight to things I never knew. The book is excellent, the website is easy to use, and delivery was extrordinary."
5,Secrets of the abundant life,"""Secrets of the Vine"" is a sequel to Bruce Wilkinson's best selling ""The Prayer of Jabez"". In this book he uses grapes and vineyards as analogies for our lives and the fruit we are called upon to produce. He tells about 3 ""secrets"" or stages in life where God can intervene and help us to bear more fruit. He details the stumbling blocks we can come across in our Christian life and shows us how God can rescue us in any stage of despair or period of life when we are not bearing fruit. As always, Wilkinson has a way of encouraging the reader to look deeper into himself and shows how we can live life more abundantly in the way God intends us to live."
5,Great insight to John 15,"Provides good insight into John 15, Holy Bible, on how God, through his love, disciplines and Prunes Christians to create a more abiding relationship. Great book."
2,Wilkinson brutalizes scripture,"If you want a feel good book that exemplifies eisegesis, you found it her. The man who is the master of missing the point and imposing an agenda into the Word of God has once again accomplished his purpose. To his credit he makes some good suggestions for abiding in Christ at the end of the book, but he spends the majority of the book ignoring most credible scholars, while affirming that those who don't produce fruit are okay, just wait and the Lord will lift you up. Maybe he won't. Don't allow you salvation to rest or be lost on the teachings in this book"
5,Better than Jabez,"""Secrets of the Vine"" is the better sequel to ""Prayer of Jabez."" Although I found ""Prayer of Jabez"" very interesting and enjoyable, ""Secrets of the Vine"" was more applicable to my personal walk with Jesus. It shows the reader just how vital abiding in the Lord (John 15) is to our relationship with him. In JABEZ, the author shows us how the Lord blesses us, but in SECRETS OF THE VINE, the author shows us how we can choose to live the good life: the blessed life of abiding in the Lord. Every Christian who has a difficult time understanding the passage of John 15:5 should read this book. It's a great tool."
1,As Bad As The Prayer of Jabez,"Both ""The Prayer of Jabez"" and ""Secrets of The Vine"" appeal to greedy, self centered people. One of the greatest weaknesses of both books is their faulty exegesis or reading meaning into a passage of Scripture that isn't specifically stated in the text.In Revelation 20:10 & 14-15 we see that Hell with its lake of fire is most certainly a real place. Bruce Wilkinson's graphic description of hell adds much speculative detail to the several verses the Bible shares with us about this place. As revolting as Mary Baxter's description of Hell is in her book ""A Divine Revelation of Hell,"" Wilkinson's isn't much better. I contend we should stick with what is specifically stated in the text of any Scripture and not add to it. Especially when quoting from a passage in Revelation. Revelation 22:19 warns us, ""And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life..."""
5,Great secrets revealed~,"I learned something new in each chapter of this book. The book is short and easy to read, and will definanly be a blessing to everyone who reads it. The book shows how God cares about each of us, and wants us to succeed! If you have any doubts about God's love for you, this is the book to get!"
1,annoying,"This is the most annoying children's CD we have purchased. After each song is sung, it is repeated by a child. Do yourself a favor and buy Cedarmont Kids Toddler Tunes instead. Just note that they include some religous songs in the mix."
5,Toddler Favorites all 3 CD's available,These CD's were given at same time of the CD player. The songs were great because they were all pre-school songs.
2,"annoying singing, but fun for kids","I bought this CD when my daughter was about 4 months old. Although she enjoys some songs very much, it's almsot painful to listen to some of the singers. They are off key, and are just plain annoying to hear. However, some singers are better than others, and it is thrilling to see my 10-month-old ""bop"" to her favorite tunes."
5,A Great Toddler Music CD!!!!!,"I first came across this CD at our library and after renewing it over and over, I decided to purchase it for my kids. This CD really gets my 3.5 and 2 year old dancing. They love it so much that I have since bought an extra copy to keep in the car for singing along during outings. I would not hesitate to purchase this for your own kids or as a gift!!"
5,She can't get enough,"My 16 mos. old daughter LOVES this CD! We do alot of driving to out of state grandparents and this CD can keep her entertained for the entire trip. Yes...mom and dad know every song by heart and then some, but there is nothing better than hearing her giggling along with the children on the CD!! It is a definite essential on our travel checklist!!"
2,Too folk-y for my child,"I was expecting these songs to be sung in the traditional, school-yard style, the way you would sing them at home. But the singer (s?) put such a folk-like spin on things, my son doesn't even recognize half of songs. I'm not sure if there are various artists, but the woman's voice I hear most often is almost annoying. Very disappointed."
5,My kids love this CD,"We bought this CD for a five day road trip; both of our kids loved it and wanted to hear it over and over again! Fortunately, that wasn't a problem as it is listenable and doesn't get particularly annoying on the 100th go around. Recommended!"
4,My Kids Like It,"My 3 yr old and 18 month old listen to this tape. The songs are familiar (""I'm a little Teapot"" & other nursery rhyme songs)and occasionally children will sing a verse or two. Those are the primary reasons I think they listen to this. The singer's voice really aggravates me, but if the kids like it, react to it, then I can deal with it. Most adults will probably not care for this lady's voice....."
2,Bad and out of tune singers.....,"I was disappointed in this CD. I personally can't listen to it for very long. If you have a music or singing background, you might want to think twice. I love all the song selections, all my favorites when I was a kid. But, the songs are sung by adults (trained singers, all of which have GREAT voices) and then the children start singing in the middle of each one. The children sing out of tune, off the beat and very badly. It's cute for the first couple of songs, but after a while, to the trained ear, it gets REALLY annoying. Babies and Toddlers might like it, because they don't really know or care about musicality. But to me, it was like someone scratching their nails on a chalkboard! eeeek!"
1,Horrible CD,"This CD is painful to listen to. The children they have singing are completely off key and annoying. You can't really sing along with the songs. After one long car ride of playing this for my kids, I had a massive headache. My daughters didn't like it either...we have other children's CD's that are far superior."
1,Worste versions of Favorite songs,These songs are sung out of tune and with weird beats. SOme of teh songs are sung with adults whose voices are terrible and some with mostly kids and thats better.
1,not what it should be,I was very disappointed with the quality of this cd-----the singers were extremely poor. I teach Music & Movement to young children and bought this thinking I could use it for school. Boy was I wrong!!!!! It's one that will definitely collect dust because I would not use it anywhere! My children even told me it (...)!
4,"Nice selection of songs, but the music could be better.","This CD has a wide range of classics and childrens songs you would not expect, such as Happy Birthday. I love the selection of songs and how they try to get you child to sing-a-long and interact. There are however, several different singing voices and my daughter often gets startled by them. The arrangement is also full of drums, bangs and whistles. The sounds can be surprising. The bottom line is- CD is probably best for older kids."
5,Almost subversively silly,"OK, so my 15-month-old looooves this CD. No big surprise. But the dirty little secret is that I listen to it by myself while he's asleep. The arrangements are just so bizarre and silly. I can't decide if ""Wheels on the Bus"" is more of a cross between Hawaiian slack-key and ska, or just plain old country. And ""Monkeys on the Bed"" really rocks out. It's just silly. Yes, sometimes they're a little out of tune, but no more than any of the people you hear on mainstream radio. The only CDs I like more than this one are the Sesame Street Platinum and Platinum, Too CDs (but who could really compare--sesame street is the gold standard). Far better than any of the boring, sweet music on most kids' CDs. I'd rather have willfully silly than dumbed-down any day!"
2,annoying!,"This CD has children singing along at parts and they sound awful. I agree with the others who said it's hard on adult ears. My daughter is only 3 months old, so I don't know if she likes it, but I hope not!"
1,wish I had listened to a sample first,I didn't know my standards were so high until now. I guess I got spoiled with the Disney cds since they are so well done because I just cannot stomach the bad singing on this cd. Even the adult singers are just plain awful! I really wish I had listened to a sample first. UGH! Save yourselves!
1,Annoying,"This is one of the worst CDs that my child has received. These renditions of toddler favorites are truly annoying. It sounds like a bunch of parents and children went into a studio and sang whatever they liked. It might be nice for the singers to listen with their own children/parents, but not for parents and children who want quality recordings. It is so hard on my ears that I may throw it in the trash."
2,"Too Cutesy , Very Annoying","I was very unhappy with this tape. The woman singing most of the songs can barely carry a tune. Way too cutesy and fake happy, it just ends up coming across as obnoxiously annoying. My 1 year old has several other tapes that he really likes and seems to enjoy, including the disney ones everyone is recommending. This one got almost no reaction at all from him. Thank goodness, because I can't stand it!!"
2,Not for Everyone,"I had this cd in my shopping cart and before processing the order I decided to hear some of the song samples they have on the cd. Boy was I happy I did. I will not be purchasing it after hearing clips of the songs. My 2 and 4 year old boys wouldn't sing along to these songs. The way some of the people are singing the songs, it almost sounds like they are making fun of the song by over exaggerating some of the lerricks. Before purchasing, scroll down past the item description to the song samples and listen to some of them before you make a decision since cd's can't be returned after being opened. I saved myself some money!"
4,Our favorite CD for the car,"**Updated to 4 stars vs. 5..only because of the recorded volume. After switching from the CD to the blaring radio several times, it finally got annoying that the volume of the recording is only about 1/2 of what the radio volume is. A little annoying, but still a good CD.**I took a chance and bought this CD for our 9 month old. My daughter loves it! We listen to it everyday on the way to school and on the way home. Sometimes, I find myself listening to it and singing along even after she's out of the car. I love that it includes all of the classics and I like that there are little ones singing along. To me, it makes it even cuter. I would ddefinitely recommend this to anyone with a littl one."
5,Toddler Favorites CD,This was a great purchase. I have a toddler niece who absolutely loves all these songs. She is always wanting to play the music and sing along. Would absolutely recommend.
4,Love it,"The songs on this CD are great, and Will keep child interested to hear more, dance and sing along. My 18 month old LOVES it. It's interactive, though you cannot see anything, which i wish now - that there was a video part to it, since I play it not only in the car but also at home in DVD player"
1,Horrible singing on this CD,"The singers on this cd sound terrible. My kids will not listen to it, neither will I. The singers are really horrible. Buy something (anything) else for your children to listen to."
1,Makes my ears hurt,"I bought this CD because of the great reviews on Amazon. I should have read the bad reviews as well. I thought that it would be kids singing the songs but it's not, it's some woman who sounds like she's gargling. It is absolutely awful!!!"
2,Tone Deaf,"From the moment I turned on this CD, I thought my daughter would learn to be tone deaf. She did seem to like it, but I just couldn't stand it and had to confiscate it."
5,Best Toddler CD Around,"This is my 4 year old niece's favorite cd! It's really a very fun cd, that the adults can also enjoy. The woman singer has a fun style of singing, and blended with the kid voices, it makes this cd a keeper. My niece's favorite songs on this cd are Wheels On the Bus, Where Is Thumbkin, I'm A Little Teapot and Monkeys on the Bed, and I agree, after repeated listenings, these songs really stand out and have a fun sound to them that the kids will really enjoy. Even for adults listening, these songs are very enjoyable to listen to!I highly recommended getting this CD for your little ones, it's a wonderful traveling cd, if you happen to have a cd in your car, it does keep them occupied!"
2,Hard on Mommy's ears!,"I bought this CD because it was a good price. Ugh, do I regret it. As someone with musical training, it's hard to listen the first song, ""I'm a Little Teapot"". The female singer is so out of tune. Fortunately, she is not the only adult singer on this recording. The kids on the recording, however, also sing poorly. I guess some people would find it cute. I only own one other recording of children's songs, Wee Sing for Baby, and I can listen to that one fine (I play it in the car for my son). My son (15 months old) seems to like Toddler Favorites, but as one other reviewer said, if you, the parent, will be listening along with your child, you may not be able to tolerate it. I've listened to samples of the Disney Children's Favorite Songs series, which has been highly recommended by Amazon reviewers, and have added those to my sons' wish list."
2,good songs with bad singing,"The selection of songs is very good. Most are popular and great children's songs that my 2.3-year-old loves. But the singing is mediocre. What's worse is that too many songs are partly sung by children who apparently don't have a sense of tune yet, which means that too many songs were out of tune. If my son sings a song out of tune, I'd probably think it's cute. But listening to other kids sing out of tune over and over again is not fun, it's torture."
1,Unlistenable,"After reading several positive reviews, I bought this CD with the highest hopes of having a definitive collection of children's classics. Upon listening for the first time, my hopeful anticipation turned to disgust. The only thing this CD is a collection of is a cacophonous chorus of out of tune children and a woman trying way too hard to sound like she's having fun. The only redeeming quality of this CD is that our 15 month old enjoys playing with it and tossing it about. There may be other uses for it; however be careful not to let it anywhere near your cd player. I own over 700 cd's; this has the distinction of being the worst.A nice alternative to this kind of music is World Playground. It has children's music from around the world, but sung by professionals. Every song has infectious beats, nice messages, and is very pleasing to everyone's ears."
3,A decent collection of songs for kids,"I wanted to find a CD of songs that my 2-year-old would like (and songs he's familiar with from circle time at daycare) and this is the closest I could find. However, some of the songs have lyrics that are completely crazy (since when do the Wheels on the Bus have singing cats?) and some are just plain wrong. However, my son doesn't seem to care and loves this CD, and he's the intended audience."
4,"Not perfect, but my daughter loves it","Cute songs, nothing particularly cleaver (in my opinion), but regardless my daughter can listen to this CD over and over again. Especially the first Teapot song. There is what I think is an Ausie accent to the whole album, but of course a child does't care. A few of the songs are a bit slow and lose my daughter's attention, but otherwise if I ever lost this CD I'd be dead."
5,your kids will LOVE it.,"i thought i would absolutely HATE this CD when i heard the first song (the singer's voice is terrible!) but it turns out it's the only one that is hard on the ears. my kids ADORE this CD and would request it often. i eventually found myself singing along to a lot of the songs. :) i can almost guarantee if you have a preschooler, they will love this CD even if the parents don't. after all, it's the kids we buy the CD for, right?"
5,Kids songs,"I gave this cd to my grand daughter, because she loves music. Knew very little about it until I received sincere thanks from my daughter and son inlaw for a great CD"
5,Toddler Favorites,"Budget priced cd of singalong versions of many toddler evergreens ( ""old MacDonald"", etc.). Fine and spirited singing. Kids will love this, and parents may like it too."
5,AWESOME,"My 8 month old Granddaughter loves this CD. The songs bring back so many memories for me and my son and daughter-in-law. As soon as any of us put this CD on, she gets really happy and starts dancing and hums along. Its adorable!! On long drives, she gets fussy sitting in her car-seat looking out the back but as soon as my son and daughter-in-law put on the CD, she immediately quiets down and listens to it and starts babbling. So what if the voices are not professional, if they were, it would not relate to children, who this CD was intended for. It also would not be so cute..it would be professional singers singing nursery rymthes. How cute would that be? Why would I pay for that? My granddaughter loves it, thats delights me so I give it a 5 star..."
4,Pretty Good,"Good popular selection of songs with some of them in children's voices. However, there are a few popular songs that are not part of this CD though. Overall, a good buy"
3,good selection of songs,"There are a good selection of songs. My son loves listening to it, but I quickly grow tired of listening to the woman's voice in every song. The kids on the cd have speech impediments which gets annoying. I also wish it didn't have the intros to each song where she talks before they begin, but it was inexpensive and my son likes it, and I bought it for him, not me."
5,GREAT,My three year old continually sings these songs even after the music ends. The singer has a great voice with wonderful inflection and some cute versions to old favorites.
1,Horrible!,"Maybe it was the batch I received or maybe it was just my taste that day, but these are some of the worst nuts I've ever had. They put WAY too much seasoning on them and seem to overcook them to have this slightly burned taste on top of a horrible flavor. If you like intensely flavored nuts...and by intense I mean on the verge of throwing up...then these might be for you. If not, then I recommend you stay away from this product!"
1,Did not work,"The print was bad to begin with, and about quarter way through the movie, everything stopped working.This is not what I expected"
1,Two strikes and you're out,"I bought the Freud FT2000EP in November 1999. In November 2000 the motor failed. Freud replaced it with a brand new one. On October 31, 2001 the second one failed again due to a siezed bearing. Both were used for making furniture in a router table. All precautions and warnings for proper use were observed at all times. It has a one year warranty. Good luck!"
1,"1/2"" Collet defective,...","I received the Freud Router as a gift and a set of Freud 1/2"" bits. The 1/2"" collet was way too small. When I finally got a bit in (w/o the collet nut in place) the bit was so tight I couldn't get it out (Yes I read all the mediocre directions before doing this). After working on it for a couple hours, I finally got the bit out. I ended up scarring up both the bit and the collet. Figuring I must be doing something moronic I took a new Freud bit and the router into a Freud distributor, the distributor ended up getting the bit stuck and had to use channel locks to remove it (yes he scarred up the bit). I returned it ... to get a replacement. ..."
1,Watch out!,"I own many Freud router blades and saw blades which I am very happy with. However, I would recommend that you AVOID this router. If you are mounting the router in a table or using it at a fixed depth (such as along an edge), it works fine. However, it is impossible to make an accurate plunge cut with this router. As you plunge the router you will find that the motor housing and bit will rock sideways relative to the base. This will throw your cut off to one side. The deeper your cut, the greater the error.I assumed my router was defective and returned it to Freud for service -- twice. Both times, however, they sent it back to me and said it was within the tolerances acceptable to Freud. However, these tolerances are not acceptable for good woodworking. I now leave this router mounted in a table and have bought another brand for plunge cuts."
4,First time buyer,"I bought this product based on the reviews here and I was not disappointed. With the 2 bits that I bought along with it, it made making cherry tabletop edge a simple matter. I now am going in search of a router table to go with it. Why 4 stars? It woulda been nice to have a nice case to go with this thing. But for the price? What the heck make that 4 1/2 stars."
1,Warped base!,Right out of the box it rocked like a chair. I sent it right back. I gave it the benifit of doubt with a 1 star rating only because it may have some usefullness as a table mounted router provided quality throughout doesn't follow suit
1,Inferior quality router,"I replaced my Hitachi M12V router with this Freud and was sorely disappointed. Not only is the fit and finish of this product substandard, but I had the same problem as another reviewer in that my 1/2"" bits won't fit into the collet. I assumed that the other reviewer simply received a ""one of a kind"" defective router from Freud, but it looks like this problem isn't so unique. My recommendation: For an extra $40.00 why not buy a router that you can count on working the first time and every time. Its a shame that a company that makes such great bits produces such a substandard router."
1,Its Junk,"This router is without a doubt the worst piece of junk on the market. The screws provided with the router to mount to a router table are a metric size not available anywhere and they are very short. Eventually I got screws from a foreign auto part store after looking for 3 weeks. Much worse, the collet is not actually a 1/2 inch, it is metric in size. This causes the bit not to sit as securely as it should, which can damage the bit and certainly is not safe. I have been working with tools for more than 25 years and this is the worst tool of any type that I have ever used. PASS IT BY for anything else."
1,Runaway from this thing!,"This router at first glance was excellent,but when you but a router to use 1/2 inch bits and they dont fit,it should tell you something.After sending it back for a replacement i recieved another defective router.If i could have recieved one with a collet that was not undersized i would have been happy but after 2 trys still am not"
5,Good Tool,"Pulled this tool out of the box and checked the collet right away. Mine was actually snapped into place already. I chucked up a 3/4 straight bit and set the edge guide, I set it to 5/8 deep and routed out 12 inches of red oak like it was butter. I haven't loaded this unti into my router table yet, but will shortly to make some raised panel doors. I have a feeling this router will throw the panel raising bit with no problem.As for the base, mine is rock steady, sits flat and does not wobble. As for the edge guide, it is not the best in the world, but it does the job very well.This is the best 3 1/4 HP router for under $.... I would suggest this router to anyone."

2,A waste of paper and ink!,"Although the scholarly work, particularly the part regarding 2nd century Judaism and Christianity,is interesting, it mostly seems like sour grapes. Why bother to write a book, or a series of books, explaining how the other guy's religion is all wrong?According to Mr. Brown, Jews are all wrong about Jesus, but so are all Christians except his Jews for Jesus. If you take the New Testament literally, only the Catholic Church should exist! Isn't that the point of the last books?Just leave it alone, Mr. Brown."

It is offensive and pointless for you to categorize it under Judaism.This is a book by and for Chr*stians, to provide them with ammunition for converting Jews.Please recategorize this book under Chr*stianity."
1,Typical fare,"This book is only for die-hard fundamentalists who think these arguments might actually win a theological debate. Nothing new nor original here, just the usual pompous assumptions and hysteria.I agree with the previous reviewer that acceptance is preferable, rather than this infernal and tiresome evangelism. And maybe the person who said do unto others means he would want someone to preach to him about Christianity would feel a WEE bit different if he were being preached to about Jewish or Hindu or Buddhist theology. Sorry, but nobody with a genuine belief likes to have someone else's belief shoved down his throat. Too bad more so-called Christians don't get that idea."
3,Overrated,"Dr. Brown's speaking style is excellent. However his attempt to transfer it to a written text is quite boring at times.The information is probably the best that there is, but has many serious errors of fact, which only someone who is as knowledgable as Dr. Brown is able to find out.(For example: his misrepresentation of the Rabbis dating of the year 4000, where 240 years is reduced to 200.)"
4,Tasty EASTERN North Carolina BBQ,"For those who don't know, BBQ truly means only one thing - pork, cooked real slow and flavored with a vinegar based sauce. Please, don't ever use the word barbeque for a gril or say you are having a barbeque when you are really just having a cookout. King's does a good job of representing Eastern North Carolina BBQ and they ship it fast. We live in Seattle now (2003) and have ordered from Kings our last two Fourth of July celebrations. The BBQ reheats well and impressed all the folks here in Seattle. Order several dozen hushpuppies and keep the toaster oven on to heat them up a few at a time. The only thing King's is really missing is the added flavor of real wood fire. Wilbur's in Goldsboro is still cooking their hogs out back in a pit with real wood. The pig tastes a bit better when it has been slow cooked in a smoky pit. Y'all be good now, ya hear!"
1,WOW,"The only thing that saved this movie, as backwards as it sounds, is the fact its so horrible, you can laugh at how bad it is. The story is beyond dumb. A dude pulls strings to get Beans out of jail, just so he can set Beans up to go to jail? He was already in for a minimum 15 years, but they get him out so they can set him up to go back? You have to see it to believe it!! HORRENDOUS!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Makes Superfly look like the Godfather,"I don't know if this is a movie or a minstrel show.I would say that it's two things Beanie Siegel and Dame Dash pride themselves on when making these retarded hood movies. One is ""keeping it straight hood"" another is sterotypes.There's no need for me say what hasn't already been said about this movie because quite honestly, the horrible quality of this movie speaks for itself.This isn't black cinema it's black death.anyone with the intellect that's over 12 years old will let the ""State"" keep this ""Property"".P.S. What's up with the horrible muti-shot scenes( a bunch of scenes in one shot) near the end of the movie where they are attempting to tie up the loose ends the story( if you wanna call it a story). I guess Damon Dash is the next Quentin Taratino(sarcasm)."
2,A bit deceiving...,"Would have been nice to know that this movie was a former rental, rather than just a normally purchased used DVD. Also, the case was very damaged-plastic ripped, & doesn't really close properly. I wouldn't have paid the same price I had, if seller had clearly & accurately described the product; I probably won't purchase from seller again."
2,Low budget movie got a customer leaving me neurtal feedback!,"What can i say? The plot and a cool back and forth scenes in a Tarantino lookalike chronological order is enough for you to download the movie online or something and not buy instead.I had a customer buy it and he complained it was a bootleg. And i do not do bootlegs at all, so all my personal collection was original. So it was very upsetting to get my ratings low because somebody like to make low budget mess."
2,"Bad directing, Bad acting","What a mess. The fundamentals of acting are gone. You got actors grinning during serious scenes and actors looking into the camera. Not much plot, every 10 minutes somebody gets shot up. A lot of cameos including Mariah Carey, Angie Martinez, Old Dirty Bastard, and Kanye West. I give it 2 stars because of Beanie's performance, at least he tried to act"
1,OMG!!,This movie was horrible!! I liked State property 1 but this next one was so bad!! This was the biggest minstrel show i have seen since theflavor of love!! peace
4,This movie was gangsta!!!,I watched this movie at the theatres when it first came out and it was just simply Gangsta! I thought the acting was average but overall this movie is worth watching!!!! ROC's in the building!
5,Freud SD206 6 Inch Professional Dado,I am very pleased with this dado set. Mine arrived in great shape and cuts very flat bottom dados in solid wood. I haven't tried it in plywood yet.
4,"Nice, but Not the Best Value","I've made hundreds of cuts on this 6"" dado set over the last 5 years.I've been happy, but it's not perfect, and I think Freud sometimes charges for their name when less expensive competitors are about as good. I would tryMibro 491071 6-Inch Stacking Dado BladeorOshlun SDS-0630 6-Inch 30 Tooth Stack Dado Setif I needed another set.The case is well designed. Saves you time, and saves the blades. The red plastic wing nut thingees both cracked, but Freud sent me new ones when asked.It would be nice if the shims were factory labeled. You need to clean, measure, and mark them, and the marker writing eventually wears off.There is sometimes a little blow-out on the cross-cuts, but any dado set will do that. Use a scrap of wood against the trailing edge."
4,"Good, but needs better instructions","Good product - I would have given it 5 stars, but I found the accompanying instructions in very small print and rather vague. Installed on Ryobi BT3100 table saw and made 50 rabbet cuts without a problem."
5,Good Dado Set,"Bought and used on my Ryobi 10"" table saw. It makes nice cuts through oak. I would buy this set again. If you buy a cheaper set, make sure they are rated for the RPM of your saw. This set is rated for a Max 11,000 RPM."
5,"Very impressive, one important note","I was having huge problems crosscutting birch plywood. The wood kept splintering and I could never make a clean cut. I read a review in a woodworking magazine that recommened the SD206 as the best value for the money and decided to give it a try. When I received the blade I tested it out and discovered that if I took small depth cuts, not more than 3/8"" at a time, there was no splintering and the dado was perfectly square. I highly recommend this blade."
4,Works as advertised,"This is a good setup, overall. Tearout in CDX plywood and hardwood is minimal; I haven't yet cut dadoes with it in birch plywood or any other expensive veneered lumber so I can't rate it in that area yet. It doesn't make glass-smooth bottoms in dadoes, but neither does it cost what a Forrest stacked dado head cutter does!"
3,"Nice details but it's not made of Diecast Metal,","I bought this Ghost Rider figure mostly because it stated that it was a Diecast Metal figure. Packaging states that it's Diecast metal but upon inspection it's all plastic. Don't get me wrong, it's well made and has very nice details but it's not diecast metal. That's why I gave it a 3 star rating."
3,plot line was promising but writing was cumbersome,The characters caught my interest and the plot was very promising. However the writing was slow and plodded along. Too many lengthy conversations within the heads of the main characters
3,The Very Best of Kleeer,"I had a vinyl promo copy of ""License to Dream"" which had hit after hit on it. It got damaged and I can not find it on CD. I decided to try this CD since it was supposed to be the ""Very Best"" of Kleeer. The CD is OK but not as enjoyable as album I had. A lot of the songs from the album did not make it to this CD. I rate the CD a three because of this. The other songs which I had not heard before do not compare the the songs on ""License to Dream"". Unless you are are true, true fan of Kleeer, I would not rush to get this CD."
5,Great Pads!,"I purchased these for my 2005 Subaru Outback. These are the OEM pads actually and they rock! Super quiet, great stopping power, little brake fade. Best part, NO DUSTING! I would def recommend this for your Subaru and other vehicles.Pros:OEM QualityGreat stopping powerQuietNO DUST!Cons:Pricier than other options"
5,Good quality pads,"I'm happy with these pads. I paired them withCentric Parts 120.47018 Premium Brake Rotor with E-Coatingon my Subaru Outback, and they're working very well and quietly. Good stopping power with little fade. Better than what was on the vehicle before. If you're not going to the race track, I recommend this combo as a comparable but less expensive alternative to Brembo rotors and Hawk HPS pads."
2,Wood handles are poor.,"The blades on these knives are fine. However, the wooden handles are so poorly finished that, after washing them, I had to sand the handles because they were so rough. The finish is poorly done with what appears to be no sealant. I would recommend looking for those with plastic handles."
2,A different experience from other reviewers,"Unlike some reviewers who state that their spreaders held up well in the dishwasher, mine developed rust spots after the first such washing, and the wood of the handles felt seriously compromised. The metal in the blades is adequately thick, and the feel of the spreader in the hand is acceptable, but not great. I wouldn't recommend this item to friends or family, and would certainly never give it as a gift."
4,good for price,Works fine. I would prefer a slightly more flexible blade for spreading but perfectly functional.The wooden handle looses some of its coloring even when hand washed. Clearly not up to repeated cleaning in a dishwasher but easily hand washed. For the price you could consider it disposable. Run it through the dishwasher and replace it after a few dozen uses.
3,"OK product. Good metal weak handles, but functional.","For the money they are good, but the wood handles is that cheap chineese wood. Great for people who take care of thier stuff, bad for those that have rough kids or teenagers. The metal will last a long time. I would say a good value for the money."
4,WELL USED SPREADER,I use these spreader every day. It has a wide blade and spreads anything easily. I use it to cut sandwiches and fruit. These knifes can also reach to the bottom of an average peanut butter jar which is handy. I use this at home and work. The wooden handles makes it easy to handle. Well made and should last a long time.
3,Not Great but Worth the Price,"Comfortable wood handle, serrated edge good enough to cut through a bagel, and just the right length. I'm not sure about the ""restaurant grade"" claim because they're not all that durable. The biggest problem is that the handles begin to deteriorate right away....they don't seem to stand up well to the dishwasher."
5,Can't go wrong with these,"We use a lot of these type of spreader/butter knives. I've been pricing them outside of Amazon so when I saw the price, I purchased 12 of them. They are just as described and work very well."
3,Stiff spreaders,"The spreaders are considerably stiffer than I expected. Other than that they seem to work fine, although the stain used in the wood handles has faded quite a bit wih several month use."
4,Nice knives,Very nice WIDE knives. They are just too short. Yes it says 7.5 inches and I measured them. They are 7.5 inches. This is still to short. Please see my photos of the knife in a jar of peanut butter. (coming soon)
3,"Love the cost and quality, but not dishwasher friendly","Due to the wooden handle, it is not very dishwasher friendly. I have oiled the handles to help on this, but have found that handwashing is the way to go. It is possible that washing them in the dishwasher is fine, that it just affects the way they look, but i have not wanted to take that chance since i love the cost and quality."
3,Nice Knife But Handles Need Sealing,"I know the danger of wooden handles on knives used for eating when I ordered them. I got the knives yesterday and I finished dipping the handles in plasti-dip twice today. That sealed the slight gaps where the rivets were on the handles and the gaps where the wood meets the tang of the knife. No biggie to me, I always have some plasti-dip around ( you can get it on Amazon ). For eight bucks and a little effort I got four nice spreaders. If your not prepared to seal up those bacteria harboring gaps I'd advise getting other spreaders."
3,"Good Material, Poorly Presented","It is true that this is one of a very few books that actually address the mental aspects of shooting. However, I could not get over the fact that either this book was not edited, or the editor did not speak English.This book is without a doubt the most poorly written book I have ever purchased. The concepts and material, especially relating issues to different levels of ability, is great stuff. The spelling, grammar, and verb tense errors were hard to believe. Someone should take a look at editing and republishing this book."
5,finally threw out the old metal stand,"Our metal tree stand was elderly and assembling the rickety legs and screwing in the bolts was one of the worst parts of Christmas for us. I bought a nice looking one piece Jack Post plastic stand this year, and it has been a huge improvement. The stand is big enough for almost any tree we could fit into the house. The water reservoir holds about twice what the old metal stand used to hold, so there is far less chance of the tree going dry between waterings. I'm quite happy with this item!"
1,Dragon Naturally Speaking Legal Solutions 9.0,Dragon Naturally Speaking Legal Solutions 9.0 is definietly not meeting the intended need. It does not understand any of my words after training many sessions for digital recorders and no better than the default MS Software in MS Word for speech reconigtion. I give it a one star because of the price vs product. I would like a refund.
4,"Decent product, decent price","The sign was shipped very quickly, arrived in almost perfect condition (hey, its aluminum: I bent the warped corner straight by hand) and had no blemishes or flaws. The paint doesn't grip the sign quite as well as I had hoped, but good enough: chipped up a bit where I tightened the screw. The sign is not reflective (at the price, you had to expect that), but it is clean white and black, and easily visible by day or if headlights shine on it. We've got ours by the corner where people turn in to our drive, and it works very well."
5,Great movie to have if you are a Jim Carey fan!,"Great funny and different movie with Jim Carey. The Son of The Mask is funny as well but not like the first one, my kids love both movies. Great for a family movie night :)"
4,Looney,"The Mask: In Edge City, nice guy Stanley Ipkiss, Jim Carrey, gets sssmokin' when he wears the mask of Loki which releases the id that is normally suppressed. Cameron Diaz is in this film and Ben Stein plays Dr. Neuman who has coincidentally written a metaphorical book titled The Masks We Wear. I think Jim Carrey is funny.Son of the Mask: Beyond Edge City is Fringe City. Ben Stein is the only recurring actor in the sequel. It is like a nonanimated cartoon. Jamie Kennedy and Traylor Howard ,of Monk, are a couple who have a son that was conceived while he was wearing the mask. Alan Cummings is Loki who is searching for his mask. This movie is more enjoyable if you can latch onto the sweetness of the family and overlook a few cinematic details."
4,Great fun and laughs,"If you like Jim Carrey then this is the movie for you. It's action filled with fun, laughs and toe tapping music. Stanley, played by Carrey, finds a magical mask that turns him into a character unlike himself. This includes his dog. The second movie 'Son of the Mask' is surprisingly fun to watch. This time Loki, some ancient god of mischief, comes in search of his Mask and that's when the fun begins."
4,Diverse and growing on me in a good way,"You have to admit it is different. There are some good riffs, but seems to be all over the place. Sometimes this is good though. A few tracks (last two) come across like they listened to Becks Sea Change and did cover tunes. I thought their previous disc was very good and rate it a five. I gave this a four because frankly, this is better than most new records out there, though not as good as Worlds.Edit: It deserves 5 stars- I should have listened more."
2,"Dividing, but not conquested.","I had really liked Source Codes/tags whatever its called, and love World Apart, and was expecting more of the same from ...Trail of Dead for So Divided. I was sadly mistaken. Its just so popish. The last two albums were dark and heavy and full of screams and guitar riffs and well good stuff.This, not so much, to borrow the phrase. It seems like somethig a 14 year old girl would listen to whenshe decides that divorce Britney is no longer cool. Fells like something that would play at a prom, or maybe it is meant for regular airplay, but not thier live shows. Im not saying its BAD, but if you wanted a similar feel, its just not here. Fans may want to sample the tracks to decide for themselves before plunking down the $$$, and new listeners should consider some of the earlier, and BETTER works.I can only wonder if the title is intentional, as this disc will alienate some fans."
1,Too much piano makes everything sound like The Beatles,"The parameters around trying to write something new with piano as a main driving instrument is far too narrow for anyone to come up with something original.. Thus every song, written with piano sounds like something stollen from The Beatles and/or Elton John.Dude, you want to make a piano album? Go solo..My early assessment is that they've kept the typical melodies, but decided against using guitars or vocals to play 'em thus making the whole album sound like they're the aged Beatles regardles of their original intent.Trail of Dead, my favourite band.. is Dead.. I know this by the trail..If you realy liked Source Tags and Codes, don't buy this album. If you realy liked Worlds Apart, you might like So Devided.As it is, as a fan, I'm torn between supporting TOD and owning this album, or sending it back to them, asking for my money back. ...So devided indeed."
4,Great Album in a time of American Idol garbage,"I can understand if this album didn't live up to the expectations of some, but give me a break. Out of all of the uninspired mediocre music out there this is truly a great album. Keep in mind though that I also thought ""Worlds Apart"" was phenomenal. So spare me your purist TOD mantras. Sure the songs are different from earlier works but they are all unique and strong in their own way. ""Wasted State of Mind"" is one of the greatest songs I've heard in years. Worth the investment and time.Enough said."
2,So Disappointed,"Loved Source/Tags.Loved Worlds Apart.Not everybody else loved the latter, though. And it seems that rejection has caused TOD to wildly overreact, by doing a middle finger flip to its critics and embracing the theatrical tics and less rockin' moments some disliked on Worlds Apart, and using such tics and moments to populate an entire album. The result sounds like a Roger Waters solo effort (not a compliment).TOD made a fatal error here: Changing their band's sound and then writing mediocre songs. You can't do both."
4,What's all the fuss?,"This is unmistakably a TOD work. There's a little ""Source"", there's a little of the last CD, there's a radio-friendly pop tart, there's a GBV cover, and there's even a song that sounds like it escaped from a Shins CD. Taken as a whole, it's TOD going where they want to go, experimenting a little, enhancing a little, making all kinds of noise over here, being a little softer over there. I think it's a nice CD."
4,So Divided so mellow,Certainly one of Trail of dead's gentler more melodic endeavors. More Piano and some distinctively Beatle's style tracks. Still a great album by a largely unappreciated band by much of America who have not had the opportunity to enjoy their earlier releases.
2,It's a two person job with this contraption.,"I agree with the other reviewer: the connection tube does not fit the receptacle on the spray-can securely enough for this to work. Whoever designed this should be fired. Nevertheless I give it two stars because the concept is valid, and I still hope if I can get an assistant to hold the spray can, it can work.Addendum: I was able to get an assistant to hold the spray-can with the connection tube and we were able to get the system to work. So with two people the system does work. Even so it's best on a relatively clean chain. A really dirty chain needs to be soaked in solvent."
2,3-hand operation,"Requires three hands to operate because the force of the lubricant pushes the tube out of the spray head, so it takes one hand to crank the pedals, one to press the spray tip, and a third to hold the feed tub in place."
2,Just Another Run-of-the-Mill Sales Book Riding on the Sun Tzu Franchise,"I read this book with high expectations that a lot of people equate business/ selling with warfare, and I'd like to see if someone can actually draw the correlation.Unfortunately, while there are a lot of tips on selling, which could have been covered within Selling 101, there is minimal coverage on Sun Tzu's military strategies here.The book cover also mentioned abt Customer Relationships, which is not substantially covered in the book as well. I guess by marketing it as what it's not, it's bad for customer relationsips too!"
4,A good compromise,"Freud's ""Safety"" Dado blade set is a pretty good compromise between the more expensive stacked sets and cheaper offerings. The high shoulder of the anti-kickback design really seems to work - I've had no problems. A nice choice for hobbyists like me (just wish I could find the shim set...)."
2,Not for precision work,"I am not very happy with this dado set. The flatness of the resultant dado, where not great, is acceptable. The main issue is that it chips and splinters. I am forced to pre-cut the sides with my Forrest blade, then install and line up the dado set. Given the hassle of switching blades, the dado usuallly just stays on the shelf.A friend has the cheaper Freud dado set and it performs better. If I had it to do over, I would spring for the next model up or a Forrest."
4,hoping it lives up to everything it says,"impressed with picture, mine included a game pad w/large number of games preinstalled. sound is a little lacking in bass; but with earphones you are overwhelmed w/great sound. If you listen to the sound w/o earphones the best sound is further away from you. Will be taking it on a trip to Hawaii. Hope it continues to function well."
5,"GREAT 8"" Polaroid Portable DVD Player","This is a great compact unit that fits nicely on the tray table in an airline seat. Or use it when camping or let children use in the car on long trips. There are Dual Headset Jacks so two people can watch and listen to the movie at the same time. If you have two kids on a long trip, that will give you some quiet time as you drive. You can view the screen while it is in the carrying case and the case has straps so you can attach to the seat in front of the viewers. Or it can be played sitting on a table and the screen swivels for easy viewing. The picture is superb - - crystal clear and sharp picture."
1,Try another brand,"Initially bought this in July 2004. It worked fine for just over a year. Then it quit working (DVD would just spin & try to read, but no go). Called Polaroid & they invited me to send in the old unit at my expense along with $50 for a replacement (an out-of-warranty replacement), which I did. They sent back a newer model of the same player, which again lasted slightly over a year. Soo... I think it's time to try a new brand. Assuming Polaroid still offers the same replacement deal, I figure I get a $60 model of some cheapy brand and if it makes it at least a year, I'll breakeven and I won't have to make a trip to the post office and wait several weeks for the replacement."
1,Swivel screen shorts out.,"I bought the Polaroid because it had a swivel screen and advertised three hour batterly life. WITHIN 2 DAYS of buying it the screen was starting to flicker. Within a week the only way I could see an image on the screen was by twisting the screen a bit (like a potato chip). I'm taking it back today.By the way. The unit comes with a case, but the battery pack will not fit in the case with the player. Oops!Looking at the warrentee card, it only comes with a 90 day warrantee. I'm not risking my money with another one. I'll shop for a more durable model."
1,Polaroid PDV-0820T Not Good,"I went through 2 units both with the exact same problem. After about 2 weeks of use the LCD won't display and it will not play movies. I was finally convinced not to get a third when I went into Best Buy and their display model was exhibiting the same identical problem. They are obviously to me, faulty by design. I was really high on it's features and the swivel base, but very disappointed in the technical quality. Spend the extra $$ and get a different brand."
1,A waste of money!,"I bought this for Christmas (less than a month ago). If you touch the lid at all while its playing, it shuts off and makes you restart again. After 3 weeks, it stopped working altogether! I can't even turn it on. Polaroid is of no use and now I'm stuck with a $240 doorstop."
1,Frequent Quality Issues,I am now on my third unit since my initial purchase two months ago. The first unit had problems with the LCD screen. The second problem had problems with the audio connections. Let's hope the third unit works.Spend the extra money and get a better quality player.
2,Don't buy a DVD from a camera company!!,"After spending about $300 for this in October 2004, I was disappointed when the power cord stopped staying in place. Unfortunately, I waited too long to report it, so it will be cheaper to buy a new unit than have this one repaired. Also, even though we did not use the battery very often, it will no longer hold a charge (not even a minute). No more Polaroid electronics for me."
1,Both did not work properly.,I bought this one for my daughter. The first unit broke after the first use. The screen would not show anything. I exchanged for another one. The second one kept saying that the door was open and rebooting the movie from the start. This was the first time I used it. I returned it to the store for my money back.
1,RUINS DVDS!! Do not buy this product!,The car adapter cord started coming loose after only a few months of use. Which means the movie stops and has to be restarted by jiggling the cord (VERY upsetting for a small child!) We finally solved this by leaving the battery pack in even while it was plugged in (which the product advises not to do as the battery has a memory.) Then we discovered that the Polaroid had been ruining our DVDs! There are circular scratches on them. My husband tried to salvage them by copying them onto a new DVD but many of them he could not save. The DVDs will only play part way and then the screen starts getting stuck. We have also had issues with error messages from the Polaroid thinking there was no DVD in or that the door was open to the DVD player. This product only has a 90 day warranty - I think it is quite clear why they don't warranty it longer!
1,Polaroid is not worthy,"These Polaroid DVD players are not worth the money unfortunately.Went thru two units with swivel screen.First broke on intial use. Second unit lasted exactly 5 uses, when the hinge snapped as it was being closed, (very gently I might add, since these things feel like they will fall apart in your hands.)The cheap plastic facing surrounding the screen also split in two when the hinge broke. Polaroid units may possible be rebranded Malata's as I saw the exact same models in Shanghai in December sold as Malata's.If you are willing to live with the risk of it breaking on you, on the plus side, battery life really was excellent (altho the battery is very large,) and the screen quality was very good compared to more expensive models.Your mileage may vary of course, but if you are making the investment, consider spending a bit more for a real name brand, and avoid Polaroids.Got myself a Samsung, which is just awesome"
5,So far so good,"I've had this unit for almost a year. No complaints as of yet, and I use my unit weekly. The picture is awesome! and although the sound could be better, I just invested in a couple of good headsets and it sounds pretty awesome. If you don't use any, you'll need to have the room/area perfectly quiet and be sitting real close to be able to hear everything, so invest in a good headset. Other than that, my unit has been fine with no problems."
2,"Nostalgic? Sure, but what's it supposed to mean?","I suppose the other nine volumes in the set are like this too. Where's the methodology? Just hit-and-miss extracts interspersed with tediously repeated opening and closing theme footage. Oh, well...."
1,"don"" go there",I thought I was getting some cool old memories. Instead I got an advertisement for Disney. I remember Spin and Marty... Mochie...cool cartoons...I saw none of this.What's a fan to do????
4,Very sharp grooves,"I just bought this dado set and used it to mill about 15 1/2"" dados in red oak. At first I had to check to make sure I was cutting. This set is almost as smooth as my Forrest WWII! The dados were very sharp with perfectly flat bottoms. No shims were required. Although a lot of money, I think it is well worth it. Better to buy a great product once than a poor one first.My only complaint is that the shims are not coded in any way. Would be nice to see some color coding for thickness. If not for that, this product would get 5 stars."
4,great dado set for cabinetry work,"This my third Freud blade and I agree with all the reviews about how clean and smooth the cuts are. The quality of this blade is excellent! The case is plastic and uses dimpled plastic to separate the outer blades and chippers so there are no damage to the carbide tips.Once you use the right combination of chippers per the chart, it cleanly and easily cuts through oak to particle board. No chipping or tear out.The only improvement to this dado blade would be to stamp the chipper with its thickness. Otherwise it is a very good purchase."
4,Well worth the price,"Freud is known for a quality product. Working a lot with projects I am happy with paying for the SD model. It delivers a crisp clean cut as promised in the Super model.I use a portable Table saw which restrictes me to a 6 inch blade, instead of a 8"" inch. I also have to keep with a traditional dado. Really, once you start to use this set. Freud makes it simple even with shims U can tell its well thought out and put together tool. I would have to say the only improvement, thus far is the case it comes ion could be little less generic in design, but then again its not bad and makes the set more affodable. Also, Amazon makes it easy on the sweet price and delivery as usual!"
3,Some disappointment...,"Just bought the 6"" stacked dado set, and have been not pleased with the unevenness of the bottom of the slot cut. Even in my zero-clearance throat plate, the slot cut is uneven - the blades apparently aren't stacking true to yield a flat bottom to the slot. Oversized holes for the arbor???? I will be further experimenting to see if this can be remedied. Other than than, the set appears to be well-made, and the shims allow exactly matching the slot to get a tight fit to the mating lumber. The carry box is handy - but the quality of the plastic used for the box is questionable, and I wonder how long the box will last before cracking and disintegrating."
2,Adjustability Bad,"Having recently purchased a FT2000, I bought the Edge Guide attachment as well, Out of the box, the finish appeared good, but when I tried to actually run the adjustment nut in or out, I realized something was wrong with the fence, it WASN'T seated in the slot, it was riding on top of the slot. This was due to the fact that the fence is stamped steel, not cast aluminum or something similar. After an hour with a file, I ground down the edges of the fence where they fit tightly into the slot in the guide it was designed for. While it works well enough now, I'll be buying a Micro Fence soon. By the way, the router itself is great! Added 5 days later: The fence is suprisingly tight afterI filed it down. I approached a piece of hickory today with the router/fence combination, and to my suprise, it held up to the task, but I'll still buy a micro fence within a week."
2,Freud FT2010 Deluxe Edge Guide,"BEWARE! I purchased a FT2000E a couple of months ago, and recently bought the FT2010 Edge Guide attachment. Although the finish appeared fair, the fence would not seat in the slot, it was riding on top of the slot. The fence is stamped steel, and does not contain the black attachment on the fence shown in the picture. I ground down the edges of the fence until it fit and slid easily in the guide slot. While it works well enough now, the defect does indicate poor quality control by Freud. If I had bought it locally I would have taken it back to the store but it would have been more trouble than it was worth to send it back to Amazon."
5,Great!,"We try 4 cordless phones before this one, and they always had problems. Finally we decided to buy the simplest, and we bought this Sony. IT WAS GREAT! We have had it for 2 years, and it is really the best. It is a shame Sony doesn't do phones anymore. They are REALLY GOOD."
5,What are you people talking about?,"I recieved this phone as a Christmas gift. I have never had a problem with it. The volume I thought was actually a little louder than that of a Uniden that I presently own. And the ringing options are just like ones that V-Tech uses. Maybe it's because my phone is the SPP-N1004. The only difference is that mine is blue and silver. But I find this phone to have a great talk time, and has even been better than A V-Tech 900Mhz digital phone that I used to own."
2,Does NOT have hands-free operation,"The technical specifications for this product and the description in the reviews section say it includes the ""Sony Street Smart Headset"" and that it supports hands-free operation. The product shipped to me - SONY SPPN1000 - does not have this feature - not even a jack for a headset. It probably is a fine cordless phone, but hands-free it is not!"
2,brought it back,"It made at funny sound ,off and on .Good sound when not making sound . Brought it back."
5,AT last the film that made me scared of Dolls as a kid is finally on DVD,"My older cosin rented this one night when she was babysitting me i was like 9 or 10 and i remember her saying to me wanna watch a scary movie, i said sure ok. And what she stuck on was Dolls, i couldn't sleep for weeks and anytime i saw Dolls they creeped me out and i thought they were gonna kill me, to this day dolls creep me out i cant sleep in a room with dolls in it espessialy those porslin Dolls like in this flick, and i have this flick to thank, now thats a movie!"
1,Terriable Movie IMHO,"All right I know everybody loves this movie and what not,but i've seen it and i love horror movies but i just can't stand this movie it's absolutely horrible,the little girl was horrible even though she was younger.but then again think of a young Dakota Fanning.The dolls were just stupid and the dad was actually a likeable character in a way. I think the one hooker should have lived instead of being killed off. Don't be mad it's just one guys opinion.Jake"
3,They're Killer Dolls!!!!!!,"Having Seen DOLLS on a number of occasions...I recommend this only to fans of the ""Killer Doll"" genre. It is a very mild horror film that could probably be rated PG-13 instead of Rated R.It has it's moments...but most of them are laughable!!"
4,dolls dvd,"a good movie, i always liked this movie! i watch it every time it comes on tv. good, good, good."
3,Fun '80s Horror,"""Dolls"" (1987) is surprisingly good for a low-budget horror film. I was expecting the movie to be very similar to ""The Funhouse"" (1981)--teenagers looking for a place to copulate, characters who are little more than knife fodder, etc.--but the movie was much more moral in tone. (If you like E.C. comics, such as ""Tales from the Crypt"" and ""The Vault of Horror,"" you'll enjoy ""Dolls."" The same type of hyper-morality is at work in both.)A bad father, a bad stepmother, and a good daughter get stranded near a mansion in the English countryside. The house is owned by a strange old husband and wife who make dolls. They are soon joined by two Madonna-esque rockers and the nice man who gave them a lift. The dolls, of course, come to life and dispense harsh judgment upon those who deserve it.The movie was surprisingly clean, with only scattered profanity and no sex or nudity. There are a few gory moments, and I suppose the R-rating is deserved for those."
3,Dolls are scarey,"This movie is great. It has everything you could ever want.Dolls [Aggggggh, they're alive!!!!]An evil Stepmother [Boo!!!]A mean daddy [Bad!!!!!!]A little girl [Aw]A nice fat man [what a sweetie]An older couple [aw, again]And two british hookers dressed like Madonna [Har de har har har]Guess what the dolls do? They kill everybody who is mean. I wish they worked for me."
3,How to make a B-Movie Cocktail!,In a creepy old house with two weird old people mix:1 part Evil Stepmother1 part Pushover Dad1 part cute naive kidStick this little family concoction into a thunderstorm then add:2 skanky punk rock girls1 childish young man with an unhealty obsession with toys.Sprinkle in some bad acting and there you have it! A B-Movie that's fun to watch with your friends and will get lots of laughs! Also for a little extra flavor make sure you have some bad gore effects and cheesy killing dolls! Enjoy! I know I sure did.
4,Are you a child at heart?,"This movie is fun stuff! Six people get ""caught"" in a storm and end up staying the night at a house in the middle of nowhere's. Of course once it's bedtime for the guests it's playtime for the dolls. If you're a fan of the horror genre you'll regret missing out on this gem. Great kills, scares and even some laughs. If you can find it check it out!"
4,Perfect for the price,"This dado kit is flawless if you have a nice size table saw and know what you are doing. If you work with crappy wood, or try to cut too much at one time, you will encounter problems. But if you have researched how to make nice dados, this tool is well worth the price."
4,Nice Blade,"I just put this through the paces rabbeting (yes that's how it's really spelled) several drawers I installed under the bed (much to my wife's delight). Very accurate and well made blades. One word of advice: the blades and wing chippers cut 1/32"" light of their stated width. I think this is because plywood is is 1/32"" light of its nominal thickness, ie 1/2"" plywood is actually 15/32"". So this is actually a good thing for cutting grooves for plywood. To actually get 1/2"" thickness, add two of the shims supplied with the blade. The nly reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that the directions don't give you this handy tidbit, I figured it out with a test cut and some research."
3,Chipped teeth!,"The set I received had numerous chipped teeth. I looked at several sets on the shelf at Home Depot and all of them had a few blades and/or chippers with chipped teeth. It looks like Freud has a quality control problem. If you buy one, be sure to inspect the teeth. After all, why should I settle for a defective product when I've paid full price for a brand new one?"
5,Smooth finish!,This dado set is as good as described by all the readers. Also it is very easy to install and remove the blade. A caliper will be a handy thing to have when using this stacked set.I don't want to repeat the good things that all the readers have already mentioned.
5,Good choice,"Have not used the product yet, but I expect it to perform as it should. I bought it on reputation alone after reading many reviews about various dado sets."
5,The Ultimate Dado Set!!,I have wanted this dado set for a long time now and finally saved up enough to make the purchase a few weeks ago. One of the best purchases I have made for my woodshop. Superior quality....packaged perfectly for storage...highly recommended!!
4,Adequate dado blade,The glad is even and smooth for the past month of use I will continue to use and update my status.
2,Ruined my Arbor,"On this otherwise very good blade, I have a serious problem. I gave it 2 stars because it cuts very good. The problem is that it advertises itself as a 5/8's arbor. It is so tight that it ruined the threads on my Delta Professional table saw. I now have to buy a new arbor ($65 from Delta), plus I have to take my table saw down to fix it + plus I have to buy another dado blade. Don't buy it.--S"
3,Cut Width Misleading...,"I'm frustrated with my new Freud SD208 DADO, but mainly because the instructions for setting various widths is so misleading. I had to review all 19 ( current ) reviews before seeing someone else mention this. The core problem was that I had cut my own lumber; so 3/4"" was REALLY 3/4"". The setup instruction assume you are using store bought lumber which is always slightly less. This is obviously good for most buyers, but I'm now stuck with finding someone with a micrometer, measuring and marking all shims, then figuring out which shims to use to add the 1/32"" that I'm missing! Ugh...Now that I've vented, I would probably have the same issue no matter what DADO I bought, so the SD208 really is a good value."
2,Save your money and buy the Super Dado!,I was very dissatisfied with this dado set. I bought mine at a local home improvement store. It claims it cuts square dadoes but it does not. The outside cutters make deeper cuts on the outside. I took it back and I am saving to buy the Super Dado or Forrest's Dado King. Until the I will use my router with a straight bit for my dadoing needs.
2,Disappointing,"I recently bought this dado set for a cabinet project. I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the cuts. The sides of the cuts were very smooth and accurate, but the bottoms of the cuts were very uneven - even worse than simply using a 1/8"" saw blade to make repeated passes. I'm using this set on a new Ridgid 10"" table saw and the fit on the arbor is extremely snug, so a loose arbor fit isn't the problem.For hidden dados where appearance or flatness isn't critical, this set is fine. But if you need smooth, even bottom cuts, like for tenon shoulders or exposed rabbets, this blade set isn't up to the task... you're better off using a router or tenoning jig."
5,Price,Lowes carries this item in stock for their everyday price of $94.97. With tax it would be a little higher but the ability to pick it up the same day instead of having to wait sometimes up to a month for delivery with Amazon's Super Saver shipping it's well worth it.Amazon should lower the price to make it more competitive overall. But if you don't have a store near you and aren't in a hurry - Amazon is the way to go.
4,performed as advertised,"I have recently purchased and used this Freud Dado set with very good results. My concern was over my underpowered Craftsman table saw. The blade performed well and made crisp accurate cuts with no sign of bogging down my saw when cutting hardwoods. The case is of surprisingly high quality. Along with other reviewers, I found some cuts to measure small, but easily corrected with the included shims. ..."
3,Disappointing results,"In attempting to make some tenons, I thought the dado might be an expedient shortcut, so purchased the Freud at a local store; (why not start with a top brand?!) Surprised that I was unable to cut a ""flat bottom dado"", I returned it to the store, where the manager agreed it must have been defective. It happened again. I'm now using the third set of Freuds, and the closest I can get to a flat bottomed dado, is by hand filing the high spots with a diamond file, after measuring each blade tooth. Kinda disappointing, considering the overall apparent quality of their product: nothing cheap or flimsy; heavy duty blades, with an apparent fit and finish right at the max. Perhaps I got some of a bad batch?"
4,Very Satisfied,"I bought my dado set at Home Depot (I work there) I had always wanted a good stack dado set, but could not see paying in excess of $150.00 for something I only occassionally use. I am glad that I waited for this set. My current project, a computer desk has made good use of this set. No problems with set ups and the cuts are razor sharp. The only improvement I would suggest is to mark the shims as to the thickness."
4,"No issues, just wish things were labled a little better...","I found the dado's made with this blade were great and square enough for this woodworker. The only issue I have is with the non lableling of the different spacers...I should lable them myself, but...but...but...I procrastinate! Otherwise, it's great."
3,Cuts good Dados but didn't fit arbor well.,"I purchased a Freud Diablo dado (professional dado) for my Grizzly contractor saw and it went on the arbor a little snug. I didn't think anything of it until time to remove the blade and it would not come off without removing the arbor from the saw and knocking the arbor out with a block of wood ruining the bearings in the process. All my other blades fit as well as all the chippers and one of the outside blades of the dado set. Freud replaced the set after I had to pay for return shipping but the new one seemed tight as well and I did not want to risk having to disassemble my saw again. I returned it to the store I bought the original set from. I may look at the Super Dado instead or the Forrest dado. I cannot speak highly enough of Grizzly though, they replaced my chewed up arbor and bearings free of charge."
5,Great work...,"This is a great commentary series on the Psalms and has the same feel as Spurgeon's sermons. Great resource for any teacher and pastor to prepare in study for the Psalms. Very detailed, which I can't say the same for other commentaries done during this same time period.The price once again shows how many people have lost interest in both commentaries and our past church saints.If you are going to be going through the Psalms in your own study or teaching you should definitely have this at your disposal."
3,Abridged Version.,"This is the abridged version. It is incomplete, We would be better served by having the complete version. This is not what we thought it would be."
5,The Treasury Of David,Very insightful and thought provoking. An excellent resouce book on the book of psalms for both personal study as well as sermon preparation.
2,So So...,"After reading Broken Hearts, I have come to the conclusion that there is usually a really darn good reason some books only get printed by a small press. Read this thing and you will understand. Predictable, unbelievable, unrealistic. The dialog was attrocious. Take a pass on this one."
4,"A good quick, easy read","Having lived in both Charlottesville & Memphis, I enjoyed Levy's descriptions of places I was familiar with. This is a good, quick, easy read."
2,Kind of yukky...,I didn't like the taste at all. I (barely) got through the box and won't be ordering again.
2,no real point to getting this book,"too dense and without any useful and detailed pictures, the book is not a great tool.Positives are that there are plenty of multiple choice questions to practice with.rarely do I use this while in medical school"
4,"Great review, needs pictures",Great review for the USMLE Step 1. Good price. I think it could use more pictures. Good organization and with useful details. If you are going to get this book you should get an Atlas (Netter is the best). A good buy.
4,From The Introduction:,"The only problem with this book is that it's a little bit dated.This book is a complete portable pack of all the infor,ation most photographers are ever likely to need. This working manual is the distillation of years of professional experience into a form which can readily be understood, both visually and verbally. It aims, quite simply, to present the essentials of photography in compact and usable form. In easy-to-follow sections, every practical aspect of indoor and outdoor photography is covered in a variety of situations, demonstrating how the best results can be achieved."
4,"Good CD, Great price","I originally bought this CD because of its great price. It is by no means as great as the moving recording done by the London Symphony Orchestra with Britton conducting, but it is a good second choice. In some sections I thought the balance was a little off, and the solo tenor can hardly be compared to the marvelous voice of Peter Pears, but if you're looking for a cheaper recording then the London Symphony one this CD is quite adequate."
4,Terriic performance,A very rewarding listen. The soloists are particularl good. They know who sangs these parts originally and they've grabbed the baton of the legacy and ran with it superbly. The original premiere recording that I have on cd with Britten conducting had a lot of 60s hiss in the sound. Perhaps the remastered recording took care of that. This recording's sound is excellent. Wonderful performance.
4,visual atlas of needle insertion,"This is a visual atlas showing needles inserted into each of the acupuncture points on the 12 Meridians, and the Du and Ren vessels. Some of the Extra points are also included. It's a good reminder for needle angle and depth of insertion for those who want a visual guide - there is full nudity, by the way, for those points (such as Du 1 or Ren 1) which are in areas normally clothed."
1,Not happy,"This is the worst TCM book that I have purchased thus far in my academic career! There are lots of editing mistakes. I haven't been able to go through it with a fine toothed comb because the obvious mistakes are so irritating. Was really excited to have a point location book with pictures rather than illustrations...in my opinion, stick to Deadman or Cam. I wish I could return this book to the publisher!"
3,"Percussion and drum-fest, marching band, militaristic","If you are fascinated by percussion like I am, you will surelylearn to appreciate these very entertaining and well recordedperformances.In fact, several numbers sound overall as quite militaristic,in matters of the robust and beautiful accentuation of thebass drums, coupled with the parade-style mood of severalpassages.Also, the opening number STENKA RAZIN shows a catchy melody,that is upbeat, albeit simple.The numbers are well balances, never repetitive or boring,and is guaranteed to keep the listener entertained for wellover 45 mins."
4,project manager,I've found nothing better for removing tile grout. We can clean at least 10 standard tile tub surrounds with each blade - more or less. About $10 a surround. I'd like to know if something better (faster and longer lasting) exists.
5,fein diamond tile blade,My carbide blade was destroyed after one wall of a tiled bath tube surround. The diamond blade did the other two walls and cut tiles as well and looks good as new.
3,Answer to Joe's question about alternatives updated 05/12,"The diamond blade was about $100+ when I wrote the first review. Now the price is more reasonable. I have the tool, and have used the carbide blade. It works great! I would buy the diamond blade at the current price. Amazing how a little competition can drive pricing."
1,Empty Package,I just ordered this $54.88 diamond tile grout blade. I received an empty package with no blade. Good job Amazon - you stole my money and now give BS on the return...
1,Horrible Quality!!!,"What can i say? I tried to save money on a car phone charger and got burned. Luckily i didn't literally ""get burned"" by this poorly made horrible product. While charging it gets so hot that it would burn you if you held it the whole time. It also stopped working after the first use. You get what you pay for people. Don't be a cheapskate like me!!"
5,Great naval History of these ships,I was really proud of these DVDs. It lets you know about what these ships went through during their days of activeness while serving our great nation. And what it took to fight on the oceans.
3,Average,Hero Ships is average documentary. I expected more as in Battle 360. Or even the Dogfight series. Will pass on any more in this series.
4,The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries - Season One,This dvd The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries - Season One came quickly. I am enjoying watching it.
3,it was cool back in the day,i use to watch this show back in the day. it was cool in a made for Tv Scobby Doo minus a Detective Dog&Crew vibe. there Mysterious always got solved. it was a cool lite type of show.
5,What Fun!!!!,"I Have To Say I Never Really Watched Much Of The Nancy Drew Shows When They Aired...But Really Enjoy Them Now, I Have Even Watched Them More Then The Hardy Boys...Both Shows Are Great, Wonderful Casts And Lots Of Fun!!! I Can't Wait For The Next Season!!!"
4,"Great Mystery, Great Television","I loved watching the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries as a kid and I loved watching these DVD's today. It brought back great memories. I swear that you could see star burst everytime Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson smiled. Pamela Sue Martin was great as the ever curious Nancy Drew. I loved these episodes but I am concerned about season two. There is a ""King Tut"" Hardy Boys episode that I truly loved which is in Season two not to mention a combined Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew episode at Dracula's castle where we see a love interest between Frank Hardy (Parker) and Nancy Drew (Pamela Sue). After Season two Pamela Sue Martin left the show for Dynasty but the shows were priceless while she was still a part of them. Please release Season Two!"
5,Hardy Boys,The whole family has thoroughly enjoyed the Hardy Boys and Nanacy Drew. I hope season two will be available. It's fun to see some familiar faces from the 70's.
2,Not as good as my youthful mind remembers,I was rather disappointed in season 1. I never missed this show on TV and thought it was the best but what does a kid know? It just does not hold up after all these years. My husband and I were bored stiff watching these episodes. I would not recommend this to anyone unless like me you were obsessed with Shaun Cassidy back in the day. (I took my 3rd grade pictures in a tshirt with him on it). However I think we have all grown up and this just doesn't have enough to interest adults today.
5,Memories Of Playing Detective!,"I am in my early 30's, and this was my favorite show of all. Every Saturday night I would watch Frank, Joe, and Nancy solve their mysteries. Then my sisters and I would pretend to be them and solve our own ""mysteries"". I also read all of their books when I was a kid. I have been waiting for several years to see if they would be released onto DVD. Thank goodness they have!! I cannot wait for the rest of the series. I want my own daughter to watch these when she gets a little bigger. It is just good, wholesome family fare. And I Love it!!"
3,A DVD only the hardcore fans will love.,"Being a hardcore Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew fan since I was a kid, this dvd came as a pleasant surprise. However, the wacky script and lame acting made me doze off to sleep at certain times. Still, for the real fan, this is a very good watch especially if you have nothing better to do at night."
1,Defective product - Don't buy it!,"I was so excited when I found out about this DVD. I couldn't wait to get it home and watch it. So far, I have been unable to watch two of the Hardy Boys episodes all the way through because the DVD is defective. The disc gets stuck on a frame and shuts off. I can't return it, so I guess I'll keep trying to watch the episodes that play."
2,"Universal, ugh, what can I say?","First off these are two sided DVDs. It seems only cheapskate Universal does this and it sucks. Also you get nice marketing in the form of previews at the beginning. WHY DO YOU PUT PREVIEWS ON A DVD PURCHASED FOR HOME USE? Because the bean counters at Universal want to figure out how to squeeze more money out of you by touting their other crap products. Not only that the packaging is crap also. Also, do not expect any extras here."
5,amazing and work great,"Great Unit! The power alone makes it a steal, the accessories make it wonderful! Wahl has the history, they're quality in terms of power and reliabilty have helped them stay in business against the cheaper producers."
4,"great clipper, poor package","I received the clipper in poor packing conditions. The original box of the clipper is broken and was fixed/kept together by packing tapes. However, the clipper inside seems to be brand new/unused. The clipper works much better than the old clipper I owned---it's very easy to glide through the thick hair without hair jammed between the comb. The adjustable blade is a plus for trimming some small areas. It's not ""quiet"" when operating, but at least is not too loud to bother my puppy too much."
1,Terrible Brittle Clipper Housing,"I am a pet groomer and groom every day. Very good clipper and was very quiet for the first month. After that, the clipper started getting louder every day. The reason being that the housing is made of plastic and seeing that the blade goes at 5000 strokes per minute, everything that keeps the housing together starts breaking. The last Wahl Arco SE clipper I bought, fell apart after three months. In all my years of grooming I have never seen anything like it. Lovely clipper while it works, but at the price tag it comes with, it is impossible to replace it every three months. I don't think I want to buy another one of these and I can surely NOT recommend this to any other groomer."
5,Great Clippers!,"I ordered this clipper at the recommendation of my dog breeder, and I am greatly impressed with the performance of these clippers. My dogs do not shy away from me when I used them on each one. I have to mini-Schnauzers, and they were skittish when using the 'traditional' clippers. These do not vibrate as much, therefore, making it a pleasure to groom them myself. The overall shape of the clipper is great because of there not being a cord to work around. The clippers are easy to use, easy to maintain, and easy to clean. Really glad I purchased this great Wahl product. Doggies are happy too!"
3,Only used it twice.,"First time it worked amazing. Second time it stopped cutting. Not sure what happened, but I think blade got very dull very quickly, it's just not going through my poodles hair. I've been grooming him for 5 years, so I know what Im doing. I kept blade very clean, battery is fine but clipper is making funny noises when go through his hair, it's not clipping."
3,PNY Reliability,"My 980 which I have had for a short time first lost one DVI output, and then the other. The 750 I have had for several years is still running. After reading the difficulties other Amazon customers have had in getting support, I am going with ATI, who made the card for my custom high performance laptop."
5,The best I ever had,"If you are a pimp gamer and love to filled your eyes with the best quality of images that video has to offer.Then this is all you, if not be with everybody else and they'restupid graphics.If u a gamer play HARD!"
5,Great System,"I'm not an audiophile, but after a lot of research, I bought this system. For a little more money than most HTIBs you get a lot more sound. This system can rattle my house and also plays the subtle sounds you expect from a good surround system. The room I set up my system in is 20x30, and I needed new speaker wires. If you use it in a big room, you'll need longer wire."
5,One of the best HTIB,"I've had the Onkyo HT-SR800 for over 9 months now... and I love it! The sound is incredible, and the receiver is AMAZING. I don't believe that the subwoofer is that weak actually. My neighbor has come several times to knock at my door to tell me to please bring down the thumping, that her apartment was shaking.... As with any other speaker or HTIB set, you need to purchase better wires, but that is all I needed to get. I believe it is one of the best out there, and now going for very little money. I highly recommend it."
2,pressure busts pipes,i reciently purchased this system at c.c. after doing my homework guess what happened when i applied pressure for 30/45 minutes THE SUB BLEW it smoked besides that its perfect lol.
4,Onkyo Home Theater,"We set it up after Christmas. Great sound, really liked that it auto adjusts the speakers with the mic system. I went with the receiver and speaker match system. Was pretty easy to set up."
1,"This would be a great system, but for one HUGE problem","Beware of this unit if you plan to use it as a home theatre system. It has HDMI inputs and outputs, BUT THEY DON'T PASS AUDIO! The whole beauty of HDMI is one cable for everything, but ONKYO has only added the plugs to fool you into buying their unit. You still have to use the regular audio plugs, in addition to the HDMI cable. If I had known this, I never would have bought it. I wasted a whole day trying to get it to work, because ONKYO isn't honest enough to warn you about this in the manual. This system is great overall, so it's a shame that some sleazy executive chose the low road, and resorted to misleading us like this. I'll never buy another ONKYO products again: you can't trust people qho behave like this."
3,Extremely average.,"I thought after all the reviews i had read i found a product that wasnt going to break the bank but give me an entry level theatre experience. Should have saved my money. Totally feels like a wal mart setup. You get what you pay for. Dont rule it out either, for the money, its not bad. Its just not for someone who has an out dated superior set up. If this is your first experience with something like this , i think you will love it.If you are trying to replace that 10 year old pioneer elite receiver, think again."
5,Great Product,"For the price, unbeatable product. The sound is phenomenal and unless you're doing more high tech operations than plugging in a state of the art television and dvd player, you'll never exceed the limitations of this machine.. and unless you pay twice as much, you won't get better sound quality."
4,Excellent Sound for Your Favorite Films,I have had the Onkyo HT-SR800 system for a couple of weeks now and have had a chance to experience more than a few films with the added dimension of 7.1 surround sound. It has made a big difference in the overall experience. The Onkyo system was extremely easy to set up. The wires and assorted hardware were all appropriate to the task. Calibration was perhaps the most enjoyable part of the whole enterprise. Simply placing the supplied microphone in three listening positions and letting the calibration program do its thing resulted in a totally balanced system that produced excellent sound immediately without any additional balance settings. This is definitely a fine system that was completely thought out by Onkyo.
5,Onkyo HT-SR800 7.1 a real bargain for the price!,Saw that Consumers Union rated it the best in-box 7.1 Surround system and we have not been disappointed. Superb sound and easy set-up. For the money cannot be beaten. Rivals the expensive Bose units and built as well. We highly recommend it.
4,Great system for less price !,"The product is really great and having a great time with my new 800.Had one problem though with the manual that came in the box. It was totally different and un-usable. I had to download from internet and change the settings.Overall experience with the seller was just ok, since I had many questions regarding the product and the manual for which they never got back to me."
4,Still a bit complicated,"While the sound is fine, getting the whole thing hooked up to get optimal sound is still a less than crystal-clear process. The manual seems to have all the info, but it can take a lot of time to find it. In this age of HDMI hook-ups, it would be nice if there was a concise simple explanation. Also, while it supports a few dozen audio playback modes, determining which will work with any given program or device is clear as mud. The LED display on the front which supposedly tells you this is very small. (I have to get down on my hands and knees and put on my glasses to see it, then try to determine which setting it correlates with.) That said, the sound is good, and while I don't feel like I really understand the thing, it may be as good or better than anything else out there."
2,any help?,"Received only a warning to not touch anything when when things went dead. Be certain there is an ONKYO service center next door,"
5,Entertainment System,I am very happy with this system. I will recommended it to my friend and family.
5,"Great value, takes time to learn all features","I have had this unit for about 3 weeks, it replaced a Sony Home Theater with DVD player. This has so much more functionality, although the speakers here are monstrously large (not exactly bookshelf!). Only odd thing is that the the sub goes idle (red light) if the volume is below a surprisingly loud level. Some have noted the low quality (and length) of the speaker wires, I replaced the rear only to 18g due to length but do not feel sound is compromised by the stock wires. Still, for the money this unit is a great value. Read the manual, take your time, all will work in the end."
5,Bang for your buck,"I am extremely happy with my decision to purchase this home theater in a box versus anything else I looked at. All the features are there. It is 7.1. It has POWER. It sounds excellent. Like everyone else said the wires it comes with are thin and you need to upgrade and get a thicker gauge for real quality. Possibility to upgrade in the future is there. Has a ton of digital audio inputs: 2 x Coax, 2 x Optical, which is necessary in 2008 when everything is pumping out quality sound these days."
5,Great for the money,"This is a very nice system for the money. It doesn't have many of the features that you would get with a higher-end reciever, but it has everything you really need.Pros: Great sound quality. Plenty of connection options for all of your devies. Looks good.The only real Con is the HDMI connectivity. The HDMI ports on the reciever are pointless. They act only as a pass-through switch, and a seperate connection to the reciever is still required to get sound. When I first installed the system I was very dissapointed, and I felt somewhat tricked by ONKYO's proud advertising of HDMI on the unit, but this was soon overcome by the excellent sound quality that you get for the money."
5,Great sound at a great price,"I convinced my parents to purchase Onkyo's similar 5.1 set several years ago, and I have always been very pleased with it. Thus, it was a no-brainer to me when it came time for me to purchase a home theater for myself. So far, the expectations have been met. It's great sound for a very affordable price. I can't imagine being more pleased with another set."
2,Don't be deceived by the size of the picture!,"I thought I was getting a full sized book but this is a POCKET sized book like another review pointed out! I knew it was too good to be true but my voice teacher and I both jumped at this product without paying attention to detail. That's why I gave this a two star rating because it was my fault for not checking EVERYTHING about the book out but to be fair it isn't easily noticed. Poor product representation on Amazon's part but what can I say. This is the first time I've ever been disappointed with an Amazon product so it had to happen sometime.Anyway, if you don't mind having a small handbook of many jazz tunes and want just to get started with these tunes this is actually a pretty decent book."
1,NOT what I was looking for,Maybe some where in the fine print I could have seen this is a pocket sized paper back with words and music too small to read........ but I apparently DIDN'T because i bought it and HATE it! I got it for my wife and it was a totally worthless purchase!
3,Not bad with slick new cards,"If you're using an older deck, it can be a little tricky. This is definitely the best inexpensive shuffling machine I've used so far. Most of the battery-operated ones really suck - they just don't work. This one's definitely worth the money. We play a game called Mhing with a 150-card deck, so this device saves lots of time shuffling.You have to be careful how you feed the cards into the shuffler for best results, but it's easy to get the hang of it.If you don't have the money to blow on a Vegas-style shuffler, this one will get you by. Perfect for bridge or poker nights."
1,Do Not Buy,We ordered this card shuffler and had to send it back. It jams often and was very frustrating to use. We would not recommend buying it!!
3,"Not a toy, it's for real","This shuffler is so good I'm about to buy a third one as another gift. We use it every week and find it to be very satisfactory. Just don't over load it, 1 1/2 decks on each side at a time works best.I did not get the third one and I am glad as the second one broke down soon after being put to use."
3,Rave Is The Rage,"OK, the title and cover aren't the greatest but the music is still toe-tappin'. Sheryl Crowe and other guest artists interject a fresh sound to this compilation that finds ""The Artist"" reaching back to his early 80's roots on many tracks. (Fans will notice the CD is produced by ""Prince."") Infectious grooves like ""Everyday is a Winding Road"" and ""Greatest Romance Ever Sold"" make me wonder how the likes of Brittney Spears can get so much airplay. My personal favorite is ""Baby Knows,"" in which Prince steps out of his funky shoes for some good ol' foot-stompin' honkey tonk. The best he's ever done? No. But even his mediocre is a lot better than what I've been hearing on the airwaves lately. Give it a listen."
3,Nothing new,"10 years ago a new prince album was realy a happening, but lately his albums are not very Xciting except from emancipation and new power soul. I was hoping that this album would bring a new fresh sound, an album so exciting that you want to play it over and over again. UNFORTUNATELY this album is not XCITING at all. Prince is repeating himself again with the same themes as always. Skip the first seven tracks if you don't want to falll asleep. The second half of the album is a little bit better. But there is nothing to RAVEon2 on this album."
5,Prince is back!,"For the last 2 days I've thoroughly enjoyed ""Rave"". I rushed to the stores on my lunch hour and was not disappointed! My personal favorites are Man'O'War, I love U, but I don't trust U anymore and the hidden track ""Pretty Man,"" which reminds me of one of my all-time favorites -- Sexy MF. It's just my opinion, but I highly recommend you to ""Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic""!"
4,good,"I think this cd is pretty good but not as I expected.The title track is ok but can get a bit boring.Undisputed is probably the worst track the album has.The best ones are The Greatest Romance Ever Sold,So far So pleased,Man o War,Baby Knows,I love u but I don't trust u,and wherever you go,Whatever you do.All in all,diehard fans will love it,while the rest might have some mixed feelings about it.RAVE on!"
2,Maybe Warners was right after all...,"If you liked the last three or four Prince albums, then by all means get this one. It's more of the same. More of the same flat, stale grooves and memory-defying melodies that have been his stock in trade since the Gold Experience, his last worthwile recording, in my opinion. If you, like me, remember when Prince made music that was clever, challenging, and exciting, then pass on this. You will definitely be disappointed. Most of the Artist's problems with WB were his former label's reluctance to let him release as much music as he wanted, whenever he wanted...if albums like Rave are the results of his ""emancipation"", then, as I said, maybe Warners was right after all! Here's hoping someday Prince gets out of his rut and gets back to making adventurous music again..."
3,Eh...,"He sounds fresh and energetic, the playing is very good throughout, and the production is clean and crisp. the problem is with the songs. Except for the ballads and ""Pretty Man"", they just aren't very interesting. And he's promoting this like it's a return to form, when THE GOLD EXPERIENCE and EMANCIPATION were two of his best, and they weren't all that long ago."
3,you goofed!,his name is not prince! its The Artist FORMALY KNOWN as Prince! but the cd wuz good anyways
1,Ugh. Yuck.,"When did Prince go from deliriously inventive artist to mediocre R&B hack? After the grandslam of Sign of the Times, Lovesexy, and Grafitti Bridge, I thought he could do no wrong. Turns out he can do nothing but. After spending the 1980s being one of the biggest Prince fans ever to walk the Earth, I've spent the 1990s hoping that his next CD will be his renaissance. But sadly, each CD released that I dupe myself into buying is worst than the last, with absolutely no inspritation, ingenuity, or music sensibility to be found. Listen to ""If I Was Your Girlfriend"" from Sign of the Times for a perfect example of Prince's former talents compared to his current songwriting crisis. It's a sad loss for me, but I don't like Prince's music anymore, nor do I appreciate a diatribe about the inhumanity of lamb's wool on the CD case. Oh well, no one can stay on top of their game forever."
1,Dismal: Tries to sound hip and still thinks he can rap!,"I can think of twelve songs he wrote in the 1980s that are both unreleased and much better than the insipid pap on this CD. Some artists stop making records when they get to be about 40 years old. Some continue, but no longer have hits because they don't sound cool to the 15 year olds. Then there's Prince. He threatens to retire every five years but releases albums that are neither mature nor appeal to the under 20 crowd. I used to look forward to a new Prince album -- and I bought them all (since 1984) on the first day (including this one). Never again. There is too much truly good music out there to waste my ears on this CD. There will never be another Prince. Sadly, 0+> is just a parody of Prince.When I see Mohammed Ali, I feel sorry for a man who clearly didn't know when to give up. Prince has done little but embarrass himself for years now. He is completely out of touch and I hope one day he'll realize that."
3,Enjoyable but not Great,"I've listened to this CD four times now and my opinion may well change since I find Prince albums get under my skin the more I listen to them.I'm a longtime Prince fan. I love his skill and originality with rhythm and arrangements - I don't tend to listen to the lyrics, but I bask in the music. Like most Prince albums Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic is beautifully recorded, seductive and stylish.My main gripe however is that there seems to be a lack of innovation here. Prince is doing more of the same very well. I enjoy being surprised and delighted by his music, but there's nothing here I haven't heard before.I hope The Artist takes more risks with his next album."
3,"time 2 retire, symbol man.","its time 4 the artist 2 give it up. he just isnt the creator he was 12 years ago. put out ROADHOUSE GARDEN, things the fans would enjoy when you were at your peak, with your best bandmates, theREVOLUTION. prince's creativity is running on fumes now.i rally thought 10 years ago the best was yet to come but sadly it wasn""t."
2,Kind of disappointing,"I've been a fan since Purple Rain and own almost every single album, but this one is kind of disappointing. Recycled stuff that reminds me of previous albums, only with much weaker lyrics. It used to be that every year he would surprise you and remind you why you got hooked in the first place. Not this time. -- Sometimes I wish he would just ""shut up and play the guitar""."
3,The Artist tries it again with Arista,"The best work from Prince since the Gold Experience. My favorite track is his cover of S. Crow's Everyday is a Winding Road, it's funky & very different from the origianl. Other stand out tracks are The Greatest Romance Ever Sold & the title track, as well as the hidden one. Hopefully this album will not be lost in the shuffle. Arista needs to release dance remixes of the singles, as they did with Whitney Houston's last album ""My Love is Your Love"" which helped bring it back from the dead."
1,Lost...,"Don't believe the hype. Coming from a huge prince fan, this album is incredibly mediocre. Save your money."
1,This cd is wack.,"Get RAINBOW CHILDREN instead, at least that one has soul.There's a better version of ""RAVE UN2.."" on the""Small Club 2nd Show"" bootleg.I'm a huge Prince fan but this is even worse than ""Emancipation"""
3,Still disappointing,"Prince hasn't released a sound album since ""The Gold Experience"" in 1995. His Post-Warner period is very disappointing, letting most of his fans down. His good albums are ""1999"", ""Purple Rain"", ""Sign of The Times"", ""Graffiti Bridge"", ""Diamond and Pearls"", ""Symbol"", ""Come"" and ""The Gold Experience"". Even his weak efforts ""Around the World in a Day"", ""Parade"", ""Lovesexy"", ""Chaos & Disorder"" are more powerful than ""Emancipation"" (probably a strong album in 2 CDs), ""The New Power Soul"" (a rubbish) and this one. Why doesn't The Artist make use of the freedom that he has got to release albums that would make all fans really fantastic with more gems and shut Warner's mouth up? Now what he does proves Warner right! His recents albums lack the power that displays in ""Diamond & Pearls"", ""Come"", ""The Gold Experience"" and even ""Chaos & Disorder""! Please don't let us down anymore, The Artist!"
5,Possibly the greatest album of the Year,"When you first pick this cd up, I am going to say something I would otherwise never say: Skip to the third track. The reason for this is that the cd flows better if you start on this track, put the cd on repeat, and hear the first two songs last.Anyway, my review on this album is quite simple, it is incredible in every aspect of musicdome. Prince recieved a lot of flak for creating a studio album after his huge problem with Sony, and this is the main downside in most reviews of it. They prefer to look at the controversy surrounding a cd instead of commenting on the incredible vocals, or the seamless guitar, or a beautiful duet with Gwen Stefani.Here's my final words of advice:Buy this Cd right now."
4,Pretty cool,"I am, admittedly, not the HUGEST fan of 'prince' or 'The Artist', but I do have this album. I've always respected The Artist for his talents and depth of musical experimentation/achievement. He is an interesting musical artist.The Album:The songs are creative, and sometimes inspiring. The musical 'sound' quality is superb. The sound of the album is astonishing when using high-quality stereo equipment for playback. The music on the album is mostly not to my liking, with the notable exception of a few tracks: Numbers 1,2,3 and 18.2 is great for me, being a hip-hop fan, since it contains rap by Chuck D of Public Enemy."
2,"Aw come on, Man!","Looks like I have no choice but to turn to D'Angelo to get new, Prince inspired music. I gave up on the real thing. Rave isn't bad,(I do like ""Greatest Romance Sold"") but it isn't as good as some of these die-hard Prince fans who are reveiwing this CD is making it out to be! This is certainly not something that deserves five stars! Prince is beyond this...Or so I thought. Whatever happened to that delicious, innovative and beautiful music he used to make? Even his live concerts are starting to stink! I guess that all I can do now is curl up to his past legendary work and look out for other artists who are reviving the Purple One's old sounds."
3,don't be so blind,"everybody is still giving him such high marks for an album that is not his best. sure there are some good songs; it is an interesting listen, but come on! he's still full of ego, and the simple plain fact is that he is releasing too much material. he needs 2 sit on some songs 4 a while and then blow everyone away. chaos and disorder, an album he hates, is way better than this. he needs to get out of paisley park more and let someone else produce him. sure, he can do it himself, but he won't die if eno or lanois or dallas austin produce an entire platter. the name stuff is tiring, he's getting real boring, and it's sad because he really is a master. but not judging by this."
4,The funny thing about this album and the artist...,"Is that most of its and his critics are under the assumption that he creates music for our satisfaction rather than his own simple expression. This album is a simple one with catchy parts here and there that are the mirror of an artists mind. Everyone is so concerned that he should BLOW US AWAY, everyone except him. I love the album. We see Prince again, playing 95% of the instruments, humbly like on ""For You"" and ""Prince"" doing what he likes--recording and making it availible for you to take it or leave it. With Warner, we fans never had the choice to take or leave so many albums of Prince's work."
4,He's Comin' Back to Us!,"Extremly good record. Not brilliant and perfect like Sign O' The Times, but certainly not as intolerable as Chaos and Disorder...Nice to hear him keep Gwen Stephani's voice at bay...Sheryl Crow cover is amazing...If any reason to buy it, clearly for I Love U... and PrettyMan - these cuts are the atypical of those in the past that have made him my fave artist of all freakin' time."
4,"Starts Off Excellant, Finishes Sub-par","There are only two things I can find wrong with The Artist's ""Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic"". 1) It just starts off too darn good for me! I love ""Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic"", ""Undisputed"", ""Greatest Romance Ever Sold"", ""Hot Wit U"", ""So Far, So Pleased"", ""Tangerine"" & ""The Sun, The Moon And Stars"". Then it starts going downhill for me, I just can't stand the music to some of the remaining tracks. The other bad thing is one of the hidden tracks is just a promotional plug for his two websites and his merchandise 800 number. Why do we need to hear that on the disc when he also has it on the album booklet? Anyway, this CD is many times better than last year's ""New Power Soul"" and I like how he encorporated some rock songs into the hip-hop fare, it was a welcome sound and proves to me that he is THE artist at whatever genre he picks."
5,Prince is BACK,Did anyone notice that this latest release is produced by PRINCE. Yes Prince. It says it on the cover. I was so thrilled to him use his name again. Not only is he back. He is sounding better than ever. This is his best album since Diamond & Pearls. I can't get enough of this CD. My neighbors are probably tired of hearing but that's just TOO BAD!
3,MEDIOCRE AT BEST,"As a longtime Prince fan, I looked forward to a new, cohesive album - one that might harken back to the days of Sign Of The Times. I especially hoped that the creative pairings might prove interesting. I was mostly disappointed on all fronts. He keeps trying to rap, and it doesn't work. Neither do the efforts of Chuck D and Eve. A perfectly laid back effort like ""The Sun, the moon and stars"" is ruined by the introduction of a calypso-style quasi-rap. The best stuff (So Far, So Pleased; Baby Knows; Wherever U Go. . . ) does not ever rise to the level a longtime fan expects. While better than the most recent throw-offs and experiments, ""Rave"" is certainly not the return to form longtime fans are craving."
3,"A good album,but nothing to rave about!","The new issue from the mighty Artist is a bit of a disappointment since it is a thoroughly predictable trip,hard to distinguish from similar,highly-polished R&B releases.The all-star cast doesn't help since their input is minimal,while the Artist seems to have lost that dangerous and offensive edge-his last great album was 'The Gold Experience'in 1995.This album is worth having,but there is better in his discography."
2,Salute the Sarge,"A one-album deal with Arista Records was slated to be a solid comeback album for Prince, though company president Clive Davis really cluttered things up with guest performances that makes it seem like a tribute to the artist.The 18 tracks (clocking in at 73:50) are a mixed bag due to the collaborative nature - artists appearing include Sheryl Crow, Gwen Stefani, Eve and Ani DiFranco - with the single, The Greatest Romance Ever Sold, limping in at #63 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The second of two ""hidden"" tracks, the funky Pretty Man, is the standout, as Maceo Parker sizzles on the sax.One year later, Prince released a remix of the album on his Internet subscription service. He symbolically showed his displeasure with Arista by ""smashing"" the CD at the end of his album. That action speaks clearly on Prince's ""appreciation"" of the meddling by another major record label, this time on what could have been a true comeback."
3,"""Last attempt to please fans....What did we Get?","I am a huge Prince fan, I even defended and stuck with him through the 90's. But I am also a honest person and this cd is just O.K ! Some of the songs are dated and some sound like he just yanked them out of the vault. There is bareley any funk on this one. The stand outs are ""Greatest Romance, So Far,So Pleased,Where ever you Go,Undisputed,..The rest is just filler. And even those tracks sound like retreads of some of his earlier songs with less creativity. I don't know, I just don't Know ! Had a chance at another commercial release and this was the best he can deliver. Nothing to run home and tell moma about but is a O.K cd! If you like real prince in the 90's that is overlooked material.GetCrystal Ball 4 disc set (Old Unreleased material + remixesEmancipation 3 disc set (Just a fun innovative project)Come (Very Dark but great artistic work)"
3,A Shadow of His Former Self,"Make no mistake, ""Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic"" has some pretty impressive stuff from Prince, but as a whole, it's just another lackluster release. The title track gets off to a promising start with its stripped-down funk, but right after that, things get patchy. While standouts include the honest ""I Love U, But I Don't Trust U Anymore,"" we also get a pedestrian cover of Sheryl Crow's ""Every Day is a Winding Road."" Most of the rest of the album is subpar, but never disastrous. While Maxwell, D'Angelo, and MeShell all owe a big artistic debt to Prince, their music is far more relevant and funkier than his own. Prince seems one step behind of everyone else. Here's hoping that trend will be reversed."
4,"not his best, but very enjoyable","Is it his best album of the decade? No-- Gold Experience, Graffiti Bridge, and the Symbol Album are all better. It's not even his best album since the name change--Gold beats it by a mile. But it IS a highly enjoyable, multilayered experience that gets better every time you hear it. Tangerine, Rave, Sun-Moon-Stars, and So Far, So Pleased are the standouts, but really, aside from the inanities of strange but true and the lousy winding road cover, everything on here is worth a listen. It ranks somewhere below Parade, Sign, PR, and 1999, but far above Around the World, Come, C&D, etc. Like that wacky, brilliant black sheep relative, Prince can be infuriating, lazy, silly, obtuse, pretentious, and arrogant (anyone listen to new power soul or come lately?)-- and then blow you away with one guitar riff or vocal whoop. Playing the dozens, mixing styles with abandon and clearly having a great time, Prince remains a paragon of pop."
4,Very Good,"The Artist has gotten back to his guitars here. Although not as good as Sign Of The Times or Purple Rain, it is his best work of the 90's along with Chaos and Disorder.The songs Greatest Romance, I Love You, and Wherever You Go are the artist in his peak form again."
4,Absolutely amazing,"This band is freaking amazing. the only reason i rated it four stars instead of five is because it is there first album and i have a feeling the best is yet to come. If you heard their first demo, you might have noticed some flat, boring vocals, but now with a new lead singer, and now a synthesizer, this cd will keep you interested the whole way through."
4,Great album,This is a great album with plenty of Johnny Cash's best songs. This version includes several songs that were not on the original release.
5,"If this doesn't move you, you aren't alive.","My father listened to Johnny Cash back in the early 70s. I couldn't possibly appreciate the music in my early years... what a shame. This is timeless music. It's a no-brainer for JC fans, but if you're a budding JC fan - this is a must-add. It's really a true classic. 25 Minutes to Go, Dirty Old Egg-Suckin' Dog, John Henry's Hammer... the whole album is just amazingly entertaining. If you don't tap your foot, laugh out loud, and truly appreciate the working man, you can contact me for a refund."
5,Extra Cash,"This magical recording of Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison is a warts and all live recording in front of several hundred plus prisoners in January 1968. The atmosphere is electric, with frequent shouts and spontaneous applause and whistles from the crowd. Even some of the official prison announcements are left in the recordings.Highlights are many as Cash has chosen his set carefully with the audience in mind. So '25 minutes to go' (a reference to the electric chair), 'Cocaine Blues' and his own 'Fulsom Prison Blues' are all brilliant performances.I first heard Johnny Cash through his later American recordings. These are great albums but on the last three or four his voice getting weaker after each album. The difference in his voice here is pretty startling and he puts it to great use.The CD is very well packaged with interesting sleeve notes by Cash, written in 1999 and also by Steve Earle. There are also plenty of stills from the show itself."
3,not my favorite,"I have many J Cash CDs and don't listen to this one.I know the history behind it, but for casual listening it doesn't have the sound quality or variety of my other Cash Cds."
3,BEEN A J.CASH FAN AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER,"I saw Johnny Cash live on stage in 1972 in Utica, New York,Johnny, June and his band just blew me away. This man has been everywhere! There is nothing like his live concerts. Buy this cd, you will love it."
3,A collector item for Fans,"The main reason I bought this set is to watch the performances of Johnny Cash in Folsom Prison on DVD. I remember watching ""Johnny Cash in Folsom Prison"" on TV when I was in Australia, in 1969 and enjoyed the TV special very much. It was a long special with him performing and showing the prisoners and the clanking of the jail house gates. I bought the Legacy package hoping that the DVD will contain that concert video or at least part of it but was very disappointed that it hardly has any visual of Johnny Cash performing in Folsom at all. However, I do enjoy the extra tracks in the CDs although I already have most of the songs. I guess this is a collector's item."
5,This must be the best of them all!,"It's hard to imagine that this record could be topped. It's the combination of great music plus the emotions from the special setting that send a chill down your spine every time you listen to this record. The sequel ""At San Quentin"" has a considerably different character. Folsom Prison, however, must be THE place where Johnny Cash really wanted to perform. This re-issued recording sounds as genuine and honest as one can possibly imagine. What a tribute to Johnny Cash's 70th birthday!"
5,Love Johnny Cash,"I saw ""Walk the Line"" and fell in love with Johnny Cash, this is a great CD. Absolutely fabulous."
5,"""Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison"" is brilliant!","""Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison"" is brilliant! This is the best of Johnny Cash's albums and now one of my favorites, which also includes ""Johnny Cash At San Quentin"".Track Listing1. Folsom Prison Blues2. Busted3. Dark As The Dungeon4.

Greystone ChapelTracks that I enjoyed: All of them!"
5,At Folsom,"This is vintage Johnny Cash. You can listen to him draw the tough crowd into his concert. Not for the young kids though, some profanity and honky tonk type songs. If you love Johnny cash, you'll love this album."
5,Awesome,I only learned about this cd through the film- what a find. It is so electric and incredible. I highly recommend.
5,I'm speechless,"This is the greatest live album ever recorded, by a mile. No matter how brilliant moments of magic albums such as The Who's Live At Leeds include, this is the one live album you should own. Of course, Johnny Cash himself is larger than life, but it is the electricity, the emotion and the interaction between the performer and the unique audience that makes this album so huge. If this was the only album you owned, you'd still have a mighty record collection."
4,Johnny...enough said,"I bought this because my son enjoys Johnny Cash. He is nine. We play it for him while he falls asleep. So I purchased this to have ""just in case"" to play on my Amazon MP3 on my Galaxy SIII if we were staying away from home. Thing is I enjoy it too. Reminds me of growing up and the music my father listened to."
5,Great Album!,"Have been getting into Johnny Cash recently, and this is a great album that grows on you with every listen!"
1,DVD wont play!,DVD would not play it skipped then froze. and two repetitious CD's....I expected more. At least be able to watch the video
3,At Folsom Prison,"As you may gather by now, I am an avid fan of Johnny Cash and June Carter. May their souls rest in peace."
5,Folsom Prison Blues Review,this was a gift to my boyfriend for his birthday and he was pleasantly pleased. He had been looking for this product for quite awhile and I was reluctant enough to find it on Amazon! You can find just about anything on here.
3,More June,"The highlights of this LP--""Folsom Prison Blues"" and ""Jackson,"" in particular--are so great that they nearly make up for they corny ballads in between. Nearly.A few more performances by June Carter, who growls like a bear on ""Jackson,"" and a little less dependence on sappy tear-jerkers from the Man In Black, and this would be a more listenable LP"
2,Poser Cash,"Honestly, I don't find much here to like. With a few exceptions (e.g. Jackson)the songs all sound pretty much the same and it's tough to make it through the whole album as a result. This leaves the album to stand on its lyrics which paint a colorful picture of Cash's life as a violent criminal. Of course, Cash wasn't a violent criminal, he's just another musician who got strung out on drugs. So here we have a recovering addict playing the role of a violent felon in an attempt to seem ""real"" to his audience of violent felons. This makes the whole thing seem really fake to me and sad for Cash when I give this album a listen."
5,THE best,"I have to say, I have come to realize this is one of my favorite albums of TIME tied with Houston Marchman's - Naked The Best of Houston Marchman. Both are soooo good and I can listen to their voices over and over again and never get tired. Houston Marchman is special in that his music is filled with soul, passion, and solid lyrics. He truley has THE best singing vioce I have ever heard in my entire life. You should check out the cd if you enjoy j CASH. Both have the best songs EVER!"
5,One of the best live recordings Ever,"There are three live concert recordings that should be in everyone's collection: Johnny Cash Live at Folsom Prison, Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall and Benny Goodman's 1939 Carnegie Hall concert. In all of these recordings the artist is at the peak of their powers. More than that, though, the interaction between artist and fans is captured perfectly and vastly enhances the listener's enjoyment. You experience first hand why these artists mean so much to so many."
5,Cash before a captive (literally) audience,"This is a magnificent recording from the days before country and western became indistinguishable from bad pop music. Johnny Cash, whose own life was pretty hard and dirty at times, commands the respect of his audience and establishes a rapport with them that few entertainers could achieve. Not surprisingly, a number of the songs are about prison life. Country songs often deal in maudlin sentimentality, but great performers like Cash sell these songs because you just know they mean every word of it. This version presents the full set, preserving Cash's banter with the spectators and including several minutes during which the tape was apparently left running, allowing us to listen in on snatches of conversation from the milling crowd, announcements over the prison PA system, and other sounds that make this a valuable record of an extraordinary time and show."
5,"more cash, forever more cash","My uncle taught me to be a Johnny Cash fan as a tot. He had me singing ""Five Feet High and Rising,"" ""I walk the Line,"" and others, before America put a man on the moon. When this album came out, Mom was horrified by some of the content. She made a butchered version of it, on tape, that she saw fit for me to listen to. Thank Heaven for CD's like this one, wheve where every song and every aside, profane or otherwise, is included. There are four live albums by Cash that I'm aware of, 3 of which I own. This one may be the best. If not, it's for one reason--the songs are sung much faster than their studio originals, and in some cases verses are clipped out. That's the one and only quibble. The enthusiasm of the audience makes up for that, and the studio versions can be found, if you look around for them, on songs lik ""The Wall,"" and ""dark as a Dungeon,"" both of which were shortened for reasons not clear to me. This album is a must have for Cash fans."
4,great cash,i've only recently become interested in johnny cash's music and this was my first album. the live recording does a great job of filling in the lines on who johnny cash was in addition to a good sample of his music. i am enjoying getting to know cash.good purchase.
1,Should have stayed in Prison!,"I don't think anyone should be rewarding a convict by buying an album they made while incarcerated. Plus this music is depressing, isn't fun and doesn't rock. He even has an song glorifying Cocaine! While I'm sure Motley Crew and Warrant did there fair share of Cocaine at least they rocked and stayed out of prison. Plus the guitar solos are boring and use no effects like a wah wah peddle. Not recommended for fans who want to ROCK"
4,the man,Jonny cash will never be forgotten he is the original country music star. He is hard core and you always new about how he lived through his songs. This cd box set is amazing and everyone who is a Cash fan should have one.
2,Johnny Cash,The dvd was disappointing as I thought it was the actual concert. It in fact was a documentary with very little actual footage of the concert. The music qualtiy was also very poor. One cd does have the music the other is mostly talking. Had I looked into it more I would not have purchased it.
2,very disappointed,"After thoroughly enjoying the ""Reggae for Kids"", I thought I'd add another favorite music style (Cajun) to our collection. Some songs on this CD are fine, but with a story between every song, there is no continuity and it reminds me of ""Barney"". I suggest buying a Cajun CD without a kid emphasis for a little one's musical enjoyment."
5,"Fun, bouncy and informative! you can't sit still!","This CD is full of happy, bouncy, can't sit still music for kids and their parents. Papillon is so likeable and a wonderful host through the world of the Cajun people. He even offers kids simple French lessons. My two year old knows Bonjour! and Mon ami! and coco-drie. The watermelon man and coco-drie songs are standouts! I highly recommend this."
5,This is dance music for little ones!,"I bought this CD for my sister's children. They are one and five. It has become their favorite, so much that my sister almost had a heart attack when she left it at my mother's and we had to mail it back immediately! Even the little one who is just starting to speak asks for ""Do Do'"" shorting a title song Fais Do Do. They dance in the kitchen to the music. I have seen them dance for the entire CD. The narative portions are a nice break between the dances. They also now call all alligators ""Cocodrie."" I wish he would come out with another kids title. I would buy it in a heatbeat."
4,Thick and rugged,"The guy in the picture should look more happy! He is wearing a totally sweet shirt! I like mine and it fits well. A little short in the sleeves for me, but someone once told me that I have a plus 1 ape index (a little long armed). So, I roll my sleeves up a little bit, just like in the picture, which makes me feel as if I am working harder than I really am."
5,great prices,bought these for my son for his new job. he loves them. nice colors..nice fit. wash and dry well. comfortable to wear. fast shipping
1,misleading description,"The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product, but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt, which I took as 2-pack...and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $14 popped up, but then it had $10 shipping when I ordered 2 items, so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts, I ended up paying $19 per shirt. I think it is a deliberate misleading product description."
3,Good enough if you dont need 1080p,"In spite of its advertised 1080p capability this cable WILL NOT pass a 1080p signal thru it without video noise in the form of snow. It is not a HUGE problem but it is definitely there and annoying. It is especially noticeable in dark scenes and menus. I tried it with a bluray, xbox 360 and PS3 and experienced noise on all 3 sources. I replaced the cable with my old hdmi and there is no noise so it is def this cable. I would not recommend buying this if you want a pure clean 1080p signal."
2,Not 22awg,"The cable is not 22awg. The price I good but the product isn't. Many users might not have any trouble with the cable, but if you know you needed a 22awg cable due to a weak signal, buying this cable is just a waste of everyody's time."
4,Really great cable for the $$,"Only caveat was this is not a 1.4 cable and when I update to ""3D"" it will need replaced, 3D requires a cable rated at 1.4a or better (bigger # is better) If you intend on using this on a ""shutter"" style 3D system, move on and find the higher rated cable.As for my use:I ran this to an Epson 8350 and found the cable to be just fine. I did NOT have any issues with RFI (snow) or other artifacts in the image. I run at 1080P with blu-ray and the image quality at 110"" is just fine. I bought an extra so I could drag a line out to my HDMI laptop (was a great move)"
4,Heavy duty but...,"the cable is well constructed and passes the digital signal with no discernible loss but it comes with ferrite blocks on each end of the cable and the item description doesn't mention it, plus the picture shown for the item doesn't show the ferrite blocks. The blocks caused some real headaches while installing the cable through the wall and floor because the blocks are slightly too large to pass through most wall plates designed for A/V cables and require some minor trimming with a utility knife. Functionally, the cable is excellent and comes at a price well below that offered at local big box stores. I will purchase again."
3,hdmi distance limitation,"keeping the cable at 50 foot will work but if you couple it, say with anohter 20 foot because you need additonal lenght, it did not work for me it did not transmit picture or sound coming from my tv . I also used a heavy hdmi 70 ft cable, one piece, it did not work either. This would possibly indicate that the distance may be too long for hdmi. I am going to try component cable.edfrom my above experience I would keep my hdmi run 50 ft or under."
1,BAD SERVICE,I ORDERED FOR 22AWG CABLE THEY SENT ME THE 28AWG WHICH IS VERY INFERIOR QUALITY. GOOD THING IT NOTICED. I RETURNED IT BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE REFUND YET.
4,German hell e casting,"I had the privilege of seeing these guys during their prime in Atlanta back about '99, and they were marvelous. This reunion event is good, but the ""magic"" wasn't quite the same in Germany. Donahue seems a little less inspired than when I saw him back when. Jorgensen seems to be the star, and his tone is signature, plus filling in aptly on B3. We've grown accustomed to very ""you are there"" feeling concerts, and this one lacks some of that. But any H3 concert is history in the making, and if you haven't evr seen them live, go for it. It will be a conversation piece among your fellow picker friends , no matter when in the future you view them."
1,Very Poor For The Hellecasters,Low Budget Production. Sounded more like a warm up for a pratice sesson rather than a gig. All 3 Cd's 8/10 Video 2/10
1,VERY Disappointed - Poor Quality - Cheap Look,Photo on the ad looked great -- Good looks at what seemed a fair price. I thought I was getting 3-dimensional ornamentation on this fan. Instead what arrived was a cheap design that was stamped on. Fan itself is not of high quality. I have had much better looking and performing fans for less money. I would not buy from this company unless I actually saw the product in person and in operation.
5,Ancient Teachings,"The processes of spiritual enlightenment are outlined in this book even if written with an occassional dogmatic term. This was no doubt due to the consciousness of the times even though the information is ancient and the steps of enlightenment universal. Only a Master could outline such information while keeping the deeper meanings obscured. What meaning a person gives to the phraseology can only be conjucture and is limited by the capacity of the intellect, meanwhile, the imagination runs rampant, hopefully, to open the door to higher intuitional knowing. A very valuable read for those experiencing evolutionary changes in their lives for which they have no reference. It might be said that this book can only be understood years later.....after a person has traversed certain life passages."
4,Theosophy encapsulated,"This classic explanation of the complexities that are involved in the Theosophic ritual of Initiation contains information that includes a summary of Theosophic philosophy. Although not ""easy"" to read, it is certainly more readable than the books by Helen Blavatsky or Ann Bessant. Whether one accepts the existence of Ascended Masters and Light Beings from other planets or realms who control all phases of earthly life, or not, this is worthwhile reading for those who are interested in how the process works (in fact or in theory).To study any aspect of metaphysics, one must be open to the possibilities that may exist in the non-physical realms. This book contains much information of how initiations are performed in the mystical realms and why it is done in that manner. While reading this book, many gems of insight occurred to me; terms and words of which I was aware but whose meanings escaped me. I feel more knowledgeable now even though I still am not a ""believer""."
3,"Worth reading, almost impossible to verify","I think there is some accurate info here (the made-up Tibetan master name aside). But actually verifying it is challenging. Others I know who have read this agree the material was more likely channeled. The Tibetan name is clearly made up. If you like reading about ascended masters, this is definitely a book for you. I think it's more likely true spiritual teachings from established religions, without the dogma and baggage of those teachings that have accrued around the original founder's message."
2,Magical mystical tour de farce,"What a wonderful, exciting world Alice lived in, though a little racist and Aryan-centric. Nothing mundane about it with gurus and masters and mythological beings all over the place, exercising their benign designs on humanity. Oops, that was just before WWII with tens of millions slaughtered, massive firebombing and the use of nukes. Imagine how bad it would've been without all these masters."
3,Can't find parts!,"Repeated attempts to e-order replacement parts have been futile. With only one (CH recommended) supplier in my area, I didn't have any other choice. The supplier took SIX WEEKS to get a simple part (spray needle), and then the part was WRONG (tho the part-number on the package matched the part-number that came with the unit's manual). I think CH needs to offer parts directly to the consumer, ""web-style""! Jerry D."
4,Good little sprayer.,"I read a lot of reviews about this sprayer before making the purchase, and they helped alot, but there were still some surprises, mostly good.First, I haven't had any clogging problems. Cleanup takes a bit longer than normal, but it's not bad.Second, this unit is not as loud as advertised. In my garage, with the doors open, it's not bad, and I haven't felt the need for earplugs. It is not as loud as my shopvac.Third, the overspray problem that some have complained about, does not seem to be a problem for me.I was surprised by the heat buildup in the spray gun and hose... the low pressure air is very warm, but it is not a real problem.The only negative I can offer, is that the coverage rate is a little slower than I expected.I think this is a great sprayer for the money."
1,Item is not what's pictured.,"I ordered the Campbell Hausfeld HV2000 based on the pic on Amazon's website and discussions with the folks at Campbell Hausfeld. The CH people told me that this model has the MP3311 spray gun (this is what is pictured). So I went ahead and ordered it.The gun that came with the unit was a lower quality gun that would come with HV1000 series systems. It had an aluminum cup and tip...but that was it. The rest of the gun was plastic. Very cheap. Very disappointing. I could have purchased this same unit at home depot for much less.Note that the 1-star rating is not due to the performance of the unit as I never bothered to use it. I used a CH HVLP in the past and was happy with it's performance.This one is going back to Amazon, and I'll order the HV2500 instead."
1,Bad Idea,"As a woodworker with a full spray booth and professional equipment, I was looking for something portable to repair a damaged panel on a job site (Movers dropped a large object against sequenced panels). I was hoping to tape off the area and blend the finish. I tested the machine in my shop spray booth first, and I am glad I did. Put it this way, unless you are using this to water your plants forget using this machine. Anything you attempt to spray through this must have the consistancy of filtered drinking water. It either spits out clumps or it works like the Miracle Grow fertalizer gun on your garden hose. Save your money. Lastly clean up is a disaster."
1,Don't buy this product,I own this sprayer and it is not woth the money. You cannot get a fine spray pattern from this unit. The air cap is poorly machined and the turbine does not supply enough CFM. Spend more money and get an Accuspray system.
5,Painted Kitchen Cabinets,"I started a started a project of painting my kitchen cabinets with rollers and brushes. I had 2/3rds of the primer on and just gave up, it was too time-consuming and difficult. I logged on, found this paint sprayer and have just completed the project. I've never used a paint sprayer before but found this very easy to use. Only one knob to control the flow and a trigger to spray. Very easy. The paint applied beautifully and it looks professional. I was worried about runs in the paint, but it rarely happened; only if the sprayer got too close. I used if for both latex and oil-based enamel. At first the oil-based paint would not come out. I discovered I was not thinning the paint enough. It is easy to disassemble and clean. I am never going back to brushes and rollers."
5,Great Book for Info on area,This book was great for planning our first visit to the area. We wanted to do lots of sightseeing and this book was very informative and helped us to find the sights we were looking for.
3,Fein Blade Purchase,"I go thru a lot these blades..you just cannot beat the prices that I can find on Amazon for these blade, on my last order I placed it was for three 2 1/2"" ""Precision"" E cut when they arrived the package had two Precision and one ""regular"" it didnt bother me because I used it the next day and it performed just as well as the more expensive type blades, plus what I was working on did not demand that clean or precise of a cut, so next time I will purchase both types for my indispensible Fein tool?Ted MartinT M Construction"
2,Blades are very expensive,Agreed with all the folks who mention that the blades are very expensive. I would think that Fein or some other blade company could make a fortune if they made a better blade at half the price. Also agree that I never would have bought the Fein Multimaster had I realized that the blades were so expensive. I find myself looking to other cutting tools instead of using the Multimaster. At some point I will look at replacement tools where the blades are cheaper. Probably soon.
2,Weak and expensive,"The multimaster is a great tool but the blades are a real disappointment. Bought a set of these even higher priced blades with the expectation that they would last longer and went through two of them in a matter of hours. The teeth are just weak and wear out or break off easily. I was doing nothing more than cutting 2x4's and some 3/4"" pine subfloor and 1/3 of the teeth just broke off on one and the other dulled so quickly that it just started burning through the wood. So much for spending more. These blades need to drop in price by a lot or be re-engineered for reliability and longevity."
2,great tool--fragile blades,"I agree totally with many other reviewers. Great tool, but theseblades are very expensive considering that the teeth break off veryvery easily. To make a blade last, you must really use the ""whiteglove"" treatment, otherwise one blade equals one cut. Too bad, i lovethis tool, but will use it only as a last resort because of blade expense."
2,Expensive and fragile,"The Fein Multimaster is an indispensable tool. Not perfect but It is much better than any of the other brands. However, the blades are greatly overpriced. They vibrate a lot, burn the wood, can break, and dull easily. That would be OK if they were inexpensive so that you could replace them as often as needed. Can't wait until another manufacturer comes up with an inexpensive good blade. No one will buy Fein blades anymore."
1,multimaster wood blades,use only universal e-cut blades- those made for wood or metalthese blades dull too quickly and don't hold upand are too expensive as well
3,Fine Fein,"These are great for cutting softer woods and plywood. Don't use them on hard woods like maple because the teeth will deteriorate quickly. If you need to cut hardwoods use the 1"" wide blades, they are much better. Fein makes good products but they must think that we are all rich like they must be. Their prices are way too high. Soon there will be others that will interchange and the prices will come down. In the meantime we will keep making them rich."
3,Over Priced,"This blade is over priced, and while it cuts wood quite well, be careful not to hit any nails or other hard material such as concrete as this will wipe your blade out. One would think that for the price paid for this blade, it would be carbide tipped, but it is only made from high speed steel. I like the hint from another reviewer that used his dremel tool with a cutoff wheel to re-grind teeth in the blade to get a little more life out of the blade. While it does not work quite as well as the original new blade, it does work marginally well -- which saves you money. Maybe Fein will someday get a clue, and make a quality blade, or charge a more reasonable price for the inferior quality blade they produce."
4,Likes to walk on you,"Overall, the Fein Multimaster is a GREAT tool. I own another of a different brand, yet always reach for the Fein. This particular attachment is good for plunge cuts only. If you try to run the length of a board/piece of wood, it will stray/walk on you, leaving a really ugly, wavy cut, EVEN if you press against your guide firmly. The circle/semi-circle attachment is better for that but it's weak; it bends easily. The last time I bought the latter attachment, I used it once then tossed it because it was so mangled. Quite delicate for a power tool attachment."
2,Fein blades,"Works great for a few cuts in soft wood. Way too expensive to replace, worth about 25% the price."
5,Gotchi Gear Charms,I bought this item for my 17 yr old daughter and she was quite happy with it. She said it seems pretty durable. It was part of a birthday gift for her and she was quite happy with it.
2,Jamie,"This book is a bunch of intellectual garbage. The author uses many big words and quotes prestigious thinkers, and yet doesn't actually say anything new or provacative. This book is definitely not worth reading."
2,Exclusion and Embrace,"A very scholarly theologist's opinions on forgiveness, reaching out to enemies, respecting others not like us, and other good Christian ideas. However, the writing style is that of a professor writing for doctoral candidates with many repeat explanations and numerous references and citations. It is very difficult to read, and the ""pearls"" are often buried in very dense prose. Its ideas stimulated discussion in a Bible study class, but we spent more time discussing the ideas than discussing the book."
4,weapon retention uses?,"Purchased as a backup knife for utility use -- and with potential weapon retention benefits for law enforcement use. Consider placing this on your off-hand side in an inconspicuous place, to be possibly used if someone were to attempt to disarm you while your gun is in its holster. From some practice (with a prop), there are many ways to integrate this knife into ground fighting or standing weapon retention.As a utility knife, the tear-drop shape lacks a usable blade surface. If you want something like this that is also good all-around, consider a ""hybrid"" hideaway knife."
3,Sharp knife but...,"The knife is great. Very sharp, very small.The cord is my issue: as a novice it would have been very helpful to have recieved some instructions on how/why to use the paracord that came with the knife. I used the photo to attempt to wrap the handle as shown, but some instruction would have been great. Also, the paracord bracelet shown is NOT included. The paracord is just wrapped and included with the knife."
1,not worth it,might be OK if it didn't roll down from the waist all the way down! Under your clothes! not good
4,love it while it lasts,this product works perfectly and does miracles... my only negative opinion is that it has a short life... after using it a saveral times it gets too lose it doesn't hold as good anymore!long story short it's good for special occasions not an everyday use!
3,A Comment on Texas Snakes,"Excellent color photography and range maps, but does not use standardized common names (which have been established and used nationwide since 1978) and the taxonomy (scientific names) is out-dated. Too much emphasis on subspecies. A good book, but it needed more outside review by herpetologists of a younger generation."
2,Not what I was looking for,"If your a novice dog trainer looking for methods using the shock collar, this book is not for you. Just about every approach in the book used a shock collar. I believe dogs do not have to be trained in this manner. All it takes is a little more time and both you and the dog will benefit and the dog will have a much stronger bong"
5,"Functional, Durable, Inexpensive, and Highly Endorse.","bi-directional albums give me the opportunity to put in my pics either vertically or horizontally. the binding is good and the pages turn easily. i have about 30 of these so i know these albmus well. it is difficult to find white ones anymore in local stores that used to sell them. they run the same price on the net as they do in local stores. they hold 300 pics unless you display them vertically, then it is 2 to a page instead of 3. i have never experienced any discoloration to the pictures from storing them in this album. the other colors that are nice are the wine/maroon and navy. There is a cheaper vesion that looks exactally the same, but it is not this ablum. it is poorly made, turns with difficulty and is not bi-directional,but it's difficult to distinguish from the other by the outside. the one you want is # BDP 35. enjoy!"
1,Wouldn't have purchased if I'd seen them first,"I bought these albums because they looked very similar to albums I already had (but were no longer in stock at a local store and I couldn't find them online). The plastic on each of the pages in these albums is all wrinkled instead of smooth like in our other albums. Also, once you have put 300 pictures in the album, the cover would not lay flat anymore like our others. Unfortunately I even bought 2 of these. I definitely would not buy them again. For the price, I expected them to be better quality."
4,"Nice album, but ""bi-directional"" is a not quite true","This is a nice heavy weight album. Classic cover. I like its 300 photo capability and binding type (large spiral, not the 3-ring type that always messes up). I plan to buy more. My only ""complaint"" is that it's not truly bi-directional. Vertical/portrait inserts only go in half-way; the horizontal separators block further insertion, making it hard to insert larger photos (over 4"" X 6""). Also, note that the seller's photo is wrong. The spine is rounded and marked with little ""inlaid"" gold floral designs, and front has inlaid gold rectangular outlines."
2,Defective album,"I have numerous Pioneer albums and they are all great. This one was defective, in that it was put together backwards. By that I mean you have to stand it upside down, with the word ""photo album"" upside down, in order to have the photos placed correctly, with the slot for the CD or DVD in the back. Too much hassle to exchange it, so I am living with it."
4,Great Music but really mellow towards the end,"I picked up this CD after being exposed to Eric Bibb on the Sisters & Brothers disc.This CD is really good and I like it. The one comment worth mentioning is that it gets pretty mellow half way through and slows down quite a bit.This isn't a CD full of foot stompin accoustic blues although it kinda starts out that way.It is still really good none-the-less. Since life is all about expectations, I thought it useful to let you know what you're getting: a great accoustic cd with soulfull delivery of bluesy/gospelly material."
5,Beatifully recorded acoustic blues,"A very pleasant experience - the full, strong voice of Eric Bibb backed by wonderfully recorded, intelligent acoustic guitar, harp and band. If you like Ry Cooder, Taj Mahal and GREAT hi-fi sound, this is a must."
2,One of your last purchases,This CD was patched together from several recording sessions; some of the tracks have sound so wretched they should never have seen the light of day. Some of the later tracks aren't bad at all and can almost make you forget the head-scratchingly atrocious sound of some of the earlier vocals. Make this one of your last Lightnin' purchases; there's much better stuff out there.
2,Not enough insert pages for the price,"The price of $7.99 for 5 pages of inserts holding 30 cards is way too much money! That's one roll of film's worth of photos.The only reason I consider it is I can't find them anywhere else.Anonymous, please"
3,Cute & Comical Christmas,"Rated G or PG, if you count that beer is consumed in a bar. This short relaxing book makes for stress relief reading during the holidays. Pick it up after the Thanksgiving dishes are done to bring on the Christmas mood. The action sometimes takes place too quickly due to the length of the book, but for a busy reader that can be a good thing. I love the scene in the theater and the feuding mothers trying to deliver Chritmas Baskets to the needy. This book shows that sometimes the need is not material. A little forgiveness covers a great multitude of sins. Fun."
1,My goodness...,Because it's not bad enough that I have to put up with stupid pop songs everytime I turn on the radio or MTV. NOOOO! They have to have KIDS sing the songs. Having 5 year olds sing Bowling For Soup is like having Geddy Lee sing death metal. DOESN'T WORK.
1,The World is Ending,"Okay, so my sister gets Kidz Bop and I put it on the radio. what's my reaction?i think i went temporarily deaf.and the desperate people who make this think that they can make it better by adding a sequel with different songs. think again.even the commercials burn my eyes.so what's my advice to you?save yourself and do not buy this."
1,Kidz Crap 7,"Why? Why does everything have to be 'hipped up' (Or hip-hopped up, as it were)?First of all, lyrically THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS. JUst because kids are singing it...doesn't make any less adult. Where's the fun happy stuff? Ok, everything doesn't have to be Laurie BErkner and The Wiggles...but how bout fun stuff ...like Yellow Submarine type material...do rock/pop but where's the fun? This Kidz Bop thing is terrible. Bad production, and bad music. Music for lazy parents perhaps, who don't 'wanna listen to that kid stuff'...so some parents convince themselves that this crap is ok. It's not. [...]"
1,jkflds,"'kidz bop' should die in a pit. All these bands degraded themselves to the status of ""corporate whore"" the moment they sold their songs to these low-life morons. This mainstream sh*t is terrible on its own, do they have to pollute it more with some bratty rich kids shouting the chorus's? I dare you to move had plenty of meaning, but these scumbags killed it. Oh, and 'my boo'? What tha f*ck is that? Whoever *cough* a computer *cough* wrote this has had a ravaging brain disease for several years. Thank you, amazon, for letting me get out my anger at these prostitutes. Burn, kidz bop, burn."
1,TERRIBLE!,"As an older teen, I am sure that I am less conservative than most parents, but I am still strongly against Kidz Bop for creating their remake of mostly inappropriate songs for kids. While I personally listen to a lot of these songs, I wouldn't have my child listen to them while Kidz Bop tries to pass itself off as something fun and child-friendly. Many of them have obvious sexual messages (sung by children, which i find disturbing) and themes that young children shouldn't have to deal with. From an teen's perspective, Kidz Bop has effectively ruined many songs for me; Every time I hear them sing on commercials I cringe. Kids should listen to their own age-appropriate songs. Just because kids are singing them doesn't make this okay for kids. Think about the bad influence of some pop music which regularly deals with drugs, sex, breakups etc. Do you want your five year old, completely unaware of what it's about, to sing along to this stuff?"
1,All I can ask is ...,"Is the point of these CD's about making annoying little kids sing in the background? Do kids find this appealing?Isn't ""Lose My Breath"" about sex?Do kids really know what to do in JoJo's case to tell their cheating, 6-year old boyfriends to leave cause they're cheating?Did they take Ashlee Simpson and digitally make her 10 years younger to re-record ""Pieces of Me""?Are little kids going to dress up like Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas after listening to ""Let's Get it Started""?It makes me wonder ..."
1,tey destoyed Feel Good Inc,What the heck was that?! They absolutely dstoyed Feel Good Inc! The kids bop people dont know what they were doing if they did that! They turned it into a crud heap of junky juked up junk! It nearly made my ears bleed! The Gorillaz rock and they dont. I am a BIG Gorillaz fan and am EXTREMLEY dissapointed.Those are my thoughts you can egree with them or not. It dosent matter to me.
1,Just as terrible as the rest,"Do not buy this CD if it's the last CD on earth. It STINKS!!! It's even worse because they're are quite a few songs on here which I really like the original versions of (Pieces of Me, Let's Get It Started, Breakaway, My Happy Ending, On the Way Down, and Beautiful Soul). Kidz Bop takes songs and totally ruins them! Don't artists have control over who does remakes of their songs? If I were Avril Lavigne with a chart topping single, I'd never give Kidz Bop permission to record it! And how in the world did they get Green Day's approval to do Boulevard of Broken Dreams for Kidz Bop 8? Personally, I love that song, and when I heard the sample, it was totally ruined! Which leads me to believe that Kidz Bop does NOT even get permission to record these songs! The songs are inappropriate for litte kids and the singers' voices are weak and whiny. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!!"
1,Kidz Bop 7? Just stop the insanity,"To be honest with all the customers, I practically had an ear aneurysm followed by a brain hemorrhage after hearing a few seconds of Kidz Bop. Honestly, I leave tightly packed products in my toilet that are more interesting and stimulating than this...If you are seriously considering purchasing this product, you should seriously consider investing in health insurance for your children too, as they might have seizures and fall into comas after hearing such densly packed crap emmitting from a speaker. Kidz Bop 7? Should have named it ""drink coaster #7 that doubles as a frisbee"""
2,There's No Point In These,"Yes, it's nice to have kid appropriate music. But, there's no point in having these songs re-recorded by a bunch of random people pulled off the streets. If you want these songs, buy the originals and burn them on a CD. However, I don't recommend teh ""Now"" series either, due to the fact that lately, they've been pretty bad, although the early installments are decent. The upcoming ""Now 18"" is horrible though, judging by its awful tracklisting. Don't waste your money on this."
1,I can't understand it.,"You say that this is better. I have yet to figure out how this ""CD"" is better. The songs are the same. They're awesome. The kids who sing them aren't. They can't sing. They have no range.What is wrong with the songs sung by the original artists? Some of these songs shouldn't even be remade for kids by these ""singers."" (For example, from album 8 of this series, Boulevard of Broken Dreams.) They're whiny, prepubescent, they sound even worse than Simple Plan. And, according to the review before this one, if children are our future, then we're doomed.And I still don't understand what is wrong with the original song."
1,JUST SHUT UP!!,"The one star is only because my son likes this CD (he's only 3). I absolutely HATE it but, since I bought it, I have to live with the torture until I can find a way to ""accidentally"" lose the thing... It's the most annoying piece of garbage ever! I won't repeat everyone else's comments but please trust all these reviews and save yourself the agony!"
1,These are not songs for little kids,"Kids badly singing songs innapropriate for them. What a waste of money. They can't sing, but insist on doing so and changing the songs.For Example:In ""Lose My Breath"", the chours says ""Make me lose my breath"" twice then says ""make me lose me"" followed by breathing sounds. The kids say ""Ha Ha"".?Also, random ""Yeahs"" are added into pauses of the ""singer""."
1,Are you proud of this?!?!?!,"Are you proud of this mess?? At the age of 11, I LOVE music. I thought kidz bop would be fun. They have lots of songs I like, like:1985Rich GirlBreakawayBoulevard of Broken DreamsBeautiful Souland more! Turns out, I was totally wrong. I've read 75, yes 75 reviews, and they all said that they stink. I believe then! What's wrong with Kidz Bop?! Don't you know you can't curse in front of little kids?? The world will be burned to cinders if this goes on! Please kidz bop, no more!The bottom line is------ DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! Sheesh!"
1,"Yes, it may be for small children...","I see some reviews stating: ""Oh, but it's for KIDS!"" Yes, that may be. But, the original versions of the songs were not made for children. So why make a crappy, new version of it, sung by underdeveloped Sunday School choir voices?I mean, seriously! It's almost mocking those songs. Most of the songs [correct me if I'm wrong] weren't even that ""dirty"" in the first place! If you want children's music, buy them ORIGINAL CHILDREN'S MUSIC. These CD's are garbage, IMO.[also many others]A mockery."
1,BAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,They ruined my favorite song!They made it in to a choir song!Breakaway is my favorite song and they ruined it! Boycott Kidz Bop! A lot of other people's favorite songs were too!They suck!They ruin peoples songs! I feel bad for the artists being insulted like that! Boycott Kidz Bop!
4,It's not that bad,"Hi. I'm 12 and to tell the truth I love Kidz Bop. I have Kidz Bop 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, two Kidz Bop christmas albums, the halloween album, and the DVD. Sure their voices may not be the best in the world, but their kids! Who are they suppposed to sound like? Kelly Clarkson? Jesse McCartney? (who i hate) No! Don't you people understand? It's for KIDS! I think these CD's are great. And if some of you still have a problem with that, than OH WELL. Kids all over the US, buy these CD's. They will provide hours of entertainment for you and your friends.*********************PEACE EVERYWHERE*********"
1,why?,"maybe i don't understand this series of kid's albums because i unfortunately, had to grow up on my parent's harsh beatles records... so, i end up feeling badly about this kid's album in two ways: (1)sorry for children raised in households that willingly subject them to this, and (2) disgust at pop cultural soul rot. this makes more sense as a parody album for drunk adults than something honest for kids. why does everything have to be dumbed down in order for it to be marketed towards children? if you want your children to be raised on wonder bread and think like a loaf of the same, play'em this. if something is true to the human condition it doesn't have to be targeted toward a particular demographic; it would appeal on some level to everyone. there's no way to prevent your kids from physicaly growing up, but this sure can retard their mental development. just make sure to put ""my boo"" on repeat. oh yeah, and i think walmart sells thongs with cartoon themes."
1,Forgetting the big picture,"Lets not forget the big picture here!!! Kids Bop CDs are full of songs that are written for ADULTS not kids. Who came up with the idea to let kids sing songs with adult issues and thought it would be cute!! NOT ME!!!! Every time I hear a Kids Bop commercial, I want scream! I think it's sick and wrong to hear little kids sing about ""dissing"" guys etc...I agree with a previous entry, buy something intended for kids in the first place. If you allow your children to grow up too quickly,,,they will."
1,"Kidz Bop Kids - Might Be By Kids, but Definately Not For Kids","Well, my ears hurt now.Kidz Bop Kids just can't do it. They can't sing very well; their recordings of the songs often stray from the music itself; and the lyrics are rarely the same.I understand the purpose of Kidz Bop Kids is to sell CLEAN versions of popular songs, but it is possible (especially with iTunes) to buy clean verisons of the songs sung by the real singers. A ""bleep"" is much better than a half-thrown attempt to replace a swear word with something sounding similar or ""criminal record"" with ""school record.""What is wrong with singing ""criminal record says I broke in twice"" anyways?"
2,AWESOME,"I wanted to give this zero stars, but this is just too hilarious. Take a whole bunch of crappy, mainstream, sell-out media whores and completely butcher their bop/pop hits. Next time someone tells me Simple Plan is real punk, I'll tell them to pick up a copy of this album and let them here the ""kidz"" remix of Welcome to My Life. I get a kick out of hearing this and seeing the reactions from radio listeners as their ""Numba one hit"" is completely demolished. Mainstream music has sunk to a new low with this and I love it! As long as they stay away from real music like Zeppelin, Sabbath, Maiden, Old Metallica, Ramones, Sex Pistols and the best punk rock band of all time NoFX, then its all gravy.(...)"
1,excuse me?,"ok ""ante"" how can you tell parents to buy this cd when u say that the people who write cruddy reviews should burn in hell? this is supposed to be 'cleaner' music (sure, whatever) so chill out u wacko. i'm mad cause i just saw a commercial for kidz bop 8 with gwen stefani on it AND Green Day (what's THAT about?) I nearly lauhged myself into a coma, it was that stupid."
1,This is STUPID,"This album as great songs but instead of the original artists, it has these off-key seven-year-olds. I bet they don't even know what thier saying. If you want a good album with great songs, buy the original artist buy the NOW series or the EMMY NOMINEES."
5,A Gift From God,This album would get six stars if it could. Owning this album is as priceless as the faces on your friends when they realize that Modest Mouse's Float On is being covered by the Kidz Bop Kids. Many other Kidz Bop albums can similarly delight or rivolt. Which makes them incredible.
1,*Vomits* This....is awful.,"I agree with Scott. THIS CD SUCKS!! I didn't buy it, but I listened to the clips. Just a bunch of high-pitched, off key kids who ruin decent songs. Worst of all, they are making a Kidz Bop 8. God help us all! What's next, Kidz Bop: Golden Oldies? Kidz Bop: Country? Kidz Bop: Rap? Kidz Bop: Christian Hits? Kidz Bop: Michael Jackson??If you actually buy this CD, break it, cut yourself with it, and wonder why you bought this piece of crap in the first place."
1,"Peice, correction: peices of crap","Kidz bop, actually, ALL the kidz bops suck. They turned ""peices of me"" by ashlee simpson into ""peices of CRAP"" it was like the reverse of King Mitus: everything the Kidz Bop Kidz sing turns to garbage. I actually liked the songs they sung before. I repeat:BEFORE. Or atleast before Kidz Bop sang it. They messed up pretty much every song and gave that songwriter a bad name. this CD sux you are better off listening to Radio Disney. When I heard my cousin's Kidz Bop CD, I was laughing sooo hard, I could hardly breath afterwards. However, this song is good for the little children who want to here current music, but their oarents wont let them get a certain CD because it has a parental advisory sign on it. EVER HEARD OF A CLEAN VERSION???!!!so i DONT suggest this CD to ANYONE."
4,genius? i think so.,"All these reviews are talking so much crap about this cd. But i think it's absolutely great for a bunch of kids to turn, for the most part, horrible pop songs into something really awesome.Listening to this cd makes me want to dance. And just giggle and smile a lot, and just remember how fun it was being a kid.Stop taking it so seriously, this cd is SO much fun. Sit back and enjoy it!"
1,to gay for anyone,"this music is horrible it ruins many good songs, and i have a message for college boy, i dont know if u were high or if thats a joke cause sh*t get a life and move out of your moms house and for the love of god get laid"
1,Oh Kidz Bob Kidz... Please spare us!,"A little known fact:Nobody actually buys these CDs. If you actually pay for one, you get a letter that tells you that you are a fool for wanting this CD. And that you cannot ever ever in a million gazillion years have a refund.The bottom line:Do not participate in the scam. If you think you may enjoy the songs on the CD (which, remember, does not exist) go out and buy the albums from the actual artists! Because they have talent! Do you realize that Elmo could be a kidz bop kid? He could be the lead singer! Oh, and you really can't call this a CD. It is more of a shiny disk with annoying brats screaming on it.Little known fact #2:There will be a Kidz Bop 8. It will also be annoying. Do not buy it under any circumstances. You will regret it."
1,Kidz Bop ALWAYS [0 stars],"not worth any price, if you want to buy this cause you like the music, then BUY it from the person who actaully sang the song in the first place, and that would probably sound SO much better than some nine year old kids singing it instead. i don't wanna hear kids singing it? do you? it's so annoying. dont buy this, please just don't buy it, anything else is BETTER than this. it really is just a big kick in the face to the music world. appreciate the people who did it in the first place, instead of some young kids, who have no idea what any of lyrics mean."
1,DOG CRAP!,"If you are even thinking about buying this for your kid, DON'T. And please reconsider! I'm a kid, and I would absolutely die if I had this CD. This CD is just as bad as Brittany Spears and Eminem. Some of these songs have horrible meanings that I'm sure no sane parent would want their children to listen to! Not only did they ruin the original songs, and destroyed the hard working artists original pieces, but they had to go and have tone deaf kids along with several tone deaf adults sing these songs and make people suffer. Please do NOT buy this for ANYONE!!! IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!-Mokuren"
1,This MUST be a joke.,"Ok, so we've got a bunch of stupid brats singing inappropriate songs with sugestive lyrics, with only a few minor changes, and their parents providing even worse backup lines. So what's next? Are they gonna sing something by Pretty Ricky?! Or Nas?!!! They sung Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" and Avril Levigne's ""Sk8ter Boi"" and a few songs by Evenescence which are inappropriate. Buy the NOW series instead. You can hear the real artists who made the songs instead of a bunch of little brats and their sheltering parents.Mike Morrison"
3,Shinier than I thought and the python is just a print,"I ended up giving these to a friend, because they were much shinier than I expected, and the pyton was not textural but just a printed pattern. I felt like I was wearing a mylar balloon on my feet. Ran true to size for me. 8.5 with narrow feet and long toes."
5,LOVE these shoes!,"These shoes arrived so quickly - 6 days earlier than promised! They fit perfectly - I am a 7.5 and they are true to size. Too cute for words, and comfortable too!"
5,"Comfy, Comfy, Comfy!","I ordered these because I love Sperry's boat shoes and I also wanted to be stylish. One of the best purchases ever!!!!! They fit like a glove and I haven't been able to take them off since they arrived. Super Duper speedy delivery, who could ask for more?"
3,Love the shoe but get a bigger size,I have loved dock sides since I was a little girl and recently had to buy a pair for my daughter. I bought her an 8.5 and 9 not knowing what size would fit. Kept the 9 even though the shoe fit length wise it was too tight around the enitre foot in general. To really enjoy these shoes you need to wear them for 2 weeks straight to really break them in. My daughter wore them to school (with only wearing them off and on for a week prior) and found herself taking them off while in class because they hurt her feet. But after several wears and the shoes are now broken in they fit great. So just be prepared - you will need to break them in or maybe buy them one size up from your normal shoe size.
2,Runs 1 size bigger,My daughter wears a 9 usually sometimes a 9.5. These 9s were at least an entire size too big so back they went.
4,they look better online,they were cute but not too girly as I expected. i tried wearing them around the house and they were comfortable but I didn't keep them because they did not look as good as I hoped for.
4,Great Simple Shoe!,I love these shoes! I wear them every day through rain and sunny weather. They hold up very nicely and match everything I have. The only downer is that breaking them in hurt a bit...overall great shoe to add to your collection!
2,Sent the wrong color,"This was my second try with the company. The first pair were too small--not the company's problem, but then on this order they sent the wrong color. Also had a problem w the return of the first pair.....but that's part of another review."
3,sperry top-sider shoes,"article like presented, however they are NOT as comfortable as I was lead to believe, and it is very hard to find a ""no-show"" sock with it. Again, Amzaon took unusally long to ship - ordered the same shoe from Endless.com - which is powered by Amazon, had them in 48 hours, this order took 4 days"
5,Love these shoes!,These shoes are some of my favorites! I love the metallic color and the shoes are really comfortable. I can wear them with almost anything.
5,Awesome product!,I could practically live in these shoes during the summer. Slip them on - dress them up or down (although they tend to lean more towards the casual side.) Highly recommend if you're looking for a basic shoe that goes with just about everything!
2,"Though Sperry motto is ""Get Wet""... Not Waterproof","These ""boat"" style shoes are not waterproof though the leather seems to have a water-repellent coating.Why the boat shoes are not waterproof:After about three wearings, the plastic bottoms start to get slightly loose from the leather part in the front.Therefore, if you walk around water or rain, water comes in the front part of the shoe so that the leather footbed under the ball of the foot will be wet. When this occurs, it takes several hours to dry.I have tried the Sperry Authentic Moccasins in both classic white bottom as well as Sahara color and have had the same issue."
5,The best peeler I've ever used,"I bought one of these peelers a while back and now want another for the times when one is in the dishwasher, in use elsewhere or whatever. I've probably got four or five peelers in the kitchen drawer but this is the only one that my husband or I will use. One day I'll get round to yard saling the others!"
2,Read by Kimberly Schraf,"Powells Books indicates that the title designated by this ISBN is read by Kimberly Schraf and that its ""Media Run Time"" is 120 (presumably minutes)."
1,Waste of money!,"This product is a total waste of money. The ring is so uncomfortable and does nothing but cause bruises. If you decide to order, do not order from the company directly as they will give you a ""free"" upgrade to the automatic monthly shipment of their vitamin supplement. When you call to try to cancel the ""free"" $26 per month service, you are left on hold forever and when it finally gets through you are hung up on. This company needs to be put out of business!"
3,So far it's ok,"I've only used this once so far, but I've already noticed that the floor mat is just about worthless. It is very cheap and my feet kept sticking to it, making it difficult to complete a move. However, I can definitely say that the workout itself seemed really great! I felt the burn the entire time. And while the instructor isn't what I'd call model perfect, she actually appeals to me more because she seems a little bit more ""normal"". We'll see what results I'll get over time!"
3,Felt Results The First Time - Happy,"I used my Zone Pilates today and I can already feel my muscles responding. I have no reports of bruising, the ring is very comfortable for me. I am not an exercise junkie, but I do like to maintain a sensible diet with a couple of blow out days during the week. I was surprised at how quick the routine was, so I did both DVD's to feel more of a burn. I have done Winsdor Pilates, which is great also, but wanted to try something new. I think I will be happy, but will follow up in 30 days for a full report."
4,The Zone,"I've had the Zone Pilates for about 5 months and just started using it 3 weeks ago. I have noticed a difference in my clothes fitting although I've only lost 1 pound. The commercial claims you only need to use it 20 minutes 3x a week which is all I have been doing it. The excercises are very beginner but the tape includes an advanced section. The instructor is not annoying and she moves quickly through the routine. THe first day after I first used it, I could barely walk! Everything was so sore but now I have no problems. Its getting over the initial soreness. I would recommend this to anyone who is out of shape and wants to start out slow. I usually hate excercise but I have had no problem staying motivated to do this!"
2,Not so happy...,"I just got mine 3 days ago. I can see that it might help toning the areas. And the video is not annoying. What is a problem is the WONDERFUL bruising on my legs where the device sits for the workout. I didn't purchase this item for weight loss, I thought it would help for toning. But the bruises, while they may go away with continued use, are not worthe the $$. I am sending mine back today. Sorry!"
3,not too please,"Price paid is not worth it when you can get the ""Everlast for Her Pilates Fitness Ring with DVD"" here at amazon for only $14.99 or the ""Bally Fitness Ring for Pilates with DVD"" $17.99 Both are very identical to this zone pilates and eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25.The shipping charges alone on this were close to $15 I would suggest looking at the other first to save money. They all do the same thing in the long run!"
1,Not Worth It,This is one of the worst investments I have ever made. I have been using it for a few months now and all I have to show for my time and effort are bruises!!!
1,Not what they used to be,"The older Topsiders of were fantastic. They are also great when new.Relying on reviews of very old, and of brand new Top-Siders won't get you the information you need.The soles of these shoes are ""made in China"" trash. Mine were completely worn out after 10 wearings, and one sole had a giant crack in the flex area. You will do better buying the fake ones at WongMart than this expensive junk."
5,Mmmm - delicious!,"Fantastic! Makes the best blood-orange margaritas and martinis ever... and mixed in with a bit of key lime and pineapple juice and a pinch or two of spices, a wonderful Carne Asada style marinade!The frozen concentrate is ultra-easy to use, and a wonderful way to keep fresh-tasting juice that's normally pretty hard to find, close at hand! :)Super-fast and courteous shipping by seller, too! First-rate!"
4,Delicious margaritas,"While more of a puree than a juice concentrate, this wonderful product did exactly what it was purchased to do .. it produced an awesome margarita! Deliciously different, blood orange margaritas make for a wonderful summer drink. I would buy this product again."
2,The Toxicity of Nazi Antisemitism,"This book is truly a shocking exposure to the depths of the Nazi hatred of the Jews. Each chapter is dedicated to a detailed exposition on an antisemitic stereotype. What is even more disturbing about it is that this is a book intended for children. It is written in the classic style of children's book with magnificently executed elaborate illustrations. Here we witness not just the depths of the Nazi hatred but also their great skill in poisoning the minds of the very young.As for the particular product itself, I must say that I was disappointed. I have seen an actual edition of this book on display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (of course in the original German). Several years ago, I was able to print out a full color copy of it, in English translation, from a neo-Nazi website. However, when I received this copy of the book, I found it to be a very poor reproduction, small and in black and white. Frankly, I felt ripped off."
4,Works but....,"Product works, but the comb is cheap and breaks long before the product is used up. Secret is to make sure its wet before using."
1,Not what was advertised,I ordered a cover your gray color comb .33 oz as advertised rather than a cover your gray wand .25 oz. This is either a mistake or a rib-off. Which?
1,turned my hair pink,Don't use it. Turned my hair pink (I had the auburn one and I have white roots).Grey Free is a much better product!
3,Gray coverage for the day,"In the short term, this product is satisfactory. If you need to color your hair and can't get to it before tonight's dinner, you can cover reasonably well for the evening. By tomorrow, don't plan on it being there any more, even without washing your hair."
1,mascara-like brush,"This is mentioned in the review for light brown-blonde color also. This is easy to apply. I purchased in a local store for twice the cost on Amazon. However, I bought dark brown which is great. I would not order the medium brown again.The medium brown looks like cream paste with a pinkish tinge, far from blonde. I'll stick with the Dark Brown."
1,Doesn't work well at all,"I remembered seeing this in a store on Los Angeles years ago, before I colored my hair. It seemed like and easy way to touch up roots between colorings. I looked online and found it. I have tried it several times and it just doesn't work. A teeny tiny bit of color transfers to the hair and it washes out with the first washing. I guess I'll have to use the messier root touch up products instead."
2,a little disappointed,"George Clinton is an amazing musician and live performer, which is why I was surprised I didn't like this CD more. My complaint is this: This CD is a compilation of George Clinton's greatest hits performed live, but they are not all from the same concert. It left me with a choppy and inconsistent feeling. When I buy a live CD of any artist I want the whole show, not one song from a show. If I wanted a bunch of hits I would have bought a greatest hits album. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of good songs on this CD. But I reccomend buying a greatest hits package, and not this scattered live album, if that's what you're looking for."
4,Marine Combat Correspondent,"Stavisky's book is a must read for those who care about WWII, providing the view of the enlisted man who folks back home would know and care about. It has the authentic ring of the writing and ethics of that time in history, and does more than hint at the actual horrors faced in jungle combat, yet still treating the war as a crusade.While the tone is authentic and detailed, there are a few editorial lapses that knock the book down from 5 stars for me. For example, in one paragraph Stavisky states that Enterprise had been sunk a year earlier (which of course it had not been) and in another, states that Chesty Puller led the Marines into Korea in ""1955"". Presumably, he means actually during the Korean War, which ended in 1953. While these type of errors do not disqualify the book, they disfigure it and make one wonder what else the author has wrong.Recommended with this reservation."
5,Brings to mind the place-you-there style of Ernie Pyle.,"This paperback-only gem, a collection of first hand combat journalism, just came out and what a fine read it is. It presents Sgt. Stavisky's historically important news reporter accounts of USMC World War II actions in the Solomons, and his personal reflections on dodging death and jungle diseases along the way.The perfect beach landings beach read."
1,Need more information about the product before buying!,"It might have been nice if someone had told me that the book was written in Spanish. Yo no hablo en espanol, Amazon. Except I do know a few cuss words, and I was sorely tempted to make use of them as I sat down to enjoy my new Diana Palmer book only to find it was all in another language! It's all Greek--Er, Spanish--to me!"
3,It was OK,"I was hoping for something that would show me more about dealing with photo enhancements rather than making graphic images. I did learn some things that helped me; but I will keep looking for a better PSPX book. The ""how to"" instructions were quite good for the examples; but I was hoping for more."
3,Corel Paint Shop Pro X Revealed,Very good book for a beginner to paint shop pro. Not something I would recommend for someone that has been using paint shop pro. I found it very basic and I had only been using PSP for a few months.
3,BETTER GET THE EXTENDED WARRANTY,"I bought the scanjet 4400cse scanner 4 months ago. It just quit (conviently after the 3 month warranty expired, probably built in planned obsolescence). No mercy from HP.It performed fairly well, except the IRIS OCR was [unsatisfactory]. I bought FineReader Pro 5.0 OCR, which works wonderfully."
4,"Good for space saver, overweight issue?","This is perfect if you have space problems maybe at home, or if you want to keep things separated in your luggage, but now the issue when traveling is not the space but the weight, so maybe you have more space in your luggage but cannot put anything else because you go over the limit in weight, just watch out for that, you dont want to pay hundreds in overweight..."
2,Noisy,"If you like BTO, get something else. This CD is very noisy and unpolished. Now I like live music as much as the next guy, but this recording is sloppy, and some of the cuts are noisy with too much distortion.Besides that the band plays their top songs excellently, and the emotional excitement of a live performance is captured on all the tracks (with the exception of Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet which you wouldn't even guess was a live performance).BTO's music is straight ahead - nothin' fancy or clever. I wouldn't call it ""art"". It's straight ahead, foot stompin', good time jams. Many of the rhythms are easy to play on the guitar and good for a beginning guitar student to play along with which is why I got this CD. It suits my purposes."
1,Junk,"I purchased the 8"" model to speed up the sanding process on large timber beams. I was very disappointed. When I started using the sander I found it very difficult to control as it vibrated a lot. I decided to call customer service to see if there was something wrong with this unit or not, but they never called me back after I left a message with an actual person. In the mean time I kept using the sander until the pad tore loose from the motor. This macine felt very cheaply constructed for its price. It was about the same quality as I expect from Harbor Freight tools. Also the on/off switch is in a terrible location. Thanks to Amazon and its great customer service for allowing me to retun it for a full refund as it was clearly defective."
4,"Awsome sander, but...","I just got this sander, and have been able to use it on some red oak. By far this is the best ROS I have ever used - and I have many hours logged with ROS. This sander can be very aggressive, but it is very easy to control, and gives very precise action. I put most of my 220 lbs. on it and it didn't chock for a second. There was almost no vibration, and my hands did not tingle after a few hours of use. Also, I have never seen better dust extraction. PERIOD!Now to why it did not get 5 stars from me.1) No case. At this price you think you would get a case.2) Poor doccumentation. Mine came with two manuals. Both were safety oriented, and not use or operation oriented.3) The dust collection outlet is propietary. It is an odd shaped rectange, forcing you to use a hard to find Fein adapter, or make one yourself.4) Cost.However, because of the preformance of this unit, I mostly have been able to overlook these problems. I am thinking of buying their 8"" model next."
1,Not for the average reader,I am having to read this book for a class I am taking. I would not advise a person to try reading this book without a dictionary.
4,An awesome beginner commentary!,This commentary on Genesis is a very helpful beginner commentary on the book. It is deep enough for Bible Students but it is written in a way that any new believer could follow along! I highly recommend it!
2,Very Disappointed,"I had read various reviews from different sources and thought this might be a great addition to my library on Genesis; however, I was disappointed. I have Waltke's work in NICOT on Proverbs and it is excellent but I wasn't pleased with this commentary. It's very brief for Genesis and it's internal layout with the various 'acts' and scenes were not helpful for me. I then purchased Kenneth Matthews in the NAC and was EXTREMELY pleased! It is a 2 volume work that does Genesis justice in every way. I also have Ross's 'Creation & Blessing' which is also good, an older commentary by HC Leupold which is fine, The Genesis Record by Henry Morris which is a good devotional type commentary, but Matthews is fantastic. I definitely recommend going with the NAC instead. It's depth is wonderful while staying extremely readable. It's MORE than worth the extra money."
5,Ickle Bickle Robin,I bought this Scholastic paperback when my two oldest girls were in kindergarten. I had a three year old and a one year old at home. We read that book so many times that we totally wore it out. I smoothed out the pages and stored them in a manila envelope. My kids now have kids so I took the pages out and laminated them. I put them in a small notebook so the pages could be turned easily and we began reading. The next generation enjoyed it just as much as their Moms did. It was one book that my husband loved to read to them. He got just as much enjoyment out of it as the kids and I did. I am now going to buy a used hardback so that we can make it through the next several generations.
4,helluva read!,"David M. Dibble's storytelling is energetic & imaginative. TYPHOON RISING takes you into the Japanese Secret Service where the scenery is spectacular, the ladies are lethal, & the evil is satisfyingly sinister.Rebeccasreads recommends TYPHOON RISING as a rip-snortin' entertaining read!"
4,Sweet & Emotional,"This book written early in her career under a psuedonym and republished under her name and a new cover.....is a good book but lacks the maturity of her later writings. However, it was refreshing and an easy read."
2,modified,"This cd was very dissapointing, it's not really bad but I have heard a lot better.""Mistaken"" is good but, I'm sorry I just can't stand ""One more try""."
3,Over-Produced but Great Live,"As a big fan of Save Ferris, I anxiously awaited the arrival of ""Modified"" The first time I plopped it in the CD player my heart sank. What happened to the horns? The simplicity of the old stuff is gone, replaced with overproduced noise (record scratching for crying out loud!)After listen to the album a couple of dozen times, the songs did grow on me. This is a good alternative/pop album, but not a ska album.However, these guys rock live. When I heard the new stuff next the old stuff live, I new nothing changed. Turns out these songs do have a horn part!Mo is better than ever! Next time guys, get the old producer."
4,"Different from It Means Everything, but still good.....","I think that Save Ferris moved away a little too far from ska/punk. Modified is a really good cd, but it doesn't sound like the old them. If you liked the old style, this may or may not be the cd for you."
4,"Not the best, but still good","I admit I was a bit disapointed. When I heard Mistaken on the radio I was so excited to buy the CD. I expected song similar to songs from the last album, but I think they tried to changed their style to something more like No Doubt. I like the sound, but I still liked their old ska sound better."
3,"Good, but should have been better.","I really enjoyed the first Save Ferris disc, _It Means Everything_. It was catchy, upbeat, and lighthearted. _Modified_ doesn't quite meet my (admittedly high) expectations. They've stepped away from the ska sound a bit (there is notably less brass on this album), turning out something more like a pop-punk album with ska influences. There are plenty of good songs, but no excellent, gotta-hear-it-again songs."
3,Ack! What Happened???,"After It Means Everything, I wanted more! Unfortunately, this is not what I wanted. This cd isn't bad and I'd still rather listen to it instead of pop radio. Modified just doesn't have the driving sound of the first one. Oh well, I'll load up on Less Than Jake and Me First and The Gimme Gimmes while I wait for another attempt by Save Ferris. Monique, please don't let me down next time!"
2,Not what I expected!!,I was very excited about getting this CD only to be let down. They changed their whole style to punk. Ska is what they did best!!!
4,No Complaints; An Excellent Sophomore Follow-Up,"Do you like No Doubt, Letters to Cleo, Reel Big Fish or even (slight stretch) the Barenaked Ladies? If so, there isn't a chance you won't just flip over Modified, or the band who owns it's rights. You will probably also run out and buy ""It Means Everything"" and note, idly, that the two albums are quite different, but not so much so that you dont recognize their core sound. Both albums are great, and truly if I had to pick my favorite of the two, I like Modified better, not because it's any better or because its more ska or whatnot; i believe it's a personal choice. Either album would be a good introduction to Save Ferris."
4,so it's not IT MEANS EVERYTHING. doesn't mean it's not good,"yes, it's true, it's not IT MEANS EVERYTHING. then again, does that mean that the album isn't good? hell no! MODIFIED is one of the few albums that i could listen to without having to pick immediate favorites. the first time i went through the album, i didn't even touch the ""next"" button on my CD player. yeah, it certainly is a departure from their first album, no doubt there. however, all bands have different albums that show growth, maturity, and just a variety of ways to express their music. that's what MODIFIED is for Save Ferris. not bad, just different. favorite songs: mistaken, holding on"
2,Boring,"I really liked their last CD and thought they rocked at Warped a few years back, but this is definately not the same band now. They dropped their previous style and picked up the same radio-forumula for music as used by millions of other pop bands out there. I returned it the next day."
4,Different but still a good CD,"When I first bought Save Ferris's ""It means everying"", I thought it was a great cd. I was thinking that modified would be great as well. It was ok. It was mostly pop then ska. The songs were still enjoyable but it didn't get my attention like there previous stuff did."
2,"Why, Why, Why",I can't belive they Changed their look. It means Everything was a happy Album And this one is an sorry attempt at rock/alternitive. Why? Why? Why? And where did the Bear Hat go? Big Mistake!
3,ska is better than pop,"I don't see why such a cool ska band would want to turn pop. Their last cd was great and pop is the worst kind of music. However, this cd still isn't bad.They definitely aren't to the BsB/Britney Spears point.. and hopefully they never will be. I agree with the person who said that No Love is a watered down version of Lies.. it sounds the same. The best of this cd is Turn It Up, Your Friend, Angry Situation, and Modified (hidden track). Most of the songs are mediocre like The Only Way to Be, I'm Not Crying For You, Let Me In, etc. And then there is One More Try which is in my opinion their way of using up an extra track. In conclusion, this cd is ok but if they keep singing pop, they won't be good anymore."
2,HOWLING II,"This movie is really bad, although the women are hot except when they are hairy and turn into wolves. Christopher Lee at least makes it half-watchable. The Howling I is way better. This one is so bad I don't remember ever seeing it on tv. Until I saw it recently somewhere else."
3,"""STIRBA"", ""STIRBA,"" ""STIRBA""",Man I Would Say That This Movie Is Ok For A Sequel A Little Strange But I Don't Know It's Something About This Movie I Can't Say What It Is Maybe It's Seeing Sybil Danning Rip That Top Off (Damn Baby!) But Anyway It's A Ok Movie But It Damn Sure Doesn't Hold A Candle To The Original Howling
2,Eh...,"On a completely different level than the first Howling -- more like another planet, to be honest. This uses the barest thread of the original to jump into a story about some strange, kinky werewolf cult led by the topless Sybil Danning in Transylvania, and Christopher Lee's attempt to destroy it. It does have a couple of scary moments, not-bad though very brief makeup effects, also some well-done locations, production design, and photography (and a heavy use of New Wave-y music on the soundtrack if you're into that); this is sabotaged by wooden acting from almost everybody involved, a REALLY idiotic script which either makes no sense or seems as though it came from a comic book, and some really strange, choppy editing that renders a few parts incoherent. Also a couple of overly disgusting moments and an end-credit recap that has to be seen to be believed. No great shakes but never boring (just stupid)."
2,A real howler,"The Howling 2 is a real let down to the original Howling. It does not even come close to capturing the same beastly terror. The brilliant special effects of the Howling 1 is what made that film so special. In part 2 the special effects have gone backwards, they are infact a laughable attempt. Sybil Danning's fleshy expose is the best thing about this film. Its a total disrespect to the original."
3,M.F. fom south Arkansas.,Howlling 2 is not on the same level as the original.The effects are subpar you don't really see the werewolves up close.It is a scary movie the first time you watch it but if you watch it more than once you will notice the poor scenes.I gave it three stars because Christipher Lee is in it.
1,Poor follow up,"What can I say about this ""sequel""? Boring, contrived, and just plain AWFUL. The movie wouldn't be as ridiculous as it was, if it had less mundane dialogue and some genuine, non-forced scares, at the minumum. Christopher Lee could've have an non-contrived role in this movie. Avoid this at all costs and get the first one. It's a heck of a lot scarier (not to mention funnier) than this weak, contrived ""sequel.""Rated R for language, nudity, and some werewolf violence and gore."
1,garbage.,"If you spent money on this, i feel sorry for you. But i do like the Theme and the Dryhumping scene. Aswell as the The Incredibly Sexy and erotic Werewolf Orgy."
1,"Watch instead the original ""The Howling""","This is one of the all time worst sequels. Unbelievable what is Christopher Lee doing in it. Maybe you should see for laughing or to learn how can an original tremendous movie be followed by a almost non-related sequel (note that the name of this movie doesn't have ""The"" as the original had). It is a shame that ""The Howling"" (Joe Dante, 1980) was not re-released in VHS (in a letterbox format for instance) or released in DVD. Well, ""Howling II"" is still a werewolf movie and a Christopher Lee movie..."
1,Doggy-Doo,"This film is as bad as the first Howling film was good. The plot is so hackneyed and predictable that you start to pray it will get it over with soon. I understand that the author of the original book was angry that Joe Dante changed the plot for Howling 1. This film is said to be closer to his original vision. All I can say is thank god that Dante altered it.See Dante's original, American werewolf in London, Ginger Snaps,Dog Soldiers, Underworld, anything but this. It's an embarassment to cinema."
1,One of the worst sequels ever made,"Its really bad, bad makeup design, awful storyline, akward scenes and big boobs flashing every second is basically this movie in a nutshell. Its nothing like the original and even on its own without comparision its just plan terrible. Its worth a watch just to laugh at how stupid it is."
2,This Movie Is Bad,"This movie is bad, so don't jump in the pool, unless you have money to burn. I waited a long time to get this on DVD. Yes, that means I have disposable income and am running out of options. However, this movie has a special place in my heart. I spent a lot of time in the 80's watching this steamer with my high school buddies and laughing our a**es off. We liked to riff on b-movies, MST3K style, and this movie was perfect for that. Watching this film again brings back very good memories. Some quick highlights:1) Lots of good wolf kills, albeit you have to sit through most of the movie to get to them.2) The Ina Klina twins getting eaten, very good camp humor.3) Christopher Lee, just being scary.4) Weird wolf sex, that I'm positive, introduced sexual dysfunction in one of my friends.Defiantly a good movie for teenagers that are board and stupid."
4,Another example of a great 80's horror film,"The first Howling film was meant to be a serious, scary horror film, and that it was. I think however, the sequals were just meant to be wild and outlandish werewolf movies and this one really is. It has nothing to do with the original plot but that dosen't matter anyway because the other sequals don't either. This movie has a really cheesey plot, and the acting is horrible in it (except for Christopher Lee), but I love it because of it's extreme 80's horror film charisma. The special effects are really good in it to."
5,Howling II- Your Sister Is A What?oh... WEREWOLF,"I have to be honest in all sencerity. this film is quite a thrill but also very humours in some places. Christapher Lee... the king of all vampires. plays Stephan Corsscoe a Werewolf hunter out to distroy Sturba... the qeeen of all werewolves in Transalvania. and like it's other 6 predecesors, I am delighted to say that it is a privlage to own all of these on VHS tape. the following is on DVD. THE HOWING. HOWLING II YOUR SISTER IS A WEREWOLF. HOWLING III: THE MARSUPIALS. HOWLING IV: THE ORIGINAL NIGHTMARE. HOWLING 5: THE REBIRTH. HOWLING 6: THE FREAKS. AND HOWLING 7: NEW MOON RISING on VHS ONLY. and I will be ordering right away if and when it comes out on DVD. as for part 2, I love it. the werewolf transformations are excellent. the cast is great."
1,may cause birth defect or other reproductive harm,"I bought this product of Vitamin Shoppe on Jan/30/2012. In the package, on the receipt it said: ""California Prop 65 Warning: The product above contains a chemical known in the state of California to cause birth defect or other reproductive harm"". I called immediately, can not get more information. Then I applied to return so far no response. I thinkVitamin Shoppe - Brewer's Yeast, 1000 tabletsVitamin Shoppe should give this warning on their AD, not on the receipt - that the customers already received the product. Y. Sun"
5,Good solder,I use this for small electronics applications and it works well. The solder has a low melting point which is nice in the fact that you do not need to overheat your component to make a solid solder connection.
5,Great solder,"I bought this because I needed to repair some electronics in the house. I've always used Kester solder because it's better than some of the cheap no-name solders out there. It seems to flow better, melt more evenly and give me a more consistent result than a couple of no-name solders I've tried. The difference in price is definitely worth it. You can find solder here for 2 bucks for .5oz, but that solder does not compare. If you need to solder something, do yourself a favor and buy Kester."
4,"Cool idea, good execution","Let me start by saying that, if I went through a lot of solder, this would not be enough. But I am a casual electronics guy, and only need to use this, say, once a week. It is a handy dispenser with a thin gauge wire, works great on PCBs. More compact than a normal roll of solder, and very light, it's a great portable roll for my butane soldering irons too. My only gripe: per ounce, rather expensive stuff. That said, I recommend this stuff. Would buy again."
3,Big Sister 2000,"I am a big Julie Strain fan but this is not one of her better movies. This movie is a little on the cheesie side to say the lest. There is a fair share of skin like in most of her movies. But the acting is pretty bad and the budget was pretty low as well. It would have been nice to have seen more of Jill Kelly nude, but oh well. You might be able to call it a cult classic depending on your tastes."
2,"Almost, but not...","Could have used a lot more female nudity! Full frontal at the beginning of the flick, but doesn't last long. Could have been so much more but can't recommend this flick. Julie Strain should have been naked the whole time. Would have been more convincing on her part. Oh well.Not Recommended!"
1,Horrible text,"While the illustrations are fair, the rhyming text for this book is just horrible. The rhymes are forced and sing-song. Even my nine-year old daughter groaned. The contrast between present manufacturing processes and those of the past is not made clear. Some of the illustrations are simply inaccurate--such as the drawing of the spinning wheel which would never be able to spin or to twist the thread."
4,Good Overview of Apes and Conservation,"This book contains good information for anyone who is interested in an overview of apes and conservation. It provides behavioral descriptions of the different ape species, and gives a good analysis of the many different issues affecting conservation in today's ape environments. I recommend this book for anyone with an interest in either apes or conservation efforts around the world."
1,Badly written,A book that is over the top and dictated by ego. This is an author who should stick to his patients and leave the writing to quilified authors. Such self promotion!
4,Just fun to read!,"Georgette Heyer has such a knack at producing stories that are fun to read, even though the story is usually quite predictible."
2,Lady of Quality,"This is Georgette Heyer at her most verbose. There are endless, as opposed to the usual many, passages describing the thoughts, dress, and surroundings of the main, secondary and even terciary characters. Most of them do very little to move the story along."
4,Matched wits,This is the kind of Heyer I like best: two evenly-situated characters matching wits. The male half of the central couple is much less clearly drawn than the woman--why is he such a rag-mannered rake?--but Annis is such a good one that much can be forgiven.
3,A fun romp in Bath,"Lady of Quality was the first Georgette Heyer that I've ever read, and it was a fun romp, if a little bit draggy at parts, especially since it is inevitable that Annis and Mr Carleton get together. It reminded me of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, but simpler, with fewer dimensions. Still, I'm interested in picking up more from Heyer. I loved the Bath setting and the feisty Annis, and it made for some pretty good light reading, especially in the midst of some heavy ones."
2,ok,"Wanted to add a rating more than a full review.I have read many GH books and, for me, this one was ok, but not one of her best stories."
5,Absolutely one of Heyer's best!,"Along with many of the reviewers, I admit that this is one of my very favorite of her books. I have read just about every single one of them and all more than once. Heyer's ability to create characters is not the least of her talent. Her stories are the ""comedy of manners"" type at its very best. Only Jane Austen wrote this kind of novel as well as (and maybe better) than Heyer. Today's Regencies do not even come close and sometimes they are so badly written I am surprised they even get published.But a note to reviewers: Please do not recount the story in your review, it is unnecessary. Give us your opinion, not your version of the tale. Please know what you are writing about (Heyer wrote in the Regency period, not the Victorian and women of both periods did not look lightly on men having mistresses because of any ""sexual liberation""--what a foolish statement and clearly made by someone with absolutely no knowledge of history.)"
5,Love Merrick's!,"Merrick's never fails to disappoint. I believe their high quality canned food helped my lab live 17 wonderful years, and now I am feeding my 3 month old lab puppy Merrick Puppy Plate. He loves the taste and so far has been very healthy."
2,I wouldn't buy it again.,"Too large of chucks for puppies. Whole foods can cause choking, also this food caused diarhea in my puppies."
2,"Two & 1/2 stars, really","Cedric's eccentric family is really at the heart of this story, and they're a terrific bunch of characters. Cedric is a fine leading man--humorous, attractive, caring, if not particularly exciting. He's just a good man. Emma starts out very stiff and dour as she tries to be wholly unremarkable. But Cedric sees past that facade. In fairly short order, Emma comes to care about the eccentrics who surround her. We don't get to see enough of this change, however. In fact, she almost loses Cedric because of her stubbornness.The really annoying thing about the book, which was perhaps explained in the first title, A Christmas wish, which I have not read, is why Emma is not received in society but her sisters are. If the sole rationale for Emma is her highwayman father, then it should apply to the other two ladies as well. This so irritated me that my true rating is 2 & 1/2 stars, when it might otherwise be three."
5,From the back cover:,"In Moral Classrooms, Moral Children, authors Rheta DeVries and Betty S. Zan draw on and extend the work of Jean Piaget into the realm of sociomoral development. The authors argue that constructivist education must involve more than the special activities with which it is commonly associated (such as group games, physical-knowledge and whole language activities). Planning must also include provision for children's social and moral development, since children construct their moral understandings from the raw material in their day-to-day social interactions. To this end the authors provide a rationale for a particular type of sociomoral atmosphere in the early childhood classroom and describe the practical ways in which teachers can cultivate it."
3,"Great tool, but ridiculous price","Almost $40, including shipping, for a little bitty blade. That is about the same as for a 10"" 40 tooth carbide tipped table saw blade. The Fein flush cut blade is a lifesaver for certain tasks, like undercutting door jambs when installing laminate flooring, but being severely price-gouged sure takes the fun out of a great tool. Hopefully someone will clone these and sell them for $10, and still make a decent profit."
2,Effective but fragile,"This blade cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter, but it is extremely fragile. I actually shattered mine when changing blades, not in actual use. The spring loaded mounting system snapped shut on the blade and it broke into several fragments. I own a lot of expensive tools and I take care not to abuse them, so I don't think this was a case of gross operator error. Disappointing for such an expensive blade."
1,Not fein's usual quality,This blade shattered around the hub after two uses. I liked the design but will not purchase it again.
5,Wood cutting blade,"I do really like the Fein Multimaster and have used it quite a bit. There are a variety of blades to use and this Flush Cut Blade is very useful. I was using it to cut door casings and also some shim stock from a door frame. Cut like butter, I was happy and surprised. I would recommend this blade as a general use blade and keep a spare for back up."
3,Speciality Tool,"If you have the specific need for this blade, it works great. They do wear out pretty quick, but like most Multi Master tools, they are built for specific tasks and get the job done when conventional methods & tools don't work."
1,Lasts about an hour,"I expected a lot more from the Fein tool, it would be one of the best tools I own but the blades are junk and expensive."
2,"Good tool, but lousy and expensive blades....","I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept, and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws, the cost, life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive, they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades, and improves the quality of the blades, that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight."
3,Way over priced.,Due to the interface of the Fein multimaster you have to buy the star version. The blade is way overpriced. The multimaster is a fine tool but I don't like the excessive profit on the accesories.
5,Got wood?,Fein products are really fine. There are substitutes out there but you can't beat the real McCoy for best performance
5,High seas adventure... it gets no better!,Mike Rittel has created a great book that's well written in his world of Asharia. I just love the sea faring Fantasy tales and this one is fantastic. This book also has a fold out map. A very cool feature that R&R (the publisher) has done with another book. They do really cool interior artwork as well. I'm checking out their other titles.
3,THe Million Dollar Duck,"It's really just okay. The times when the duck was actually shown were funny. Most of it was the father etc getting consumed with the love of money. The wife wasn't too smart. Rebellious ""teenagers"" who - SPOILER ALERT - nearly got the kid killed. It's a really dumb movie."
3,Ducky Dilema,This is a cute movie although not one of my favorites. You can really see the difference in the script writing then compared to now. Dean Jones and Sandy Duncan do a good job of acting.
5,Good Games fallen short,"Gunman is sadly one of those great games that never makes it big. The story line takes you to unexpected ends of the universe, once you depart from one planet, you never know where you might end up. The games difficulty is just so that you would rather keep playing after failling a mission rather then giving up for awhile. After playing for awhile and looking back at all youve shot your way threw and came across, you notice just how large and intense the game really is. The graphics arnt that off date and the game is really fun, a great buy for such a low price."
3,Almost...but not quite,"This had the potential to be a great game, but fell short. The other 3 three reviews on here are a bit harsh I think. If you can find this game... as I did, it is a very entertaining game. Being built on the Halflife engine is a plus too. I thought the female voice over of the computer lady was excellent and that the computer lady character itself was pretty cool too, but was kind of out place in this game's setting though. There needed to be more variety in the different levels of the game. It spent way too much time in the second area, the alien planet, than it should have, and too short of a time in the western area which was excellent in my opinion. But I have to say that the previous three reviews made this game sound a whole lot worse than it actually is. I enjoyed the game for what it was and I think most people who enjoy good entertaining fps games would probably enjoy this one too."
3,It's the same as Half-Life but with a good ending,"Since i'm a PC gamer i'd say this game is just the same as Half-Life , even my friend thought it was a level i designed for Half-Life , i was disappointed at first of the game but then i start to like it especially when you drive the tank in last few levels , considering Half-Life was (and still) a great game with a great story line you can't compare it to Gunman Chronicles cuz Half-Life is waaaay better than Gunman Chronicles , take my advice if you want the game try to download the demo before buying it cuz you may not like the game , by the way the only good thing in the game is that you'll get a quite good ending i mean in Half-Life you won't know what well happen to Gorden Freeman , but in Gunman Chronicles you'll see a good ending for a good game."
4,A good first person shooter,Gunman chronicles shows it's heritage from Valve. The game engine and graphics appear right out of half-life. There is a patch for 3dfx video boards. The patch provides open GL and glide support. The AI is better than half-life. Characters have a greater ability to move with the scenes. The story lines and scenes could use more work. It's certainly worth a few rainy afternoons of play.
2,Worthless,I finished this game within a day. Only three major locations. Difficult moves needed. Only three major locations that I can remember. A waste of my good money!
2,National Lampoon's Half Life,"Gunman is a..clone of half life. The graphics and sound are dated, it's short, buggy and.., the AI is good but it uses half life's AI. It should be called National Lampoon's half life or Carry on half life."
2,"Half Life, in another form - but not as good!","When this game was first introduced by ReWolf Software, I admit I was excited about the possibilities this game possessed. When Valve took over the project, I pretty much lost any interest in the game. I was really hoping that the game would actually be in the Half Life universe, rather than only using the antiquated graphics engine. Sadly, I was incorrect. The unfortunate part of the game is...well, the game. Turok was bad enough on the N64. Why would I want to play it on the PC? If the game was still offered as a free download like several other Half Life modifications (Team Fortress Classic, Front Line Force, etc.), I would have given the game a higher rating. Otherwise, the game is not worth the $30. And that is my two cents."
3,A great book becomes a shadow of its former self,"After spending hours with my nose deep into the pages of Mr.Langworth's original hardcover Complete Book of Collectible Cars, I decided to purchase the update in paperback form. I must say that I would be much happier with the original.Gone are the color pictures of the world's great classics. Missing, as well, are the two and three paragraph summaries of each auto. Furthermore, many of the important classics, milestones and special-interest autos such as Cisitalia and Lancia Stratos have been cut.This book may still be the best overview of collector cars available. The author's comments about each model's pros and cons tend to be quite accurate.But I beg and plead for the publisher to bring back the hardcover edition!"
4,Very efficient,"I purchased this pancake dispenser for our church pancake events. I tried it out and found that it holds a lot of batter which is a plus! I was able to adjust the size of the pancakes fairly easily. My husband had to figure out how to disassemble and reassemble, once he figured it out it is pretty easy but would have been better if it would have come with instructions. It stands on it's own pretty well on a plate - I think the dispenser stand was/is not necessary."
4,PHOENIX FORCE IN CHINA,"Another fairly good read from GOLD EAGLE involving the Phoenix Force, written by William Fieldhouse, an excellent author.Book sees the return of John Trent, has much hand-to-hand combat, and very good descriptive sections on China. Possibly author has been there? Seems so.Though the book is reminiscent of #33 Ninja Blood, a prior Phoenix Force book also written by Mr. Fieldhouse, it is still worth the read.Semper Fi."
2,"Great Price, for and underwater mp3,","well i bought this one knowing it was cheap, i guess i just wanted to try for a couple of bucks if i could avoid spending 150 dollars on the speedo mp3.... bad choise it turns out to be a very cheap 128 mega mp3 that goes inside a pretty big and not so nice looking plastic bubble thats almost the size of a big red bull can (energizer drink) and its pretty hard to swim with it..... and worst of all, the mp3 player did not work, so i use it now as a pretty limited usb drive(memory stick) red colored and expensive, knowing that the 1 giga usb stick goes around 14.99 (kingstone) so i got a 40 something dollar mp3 player that dosent work good and looks bad, so save yourself a couple of bucks.... the one thing its pretty good are the waterproof earbuds, but i can use the with out and mp3 of course.thank you for your time."
4,Decent,"I bought this over a year ago (cost me $75!) and I loved it while it lasted. The plastic bubble may not be slick or pretty, but the player is not at all cumbersome while swimming; the sound is quite good and the batteries last a long time. The player functions suddenly stopped about a month ago, but for the price now, I would definitely get another one. I am not upset that it stopped working, actually I put it through a LOT because I was using it heavily for memory as well as playing music outside the water all this time. If anything I am surprised at its sturdiness."
2,Unfriendly to Mac,The mini cd doesn't fit into cd drive so I couldn't test loading the drivers. I got it to work exactly once with my MacIntosh and iTunes converted to mp3 files. After that...nothing... Very disappointed.
2,Not so great,"Had this for 2 years. Was working fine at the beginning, but very difficult to turn on and off and to change songs. The wire is cheap and broke after a couple of months. Then water entered and that was the end of it. This player was bigger than expected too. I won't recommend it."
5,Great Player for the Pool,"I've used this product now for a few weeks and I am really pleased. I have some arthritis problems and lap swimming is the only way I can exercise. I needed something to relieve the boredom and I found it. The sound is perfect and the unit is watertight and rugged. I am very happy with this product and I have already recommended it to other swimmers. The directions are worthless, but all you do is plug the unit into the USB drive and drop your songs or podcasts into the drive. It takes a single AAA battery which I have changed only once since I started using the device."
5,Archie Lives on in his Book,I met Archie in the 50s. He'd come by our high school every year during track and cross country season with his little black book and enough enthusiasm for life and athletics for all of us. Pretty sure Archie is gone now but his book is still here. Buy it and let him live again through the pages of his little black book.
3,Good price but didnt get item on date promised,"Fein blades are expensive. I bought a bunch from local woodcraft retailer and decided to check online with amazon. Was good price but package didnt arrive on date promised. Luckily it was in time for Christmas since it was a gift, would purchase from seller again but need to improve on ship date arrival that was promised."
5,Women's modern midrash on the book of Ruth,"I have always found the book of Ruth interesting, and had read all the midrash (stories, commentaries, thoughts, lessons, etc.) written on it. All the traditional midrash, however, were written by men, and are hundreds of year old. This book was a refreshing change: Stories, poems, essays, and thoughts on the biblical book of Ruth all written recently by women. We read this book in my Jewish Women's Book Discussion Group, and it was the only book whose discussion had to be continued for a second session."
2,Same As King Biscuit Show.,"Check the setlist. The Live EMI series releases that I have heard are the King Biscuit shows, in a budget version. This one lacks the typical KBFH liner notes and also does not include the interview. Sound quality isn't the greatest , the performance isn't the best either.Recommend Highway Song Live."
5,great price,what a great CD hard to find and the price and quality was great and was shipped right on time
5,"A ""Legendary"" Recording","This is one of those wonderful albums it is tough to tire of. Released in 1980, THE PAINTER brought a new type of respect to Christian music, with its mixing of classical and classic folk styles and insightful lyrics. Terry and John Talbot, formerly of Mason Proffit fame showcase songwriting and guitar playing like never before and seldom since. The followup, NO LONGER STRANGERS, released a few years later, also is an excellent record, but being difficult to measure up to this masterpiece, it was a little disappointing. However, both recordings, as well as the brothers' REBORN (1974), are incredibly important contributions to the Jesus Music Movement, and all three hold up today as classics. Fortunately, the Talbot Brothers are working together again."
4,poor silverstein cd,I like Silverstein CDs but this one just wansn't very good. unless you love Silverstein don't waste your time buying this CD. You are not missing anything.
3,A fair-to-middlin' movie for the kids...,"--...but quite slowly paced and most assuredly outdated.It's so politically incorrect, for example, that it shows adolescent and preadolescent boys - without adult supervision - confidently and effectively handling the sorts of small-caliber rifles that rural Americans learn to use at about the same age. And it accepts this as a matter of common sense, as if anyone who supposed otherwise was some sort of drooling idiot.If you have a kid in the household who had enjoyed Disney's film version of *Swiss Family Robinson* (1960), this low-budget, thoroughly unpolished production is a potential value.--"
1,Terrible movie...with an even worse print,"Between silly dialog, a predictable plot and a poor image quality (don't let the pretty picture on the cover fool you - the print looks like old VHS), this looks like someone's back yard school film project.When I saw it was based on a Jules Verne story, I was intrigued enough to pick this up. While I expected a cross between ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Shipwrecked"", what I got was a mess of a story with preposterous plot elements. Worse, there was very little ""action and adventure"" in favor of a stagnant story that felt padded and lacking in any logic.Avoid this one."
2,best to leave LOST ISLAND lost,Good movie for the under 10 group. Looks almost like a student project. Acting poor.
1,Should have stayed lost ...,"Sort of like a cross between ""Gilligan's Island"" (without the humor) and ""Lost"" (without the suspense) ... maybe well intended but the end results will in no way satisfy. I doubt that anyone actually sets out to make a bad movie but in this case if that was their goal they have been successful. If it's on cable and you're bored you might want to see if you can sit through the entire movie but I sure wouldn't spend good money to purchase or even rent it."
1,Don't bother!,"With respect to the reader from Chicago, this book will give the wrong information on scorpion species, care and identification. There are no acknowledgments in the book which obviously was not reviewed by experts in scorpion biology. It does have some good photographs, though most of the species illustrated are misidentified. Ms. Webb is known as a tarantula keeper, and probably a good one at that; scorpions she does not know well and apparently did not research the literature when preparing this book.I was among the reviewers of the book for the above mentioned American Tarantula Society. I recommend reading those reviews for the problems with this book. Further, I am an arachnid biologist who was among several scorpion biologists who reviewed the manuscript for Manny Rubio's book, also mentioned above and available here at Amazon.com. (Read the reviews at the Manny Rubio/Amzaon.com section.)"
2,If you're new to keeping scorpions - keep away from this book!,"I probably have every book ever written on scorpions and can state without any hesitation that this book offers nothing to anyone looking to keep their scorpions alive and thriving in captivity. The ONLY legitimate reason to ever buy this book is for the fine photographs (many of the scorpions in the photos are actually misidentified) that accompany the mostly useless, and to some groups of scorpions, dangerous text.If you're a novice level keeper or you're looking to acquire your first scorpion then, pick-up a copy of Manny Rubio's ""Scorpions: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual""."
2,"Buy the movie, pass on the book","I enjoy the movie, but since the book follows 95% of the movie dialog I found the book a let down. A couple things it did clear up from garbled movie dialog and Mike's previous involvement with Petra, but not worth the purchase. Apparent error on p.182-183, a nit really, author confuses Jacks-full (JJJ-66) with Jacks-up (JJ-66)."
5,Woderful compact laptop bag,"I recently had to switched from a desktop pc to a laptop and I recieved big black bulky bag to carry it to and from work everyday. I commute to work via bus and walk 7 blocks from my stop to my office twice a day. The bag given was way to bulky for sitting on the bus and heavy for walking. So I started looking for bags and the Sumdex She rules line caught my eye. 1st its so compact and light weight. I knew when I ordered it it should be small but when I got it I was pleasently shocked. Its so perfect in size and weight and carries exactly what I need. Another plus, its water proof!! Perfect for walking on rainy days. Im so happy with this bag!!"
3,Mysteries Remain,"The outstanding thing about this book is the author's personal research. His personal opinions are mostly what fills the book; this is not bad (it's his book), you should just know this ahead of time. I would have liked more particulars about the Hopewell culture (especially material culture) but that's not what the book is about. As far as measurements and astronomy go this book is exactly what it claims to be."
5,Liquid Glass LG100 Auto/Polish car,"Read the reviews and had to try for myself on my new car. Works GREAT! Easy on, Easy off. Great protection, water just beads off. Can apply in hot sun, easy buff off to hi-quality shine. So easy, you don't mind applying again later for added protection(2nd coat). When dirty, rinse car with waterhose(if water doesn't bead up, time to apply Liquid Glass again, usually last more than 2months) and dry off with microfiber clothes."
5,Liquid Glass Car Wax,"This is the best wax you will ever buy for your car, boat, airplane, etc. It cleans off tar and bugs as it waxes. It goes on easy and comes off just as easy. Been using for many years and I love it. This is the cheapest place to buy this polish. Fast shipping too."
5,Liquid Glass Wax,I have been using the product for years and always works great. Easy on and easy off. Gives that like new shine!!!
4,works wonders,"the more coats you put on the better,i have a bmw 740,orient blue painti put 4 coats on,waiting a week in between coats,the shine is unreal,especially at nite with the street lights bouncing off it,it lasts about 5 months,then you do it again,its work,but if you love your car and want the paint to last and look good,you must invest the time,if not then go down to autozone and buy some crap that will last until the next rain storm.i even use this stuff on my interior wood trim,great shine and protection too.just be careful not to get it everywhere,the white haze is a bitch,and especially on the outside rubber trim,and the vents on the top part of hood,but like i said you need to invest the time,and patience,if not then like i said,go buy some of that ICE by turtle wax,and it will last about 7 hours"
5,liquid Glass,This is the only polish that my husband will use on our cars. It keeps them looking great and like new.
4,works but not what i expected,i am using this in 40-50 degree weather so I think it's too cold to use this product so i only gave it a 4/5. i am assuming once it gets warm i will have a better experience.
5,better than wax,"I love this product. It produces a great shine, water beads up on it in fine beads, then rolls off. Very easy to apply and buff off i direct sunlight."
4,"Easy to apply, seems a good bug barrier","Put a few coats on two of my motorcycles. The shine is nice, but similar to other good products that are cheaper. I can't speak for the durability yet; I need some more road time to determine if it is as good as others say. So far, I like the ease of application. Much easier to apply and buff than other waxes and polishes, and you can do it in the sun. This alone is worth the cost differential. It does seem to repel bug guts more than other products...after an few hours of riding, it seemed my windshield was cleaner than my riding mates, and what bug squoosh was present was easy to remove. If durability is what others claim, it moves up to 5 stars..."
5,Love Bug Protection,"I have used this for years. In parts of Florida and the SouthEast, we have what we call ""love bugs."" Nasty little things with acid bodies that will etch the paint down to bare metal if you don't remove them.Liquid Glass is the only product I found that protects the paint against these little devils. All the other points about quality of finish, etc., are true, but this protection is amazing."
4,Metal - late-80s style,"I wasn't a big Great White fan, but I did enjoy a few cuts from them in the late-80s that are included in this collection.Hearing tunes such as ""House of Broken Love,"" ""Once Bitten, Twice Shy"" and ""The Angel Song"" puts a smile on my face only because it brings me back to a more carefree time in my life (despite the fact that the 80s, quite frankly, sucked).Great White was a good band who wrote good, original material and created great head-bangin' music - 80s style. - Donna Di Giacomo"
4,I like it a lot,The writers really keep the spirit of the TV series. I also like how Kolchak has to grudgingly adapt to technological progress but never gets caught up in it. He's still the same character McGavin gave us.
1,No black ink!!??,"This printer has one cartridge; not a black one, but a color one. If you want to print black, it squirts all 3 colors. Spend a few bucks more upfront to save from getting ripped off month-after-month in ink.According to my web searches, the cartridge has a total of 21 mL (milliliters) of cyan, magenta, and yellow ink. If your printer doesn't have a separate black cartridge, this will be equivalent to a 7 mL black cartridge, since it squirts all three colors at once. For an example, the HP #56 has 19 mL of black for around $20. By the time you buy 3 Lexmark cartridges for a total of $60, you could have saved almost $40 by owning a more expensive HP, assuming they squirt proportionally.Don't get me wrong, if you print 10 pages per month, it might be ok, but if you print any small volume, you will be gouged."
1,Don't buy this printer,"The poor dear gets flustered whenever I ask it to do something complicated, like print more than one page. It also sometimes forgets that it should print the whole page, not just the top half. It has no problem rapidly consuming ink, though.Will it make it to graduation day? Doubtful. (See ""Office Space."")"
3,Applicable injet print practise.,"a good ink concept for easy print on documents, especially. However it did not go into my windows vista operating system, not yet anyway. It was not listed on my plug n' play for vista. It did go into my windows XP, with the install disc relatively problem free. Nice price too."
1,Going back to the bookstore for my refund,"I suppose if you have a Ph.D, you are expected to write at least one text book to add to your portfolio and make a few bucks on the side - that kind of mentality was painfully prevalent when the author wrote this book. Dry text and sparse examples litter the text. The book title is misleading - it calls itself a 'developer's guide to visual lisp' when in fact, 36 pages (less than 10% of the book) is dedicated to that topic. Almost 200 pages of the book goes over the main AutoLisp functions - but hey, I've got an AutoCAD 14 book that explains that topic better. The book describes the author as a 'best selling author of a number of AutoCAD books'. If thats true, those books never made it to the North American market - now I know why. And finally, WHERE'S THE CD? No CD ever came with my copy of the book - maybe because I purchased an earlier printing. All in all, a major disappointment."
5,The cure for the common stratocaster.,"I bought this pickup to upgrade my MIM Fender Strat. Seymour Duncan always produces the highest quality pickups and this one is no exception. It screams, it made the guitar sound 200% better. Great for rhythm or lead, clean or distorted, this pickup rocks! Pretty quiet for a single coil pickup too. Best improvement you can make to a strat dollar for dollar."
4,A punchy and hot pick-up,"I've had an SSL-4 in the bridge position of my Strat for more than a quarter-century. This old model is a little noisy compared to better-shielded contemporary single-coil pick-ups, but you can't beat 27 years of aging that mellows the Alnico V magnets, so the tone on this is mellow and rich, yet with punchy responsiveness and very hot output. When tapped, it gets the glassy traditional Strat sound. I've really loved having one, but I'm actually going to swap mine out for something less noisy but equally hot 'n' nasty, like a new SHR-1."
1,Fanfare for the Volunteer,"Wow, I just got done listening to this piece on the radio, and it drove me nuts! It was insipid, trite, and it almost seemed like the composition of someone imitating Irish music. I said, ""This has to be the composition of an amateur."" Then I said, ""Whoever it is writes self-agrandizing music."" Then it hit me--this is the composition of the musician himself! That would explain all three things! I thought, ""When is this guy going to end this piece already?"" Over and over again, it went from fast to slow to fast to slow to fast to slow, and repeated themes in toto over and over again. I thought, is this the soundtrack for ""Lord of the Dance?""Don't buy this album!"
5,An Outstanding Book,"Mr. Wright shows us not only that he can create many blistering and mouthwatering recipes, but that he has also done the research to perfect them. While some recipes are so hot one needs to build up to them, each recipe is so tasty and delicious you don't really mind the sniffling nose and tearing eyes! Mr. Wright clearly knows much about the many different cuisines he explores. This book is a joy to read and its amazing recipes never cease to impress."
5,"To begin with, this game is EXCELLENT first person adventure",This PC-CDROM Game gives you a great tutorial level then takes you into the game itself which is excellent from a to z. Great movement withjoystick and controls. Nice graphics. Very realistic. I liked this one alot.
2,Do not buy this game.,"This game was programmed by Valve and published by Sierra. It has allowed and continues to allow players to cheat, see through walls, autoaim, and do other things they should never be able to do while playing multiplayer. Neither of these companies will take responsibility and it has been years since these cheats were discovered. Just know that if you buy this game you're supporting a couple of irresponsible companies. My two cents. You've been warned."
2,Is'nt this just Generations with CS?,"I brought HL:Generations the day it came out - I love it. I have also been playing CS (an included Modification) for about 2 years. This seems like a good product if you are starting out from scratch. But I would really recommend just buying Generations and getting CS of some kind of cover disk. By the time you buy this game - you'll have to patch it anyway. The biggist dissappointment is that it does NOT include the 3ed installment to the story, Blue Shift - This sees you playing as one of the Police officers named ""Barnny""."
5,Half-Life,"Half-Life is one of the best games ever made. Its rather outdated, but is still very challenging and incredibly fun. I found the story to be very addicting. The game play is a combo of action and puzzles, so it is at times exhilarating and at other irritating, but it always keeps you on your toes. Any and every sequel and expansion is worth trying after playing the first."
5,Simply the best,"No game out there has lived up to the hype of Half-Life. Some have tried mainly RTCW,MOHAA, and others in that catogory. To slam the graphics is a decent way to show how stupid you are, Half Life was created in 1999, three years ago, of course you would expect the graphics to be outdated but what you must look at is, the fact that after three years people are still willing and eager to pay $50 dollars. It just doesn't set standards for FPS but all computer games, no, all games in general. This Platinum edition is well worth the money if you don't have Half Life originally. For those who complain that it is too gory (I've bee seeng a lot of those complaints about games lately), well, you must realize that what you are seeing are thousands of red pixels and if you cannot stomach that you must return to the childrens section when you plan to buy a game."
1,Not Worth Buying,"HL is an awesome game with many modifications out there. The CDis not worth the price they charge. Counter-strike, Team Fortress, and Opposing Forces all come with the HL game of the year edition CD. Well, TFC and OPF at least hehe. CS is free to d/l off the web any way. The game is great, go buy hl:goty and d/l the updates so u can play tfc, opf, cs, dod, or whatever you like for free off the internet lol. If you're dumb you'd buy this to tell you the truth"
2,"In the right direction, but ...","This game adds the supply dimension into the RTS equation. All military units consume food every month, and all units fielded in the battlefield will gradually wear off, and have to rest in camps. This makes the game so much more strategical (as opposed to tactical), as players have to balance a big army and financial feasibility.However, the game is so TEDIOUS !! The game does not start with a fast scout unit with good line of sight, and the fog of war is not designed well. So a player has to spend a lot of time scouting. Before a battle, a player has to build a supply wagon, and assign villagers to stock it up with food. And it takes FOREVER !!So, with so much meaningless micro-management required, there is little time to think about strategy. And without strategy, this game is definitely inferior to some of the better titles on the market."
3,Meh,"It's a really old game, so I didn't expect much anyway, especially compared to other RTS games that have been released since then. I got it mainly for the story line but since it's so old, the video doesn't even properly work on my computer."
4,fate of the dragon top review,i think this game is alot of fun. it gets a little redundent after you get used to how to build your city. though if you like building citys and taking over other towns then this is a good game. i like age of empires and age of mythology so this game was a easy fit into that gender. overall i had a good time playing and would say if you like the other games like this one then you will enjoy yourself.
1,I hate this game,"I don't know why so many other people love this game. Personally, I have also played many other RTS like them. I always love the ""Three Kingdom"" period in China -- which is what 'Fate of Dragon' about. Thus, I bought 'Fate of Dragon' the moment I saw it in a store. However, I am very much disappointed. The game comes no where close to StarCraft, Age of King, Red Alert 2 or Emperor: Battle for Dune. It is the WOREST computer game I have ever own (on the other hand, I have only 10 pc games). The game surely offer many tons of upgrade, but you pretty mcuh upgrade all of them anyway. Since there are so many upgades, I can't keep track of them (must be 50+ of upgrade). Please don't buy it. It is a horrible game in my opinion. Nevertheless, the game graphic likes pretty good."
3,This game is ok,"Compared to all the other stradegy games I jown this is the worst of them all, but that doesnt mean its bad. I fit was the only game i owned, i would play it. It doesnt even require that much stradegy. There is one impossible part, and i mean impossible, when you play as cao cao, you get to around to something like the 5th mission, and you start off having to take over a castle, but they just dont give you enough men to to such a thing, (...) my brother beat the game as Liu bei. he liked the game, but not as much as the other names we have for PC stradegy."
5,What an AMAZING BOOK! Highly recommended.,"An enormous list of seed sources for 40,000 or so flowers, shrubs, trees, grasses, vegetables, and other plants in the seed trade. The book has a separate chapter on vegetables. It includes everything from Amaranth and Artichokes to Watermelon and Wheat, and everything in between. For each, author Platt offers a typically long list of varieties and one to several seed souces. For example, the book includes 53 different dent and flour corns, about 180 different cucumbers, and even 28 different radicchios. Who knew? Other vegetables receive equally detailed treatment. Many US gardeners will hope for more stateside suppliers, but Platt notes which of the many European companies are set up to handle exports."
4,Power Rasp Trials,"Works very well on tile thin-set, and other soft materialsBut no match for concrete surfaces, carbide particles grind down to nothing fast."
4,MP FEIN REVIEW,The power rasp is excelent at removing paint as well as thinset under tile that has been removed
2,Not great,"This rasp is OK only. It is well-coated with abrasive and that abrasive seems to be uniform (maybe 40 grit) and durable. Unfortunately, the base metal is thin aluminum that bends with the slightest pressure. Had Fein made this rasp out of steel, this would be a 5-star product. However, considering the price and the fact that the rasp is so delicate, I'd call it a fake product. Fein could have done better."
1,Poor Product,"Unlike standard package, tissues are hard to pull out of package, the package leaks and must be kept in a Ziploc bag and they tear very easily."
5,Travel Size is Great!,"I have these in my desk at work. I have one in my baby's diaper bag, and my wife keeps one in her purse. They are exactly the same as the big pack. The little package is adhesive resealable. There are only ten in a pack, but again, I tear each tissue in half to help cut down on waste. The tissues are like eight by eight, so they're plenty big. The packaging is a common plastic package, and when I put it in my back pocket to head over to the restroom, I can hear it crinkling in my pocket. You definitely couldn't carry these around with you in public without everyone knowing you have a pack of wipes in your pocket. Oh well. Overall, they are great! Five stars!"
2,Too much too fast,"I had this book for a linear algebra class and it covered very few details. The book doesn't explain very much. There are lots of examples but the examples are not explained very well. Since there are three subjects taught in this book everything seems to be compacted to fit into the one book. If your looking for a book to teach a class, use one that focuses more on the subject matter and not on the field as a whole."
1,"Fun Concept, badly done.","I LOVE Mexican Movies with a twist of humor and everyday life. Yet, this film begs for quality story plots with a much more sophisticated touch of editing. I found this storyline vulgar, tasteless, and inappropriate for well-educated viewers. In other words, if a person was raised in a whore house, this film will fit his style perfectly. This MEXICAN film, although well-intended, is certainly NOT for me! Not for quality film seekers. Try: Tired of Kissing Frogs, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mama Tambien, El Estudiante, Rata de Dos Patas, 7 Dias, Ladron que roba a ladron, etc. Now, THESE movies deserve positive acknowledgement!!!!"
4,Birdy the Mighty: Final Forcer Review,This is one of the best anime movies I have ever seen. It is about this boy (Tsutomu) who is almost killed by Birdy. The only way to save this boy is for Birdy to merge with Tsutomu. So pretty much the story is about this boy who wants to have a normal life but has a Girl in his head that frequently talks to him. Yet they can switch the control of the body and it will then turn into the physical body of the mind that is controlling it. It was a really weird idea for the director but it sure made a really good movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet I recommend seeing it. The anime is really high in quality and the plot is good also. See this movie if you want to watch something different!
5,Really good,"I have this cd, it is really good, he was very anointed, and the songs make you think also. I would recommend it to anyone else"
2,Pictures?????,"where are the pictures of the finished dishes?????????there were like 3 pictures total....????!!!!!???????for nearly 30 bucks, i expected more....very disappointed......"
3,Trial by fire,"I'm giving it a mediocre review for things like the Fm transmitter. Didn't work well, nearly impossible to hear when driving no matter how much I turned up the volume. That's what I bought it for, but I also used the sport case. I use my iPod every day while I do ranch work. I put the iPod in my pocket and the case provided great protection.I had a small grass fire early this summer and had my ipod and with me. While trying to put out the fire I dropped my iPod and figured it would be a total loss once things settled down. Well, my headphones had melted to nothing but my iPod only had some minor damage around the bottom where the case was open to plug in the cables. The case was damaged, but it had protected my iPod. So all in all it was well worth the money."
5,Great music for little people,"This is a fabulous compilation of songs in many languages from all over the world. My favorite is ""on a vacation"" ... I'm learning new languages and words right along with my toddler! Highly recommended ... along with anything from MFLP!"
3,Recommended! Good Language Exposure. Fun. Not Commercial.,"My children have listened to this CD for two months now, and we recommend it. We rank this much higher than most of the commercial children's music on the market, like Disney and various pop music CD's for kids.This collection has some outstanding songs your children will love that you would have a hard time finding otherwise, like ""The Unicorn"" and ""On a Vacation,"" which is very funny. You even get the wonderful ""Like Me and You"" by Raffi.This CD is not perfect. Some of the songs are not good. The recurring ""Sweet Honey on a Rock"" is extremely annoying.But the rest of the good songs make up for it. Get it for the language exposure and the handful of excellent songs.I also highly recommend any CD's by Raffi if you are looking for the highest quality and most fun children's music. Raffi is the best of all."
3,Some fun songs and some really irritating ones,"I bought this mainly because of the songs that teach counting in other languages. It is so irritating to listen to! ""Sweet Honey In the Rock"" does a buzzing sound like a chain saw in teh background as they speak through numbers 1-12. It's a shame because some of the other songs are fun to listen to like ""On a Vacation"" by the Chenielle Sisters which introduces silly sentences and their translations. Some of teh songs don't introduce foreign language but instead offer the sound of music from another country like ""The Unicorn"" by The Irish Rovers. I'd probably keep the CD if it weren't for the irritating ""Sweet Honey In the Rock"" songs that consist of 4 of the 18 songs. I'm re-selling it though."
2,Thin.,"I was very disappointed by the content of this book. Especially since I had gotten a lot of use out of the Wow!Photoshop book. Very little linear direction and a less than intuitive cd make this book a reference for ideas or tips but certainly not a tutorial. And now that I have learned Illustrator I can't imagine why I would need it. Also, the fall back line used liberally throughout ""this is covered in the Illustrator manual"" was like a teacher reminding you that you should have done your homework. P-U!"
4,The second time around...,"This was my second read of A Chance on Love. I found the characters and plot interesting and compelling. However, as on the first read, I was unable stay in the present-day time period. I had to keep forcing myself to stop visualizing an earlier time period and keep them in modern day view. Otherwise, I think it was ""worth the send time around"".Ms. Snoe's view of the culture and beauty of the Florida Keys was interesting and vivid. Love flairs to conquer even Cay's belief that he was doomed by the inevitable curse by an ""obeah"" on the males of the Ellis clan and Sasha's legal entanglement to hold onto her inherited land."
2,Couldn't get into this one,"I couldn't get into this one, it was kinda of confusing with all the stuff about the obeah, the only scenes I liked was the ones between Sherry and Jason."
2,Can't get past the after taste,"The consistency is wonderful; the convenience is great, but I really don't like the aftertaste of this product. It could just be a personal preference. I'm reminded of green olives for some odd reason."
4,Does not work in regular light sockets,"I honestly didn't ever get to try out this light, because it does not work in regular (incandescent) light sockets. It would be majorly helpful if the listing was updated to reflect that fact! I tried to find a fixture for it locally and most HPS fixtures are only rated up to 75W."
2,Not as expected,"This wrap bracelet was not as expected. It is unique, kind of pretty and sytlish but i did not like the quality once it was received and I would not wear it.."
3,Poor packing,"Really poor packing. 2 of the cans were so badly dented they were leaking and had to be thrown away. I noticed other people had complained in their reviews of similar problems.As far as the product goes, dogs like it ok, but there are only 2 small wings per package and the rest is gravy and cubes of other stuff?? Probably won't reorder."
4,one of my dogs favorites,very reasonable price and free shipping to home...what's not to love? whole wings (not thrilled about the bones but they are soft enough to break with your fingers...or remove if you want) included
5,NICE CHANGE OF PACE.,WE USE THIS FOOD AS A CHANGE OF PACE FOR THE DOGS. THEY LOVE IT AND ARE ALWAYS HAPPY TO GET IT. EVEN OUR CAT LIKES TO SNEEK A BITE WHEN THE DOGS AREN'T LOOKING! REALLY WHOLESOME LOOKING FOOD. WE WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOOD TO ALL PETS.
2,false advertising on cans,"I purchased two cases of Merricks Wingalings and Smothered Comfort. The label states ""whole thighs"" and ""whole wings"" but that is a lie. Once opened, the cans have one - if you're lucky two pieces. The rest (3/4 of each can) is processed cubes of who knows what my dog refuses to eat. Merricks should either fill the can with what they advertise - ""WHOLE thighs and wings"" - plural - or tell the consumer the truth about what they are selling here."
5,Not a review,What does Epipleptic mean? When i try and look it up I keep finding th edefinition for epileptic. I feel like i'm missing something obvious.
3,comforter not comfortable,the shipping cost as much as the blanket so that is the first downfall. it dosen't cost that much to send to canada but shipping is always so outrageous. i have a store and currently ship alot to the states and it doesn't cost as much as canadians are always charged. second the blanket is scratchy so i ended up buying $25 a meter(yard) to line it with. the blanket ended up costing $70 when it was all said and done. it is gorgeous now though.
5,Contemporary introduction,"What I like about Dr. May's books is that he takes his readers into contemporary discussions of Moral Theology, giving you a clear and succint overview of the discussion, the salient points of disagreement, as well as his own view of the matter. This introduction covers all the main areas of Moral Theology (conscience, natural law, freedom, sin...) but rather than just presenting the basics of these discussions in the traditional way as in many other introductions, Dr. May covers them with an eye toward the contemporary discussions. The other thing I like is Dr. May's weaving in the works of the Magisterium into his presentation. His chapter on Veritatis Splendor is excellent! This is a must read! I found it especially helpful (and refreshing) after reading a more standard/traditional introduction to Moral Theology."
5,An exhaustive explanation of repair and maintenance.,"This manual is an absolute essential for anyone who wants to work on an early ford bronco or 70's pick-up. It covers every topic from routine maintenance to engine and body repair. The content is based on a complete tear-down and rebuild of the truck. Although it is very technical subject matter, the wording is relatively simple where possible, and diagrams and photographs are very helpful. Information such as engine specifications and wiring diagrams are provided for individual year models where applicable. It does not discuss restoration explicitely, but the information it contains is as invaluable to the restorer as it is to the amatuer mechanic. In other words, this is truly THE book every early bronco owner should have on his shelf."
3,"Useful, but not best resource","As with most Haynes or Chilton manuals this book does give some useful information, step-by-step descriptions and nice diagrams. However it's sometimes a little vauge in it's descriptions. Also, as an early Bronco owner, this book only covers 1973 and later. This leaves 7 years of earlier production not covered.Definitely a good reference, but I would also recommend finding an original factory Ford shop manual set. (5 book set usually found at swap meets or specialty automotive literature vendors)"
2,Information to vague to be useful,"This is the first repair manual I bought to assist me in restoring my '76 Bronco. While it provides an adequate overview of the vehicles it tries to represent, it does not offer enough info to be useful to the more experienced do-it-yourselfer. Additionally, the coverage of pre-'78 trucks is insufficient for a manual that claims to be ""Based on a complete teardown and rebuild"". The only info that seems to stand out as being particularly useful are the chassis electrical schematics in the back. This manual is fine as a (very) basic reference to keep in the glovebox; however, if you're looking to do something more involved than doing a tuneup or brakes, look for a set of factory service manuals."
3,1978 ford bronco,"the book is ok, it's like any other hanyes or chilton book. just never enough information on subject's in the book"
3,Good looking mirrors,"Bought these to replace the same exact morrors I had on my 66 F250. The first set rusted the first Winter we had here in Colorado and so did these. I was expecting it to happen. They are very inexpensive mirrors but they give you a great big view. They get rusty very quick but it is just surface rust and it matches my old beat up pickup. If you are buying these for the first time, remember that they are big mirrors and will block cars from view if you arent careful. They are worth the cheap price. I only replaced them because someone broke my first set while it was parked in front of my house."
1,Don't buy this one!!,"Pete (see review above) is right--my scanner was fine, but stopped working about a month after the warranty expired. the power indicator NEVER went off, and I suspect that the power supply burnt out.Of course, you can get a ""refurbished"" unit for the price of a new one. Don't bother."
1,Patriot CF 1GB Locks up my Pocket PC,"I bought an iPaq hx2755 because it has slots for both an SD and a CF card. I found a good deal (I thought) on a 1GB CF Patriot card. I wasn't paying much attention to brands back then, but this card has caused me more grief than I can describe. I finally figured out that removing the card from the Pocket PC lets it break free and start acting normally. It seems there is some problem accessing the card, so the iPaq just sits there retrying ad-nauseum until finally, after 15 minutes or so, gives up, and the machine starts to settle down. It's easier for me just to remove the card so I can get to work. I won't be buying Patriot memory cards again any time soon."
3,Review,"The book was okay. It rambled in parts and become a little boring. Could have used a little more ""meat"" to the plot."
5,Western tale,"This is a very creative but depressing book, but with a great and happy ending. This book isn't your normal cinderalla story type book, but it is about a woman who is in the time of when men and women were looked at differently, and had totally different jobs. It was unheard of when a male did what a woman generally did or when a woman did what a man generally did. Samantha (main character) is hated by her father for not being the son he had always wanted. She turns out to be a really powerful woman despite the era of time that she is living in. Samantha gets a job as the town sheriff, and with the job comes great responsibility. While she is sheriff, she goes on many adventures while also learning that the father is a bad guy. Thankfully, Samantha finds a man who loves and respects her as the woman she is. This is a great book for anybody who likes old western books with a twist or a romance novel."
5,Review of Lonely is the Heart,"Lonely is the Heart by Kelli Crawford has a little bit for every reader. Our hero Sam is plagued by an abusive past, in a challenging career, and faced with difficult decisions about romance. In addition Sam is hunted by the bad guys and faces multiple threats on her very life. Between an abusive father, a rocky love life, and a difficult job, it would seem Sam's life could not get worse. The mix of romance, adventure, life trials, and danger makes Lonely is the Heart by Kellie Crawford a good read for everyone. Identifying the mastermind behind the death threats to Sam gives the story another twist that will horrify and thrill readers. Lonely is the Heart had this reader wondering what happens next and wishing to hear more about Sam's life and future adventures."
5,Exactly What I Needed! Great Deal!,"I ruined my dads blade, so I needed to replace it, and I am so glad I found this store, I got a great deal and without knowing anything about the device this goes to, I was able to find the correct blade easily."
5,Killer grout remover,"Yes, you have to have a Fein oscillating sander to use the blade. The sander has a lifetime warrantee and can be used for hours at a time without problem. The blade turns out to be way cheaper than the multiple Dremmel 1/16"" diamond grout-removal blades you can eat up on a large project (though I stll used one for small places). If you can swing it, the Fein sander is usually available for $290 somewhere-- plunge cuts, sands, rasps-- and is far safer than a rotary tool because of it's oscillatory motion (like a bone saw for cast-removal). It's not cheap, but is is the best tool I've found for this."
2,Doesn't suit all grout lines.,Not as robust as I first thought. Doesn't last that long and when applying pressure it tends to warp. Not for commercial application.
1,Not worth your money,It is a toy. Do not waste your money. The thing was history after removing one 8x8 tile. I wish Fein made a diamond blade.
1,USE WITH CAUTION,"I have a 512MB mini cruzer that was loaded with files. This technology sure is convenient until it decides to stop working. Be carefull. I have a classroom of 15 students and two of them have had these products fail. The reason I am leaving this review is that I just had mine fail. You will get an IO error and the drive can not be accessed. Sandisk support recommemdation? ........reformat the drive. Be sure to have back-ups of all your files because in my experience, these are not reliable products."
5,Great Portable Drive,I bought a 256mb San Disk mini a couple of months ago. I liked it so much I bought another one only this time a 512mb one too. They are great little devices at a GREAT price.... Love it...
5,Great,Great product. Works perfectly. One of my friends bought this EXACT same product for $49.99. I payed $17.49
1,Quit working after one day,"This product stopped working the day after I bought it. Sandisk customer service is poor. Sandisk return details are inconsistent with the Fedex email. Sandisk claims the product must be in Fedex hands by midnight the day the label prints, and the Fedex e-mail claims one has 5 days. Additionally, Sandisk does not provide details as to whether the label is Express or Ground. Fedex needs this information to determine a drop-off location. One cannot determine this without printing the label.Trying to return this defective Sandisk product is a nightmare due to the poor details Sandisk provides about the process."
2,poor tech support,"This product worked great for about two months. I took great care of it.Then, it quit working. I wrote to tech-support and exchanged details. Then, I sent it to them. Two months later, they sent it back to me, without having done any work on it. And they told me that I did not have an RMA #.I am in the Army Reserve in Iraq, taking fire daily for the US. I don't need this kind of hassle. I made this clear to them in all my correspondance. But it got me nowhere.I think I provided more than enough info in the letters that I sent them and the e-mails. AAAARRGH!!!!"
5,Great piece of Technology,"I have 1-256 meg and 2-512 meg drives and they are great. Fast, portable and convenient. Moving files between laptop and desktop is a breeze.<br />The downloadable program at SanDisk alows you to backup files on the mini and add to them only files that have changed. With all the viruses around this is very valuable<br />I highly recommend it!"
1,Don`t waste your money,"I bougth this item long time ago, and It just worked for 3 weeks...I contacted the custumers line and they can fixed it, no refound, no flash memory, and a small debt to pay."
3,"Good drive, but ...","with the prices on flash drives continuing to drop and capacities continuing to expand, this size drive is becoming obsolete. Nothing wrong with it, just outdated. SanDisk is a good brand and I've had no problems."
1,Crap,"I bought this piece of S at the Office Depot in N. Brunswick, NJ (sucks) back in Jan. '05. Niether my Dell Inspiron laptop nor ThinkPad were able to recognize the device without some ridiculous snafu (often, the device would be read as ""ADIR ROM,"" whatever the F that means; occassionaly, the device would work only after jamming it into the USB port several times). With flash drives, assured compatibility with all computer types is critical (think of work-related Powerpoints, JPEGs, speadsheets and documents). If a flash drive cannot be relied on 100% of the time, it's not worth owning. The 512 MB Cruzer Mini, at least the one I purchased, was erratic and completely unreliable. What a disappointment. I would have expected more from SanDisk."
1,Horrible,"This was the worst flash drive I have ever used. The one I got was found to be defective, as it never worked when I plugged it in my laptop or desktop. I contacted customer support where they paid for the shipping back via FedEx. In about a week I had a new drive, but surprise! That drive didn't work either. I called again and they supposedly put me on a list to be called back by the higher-up tech guys but I never got that call. I went and bought a Lexar instead. Of course, with my luck, it didn't work either. I returned it for the Memorex, which works perfectly."
3,Not for daily use,"It's the size of a pack of chewing gum and practically weightless... great for ocassional use. However, be warned about carrying it daily because these little things can not hold up to much wear and tear. It bends quite easily, and the shell is really thin plastic. With daily use, seems doomed to snap within the year.If you're looking for a drive to put on your keychain, this drive is not for you. Consider upgrading to the Cruzer Titanium if you want a rugged little drive... the metal case and no cap to lose are worth the extra price for the daily user. But if you don't need to travel with your drive daily, this drive is a very good deal for the price."
5,Wonderful,"My ScanDisk 512 MB Cruzer arrived quickly, and has been wonderful to use. Just what I was looking for!"
3,Works Sloooowwwwwwllyy,"Works as advertised, but is the slowest USB drive I have ever seen.If I transfer a single 10MB file to the drive, it might take about 5 - 6 seconds. But...If I transfer 1000 x 10K files to the unit, it might take about half an hour to complete. It seems to wait an eternity after transferring / moving a file, before it gets on to transferring another !!!This drive is now outdated - Only get it it is very cheap, and if you have plenty of time to spare.Other more modern USB drives are *much faster*."
3,"Very Convenient, But...",I've had some problems with data becoming corrupted in my 128MB version. Whether this is due to the components found within the flash drive or whether it's being exposed to a strong magnetic field or radiation from sun storms that're doing it is beyond me. But a device like this needs to be ultra reliable to be effective. Mine hasn't given me any problems lately.
4,Toshiba SD-P1700 player supports .srt files?,"Can anyone tell me about, if this Toshiba SD-P1700 player supports .srt, sub files."
4,Great picture quality,"I bought this item rather than the cheaper products advertised because I trust Toshiba and because the picture quality was better than average. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product. We have used it on several aiplane trips and my toddler is very entertained. We haven't had any problems with the mechanics of the player. We also bought a case (which I highly recommend) so that we have enough Baby Einstein to keep her happy to our destination. Also, the battery has never run out, and charges quickly. My only problem with it is that the volume doesn't go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner. But, my daughter mostly looks at the pictures anyway, so it wasn't that big a deal for us."
1,Don't buy this one,"I bought the Toshiba SD-P1700 portable DVD player as a birthday gift for my mom. This machine didn't work from the minute we turned it on. It would not read any of our DVDs. I either got the ""Invalid Disk"" message or if the machine did play the DVD, it would look seriously pixelated for a few seconds then would simply stop playing altogether. The DVDs, by the way, play just fine in my old Sony portable."
1,Never buying Toshiba again,"When I purchased this Toshiba portable DVD player (SD-P1700) a few years ago, there weren't enough reviews about it, but I trusted the name and bought it, and that was a big mistake. I only used it once when I was traveling, and it would always say ""Not Valid Disc"" or ""No Disc"" even when the disc has no problem at all, and only after many tries it would play. I tried to use it again for the second time in a long time, it wouldn't play at all. (with AC adaptor connected) So, I tried again after fully charging the battery and still won't play (either with or without the AC adaptor). It makes a very loud and uneven noise when it is trying to load the disc and never recognizes the disc or would play a few seconds and freeze up constantly. I would never trust Toshiba as long as it is made in China, because the problem could be due to poor craftmanship. (I've noticed with any electronics, specially batteries made in China never last.)"
2,Sent it right back,"I actually meant to order the Philips 7-incher (brighter screen, $20 cheaper, bulkier), but somehow I got confused when I placed the order...this one looked beautiful so I was pretty psyched anyway and was definitely going to keep it. I was planning on using this for work, as I get a lot of DVD's from clients - so I popped one of those in and guess what? It came up as ""invalid disc"". It's supposed to play the majority of formats, and I triple checked the disc in my other dvd players, and it worked in my Panasonic DVD/VHS combo player. A store-bought DVD worked fine (although I didn't play it much more than the first menu) so I know it's not broken.The first reviewer also noticed that it doesn't play a bunch of homemade DVD's, so I will confirm that here - if that's gonna be a deal-breaker for you then stay away. BTW, the DVD I was trying to play was made on a Philips burner. I didn't bother to test it with any others."
1,Buy anything other then this,Fell apart after 5 uses. Plastic fatigue at the back hinge. Very loud mechanical sounds at times at well. This was a product that felt like it was years old at time of purchase even tho it was brand new
1,SP-D1700 no better than SP-D1600,"So. I get this new fresh from the factory SP-D1700 and it works fine, with very light use, for about 7 or 8 months. Understand, when I say ""light use"", I mean maybe one DVD a month. Then, just like the SP-D1600 it just one day stops working. I continues to load disk and once and a while it will play one for about 20 seconds, then it quits. I've written a letter to Mark Simons, Vice President for digital products division. That was three weeks ago;so far I've been roundly ignored.October 7, 2007So here is my follow up after sending my second letter to Mr Simons on August 29,2007. Still no response. I have since however, read may complaints on various about being given the run around to just being ignored by toshiba(small""t"" from now on). These are signs of a company that is in trouble. I will chalk this up to experience and stay clear of anything made by toshiba in the future. THANK YOU MR. SIMONS."
5,I'm in Charge of Celebrations,One of the best picture books ever. I'm one who believes picture books are not just for children and this one proves it! It reflects a wonderful attitude that there's always something out there to celebrate. A most uplifting book. Byrd Baylor is really tuned into nature and Peter Parnell turns those words into unforgetable images.
4,Great Pinball Game,This is one of the most realistic pinball games that i have found out on the market. It is the only one that i've found that makes you feel like you're really playing a pinball machine. I can't stop playing it! The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is 1) because of the annoying announcers and music. They could have done a little better job on that. and 2) I wish there were more than just two different games. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good pinball game.
3,Not That Addictive,"It is just a shame that they don't make good pinball games to really score on the market like they absolutely used to. With Addiction Pinball, there is only 2 tables to really choose from. While the Worms Pinball seems not so addictive, the other one, World Rally Fever really takes the cake. Hopefully there are better pinball games out there that can really hit the jackpot."
5,It Covered Everything Except...,"how to avoid breaking my ankle--which I did! The guide, like all Lonely Planet publications I've used to date, is ecellent."
5,I Went Directly To Seller,"Pot arrived here without the 3 holes in the lid. I contacted the seller directly and they replaced the pot emidiately with a lid which has the three holes. Go and buy the ANOLON version of this pot, the UP handles are MUCH better than the R.Ray pot."
2,Pasta Pot?,"This is no 'pasta' pot as we know it, not compared to the one we have (Bialetti w/ locking lid). I highly suggest you do not purchase this pot if you think you won't need a colander to drain the water. My wife gave it one chance and had half of the pasta in the sink. She said there's just no way to get a good grip on the handles and hold the lid in place with only two hands. Even if you had a third you'll be there awhile because the draining spout and holes are minimal. It does appear to be a decently made pot however, but with the venting you can only do so much in it. You'll also need alot of cabinet room to store it because of it's odd shape (as compared to regular round pots.) Unless you have a very specific use for a pot that allows steam to escape, it's probably not worth the money. She hasn't tried it yet to make pasta to pour into a colander, but with those crazy raised handles it may prove to be awkward."
1,Returned,"I returned this product because it did not come with the steam holes in the lid as advertised. Don't know if it would have made a difference, but when the second pot came with the same (defect), I decided to return and get a refund."
4,What does Roarke really know about his past?,"This is the latest offering in the Death series by J.D. Robb. If this is your introduction to the series I really suggest that you go back and start at the beginning. There is not as much mystery in this one as some of the others.Much of this story revolves around Roarke¡s past as well as Dallas¡s dealing with their marriage when the tough gets going. There is quite a few sections that deal with what Roarke has thought was his parentage. I won¡t spoil it anymore.Also in this one Summerset and Gallahad have an encounter in the start that will leave Dallas with more to deal with that she had hoped for during the month. Not to mention that Peabody seems to be trying to make her eye twitch more than normal &#65533;In this story the murder is sending Nadine photos of the dead before they are found and telling her where to find them. Dallas along with Peabody, Feeney, McNab, Baxter and Trueheart take on this killer."
4,whats new,while this book was excellent and i definately would recommend it to others i gave it a 4 instead of a three for learning more and more about roarks past and my favorite scene was when eve took care of him.i missed the more spontaneous interaction with some of the characters and felt nadine wasnt given enough. i loved how crack has developed though.
5,Good read and keeps your interest.,JD does not disappoint in this mystery. It keeps you involved and evolves as only she can make it.I am a fan.
4,More for the character development than the mystery,"For me the mystery in this book wasn't as appealing and after a while it was just a distraction during a major milestone of Eve and Roark's married and personal lives. As always the surrounding cast is great.My only beef with the series is how slowly time passes between books. Eve or someone close to her dies or nearly dies every month for the last 2 years (of Her life). I don't care how great life with Roark is, this Cop has to suffer of post traumatic stress or something."
5,Hard to forget series.,"One day after this book was released I rushed to my family Wal-Mart just to buy this book talk about being hooked to this series, but anyway I'm glad I did this book is one of best of the whole series everyone of the major characters makes an entrance in their very special way. I felt for for Roarke when he finally meets a real connection to his family and cried for about his mother. Poor Summerset has an accident and has to rely on Spence and new very unique person, and our favorite Eve is trying to solve a very emotional case and try to give Roarke the emotional support that he needs. Yes, Nora works this story together in her very fantastic way. If you are looking for an exciting series read these books."
4,Photographing Light,"Portrait in Death by J.D. Robb is the 16th book in her series, In Death... . This mystery is centered in the world of portrait photography. Several young twenty-somethings are murdered and it is up to Lt. Eve Dallas and her team from the NYC police to solve the case. It's a unique and interesting mystery. I recommend this book to all (over 15 years old because of graphic sex and violence) who love mysteries. It will keep you guessing!"
4,Another Good One From J. D. Robb,"J. D. Robb has once again spun a fast-paced story using many of our favorite characters and dropping in a few that we don't see in every book. Eve Dallas' past has been critical to many of the In Death novels, this time Roarke's past has popped up again. This time it isn't his illegal past, but rather a part of his personal history that we see. While Eve is busy searching for another serial killer, this one striking innocent looking college students, Roarke is horrified to learn something new about his past. Something that causes problems within his marriage. Another sure winner and definite must read."
5,"great series, once more","This series had been getting dull in the last few outings, but it's back on track again. Thankfully for all the fans of Eve and Roarke Roberts is focusing on their relationship as well as crafting a fine police procedural. I appreciate all the futuristic touches that appear in this series, but let's face it the most compelling aspect is still the give and take between the main characters, so I'm really glad that Roberts is concentrating on Eve and Roarke rather than Peabody. If like me you were giving up on this series read this one and enjoy."
5,another gripping story,Once again JD Robb has a hit. I couldn't figure it out before the end of story. I havent read a bad in death book yet.
4,Eve Dallas fans will enjoy this book,"If you're a fan of the Eve Dallas series, you'll really enjoy this book. If you haven't kept up with the series, however, you will probably notice gaps in the story. The murder mystery was fascinating as always. And a surprise from Roarke's past and the path he took because of it were both interesting and moving. Very well written."
3,Not up to her usual standard,"I love the In Death series, I have them all and have read them dozens of times each. While I enjoyed the book, it didn't have some of the depth I have come to expect and some of the characters just weren't acting normal. Roarke does not fall apart when the people he loves get hurt. His reaction at the beginning of the book (even before finding out the new information on his background) didn't seem consistent with the Roarke we all know and love. The mystery itself was a bit pat and again seemed closer to a fan-fic rather than the pure excellence we all expect. It was a nice filler book, and the information will help build on the stories in the future. I wouldn't recommend reading this first if you have never read any of the series. Read any of the others first."
1,Why can't I get this via Kindle in the US?,Why can't I get Portrait in Death and Divided in Death via Kindle in the US? Does anyone have any tips on how I can manage to do this? Thanks!
3,Is the magic gone?,"The last 2 books of this series have been disappointing. I was looking forward to reading the interaction between Eve, Summerset and Roarke, but it did not deliver. In earlier books, the characters were written in such a vivid and impacting way; in this book, I found the charaters' interaction to be predictable and unengaging. The storyline did not hold my attention. I actually skipped ahead and did not read all of the murder story. I read the few pages for the next story - another murder with a mutiliated woman. Is anyone else getting tired of reading about this subject?"
1,unbearable,"All the elements in this book is overplayed. This is the first book I've seen in the series and it will be the last. The conversations made me want to gag. It got to a point where I couldn't read beyond a few more paragraphs, and indeed I only read up to page 62. The storyline was not very interesting either."
5,consistent quality,"I keep waiting for this series to do the inevitable slump, but nope, not yet :-) Portrait in Death is just as fantastic as the previous In Death novels from this author. Kept me guessing to the end. Fantastic characterisation. And I loved seeing more of Roarke, of course."
4,VERY CHARACTER DRIVEN,"I love how this series is character driven, but it is true that the series is steadily losing the substance that first drew me in.In this installment, I had difficulty coming to care about any of the characters, but inevitably I became a prisoner in the world of Eve Dallas. She's like an old friend that you just keep coming to visit. You might not like everything about her, but she's so real you just feel like you're a part of the story. It is not scene, structure or substance that takes you on the thrill ride in this story. It is the characters. At this point, you've come to know them. If you're still reading at this point in the series, you're reading about family members. Imaginary family members to be sure, but family nonetheless."
5,Outstanding Fun!,"Need I say more...This is a mentally challenging game that will keep you occupied for hours. Unlike many shoot-em-ups out there, the almost puzzle/chess like quality kept me coming back for more. Sure the interface is a bit cumbersome, but the gameplay seriously overrides this deficiency. Besides, thats what we're all looking for anyway right?: A game that plays well and is enjoyable. If you are ready for a tense thinking man's computer game, look no further."
4,Whew.....you've got to be kidding me,"This is a great game, but....... man you have got to learn the keyboard. Not just hot keys, also key combinations. You can pretty much get your people to do anything, but you've got to know how to do it. I am not a veteran of the previous versions and I am definitely paying for it. I normally play FPS games, i.e. quake III, and thought I would stimulate my brain a little better with a strategy type game. It was a good move, but after a couple hours I am exausted mentally. I am no genius but I am an engineer so I consider myself fairly intelligent, this is a hard but challenging game. I would recommend it, but have some patience. Try to learn as much as you can about the movements commonly used and you'll enjoy it."
5,"NEW REVIEW FROM THE WINNER OF ""REVIEW OF THE YEAR IN PC-G""","Commandos 2 is a great game! Never have i played a game with such realness, graphics and gameplay such as commados2 i also have the other edition this is also great, I strongly suggest before you play the game you see and play all the tutorials, I say this because many things you won't understand and it give you a better experiance of the whole game. DONT Cheat!! It ruins the whole game on one mission i cheated when i finished the mission I felt as if i had accopplished nil, when on other missions i fell g8!!!!...."
4,Whoops !,"I was used to play shoot-em-up games only, now I've changed my mind a bit. Funny and realistic. N1 is the green beret, N2 is the sniper.Just one thing: the saving and loading operations are too long..."
5,A huge improvement over the first,"Okay, I must admit that I started to take this game back once I first popped it in. I found the new controls and systems too difficult to understand right out of the box. I was an avid Commandos player and I thought for sure I could manage the next version. However, it took me several attempts at the training missions and numerous trips to the instruction manual to figure things out. But, now that I have everything down pat, I love this game. The new features that allow you to go inside of buildings, post people on guard, the new characters, the ability to rotate the view (a must use feature), and the upgraded graphics make this a great game. EIDOS really did things right by putting out a sequel to a great game that took what we liked about the first one and made it better!"
5,I GOT IT!!!!!!!!,"This is one HOT game. It's truly incredible! I'm not gonna waste any more time writing this review, I have some playing to do."
4,Damn thing is GOOD!,"I was one of the people who had been eagerly waiting for Commandos 2 and bought it with preorder.I've only played 2 tutorial and 2 mission until now and left 8 to go for an ending(9 if I include the secret mission).One thing most clear is that level is huge and those who liked original Commandos will certainly love this one, too.But there is problem with the interface. Though I cannot think better way for an interface, it is quite tricky sometimes and I have to consult a manual and in-game help a lot.Except that, this one is very addicting and has many interesting situations. Those who liked original should buy this one. Those who not probably wait till Demo is available though I'm not sure it will be available or not. (I'm not sure but I heard that Pyro guys had left their Studio. If this is true, I wonder who can make patches and demo.)"
3,could be a lot better,"installing the game is the most annoying thing because you have to switch cds four times. I got the game while I was on vacation because it was only 14.99, it is a very good game. I would recommend it to people who like long and difficult 3rd person action/strategy games. I hope the next one is better, a lot better , enjoy!"
3,"Good game, but very difficult in the beggining.","I bought this game after reading great reviews online and in magazines. But after playing and failing at the first two training levels that you have to beat in order to start a game, I put the game away in frustration. I bought this game for 40.00 dollars and i only got to play 1/16 of it."
1,Not qualified to write this book,"This woman owes myself and hundreds of people their paycheck from her business she withheld and did not pay!! Her company was a sham and Victoria's self serving narcissim continues.... she's no role model and definitely not a ""Spiritual leader"" but more along the lines of a phoney con artist. She's only not promoting that she is responsilbe for driving her $200M business into a CH-11 - and then with holding payrolls from her internal staff and temporary employees. She's unethical and dillusional to beleive she has the ""Spiritual"" or any other qualities to lead. She's driven two companies into the ground! Enron executive in the making!"
2,Reared By Jehovah's Witness Parents,"Victoria Lowe reportedly was reared by Jehovah's Witness Parents who owned and operated the largest minority owned/operated trucking firm in the midwest. Thus, readers should be careful as to whether Lowe's business shortcomings are attributable to her present christian faith, or to that of her formative environment."
2,A primer for XML support in Oracle,"There are several problems with this book. One is that very little coverage is given to the Oracle XML SDK. I could not find useful documentation on TechNet regarding use of the XML SDK via PL/SQL. I had hoped that this book would provide examples of SDK and a more complete set of documentation. To my disappointment, this book does not provide much more than an overview.The other problem with this book is that it was written with examples for Oracle Application Server, which has been replaced by iAS. Bottom line, this book reads like it was written for the first release of Oracle's XML SDK. Your better off on TechNet and the newsgroups."
2,Technet on paper,"If you've ever tried understanding Oracle's XML offering from the technet documentation, you've probably given up in despair, as the information is available, but it's totally disorganised.Unfortunately, this book suffers the same problems. Many of the examples can be found on technet, and the organisation is no better. Like many Oracle Press books, this layout is poor, and the examples are either superficial or non-existent.Instead, try Steve Muench's ""Oracle XML Applications."" It's superb."
2,Oracle XML Handbook,"I am not too happy about the contents of this book... The sample programs are also from Oracle website.This book is a collection of documents and papers from Oracle website, no need to buy this book. Not recommended!"
5,High quality watch with lowest price!!,"This is my second Omega watch the first being a 1968 Constellation. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Constellation Double eagle was available. My '68 Constellation is in perfect running order and has been a joy to own. It was passed down to me by my family. When I saw the affordable price from Amazon for the 2500 Co-Axial movement, I could not pass it up. This watch keeps perfect time just like the '68 and looks so much better in person than the picture. The champagne face is actually a classic gold color..very tasteful. This, along with the 1968 Constellation will be passed along for generations to come."
3,"Phonics, Phonemic Awareness, and Word Analysis for Teachers",Good reference for new teachers in early childhood education. Lesson samples and ideas are given. You will realize how complex the English language is. Even the structure of words are organized. They are not just simple alphabets and sight words.
4,Enjoyable.,"The team behind much of Ricky Martin's best latin recordings spin their magic for another heartthrob, to good effect. Excellent songwriting and production, ala Martin's ""Vuelve,"" and Alan's heartfelt vocals add up to a pleasantly satisfying pop CD."
5,"A must for every couple married,engaged or divorcing.",Dr. Wheat provides both biblical insight and practical application for couples who want the most out of their marriage. Each of the three books has it owns value. I have recommended the book to scores of people who have come to me for counseling and have given many copies to those on the verge of divorce.
4,Good Lust Almighty!,"Characters of Lust is a fast paced evolving read. Shelby Tate, the main character, is torn between what feels good and what is the right thing to do. She teaches us that no matter how hard we try, we falter, and that we must continue to strive to do better.LeBlanc has a cast of characters with their own individual styles and personalities. The book is vividly written and draws the reader into the pages. If you are looking for an engaging read that will leave you satisfied,then Characters of Lust is a must buy.Wanda D. HudsonWait For Love: A Black Girl's Story"
4,Temptation is a B....,"""Characters of Lust"" is a perfect name for Karlyn LeBlanc's debut novel. After the breakup of a long term relationship Shelby Tate steps up her faith in God and vows to be true to herself. But in this romantic, sexy novel, Shelby struggles between her Christianity and backsliding in the name of lust.This novel is funny, real and sexy.Emotions run high and the inspirational message is clear, leaving the reader totally satisfied.This is a story many of us can relate to.LocksieARC Book Club Inc."
5,Hot & Steamy,"This book is excellent, a must buy. If you like Zane you'll love ""Characters of Lust."" It grabs your attention from page one. I don't want to reveal too much about it, but it is certainly a book you can relate to. Take it from me I wrote it.."
4,Very Comfortable,"I purchased these the end of July & they are very comfortable, but a month later they are falling apart...one sandal has split across the middle. I have been in contact with the company and they said I just have to send them back and they will send me a new pair. I received a very quick response from the company. Great customer service & no issues with the new pair."
5,Excellent,Great author. This item was just as it was described in the posting and I was very happy with the quality. Thanks!
2,not emporium,"I purchased emporium some time ago and loved Adam's Short stories. They were well imagined and the action moved quickly. This novel, his first, is well written. Adam Johnson knows how to write. However, the story just sort of plods along like a basset hound without legs. The first hundred pages or so are deluded with foreshadow and the imaginative although totally unrealistic plot suffers. I read about 120 pages hoping I'd make it to some sort of action packed-adjective soaked-ground breaking sequence... but unfortunately it just never comes. Buy emporium!"
5,From the Dead Sea,This is the best lotion for dry skin. I bought home a suitcase full of this lotion from Israel.
5,It was a wonderful extra ordinary piece of literature,"I got to read this book while Keely played with my kitties, Mister Herb, Bert and Ernie. The book was as entertaining to me as the Kitties were to Keely."
5,Lots of Fun,This is one of my favorite series and this season is better because the writers have gone back to the off beat characters that we came to love in Season 1. Season 2 was a little darker and Jane seemed bitter and not as genuine as the character in Season 1. Season 3 was better and now with Season 4 the writers are continuing on with that character development. I like all of the main characters on the show and they all have their quirks that work well with each other. I would like to see an end to Red John; I actually like these type of shows to be reconciled within one or a couple of episodes.
3,"not the best video quality, specially the sound","First time I tried this service, I've seen most of all the seasons and I was missing that episode so I tried it since most ""free online tv are scams...""The video is blurry, it is very dark, I had to put my laptop screen on a weird angle to see better the image but what was more annoying was the sound. It's as if the was a constant ""skidding"" on the background, it sounded also very ""metallic.""For those out there, the key is not to miss an episode..."
5,Patrick Jane is wonderful,I never watched this tv show until it started on TNT - just like Castle - but I have finally gotten caught up on the 1st four seasons I missed and really love this tv show now. Simon Baker's character is awesome!
5,Always a good evening with The Mentalist!,"A very well made show, The characters are engaging, the acting is very good and the storylines are always enjoyable. All the actors are attractive and pleasurable to watch, yet seem believable in their given roles. Simon Baker is charming, and I love Van Pelt, Rigsby and Cho! Enjoy the romantic dynamics of each character and hope the writers keep up the good work."
5,Best Show,Best show ever created. It is such a realistic aproach of how an interview should occur. Jane's technique is unorthodox and proven to be very effective.
5,delightful and charming,"I look forward to watching this each week. When I travel I take my copies with me and watch them in the evenings in the motel room. It is hard to find good programs on TV, but this is at the top."
1,HUGE HEAD ACHE!,Absolutely aweful..... i had this product for years... took me forever to get it set up. linksys was no help... support was aweful...dont recommend their products at all.
1,Another crappy Linksys product,"Just doesn't work. After hours of work and no help from Linksys, this thing is sitting at the bottom of a box in my basement. Save your money."
1,Good Luck Configuring the Software,I should have believed everything I read. Each review said that it was difficult to impossible to configure. After 5 hours I gave up and its sitting in a closet. Dont waste your money.
3,JUST WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT,"I THINK THIS ONE IS MY LEAST FAVORITE OF HIS BOOKS HOWEVER, IT IS STILL ENJOYABLE TO READ THROUGH AND I AM SURE I GOT MORE OUT OF THAN I REALIZE. I ENJOY HIS WRITING AND RESEARCH THAT EXPLAINS THE WHYS AND WHENS OF THE ITEMS HE GOES OVER."
3,Disappointing,"This toy looks much bigger in the pictures than it really was in person. If I'd have seen it first, we would not have bought it for $26. There isn't much to it and it really should have been, at least, double it's size. It's OK for a table top toy, but not really as a floor toy. There are so many nicer toys like this that are less expensive. The spiral lift on the side doesn't really spin down well. My 2-year old grandson gets frustrated at trying to lift it up to the top. You can't tell if it's supposed to be wound up or just pushed up. It's not smooth. The sounds are entertaining and ELMO is Aiden's favorite character right now. His Daddy is a fire fighter. That's why we chose this for his birthday."
3,Nothing to it,There really isn't much to this toy. My son didn't play with it for more than a few minutes at a time.
4,Another great Giggle and go set,My 18 month old son received many of the giggle and go sets for Xmas- this did not disappoint like the rest of them. WE paid around $20 for ours and I felt that was a resonable.
5,Elsa & Fred.....Great Movie.,This is one of the funniest and at the same time saddest of movies.My wife has seen it 3 times.
5,ASLEEP IN THE LIGHT,ASLEEP IN THE LIGHT IS SIMPLY THE GREATEST CHRISTIAN CONTEMPORARY ROCK SONG EVER INSPIRED-----HANDS DOWN. THIS SONG ALONE IS WORTH THE PURCHASE AND SETS THE BAR FOR CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC AND WHAT IT SHOULD STRIVE TO BE!
4,"Good Music, Period","Keith Green wrote and performed contemporary gospel music. His songs have tend to have a *soft rock* sound, typical for the era in which he wrote (the 70's). Some obvious resemblances include Billy Joel and Cat Stevens. Green was also an accomplished keyboard player, and all round musician. That is what makes these songs worth listening to even if you do not share his particular Christian message.Some of these songs are very powerful (and critical) letters written to the Christian community. Also, the way he changes tempo and keys keeps the songs fresh sounding. This is one of my favorite albums from the 70's. Like much of the music from that era, some of it (especially the *earnestness* with which he sings) has not aged particularly well, but still is musically interesting."
5,One of the best CDs of 1998,"Easily on my 1998 top-5 CD list. The stylistic range covered here is awesome, and I don't (personally) care for a couple of the torchier selections, but there is a aolid groundwork of tremendous songs, many of which I hadn't heard before. Unwanted Number and Indoor Fireworks stand out as classics."
3,Patterns,"If you are looking for ideas on what to do, it is not a bad book. If you are looking for patterns on designs, this is not the book for you. This book is just a collection of some of his work, which is not what I was looking for."
5,Love these sunglasses!!,"These are just perfect for me - really beautiful. I have a wide face and they are not tight (and some sunglasses are). They sit close to your eyeballs, but don't touch my eyelashes. The vents on the side seem to prevent any moisture in the hot sun, but when it got up to around 100 degrees + humidity this summer, I wore them down my nose a bit. I love the color of the lenses especially. I find that I don't have to take them off & on so much going inside & back out. It's my go-to pair of sunglasses, and I have 10 pair. Love them! And the company I bought them from thru Amazon Marketplace had them shipped quickly... arrived to my house even before the expected delivery date."
5,Fantastic Glasses!!,"I love these Tom Ford sunglasses. Originally I thought I wanted the Whitney style which are exactly the same but larger frames. I tried them on at a big dept. store and decided I would research where to get the Jennifer style because they were $360 in the store. Ordered them from amazon for $210.love them! They fit my face very well and are comfortable. The only negative to the glasses is that they fit right on your face - against your cheeks. I have been wearing Aviators which have nosepads and only sit on my nose so that has taken some time to get used to. Plus, with it being so hot right now ( I live in NC) I may them steam up! However, when the weather cools they are goign to be perfect. THey look great and the lenses are good too."
4,"Beautiful and haunting, just like her sister.","I discovered Maire through being a fan of her sister Enya who've I've been listening to for some 20 some-odd years. Maire's vocal style seems more Irish to me and I appreciate the contrast even though they sound a lot alike. In some ways her music sounds more modern, but it doesn't distract from the excellent ethereal qualities of her voice. I'm very glad to have discovered her."
4,Etheral Journey,"This album is a bit more of a depature for Maire. There is less traditional style elements, and more 'modern Celtic new age' themes.Continues with the religious themes brought up in 'Perect Time' this does push more toward Enya's style.The copy I acquired was printed in Japan so I got a bonus track only available on that copy.As always she has such a style in mixing Gaelic and english lyrics.This goes beyond the typical Clannad albums and is truely more etheral and surreal. Wonderful mood music."
4,Good album worth owning,"Although I prefer her sister Enya, Ms. Brennan is well worth listening to. The Christian influence is not too intrusive for those who won't like it in this generally good album. I thought it was a nice touch having her son doing that recitation in Gaelic even though I didn't understand a word of it."
5,Better with Age,"I'd have to say Maire's done it again. Her newest album, Whisper to the Wild Water, is, I think, her best solo album she has out so far. Filled with wonderful Irish melodies and haunting lyrics Maire mixes contemporary beats with the traditional Gaelic and Irish instruments (ulinean pipes, Irish harp, etc.) which has made her famous. She blends her christianity in so well it appeals to both non-christians and christians. The lyrics and music mix well with the powerful opening track, Follow the Word, to the lovely prayer, Peacemaker with her son, Paul, on it, and the deeply moving Ageless Messengers, Maire has gotten better with age. I recomend this to any Clannad or Enya fan or someone who just likes music. Whisper to the Wild Water is deeply moving and I can't wait until Maire comes out with her next album."
4,A must for your cd collection!,"Maire Brennan keeps getting better and better. The angelic voice, lush harmonies and celtic rythms make this a stand-out album. Maire's spiritual awakening has given her a peace that flows from her music and wraps the listener like a warm blanket. The only thing that could have improved this album would have been the inclusion of Ciaran, Noel, and Padraig (the other members of Clannad)and their soothing harmonies. Lets hope that the inclusion of Maire's son Paul means that the Brennan tradition will live on for years to come."
5,wonderful!,"truly a WONDERFUL cd! Great mixture of spirtual with celtic tempo! If you're into celtic music, don't pass this one up for anything!!!! Between Ms. Brennan's voice and the songs, you will be carried away to a place of harmony and peace.Hopefully the next Clannad album will be out soon too!!!"
4,Whisper to the Wild Waters,"If you are an Enya fan, you'll love this. I am definately going to get it!"
5,"A ""must have"" for every Neurologist's library","Companion to Clinical Neurology (Medicine)Bill Pryse-Phillips' masterwork is an absolute treasure for anyone interested in the clinical neurosciences and a must for every personal medical library.Most anything relative to the clinical neurosciences is referenced and defined making the search for obscure clinical signs or eponyms a cinch.Great reading, cleverly composed and incredibly useful."
5,Take the plunge!,"Awesome!!! Don't visit the loo without it! Bathroom jokes aside, it's overflowing with great facts and humor and the writing is superb (lots of great, undiscovered talent here). If you haven't visited Minnesota yet, you will want to after reading these excellent essays. And if you are a Minnesotan, you will chuckle and nod your head and maybe even say ""wow, I didn't know that"" about a tidbit or two."
5,Great Filter,I have owned this for over a year now an have it installed in my Mazda 2. Excellent filter and you will notice the difference almost immediately. Don't forget the cleaning an oiling kit.
5,"marinco 150BBIW marine on- board charger inlet (15A, 125 v, white )",I did not want to cut the electrical wires to my guest 2611a dual bank chargerto install a plug. I found this inlet plug specifically designed for my 2611a guest charger. I am pleased with this product.
5,Solid and Well-built,"I was looking for a weather-proof, external connection for connecting a solar panel on the outside of my travel trailer to the charge controller inside the trailer. This connector was perfect for the job! I would highly recommend this item to other Amazon shoppers. It appears that this item will hold up for many years of service."
1,poor imitation,this is not the actual book of the TV series it is a paperback summery and teachers guide with none of the original content
1,Didn't notice any affect.,Two weeks in & absolutely zero affect noticed when taking this. No increased energy. This would seem to be a placebo only
1,no results,"the ingredients are there, but you need high doses. would look somewhere else unless you are pretty receptive to supplements."
1,...,I Loved the first one but some how they found a way to butcher it. Weak story line and BAD gameplay are 2 of the games many problems. ...
1,I would give it no stars if I could!,"This game is a waste of money. I played the first game and it [was bad] like a taco canned rice and jellybeans. I thought this one might be good because of improvement in disc space and graphics, but they just [messed] this up. The concept is one of the best I've ever seen. Run a city to make it simple. However, the gameplay is so utterly terrible that the few good aspects of the game are completely countered.Don't buy this game. I like tacos, but I have to advise against eating thi one. I like Mexican food!"
2,"Moronic ai and pathing makes what could be fun, annoying","This game is kind of simple and would be fun if it weren't for pathing and AI that makes the original Warcraft look smart. If your gangsters are wanted by the police, and getting shot at, they will pace back and forth in front of the cops like ducks in a shooting gallery until dead. This happens ALOT.Also, if you tell someone, say a wimpy specialist, to go somewhere, he takes the direct route, even if it takes him past a hundred enemy troops (well, he'll be dead after 12 so no matter)The idiotic ai takes what could be a simple but fun game and makes it feel like someone just wnated to put out their software a couple of months before they were finished.A patch could fix this, but not too likely from eidos, customer service isn't very important nowadays.Avoid this game.--Alex"
1,"If you really want this game, just let me give you mine","Boring and dull. You lose all control over the game to the scripted missions that you must complete,(and by the way, it is confusing as to HOW each one is supposed to be complete) and you can't buy weapons or cars until the third or fourth level. The first gangsters, despite its flaws, was one hundered times better. Instead of making improvements on the first one, it seems that they just made a totally different game with gangsters and called it ""Gangsters 2"". This game reminds me of Heist."
2,What a letdown.,"I had high hopes for this one, because despite the original Gangsters' tedious gameplay, I really enjoyed its detail and depth. As far as strategy and gameplay though, Gangsters 2 is nothing like the original. Sure its graphics are an improvement but its gameplay, for the most part, is shallow, repetitive and dull. I imagine the boys at Hothouse Creations spent a lot of time and effort designing Gangsters 2 but I just can't fathom why they would think this game would be appealing. Each mission seems to be a repeat of the previous and ah blah, blah, blah...What's the point? This game blows! It hasn't been out two weeks and it is already marked down at Best Buy. My suggestion? Buy a book!"
4,Gangsters is good,"Gangsters 2 is a fairly good game, with good controls, and Eidos payed good attention to the details of the hits, bombings, and drive-bys you carry out. The only real problem that I see in it is that even on the easy setting, the game is hard. The gangsters you fight keep getting harder, and you seem to keep getting less and less money as the missions go on. You think that the fact that you get more cars, start with some muscle for Bane, and are allowed to bring more gangsters would even out, but in the end the only thing that matters is the cold, hard cash. Without it, you don't stand a chance at winning, and it's hard to get any cash when every illegal business you setup the enemy is on in a second killing the specialist. Those are the only overall flaws with the game."
2,"quite scholarly, very tedious, hard to read","This is not a book for the ordinary seeker after truth. It is much too philosophical, more for graduate school exercises in religious thought."
2,"Interface is slow, slow, slow.","Software interface takes much too long to load, and the slide and negative scans are poor quality.Everytime you scan a new image, the ""scanner lamp"" warming up message appears, even if you've just used the scanner. This typically takes 15-20 seconds.After the warm-up, if you need to switch from the default flatbed mode to a slide or film mode, the ""scanner lamp"" warming up appears still again.Software installs with all sorts of bundled stuff for the average user, but most annoying to get rid of when you don't want it, like the e-fax (electronic fax service). After using the uninstall, I found I had to go through the registry and manually delete efax entries to keep the button from appearing on every program on my computer.After installing, I hauled out my older Visioneer -- better scans, better price, faster GUI."
3,Works good for winME but NOT WinXP.,"I liked the scanner and it worked in WinME very well but when I upgraded to WinXP (clean install) I could not even install the software from HP's site on my computer. That is the reason I purchased this scanner because it was to be XP compliant. Don't get this if you are going to upgrade to XP, it will not work...."
5,Unbeatable price and fast free shipping!,"Heading says it all ""unbeatable price and fast free shipping!"" what else could you ask for?"
4,Good,"This is a good compilation of the Tony Martin era of Black Sabbath which started with Eternal Idol, which btw is not on here because it's not on the IRS record company. So get that and this and you should get a good glimpse of, while not as popular as Ozzy, is a much better vocalist and the sound more acessable. Key tracks are: Headless Cross, When Death Calls, The Sabbath Stones, Devil And Daughter and Valhalla. Though the track listing has two each of the Forbidden album which imo is their weakest album and Cross Purposes. Should've included Anno Mundi, but overall it's a good compilation."
1,James JT Taylor not on this CD,Do not buy this CD. You will be disappointed. Imagine buying a Beatles Live CD with no Paul McCartney. Imagine a Commodores Live cd with no Lionel Ritchie. Imagine any group without their vocal identity and that's what you get from this cd. I would normally commend Rhino records for releasing rare tracks from artist of days gone by. I feel short changed by this release. It is very misleading that they have a picture with JT Taylor on the cover. Talk about false advertising.
1,"NOT THE ""REAL"" THING","On face value, I was thrilled to see there was an offering of Kool & the Gang live. On face value, it appears JT is the lead signer from the packaging and the like. Much to my dissapointment, it was recorded while he was not with the group.It's just not the same without JT on lead, and I was greatly dissapointed at the misrepresentation."
2,Just Not the Same,"Whoa! Unfortunately I am a sucker for live music, because nothing could prepare me for this....a ""J.T. less"" Kool & the Gang with inadequate vocals! While the band itself is in good form, it is somewhat disconcerting to know that this disc was packaged as having ALL of the members of the band. Additionally, who REALLY needs a concert taken from 1993? My advice: ""save your money and buy the studio greatest hits package."""
3,Not Bad but JT Is Needed!!!,"Kool and The Gang was without a doubt one of the best R&B Bands of the late seventies and eighties. It is nice hearing these old classic dance tunes. Whereas the substitute singer certainly has a nice voice, it just does not have the appropriate textures that JT Taylor had specifically on Joanna. On top of that, Joanna is a little bit rushed as compared to the studio version. The guitar work is quite electrifying on Emergency and quite spunky on Too Hot. This is an OK CD but I am going for one of the compilations."
1,NO ONE CAN SING THESE SONGS LIKE JAMES J.T. TAYLOR!,"I was shocked and dismayed to find this compilation of classic Kool & The Gang hits had even been released in 1998. Why? Because it is missing the main ingredient that made these songs hits in the first place.. . . the incomparable voice of Mr. J.T. Taylor. Recorded in 1993 while J.T. was away from the group, there is no way I can thrill to ""Celebration"", ""Ladies Night"", or any of the other smash gems, without the sultry tones and magnificent vocal control of the ""original"" J.T. Any other singer is just child's play. If I had been properly informed of the personnel lineup on the CD beforehand, I would not have spent good money on this recording."
2,"Without JT, the songs just aren't the same.","These Kool & the Gang songs are great, but only when they are sung by lead singer, JT Taylor. When he left the group, they were just not the same. This CD contains live versions of most of the songs originally sung by him; but he isn't the lead singer on this CD. Therefore, it isn't worth buying. Their old stuff before JT is great, but nobody can replace what he did with the group."
2,Krafttech 7.2 volt Drill/Driver with reverse/forward,Mine lasted several years and then would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of hours shelf life ............. lots less if used even light duty.Can not find a replacement battery. User manual for some reason advises against battery replacement.What a waste of resources !
1,a waste of money,This was a gift to me because I have difficulty using a screwdriver manually. I think I used this 5-6 times before the battery would no longer charge. A waste of money for anyone.
3,Cost per unit is too high,"Like all Fein products, they do the job but the cost/benefit ratio is too high. I have moved to some other brand sanding sheets at 75% of cost."
5,Great value,"I've had this model for about 2 months. For the price I paid ($599) it's a great machine. You'll pay double for a comparable Dell. It's small, lightweight, and runs smoothly. It does have a lot of included software, but some of the Toshiba stuff is pretty neat, like the touchpad utility (you can assign corners to different tasks)."
4,Not bad,"I really dont care for Jurmaine Dupree, but this album was well done. I liked ""Lets get married"". I thought it was something different coming from a male group. (Us men talking about marriage? ) Even though a few of the cuts didnt need J.D. on them it is still a good album."
5,NO ONE DOES IT BETTER!,"""Heartbreak"" is honestly the best R&B album I have ever heard in my life. These guys are untouchable in their field. Ironically, the group they got the album name ""Heartbreak"" from, New Edition, used to be my favorite group. I did not think anyone could replace them until I heard Jagged Edge's material. Every song has the potential to be a hit single and I just can't hear the CD enough. It is the first time I bought a CD 3 times . One for the house, car and girlfriend. Jagged Edge is definitely on their way to stardom. I did'nt think they could top their last album, which is also a classic, but they did. They're sound and style is unmatched. Keep bringin' it fellas and I'll keep buyin' it!"
3,not bad,This is okay if you feel jagged edge but nothing that too much excites me they are talented and jd is the best thing they got going for them.
3,A Good Album But...,"Their first and third album ""Jagged Little Thrill"" are the best efforts out to date. This album is full with ballads which are the standouts of this album but overall this album is fulfilling and can't wait for a new album from them.F.Y.I: They are back on SoSoDef with J.D. and are now signed to Island/DefJam."
5,This album deserves more than FIVE stars!!!,"These four fine brothas have soulful voices and harmonized tunes that make you wanna sing along to every song. I loved every single song on this cd. My favorite track was #10 Promise.Jagged Edge is the best R&B male group out today. No other group can compare with them right now. Every song they come out becomes a hit in my book. This is a album where you can just pop into your cd and let it play till it reaches the end.I will forever remain a fan of Jagged Edge! Their talents are endless and they will for sure go far in the music industry.Jermaine Dupri you did a excellent job with this group and thank you for creating such a group that will keep their audience entertained. I LOVED this group! I say ""I Do"" to their music every time!!!!"
2,Weak,"Jagged Edge's latest just isn't very good. It seems as though Jagged Edge have lost their ability to sing. On the only good songs of the album (""Let's get married"", ""Keys to the range"", and ""He can't love you"") they do an OK job, but it's the production that saves those songs. On the other songs, the production isn't as good and the woeful lack of vocal talent becomes apparent. I would suggest that you get their first album first if you just want some JE. On that album, the production is more consistent (at least for the first six songs), and though it's shorter than their second (10 compared to 12), there are more good songs on the first album (6 compared to 3). If you're willing to consider other albums for purchase, I'd recommend Joe's latest, and if you have Joe's and you like it, I'd recommend Profyle and Ideal (who each have a similar style to Joe, but they are both groups)."
5,Excellent,I really liked the songs on the new album you guys did a great job on this album keep up the good work and in all things put god first and all of your goals will be accomplished in the end.
1,Heartbreak or Ear Ache?,"Jagged Edge's second attempt to me was no better than the first.Jagged gave me two songs that I listen to and the rest is pure filler. I stopped buying their music after the second album. Even though their specialty is ballads, it seems that's all they can do and quite frankly, I can't sit there and listen to someone give anesthesia from my player. I love ballads like the next person, but variety is the spice of life and they are just not providing it for me again. Disappointing! Grade: F"
4,A HEARTBREAK FOR SURE,THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST CD'S OF THE NEW MILLENIUM. THE GROUP CAME OUT OF THE GATE A WHOLE LOT FASTER THAN THE LAST ALBUM. I WISH THEM A LOT OF LUCK ON THIS PLATINUM RIDE.
4,To Be Listened To With The One You Love,"I love Jagged Edge. Their almost gospel sound just makes my heart melt. And this CD was definitely one that I rushed out and bought the very day that it went on sale. Their timeless sound appeals to young and old, and you can't help but love the down-to-earth lyrics and the sweet melodies."
4,Great music!,"Forget the singing (back to that later), the production on this CD is tighter than vice grips. The opening track, ""Let's Get Married"", and ""He Can't Luv You"" had me sitting at my keyboard (Yamaha PSR-530) for hours. Musically, this disc is recommended.Now for the singing. I'm not a big fan of Jagged Edge, but I liked their singles. The lyrics are average R&B pander, but the harmonies are tight and the vocals are nicely arranged. From what I've heard, they sound better on this album than on the debut. However, they don't sing all over each other like they do at their shows (y'all know what I'm talking about).Overall, you can't go wrong with this CD. I liked it and I'm not even a fan."
4,Too Late!,"I really liked the Heartbreak c.d. I have always liked JaggedEdge even when their last c.d. didn't do so well. For a few monthsI've waited on their c.d's release. To me, the c.d. is very in touch with the feelings and emotions that go on in a relationship. Basically I can identify with most of the songs.Too bad it came out a few months to late for me and my relationship, because those songs summed up how I felt about my man in a nutshell. I still dedicate the whole album to him (D. Thomas 11/04/81). The album sounds better listening to it with someone you care about. Try it out. Jagged Edge thank you for releasing a fantastic album."
5,Jagged Edge is the bomb,"Personally, I love Jagged Edge new cd. The disc is off the chain. My favorite songs are What cha' trying to do for it, I promise, Healing, Lets get married, True man, and Lace you. If you want some kick back with your girl/guy music then you wll absolutely love this disc. It is worth the money."
1,Once it's on it may never come off.,"While I don't have any evidence to refute the package claim that it ""attaches to any notebook"", once attached to my son's computer it was almost impossible to remove. It took 10 minutes to get it off and we were pulling so hard I thought we would damage the computer. We will be returning it. Not recommended."
1,Mind of its own,"Was given one of these for my laptop at work. Seemed OK, so I got one for my daughter to use at school and we set and tested the combination before she left.When she got the lock on, the same combination was suddenly not working to get it open so I had to take a hacksaw to it during a campus visit.Now the same thing has just happened to the one I have at work. Fortunately it happened when I was trying to put it on.These phantom combination resets make the product very unreliable."
1,Heed the warnings!,I set the new combination. It worked fine twice. The third time it got stuck in my ibook. I had to cut it off. Do not buy this lock.
1,Dont buy,"Everything that happened to other people happened to me. I have an Ibook, used the lock for about two months total. I bought it last year and used it for the month of October before I started to just lock my office. During that month I never set the lock to any combo. It remained at the 0-0-0-0. I used it for one month this year and it is already broken. I was having trouble with it for about two weeks before it final broke. That brings by total time used to six weeks of normal use. I would not recommend this product to anyone and if I was able to get te lock out of my comp I would not even sell it or give it away b/c it is worthless. [...] I would give this item 0 stars if it were possible."
1,Cheap,"After bolting the cable to the wall, I attempted to set the combination. In order to choose the combination you want, you use a flat head screw driver to unscrew and loosen the lock so you can rotate the number dials. Then, just tighten it up again. I did this. However, when I went to test out the combination I set, it didn't work! And when I went to unscrew it to reset it, my attempts at unscrewing the cheap screw stripped the head and I was unable to reset it. I called the company and they said they would replace it but only if I sent them the old one. Now I have to spend my time and my money to get a cheap lock replaced. And, based on the other reviews of locks spontaneously changing combinations anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if this happened again."
1,Just don't do it!,"This lock is absolutely a piece of crap. The lock reset after a few uses and was stuck in my computer. When I called the company, this is what they emailed me:SUGGESTION 1: Manual DecodingStart with 0000 and sequentially enter combinations until you find the proper combination. Remember to press the silver button after each number change. On average, it takes about 45 minutes to discover the code. While manual decoding may seem to be a time consuming option, it prevents damage to the notebook and allows the user to continue to use the DEFCON CL.SUGGESTION 2: Sawing off the DEFCON CLUsing a hacksaw with a metal cutting blade, saw through the plastic head and metal post as shown in the picture below. You can then unscrew the portion of the metal post that remains in your computer.I cut the cable with wire cables to make it portable again and then started at 0000. I finally stumbled upon my code. This lock is crap as is Targus's costumer service."
1,"Lock stuck, thankfully outside computer","I had this and liked it until one day it just stopped opening and closing. Thankfully it was outside my computer so I'm just buying a new one. I tried WD40 and nothing, stuck. I just went to Staples and Best Buy (ridiculous) and this is the only lock both carry so I'm on Amazon buying a new one. I thought it might have just been me but it was redeeming to see the low rating on amazon. How are they still selling this?"
1,"Internal mechanism can break--even with the right combo, lock is stuck on!","My lock seemed to be fine for the first few months. Suddenly, once, it wouldn't come off my computer. I checked; the combination is correct (the button can be pushed only when the combination is correct), however, the internal mechanism broke and the lock was permanently stuck to my computer.Again, mine was not a combination problem; it was an insoluble problem with the inner mechanism. Since you won't know if yours has the same flaw, you may want to think about another lock."
1,Worst lock EVER,"This lock is the worst lock ever made, the lock resets itself so you cannot unlock it. To remove the lock you have to cut the wire (super easy) and saw the lock off. In the process damaging my computer. This product should be taken off the market."
1,Do Not Buy!,"Heed the warnings from the reviewers that indicated ""mysterious combination changes"", especially if you own an Apple laptop! I bought this for my son to use in college and after one week of use he called to tell me that the combination no longer worked!!!!"
3,Does as advertised,"This thing does what it is supposed to an nothing more. I don't feel extremely safe leaving it unwatched even with this on, but it certainly makes my laptop less appealing to steal. If someone really wants you're notebook, this thing will only slow them down. So don't swear by it. I feel this item is slightly overpriced, but so are all laptop locks. No real problems with this item, just nothing great either."
1,"DON""T BUY IT, I BEG YOU!!!","piece of junk, wasted 20 some dollars!!!!! OMG, please, do yourself a favor, don't buy even if it's free, don't get it, period!!!"
1,Lock changes combination by itself - Do not buy,I have been using this lock for a few months without changing the combination. Suddenly I could no longer open it as it appears that the lock has changed its combination by itself.I called engineering in the hotel I was staying in to help me. It took them less than a minute to cut the cable with ordinary pliers.
1,"Lock jammed, so I had to break it off","I just finished breaking this lock off my laptop because it somehow jammed. My laptop was securely locked in my hotel room, keeping even a person with the combination from removing it. After a couple of quick blows with a ratchet handle, the lock itself broke apart. Once I took the end off the lock, it popped right off the laptop. See my photos above of the smashed lock.When I bought this, I joked to my buddy that it would now take a thief 30 seconds longer to steal my laptop. If only I had realized how right I was. The only reason I spent half an hour trying to remove it was because I was trying to save the lock. I'll call the manufacturer to ask for a refund tomorrow. If they don't give me one, I'll take it back to Staples, where I bought this just six weeks ago."
1,Not For Apple ibook,"DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE AN iBOOK!! It slides in easily, but it is almost impossible to get out. I had to call their support line and they told me to apply pressure in the upper left corner (lower right corner if the lock is upside down). Even after doing that, it took me 10 minutes before I finally got it out. When I called, the guy asked me if I had an ibook before anything else. He then told me that they are tight in the ibooks and people have trouble getting them out. It is not worth the struggle if you have an ibook. I highly do not recommend this product for apple ibooks."
1,Have an iBook? Don't buy this lock!,"I posted a review two weeks ago, but it hasn't appeared, so I'm trying again...I bought this lock two years ago. It has always been difficult to remove. (Note: despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.) Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it. After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out. That took over 30 minutes of struggle. My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw. Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks. I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation. If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus."
1,"Krap with a capital ""K""","My boyfriend has been using this lock daily for the past 4 months to secure his laptop at work. Today it decided that the combination he had set was inadequate, so it reset itself. Now we cannot get his laptop off his desk, which defeats the purpose of having a portable computer. We strongly suggest buying a lock that unlocks via a key. Do not purchase this lock."
1,Beating a dead horse...,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing but to beat a dead horse, the combination changed on its own. I guess I need to smash the lock--seems to be the quickest way to get this out of my laptop without hurting my laptop. This whole situation is ridiculous!"
1,Suddenly changes key,"Do not buy unless you want to play ""thieves and safes"". I took about an hour to unlock my laptop and I arrived late to an important meeting."
2,You'll think you are a safe-cracker,"I inherited one of these by finding it in an office I took over. I found some instructions via Google about how to crack it, however I found that rotating each tumbler in turn until a noticeable slip was felt gave me an open lock at the first attempt. I am NOT an expert at picking locks. Now, this may be an older version (it matches the second picture), but I think the only thing I am going to use it for now is party tricks..."
1,It will absolutely turn out to be your headache,"I bought Defcon CL about a year ago. The lock suddenly changed the combination code that I reset once on its own.I think it is because of the failure of its mechanical design, which means that the failure will certainly happen to every user at some point. Just imagine if your precious laptop were locked out when you desperately need it in some other places. I think the company should recall this product right now."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,They HAVE NOT resolved the issues with this lock. It is pathetically poor. I am grateful for not having put it on the laptop before finding out that it is junk.
1,Got stuck one too many times,I used this lock for about six months before finally tossing it. It occasionally got stuck but I was always able to jiggle it open eventually (after about 5 minutes). Finally last week it got stuck and no amount of jiggling was able to unstick it. Finally forced it open by using pliers to force the button down (the combination was right the whole time) after a few days of carrying around the whole cable. Not a good lock if you want something dependable.
1,WARNING! This lock can be maliciously reset!,"This and similar models are still for sale in stores, I can't believe it!I've discovered how to purposely scramble the combo from a locked state, so I can believe it would randomly change its combo as well.Targus tech support said they'd pass on the info to HQ but didn't care to take my contact info.Unfortunately their new Ultra Max apparently has the same lousy lock design.I would not buy a combo lock from them until they make fundamental changes."
1,"Lock autonomously decided ""You didn't want that combination, anyway.""","I used this lock A-OK for years. On Saturday 2008/09/27 I used it fine twice. When I wanted to unlock my notebook computer from the desk the following Monday, the lock acted as if I entered the wrong combination. I'm baffled. Now I have to cut it off. Will my notebook computer ever be rid of the lock dangling from the side? Now I'll look like a computer thief."
5,"Cheap, Amazing Lock","I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, I bought the combo lock and the key lock and they both work great for me. I take them to starbucks all the time and no one touches my laptop. This is a great BUY, WORTH YOUR MONEY"
3,Too Sensitive to Motion,"Mine goes off with little or no motion. It almost seems that its own ""beep"" causes enough motion to make it ""beep"", which causes it to ""BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP""..... So I don't set it. The saving grace is that even if I don't set it, the alarm always goes off if the cable is cut. The thinness of the cable plus its retractability make it easier to travel with than the thick cables."
5,Mixed UP Reviews - Try This.,"Not one single review here is about the actual item for sale. When I clicked on the product reviews for this item. The item is the Targus PA460U DEFCON Authenticator - Black [Electronics] Which in fact has nothing to do with combination locks, cable locks, Or for that matter any kind of locking device other than a programed security device which locks down your computer so no one can enter your files without you being present. Unless of course they have the same finger print as you. It can also work for more than on computer at a time if for save you have two linked together in your network and prefer you children (example) or whomever to have acess to your computer when you are not present. All I can say is that mine works great and I very happy I have one."
1,Targus PA400U DEFCON 1 Ultra Notebook Computer Security System,"I had this for approximately 2 years. It worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances. One day I left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour. During this period, the alarm was activated and I was embarrased to face my office workers. This is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm. I sent it back to Targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm. But after several months, it started the same problem.So, now I am afraid to use this security system with my laptop. But I did not face problems like changing the combination by its own. You can use it without the alarm activation (i.e: without batteries) but the cable is so thin, it is not recommended to protect any valubles."
4,It IS a true story!,"I watched this recently on DVD in South Africa - it is frighteningly realistic - the accents, cars etc etc. This is the TRUE story of the Andre Stander legacy - I remember him and his gang being in the news all the time - each time getting more and more adventurous. Get it - watch it - great movie as well as being factually correct - 90% of the time."
5,The sleeper film of the year,"This film was only shown about half a dozen times in obscure places over the country, but from what I've heard it looks to be the underground hit of the year. It's amazing how little buzz was recieved, but it's finally coming to DVD in December, just as King Arthur comes out too.The movie is about a guy named John Stander, played by the underrated Thomas Jane who seems to have the worst luck in getting decent acting roles. He is a South African cop, who is fed up with the brutality of police towards a revolution. So therefore, he decides to go into crime, and becomes one of the most successful bank robbers in history. As quirky a plot as this may seem, it's supposedly all a true story.I don't know any technical details yet about the DVD itself, but it's only a couple of months away. Anyway, check this out. It's promising to be a big underground sucess."
4,"Solid: That's Good, but not Great","3 1/2 stars. A solid, underrated little movie - a strange combo of biopic, character study, and old-school heist flick set in apartheid era South Africa. It doesn't completely hold together (hence the star rating), but there's a nicely retro, '70's feel to all of this. It's all refreshingly grown-up, and is a good showcase for Thomas Jane - an actor who, sadly, hasn't achieved the visibility or status that he could have."
4,Stander is great,"Stander is a great movie, and Jane proves he is a great actor. I don't know much about the history of the movie or how accurate its telling was to the true story, but it keeps your interest from the beginning. I recommend the movie to anyone who likes crime movies or action. It gets a bit slow from time to time, but Jane's portrayal of someone disillusioned with his life keeps you locked into the plot."
2,"Am I ""Politically Correct"" Yet?","After reading some glowing reviews of this movie, I made a point of seeing it. Was I disappointed!Pompous, preachy, self-important, and--worst of all--really dull.Despite being ""based on a true story"", it's a plot you've seen many times before, especially in Australian movies. (Think ""Ned Kelly"".) Especially when people start cheering Stander as a folk hero (for robbing banks?), I got a real sense of deja vu.Don't waste your time, even if you're a big Thomas Jane fan--I am, and I still hated this movie."
1,Bank robbing a protest against Apartheid? Give me a break!,"Based on a true story, the 2003 film sounded interesting. It's set in South Africa and starts in the 1970s when the evils of Apartheid were apparent. At that time Andre Stander was a young newly-married police officer. During an uprising, he shot and killed an unarmed protester. This disturbed him so much that he turned to bank robbing. Eventually he went to prison for this. In prison, he met up with a couple of fellow inmates. They escaped and went on a bank robbing spree. The ending is inevitable.How the criminal bank robbing activity was a protest against Apartheid is rather fuzzy. But I watched the film anyway, always waiting for something to grab my sympathy. The film is almost two hours long and I was soon bored. Now I think I should have turned it off early, rather than waiting for the end. But I saw every single scene. What a waste of time!"
3,The Green Hornet: Movie Edition from VCI,"Here is an honest review of VCI's dvd of ""The Green Hornet: Movie Edition"" and the extras therein:The original serial is edited down to an 84-minute feature film. What you get on this dvd is two versions of the same cut. The first one has a sepia tint throughout with occasional green tints, yellow tints, pink, orange (and combinations thereof) thrown in for good measure.. as well as beefed-up sound effects here and there. The second version is the original B&W; print without psychedelic doodling from the boffins in the colorizing suite and it's far the superior version. A good print in glorious monochrome. This second print of the film is to be found in the ""Extras"" section of the dvd. You also get the first two chapters of the original serial. Both chapters are fine prints as well.That's all you'll get here and, for the price, it's a fair deal. There are no radio shows nor photo galleries as another review has started.Enjoy!"
4,Re-packaged King Biscuit Flower Hour Live,"This is yet another a re-packaging of their excellent King Biscuit Flower Hour Live CD with only 10 tracks instead of the original 14. If you have the King Biscuit CD, pass. If not and the price is right, this is a pretty good CD. King Biscuit is getting plenty of mileage out of that original 1982 concert where these performances were recorded."
3,Good but over produced,"This was their first album as a duo and it is not bad, but I agree that it was over produced by George Martin. It was America's first commercial flop, failing to crack the Billboard Top 100 Albums chart in 1978 despite including live recordings of many songs that had been big hits just a few years ealier. I think they would have been better off without the backing orchestra and tried for a more ""classic rock"" style performance which was more typical of their live shows."
2,Made my hair fall out....,"I started taking this because it was recommended on Dr. Oz for thin hair. I also started taking Biosil at the same time, again in hopes of thickening my locks.My hair started falling out by the handful. It was scary, because it was about 4x the usually amount that normally falls out. I couldn't figure out what it was until I went on vacation a couple of months later and stopped taking these two supplements (I continued on with my regular vitamins, supplements, etc). About a week after I stopped taking it, my hair stopped falling out.So technically I don't know if it was this or the Biosil that caused my hair to fall out, but I'm definitely not going to risk taking either again to find out!"
4,good melodic/power metal,"Has all the elements and the lyrics sound medival like Manowar. If you like other different bands like Dark Moor, Gamma Ray, Sonata Arctica, Sky Lark, Labyrinth, Avalanch, you will like this European band."
1,Wrong Picture,"Amazon or seller please put up the correct picture to go with the product name. I'm interested in Larry Norman's ""Sticks and Stone"" but the picture is of something else. With this discrepency, I think I'll just look elsewhere. I think you'd get a more people interested if you put the proper picture of Larry Norman's ""Sticks and Stones"" next to the product description. Shoppers, this is actually a 5+ CD (The cd by Larry Norman ""Sticks and Stones"") Thanks"
1,Transfers fine but does not charge the X5,This cable will allow you to transfer files to the X5 but it does NOT charge the X5 at all. I have one and it doesn't charge.
3,Not bad for the price,"It does very good job of cutting , but it does not collect the dust very good ."
1,saw has small arbor,"This saw comes with a 5/8"" arbor to mount the blade. It is almost impossible to find replacement blades. Most 12"" mitre saws use a 1"" arbor to mount the blades. I sent the saw back without even using it due to the blade issue."
2,Poor quality material!,"This unit came out of the box with the vertical travel stop broken off the housing. The material that it was cast from appears to be some kind of low-grade aluminum. (We called it pot metal when I was a kid) The unit doesn't look nearly as good in actuality as it does in the picture. I had it back in the box within 20 minutes of the time it arrived. Return procedure to Amazon was excellent, however! I had a shipping label printed out and on the box in just a few minutes. I elected to drop the box at a UPS drop point rather than have them pick it up, which actually made things easier for me."
