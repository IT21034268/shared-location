5,I LOVE THIS CD!!!!!!,"If CD's could ever wear out, my Tribute to Janet Jackson CD would have worn out by yesterday. I listen to this CD 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!! I love this CD!! It's very convenient too because all of the Janet songs that I like are all on one CD so I don't have to switch from one CD to another to listen to my favorite songs. I'm listening to it as I write this review. I love this CD!!! The reviewer at the top doesn't know what he's talking about. Buy this CD!!!!"
5,THIS IS GREAT,"THIS HAS A COMPLETE SET OF GREAT JANET SONGS. FROM ""THATS THE WAY LOVES GOES"" TO ""IF"" WITH A TOUCH OF HER MOST RECENT HITS INCLUDING ""I GET LONELY"". YOU CAN'T MISS IF YOU JUST WANT A GREAT COLLECTION OF JANET SONGS WITH THIS ALBUM. WHAT MORE CAN I SAY BUY THIS ALBUM."
1,Janet Must Have Shed A Few Tears When She Heard This Mess!!!,"Two Words!!! - THIS SUCKS!!!Who - no Whatever voice that is butchering these classic Janet singles are making my ears bleed.What a waste of time, money and dedication!!!"
1,One Star Is Too High,"Are you a Janet fan? If so, then would you ever try and record lots of other people singing her songs? No, okay, then would you ever record her songs with other people singing badly? Didn't think so. Normally, I wouldn't say anything bad about someone's (lot's of people's) work, but it honestly is horrible. The women who sing on this CD don't sound like our beloved Jan. It is true, that all her songs that everyone likes are in one place...but Janet is not singing them! The sad thing is that when I bought this, I thought it was JJ, but I was just too naive to think someone would butcher J's music. It's sad."
2,"""You can't be serious""","First of all,no one can sing a Janet Jackson song like Janet. Y'ALL KNOW THAT! Second,someone should have been honest with these people when they started putting this thing together. ""IT'S TERRIBLE"". I gave a very generous 2 stars and that's only because they had the guts to release it."
1,Oh hell naw!,This is the worst tribute that have been made. It sounds like someone made this in their garage. My advice is not to buy it. This is nothing but pure trash and I'm a complete fan but the reason I have one star is because I had to put it there and they chose some good songs. At least I have an excuse to put that star there but you would not wanna waist a penny on that.
1,Complete and utter trash,"As a Janet fan, I was appalled that this cd is considered to be a ""tribute"" to Ms. Jackson. The vocalist lacks singing ability and sounds as if she recorded this cd while in the privacy of her own home singing along with the instrumentals. I would not recommend this cd @ all. Two thumbs down.....Way down!!! Oh and I only gave it one star because they wouldn't allow me to give it zero."
5,It works...,"It works exactly as described. I have a Toslink cable going directly from my 5.1 stereo system to my LCD TV. I also have a Toslink cable running out of the back of my Playstation 3 (not plugged into anything). I keep this device on the end of my PS3's cable. When I want to use my stereo with my PS3, all I have to do is unplug the Toslink cable from the TV and into the coupler. I do not have to worry about getting behind my stereo (in a small, cramped space in my entertainment center) to unplug the Toslink cable ever again. This is a great little product."
5,It Does What It Should,I purchased two of the toslink unions to extend my cables without purchasing very expensive longer cables. The delivery time was long and I sent an email to the customer service team to express my disappointment that it would take two to three weeks to deliver. The seller (not Amazon) emailed me back within hours to apologize and offer a full refund. I was so impressed with their desire to meet the customerâ€™s expectation; I kept the order in place and waited. The unions work perfectly without any loss of quality in my surround sound.
1,Disappointed,"Perhaps my runs were too long, but this just didn't work for me. The light was still as bright at ever on both ends so don't think it had anything to do with lead size, but rather this connector feels really flimsy, and is litterally a hollow tube with two snap in connectors. The wires wiggle a bit inside them- perhaps this is all that's needed but it would not work with my two 15' run cables."
1,Too short,"These seem nicely enough made but are too short. First snap a cable into one end, then try to snap a cable into the second end: it pushes the first cable out. There's no way to get the cables to both stay snapped in. I've tried this with two different brands of optical cables with the same results."
1,You can't possibly expect us to swallow this tripe.,Come back and write a book when your sole intention isn't just to show off how many four-syllable words you know. Garbage.
3,"Stylish, but too big to be carried everywhere.","This, and the other Potter Style books, are visually attractive, but too big to go everywhere. Also, the page layout is somewhat restrictive (so many lines for this, so many lines for that...), and the cover started showing signs of wear pretty quickly. My next food diary will be smaller: pocket-sized."
2,wrinkled reading,"This little book is way overpriced and the cover was wrinkled. I wanted to give it as a gift, but it was in much worse shape than indicated in the book seller's description. It wasn't worth the shipping charges."
4,good but...,"the meter works quite well, but is feature poor. unfortunately returning this one for another model (337) that costs 3.5 times as much to get one feature that I need"
3,NOT MADE IN USA,I am shocked that fluke does not make their products in the US anymore. I won't be purchasing anymore of their products and will pass this on to all my IBEW brothers and sisters.
4,Fluke 322 Clampmeter,"The Fluke 322 ClampMeter is almost everything I wanted/needed. There is one caveat: The DC voltage display only reads to one decimal place. So for marine corrosion measurements using a chloride half cell, mV accuracy is marginal."
4,Casa Howhard meets Die Hard meets Thelma & Louise,"This is a fast-paced and very graphic story. Our two main characters, a woman trying to leave her checkered past behind, and an eighteen-year-old natural transsexual just released from juvie hall, are just starting to enjoy their new freedom and beginnings when one of them is attacked at a gas station. Improper assumptions are made, accidents happen and the two are being blamed for a lot of bad trouble.But in their escape they manage to run afoul of some organized crime. Now they have the police as well as the mob after them.Plenty of action of all types; guns, explosions, fast cars, and plenty of sex. This is the first volume and really only just gets the story going but the reader really wants to see how they get out of this mess."
2,Not what I was looking for,"The artwork is splendid and in full color throughout. One of the main characters is a she-male, really just a guy that looks like a pretty girl. ""She"" doesn't even have female equipment below the waist-- she's all male. Not sexy. There are four lengthy sex scenes. There is some fetish stuff, including urination. The story is VERY violent, which to me is kind of a buzz kill. On the whole, I could have done without this one."
1,Try another perspective,"Wine in the Bible by Samuel Bacchiocchi is filled with historical research and documentation that will help you with the perspective of wine preservation and consumption of Biblical times. Read five of his chapters on line. Look for ""previews"" of the book. I really wanted to know if fermented wines are OK for Christians. You better read ALL of the arguments if you REALLY want to know the facts."
4,Super! (almost...),"What's not to love? The 9""x7"" book format is much better than the typical magazine size, all the articles are interesting, and almost no fluff.My only dislikes: The body type is really small, and some of the sidebars are set even smaller. Us older geeks really need a slightly larger font. I'm not a big fan of body copy set in sans-serif either, but can live with it.I subscribed, PLEASE ship this in a poly bag. The Post Office can to cruel things to a magazine."
2,Where's the content?!?,"I was super excited to add this magazine to my presigious bathroom reading pile. However, this particular issue lacked exciting content. I wish I bought the spud-gun issue. Steer clear of this issue, it's not worth the money."
5,Excellent Technical Reference,"This is a must read for anyone using Solaris and Unix, not just DB2 for Solaris. The first half of the book focuses on DB2 for Solaris, and the second half dives deep into Solaris internals and principles. Much of the information documented here is difficult to find anywhere and is highly recommended for anyone who wants to know how key aspects of a Unix operating system ticks. I particularly like sections like ""Life and Times of a Load Instruction"", ""Memory Map and Address Space"", and ""Simple/Advanced Network Debugging"". An excellent reference worthy of being on the same shelf as Richard Stevens' Unix classics!"
3,You get what you pay for,The battery was not as good as the original canon battery. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Replacement battery at the fraction of the cost.,"Everyone else's review swayed me towards this battery as a backup for my Canon SX200. Used it on a trip to Australia and although it did not last as long as the OEM battery, it did its job of keeping the camera going when the other one needed charging. Using this battery in rotation with another should be fine for most users. If you take a lot of pictures or use the flash alot, you may want to have 2 of these as your backup and always charge them up once your low battery indicator light starts to flash. Not a bad product for the price. Also, the longer you keep this battery on the charger, the longer a life it seems to have (up to 2 days max- after that, it is pretty much topped off). Can be re-charged in your OEM Canon battery charger."
5,Use as equivalent to Canon NB-5L,This battery looks and works just like the Canon battery that came with my new Canon PowerShot SX200IS. Highly recommend the battery back up for use on vacations.
3,"The first one was a dud, the replacement is working fine.","The first Lenmar battery shipped would not take a charge in the charger -- it always showed fully charged -- and it would not power up the camera.I tried contacting Lenmar's on-line customer service regarding the situation, but received no response.Thankfully, Amazon's return policy worked flawlessly. Amazon shipped a new Lenmar battery immediately upon my reporting the problem. The new Lenmar battery works fine."
1,Won't Charge,"The battery worked great for the first few months I had it. Last week I noticed when I put the battery into the charger, the charge indicator light was red, but after a few minutes, the charge light was green. However, when I put the battery into the camera, the camera indicated that the battery needed to be changed. It looks like a couple other people have had similar problems. There's a 3 year warranty on this battery, so I emailed Lenmar to ask if I could get a replacement. Lenmar responded quickly, providing me with a return authorization number and detailed information on their warranty policy. However, since my battery was purchased more than 90 days ago, there's a $7.50 shipping and handling charge for the new battery. Since I only paid $12 for the battery itself, I didn't think it was worth the trouble to get a replacement, especially since I could run into the same problem with the replacement. Anyway, I think it'd be wise to spend the extra bucks for the Canon battery."
1,Dud,"Received this a while back, and the battery does not take a charge. shows up as full when in the charger, but doesn't hold a charge. Looks like another reviewer had the same problem, and replaced it."
2,mAh rating inaccurate,"I agree with those who wrote that the Lenmar lasts only about 1/4 as long as Canon original. I am using this in the Canon Powershot SD790 IS.I have now owned it and the Canon original for about a year and a half. The Canon is holding up well, still holding a charge and providinglong-lasting power. The Lenmar has declined in its ability to provide power. It's inexpensive, but ultimately not worth all the battery swapping."
3,Nothing like the orginal,I guess some people got lucky. I used this and it never lasted as long as the Canon. After 6 months it would barely hold a charge. My original Canon battery (3 plus years) still works like a champ. I guess you get what you pay for
2,Doesn't last that long,"I bought a Lenmar for my older Canon SD1000 some time ago, and it was mostly fine.This one, however, doesn't last half-as-long as the factory battery for my Canon SX210.So, I give it two stars for being a cheap, emergency power back-up, but DON'T rely on thisbattery as your primary source for power when you head out for a long days' shooting or you'll be left with no way to take pictures."
1,Total Waste of Time and Money,"I bought four Lenmar DLC5L batteries three months ago for my Canon SX210 digital camera. They worked at first, although they held about half the energy as my original Canon NB5L. After 3-4 charges, the Lenmars stopped holding any energy. Don't waste your time."
2,Get what you pay for,"I bought this battery for my Canon SD950 IS. It seemed to function just like any other battery and most of the reviews were good so I bought one as a backup to save money. Well now that I have had it for about a year the regular Canon battery is still going strong and this Lenmar one doesn't hold a charge. With the Canon battery, you can charge it and store it and expect to be able to use it when your primary runs out. With the Lenmar, you charge it and store it and when the time comes to put the backup battery in you find out that the thing has discharged and is basically useless. Unfortunately it seems in this case you get what you pay for. If it gets a good review and the person has only owned the battery for a couple of weeks, take it with a grain of salt..."
5,good battery,"Pretty much equivelent to the canon nb-5L battery in terms of usage. Cheaper in price, a good deal, charges just as fast, and holds power just as long."
5,Cheap but good as brand name,Bought it and used it and I see no difference between this battery and Canon's battery. Glad I paid less for it than the brand name item.
5,Works just as good for cheaper,"Never again will I pay for overpriced Canon batteries, because these ones work just as well, if not better, for a lot less money. If you need an extra battery, these are the ones to go with!"
3,Off brand not a good idea,This is not a Canon battery and I found that it does not hold a charge as long as the Canon battery that came with the camera.
1,If I Could Give It Zero Stars...,This is an inferior product that Amazon should be ashamed to carry. The only positive thing about it is that it fits into the camera and lets you take a few -- very few -- pictures with it before the camera wants it to be replaced. It is markedly inferior to the genuine Canon battery.I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Canon camera battery,"This seems to be a good product at a low price, but I haven't used it much. Carrying this as an extra battery beats carrying a charger and an plug adapter, especially since I go places which often don't have electricity."
5,"Great price, great product",Don't pay retail for the same battery. This will do the job at a lower cost with the same quality.
1,Very poor battery life.,Bought this based on some reviews here saying battery life was equal to cannon battery. Not so in my case. I don't think it lasts 25% as along. Off to buy the original.
3,battery okay but broke within 1 year,"I switch between this battery and the canon battery that came with my camera for my Canon Powershot sx200 IS. I have noticed no difference in the battery life and it is great having a backup battery for when I need to charge the other one. So far have charged/discharged the battery about 5 times, so I cannot comment on the lifespan of the battery. For the price though, it is really worth it for a backup.update: almost a year after buying this backup battery I have noticed a slight difference in the charge - it does not last as long as the canon battery, although it isn't unbearable... it will at least last until the canon battery is charged. What I do have an issue with though, is that I recently noticed that the side of the battery is split open... since I don't want to stick a broken battery into my expensive camera, I'm done with this one. I will be paying the extra 15 bucks for the canon battery this time."
3,For this price it's Ok.,"This battery it's ok while you charge the original, can help you but really the performance is poor.If you can spend more money, I recomend to buy the original."
4,Great back up battery,Why spend more for a backup battery? This one works fine as a primary battery as well.
3,You get what you paid for,I used it once and it seems the use time is much shorter than the original battery. It's good spare battery for the price you paid for.
1,Lenmar Not Compatable with Canon supplied charger,"The Lenmar battery supplied did not take a charge from the Canon battery charger CB-2LX supplied with the camera. Finding this to be the case with the battery received, I obtained permission to return it for exchange. But the second battery also did not take a charge. Digital Media Source has been very good to work with in readily accepting the exchange of the first battery and the return of the second battery."
2,Lacks case or even contact cover,This might be a great bargain but it lacks any type of camera case friendly cover for the contacts. It seems overly ready to be shorted out or filled with debris. Spend a couple of bucks more and be sure your battery has not been fried when you are ready to use it.edited 24 Nov: Tried the battery. After 15 shots with the Canon SD870 it shows about 1/2 of a charge. AVOID this item.
3,Not the same as the Cannon battery,"If you need a back up battery for a cheap price, this one works. It does not last nearly as long as the Cannon battery between charges. Using the Cannon sd870is wide angle camera, I could get about 80 pictures from this battery at the highest quality setting. The Cannon battery gave me in excess of 250 similar pictures before recharging."
1,Does not hold much charge,"Doesn't hold charge as long as the Canon battery that came with the camera. After full charge, I got about 50 pictures. Loses charge quick.Don't be so cheap (like I was): buy the Canon version. I wish I did..."
1,Not usable with SD800 IS,I fully charged the battery before trying it out in my Canon SD800 IS. At first it seemed fine -- camera turned on and snapped a pic. However after about 3 shots (within a few minutes) the camera displayed a low battery indicator. I do not recommend getting this battery for this camera.
1,Doesn't work for SD880IS,"Dont buy it. For me, worked just once. Then recharged it and when tried again just keep receving a ""Change the battery pack"" message. I have tried a lot of Internet procedures, but this just doesnt work"
2,Regular,The life of this batery is too short. Sometimes it take only 25 pictures and needs recharge.
2,Half the price half the charge,"I was initially impressed by the positive reviews of the battery, but when I finally tried it out I was crying on the inside. When compared with the original Canon battery, I realized that I couldn't get nearly as many photos as I could with the canon. This was very prevalent when I use the flash."
1,Compatibility problem with Canon SD870 IS,"I recently bought 3 of these batteries believing that they were truly equivalent to Canon's NB-5L for my Canon SD870 IS camera. All of the 3 batteries exhibit the same symptom: Even right after being fully charged, it will cause a ""Change battery pack"" message on the camera. After re-inserting the battery, the message will go away. This has not happened to my Canon NB-5L battery, just these Lenmar batteries. Another problem: they don't last as long as the Canon battery."
1,doesn't work anymore,"I got this battery for less than 3 month. Charge for no more than 10 times. Now it doesn't charge anymore. I can charge another battery with the charger, which proof the charger is ok. Very disappointed."
1,Battery dead on arrival and no help from manufacturer,"I purchased the Lenmar DLC5L as a non-OEM battery for my Canon SD870 IS camera. When it arrived I placed it in my Canon charger and it showed a full charge. Well, ok, I thought, they charged it for me! I then placed it in my camera, but the camera wouldn't turn on. The original Canon battery works just fine in the charger and camera. I tried contacting Lenmar, but there was no answer and I received no return e-mail from the website. So I'm out $10 and hope other folks can learn from this as well. Save yourself the time, money, and headache and stay clear of Lenmar!"
1,Useless,"I bought two of these to go with my new camera. One holds absolutely no charge, and the other lasts maybe 1/3 as long as the original Cannon battery. Nice price, but no value."
2,Touchy controls,"I really wanted to like this game, but I won't be spending much time with it. Maybe if I had a Nintendo ds to control it with it would be OK, but with the Wii it is impossible to play some of the games, such as Pasta Letters, up to speed. I might try it with my 9-year-old, because words at her level might be short enough to be doable. I also have a niggling thought that some of the iPod apps might be just as good for vocabulary development, and be more accessible."
3,Educational,"I keeping hearing that this is better on DSi but I don't have one, so I can only talk about the Wii version of this game. Overall, the game is okay. I wouldn't describe it as fun however. Educational, yes. Fun, not so much. There are several game options and a Word Coach to encourage you. I think the disc I have is slightly disfunctional though because my coach will tell me I did well, when I completly screwed up. Using the Wii remote is a little challenging in some of the games, like the Cereal game, because it's difficult to get the letters exactly where you want them all the time (quickly that is). If you already have a large vocabulary then maybe it's not for you, but if you're looking to learn new words then, why not. There are three good things about the game: the learning potential of it all, that you can track your progress and that you can set it up for your age."
4,my opinion of my word coach game,This is a fun game to play with 6 different training games and 2 games to play for fun. Also has a few multiplayer games. In the spelling be game it is sometimes hard to understand the word that is said so it is hard to spell it right. Overall worth the price.
3,smarter as you go,Only problem with this gamesome time you can spell the word and the game will mark it as wrong other wize it is a desent game.
4,expand your vocabulary,"This is a great way to brush up on your vocabulary. And also learn lots of new words that you never knew. The interface of the game is very engaging and some of the games are very entertaining. It's great that there's lots of games to play solo, as well as with a friend. This game is great for all ages."
5,SUPERTIGHT!!!!!!!,"I'v only heard two songs and it was OFF THE HINGES!!!!! ""I know I've Been Changed"" is very intense and it gets me pumped up about our Lord Savior Jesus Christ. Down in Lafayette, La. the wonderful saints of Z106.3 hipped me on this great piece of work. I've been trying to buy this CD for a while now. Lashun I love your voice, it just push and pounds the word of GOD in my heart."
5,Excellent for beginners,"Has everything to get one started !! Tones for tuning the guitar, from the cd !! Songs to play !! A lot in this small package !!"
3,Overshadowed by technique,"There is no doubt that Lara St. John demonstrated her incredible talent and violin genius in this album. In doing so however, the improvs to show technique in some instances overshadowed the melody. Some portions of the famous traditional Occhi Chornye (Dark Eyes) were barely recognizable. If you would like to be impressed by violin virtuoso technique, this is the album for you. If you'd like to enjoy piano and violin gypsy combo however, I recommend Sergei Trofanov's ""Gypsy Passion"". Start with Tzigane Russe and I guarantee you'll hear piano and violin techniques which are awesome and yet, maintain the integrity of the composition for the true Gypsy violin lovers. _Raoul Watson"
3,Meh !,"There's no disputing that Ms. St. John is a superb technician on her instrument, but the playing here is too stylized -- far too much portamento for my taste.It's as if she thought the recipe called for a bulb of garlic instead of a clove."
4,Wonderful second try,"Beautiful, creative, and well put-together. Lara St. John is daring enough to take a piece and make it sound like an improvisation. Her expression is right on, not holding anything back. The Carman fantasy is a bit overdone, but forgivably. Once you're past that, things are very fine. The Czardas Caprice is especially great. Unfortunately, she couldn't have made a bigger fool of herself on the cover if she had dressed like Yenta the matchmaker. Would have done much better to use one of the inside pictures on the front. Too bad Ilan Rechtman can't play quite up to her speed. But throw out the jacket and you've got a great gypsy/slavic album."
2,Disappointing,Not what I thought it would be according the the jacket. Very limp and not a gypsy verve that would attend with a CD title like that
4,New Ground for Old Tracks,"I have long been fascinated by mention of the ""Old Federal Road."" I have even seen historic markers on Alabama roadways. But, until I stumbled across this slim volume, I found it difficult to find more than just a few lines written here and there about the Old Federal Road, its origin, development, route, and practical utilization ... its almost-mystical experience, at once brutal and romantic. This telling of the road's history and relatively short but important life should stand as a ""must read"" for anyone with particular interest in the American Colonial-to-West migration, Native American removal, and/or Alabama state history. This is as good as any 'snapshot' of life on the Alabama frontier in the early history of the state. The text is smoothly written. Several nice maps are included, too (although I wish these were a bit larger)."
1,damaged goods,The product was received damaged. In the box along with the product was the Email from the previous customer who had returned the product with the explanation of why it was returned!
4,Great book for those new to timeshare sales,"In all fairness, Im not sure anybook can help a person be an amazing timeshare sales rep. After all, its timeshare sales. The people walking in are there for the free gifts. Lets not kid ourselves. Until the developers get rid of the annual fees, Im not sure the market will ever be that hot. The book was great though. It really walks you through the nuances of timeshare sales and the psychology behind them. However, I can read all the books in the world about archery, but how often do you think I will actually hit the bullseye? Good luck with your selling."
1,Bogus,All of the above reviews are obviously bogus. The author is hyping the book. The secret to selling timeshares is to snag more than your quota of dummies.
5,Best Book on Timeshare Sales!!!!!!!,This is one on the most helpful books I've ever read on the subject of timeshare sales. So thankful to have found it and worth every penny of the investment. Add it to your library today!!!!!
3,If you have a multi-processor system...beware!!!,"When I bought this card, I thought it was a great to have a single card with both USB 2.0 and Firewire connections. Then reality set in when I found that this card does NOT work if you have a dual processor system. I found no mention of it on Adaptec's web site or on the box. It is only mentioned in a README file. You can only have USB 1.1 and Firewire working. If you try to install the driver for USB 2.0 support, you will get the dreaded blue screen :(I sent an email to tech. support and they said the company doesn't have any plans on fixing it."
3,Problem With Old Dells,"I bought this b/c I just purchased an iPod. I have a Dell Dimension XPS T500 (yr 2000 w/XP) that only has USB 1 ports.After about a day of trying to install, the Dell would not recognize this card. I called Dell and was told motherboard does not accept USB 2/Firewire cards. Totally false.I purchased a seperate USB2 card and Firewire and they both run with no problems.This card probably works with new computers, but be careful if you have an older model."
5,flawless installation,"I was a bit nervous about buying this card after reading some of the reviews published here on Amazon, but I did anyway--I wanted to upgrade my computer's USB jacks, and I wanted firewire for the convenience of using that with my iPod.At any rate, my fears went unrealized. Installation under Windows XP went without a hitch: the thing was ready to go five minutes after I opened the box. I can't say I've tried it under different operating systems, but under XP, it's a dream."
3,"Installation problematic, but great for what it is","As did several of the others who have reviewed this product, I had trouble getting it to work. It allocates a bunch of IRQs and apparently didn't appreciate sharing a case with my video card. I called Adaptec support, spoke with a helpful technical support guy, and after hanging up made a relatively easy bios change that made everything work fine.Because USB2 and Firewire cards separately cost about as much as this card and would end up taking two slots I think that if you're comfortable possibly having to troubleshoot installation problems it's well worth it."
3,"Excellent toy designs, however some plans are incomplete.","This book features some excellent designs for construction vehicles that will both satisfy the woodworker and the lucky child that receives the toys. With some disappointment, however, the plans are incomplete, missing various critical views and dimensions, making the toys that much more difficult to reproduce. The alternative is to be creative and ""guess"" at the dimensions or, purchase full size plans advertised in the back of the book."
1,Not at all good.,Please don't buy this. It damages the ear. It has some additional noise we have to hear always. It irritates your ear.
3,hear amp,"It has a little of an echo that you get use to, its works for the money. The piece tends to fall out od your ear a lot because its not long enough and the pieces are to big. The batteries don't last long. Theres a rechargeable whisper for a little more money and its worth it! If i were you get that instead."
2,You get what you pay for I guess,"This thing is large and gaudy- not to mention it doesn't match the picture. It's got giant writing on the side proclaiming what it is and the name ""brand"" if you will (which you conveniently cannot see in the picture of the product here on Amazon). Not exactly something that should be loudly advertised. I should have sprung for the extra $20 the first time around and got something a little nicer. Perhaps if I purchased this for the intended purpose, which in this case is obviously stalking Bambi with a rifle, then I wouldn't mind. It would be the least of Bambi's concerns, right? But alas... my intent was to improve my hearing ability in a much more urban environment. So I'm cheap and it bit me in the tail.Honestly I have no idea how well the item works because I was so horrified by the appearance I didn't want to take the time to pry open the indestructible plastic package."
1,do not buy! this is a rip off!,"this item does not look like what it is pictured. the ear bud that holds the plastic interchangable earpiece is way too big to even fit where it should go. its so big you cant even get the piece to hear from inside your ear so its basically unusable. the piece that is pictured to clip onto the ear is not there. it will not stay on your ear and it is in no way adjustable. this item i a huge rip off. i will never recommend this to any one and i am extremely dissapointed that i cant even get my full money back for this product. i am not wealthy and this was a good bit of hard earned money that i just spent on something i cant use. i am highly dissapointed about this!!!!! do not waste your money on this.!!! i would recommend ""Walker Ultra Ear Hearing Enhancer, Bte-Ue1001"" this i have bought and is so much better."
3,Woodland Whisper,It's alright. Doesn't stay in the ear very well even with the size variants. Cheap enough and fast enough delivery though.
1,not what we ordered,"According to the item pictured on the package and on the screen when we placed out order. The item we got is not what was pictured. The one on the package has a extra piece , you can see on the enchaner the tube is thicker at the top coming down to the ear, to help hold it on the ear, it is missing on the enchace we received and it will not stay on the ear."
3,Nature Vision hearing aid,I bought this product for my grand father and he really loved it. Very reasonale price and really helpfull.
1,Woodland Whisper behind the Ear enhancer,"Save your money, very cheaply made, which for the price probably can't complain. I bought this to encourage my granddaughter to wear hers, well it doesn't fit behind the ear and stay in place and very uncomfortable, as for hearing, it is like hearing an echo from the bottom of a tin can."
4,American perspective on an Irish war from the front lines,"I loved this book. It was a very interesting story of an American journalist who placed himself on the front line of the conflict in Belfast. While attempting to blend in, he finds himself being questioned by both sides of the ""peace wall."" He even has an interesting run-in with the IRA. This book is a good read as well as very informative."
2,not impressed,I tried this primer and am not impressed. My shadow creased faster than without it. It is also very light colored. I did dust powder over the primer.
1,Don't Bother to Buy this One,"This is a waste it holds a few cards they give you and some figures and not much more, we brought ours back to the store.It is not a game, just an expensive holder for the figures."
4,I love it!,"Alright, I'm twelve, but I'm a big fan of the card game and I liked to play with the small guys and pretend they were prisoners(sometimes). I agree with my sister Woodsfairy that it kept me organised and saved the toys from getting lost and my sister from stubbed toes."
1,?Satanistic? - I don't think so!,"I'm a 35 year old mother of two, ages 6 and 7, and I watch Yugi every afternoon and Saturday with my kids and love it almost more than they do. While I agree that Yugi is nothing like Pokemon, I disagree with the statement that it is satanistic. I'm sorry, but I don't see that this show has any 'satanistic' or 'devil worshipping' connotation at all. It does show extreme good, extreme evil and all the grades in between, but isn't that what real life holds? Personally I love how they strongly reinforce friendship and truth to oneself and others. I do NOT see any more 'satanism' here than is in the bible. If you do, perhaps you need to sit down and read your bible again.As far as this game goes, it is not a very good buy and really just an expensive storage case IF you have the right figurines."
1,Disappointing,"The holographic cards are not holographic. There are no instructions. My son wanted this as his ""only"" birthday present and is so disappointed."
1,Demonicy!,Yu-Gi-Oh is satanic and imitates people summoning demons and using witchcraft. I would not recommend this for ANYBODY.
4,Great organizer and fun when used with imagination!,"My 6 year old son owns approximately 50 little figurines. I purchased the arena as an organizer and it was worth every penny. All 50 figurines would have been lost if not for the arena. In addition to holding figurines, it can be turned upside down to resemble the dueling field on the tv shows. My son uses a lot of imagination and duels with his figurines using the arena and a lot of sound effects. I have stuffed all of the figurines in it and still manage to close it, and it has not fallen apart yet. We have had it since it was first released ... My son takes it to friends houses to play and it is a favorite to all."
2,My son doesn't touch it!,"My son loves Yu-Gi-Oh, and cannot be pulled away from the TV show or his cards. But he has hardly touched the arena play set. Some of it, admittedly, is that no one else has it. But it just is not a necessary component of the game. The cards are portable, the arena is not. I wouldn't bother with getting it."
2,Very Disappointed. No instructions,The idea is great but there's no instructions in how to play the game. The cards don't have any information about their defense or attack abilities. You have to figure our a way to play the game.
2,lame-e-oh,"This was pretty weak, but it is Yugi so my son wanted it. He has played with it a total of 15 minutes since we got it 2 weeks ago. the cards do not fit in the case, and it only comes with 2 characters. And the others from the store do not fit in case either."
1,BIG WASTE OF MONEY,"My husband and I were under the usumption that this was a platform to be used with the game, but were we fooled. It is the biggest waste of money I have ever seen. It is only used for carrying and storing figures. So if you are fooled to believe that this is a game save your money. My son and I duel all the time and he often has friends over to duel, but the WASTE has never been used."
4,Ahmadiyya,"One of the comments prompted me to investigate further after which I found out that the author Abdul Mannan Omar had passed away on the 28th of July 2006 (96 years old) as his obituary appeared on The Light, a London-based Lahore Ahmadiyya community monthly publication. Hence the interpretation that Jesus died of natural death as had been proclaimed by the founder of this movement in 1891, where he claimed to have received revelation from God about the death of Jesus.While the other entries are remarkably accurate as the references that he used were very much authoritative of the Arabic language, his opinion, creed and interpretation of the Quranic verses will raise a flag within the mainstream Muslim community.If I can give Edward Lane a 5 star for his voluminous Arabic Lexicon, I should be able to give Mr Omar similar rating for his work. I don't subscribe to his faith."
1,Selected and Controlled,This is a selection of words a certain group wish for you to use when translating the Qur'an. I recommend you use a more comprehensive set of lexicons and do your own work when selecting the words. This book was a waste of money for me.
4,Good but not perfect,"The organization of the translated words and the overall structure of the dictionary is good, but could be better. Sometimes it is difficult to find what you are looking for and it also is not as complete as I would have liked to see. I recommend Lane's Lexicon for a thorough listing of Arabic words used in the Qur'an (And just the Arabic language in general)."
1,"Totally Misleading , Muslims Beware","Mr.Omar has apprently been suffering from some kind of serious Insomnia or mental delusions or hallucinating ! His view or personal opinions are very misleading and does not represent true islam, I was rather shocked to know that Jesus died a natural death as totally opposite to what a muslim belives and other misleading opinions like the age of Adam or the father of Abraham etc. Mr.Omar failed to provide any sources for his conclusions and even if he did, it really did not mention how?? Any body seriously intrested in looking for a dictionary should probably find an alternative. I mean how can I accept Mr. omar meanings when I dont agree to his views???"
1,Over priceing of merchandise.,"Yes indeed, bought this item cost me with shipping over $30.00, ---also bought the same item, made in thesame country, Mexico, at Lowes for $9.95. guess where I will be buying from now on."
1,Worthless,"The entire contents of this book can be easily found with one google search. All in all, it's a completely worthless purchase."
2,Computer won't read mini-disks,"One of the beauties of this camera is that the mini-disk can be taken out and played directly on your DVD player. You'd think that the same would be true of your computer. Wouldn't it make sense to be able to take the mini-disk out of the camera and then be able to call up the still photos you took and be able to email them or print them? Can't do it. You have to get special software disk called ""Picture Package"" ($70!) that they don't tell you is not compatable with Windows XP editions with Service Pack 2, which most Windows users have. When you install the software, it freezes your computer or worse and the tech support acts like you are the only victim in the world. It's a real scam."
4,Pretty good,"Pretty good for fun, not too much educational though, but my kids love the doodlebops, specially the jokes about ""knock knock who's there"" game."
2,New Kids on the Block meets the Teletubbies,"My kids can watch this for about ten minutes before they wander off & lose interest. It's so commercial & fakey that it doesn't hold them. The characters don't really play their instruments and all the music and singing is canned so they can lipsynch to it (pretty badly). My kids go more for artists who actually play the instruments and don't rely on kitschy costumes & over-done choreography. They much prefer the Laurie Berkner Band or They Might Be Giants. Oh, well. It beats a lot of the other tripe that's out there for kids."
4,What I want is Normal after all?,"This book provides the comfort of knowing what other men want in women and what other women want in men. It might help single people searching for someone who is ready, willing and able to love in return. For married men, it reveals why your wife is so disappointed and frustrated, and offers hope at satisfying the needs she can't and won't express. Best of all it could help men and women express and explain their unmet needs, so that lovers have a better chance to meet those needs."
3,Main Flow is trying....,"The album right away when you look at the track list, has a bunch of well known artists ie. Raekwon, Black Thought, Planet Asia, Killah Priest...you get the picture. What Brick Records is trying to do though is get you to see all these names so they can push Main Flow. Well...it worked for me to but the cd but...the cd itself didn't really do it for me. I mean Main Flow is a sick MC and he kills it on Doom (Mood) and Hi-Tek's Hiteknology but...it floped on this one. Igive it three stars mainly for the lyricism...the beats are WACK!"
4,"Superb photography, excellent informative & witty prose.","This excellent coffee table book focuses on 60 of Americas classic automobiles from the 40's through to the 70's. Full colour, large photos of all angles of the cars chosen to represent their ilk are supplemented by other examples in the models history. Thoroughly recommended."
3,Hydrotherapy,I'm physicaltherapist and I'll like to know more about hydrotherapy. please give me more sugestions about this term. thanks
4,Thorough and Balanced,"I sometimes get nervous delving into medium length books on a specific or narrow historical subject matter. They quite often are essentially extended articles that have been padded to book length. This is not the case here. There is an effective balance of exposition and detail.Also the book is more balanced than the title may imply. Any reasonable person would have to admit that the ""election"" of Hayes was bogus but this book is a fair assessment of the deeds and misdeeds on both sides. I came away with a expanded veiw of both Hayes and Tilden as well as the ins and outs of this very messy era."
2,Misses the main points of the Election.,"The book is too obvious in it's ""Southern"" approach. Sounds like what the Democrats of the South were saying then in 1876. A good historian is a TRUTHFUL one. That looks at the evidence and writes it down truthfully. Being a student of any secion of history, you have to read all sides. I read Fredrick Douglas, Ida B. Wells, who wrote a essay on the New Orleans Massacre. WEB Dubois also wrote alot about it.I'm sure they would shake their heads at this ""Revisionist History"". A new book out that does a good job is by Douglas Blackmon ""Slavery by Another Name."" Everyone should read other writers of this time and compare. This comes up short.I gave 2 stars for the effort of writing the book."
4,Who stole what.,"A classic case of a grand theft. But who really stole what. One party cheats the electorate in the states of Oregon, Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana. The other party disenfranchises millions of former slaves in these states and the other 10 Southern states. Morris does a great job detailing the crimes of the board of election in the three states. He spends less time in detailing how a newly liberated people had their votes taken away. All that said, this is a great read on how the election was pushed away from the statistical winner (Sam Tilden). Both Hayes and Tilden were ethical men, it was their party people who were the decievers.I like this book and believe that it is a great story. However it only tells part of the story."
4,Good Stuff,"I read this book, and found myself drawn to the author. A bright, talented kid, doing extremely dangerous things, in the spirit of getting the story. I was struck, most, by her honesty. She portrays her life, warts and all, and doesn't apologive for the person she is.I passed this book on to a friend, who raved about it, and passed it on to her step daughter. This is a book about women, for women, and for guys willing to see world events from another perspective."
2,Our book club agreed....,"general concensus was that we didn't care for it. ""Shutterbabe"" was a bit whiny - she was offered an incredible opportunity at a young age, obviously she grew up in a family with money, and never seemed to show the appreciation for what was given her, based on the choices she made. Some parts were funny - but we do wonder what her husband and children will think of down the road when they read her exploits with other men."
3,Shutterslut,"This is the story of shutterslut. Shutterslut sleeps around a lot. That's how she gets her assignments, and how she gets ahead in her ""career"". Her four years in the business of photojournalism consist of nailing every photographer she can find, whether they are in a relationship or not. But beware if one of them kisses his actual girlfriend in her presence: then she feels soooo betrayed, (talk about double standards and hypocrisy). If this is feminism, the world can do without it."
2,over rated,Well I must agree with those 1 star reviews. This woman seemed to be on a personal sex quest and brags about it. How boring. Her pictures lack emotion as well. Too bad a woman couldn't bring more light to this subject other than to tell us how many times she was raped. Please...get real.
4,Good Quick Read,"This book was a quick good read, written from the heart. The woman boasts about her exciting life, which was at moments inspiring, but hard to believe. I've discussed the book with other educated well-traveled women in my book club, and there were a few who just absolutely could not stand the woman, and thought of her as an air-head. I didn't apreciate her afterword about 9/11. I thought it was absolute nonesense, and made me doubt that she has actually learned anything from her experiences abroad.I would recommend this book to young women in or right out of college. Adventure is right around the corner! Entertaining."
4,A Young Woman's Search for Adventure -- And Herself,"I am not quite sure how to describe this book. It is about photograhy in the sense that a young woman from a suburb of Washington, DC goes off to Paris to pursue a career in photojournalism. Kogan wants excitement and finds herself making photos of wars and meeting a variety of men. In time she finds what is important to her and that is the most worthwhile part of her story. The references to Leica and Nikon equipment are enjoyable and right on the mark for those who enjoy photography. This is not grand literature but it provides insights into finding oneself and what it is like to be a novice photojournalist."
2,"Read the reviews, trust your gut...","This one let me down. There's a credibility issue that I can't completely explain. And...well...the real story here is one of a young woman's encounters with men and the bric-a-brac that goes into it. At times I found myself offended that war was used as a backdrop for what seemed like a psueudo-erotic fieldtrip abroad. The connection between the author and the tragedy of war, the cultures and histories involved...well, it isn't there, or, if it is, then it did not resonate with me. Instead I was reading a story where being a ""photojournalist"" comes across as being a cool and engaging cover for tramping through distant corners of the world. But even getting that much out of the book, after finishing it I can't say I understand why she chose to write it."
2,"Great beginning, but loses steam","I know the book is about finding one's self, but the convoluted, twisted story structure gets old. I rarely stop reading books until the end, but this one I just had to put down. The beginning of the book started out great. Then about mid-way I got sick of reading about the author's sexual conquests. I certainly hope that this book is not a true reflection of the lifestyle of a young photojournalist.If you want to read it, save your money and go to the library or buy it used."
2,The soul of a emotionally unavailable man in a woman's body.,"I really wanted to like this book, afterall I'm a photographer with no extra cash and I plopped down full price for the hardcover. Yet even with my free spirited tendancies, I have to admit I have a problem with a memoir where most of the chapter headings are named after the author's casual sexual conquests. I know she's trying to be a guy. She admits that freely. Still, she's supposedly a serious photographer yet there are only a handful of pictures in the book, and even those are mediocre. So what's the point? What's the message to other young women trying to find their way with a camera? And how did she make the drastic change from obsessive adventurer to stay-at-home mom? Yes, the book is self-referrential and narcissistic yet there is little believable emotional exploration here. Maybe taking baby portraits will suit her better. Maybe then she will grow a heart and soul and have something important to say."
4,"If it wasn't non-fiction, you wouldn't believe it.","Deborah Copaken Kogan has led a remarkable life already. Like a real-life Lara Croft, she is an amazingly tough and resilient person. She wins points for the feminist movement through action and achievement, not rhetoric, since she endures things that most men I know would not dare face. Parts of this book are shocking enough that they will rip you out of your comfortable Lay-Z-Boy. Beware though, you will probably be jealous of Deborah's life if you have any sense of adventure."
2,so short of its potential,"This book had unbelievable potential and ended up falling flat (and occasionally offensive) on so many levels. The biggest problem is immediately obvious... the author gives each chapter a title corresponding to the man she is interacting with at that time, as opposed to highlighting the corner of the world/piece of history she is exposed to. She consistently appears more driven by her current relationships than her incredible position as witness to world events and the extremes of human lives. For someone to have the amazing experiences she did to have proven as shallow as she seemed time and again was truly depressing. I felt she could have been such a champion for strong women (could even gone with her sexual ""liberation"" in that spirit) but I had no respect for her at all at any point in the book, other than her incredible dedication to her children at the end."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,Poorly written.By page 34 you have heard about 19 sexual encounters (although without any redeeming detail). Remember the Wilt Chamberlain book or the Geraldo Rivera (Jerry Rivers) book that were basically about putting notches on belts? This book is the same but written with even less skill.I would be much more interested in a book by her husband and how he could possibly want to spend the rest of his life with a woman who had casual sex with the frequency of a bad ham radio.Unless of course many or most of the stories are untrue...
4,More exciting than enlightening,"Shutterbabe is a quick and easy read. The prose is light and crisp--just right for those marathon sessions when you want to burn through a book in a day and a half. With considerable doses of bullets, blood and sex, 'Shutterbabe' is more exciting than enlightening. A page turner as Kogan relives her fast-paced life as a globe-trotting photojournalist and recommended for 20-somethings struggling to make the right early-career choices."
5,compelling read for photo adventurers,i was given this book from a curreny gamma photographer who said that it was ok. i read it with the expectation that i would find fault with it. i found myself drawn to it to finish it within three days. i can see this book as a required read for photojournalist students.
2,Shutterbrat: Adventures in Casual Sex and Self Importance,"The quality of the writing is poor. There is nothing extraordinary about the authors adventures. Spending a couple of weeks with Afghan rebels does not constitute war coverage. The title implies that the author experienced war. It certainly wasn't in Afghanistan, France, Switzerland or Zimbabwe or Potomac, Maryland. Maybe there was actual combat in Romania or Delaware. I stopped in the middle of the chapter about one of her sexual conquests in Bucharest."
4,A woman travels the world to take pictures and have sex.,"Although Shutterbabe is worth reading, I can't help wishing the author stuck to her journalistic adventures and not her personal life, which after a chapter or two became tedious. DCK had some amazing experiences - her descriptions of the Romanian orphanage and how she felt while photographing the horror were written clearly and with honesty. Still, I wish she had added a bit more context. Her lovers get more copy than her photo assignments!"
2,Shudder Babe,"Proof, once again, that no one should be allowed to write an autobiography before the age of 65."
4,Testament: A Soldier's Story of the Civil War,"Of the many books published on the Civil War, ""Testament"" rises above the others. From the first chapter on, the reader is transported back in time and place. The uniqueness of presenting this story using the the diary of a soldier is simply spellbinding. The words from this soldier's diary are intricately woven with narrative so descript and vivid one can truly understand all that a war encompasses. The emotion that pours from the pages is overpowering. The soldier's sense of duty and honor countered by his fear of war's consequences is conveyed so realistically, the reader can not help but feel the internal conflict of morality just as he did. Beautifully written and timeless in nature, this book is a must read for civil war buffs - and - for anyone wanting an understanding of the horrors of war."
3,Interesting and disappointing,"While the letters are quite interesting, they constitute a very small part of the book, the bulk of which is a very traditional narrative of the Civil War. I was expecting something more focused on the original documents - so I was disappointed to realize that little of this book is original testimony. The item description makes it clear that there is more than the letters in the book, but I was not expecting the letters' material to constitute so little of it. So beware - if you are looking for a solid (but by no means original) narrative of the Civil War, buttressed by limited, but interesting material from a private's letters, this is for you. But if you are looking mostly for first hand testimony, you might be disappointed, as I was."
3,Saddar Bazaar - 'Conference Of The Birds' (Delerium) 3 1/2 stars,"Hard-to-find, out-of-print obscure UK psychedelic band. Think they have one other CD out there somewhere. Best track of this entire CD is the tripping ""Garden Of Essence"", hands down. Other notable cuts include ""Sukoon"", ""Arc Of Ascent II"" and the tasty ""Freedom Rider"". Line-up: Matthew Hyder-guitar&kubing, Shawn Hyder-sitar&percussion, Dave Spencer-tablas&percussion and Terry Banx-keyboards. Might appeal to fans of Zuvuya, Electric Orange and Sons Of Selina."
4,"Easy, Quick Installation, Video Software is OK","Installation was a snap. Installed the card, fired up my Windows 2000 machine, and there it was. No drivers to install, Windows took care of it. No drivers to install for my video camera (Sharp Digital Viewcam). Once I plugged in my camera, Windows 2000 loaded the default Microsoft DV driver, and that worked great. MGI VideoWave 4 SE software that comes with product could be a little better; (more effects, more video formats, etc) but overall, very good product. Total time to install product/software: 10 minutes. I run a Pentium II 350, with 196 MB RAM. It took about 45 minutes for the software to convert a 9 minute AVI file to MPEG. I recommend having as much memory and processor speed as you can have."
1,Does not recognize my sony camcorder,"I purchased this card based on the positive reviews here. However, my sony camcoder (TRV20) was not detected. I'm seeking technical support now. After I get their reply I will update this review. I use Windows XP pro.Although this is a good card (according to reviews), it may not work for certain camcorders."
3,So far so good,"I can't rate the product any higher yet as I am waiting for a DVD burner to use it, but I must have gotten a different package than the other reviewers. The CD with mine has NO drivers-not that you need one, the plug and play works fine-but the disc has only the myDVD editor, Acrobat, and Quicktime on it-no drivers. The real negative with this is that when the hardware installs, it installs as a Texas Instrument product and driver and the directions specifically tell you to look for the ""AFW host controller"" in the device manager list which is no where to be found-not in windows or on the CD. Not that it is unusual for directions to be misleading. Going to the Adaptec website there is a support FAQ that explains that sure enough the Texas Instrument info will show up and that is OK. It would be nice if there was more attention paid to getting the instruction sheets right."
2,"Card is okay, software worthless","I really wanted to give this one star, but that's not really fair to the board, which works fine. The videowave software is extremely limited and doesn't even allow you do do much of what is in the manual. For instance, there are modules to allow adjustment of color and brightness, but they are disabled. So all you can do is look at them. Customer service requires an ID number which is not provided with this version. So the only way you can get help is to pay for phone support. I'm so turned off by this I will likely avoid all Roxio software in the future.Bottom line, buy the board if that is what you want, but don't even think about using the software."
5,Flawless - follow the instructions for pure joy,Got this for my new iPod. Both have been an absolute pleasure. This was simple to install and use. No issues at all!
2,FireConnect 4300 causes PC not to boot,"Installed OK and worked for a few days, then PC (Dell Dimension 4400, Windows XP Pro) wouldn't boot anymore. Removed FireConnect 4300 and PC was fine. Will have to return this card as incompatible."
2,"......,. product",it worked for two days before braking on me and now my computer doesnt recognize my ipod or aknowledge its there
1,Doesn't work with my PC,"I installed the board and my PC (running XP Pro) won't boot. I tested all the PCI slots with other cards (and mixed them up too) and the PC boots fine. I returned the card and got a new one. Same problem. I removed all of my other PCI cards and left this one in there alone ... same problem. I'm speechless. I guess it's not compatable with some systems. By the way, I know my set-up is fine. I have 3 PCI slots filled and 3 additional USB devices and all is well. I never had a problem like this before."
1,wrong item,I ordered 3M and got Scotch instead.I found the Scotch to apply unevenly withbubbly splotches intermittently.Not pleased.
4,BUY THIS CD!,"If you love Weezer's first 2 albums, then get this CD by Ozma. It's really, really fantastic."
3,tired of geek...,"The thing about Ozma is that they are really great musicians and really mediocre lyricists. At first, just about every song on the album was very catchy and easy to listen to, and the same held true for the double donkey disc (which i dont think is available on amazon yet). Eventually though, I got fed up with the songs about nintendo games and trading cards and decided that the lyrics were just intentional ""geek rock"" and did not display any kind of originality, which is a shame because the music is really very good besides that. Geek has become a very specific style, and the only reason I could think of to buy the next album is if it were instrumental, or if Ozma finally decided not to be restricted by the simple genre they helped invent."
3,A Meaningful Film,"This is another good film from Little Beth Entertainment, and also is one of my favorites so far. ""To See the Moon in the Morning Sky"" really makes the audience wonder what that does mean. But after seeing the film, though there was a wanting for music, you see what that means for Ricky and his family in this. Like other films from Little Beth Entertainment it sends a great message and is a good family film. It tells some of the same struggles that some of us have. ""To See the Moon in the Morning Sky"" is a unique, meaningful film that i think families and other viewers can enjoy."
3,Somewhat helpful,"Although I liked this book, I already knew most of the information that it contained. I was somewhat disappointed that the book did not have many specific recommendations for hair loss products, i.e.: dosages, amounts, application procedures. The book also spent way too much time discussing hair transplants which are not an alternative for most women due to diffuse hair loss and unstable donor sites. The book gives far too few doctor recommendation and once again, the doctors recommended were mostly hair transplant specialist. If you are a beginner to female hair loss, you will probably find this book helpful as it does contain good basic information. I, myself, was disappointed."
2,Don't buy it new !,"Ladies this book has some useful information, however most of the information is only helpful for those who have done little research.This could be a good starting reference book. I did find a few things out I did not know and went to a few websites I had not considered. So for the used book price this book is worth the money.Did you know that hair loss is one of the first signs of diabetes, and I wish this book had touched on this fact ( copyright on this book is 2000). I however, have not seen really any information other than on diabetes' websites that informs you of this and they have been updated.He does give more possibilities than other books that were copyright dates of 2005 for natural supplements and diet. I can find hair restoration anywhere and don't think that should be so deeply covered in a book of hair loss. It should have dove deeper into diet, diabetes, and other causes.I found the bald truth to be better than this book, it is by the same author."
3,Professional renditions?,"Before I say anything else, I'll have you know that I only bought this CD for one track, Wherever You Will Go. And I was highly disappointed. For one thing, the instrumentals don't sound at all like the original. It even sounds acoustic, for goodness' sakes! And the backup signer was no better. He did not sound one thing like Alex Band, nor did he even sound like he could sing a note. The other tracks were okay renditions, but nothing ever came near the originals."
3,It is a special CD format,"It was my folt, I don't read it well (i guess), you need a special machine to play it"
3,party cd,This karaoke party CD is good but the last track would not play. Also very mature content . Not intended for children.
1,UNRELIABLE,I purchased these Shoe Covers as a gift but for some reason the Qty kept defaulting to 2 although I only needed 1. I've changed the Qty back to 1 two different times but after adding another item to my order and back paging to re check something I didn't notice AGAIN that it defaulted to Qty: 2. This order was placed around 2 or 3 in the morning and I called Amazon about an hour later to advise what transpired. They gave me the Merchants telephone number (e-mail wasn't available for this Merchant/Seller) and I immediately called them and left a message. This Merchant/Seller did not respond to my voicemail nor did they honor my request of changing the Qty back to 1. This Merchant/Seller had ample enough notice but of course they went ahead and shipped 2 sets. To date I have still not received a call nor an e-mail in response. I will NOT purchase from this Merchant/Seller again and I am a frequent purchaser w/Amazon.com and various Merchants/Sellers via Amazon!
1,large and gaudy,"I have a very thin wrist and had not realized that the face of the watch is a large as it is. I also did not like the black mess band as well as the silver mesh or linked bands. I did however, like the mother of pearl face on this watch. I would have returned it but, I needed a watch until my other was repaired. I would not recommend this watch. Normally Skagen watches are very attractive. I would buy a Skagen again, in fact, I purchsed two after this one."
5,excellent,"the 3rd album of BBR.Actually these songs are BSides and there is only 1 new song,which is Jackie Sixty. And 2 wonderful remixes. Usually i hate remixes of any band,but these are so cool,i mean remixes are usually pop/techno/dance things but these are not,they are like indie type.I suggest you should get England Made Me before this."
5,As close to being there as you can get...,"An authentic, engrossing account of a life lived in a difficult profession. From his humble beginnings as a new pilot (all helicopter pilots start out humble, the machine won't let you begin any other way), Fleming walks you through the early events that shaped his character, and would stand him in good stead as he embarked upon a life of calculated risk taking. There are two rescues in the book that will literally have you on the edge of your seat, one as a young pilot and another as a seasoned pro. I don't recall reading anything that comes close in authentically describing how man and machine can literally fly into into the face of peril, to save the life of a stranger. Heroic acts are not always spontaneously undertaken by unlikely people, some individuals spend their lives risking their own safety for others. Fleming truly deserves the title Hero."
5,Campfire and Battlefield,"The Civil War was the most important conflict the U.S. has ever been involved in, bar none. The military, ethical, and governmental consequences have been enormous. Campfire & Battlefield gives us a unique perspective of this great event."
4,If you need the help,"This book has been really helpful for me in my writing classes because it's small, easy to pack, and is full of easy-to-find information about how to write."
2,Poor Customer Service,"This book was allegedly sent, but was never received. Either it was lost or misdelivered. I complained to the vendor and the vendor put the burden on me to investigate through the post office. The vendor never bothered to resend the book and take up the case of delivery with the post office. This is an example of poor customer service and business practice."
3,Basic writing skills,"The book contains BASIC writing skills for college. Don't buy it, unless you think your writing skills are weak. It was required for my class and I didn't use it once."
2,Ok,"Book was not as it was described, they taped over the teacher part. Should have had a better description. Delivered with in the time line.Thanks,Deb"
4,Awesome...,"A great follow up to Blinding Bright, which I thought wandered a bit. The new instrumentation really works for these guys, Quick's vocals and lyrics are gorgeous, and I can't wait to hear what these guys come up with next. If anyone deserves to hit, it's this band."
2,Poor reserve power,Nice looking-well made-but only has 7 hours of reserve. First watch had 4 hours reserve time-replacement had only 7 hours. Has to be put on a watch winder daily. Thought a Swiss ETA would have at least 12 hours reserve.No more Invicta automatics for me.
2,poor time keeper,"I own quite a few Invictas. I have three with the SW-200 movement other than the 9938. Two are Invicta Reserve watches and one is the 4469. All keep exceptional time, so I was surprised when after purchasing the 9938 I found it was gaining a whopping five minutes a day in time. For a watch that costs this much that is unacceptable. I can use it for a formal watch, but that still does not excuse this lapse in qaulity control when it comes to a 26 jewel Swiss made movement. Beautiful product, but if it can't compete with the cheaper Japanese 21 jewel movement, than I would recommend purchasing the 88xx series and saving a whole lot of money!"
4,Invicta 9938 pro diver,Working very good so far. I only had this watch for about a week and a half. if it continues to work the way it is then it is very good. Looks great and was delivered on time.
3,Invicta 9938 Checked Out,"Invicta Men's 9938 Pro Diver Collection Automatic Diver 23k Gold Plated WatchMy Invecta 9938 Pro Diver is spot-on for accuracy and seems to stay wound up for ages. I take it off at night and put it on again after a day at work and its still ticking away.The band is solid and heavy but held together with none-stainless steel pins that leak rust stains and so the watch would benefit enormously from the introduction of stainless steel screws. Even the pins that hold the band on the case turned rusty.The bezel ratchet mechanism is very tight and solid, clicking 120 times per revolution whilst lining-up correctly with the second markers.For those wanting a lookalike Rolex, Invecta have ensured that this watch will fool no one by placing their mark on the watch at every opportunity including etching their name deeply into the case side in large lettering."
5,Dreaming Wide Awake,"I am very impressed with this release. This artist is new to me so I had no preconceived ideas of what to expect. Her voice is very smooth, womanly strong. She brings me back to the days of my youth when I was hearing more black women sing of more than the blues, songs of inspiration and happiness, black women voices were heard in a more positive way.I really enjoy listening to this CD."
4,Im Hooked,"I got turned on to Lizz yesterday by a friend. It goes with me everywhere. I can't get enough. I read the reviews on Salt and it seems that most prefer Salt over Dreaming Wide Awake. If thats the case, I need them both. Im HOOKED on Trouble. She seems to come alive in this song. Can't wait to hear more. Chris"
5,Flavor for my Soul,"Lizz Wright definitely speaks her mind through her music. And you get it when she sings and her music sounds great. Her voice is absolutely unmatchable and irreplaceable. There are artist and then there are great artist. When you can come up wih a song that sounds good because of it's beat, then that's ok, but when you can sing a song, write it, whatever, just as long as your fans understand what you're singing about. It speaks to you and takes your mind off of so much stress. I like this CD a lot and I do hope that people will buy it, not just because it sounds good, but because of the message behind this music."
4,"great, unexpected though","I was expecting more of the same from her first release when a mutual friend informed me that Wright doesn't want to be pigeon-holed as a jazz singer. What's wrong with that? I thought.Nevertheless, the album is wonderful and original - which is, i suppose the goal here. She's still one of the greatest to come around in a long time."
3,Great Voice Blah Album,"Lizz Wright has a magnificent voice, which she uses to great effect. Unfortunately, on this album she has chosen a collection of songs that are mainly arranged as ballads or slowed-down versions of faster songs, and the entire album sounds the same after awhile. It becomes boring and monotonous to listen to the same level, same energy, throughout. And some of the songs are not even up to the standard of her beautiful voice. Lizz Wright reminds me a bit of k.d. lang, who also has a fabulous voice but not the world's best taste when it comes to choosing music for her albums. If you want something to play in the background that won't offend anybody, this is a very nice, peaceful record. If only it had more of a groove! Next time, I recommend that Lizz consult with some tasteful musicians and producers to steer her toward more diverse repertoire and more variety in the arrangements. Given her talent and beauty, she could easily top the charts with the right music."
2,Just wasn't feeling it,"I think ""Salt"" had more compelling tunes and showed Lizz hada great range vocally and stylistically. I barely got through""Dreaming Wide Awake"" twice because those elements aresomewhat missing this time. It's has a more subtle vibe. Whichis cool. Different strokes for different folks but I'll stickwith ""Salt."""
3,Glad to meet Lizz,"Smooth, soothing voice covering some familiar songs with a bit of a different twist. Lizz didn't offer the vocal dexterity of Julie Fordham or the ""upfront"" sound of Norah Jones. Possibly a little more mellow than expected. Looking forward to hearing more her."
5,"I, for one, like it","I don't get all of the reviews stating that Lizz Wright ""sold out"" with this album. The album doesn't sound much different from her first one, Salt. It may sound a little Cassandra Wilson-like, but it's still a good album. And for those saying it sounds too much like Norah Jones, that's because her Jones' co-writer, Jesse Harris, helps out here as well. I think ""Get Together"" shows how versatile she is and I love her own penned track, ""Trouble"". The neo-soul field was too overcrowded as it was and I'm glad that Lizz is expanding her horizons."
5,Cream,"I'm stunned. Speechless. Just when you think, ""what's new in the world,"" LIZZ! I could go on forever and ever."
5,Warm and deep voice,"Makes me miss winter, with a hot cup in my hand, near a fireplace with all the rain and cold outside and warmth within..."
3,more jazz would be great,i listened to her live in istanbul...great voice..but i wish she sings more jazzy...she would be marvellous and soo tasty with standardscheers everyone
3,Gorgeous Voice but Disappointing Arrangements,"Lizz Wright has a gorgeous, powerful, yet soothing voice. In live concerts, she is both poised and warm. After her beautiful debut album, Salt, I eagerly anticipated her second release. I was disappointed, and sorry to say so. The orchestration is, like another reviewer said, like Cassandra Wilson. And the country tinged tone of some of the songs is like Nora Jones. Neither bring out the true beauty in her. The arrangements are done without piano, but with guitar and slide guitar. It does not work for her. After I listed to the CD, I played a song she recorded with Joe Sample, a bluesy, jazzy piece. You could tell the difference in her voice. It soared. I hope she will go back to using a piano in her next album and to being herself -- whether it is gospel, or soul or jazz. This album did not work for me. I love her voice and think she is an incredible talent. But she needs to find a producer and arranger that brings out her strengths."
2,CASSANDRA WILSON? OH NO ITS LIZZ WRIGHT,"As soon as I saw that this released was Produced by Craig Street I was worried, but I loved the first cd Salt by Lizz so I had it sent to AUstralia anyway ALAS my concerns were justifed. He has taken the same approach to every Cassandra Wilson cd (which after a few release all sounded the same) that he produced and done the same on Liz...Such a waste this womans voice is pure gold however on this it just sounds uninspired dull and plain boring...if u like very laid back counrty folk music you just might like it , otherwise keep listening to SALT.. This will be one of those cds that sits on the shelf and collects dust."
4,She's getting more appealing.,"I only recently ""discovered"" Lizz Wright as a result of an Amazon recommendation. I bought the CD's in the reverse order of their release, Orchard, Dreaming Wide Awake, then Salt. Orchard is outstanding! The music is varied and interesting and accompanied beautifully. Dreaming Wide Awake is not as good, but shows growing sophistication and maturity. Salt (is this too politically incorrect?) is too ethnic-sounding for my taste. I cannot wait for the next CD. What a voice! What control! What emotion!"
5,"It's intimate , Honey !!","When I close my eyes , I feel she's confessing to me only and it makes me dreaming wide awake! Lizz Wright makes you feel at home with her world of deep feelings. A great performance from a true singer..."
5,A Dramatic Tale of Romance and Adventure,You will love Francine. She is a trip. The hero despaires of all the scrapes she gets herself into and falls in love in the process. It is very touching how she helps her sister and brother in-law's marriage. She also plays a part in circumventing danger to the brother in-law. I have read it at least twice and look froward to reading it again.
4,My new bookcase,"I am very pleased with the bookcae - nice quality, excellent appearance an we were able to put it togerther with little difficulty."
2,Not great if you have a wireless NIC.,"This doesn't work so hot if you have a wireless network card.Every time that anything accesses the USB port, it causes somuch interference that it drops the wireless network connection.Plus, the supporting software is really pretty buggy.I'm bringing this one back to the store."
2,Not great,"First of all, this has to go in the top PC slot, because it is bulky.Second, I couldnt get it to work with my notebook (running ME). The lights stayed red.Most importantly, and the reason I didnt pursue trying to get it to work for too long, as a previous review said, the card interfered with my wireless connection. My wireless nic card below the usb adapter couldnt hold a signal, even without the usb card working.So, I returned it, needless to say."
1,Doesn't work with flash drives. Avoid this one.,"Because this card DOES NOT come with a power adapter (the Belkin Cardbus card does, and I'm ordering one after I send this one back) it would not work with my flash drives. One it would not see at all, and the other it would see but not access.I assume it works O.K. with low or non power devices such as USB keyboards or Mice, or with devices that have their own power supply such as an External USB hard drive, but I've tested neither. I just know this one is 15 dollars more, then you need to turn around and buy the adapter, which is not even listed on Amazon?Also, the driver installation was a pain because after Windows XP installs its drivers, you have to disable all the USB controllers on the card, download the Adaptec driver, then it will install the Adapted drivers. That took me about an hour to find on the Adaptec website. I'm a technician and I do this kind of thing all day; it should not be this hard.Avoid this one."
2,Needs power supply...that nobody carries,"This card is fine for what it is, but it is basically useless for many high-speed applications. If you want USB 2.0, it's probably to feed a thumb disk or a hard drive or a video adaptor...all of which will need the USB port to feed power.Which this card does not. Unless you plug in the ""optional"" power supply. Which is not available off the shelf in most stores. Sure, I was able to fashion one myself, but why should I have to? This 95-cent omission on Adaptec's side is a $15 problem on top of the purchase price."
1,This is a loser - doesn't recognize USB memory key,"My limit is 2 hours to get a driver + new hardware installed. After two hours I wasn't even close. I got it to drive a mouse, but what I really needed was to be able to connect a memory stick. Never happened. Don't buy this one. Look elsewhere."
3,windsock,I was somewhat disappointed with this. It was sewn crooked and did not look as pictured. I am going to do a little altering and use it. Still a good buy for the size.
3,I LIKE COGNATES !,ALPHABETICAL TOPIC LISTING IS VERY HELPFUL. I like to learn Spanish words as fast as possible and so do my students. Every week I use 10 cognates from this book as a quiz. It's fun to hear some of the guesses that are made. This book is a good and quick vocabulary builder.
5,Man this is good!,"Ok, I ordered this record because I stumbled across the singers site and read a lot about his voice lessons and all. I therefore took a chance and ordered this...BAM! This albums is truly soooo good! I really love hardcore but specially the old-school influenced stuff and this is really great. I like bands who try to pass a message (personnal stories are good but there's just something that appeals to me more when bands get socio-political), this guy could write great lyrics and his band members could write some awesome sounding songs... this record instantly became a favourite and will easily pass the test of time with me...BUY it! It's too bad the band isn't anymore but they left some great stuff to be remembered for..."
5,This cd is wonderful !,Rudolph Stanfield did it again. I have enjoyed his work over the years and as always his music is full of praise and worship. This cd will encourage and help you to praise God.It is truly a wonderful worship experience.....
5,This CD Will Truely Bless You,"My number 1 song is ""Better"" is excellent, I don't know the young lady who sings the song but she was brillent, my 2nd choice was ""When God Say's Yes"" Ms. Vanessa Bell Armstrong put her flavor in this song, this is the old Vanessa that I'm use of hearing. Mr Stanfield has done it again. I have had the pleasure of working with him in Baton Rouge, La. Mr Stanfield keep up the good work. God Bless You"
2,Sad but true,"Come on guys, I'm sorry you aren't selling albums any more, but this lame attempt at generating revenue by doing a Metallica ""tribute"" album just leaves me sad. I'm a huge fan of Metallica and many of the groups whose members perform on this album, but this is not a good product. In almost all cases the singer is the week point. Check out Unforgiven, good guitars, lousy vocals. Even John Oliva, the voice of Savatage, does a poor job. I wonder why they didn't let Lemmy sing on Nothing Else Matters? Most of these remakes lack any personality. The shining exception is the Jake E. Lee and Chuck Billy rendition of Seek and Destroy. Not Metallica's best tune, but this cover at least has that recognizable Jake E. Lee style (ala Ultimate Sin). Buy it to keep them from starving, but I don't see it going on anyone's ""Most Played"" list."
3,Um not bad...,"To be honest, this album is not bad but... For people who wants to get know various songs of Metallica and/or to distinguish who has played, it seems to be rather valuable. Besides the above, you can realize that Jake E. Lee is comparatively shining player on those songs."
3,"The Muppets, Vincent Price and Alice Cooper:Whatta Show!","I saw this episode when it originally aired in the states. Although Vincent Price does appear, the real guest for this one was Alice Cooper. Setting aside the shock-effect of his concerts, Alice and crew went for truly monster-laughs. Using Alice's ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" to set the mood, Jim Henson and company had the perfect opportunity to go wild with the camp-scare monsters. This must be the most fun episode of the Muppet Show ever done. Alice Cooper fans have been tracking this one down wherever possible. When it's available again, don't miss it! (PS: Save a CASE for me)"
3,It's just okay,pretty tiresome and could use more plot and circumstance. I rate it as just okay and no more than that.
1,It was very bad acting to many pauses with out any talking,"This movie is not worth the money, it had very bad acting and to many pauses with out any talking"
1,Fun? Not in this case,"Low budget amatourish attempt to create ""a film"". I kept asking myself what kind of fun is mentioned in the title...Because the motion picture is not funny at all. I wish I could write it's at least interesting :(Unfortunately, I cannot as there is no plot. Yep, no storyline. And it drags for more than 80 minutes.Loss of time and money."
1,No Fun Down There,"Hmmmmmmmm... I don't know. I did not enjoy the movie at all. I understand it was a low budget movie, but don't see that much creativity in this film. Story line was nothing. Or I should say there is no story line at all.The plot and reason why he has to leave his hometown was very stupid. I just don't know what to say...."
4,"""must-have"" for nursing students","When I was in nursing school, I found this very helpful to have in my pocket while at clinical or in my backpack for quick reference. I liked the product so much I gifted two friends with their own when they began their nursing program."
4,Harrowing,"This book provides an insightful, objective and detailed account of aspects of the Vietnam war not seen in most of the war movies and mainstream media. Through stories of bravery and sacrifice shown by US soldiers and vietnamese soldiers/citizens, we get a glipmse of the complex art and horror of war from those who experienced it in those dark tight places under the earth."
4,Dominate a Vietnam Tunnels category on Jeopardy!!!!,"Haven't you always wanted to know about the tunnel fighters of Vietnam. If so, this book is for you. This book provides fascinating insight into the tunnel system of Vietnam and how it ultimatley undid the Americans. Did you know the Vietnamese had tunnels directly leading into a major American Base? This book shows you both sides of the tunnel situation during the Vietnam War. A must read for the Vietnam War Buff!"
5,Gripping unbiased account of the Vietnam conflict,"Having read a number of books on the war in Vietnam I was eager to read 'The Tunnels of Cu Chi' when a friend recommended it. I was completely absorbed by the book and could not put it down. The author does a fantastic job presenting the reader with an unbiased account of both the American and Vietnamese experience in the tunnels of Vietnam. I learned a great deal about the life of a Viet Cong guerilla, and why they proved to be such an elusive and destructive adversary."
5,Underground Warfare in Nam!,"Underground Warfare in Nam!""The Tunnels of Cu Chi"" by Tom Mangold is exciting account of the underground tunnel war in Vietnam is readable, balanced, and accurate. The authors use firsthand accounts from participants on all sides who fought over and used the tunnel networks of the Cu Chi district near Saigon."
5,The books great... but the film is fantastic,"5 years ago, BBC 2 ran Mickey Grant's ""The Cu Chi Tunnels"", and I found it to be the best film about Vietnam. As the previous reviewer stated, it's not just a companion to the book, but rather a statement about who the Vietnamese people are. Buy the book, but also get the tape!"
4,The Tunnels Of Cu Chi was insanly interesting.,"The Tunnels Of Cu Chi was an very interesting book. It's incredibly informative and tells about the forgotten part of the war. The brave young men risking their lives by going down into the tunnels only to face the darkness of fear deserve such a well written book. I recomend it not just to inform, but also to inspire."
4,A good read,"This is a very educational book on the Vietnam war - a topic most people have at best a fuzzy understanding of. The American tunnel rats were incredibly brave (and at least a tad crazy), fighting against the clever and dedicated Viet Cong enemy on their own turf - actually, under their turf, in tunnels rigged with booby traps and other dangers. I learned a lot about the war with perspectives from both sides of the conflict."
5,"Whoa, this is awesome!","This is a great book! The ending is nothing like you'd expect it to be. I thought it was an exciting book, a real page-turner. In this book, the students at Parkside Middle School are losing their talents, and nobody can figure out why. One minute, the students are talented... and the next, they completely lose everything that makes them special! And it's all up to Amy to figure out why. I'm not going to tell how the students lose their talents, because that would give away the ending. But all I'm going to say is that once you read the first chapter, you definitely won't want to stop."
5,No Talent!,"In this book, Amy and Tasha try to make friends with outsiders, Tasha with Michelle, and Amy with Chris. Then everybody at school starts losing their talent! The star quarterback cant throw, the track star cant run and the basketball star cant shoot! This wasnt one of my favorite books in the Replica series but in my opinion it was still good"
4,GOODY,"This was one of my favorites, it has an interesting plot. But i gave it a 4 because what does ""missing peices"" have anything to do with the pplot?????"
3,What??????????,"Okay,Amy males a deal with tasha:They should try to meet new people,so that's how the problem started....they try to make friends with dorky Jerry Newman,who is obbsessed with ""Mega-man""comics.....Well,they also try to make friends with Michlle Brooks,a 7th grader who is intressted with writing for the Parkside School Paper(Otherwise known asthe ""Snooze"")....Well,People suddenly start to lose the talents that make them speicial,Like the star of the football team suddenly can't throw a ball,The best sprinter is now slow as molasses,and more......Michlle is convinced that a Demon is taking everyones talents away,and she blames a new student(who Amy has a Crush on),and she goes around school saying that he's a demon!Well,this is starting to get out of hand,and with the talent show coming up,what if by then all the talent is gone?What if what's happening to everyone happens??????????"
4,"Kinda strange, but cool!","This was a pretty good book. I tried to give it four and a half stars, but I couldn't figure out how.I liked most of it, but the kid stealing people's talents just 'cause he was an underdog was kind of lame. I've read worse, but still, not the best idea. I can't believe the reason Eric dumped Amy for. That was pathetic. I don't think he would have done that to Amy. But I do like her new boyfriend, Chris, better than Eric. That's what saved this book from a poor rating. I wish Amy'd tell him what's up with her though . . ."
1,"Missing Pieces(Replica, 17)","I thought this was the worst book in the series!!!!Why would Eric care if Amy isn't in High School!And what is up with Chris??? I like Eric way more than chris, Chris is sooooo crepy. And how on earth could a bracelet do anything? I think that Jerry has got some big problems!!!!!!!!!"
1,Nightmare product,"Lots of problems with this product. Frameitall is garbage--Don't Buy!Problems: 1. All timbers have stickers that are difficult to remove and that leave a sticky mess on the product. 2. Caps will not fit securely on all hinges giving product a junky look and weakening structure. 3. Screws that hold the hinges to the timbers strip the composite plastic and will fall out. 4. Cost--something this flawed that also has high shipping charges will leave you angry and frustrated. If you are trying to buy something to look good and last in your yard for a playground enclosure or landscaping look elsewhere. If you are trying to waste money on a cheaply constucted and expensive product, frameitall is the way to go for you."
2,Cheaper to buy kits with free shipping,"I like the Frame-it-All raised bed kits, and have had six 4' x 8' x 18"" beds in use for a year, without problem. (See my separate review of kits, stacking joints and anchor joints.) I considered buying some of these boards to use with left-over stacking joints that I replaced with anchor joints when I set up the first six beds, but it turned out to be more economical to buy kits due to this seller's shipping charge of $11.55 per board. The 4' x 8' x 12"" kit comes with twelve boards plus twelve stacking joints for a delivered cost of about $50 less than the delivered cost of twelve boards from this vendor. So I'll just give the excess joints to friends who prefer to build wooden beds."
3,Very Good,"I bought this car for my 2 year old nephew. I thought it was a little bit smaller than it was. He absolutely loved it. the only problem we had with it was there is a disk that gets inserted into the front of the car which gets ejected when a button is pressed. Every time my nephew tried to insert the disk, he would push it in just a bit too far and the disk would jam. We would then have to use a butter knife to get it out. It's a great car, but definitely should be used with children a bit older who are aware not to push the disk in too far."
2,the shooter is terrible,"The batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a boy who adores batman. But this same boy gets extremely frustrated trying to shoot the coin shaped projectile that it comes with. You have to insert it ""just-so"" to get it to shoot when you press the button and my son doesn't always do it, then I have to get a butter knife and pry it out so I can put it in for him. For 10 dollars it's worth it, so long as your child doesn't absolutely want a shooting batmobile.PS. My sister bought the same one for her son this Christmas and is having the same problem, so I do not think it is unique to mine."
5,Great Divider,What can I say? They do their job well. They divide my pages so they are easier to find.
4,Nice,"I paid $1.33 for a package, they take a little time to setup on word, a little tedious to tear and slide into place but for the price they're a good value."
3,okay if in good lighting,"I bought these dividers to separate categories in my 2"" coupon binder. I've had them for about a month now, and I use the binder a few times a week. The pages are starting to tear around the holes, even with the (thin) plastic reinforcement. Also, it can be hard to see the text in the blue tabs if you're not in a bright environment. If I was making this purchase again, I'd do with clear tabs."
5,Love Petra,I grew up listening to this music.Brings back good memories.Listen to it in my car on long trips to other states.
5,CD,This was a graduation gift request from a nephew. It arrived in perfect condition and my nephew was thrilled with it--he had been trying to find this particular CD for quite some time.
1,A fairy tale,"Political correctness, personal responsibility, and fake patriotism. These are the themes of Glenn Beck's book. Beck is a Bush apologist with a hyper sense of new age spirituality. He is pretty funny in an adolescent way and some things he says make sense. But, the subtle and not so subtle references to his right-wing ideology slithers up your spine as you read this book."
1,Rhetorical Masterbation,"This is a book for the right-wing who are firmly set in their ideological ways. Close-minded folks like these see the world in black and white. ""You're either with us or agaisnt us,"" or ""you're either liberal or conservative."" This leads to their simple-minded or retarded view of the world. As an Australian, I am fortunate to have an outsiders view but, this excessive stupidity on America's conservative groups is mind boggling. It's like a permanent race of buffoons with fascist tendencies.For those who like Glenn Beck, Grow up. There is no such thing as santa claus and George W. Bush stole the election from Al Gore."
1,A junkie's tale,Glenn Beck is a junkie just like his hero Rush Limbaugh. Only redeeming quality that Glenn has is that he knows that he's a right-wing cheerleader.This book is a junkie's manifesto. A simpleton's view on life. Instead of writing...Beck should have put more pics of his fine wife in the book.Other than that...the book was great. Syke!
1,Bush Apologist,"The sad truth is that the Conservative ""movement"" in America is a loose conglomeration of radicals who would prefer to conform to corporate whims than to thoughtfully redefine America's place in the world. I've read Glenn Beck's work and can say that he is a funny man, certainly capable of making a compelling argument. That's why it's sad he sinks to the level of demagogue in 'The Real America.' Did Glenn really need to waste so much paper when the message of the book can be boiled down to ""Republicans good, Liberals bad""? If anything, the book is proof that liberals are winning the cultural wars, and that conservatives are increasingly viewed as mealy mouthed ... capable only of bending over to big business."
5,Delivered as promised.,Product was received the the shape that it was promised and in a timely fashion.
2,Fairly lightweight and a bit confusing,"I enjoy Glenn Beck, his show and his message for the most part. But I found this book a little confusing. After a few pages, you get the impression that Beck is a humble and sometimes self-deprecating guy. Yet, he includes a bunch of photos of himself (some with famous people) that really don't have much to do with the book. It smacks of name-dropping.A lot of the book comes across as being lightweight fluff (especially the ""chapter"" on partisan politics) - why even have a chapter if you're just going to fill it with ""blah blah blah blah."" Beck oversimplifies some things, and this is probably the worst example. I think he would have done better to make his point in a more intelligent fashion, at least in this instance.On the other hand, not all is lost here. He spins a few heartwarming tales, but there simply aren't enough of these moments to offset the weaker bits.Borrow this one from the library like I did."
5,Let's ALL Read This Book to Become REAL Americans,"Great book. I just started reading it today, and I'm already on page 110. I can't put it down. I just keep shouting out, ""Amen, Brother!"", and can't wait to read what's next.I agree with Mr. Beck, that if we all agreed to become the Real Americans that are described in this book, America and the world would be a better place."
1,Horible book!,I cannot come up with enough adjectives to negatively describe this book. It stinks to high heaven.
1,Save your money,This book is almost as bad as his radio show. Save your money to send to a charity. He wrote this book in 3 days and it reads like he wrote it in 2 days. Good luck with this 4th grade read.
1,Very Bad book,"This is a poorly written book, which is why it fell off of the best seller list. His writing is elementar. If the font wasn't so big, and it was spaced so big, it would only be about 30 pages long. I cannot recommend this book. If you want to read it just go to your local book store, buy a coffee and sit for about 30-45 mins a read it."
5,My review...,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.....Quagmire, quagmire, quagmire, quagmire, quagmire, quagmire, quagmire...Weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep...Did someone say creamy chocolate sugar butter?"
5,Gotcher bedwettin' liberal whinin' R-I-I-I-I-I-IGHT here!!!,"I laughed, I cried. I laughed till I cried, I cried till I coughed. I coughed till I puked. I puked till, oh, I don't know, at least 3:30 am. Then I laughed again - no, wait - let's see, laughed/cried/coughed/puked... or was it puked then coughed???? No matter - Glenn's book is a 5 Star tour-de-force of bodily functions.One more thing, before my head explodes - if I read one more (serious) review from some idiot expressing their disgust at Glenn's ""tactics"" for trying to sell his book, or that I should go to a local animal shelter so I'll realize killing dogs isn't a joke, I'm gonna.... ARRRRRGHHH!!! Quick, pass the duct tape!!!!!!!!!!Anyway, as an avid listener who never misses a minute of any of Glenn's broadcasts, I can honestly say, ""Who the hell is BoBo???"""
5,"Whiny liberals leave, we know you can't read anyway!!!","Well, the whiny liberals are at it again! They somehow think that we believe they would actually *buy* a book by a conservative talks show host, then *read* the whole book, and then *write* a fair review. Yeah, right! If you are a liberal this book will piss you off to no end because it describes the REAL America that is hidden under all your emotional, socialist, and P.C. crap. This book is a must-read for every American who is concerened about their freedom and desires to live a clean, real life."
5,Does Amazon censor these reviews?,"What Glenn Beck represents is free speech on non-pc topics like:-Why are pols looking away from illegal immigration that is destroying our country (or not - make your argument)-the use of charges of racism as a war against white people in the USetc.OK - I posted a critique on Amazon of a pc book about Islam that portrayed Islam as a misunderstood, peace-loving religion, as I remember. My review was pulled after a few days due to back-room censoring.What an eye-opener!Anyway, what I am saying is that Beck and his ilk are our white knights tilting at a fortress of leftist schemes carried out by the schools, the demonrats, the media, and yes, the republocrats.Now we sit and neither Bush nor the demoncats say or do anything about our borders, our poor, our loss of jobs, the collapse of our economy.Go Beck! Lets get ugly!"
1,Hrumph....,"If a man is willing to take an innocent life just because his book didn't make the Amazon bestseller list on time, then he must be the lowest human being that has ever been created. Of course, this begs the question if God really created him or not. But, I digress. I might have taken a look at his book before...but definitely not now....and, realistically, he should lose his job and be banned from all radio stations...and maybe even sent to jail or fined. But, since we live in the times we do in this country, I highly doubt that is going to happen. And, by the way, I am not a liberal."
1,Posted for Brittney from San Diego,Brittney's ISP is down so she asked me to post the following haiku as her review.Glenn you dog-killing pigPig pig pig pig pigPig pig pig pigA haiku from Brittney from San Diego
2,Unpleasant sales tactics,I was listening to this radio show today and I was shocked to hear how Glenn was trying to increase the sales of his book. He threatened to kill a puppy (Bobo) if the book didn't make it in the top 10 at Amazon! How could a serious author do this? I really wanted to read this book but now I have serious reservations about the sanity of the author!
1,WARNING: This Review May Be Trying To Brainwash You.....,"Glenn Beck's illogical, narrow-minded viewpoint was consulted while killing an unprecedented amount of trees. What a waste of trees."
1,Not very good,"I bought this book thinking that it would be good because of some of the good reviews, but, I was wrong and so were the reviews. This book is a juvenile attempt to sugarcoat reality. As a 38 year old woman, I wanted something that would offer a more realistic, smarter and more rational perspective of the the problems that ail our country. Sadly, this book is written for 6th graders who should not have to deal with the difficult issues that face us all as adults."
1,fear,Drive the heard in the direction you want with fear. Joseph Goebbels knew and used this very well.
1,Designed for stupid people,"This book is full of sentimental appeals to authority; along with reckless disregard for evidence, complicated ideas, policies and organizations.A simpleton's view of the world. Glenn's target audience are mentally defective automatons who like their news serve on an idealogical platter."
5,Prediction,"This book, if it's anything like Glenn's inspiring monologues about the True America...will be great!!! It will certainly top the best seller list just from Glenn's listeners alone. Read this book and recall what America was, still is and can be for you!!"
5,Proud to be AMERICAN,"Proud to be American is right. Why he waves the flag, hmmm... let me think, let me think. Unlike that Bush-Bashin- ""MAN"" this guy is PROUD to be American. Deal with that you UN-AMERICANISTS! ( F.Y.I Michael Moore) Be Proud! I totslly agree with this guy! He is proud of where he is from and goes by it repecyfully and does nothing more than express his view points on life, LIBERTY and all the good stuff. He puts that Michael Moore WUSS to shame with his RESPECTFUL, NON-INTROSIVE way. ASs long as you stay RESPECTFUL, by all means, speak your mind. That is one thing thing GREAT about AMERICA, you CAN do that. RESPECTFUL is what Mr. Beck STAYED is RESPECTFUL. I don't here any RSPECTFUL commentary from that UN-rightfully Oscar-winning Directer as of Mr. Moore. Hr. Beck is ABOVE that slime Michael, simply for remaining respectful."
5,A Must Read,"If you are annoyed at political correctness and the way our society is going, you will enjoy and appreciate Glenn Beck's ""The Real America"". I have read every book written about our country and politics and moral behavior that has come out in the last ten years. Glenn Beck's is one of the best. And to be honest, I think the book that is a combination of the most unusual and most educational that you should go on to read after Glenn Beck's book, a book that is about ""the real America"" and the way it was supposed to be and ought to be, is Norman Thomas Remick's ""West Point: Character Leadership...Thomas Jefferson"". It is complimentary with Glenn Beck's ""The Real America"", and, like Glenn Beck's, is also on my list of the best and most honest books."
1,NARCISSISTIC,"Glenn Beck is so filled with hubris that it borders on narcissism. He are intellectually devoid of anything worthwhile. However, that is not what is most the most pathetic about it. It is his constant misleading of the sheep of America who, like lemmings buy this so called book he have. I feel anyone who purchases this book, filled with his idiotic thoughts, must have potatoes in their skulls for brains."
1,All I wanted was a damned review,All I wanted was a review on this book before I spend my money. These reviews suck!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for all the Bull S&#T.
1,Insanely Stupid,This is literary porn. I don't understand how anyone can give this book more than one star. I would have given this book negative stars if it was possible.
1,Zero Stars,This book is the exploitation of stupid people. The fake emotionalism and the appeals to pseudo patriotism. This is an attempt by Glenn beck to cash in on the war by claiming that war equals patroitism. What a quack.
1,The Conservative's answer to Miss Cleo,"Glenn Beck has a radio program and now a book. This proves that any idiot can achieve great things in this great country. Too bad that many people think this guy is entertaining. I slogged through this book with the help of painkillers. I couldn't get the ones that Rush Limbaugh got illegally from his housekeeper so, I had to settle for the over the counter kind.Those considering buying this book. BEWARE!!!!Wait for the paperback or check it out at the library because it is not worth the paper it was printed on."
1,The reincarnation of Hitler's propaganda machine,"Move over Joesph Goebbels, Glenn Beck is here to pull the wool over the eyes of Americans, just like you did with the Germans during Hitler's rein. I can't believe this guy's book was published, it reads like a kindergarden fairy tale. If you want to know about the real America, skip this book and read a newspaper."
1,Terrible book,A sign that a book isn't very good is if you can't continue reading it. This book is one of those books that will end of forever in the bargain bin.
1,Spirtual hogwash!,"New age wackiness and Republicanism have mated and produced an offspring in the name of Glenn Beck.This is a terrible book from a terrible spokeman of an ultra-nationalist movement. There is nothing wrong with loving one's country, but, to take it as far as this guy does and to equate loving one's country to blindly following one's leader, reaks to much of facism and nazi nationalism.I would reccomend Mein Kampt before I reccomend this piece of trash.If you are a conservative you would be better off reading Kevin Phillips or Tucker Carlson.Glenn Beck gives conservatives a bad name."
1,Glenn Beck is a liar,This book is a wonderful book on how to lie. Great for thugs who want to learn the art of lying.
1,"""Conservatives"" take themselves way too seriously","What is interesting is that books like this on the left are entertaining. Franken gets mileage out of being interesting and amusing as he throws his barbs. Books on the right take themselves way too seriously, this book being an example."
1,White Boy World,"This book is a white boys fantasy. In the hood, we have a different reality and the real America is nothing like what Glenn Beck describes it as. White boyz like Glenn Beck need to go out more and experience what it is really like. He instead has a worldview that is straight from a comic book."
1,Another book for the mindless,"republican party hacks who aren't interested in research or truth and just want someone to tell things like they want to believe they are.So Mr Beck joked on his show about kiling a dog to sell copies, eh? Just goes to show you that Glenn's just more of the unfunny DJ stunts and sad attempts at humor that we get from fm morning zoo crews and shock jocks nationwide.Save your money and buy #1 book on amazon, Michael Moore's 'Dude, Where's my Country.""--an author that Glen tried to tell us has no following, despite the fact that he outsells Mr Beck, Sean Hannity , and Ann Coulter by a huge margin every time."
1,BAH!!,"Since a bunch of you want to write reviews of this book without actually reading it, I decided to follow suit...This book is terrible. It looks to be written by a third grader. In fact, most of it is just blank pages with page numbers. The ""author"" simply can't write and he should be sued for selling this as a book when it's nothing but a bunch of random scribblings in crayon.There...Now, is there anyone that is not a fan of this guy that can write an HONEST review without getting all googly eyed and kissing his feet as if he were Christ reborn?Sheesh!"
1,NO JOKE,"I don't care what the Glenn Beck Fans say! Sure I have never listened to his show, but I still know that threatening to kill aonimals is not funny, it is not a joke and it has nothing to do with all of us animal-lovers out there ""finding something better to do"". As it happens most of the time I think political correctness has gone awry - but this publicity stunt has nothing to do with ""making a point"".Maybe all of you Glenn Beck fans should go to your closest ASPCA and see some of the animals that come in neglected or abused and see how you feel about the ""joke"" then."
5,A true American speaking his mind,"Mr. Beck is one of the few people who speak it how it is, no spin. He's not a bleeding heart nor does he wrap himself in the flag for the camera. I see Mr. Beck as a spokesman for the American people who want to live their lives and raise their children without having their lives polluted by violence and perversions. Read him & listen to him. His views are based in common sense and a natural desire to make everyone a neighbor, no matter where they live, how much they make, or what they look like.P.S. Mr. Beck please don't kill BoBo the dog...I bought the book!"
4,"Read the chapter ""The Enemy Within"" to understand reviews","(...).As a Glenn Beck fan I will say that the book is not worth the paper it is written on. Not because there is anything wrong with the thoughts presentend in this book, or the structuring of these thoughts. It is that Glenn Beck loves and is gifted in the medium of radio. The only way to appreciate is in the medium he was born for. The audio book is the only way to purchase this book since you get the nuances and humor the way Mr Beck intended it to be.P.S. If you actually read or listen to this book you (even Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, and the ""Stay Puff Marshmellow Man"" Micheal Moore) will enjoy what Mr Beck has to say about conservative talk radio. Lawyers will despise what Mr Beck has to say about personnal Responsibility and class action lawsuits.BE A REAL AMERICAN and listen to this audio book."
3,Cute shoes..,These are cute style and comfortable with socks. I however hoped that they would be softer feeling so I could wear them without socks. They are a structured shoe with a good support. True to size. suggest you waterproof as simple drops of water make the tan ones look dirty.
3,good,this was a good purchase to help me with ideas for adapting ready made clothing for arthritic parent. the ideas and some of the added results from experiments on ready made have lead me to believe in searching for one size larger clothing for adaptation. it saved me some cash.
3,Find a newer home networking book.,"This book was once very good but because it was written in 1999 and published in 2000. I would look elsewhere for home networking info. Many changes have taken place since this book was published -- wireless networking standards have changed, cabling requirements have changed, and operating systems have improved. My recommendation is SOHO NETWORKING, an excellent book published in 2003."
5,Sylvia Townsend Warner's masterpiece,"Townsend Warner started this novel with the intention of producing a Marxist-Leninist account of how a community of women made their living in the medieval period. That probably sounds deadly dull, but the book itself is anything but: indeed, it remains one of the most page-turning novels I've read in years. Detailing the lives of a convent through eighty years in the Middle Ages, THE CORNER THAT HELD THEM defies any simple explanation of its plot: nuns come and they leave; mothers superior replace their predecessors and then make new plans for the community (which often come to fruition and often don't); people affiliated with the community are born and then later die. Yet despite its apparent random nature, this remains one of the most engrossing books I can imagine: from its beginnings in disastrous marital infidelity to its unforgettable conclusion of desperate betrayal, it has all the fascination of real lived experience."
4,In the beginning...,Started by Rorion Gracie the UFC was put together to showcase Gracie Jiu-jitsu and its effectiveness against other styles. Brings back memories... good action but the commentary was almost comical.
4,Great classic UFC,"This is where it all began. If you want to learn the history of some of the UFC legends, this is good source. It is a bit more brutal than UFC now but it will give you a greater appreciation of what made the legends of UFC who they are."
4,Classic,"Nice collection for a reasonable price.Watching again, I now know what made that old myth about ""95% of fights going to the ground"" so popular. It was repeated a number of times by the commentators!That should be ""95% of arrests"" not fights."
2,disapointing quality,I understand that it is a mixture of different locales and events but the film quality of the majority of them is just awful. It takes away from the enjoyment of watching the competitors. Some of the scenes were blurry as well. It makes me wonder if they were amatuer filmed.
2,damaged goods,"Items were delivered on time but were damaged. Contained 4 dvds, two of which had small cracks. All 4 dvd cases were broken upon arrival and unable to hold dvds securely, had to throw them away. Product was not packed for safe shipping."
3,So Glad to have found it.,I loved this series! But it has been so difficult to find and videos of it. While this episode was not among the best episodes it was still great to watch and relive it. My Fiance was simply thrilled that I found. I never even knew she used to watch widget!? It made for a wonderful evening together relive ing childhood memories.
1,A Bit Haphazard,I thought the performance sounded somewhat anemic. I would definitely shop around before settling on this recording.
5,Bach would be impressed!,Lara St. John's performances of the Bach Works for Violin Solo would definitely impress Bach himself. Her mastery of the violin shows in her passion and beauty of her performance. A must have for any classical music listener!
1,A BLAND RECORDING,"St. John has nothing original to offer in this recording beyond an interesting cover design. Her performance sounds like a mere amalgamation of the notable performances of the past (Milstein, Grumiaux, Szeryng) but without any of the same individuality."
2,"I've heard it all, and this is nothing special.","A decent recording but one that has nothing extraordinary to offer. The tone and technique are excellent but the interpretations are pedantic and, at times, flimsy. Far surpassed in every respect by Hilary Hahn's recording of these pieces."
1,No Passion from St. John,"This violinist tends to force the music; she does not let it breathe. Phrases run into each other, and misplaced accents often interrupt their momentum. The overall performance seems a little contrived."
1,So bad you'll want to hit yourself in the face.,"Maybe not quite that bad, but at best another mediocre rendition of these works."
1,Give me a break,Do record companies really think they need to have their femaleartists appear almost naked to sell CD's? This is really poor taste.
3,Searching for German Spirit,"I confess that I was curios about the debate related to the cover photo, so I bought this recording. I liked the photographs, textbook and recording quality is also good.Lara St. John is neat, has a high-quality instrument and it is evident that she has remarkable technical skill. In the recording, partita is generally played ""fast"", hurrying to catch something (I don't know what). And in a point to hurry, Ms. St. John slows down. Generally her tempo and nuances do not follow the emotional stress in the music. In many places she focuses plain musical text, rather than Partita or Bach. I'm afraid famous ""German spirit"" is missing in Ciaccona. I absolutely do not agree with reviewers that generously praise her, and give 5 stars. In my opinion recording gets 3 over 5. (I believe it is fair in European standarts) I may try Romantic composers from Ms. St. John. She's 'good', but Partita needs more than being 'good' I guess."
4,Reviewed by Tanya Bates for C&B Books -I was inspired! Bravo!,"Shedding Light From My Journeys is an intimate look into the mind of this gifted young poetess. Powerful words of wisdom come spilling off of the pages. After each poem, the reader is left with something to think about. Frazier has given the reader encouragement, chastisement, empowerment and the strength to try again another day.Frazier speaks about this era, but the reader can tell that there has been influence from eras past. Shedding Light From My Journeys is a contemporary, yet nostalgic look at who we are as a people. This collection reminds of our past and the irony of continued mistakes in our future."
5,Very Deep,"I thoroughly enjoy the poems, particularly ""A Nu Love Space Demand"" & ""Letter to Your Proposition"". I also thought ""Out of my Queen Self"" was very deep and showed a unique literary prowess not seen in a long time."
2,Sad Indeed!,"It's ""greatest hits"" packages like this that leave many fans wondering in awe about how songs get chosen for these type of things. Sad Cafe's best moment was ""Run Home Girl"", a Hall & Oates-styled pop song with cool vocals, nice sax bits and a wailing synth/guitar solo that brought British rock and American soul together in fine fashion. MISPLACED IDEALS and FACADE were the band's two biggest albums (both for A&M) and both are on a 2-disc reissue via Renaissance which is a superb buy and complete value-for-dollar CD. This set, however, is downright SAD. It doesn't contain ""Run Home Girl"" or any of the really great songs from FACADE. It limps along with a majority of cuts from far inferior albums the band released for RCA when the vim and vinegar were long-gone. Contrary to the nice cover and the full title of this so-called ""anthology"", this isn't the set you really want of you're a fan of this fine seventies Britpop band."
2,Lacking......,"This compilation does little to give the listener an accurate picture of just how good this band was. The track selection is questionable and the sound quality is mediocre at best. As of September 2009, new import 2-fer remasters are available and all 4 albums included are really good, especially ""Fanx Ta-ra"" & ""Misplaced Ideals"". I have them on order and am anxious to hear how well they've been upgraded sonically.The ""Misplaced Ideals""/""Facades"" 2-fer on Renaissance is also a worthy buy. The sound on those CD's is quite good. (Trivia bit: The title of the ""Facades"" album is an anagram of Sad Cafe) This was a solid band with excellent songs, great harmonies and fine musicianship. I'm happy to see this stuff available again."
4,Good Sturdy and Useful,"I am very happy with the sturdiness of this item. I needed this for my husband's work coats, caps, hoodies etc - lots of weight on it. It has held up to it all. The only thing I would change is the ends of the hooks need to be rounder or with little balls on them. So far no clothing damage from them, they aren't rough or pointed, but I would have preferred a rounder edge on the hook tips."
5,Installs very easily and works like it should!,"I highly recommend the Adaptec AUA-5100 USB 2.0, 6 port card by Adaptec because of problems with Iogear. I originally purchased the Iogear GCI 250 U, 5 port, USB 2.0 PCI card and had severe problems. When shutting down my PC, the Iogear USB card would send a heavy pulse, most of the time, that would just about snap off the Microsoft Force Feedback 2 joy stick handle. Iogear e-mailed me a new driver. After installing the new driver, the problem still existed. Iogear told me to send the USB card back to Amazon.com for credit -- Iogear had no suggested fixes! The Adaptec AUA-5100 works just like Adaptec says it should. The Adaptec card is well worth the extra money. (Is the Iogear sending damaging pulses into printers?) Plus, Amazon.com promptly credited my account when I returned the Iogear USB card. I highly recommend Adaptec and definitely Amazon.com!"
5,Works good last a long time,Installation on an XP computer was easy. No problems with any aspect of this product. Friendly software that is actually quite cool. Great product.
5,Works Well,"The adapter was detected by Windows XP and worked on the first boot up after it was installed. I've used it with a USB wireless network adapter, multiple USB flash drives, and portable hard drives with no problems."
5,Reviewing the Prepac bookcase,Quick shipping from the seller. It had detailed instructions and was easy to set up. I recommend this bookcase to anyone that's looking for a basic set-up.
4,The God,Rakim is always worth the listen. Brothers are still catching up with his genius. I wasn't pleased with the Dr. Dre tracks. I never did think that marriage would work. When you can work words and lyrics that beautifullyyou have to keep the tracks gritty to match the flow. A good buy for all fans and the new crop of listeners.
5,Excellent watch for the money,"I've owned this watch for about 3 weeks now. The watch has a great feel to it which oozes quality. I have worn it all day every day and take it off at night. The watch loses about 3 seconds a day, but I'm sure this will change when it breaks in. The one thing that I've read about this watch is that the lug screws which fasten the bracelet to the watch can sometime fall out, and this is a pain b/c Invicta asks you to mail in the entire watch to replace the single screw. Instead, I put a drop of clear nail polish into each lug and called it a day.Nothing else to say that hasn't been said already. Great buy!"
3,...not so happy,"Quality is OK, price is OK, but the time piece does not keep the time so sharp...it is always behind about five minutes every month or so...and the date is never centered with the window. My two cents."
1,Watch stopped after 9 months of daily use -,"Nice Watch. solid, gets lots of compliments. But after wearing it for 9 months, it just stopped. Service is estimated to take 6 to 8 weeks."
3,Beautiful Watch. Good Price. Quality....?,"Very nice looking watch for a good price, but quality...? I had the watch for less than a week and one of the screws securing the wristband to the watch fell out. Thank goodness I noticed this before the watch fell off my wrist. Not sure why the band is screwed on unlike older 9937s I've seen with bands secured with pins. I returned the watch to Amazon and received $295.01 of the 299.99 paid. I'm not particularly happy with this but it's not worth fighting for ~$5. I would like to try the 9937 again but it is currently unavailable from Amazon. Maybe others are having a similar issue with the wristband. BTW, like one of the previous reviewers my 9937 also had the ""coin edge"" bezel unlike the picture on Amazon. I too like the coin bezel."
5,INVICTA #9937 25 Jewel Swiss Automatic Movement,"It is impossible to say enough good things about this watch. Beautifully crafted by Invicta, this watch is what a Rolex Submariner will never be. For an MSRP. of $690.00, it is an absolute steal for the money. It is every bit as nice as the Rolex, and you can save over $3000.00 in the process. If you shop around you can get one for significantly less than the $690.00 MSRP. The ETA 25 Jewel Automatic movement is precise and is a wonderful Swiss made classic. This watch is a great addition for those looking for a collectible Swiss made automatic timepiece. Remember, after years of use an automatic timepiece generally will increase in value, while quartz watches become valueless."
1,Watch out for this watch!,This was a gift for my husband. It never worked. We sent it in for repairs and it would be gone for months at a time. When it was sent back it still never worked. We did this three times. Finally I took it to a local watch repairman and he couldn't fix it either It's now two years later with all the sending back and forth and to late to return it! Very bad!
4,Mostly pleased,"I'll start with really my only beef: the watch gains about 15-20 seconds a day. I keep it in an autowinder when I'm not wearing it, and I wonder if it would be better to let it wind down occasionally...It is a large, heavy watch, but it's really quite attractive. I've gotten a number of compliments on it. I can't speak to its long-term quality or how much it resembles other more expensive watches."
4,Honkin' Big Watch,"Was given this watch as an xmas gift. Simply knocked over. Big yellow box. Great big watch. Easy to read face. Well constructed case and band. Details on face are crisp, wings on second hand are crisp. Date cyclops eye magnifies well and is easy to read. Kept time to within fifteen seconds per day (fast) out of the box, and has settled down to about ten seconds fast per day. My only complaint may have more to do with me than with the watch. It occasionally stops overnight. Could be because of my sedentary lifestyle. I'm no longer driving much during the day.This watch replaced a replica Rolex (nick-named the ""Polex"" by one of my sons) that I picked up in Thailand. The Polex was humming along just fine until I dropped it about thirty inches to a hardwood floor. The impact appears to have been beyond its design/engineering limits.Wonder what would happen with the Invicta."
1,Horrible delivery time,"Product is exact replacement nothing bad on the manufactuer Attwood.After purchasing this item the receipt email said estimated delivery time 3-5 business days. Well 5 days later I get an email telling me that my order was being processed and will ship in 3-5 days. I emailed the company with complaints and never got any response. I even explained in my email for them to contact me, again no response.Needless to say 10 days after placing my order the bow eyes showed up in my mail box, that is 5-7 days late. I will never order from this person again and will suggest if you need anything quickly not to do so."
3,jumbo playing cards,"These cards are great, my daughter is using them for save the date for her Wedding, we found them terrific for the wedding theme, Alice in Wonderland !!!! Love them !We are putting velum on top with a Red Heart Stud and red print on the velum for the words.Excellent price !!!!"
5,Orginal!,"Emma's always knew she's been different than her escentric thinkign family. WHen it comes to appearence her fair skin and blond hair a big contrast to her darker, tanner, family. When it comes to personality she's alwasy been much more serious and organized. But when she takes a new job helping out on an elderly man's house her life takes a magical turn. Suddenly everythign she know's is a lie. Her past is a mystery and she has a casue she never thought existed.I absolutely loved this book. It was orginal, magical, and hearful. Emma is someone you can totally relate to. If your a fan of books that take place when the normal clashes with the supernatural this is definatly a book for you. This is the first book I've read by this author but definatly not the last! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
2,Okay reading,I am not so impressed with this book as Ms. McMillian others. The Flip Side of Sin was not like her other books and I was sooooo dissappointed. Rosalyn left quite a few unanswered questions and it was to much talk about Rosemary (Jesus Christ). I am still a great fan of Rosalyn and will continue to purchase her future books but please try not to dissappoint your fan base.
1,Why????,"I think Rosalyn McMillan is the most UNTALENTED scribe on the planet ! She doesn't even deserve the title writer! I just wish my sister was a talented author so I could ride her coattails to success. I ask you people, why do you keep buying her books? It just makes her release more of her literary garbage...Please Rosalyn, for us, stick to being Terri's sister!"
3,A Big Disappointment,"Rosalyn McMillan is truly one of my favorite authors but she missed the mark on this one. First of all, there was too much boring focus on Rosemary and not nearly enough on Kennedy. I would have liked to find out more about why Kennedy turned to a career in law enforcement and her struggle to raise a teenaged son. I also would have liked it if Kennedy and Issac had rekindled their relationship. The whole governor's race plot could have been left out and maybe saved for another book. In the end, I was left with alot of questions. Was Issac's son safe on the streets? Who was behind the police corruption? Did Rosemary ever recover? Did she ever tell Issac the dark family secret? There were way too many themes in this book that just didn't gel together. One Better and Knowing were much better books. I would suggest buying those titles and borrowing this one from the library. Hopefully, her next one will be better."
3,three books in one,"I recently read this book and I must say I was little disappointed from her previous books. This book was actually 3 books in disguise as one. I thought her main character Issac was a refreshing change from what has been prviously written about black men. However this book lelft too many stones uncovered. 1) Loren Lake, what happen to this scandelous politican and exactly what role did he play in Issacs incareration. How could a man so invested in destroying Issac suddenly disappear especially one Issac started dating his ex. 2) His cell mate was actually his Father? come now this was too cleaned up toward the end. 3) why did the gay inmate hand his sister a letter while she was visitng Lowestien? what was in letter? 3) Kennedy and Dect Royale what was the relationship? Did he set her up to be murdered?I felt like she was going in too many directions"
2,Buy at your own risk,"I anxiously awaited Ms.McMillan's new release. After I read ""Blue Collar Blues"", I just knew that ""The Flip Side of Sin"" was going to be even better. Wrong. Ms. McMillan tried too hard to weave too many mini-scenerios together. The tone of the book is altogether depressing. Even the spirituality didn't come through to me as being uplifing. The joy that Rosemary should have as a child of God, and a minister didn't come through. Also, her condition wasn't even addressed at the conclusion. So many of the mini-scenerios weren't wrapped up. I finished this book in total disbelief and confusion."
2,What Happened to.....?,"This book would have been a better read, if Ms. McMillan had stuck with the main characters instead of trying to deal with so many different themes. It seemed in the beginning she was trying to give so much ""TMI"" to small parts of the characters lives, that when you got to the middle of the book, the main issues that the characters were dealing with left you ""hanging."" At the end of the book, I felt as if I had just started reading it. I had so many questions that were leftunanswered. I hope she is not going to do a sequel to this book, because it was not that good. My advice to anyone -- is to borrow it from the library and save your money."
2,Too many issues!,"Having read both of Ms. McMillan's previous novels, I was really excited about purchasing this new book. Unfortunately, I was truly disappointed. The author tries to deal with every issue plauging society today: racism, religion, politics, homelessness, incarceration, gang violence, loss of a parent, police corruption, sexism, health issues (diabetes, high blood pressure), and parenting. Whew! Then, she threw in a few historical lessons about Detroit, as if there wasn't enough to distract from the basic plot.The only thing that kept me reading was a really complex and interesting main character. Whenever the author chose to focus on Isaac's developing kinship with his son, the pages flew!Bottom line: Try to catch the book on sale."
3,a few to many pages,"This book is one of her better ones. The story is pretty good of a man who made one bad choice trying to make it better. It is good to read about the positive outlook after a man gets out of prison and trys to improve his life with the family he left behind. If you have ever had anyone incarcerated directly or indirectly you can feel her story, but if you haven't reading this story should help you to get the troubles a person has to go through to regain respect in society. I really enjoyed how she tied in the spiritual aspect. I do think the story was a on going on and could of ended a couple chapters earlier. This is still her better one. Just stick with the story and you will enjoy the ending."
1,"Too Much, Too Preachy!!!","There are not enough words in the world for me to describe how much I disliked this book. The author has enough ""issues"" for about 10 books crammed into 1. None of the characters or situations were close to being believable. All the characters were extremely selfish, I never cared what happened to any of them. Fair or not, the only reason I kept reading it was because of the McMillan name. I kept waiting for it to get better, it never did. Very disapointing."
2,Too Many Unanswered Questions,"I really think Rosalyn has writing potential, however I was really disappointed in ""Flip Side"". I kept thinking, the book has to get better, but it never did. Rosalyn tried to tackle too many themes which left the reader puzzled and confused. Our reading group chose this book as November's selection, and everyone agreed that she had not done a good job. If you must read this book, borrow a copy. Rosalyn, you need a new editor and better luck on the next one."
2,"Sorry, didn't like this one","Issac just out of prison after serving time for killing a little girl while driving drunk. I felt the book would have been better if we could have learned more about Issac before he went to prison. I would have rather read more about Mercella, like how did her family feel about her dating the guy who killed her niece. The only thing i really liked about this book is Issac and his son's becoming a father and son again."
1,Boring!!!!!,"I'm half way through this book and I'm so bored I don't know if I can finish. This is the second book I've read by Rosalyn McMillan and I'm sooo disappointed. ""Knowing"" was the first one of hers that I read and I really enjoyed it. Like I said, I've only read half of the book, but at this point I could not, would not recommend it. Can I get a refund??"
3,Dark secrets from the past,My favorite part of this story was unveiling the dark secrets from the past ! While it is true there were so many issues going on in this story . I especially enjoyed seeing the light shine in on the dark secrets from the past !While Rosalyn is one of my favorite authors ( I have and have read all her work with 4 and 5*)I too was some what disappointed with this novel ! I felt it was not all that it could have been ! I know not all book will be great reads .When I bought this novel I felt that it was not going to be as great as her other books but what can I say I am a big fan of Rosalyn and I will be waiting for her next book and I pray that it is as great as Knowing and One Better !Make us proud again Rosalyn! For those of you that have not bought it and is undecided . I'll say get the best discount or wait for the paperback version ! Not a bad story just not her best !
2,I could not get into it!,I could not get into this book! I love Rosalyn but this one was not as good as Knowing. The characters and plot were slow. I did not finish the book (which is very rare for me)... I hope her next effort is much more interesting
2,This was just OK!!!!!!!,"I love Ms. McMillian and this book was an ok read, however there were too many things going on in ths book and I walked away with a lot of queations un-answered. I look forward to your next novel."
2,basically political quotes and bible scriptures,"i thought that the story was plagued with too much long and boring political dialogue. i found myself skimming through the pages to avoid this part. hopefully nothing ""sizzling"" was missed during my skimming"
1,Reading this book should be a Sin,"Don't waste your money on this book. I'm an avid book reader and I couldn't get past page 160 and that was a tremendous struggle just to get there. What possessed you to write this book, Roz? Next to Toni Morrison books, it was the most incomprehensible read I've ever read. Well, at least you can say as terrible as this book is that ""you got paid"" anyway. I'd like to recommend to your readers a book called ""Waiting to Exit Hell."" No, it's not written by Terri, but it's as good as Terri Mc."
1,NOT HAPPY,"I really enjoyed the first books by the author, but this was a big disappointment. It was poorly written and the story didn't go anywhere. I am making my self finish the book, but only becuase I am hoping it gets better."
2,Not a good read,"I've read Rosalyn McMillan's first book ""Knowing"", and attempted to read the second book entitled ""One Better"" and that is when I found out what a horrible storyteller she is. Her latest effort The Flip Side... was truly a disappointment. My bookclub decided to read this and inside I groaned because I was prepared for a weak book. As other readers have mentioned, she has too much going on and is trying to tackle numerous societal problems which only confused me. There were several typos and grammatical errors in this book. I think Mrs. McMillan should take some writing courses and fine tune those writing skills."
4,Very Good Read,"I have read everything Ms. McMillan has published. I feel as if I have grown with her writings. I really enjoyed the storyline. The positive outlook for a black incarcerated male reentering today's society and standing up for himself and his child was very uplifting. I enjoyed the religious realm that Rosemary provided. I do agree with a previous review, whereas I thought the ending felt alittle rushed. There were quite a few loose ends that I didn't feel were wrapped up appropriately but ....I enjoyed the read ... Enjoy"
2,The Flip Side of Sin,"As were others, I greatly anticipated this book, but unlike some I was greatly disappointed. Ms. McMillan has ranged greatly in her subject matter in her novels but this one really took the cake! It seemed to me she rushed to put this book out because it didn't follow any pattern. But I haven't lost faith, I'll purchase the next book because I believe everyone has a bad day."
3,Positive and Uplifting,"After reading some of the reviews I really didn't want to read this novel but because I'm a fan of Rosalyn McMillan, I had to be the judge for myself.I must say that this novel didn't display the writing style of Rosalyn that I'm use to but I can tell that she has improved her unique style and can still tell a good story.This novel deals with real issues that families face today or at some point in their lives...Incarceration, troubled teens, drugs, political corruption, religion and romance.I enjoyed this novel overall. The novel ended with some questions unanswered so I'm wondering if we should keep an eye out for a sequel? Be Blessed."
2,You May Already Own This...,"Four stars for the album itself (see DARK LIGHT for details), but zero for whoever decided to re-release it with a different name. If you own DARK LIGHT, you own this. If you don't, buy this one - it's cheaper!"
3,expect to be dissapointed,"I expected much better to be honest..We do find out that Morgan grows up to be the powerful witch we knew she was going to be, but the story could have improved much more with Hunter's and Morgan's adult experiences instead of forwarding 15 yrs too fast. I found Moira to be selfish and without empathy for Morgan's pain and we certainly could have been better without her complaints and teen angst..Overall 3 stars for Morgan's and Hunter's future and half a star for Moira's involvement to the story."
3,"ugh, dissapointment","I found this book really hard to read. It's still good, but I only suggest reading this if you enjoyed the books that were from a different point of view. If you want to know how Morgan's story ends go on a fansite and read some spoilers."
2,Very dissapointing...,"I have a die hard fan of the Sweep Series since the first book came out. I was so excited when I found out Night's Child was going to be released and I bought it the day it came out. As much as i love Sweep, I have to say that this final book was very dissapointing. The book felt forced and unrealistic. It was hard to get into the story because Morgan just didnt feel like the Morgan you get so close to in the rest of the series. With out Hunter, the story seems empty. I almost regret reading this book becasue it ruined the essence of the sweep series. I would still recommend reading the book, but just be prepared for a major let down."
2,Super Sweep?,"Well it was an okay book but left me empty inside. It was not as emotional. I love all 14 of the regular series but this one kinda made me mad. Morgan seems TOO powerful, like no challenge can come in her way. In the Sweep series shehad to figure out things and well there was a bit of luck to it. But in this book she can do just about anything. And Hunter dies in the beginning, that is what should happen, none of this o wait never mind he has been trapped on an island without food and such for sixtenn years! come on, like that would EVER happen. Moira is just a little twit with no real emotions. Plus all that happened in the book was WAY predictable. Over all if you liked the series and thought of your own happy ending on what happened with Morgan and Hunter, dont read this book. It is a disappointment."
5,She MUST write at least ONE sequel to this,"this was TRULY a masterpiece! its about 16 yrs later from when we last saw Morgan, and she has a daughter Moira Byrne. her husband Colm has recently died and Morgan is having disturbing visions(sort of) and there is some1 trying to hurt her and Moira. She finds that Hunter is not dead and there is something about Moira that she doesn't know. if you wanna know then you'll have to read it ; )"
3,Night's Child,"I liked this book, maybe not as much as the other WICCA books. I got confused a little about the whole jumping foward all those years bit. I dont like 15 year old Moira as much as I liked 17 year old Morgan. I liked the length of this book more than the others though, there was more attention to detail. I thought the whole de ja vu thing with Selene and Cal and Ian and his mum was quite good, but kind of the same thing that happened with Morgan when she was Moiras age. I would of definitly have liked to have read about Morgan's life from 17 onwards, instead of skipping straight to here. All in all, I do hope there is more books to follow this one. Anyone know if there is???"
3,Not as Great as it could have been,first off i'd like to say that it was an interesting twist and there were some ok parts but basically it sucked. problem is it was like a repition of what Morgan went through for Moira. and why does Hunter have to die-don't worry that wasn't a spoiler-it is in the first chapter. i could think of tons of things to make that book better. i'm sorry the series didn't come out with a big bang of excellency. i'll miss the series
2,blank,"i don't think this was as good as the other books, i didnt like how morgan had been writen in this book and i think it was set to far into the future.in the other books they had a realness to them but to me this one was a bit fake( no_one could survive that long on an island).if you read and liked the other books them read this one, but otherwise don't bother.."
4,exciting!,"This book shoots you forward in time and shows some of the book through Moira's eyes(Morgan's daughter). I really like this book, but it wasn't as good as some of the others; it leaves a lot of space between the last book and this book so there are some things that never get figured out. But i thought it was really good. I read it in about 2 hours. I couldn't put it down!"
2,Poor series...sigh.,"Okay, I hate writing bad reviews, but I was very dissapointed with this book. I even got bored every once in a while and my book sat unread for a bit.I was so dissapointed about Hunter, but the end, I'm sure HunterxMorgan fans will totally love :-DNow, don't get me wrong, if you have read the whole Sweep series, I encourage you to read this. It's basically an epilogue.If you liked the ending before though, maybe you don't even want to read it, which might be a wise decision.As a complete Sweep freak, I must say...this book was awful. :)Heh, sorry Cate."
5,Awsome book!,"I loved this book. It's an amazing journey. You do really have to have read the rest of this series first, though, because most of what happens in them is retold in this book."
1,Not quite good enough,"I agree pretty much with Bob Denhaan in that these are not really very secure. I had to fool around a lot in adjusting the fit of the caps on the rings to get them to stay closed but they still pop open easily with the slightest bump. Mine are basically OK for now because I keep them on an air rifle propped up by the back door to nab an occasional squirrel, but if I had to rely on these for a rifle being carried in the field, NO WAY! I'll never buy another one.Update 2/27/2012These covers have gone from bad to worse. It has now become impossible to keep them from staying closed even for a minute on their own. NEVER again!"
5,butler creek blizzard scope cover #9,"just like on the reviews for the other butler creek covers. This is a great scope cover, easy to shoot without even flipping the cover up. Water and dirt tight. Durable. Good product."
2,Incorrect image,"Beware! As indicated in the Technical Details, this soap dish is WHITE, not chrome as depicted in the photograph. And the shape of the soap dish I received is also different from the photo."
3,Not for me.,This book was not for me. I have no intention of visiting the great majority of the places she describes.
2,Good assembly...Bad detailing,"I would have given this a MUCH better review if Revell would have taken the time to accurately measure the decals in the set. It was very enjoyable putting this together until I got to detailing the figure (Jeff Gordon) that goes inside the car. When I went to add the decals to the Helmet everything was too big for the figure. The only decals that actually fit were the dupont flame symbols that went down the legs (the part you cant see though the windows). But then again, you couldn't tell they were flames because the paint pattern and the decal pattern were practically the same color. I have not gotten to the actual car yet but they look like they will be correct. I think that if you are going to put something in a model, take the time to figure out the dementions. If you are good enough to do your own paint detailing on the figure this would be an excellent model. You could then just toss those decals."
5,The West Point book,"I am looking to get into West Point at a young age and this book gave me some importants facts that should help me for the future. Great book, strongly sugest that you get it."
1,pen,"Well, I expected this product to be multifunctional, but what I received, was just a nice pen. That's all!! I called the company number a few times, left messages, and never heard back!! I was frustrated, so I gave up, and I definitely wasn't going to try to order it again to get the right product.Customer service was worthless to me."
2,Disappointing......,"I've seen so much better from Cameroon. I grew up listening to this music and was really hoping for something special, but the sound quality is horrible. It's the equivalent of a blurry picture. Being musically inclined, I have an idea as to what they were trying to achieve, but this compilation is nowhere near there. Not representative at all of the great choral music availabe from this land. A waste of money!There's better stuff out there from Cameroon."
3,"Great lamp, but.....","Loved the lamp, looked just like I thought. But of the three bulbs one did not work. They are the CFL type which are costly to replace."
4,Excellent Birthday Gift!,A mention of this game in Sports Illustrated caught my eye and I thought it would make an appropriate gift for my husband's birthday. And did I ever hit a home run with this one! He was thrilled to know this game was still available (and updated to current baseball statistics)and we have had lots of fun with it.
5,Best text based baseball game.,"I started playing Strat-O-Matic Baseball in 1965, at age 12. It was the second season released by SOM, I believe. I've tried other games over the years and nothing else comes close to statistical accuracy in replay and attention to detail. Everything is taken into consideration, pitcher stats, hitter stats, fielders, weather conditions, etc. You can play a game using the advanced rules in about 30 minutes with the board game. I use the computer game, that can be set up to show the individual player cards. You can play any games you want, and have the computer play the others. If you're thinking about a baseball strategy game, where brains matter more than reflexes, make SOM Baseball your first choice."
1,Not as Advertised,"The product description says that the game comes with 6 teams from 2010, and I received teams from 2007. I was also originally under the impression from the title that it would contain all MLB teams from 2011. Do not purchase this, unless you were already planning on additionally purchasing a specific season."
3,get adaptec's duo connect instead,"Adaptec has a Duo Connect PCMCIA card that has both a firewire and a USB 2.0 port. This is perfect for video editing on a PC laptop: connect a camera to the firewire port and an external hard drive to the USB 2.0 port. When not video editing, you can use the extra USB port for your printer, mouse, etc., or keep the hard drive attached to run games."
4,I Want a Friend Like Paige,"As the doors to Lauren's past keep opening, getting ""curiouser and curiouser"" as the saying goes, Paige stands tall as the one true friend Lauren can count on. Intimidated by nobody, stepping right up into every breach, we should all be so lucky as to have such a friend.And just when I'm settled down to read a story about daughter India's journey to discover her true past, I learn that what I'm actually getting is window onto her mother Lauren's surprising history. There's a lot more to this suburban ""soccer mom"" than any of the ladies in carpool would imagine. (And no, I'm not telling.)What I expected to be a ""relationship"" novel about mothers and daughters then turns into a really enjoyable whodunit, filled with twists and reversals worthy of a writer of far greater experience.I liked this book. A relationship novel that even a man can enjoy. Well done, Ms. Reid. I'll buy your next book."
1,Poorly written,"This book was so poorly written that I simply could not get through it. The writer is extremely cheesy in her word choices, and I constantly found myself wondering how this woman ever got published in the first place.Save your money and buy something else."
3,Not too bad,"Although the book was highly predictable, with its silly coincidences, and character flaws, I did enjoy the book. It was charming and heart warming, and for the most part a page turner. It wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't terrible either. To the author I would say, for your first novel, good work and keep writing."
1,How interesting...,"Why would someone buy this bad pop music when they could buy ""Demon Days"" by the Gorillaz? I'd have to be drunk, deaf, and have a frontal lobotomy to purchase this garbage after hearing actual musical talent blasting the airwaves and clubs."
1,Bad bad bad,"BEP where a decent, indie-minded non-gangsta rap group on their earlier efforts. They brought a Tribe Called Quest/Roots type vibe which offered a nice change of pace from all the tiresome tough guy faux-posturing and bling bling imagery of most modern rap. Things have steadfastly gone downhill though. It seems mandatory that this shift towards commercialization and radio-friendly compromise is required of most up and coming artists, be it rap or rock.Fergie is definitely irritating, I don't find her talented at all. She just brings the T and A factor which helped the Peas gain more recognition. Also, while I like positive hip hop, this stuff just gets so smarmy and poppy it makes me sick to my stomach after a while. BEP definitely ""made it"", but good music is not what they're ""makin'"". If you want a musically diverse, positive and talented rapper than check out Blackalicious."
1,Why don't alvin and the chipmunks rap?,"When I heard this album I posed this question upon myself. If alvin and the chipmunks rapped they would be just as good as these clowns. The peas can definitely dance and they have some beats, but rhyming is not their game. They should just be some hype dancers for beyonce or back up for missy's wack a$$."
2,Not Great,"The single ""Don't Phunk with My Heart"" is literally the best track on the album. The music is good but the lyrics are not all that great and even at that, the music gets boring after a few songs. I found it hard to listen to it all the way through. Nothing really grand or exciting and nothing that would make you want to listen to it over and over again."
1,Arrrghh!! This group is literally f*****g with my heart right now.,"First time I heard this Don't Phunk With My Heart from the radio and couple of times thereafter it sounded quite impressive, but when the radio stations started to play it continously day by day, I finally got fed up. The last act was when my 9 yrs old little sister bought this munky biz, and still listens to it, especially song don't ""f**k"" wit my heart quite often, like she listens to that Gwen Stefani's sheit, L.A.M.B. too.Arrrghh! Damn, I can't take it anymore. It nearly makes me wanna do suicide or something when my ears have to suffer by the force of hearing this kinda music too often."
1,1 Star for Like That,"But every other song is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. Like That is great though...too bad they had to sell out so badly, they were going places."
1,Wack eyed peas.,"I normally don't bother writing negative reviews, but this band annoys the (...) out of me. They more or less represent every thing about a band I usually can't stand. Pop garbage, terrible lyrics, lame image, and a she-male who wets herself on stage. Like someone else said, perfect if you're a 14 year old who hasn't developed any taste yet. They make Kelly Clarkson sound good."
5,love it,"All I can say is ""My Humps"" is the BEST song in the world. I can't get it out of my head. I LOVE IT!!!"
3,This cd is okay,"I kinda like this cd but I hate the song ""my humps"" that song is so inerpropriate for kids but everybody at my school sings it. I don't because I think it's annoying. I like the ""elephunk"" cd better. They have better songs on it."
5,Brainwashed,"I loooooove this cd. I do not know how long I've had it but every time I play it, it's new to me. I especially love Wil I Ams' voice."
3,If You Don't Listen To The Lyrics...,"I'm totally into the Black Eyed Peas...except now they are starting to contradict themselves. From song to song, some themes are repeated, but from the opposite end of the track.The beats are amazing, and almost mindblowing. You could listen to this in the car, and you'd love it. It'd pump you up for the day.But still...Good, but not a 5 star classic, or even a 4 star ""great album of the year"". Elephunk was a 4, this is a 3...who knows what will happen to this once great band..."
1,Sting why oh why,"How people fork over their hard earned cash for this over- produced garbage is mind boggling. I love all music. All forms...This form..I have no idea what this is. It is classified as Funk..HOW? Does anyone hear any funk here? Does this even resemble George Clinton, James Brown (and he makes a guest appearence on this..ughhh) or Brothers Johnson?? Its bands like these that make me wonder why I can't stand 2000's pop music. Its like the late 1980's again (which gave us such garbage as New Kids and many other one hit wonders)Yes I listened though this and gave it a try, I just didnt post a review cause I dont like the Black Eyed Peas, I thought I give it a try...and it really sucks! And why is Sting on this album.?? His name shouldnt even appear on a piece of junk like this, but anyway if you wanna spend your cash on this junk, go ahead, but if you like pop music and want some beats at least go with Madonna, Pink, or Gorillaz over this mess..."
1,Garbage...,No talent ass clowns. (NTACs) They steal most of the few melodies they have from old music. At least Puff Daddy was good at it.
2,A Definite Decline,"I have been listening to the Peas since Behind the Front came out. Both Behind the Front and Bridging the Gap were great albums, and while Elephunk was more pop-oriented and less lyrical, it was still a very good production. That being said, Monkey Business is a sub-par performance, going one step further than Elephunk into the pop netherworld. If you really liked Bridging the Gap and Behind the Front, this album will definitely disappoint. If your first exposure to BEP was Elephunk and you liked it, you'll probably enjoy Monkey Business, but it goes so far overboard you may not. Anyway, Like That is a very good song (with guests like Talib, Q-Tip, John Legend and Cee-Lo, it would be hard to screw a song up), but there aren't really any other standouts on this album."
1,Get The Phunk Outta Ma Face,"Okay. I see three Black men on the front of a CD and the CD is titled ""Monkey Business."" Talk about buffoonery. I couldn't get into this because I'm not really into mainstream watered-down hip-hop. I don't care if these guys are popular right now and have 3 number one hits. I don't like what the whole MTV crowd likes or considers music. The Black Eyed Peas act like they're doing something hip and innovative on this CD, but the sampling is out of control and there's absolutely nothing new being brought to the table. Everything sounds the same and Fergie can't sing or dance. The only thing Fergie can do is pose and act cute when she's actually not. Her only reason for being in the group is to make it more appealing to the mainstream masses. ""Monkey Business"" is wack to the max and is something soccer moms would jam too because they want to be ""cool moms"". Skip this at all costs."
2,A sad triumph of greed over quality,"BEP was one of my favorite hip-hop acts of the late 90's. Their Debut album ""Behind the Front"" and even their Sophomore album ""Bridging the Gap"" continued a musical approach and ideology more akin to Tribe Called Quest, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, and the Roots than the current Gangster Rap trend.After this however, BEP apparently figured out that they can make more money with intellectually depraved dance tracks than they can with original music. And it's a shame.Money Business is a perfect example of an album crafted from bottom to top for pop appeal. In 2004 (with Elephunk) BEP left the Artistic music community and joined the commercial music community. It was sad to see them go."
1,WHAT THE?,"Ok, so every piece of music deserves a chance. But I'll be honest-this is garbage. I mean, my humps? Come on. What has music come to? Just kill me now! This falls in NO musical category."
4,Monkey Business,"After loving `Elephunk' and some of the singles from this album, I thought I would give `Monkey Business' a whirl. Whilst this is till very good and gives us more of the rap/dance/vocal mix we like, I find it less satisfying that `Elephunk' and there a more tracks I will skip past. Saying that, the tracks I like are so infectious it more than makes up for it. The album opener `Pump It' gets your arms pumping in time and `Don't Funk With My Heart' has a chorus that gets you yelling along with abandon and a beat to get you out of your seat dancing at the same time. This also has some daft songs and I can never take `My Humps' seriously, despite its popularity. Overall though this offers up more of the same music that got me hooked first time round and should please existing and new fans alike.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,A few great songs only.,"I have always liked The Black Eyed Peas but it seems that their best songs are only the ones released as a singles. The best songs are Pump It, Don't Phunk with my Heart, Don't Cry and My Humps.I know a lot of reviews bagged My Humps as being an awful song, but i disagree. Listen to it with a great sound system and a 15 inch Subwoofer and you will see why i like it. The bass is out of this world! The same goes for the other songs mentioned earlier.As far as the other songs go on the cd...I wouldn't cross the street to listen to them. You are better off just downloading the songs you hear that are released as singles, the rest is garbage."
3,Fergie is Awesome - Rest Okay,Fergie is awesome! Rest is okay. Good cd overall though if you like their music.
4,"Dont take ""My Humps"" so seriously","This is a great album overall, highly original in my opinion, though not as intellectual as their older lyrics. As for the track ""My Humps"", which is the song most ridiculed on this album, its supposed to be funny. Come on, there are plenty of superficial girls out there who actually think like that. Listen to the lyrics of the other songs more carefully, and moreover, listen to their oldeer lyrics. BEP is making a social commentary w/that song, they just happened to approach it w/some humor. Same goes for a few other songs on this album."
5,Love it!,"This album is fantastic. It's both original and a great tribute (a fun one) to many great styles and artists. The album kicks off beautifully with the tribute to Dick Dale, then goes into Don't Phunk with My Heart and just keeps getting better. I also secretly love Fergie...well, not anymore :-)"
1,Too Bad I Can't Give it Zero Stars,"Yeah, that's right. I know I'm among the few giving it one star amongst all of these people raving about how great this album is. Honestly people. The music has been done, there are no surprises. What I'm trashing most about this album is the lyrics. I'm not one to shy away from music based on lyrics, but this takes the take for Worst Lyrics Ever, and that's saying something. Has anyone read the lyrics to ""My Humps?"" Just looking at the song titles gives you an idea of how dumb the lyrics will be (Don't Phunk With my Heart). Really, what were they thinking. I've only got one reasonable explanation to why they're so popular. They sold their souls. There's no other plausable explanation other than that. Thanks a lot Satan."
1,"The most mainstream, sell-out group EVER? Yes.","It's true that the Black Eyed Peas exist for no reason but to make money: it's like they were designed to sell MP3s and ringtones. What about the music? Apparently, ""My Humps"" isn't about Fergie being a hunchback; instead, she tries to bedazzle us by ""singing"" about her mammary glands. ""My humps, my lady lumps..."" HOW CREATIVE!There's no point in boycotting them because of their legions of brainwashed zombie followers who say ""holla at a playa, didja get dat new Black Eyed Peas sh*t? Les go clubbin'!"" . Just ignore this four-piece group though, because by 2007, they'll go the way of the Spice Girls."
1,what is this?,"BEP were cool, afrocentric and meaningful once upon a time. They added fergi to their band....i dont know why...she has no talent att all...all she can do is look good and dance around...the prefect posterchild to prostitute their music...this is bad..absolute filth not even worth a penny...MTV killed this band like it has killed many others...i can only hope they save all the money they are making, their 15 minutes are about to be up...i wont to say so many bad things about fregi but i am afraid my review might not be posetd...this is a horrible CD do not buy it."
2,"THIS ISN'T REALLY HIP/HOP, OR RAP.......","IT'S MORE LIKE DANCE AND R&B MIXED TOGETHER WITH FORGETABLE RYMES. I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THIS GROUP HAS TURNED INTO THE USED TO BE A KILLER ACT. I SAW THEM 3 TIMES SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE DOING SOME SMALLER VENUES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR FIRST ALBLUM AND THE F*CKIN JAMMED AS A UNIT. NOW THEIR SOUND IS JUST RECYCLED DRAB THAT ALOT OF BANDS HAVE DONE BEFORE. AND JUST TO MAKE A COMMENT TO THE HEADLINE""BROADER HORIZONS"". WHAT A NICE WAY TO SAY THEY COMPLETELY SOLD OUT!"
2,Missing,"I went through two orders and a bunch of stores trying to get this album, so I was expecting something great. Uh...no. What the hell is ""Don't Lie"" and ""My Humps""? Garbage! Most of the songs were lacking and the words just rhymed technically with no particular motive. Until I got to ""Like That"" with John Legend, Q-tip, and Talib Kweli. That song was where I rememebered why I liked Black Eyed Peas. I am hurt that the album was so disappointing. I'll probably buy the next album though because I still like the style of the group, just not this cd."
1,Bad beyond imagination,The mere fact that this album is popular is enough of an argument for letting terrorists bomb this country into oblivion. The Black Eyed Peas have re-defined what awful music can sound like. These guys have zero talent and zero class.
1,"THIS IS THE MOST OVERHYPED, UNORIGINAL AND OVEREXPOSED RECORD OF THE YEAR","These songs are just obnoxious--as is their commercial tie ins to everything. THis group is being pushed down people's throats and I can't figure out why when there are so many more deserving bands out there. Does it really take that much talent to loop an old hook and right some stupidly rhyming lyrics over it--I think not. Please reward quality music and musicians and not this over produced, manufactured pop fluff. One of the worst albums of the year--hands down."
3,Slap in the face,"First of all let me say I am not a Black Eyed Peas ""fan"", i.e I don't have any of their albums. Second of all let me say that I'm only a fan of a few hip hop artists, but am a huge music fan in general.All I wanted to say was that anyone who says that ""My Humps"" is a terrible song is in denial because they don't want to admit they like it. It is pop perfection. Forget about the lyrics for a minute, and listen to the song. It is amazing."
1,the next MC Hammer,Ten years from now this group will be the punchline to all the jokes that currently feature MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice. It's hard to believe anyone takes it seriously.And could they possibly sell out a little more? Is there a commercial they DON'T have music in?
2,well..,"this album is the black eyed peas' worst yet. whats even more sad is that i am not surprised.. BEP used to be quality hip hop with their first two albums behind the front and bridging the gap. now with newcomer stacey ferguson in the group its just hip pop.there are a few good if not decent tracks on herepump it- fun to listen tolike that- featuring john legend qtip talib kweli and ceelobebot- apl's new tagalog songgone going- featuring jack johnsonaudio delite at low fidelityif you havent already picked up BEPs first two albums, do so instead of monkey business. if you already own the two, dont waste your money on this cause it really is just monkey business"
1,SOO DISAPOINTED!,"wow i dont know what to say..this album really ""stunk"" as a black eyed peas fan..i couldnt wait untill the ""monkey business"" C.D came out. being sucH a fan of their album ""elefunk"" i was really hoping for this one to be just as good or better. i was wrong. please take my advice and dont purchase this item. ofcourse you could be different and like it. This is just my opinion."
1,"I'd give it no stars, but I can't","Let me start this out right, B.E.P are a hip-hop group for people that aren't into real hip-hop, they've altered into this Saturday morning cartoon, bought by your mom at Wal-Mart type rap. I'm in no position to hate, i congratulate anyone that comes up, its just that this group has sold out, completely, they need to go back to their B-BOY roots and drop this ""monkey business"" crap.....oh yeah, Fergie is beautiful, but she belongs in a Cosmo magazine, not hip-hop.PEACE-marcus"
2,Fake Phunk At It's Best!,"The Black Eyed Peas Were. At one time, ""good"" in my opinion. Then came Elephunk... Anyway, this new album, ""Monkey Bulls*it,"" is very dissapointing. Nearly every song has the same feel, and t gets really boring, but the first two tracks, along with ""My Hump,"" are OK. Don't buy this trash unless you like fake rap. PS, Phunk isn't spelled that way..."
1,Absolute tripe,"This is not even real music. This is nothing put a bunch of computers making noises and a couple of untalented ""artists"" who posses the incredible gift of being able to rhyme. How is stuff like this even considered to be good in any context. Here are the ever so deep topics explored in ""Monkey Business"": my style, my humps, dum diddly, bebot, ba bump, and feel it. As we can see, these are all very intricate topics that the Black Eyed Peas feel obligated to examine through artistic expression and deep lyrical value**.GIVE ME A BREAK!** star indicates sarcasm"
3,So So,"Not as good as Elephunk but I still love the Black Eyed Peas! Worth a listen.Late 20's, Dallas, TX"
3,Its ok,This is another of those CDs that I kinda wish I had just paid the 99 cents for the songs I liked instead of getting the whole thing to tell the truth.
3,Pretty good,"I got this a a gift, so at first I was not sure if I wanted to keep it of sell it, as I am not really a BEP fan. In all honesty I know very little about this band, a song or two here and there. I decided to keep it and give it a try, I don't like the popular ""hits"" that much from this album, but was suprised at some of the really good album tracks. The players are very good on this album. There is a real sense of old school funk here that I really like.I guess you never know what you will like till you give it a try."
1,Poor....,"BEP were innovative when they first came out, there was plenty of hype. Even that they would become the next version of the Roots, with their live gigs. Behind the Front was were they were easily at their best, Bridging the Gap was the beginning of the end, and its been downhill from there. Their lyrics are well below par on this album, and the fact that their label made them put Fergie on makes them sellouts in my opinion... irrelevant of their music.Put simple easily their worst yet, and I wouldn't buy this to use as a coaster"
1,oh no no no no,The first two singles off the cd Fergie keeps repeating oh no no no though out the songs. Is the whole cd like this?
1,they tried but they miserably failed,"they tried to blend in a fusion of hip hop and world music but it ended up sounding like britney spears demos especially with fergine's horrible voice that was good once upon a time, but no more!"
2,Gimme a break...,"I LOVE Black Eyed Peas. They are a great Hip Hop group. I remember hearing LETS GET IT STARTED and liking it, so then I got this CD after hearing ""Don't Phunk With My heart.""I do like ""Dum Diddly"", ""Gone Going"", ""Don't Phunk With My Heart"", ""Audio Delite At Low Fidelity"", and ""My Style"", but ""My Humps""??????? GIMME A BREAK! THAT IS THE WORST SONG EVER! She's just talking about her body parts. Plus the other tracks, Even ""Pump It"" sound childlish. Plus what's with that weird sounding music on ""Like That""?So just get Elephunk, and not this Waste of $14.99."
4,BEP is phunking with my heart,"When I got their last album, it was really good and i thought that their follow up wouldn't match up and to my surprise it nearly did. I can listen to this album and like mostly every track. The only track that I don't like is ""Feel It"". It's kinda bland and doesn't really stand up. If your a true fan you'll love this record. If you just wanna get up and dance, then this record is for you.My favorites:My StyleMy HumpsDon't LieDon't Phunk With My HeartPump ItGone GoingLike That"
1,"Indie rock sucks, and this is no exception.",They're to busy trying to be different that they lack any musical talent. Even more terrible then Modest Mouse or Pixies.
2,BEP,"The lyrics what are doing with all that junk? All that junk inside that trunk? I'm get get get etc. you drunk, get you love drunk of my lady lump. my humps. etc that's all that I like about it."
1,Total and Complete Crap,"The Black Eyed Peas couldn't make a good song if they tried. Which they obviously don't, as evidenced by, well, everything on this CD, but especially ""My Humps,"" which is a serious candidate for worst song ever, right up there with Hollaback Girl and Gasolina I'd say. Buying this CD is like flushing $20 down the toilet and hitting yourself repeatedly with the toilet lid in the face. Only at least with the latter you won't have to hear ""My Humps,"" which might save you hours of expensive psychological counseling later."
1,www.sportofdistraction.com,"The minstrel show that the Black Eye Peas have become hurts the heart. I remember 6, 7 years back listening to their 1st album, thinking how fly the sound & vibe was. Am I saying they need to make the same music over & over?..of course not. But it's clear that they made a left when they should've made a right...they have become almost everything I have detested about hip-hop's evolution over the past 15 years.Damn you MC Hammer, Damn you Vanilla Ice, Damn you Bluff Daddy, Damn you, Damn you Def Jam, Damn you shirtless grown men making love songs for 12 year old girls (Ja Rule and all that have followed)...ha! Creations like this, and career decisions like that which has been taken by the Black Eye Peas, are the grandchildren of your careers coming to life."
3,An average album,"This C.D. is not all that similar to the successful Elephunk album which came before it, for it has less language and samples things a heck of a lot more often. Although I've seen this album rated low, I think that the rhythm sampling is very well done, and that the rap goes well with the often olden patterns that are used. The song I recommend most is ""They Don't Want Music"", which has periodic techno-buzz solos, a funky horn and guitar pluck background, and somewhat soulful lyrics. Although the themes for vocals are often childish (such as when they spell words out in the first song), or a bit on the ""bad side"" if you get what I'm talking about, for the most part Monkey Business is a very musically together C.D. which I would recommend to all rap fans. Even if you don't like rap, this unique album may appeal to you anyway.I recommend:Pump ItDon't Phunk With My HeartDon't LieDum DiddlyGone GoingThey Don't Want Music"
4,Hmm .. Monkey Business,"I'll give it a four, mostly half of the songs I would listen to, but I don't think I'd be able to finish the song before I switch to another one. It gets annoying how they repeat the same things, and Fergie, her voice sounds different in every single song. Now about My Humps, I used to like it, for maybe a month, as long as I didn't hear it too much, which all of the radio stations I listen to played it at least twice an hour, so that's about 10 times you hear My Humps in a single sixty minutes.So, here's my opinion on SOME of the songs.Pump It: Favorite Song on the CD. Fun to dance to.Don't Phunk With My Heart : Old, gets annoying with that beat.Don't Lie : Never really liked this song.My Humps : Used to like, WAY too annoying now to even listen to for a couple of seconds.So, yeah, that's what I think of those four songs. It really depends on what you like to buy this CD."
1,Worst song I've ever heard,"My Humps is true agony in ""music"" form. Another reviewer mentioned that the only good thing about the album was that the Black Eyed Peas could rhyme... my elementary school teachers would die to hear that the best effort they could make at rhyming was ""nicely"" with ""ices."" Please save us all from the unfortunate fact that this song is in heavy rotation."
3,I can't believe I like this--but I do.,"I feel like I'm selling out by writing a decent review for the Black Eyed Peas, but I really do like their new album ""Monkey Business."" Their first single ""Don't Phunk with My Heart"" is catchy and full of energy, which is a perfect way to describe the rest of the album. ""Gone Going,"" which samples a Jack Johnson song of the same name that I'm fond of, is a great summer song--light and head bopping-inducing.B.E.P. are really at their best when singing about hooking up and other frivolous matters. When they try to be deeper and tackle world problems, it's usually a mistake. Similarly, they are MUCH more pop than hip-hop, and when rapping takes place on the record, it sounds like they're trying too hard to take themselves seriously. Enjoy it for what it is--harmless filler that's easy to dance to."
1,Tortured in my office by BEP's,"After nearly a year of being in my current job a couple of my co-workers constantly played this absolutely annoying song that drove me up the wall. It was so utterly detestable I thought I would have to quit. Luckily, they play their music so low that it's just kind of like a bothersome mosquito buzzing in the room. Finally, today one of the co-workers walked out of the office and left the horrible tune playing on her computer. I finally decided to find out who this worthless music was made by so I walked over to her desk and saw -- Black Eyed Peas.This is the absolute worst garbage I've heard in recent years. Absolute contrived, simple-minded, commercialized, stench. This is one band that should be put in jail for brandishing instruments in a public setting."
1,This CD kills brain cells,"I have never heard a song as stupid as ""My Humps"", except perhaps Ba Bump, but that is a very tight race. If cavemen were alive today, they could have come up with better lyrics. More offensive b/c of the stupidity than anything else. Spend your money on ANYTHING besides this CD."
1,What Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this album is everything but good anyone who gave this album a score of 3 or higher then you obviosly havent listened to the album. dthe album is terrible. almost all of the songs are fillers and there is no ""phunk"". the album consists of of the girl whining and she cannot sing. The black guys cannot rap. i have no clue why anyone likes this album. there is no point if you are listening to complete garbage.SO WHAT EVER PEOPLE AND DONT FALL IN THE CROWD ON THIS DEAL BECAUSE THIS ISNT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!"
4,not a great kid cd,"I loved this CD. However, I do not like CDs that have a lot of cursing in them. This CD is definitely not for kids below the age of 12. That's all I can say."
1,What Makes A Good Album?,"The cohesiveness of the music, forming an organic entity, that's what.What makes a poor album?A haphazard collection of songs.Monkey Business is full of catchy, nonsensical lyrics. I guess that appeals to a certain group - not me though. If you want superficial songs which are silly and ill-composed, buy this album. If not, save your money."
4,An honest opinion...,"I like this album a lot. Although I really dislike My Humps, the rest of the album is enjoyable. It's definitely not rap music, but I'm not sure it claims to be. It's definitely hip-pop.Don't be discouraged by the people writing reviews saying they sold out or that the CD is crap. I think everyone is way too intense about music. If it makes you happy for three and a half minutes so you don't have to think about all of the stress and pain in the world, well then the music has done it's job. It's light-hearted and fun and it makes me smile when I listen. I hope it does for you too. Enjoy!"
5,awesome lyrics and sound,This cd was actually better then their last one! I love it! Their sound is the same as their last cd! I would highly reconmend it if you were into their last cd! It was cool to hear fergies voice on all the songs! My husband even likes it and we never aggree on music!
3,ITS COOL,ive go tthe album on right now and here are my honest ratingsPump It----- could be btter but i over played it 9/10Dont phunk wit my heart -------9/10i cant really remember the rest to shout bout but my humps is totally off the chains nm really up peat........My fav song on their album is DONT LIE... its so cuteee llol dont ask em why ....
1,A message from Kari Kamiya,"The Black Eyed Peas are bad. They make it on the radio, Becuse they lame and old newsWho cares About the Lame Eyed Wees, I don't"
1,"Monkey Business-Yeah, that's ALL it is","I'm not really a hip hop fan, though some of the BEPs older songs like ""Where is the Love"" were okay, pretty catchy, not bad.But once I heard this album, I convinced that so-called hip hop/pop is going down the drain. The rappers really can't rap, and Fergie doesn't sing- she wines. As far as ""My Humps"" goes, some people say that this song is just a joke, but from every thing I've heard, I don't think so. It just junks up radio stations and is highly annoying. As far as the video, I applaud them for keeping their clothes on. Why anyone would spend money on this crap is still a mystery to me. At least their title is quite fitting."
2,Horrible album,"This CD is probably the worst one The Black Eyed Peas had ever made. Most of the tracks are really annoying and there are only about three good songs in the album (two of them very good). So, in my opinion this album is only for Black Eyed Peas fans."
1,More Corporate Product,"I thought that when I stopped listening to radio stations, I could avoid the slick, soulless, meaningless music product that is popular music these days. But it's impossible. I've just seen the Black Eyed Peas yet again on my TV--this time plugging either Whoppers or cell phones, I don't know--so there's really no escape.Since I now have to see them as well as hear them, I've noticed one thing: the Black Eyed Peas are a straight version of the B-52s."
3,Half and half,"1. Pump It - A-: Great song but the beginning is stupid.2. Don't Phunk With My Heart - A: Great song, doesn't get old?3. My Style - C-: Filler4. Don't Lie - A+: My favorite on the CD.5. My Humps - D+: Way too desperate for lyrics.6. Like That - F: Just stupid.7. Dum Diddly - F: ^^^8. Feel It - D-: My ears cracked from Fergie in the beginning I couldn't finish it.9. Gone Going - A+: Great song, Jack sounds great in here. And everyone hates it??10. They Don't Want Music: B+: Great group here, a little repetitive.11. Disco Club - C: No comment12. Bebot - A+: Good but it's in what language???13. Ba Bump - D: Okay.....14. Audio Delite At Low Fidelity - D+: Not a delite at all.15. Union - F: Boring!Overall: C - really half of the CD could have been cut off and I wouldn't have cared"
5,I love this CD,"The music allows me to lose myself from my usual stick the mud kind of self and I get to be free when I play it. Great beat, great rhythm, great music period!"
4,Fun!,This is just a fun CD. It makes you want to dance.We listen to this in the Operating Room and it makes the atmosphere less tense.
3,Not their best but definately a few catchy tunes!,"Ok, I'd probably be the last person to buy this cd but I bought it because of their first single ""Don't Phunk With My Heart."" I bought it today and I realized I was better off downloading the songs I liked, but nonethless, its a catchy cd.It seems to me that this album has awesome beats, but horrible lyrics and melodies. While I listened to it, I found myself writing my own songs from the beats and I believe I did a better job. So I give this cd 3 stars for the instrumental beats, but the lyrics and singing just stink. BUT, there are 4 songs on here that I could jam to all night long...Pump It- This is just a head bobber.Don't Phunk With My Heart- The reason I bought the cd.My Humps- One of the most catchy songs I've EVER heard...I love it.Bebot- This reminds me of Nina Sky's ""Move Your Body"" but I like it.Overall, they had a good start with the rythms but they could've taken a bit more time to write the actual music and such."
5,Really Really Good,"I Really Liked This One cuz it had a really good style through it and alot of awesome mind blowing songs, I thought it was better than the first one."
3,I don't know what to say...,"Except this album is very mixed. It has a lot of great tracks, but the cd itself is a little wierd. A lot of the beats are very good and there are a lot of different influences on their sound, but what I don't get is why they have songs like My Humps and Don't Phunk with my Heart. They have one song on the album called Like That and it is just amazing. They have Q Tip, Talib Kweli, C Lo, and John Legend all on the track and is easily my favorite on the whole cd. I think that lyrically, BEP could improve, but for right now this cd will hold me for a little while. However, I would recommend that you look elsewhere for long lasting music."
1,BEP sold their souls to the Industry Devil.,"I remember when Black Eyed Peas made meaningful, inspiring music. I guess that wasn't making them enough money, so they add a hot white chic and pour some water in their musical ingredients. BEP give true meaning to the word sell-out. What the hell won't they endorse? Truly one of the biggest disappointments in rap music."
1,Crud,"What this embodies is the souless, vain, idiotic, and materialistic american today. The fact somebody would listen to this and have actually understood the lerics... then listen to it again makes me sad for them. Buy this if you want to be like everyone else, boring, unoriginal and of course hip. This music is crud. If you have to have a song, download it, because giving these people your money should be a crime."
3,My what mainstream can do,"This group was so much better during its underground and grass root stage. This album was a decent blend of wild, and energetic music that has always been around.The popular songs were merely NBA Hype sounds and SportsCenter music fillers.All the loyal B.E.P. fans will tell you that the songs everyone rants about are there worst and the ones that got the bad reviews were what put fans in the crowd before all the exposure. Loyal fans are starved out while fluffy headed band wagon jumpers destroy a sound that was truly the truth.Mainstream groupies make you hot and then they drop you like worn underwear in the dirty close basket. If you like No Doubt,Christina Agullerra and that brand go for it this is so for you dude."
5,A fun mixed bag.,"This album reminds me of the diverse, mass appeal that the No Doubt album that came in mid-90's. Just like that album, its diverse and experimental. It definitely defies any genre. Easy to listen to for a person who finds the constant drone of base nervewracking. It's smooth and relaxing for some songs, touching and personal for others...then casually uses the F word in tracks that make for dancing about the house. Good Buy."
3,Monkey Business...is just that.,"The first two songs are strong!!!(Pump it and Don't Phunk with my Heart) Adding Fergie has been a big plus for the group. ""My Style is not bad, but ""my humps"" is stupid and juvenile. ""They don't want the music"" with James Brown and ""Union"" with Sting are okay. Someone smarter than me please explain ""bebot"". ""Like that"" ""Dum Diddly"" and ""Feel it"" are better than average. The group has traveled around the world and is trying to please all...so you end up with an ""okay"" album."
1,You Call Those Lyrics?,"I can't believe what I have heard from this album, it is just gross! If you don't know what I mean just go on google and look up the lyrics to ""My Humps"", it's actually disturbing! It's so stupid, I'm seriously thinking they are kind of acting like the devil (metaphorically). First of all, the songs have catchy tunes and sound great... until you actually listen. The lyrics are lyrics no one should have to listen to and they draw you into their music by the tempting tunes, and then you are listening to garbage, it's horrible."
1,terrible,"Yeah, I liked the Black Eyed Peas until I heard 'My Humps'. I have completely lost respect for them. Nothing like nonsensical main stream hiphop crap. Goodbye to the good old Black Eyed Peas, and say hello to the new main stream crap that only ignorant grade school children will listen to because it sounds just like the rest of the hiphop crap out there black eyed peas."
1,To add fergie= big mistake,"Black eyed peas lost all respect for themselves when they got desperate and decided to add a girl in vocals. They went from rap to pop and the backing vocals became the lead singer and the music to appealing to suburban soccer moms. For real rap pick up some Notorious BIG, Nas, @pac and the Death Row albums."
4,"A very listenable album, BEP has changed into something else...","I bought the the first BEP album way back in the day, and every subsequent album. Sure they're more popular now, they added Fergie and their sound is more poppy, but its still the same BEP. This is a very enjoyable album and I'm glad I bought it. The haters out there need to lighten up."
1,what have they become...,"alright, don't get me wrong here, but the black eyed peas SUCK now a days. The guy singing most of of the lyrics voice is the most annoying voice ever not to mention the lyrics are repetitive and don't make ANY sense at all. i mean, yeah, the black eyed peas WERE good, and i used to love them with songs like where is the love, shut up and hey mama, but now it's pathetic how people are actually liking the songs. if you listened close to the songs, i'm probably sure you found that it made no sense either, which means if you like it, you're not really listening to the lyrcis, just the beats, and if you do that, you don't like the music itself do ya? you like the beats..."
2,Not as good as last time,"I got this CD because I liked the Black Eyed Peas last album, and the song Don't Phunk With My Heart. But I listened to it once, and didn't like any other songs at all. Then I listened to it again a few more times, and didn't like them anymore than I did before. Sorry guys, but this album is just kinda crappy."
5,peas are great,sorry for all you Fergie haters... but she made the band what she is today. people are hating on her saying she should be destroyed. she is one of the best singers out today. my humps is my favorite song of 2005 besides gold digger. the black eyed peas were not too good before fergie came along because they were more rap but now they are pop and they sound good. just forget anybody who says this is bad because they are people who listen to bad rap music like 50 cent and all them others. Fergie is the sh*t. go black eyed peas. monkey business is the best.
2,I don`t get it > . >,Why the heck does EVERYONE love My Humps? At school all of the kids love it. Their 10 and 11 years old! I like Don`t Phunk with my heart and Don`t lie but My Humps is just WRONG.
1,FERGIE.....AND THE OTHERS IN THE BAND,How can a group that used to be good without Fergie be so f****** bad. If you want good BEP listen to therre old s***. When they were with Eazy-E they were the best
1,to the kid who said when they were with Eazy E,"BEP never worked with Eazy E and if Eazy E and 2Pac were alive they'd kill BEP lyrically for ruining rap.Get proper rap like NWA,Eazy E and 2Pac not this fake POP music its nowhere near rap!P.S When BEP released their 1st album,(When they WERE rap) Eazy E was dead"
1,The epitome of selling out,"These guys are headed down the most awful downward spiral of any ""rap"" group in recent history. Their debut, ""Behind The Front"" was one of my favorite rap/hip-hop albums of the late 90s. ""Bridging The Gap"" was also great. ""Elephunk"" ... not so much. Now ""Monkey Business""? Are they trying to loose their fans? The only people buying this crap are pop junkies with no taste in good (rap) music. I gaurantee Amazon's not grouping their earlier albums with Britney Spears and Coldplay records. Why BEP, WHY! Avoid this crap at all costs. If you claim you like this record, than your musical opinion holds no validity. I'm guessing you base your opinions on Rolling Stone reviews. Don't even get me started on that crap!"
1,this cd sucks.,"wow. i have never written a review before and had to after i heard ""monkey business"". i didn't even make it through an entire song due to fergie's annoying pseudo-reggae wailing. i wish i could give it no stars.what a waste of money."
1,What an outrageous group!,"What an outrageous group, how can anyone like this rubbish. Maybe an horde of brainless people. How I feel happy in being intelligent ,living my life with things of absolute quality and not consuming this kind of food for mediocres. How said Romans, ""it's just bread and circus to the poors"". Give to people what they deserve, rubbish! It's because you mediocre people that buy this, that this kind of people, the members of this group, get money and laughs behind the scenes about how dumb people can be. It's the same horde that buy, Beyonce, Spears, Madona, and other outrageous poor music."
1,Awful,I never received my product from this seller. And never got a return email about my complaints.
1,don't buy,this product did work as delivered. Had to be rebuilt to work. Then the Darth Vader popped off.
4,Refurb Machine works great,"This machine works great especially as it is a refurb so I got it for half the price. It is not perfect but for a laser printer it is a great price.Printing is fast and high quality, faxing is good though takes a little time to fax out. Quality is good but g85 fax quality is a little better. I like the fact that this answers once the answer machine goes on and a fax is detected coming in.Copying is fast and good quality.Scanning is not that good quality but acceptable as it does come out a bit faint on my machine for which i do not believe their is a setting to change this.It is a little noisy as stated by others but for that price i can put up with the noise!!!!All in all well worth the refurb price for a laser AIO."
2,Don't bother with this machine,"I use my 3050 primarily as a copy machine but do receive up to 20 pages of faxes a day, without problems.When the toner that came with the machine ran out, I purchased a ""compatible"" off-brand toner cartridge. I got vertical streaks on every page I copied. I was told by HP to purchase only HP brand toner cartridges ($70 v. $25 for compatible). I still ended up with vertical lines on every page. HP insists it is the toner cartridges and had no solution.A waste of $249. I like HP printers (my workhorse 2200 is still running about about 6 years) because you don't have to buy a separate toner cartridge and image drum, but this machine is a piece of junk. I will now have to buy a more expensive HP fax/copy machine to get better quality.Not recommended!"
3,Mostly OK AIO,"We needed a new Laser Fax for office and after some research, I had decided to buy one of these 3050s. We got one and set it up as a stand alone fax. It worked ok for a while, but then we started getting random calls from our customers letting us know that the fax we sent them was just one solid black page. This only happens randomly. I contacted HP Support and after trying some of their pointless tech support tips, they finally agreed to swap out the unit. I sent that unit back and they sent me a ""new"" unit. Unfortunately, the solid black pages are still happening. Not as often, at least we are not getting as many reports of this happening, but it is still happening. I will never buy another 3050 again."
2,Skip this one...,"After less than a year in service, we have a solid line down the page on every print/copy job. Replacing the toner unit didn't work, cleaning the scan glass didn't work. HP says it must be a toner unit problem, but replacing them repeatedly is expensive - and not working. The unit is going to the garbage dump today. Poor servicability."
1,Stay Far away from the HP LaserJet 3050,What a piece of junk. Was on the phone with customer service for 3 days trying to figure out how to receive faxes. This piece of junk received faxes whenever it wanted to. Customer service never figured it out and was sent back to Amazon sans box a week later. I received a full refund even without the box and packing material.
1,Shame on HP - only printer works with Vista!!,"HP has evidently become lazy - just because most of the home computing world that buys a laptop today is forced to endure Vista (oh, I loved XP!) why on earth should HP be bothered to provide drivers that work for the scanning or faxing features of this all-in-one? BEWARE - it will print and copy but it is useless if you have Vista. Oh yes, and despite numerous calls, emails, postings on their forums...they don't respond, don't care - s*cks to be you if you bought this!"
5,HP 3050 Best value on the market,Best value for the $$$..You get the benefit of a laser with the cost of an inkjet. For a little more than 300$ you can set your office up to perform better than ever.
1,"Liked it fine, until...","I liked the printer fine -- wasn't delighted with it, but wasn't terribly unhappy either -- until I upgraded my MacBook to Mac OS X. Then I find out, unfortunately, that HP does not support full functionality for this printer under Mac OS X, and I'm far from the only one unhappy with this situation, and HP has refused to update the printer driver for provide full functionality. (See[â€¦]) for just one forum for the complaints. As a result, I would not buy this or any other HP printer again. I just can't count on it the software being updated for a decent length of time."
1,Bad news with vista - no software for scanning,"I'm the same as a few others I bought a new HP computer with Vista aka ""Junka""... and spent 4 hours one saturday trying to find out how to get software that would make the scanner work. The CD that came with the printer doesn't work with vista! How crazy, it seems the farther we advance with computers the less compatible they become... I have an HP computer and an HP printer and they don't work together, I'm so mad. I just wish that HP would at least make it easy to let you know that it's impossible to get the 3050 scanner to work with vista instead of making you run all around the internet for nothing. HP you're a junk company!"
1,hp 3050,"i want to return the HP3050 printer,because it doesn't work,it didn't suck the paper.and without all the paper trade(see the picture).it can not use even you ship the botten paper trade later,still missing 3 pieces paper trade and the light was on all the time showssomething wrong(see the picture).How should i return the printer?where & to which company? I purchesed another printer later ,can i use thatbox to return? because it doesn't come with the original box when you shipped.wait for your answer.Best Regards"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Faxes are received as bar codes. HP knows a problem exist with the formatter board but it took 4 calls to customer support for the problem to be acknowledged. To fix this under warranty HP wants to charge $50 for a refurbished copier sent overnight. I want the copier repaired at no cost at the local repair center but HP will not send the part. The part is backordered with ""no estimate ship date"". I can buy the part as an end user for $193. HP does not stand behind it's products."
1,scanning and faxing work 1/4 the time,"If you just want this for a printer, its a dandy little machine. If you want to use this for business, be prepared to fax your pages twice... because you will have to get a call from the receiving end saying ""your pages are all garbled, could you please fax again?!"". Then you either must run the ""scan hotfix"" off of the hp website or turn the machine off. This happens about 1 out of every 4 faxes or scans. You'll know when you scan something and see the horrible results. Stay away from this machine if you need it for faxing or scanning. Printing... sure. Unless, of course, HP does some sort of new software patch or driver update or something, otherwise this would be one of the quickest, best multi-function machines on the market."
1,It stops working after few uses,"I bought mine last month and used it for 10 times and now it doesnt work anymore. I went to a review board and 50% people have the same problems. So stay away from this, if you dont want to loose data."
3,Very slow with Windows XP and USB 2 port.,"Very slow (1 hour) to copy to it a folder containing 212 MB of data (5538 files, 1752 folders) with Windows XP.Zipping up the files into a single ZIP file, it can be copied in about 3 minutes. So there is an issue with the number of files/folders.This problem does not happen with Windows 2000.Reading the copied files is fast enough (about 3-4 minutes) under WinXP (or Win2000).Deleting the files under Windows XP would have taken even longer (about 2 hours), so I re-format it instead (a few seconds).This problem does not happen with Windows 2000.Thanks to a great message from ""samthewebman"" he found that re-formatting the USB drive as NTFS instead of FAT32 (default) or FAT, resolved the problem in his case (another brand of Flash Drive). I will try this tonight."
2,BEWARE! Cruzer Mini,"I bought two 256MB Cruzer Mini's in early June. On the third use, one of the memory sticks completely stopped working. I was showing some digital photos on the stick using a friend's computer when the stick just became unreadable. The green light still comes on when inserted and a drive will appear in ""my computer,"" but Windows is unable to read the stick at all. I had to send the stick away and pay $100 to have a company attempt to recover my files.I have used two other brands of USB memory sticks in the past for long periods of time with no issues. I can't recommend buying the Sandisk 256MB Cruzer Mini."
2,"Convenient, small, all scratched up","We have the 256 MB and 128 MB versions of this product. First, the lanyard only works with a neck-strap so I took an older lanyard that hooks to my keychain. I don't know anyone who puts a jump drive around their neck. Second, the housing of the unit is scratched and pitted after only two weeks' use. Third, it gets really hot when it's in use. Not sure about that last one. Anyway if you can get this cheap, and you don't mind buying a new one next year, then go for it. Otherwise I recommend the Lexar versions whose housing takes the damage a bit more and will actually clip directly onto your keychain."
1,Mysteriously Frozen.,"I used this twice, successfully, transferring MP3s between my Mac G4 and my newer iMac. Then the clip just stopped recognizing files... it powers on - the light turns green... and then nothing... it's like it's blocking any files from being dragged onto it. I can't drag any files into it on either computer. If anyone knows how to fix this problem, I'd appreciate it."
5,Good price,"I had originally bought the same product at Best Buy for about double the price, then searched online and found everything was much cheaper. Plus, this one came with two different colored caps to make it somewhat stylish. Haven't had any problems yet!"
4,Cruzer Mini,"Haven't really used this that much but is nice to have around, can't think of why it wouldn't be good."
3,hasn't broken - yet,"its a good product as far as these things go. Its a little on the flimsy side, and its pretty small. Honestly, I got it because a) I'd been thinking about one for a while, and b) I wanted free shipping on something else. What a great marketing strategy, huh?Anyway, I use the thing daily, and it works, its fast, its kind of on the small side, and don't expect the latch where you attach the necklace thing to stand up to any sort of real pressure. It'll snap off in no time."
5,life for older computers,"another drive I purchased to transport data from my original "" blueberry"" I-Mac; actually anything up to 1 gigabyte will work; I had to learn this the hard way and purchase a 4GB and a 2GB both of which aren't recognized by this machine...............sbgale"
2,3rd Time's a Charm?,"I'm on my 3rd Cruzer Mini now, after one died and cannot be recognized after 3 months of use, and its replacement gave me the ""Insert Disk"" message that other people have seen.Hits: small, slim design, fits in tight spaces, needs only LOW power and can be chained off an USB Hub. Good RMA policy & tracking process, though my first replacement was slow in coming, but the 2nd came in decent time. It comes with replacement plastic caps should you lose the original, though the replacments are just as easy to lose.Misses: Silly necklace-thing that came with it, durability & long-term reliability. We'll see how long this will last. Performance is lower than some competitors.Take Away: We'll see whether the Cruzer will outlast its warranty or not. SanDisk probably lost money on me with the holiday rebate and the 2 RMAs thus far.Advice to all: whether you have this or any other USB Flash Drive, MAKE BACKUPS!!!"
1,Don't use CruzerLock !!,"The Cruzer Mini 256 works fine, but I got in the following problem : I tested the CruzerLock software and I forgot the password. Even if you erase everything on the card, the password is not erased. According to Sandisk technical support, the password is stored in a secure area and you need the old one to retrieve it. So, if you forget your password, you will NEVER be able to use the protection ! How nice ."
3,Good but SanDisk Micro is better,Works great but form and design could use some improvement. I originally wanted a flash drive that I could put on my keychain and this one in particular was not designed to do that. For portability it's bascially an in your pocket or wear around your neck type. I ended up getting the SanDisk Cruzer Micro which is smaller and better suited for the keychain. Advertisments for SanDisk's costly upgrades are annoying also.
5,LOVE this little thing!,"I bought this to save all the personal stuff on my computer at work as I was leaving a job. This thing is SO cool. It's about as big as a pack of gum but holds TONS of information. Also nice so that it will fit in between other things plugged into the back of your machine. As soon as you plug it in, the software automatically pops up on your computer screen and allows easy drag and drop. What could be simpler?"
2,Excellent at first...,"I love these new drives. I have a total of three, currently, all from various companies. The Sandisk served me well for the first few months. Of course, there were the occassional corrupted files, but that even happens on floppies - so there's no big deal. Then, one day, my disk completely stopped working on me. I'm still waiting for a response from their support team. Overall, the Sandisk is a good buy, but it runs the risk of dying. However, I don't plan on buying another one of these from this company. One death is more than enough - I'll stick with my Jumpdrive, thank you!"
2,"Worthless, Waste of Time, Unreliable","Out of the box, it worked approximately a quarter of the time on the same computer (iBook OSX). Same thing occured on other computers (PCs). Complete waste of money and time trying to deal with it. Scandisk costumer support was worthless, giving pre-made information from a similar questions and it still did not work. Don't by Scandisk."
2,Not a reliable,"The device worked for two weeks and stop working in a sudden. I lost all the files saved on this disk. If I have to buy another one, I wouldn't buy SanDisk."
1,Simply unreliable,"This USB drives worked for me for no more than three hours: I wrote two files at my office (Mac OS 10.2.7) to this media. I could read and rewrite while in office. However, three hours later when I tried to work on these files on my home computer (Mac OS 9.2). Well, it was not working any more. I then came back to my office and tried it again. Guess what, error messages came up, including ""low power"", ""not recognized by Mac OS X"", and ""some information may have lost"". The unit was sent back to the retailer immediately."
1,Absolutely Horrible Product!,"My cruzer died after 1 month. Luckily I did not have any important documents in it. After reading all the other negative reviews, I will never ever buy one again. I have contacted Sandisk about getting it fixed or getting a new one. Still waiting ... I am still in the market for another (non-Sandisk) flash drive."
2,S l oooooooo on Win Xp compared to others....,"Great little device, Read speed ok (just ok) butWrite speed on Win Xp really bad - like super sloooooow....And delete, like 6 minutes to delete 12 meg of files on it!!!As some one else mentioned theres no problems on Win 2000, in fact its rather zippy, but Win Xp and this thing has a problem. Some friends have IBM and Kingston devices like this one - and they beat me to death, my sanDisk is SAD in comparison...Its a bummer.."
3,Cap falls off easily,"This flash drive is excellent, like all flash drives I have tried. It is a wonderful alternative to floppy drives, and it allows me to move large files around easily. My complaint - I carry the drive around in my purse, and although the cap starts out snug fitting, after taking it off and putting it on a few dozen times, the cap now falls off easily. I also have a Sony MicroVault, and I sure paid a premium for it, but it is so well designed that there is no way the cap can fall off - it snaps snugly into place. Verdict - I won't buy another SanDisk drive until they redesign the casing."
1,Nice when it works,"Purchased first through Amazon.com. Failed to work after the first week. Spent 5 weeks waiting on a new one from SanDisk (who were very easy to deal with). Received second drive which failed after a week. Received third 5 weeks later which, too failed. Have gone with different product. Recommend you do the same."
5,Great USB Drive,"I've had my SanDisk cruzer for a year and a half now, and have never experienced a single problem. It has worked with every computer I have ever tried. I use it for school, mostly word, PP, and excel files so I don't need that much space. However, recently I purchased a new computer and it was incredibly helpful in gettign all my files trasfered.It is very durable, no scratches after all this time. Once I even accidently send it through the washing machine. Afterwards I let it dry for a couple of days, and it worked just fine. Not that I would want to repeat that.One negative point . . . the cap begins to crack after a couple months of use making the fit not as tight. It does come with two extra caps, but if you've been using one for as long as I have that's not enough.Overall, a great product . Once you buy one, it will be hard to believe that you could ever live without it. I take mine everywhere."
3,"All the function , none of the physical","Ive had this drice a while now.It functions exactly how it should though, physically it comes up short.It comes with 3 differnt color caps, but not for fashion, but becuase they fall off and get lost.Also, it did come with a nifty necklace tie, but as luck would have it, the plastic that holds the string soon snapped off, rendering it sort of useless.Shop around and at least you can get it for a good price as I did."
2,Not so Mac friendly,"Unlike other flash drives I have bought, this one seems buggy with the Mac and doesn't like many of the files I try to drag into it. Unsure why. It rejected some folders that had very simple names, such as 'open invoices,' but would copy all the files inside. Not useless, but enough of a bother that I would not recommend this to anyone with a Mac.Also, the added value applications are all executables. I didn't want them anyway, but not being *able* to use them is different than not *wanting* to use them.Unsure how hard it is to make a flash drive that's plug and play for Mac, but other drive manufacturers seemed to have mastered this trick."
4,cruzer mini usb 2.0 at work,"The Cruzer Mini is an ideal and affordable solution instead of using several floppy's or R/CD's. In my line of work I move around alot and need to copy and change files on the run. The 256 MB flash drive is more than enough to handle all my txt files, my pics and small programs. I wear the flash drive around my neck so I have my hands free and, if needed, I can plug it in any computer (almost any :) computer) around to do my work. For larger files it is not handy, but than, for an average user it is worth the money. No more (damaged) floppy's, no more searching for the right floppy in a sea of floppy's, everything on one flash drive - alot of floppy's."
3,Not suitable for keychain use,It's fast and great but it gets scratched up immediately if you put it on your keychain. These come with a lanyard but I'm not sure who would be wearing it around his neck. The best place to put this would be with your security badge for work but I prefer to carry it on the keychain.
4,This is a good product.,This sandisk realy works to save a lot of information in one stick. It's very handy. Thank you.
3,Does what it's supposed to but...,"I bought this product to replace my original 8MB IBM DiskonKey which I really enjoyed. I have two issues with the Cruzer Mini. The first is that it must be the only item plugged into a USB port. My Mac has a port that comes off the keyboard but does not have one on the front of the machine. The other complaint is minor, the housing of this item feels flimsy and the lanyard connection really does not support placing it on a keyring. Even if I were to rig it up to carry on my keyring I would be afraid it would get too badly beaten up."
3,SanDisk Cruzer Mini 256 MB,"Pleased with the item. It works well, very fast. It is everything I was led to believe."
2,Failed after 3 month,"I bought this device 3 month ago and it worked fine until today. My Win 2000 PC stopped recognizing the drive and Win XP machine displayed an error ""Hardware Malfunction"". I tried it in 5 different computers, same problem.I called SanDisk and they sent me a pre-paid FedEx label to ship it back. They promised to send me a new one, but my data is lost. I heard about poor quality of SanDisk products and I experience it myself.I gave this product 2 stars for a nice design and good customer service."
1,Don't buy this product!!!!!,"My disk worked for 2 months and then stopped. After calling their help/tech number, I was informed that it was a goner. I now have to send it back to them and they will send me another one. In short, I am very angery. This thing was promised to be the answer for all my failed disks/zips. It is just as, if not more, unreliable.Think of it: There are 14 reviews of this product. Three claim failure. Can we conclude that one out of every 5 fails? Probably!"
3,Mini Cruzer,"It's a good product but less then I have expected from it.It downloads my stuff quickly and without problems but sometimes it is not recognized by the computer and that can be very annoying, esspecially when you need to download something urgently and it just won't work!!!Good but could of been better"
1,"got stuck in various machine, not buy it","It works fine in my own laptop but got stuck in more than five other machine I use in other places. In the beginning I had thought it was because of the poor design of USB port in some computer, but I asked my friend to try his memory drive and everything works fine in his (a different brand). So I don't recommend it to you because the main function of a flash drive is help you to work on different machine. If it only works in some machine and you will never know whether the machine you are working is good to it or not, I think it has no use."
2,It's handy...when it works,"I loved it for a month. I was very careful about ejecting it properly and the whole bit. After one month all my files started becoming corrupted. Luckily I had already backed up everything. Hopefully they will refund me, or send me a brand new, more reliable one.argh."
1,Review of purchase!!!!!!!!!!!,I have already rated it. I was very disappointed as it said BLUE and the only reason to order was BLUE and they came and all white!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They are still in the box and have never used any of them. FALSE ADVERTISING as I stated several weeks ago!
4,IAmazing.!?!,"Mr. Gira, His is a history to follow and understand. Too much history to offer in this review. To see them live is beyond compare."
3,LOVE Twinings Earl Grey..... but,"We love getting this by the case since we drink so much of it. However, the last case showed up and about 90% of all the bags were not ""stuffed"" and folded closed properly. Resulting in massive amounts of tea spilling out. Not the end of the world. you could just stuff the bag into a tea ball and that would get you by. We resorted to shaking all the tea to the side of the bag that was folded closed properly and rolling up the edge and winding the string around it to keep it that way while steeping. Again, not the end of the world but an annoyance. If the next case shows up like this I think we'll send it back. But I don't know who to request to make good on it; Amazon or Twinings"
1,Twinings Earl Grey Tea,Arrived on schedule. I order decaffinated and they sent caffinated. Good tea either way.
5,Good Tea for the Price,"People who know tea know that Twinings puts out a great product. It's what the Queen drinks, so if it's good enough for her, it's good enough for me. Great Tea, good flavor, good price."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TEA!,"It is not the Wonderful Twinings Earl Grey you have come to know and love. They have pulled a ""new coke"" blunder and now the best Earl Grey tea ever is available no more! This tea is weak and tasteless.I hate stupidity, especially from corporate marketers."
1,"Bergamont ""flavor"" makes this a bad Earl Grey","For a great Earl Grey at reasonable price, try Culinary Circle Earl Grey sold at Shaws supermarkets. I love Earl Grey,but it has to have a good strong flavor and aroma of Bergamot which is only found in teas that have Bergamot oil as an ingredient. Twinings Earl Grey teabags have ""Bergamot flavor"" (not Bergamot oil and most likely less expensive). It has a fake, almost bland flavor and aroma. Might as well buy straight black tea it is much less expensive."
1,The most taste-less Earl Grey ever,"I love drinking tea, and Earl Grey has been my choice everywhere I go. I enjoyed brewing tea from tea leaves, a habit that I have given up for the ease of tea bags. Twinings tea had always been my pick until this last purchase from Amazon. Earl Grey totally lost its poignancy. Even two bags of tea could not brew a decent cup of tea.At first I thought it was the recent degradation of Earl Grey tea as a result of climate change etc. Then I tasted other brand's Earl Grey and found acceptable. I went to the length and bought another pack of Twining Earl Grey tea from a grocery store, and I tasted alright. So I can only conclude the tastelessness of Twinings Earl Grey is associated with packages I bought from Amazon.I found this to be true with Amazon's Darjeeling tea as well."
1,Earl Grey Tea,My tea came after three weeks and it was only one pack instead of six. I called and complained and the following week got another one pack instead of six. That is all I ever received and my money was refunded. Don't really know what happened...never got an explanation from the distributor.
2,Ruined a good thing!,"Have been drinking Twinings Earl Gray for the last 10 years or so. However the last batch from Amazon was so mild and lacking the flavor that I had grown to love, that it was almost bland. Do not know how genuine the report on Wikipedia is, but it seems Twininigs, in their infinite wisdom has tweaked the original formula in April 2011. Going by my experience, it sounds about right.Sad when a company has to tweak a great and well loved flavor, and still sell it as 'classic'.I will not be ordering it, till they bring back the original 'classic'Shame Twinings.Update: And just so you folks know..Twinings had said that they would send me a pack direct, to make up for my dissatisfaction. It is over 3 months and I am still waiting. I will not hold my breath. Looks like they changed their customer service formula too!"
3,A 'light' black tea,Upon ordering this tea I thought it would be a strong and dark earl grey. Instead I received a tea that is very bland and in order to improve on the flavor I have to double up on my bags.This tea is about half as strong as Bigelow's earl grey blend.
2,CAVEAT EMPTOR! TEA LACKS FULL FLAVOR!!!!!,"It's not the regular, strong Earl Grey Twinings I come to love. This version lacks strength and flavor - two teabags are needed for regular strength tea. It's even states on the box - Light Flavour Strenght (2 leaves out of five). Beware!"
1,"Bland, Bland tea - Very Disappointed","I used my first tea from this large order this morning (50-COUNT BOXES, 6 PACK). It is awfully bland. I thought I was getting a good deal - but not if I can't stand to drink it. I wish I had listened to several reviewers who advised that Twinings had changed their blend of tea. I loved my Twinings Earl Grey Tea. I now have read on the Internet that Twinings changed their blend of tea for the Earl Grey blend. The company claims it was only for the UK market, but I find that very hard to believe after drinking this cup of tea and reading many other reviews. I will never buy another box of Twinings Earl Grey tea. I will try other brands. I will write to Twinings and see if they send me a coupon for another blend. Very disappointed!!!"
2,New earl grey flavor is not good,"I didn't realize this until after drinking my first cup and some googling but apparently Twinnings altered their Earl Grey formula in April 2011 and has added more citrus flavor. I agree with the mob of Brits upset with this change, the lemon taste now is overpowering. Try some other brand if you really want Earl Grey. If you have a really strong lemon tea then go ahead and buy this stuff."
1,Awful and peppery flavored,Never again. Almost made me loose my taste for it. Just bitter pepper flavor. Will try another brand. Ick wish I hadn't bought lrg box
5,Earl Grey Tea,This is the best Earl Grey Tea I have found. I use Earl Grey for iced tea instead of the traditional general black tea. The price on Amazon is awesome.
3,No Eagles?,"Real quick, if it doesn't have ""Hotel California"" or ""New Kid In Town"" it doesn't represent 1977."
3,Worth at least half the money,"Not too bad for a hard techno compilation. Something I do keep with my collection and play on techno nights. ""Blood is Pumping"" is a playable track. A lot like Darude's ""Sandstorm"". The Junkfood Junkies track is good as well. A lot of the songs on this CD mix a little light rap with techno (""Like This Like That"", ""Big Bass Bomb""), and some seem to have R&B beats and riffs/stabs (""Off""). The Zombie Nation track is playable as well. Everything else, eh. Probably worth half of what I paid for it."
4,its an amazin C.D,i enjoyed listenin to this cd .. its amazin the beats from these song's .. i really like this cd and i really recomemded to anyone that likes techno music that has a little kick to it by that i mean the lyrics .. i know that sometimes the lyrics are a little bit outta hand but it makes it more exciting but thats my opininon about this cd .. and i hope that other people that buy this cd is gonna like it too ..so listen to it and see what i mean
4,there all good song's,i enjoyed listenin to this cd .. its amazin that beats from these song's .. i really like this cd and i really recomemded to anyone that likes techno music that has a little kick to it by that i mean that lyrics .. i know that sometimes the lyrics are a little bit outta hand but it makes it more exciting but thats my opininon about this cd .. and i hope that other people that buy this cd is gonna like it too ..
3,Stunning Necklace But...,"I bought this as a present for myself because it reminds me of the love between a mother and daughter. However, I have had to superglue the cameo back to the frame twice and I havent even had it that long. I love my necklace but I expect a little more if Im paying over $40.00 for a necklace"
1,poor quality do not order,"This dvd is very poor quality,i just recieved mine today and i am sending it back tommorrow,you get your money worth,but the quality is poor,the dvd is real blurry,don't waste your time ordering it."
5,Great purchase!!,I ordered this jacket and received it in about 3 days which was much faster than I expected. The jacket was exactly as pictured so I am thrilled with the purchase. I thought the price was excellent for the quality jacket that I received. I would highly recommend this jacket as a great combination of quality and cost.
5,Excellent CD!,"This CD is a great selection of 1984 hits! If you miss 80s music, this CD is a must-have! Buy it!"
2,Enough already,"[....] Give us a break. Trot out the same old trance anthems again and try to look innocent as you collect the dough. Please, show some originality and pick a track that might be new to people's collections, instead of the same set of tunes cleverly arranged in a different order. Folks, do yourselves a favor and go for something from the Renaissance series, the Global Underground series or one of Gatecrasher's CDs."
4,Straight Up Awesome Music,"O.K., so I will take away one star because, as several reviewers agree, most of these tracks have flooded the trance-anthem CD scene, and are older. Oh well, as this is a pretty well-mixed collection of many great grooves. I found this to contain many of my favorite 'mood' tracks from various Global Underground and Northern Exposure (Sasha/Digweed) CDs. This is definately a good choice for someone starting to build a trance music collection, and a good buy for those with established collections who would enjoy a ""best of"" CD."
2,Party like it's....1998?,"'Ere we go, another new release intended to ""show the Americans"" what's ""new"" in dance music. Judging by the tune selection it would appear to be early 1999. If you thought Oakenfold's ""Tranceport"" was anthemic, Dave ""the Wave"" Dresden has a surprise for you!""Xpander."" ""For An Angel."" ""Out of the Blue."" ""Three Drives."" This makes Ministry compilations look positively underground! I could have stomached this barrage of anthems two years ago, but so much has happened in dance music, why do releases like this keep coming out and re-hashing the same old things? Two stars -- because two years ago, these tunes WERE enjoyable. Enough already. [sigh]."
1,Rantings of a Bigot,"Much of this book is an opportunity for Forman, a self-described liberal, to abandon tolerance and not merely criticize, but express his deep hatred for those with whom he disagrees. Fortunately, I didn't buy this book; instead I read it at the home of an unfortunate person who did."
5,Classic country.,"This group of hits from 1962 includes five number one hits,the other five tracks landed in the top five.The track listing, with the artist.1. 'Wolverton mountain' -- Claude King.2. 'Devil woman' -- Marty Robbins.3. 'She thinks I still care' -- George Jones.4. 'She's got you' -- Patsy Cline.5. 'I've been everywhere' -- Hank Snow.6. 'Adios Amigo' -- Jim Reeves.7. 'Crazy' -- Patsy Cline.8. 'Old Rivers' -- Walter Brennan.9. 'P.T. 109' -- Jimmy Dean.10. 'Don't go near the Indians' -- Rex Allen.There's some great classic tracks here.Patsy Cline songs never go out of style.Walter Brennan's, 'Old Rivers' can bring a lump in your throat,and I've never grown tired of 'Wolverton mountain'.All original recording from Rhino/Wea in 1990."
3,"Nice, but typical","Nice stuff, very Middle Eastern style which shows the strong Arab influence in northern and eastern African music. But it's quite typical as well. One review said Mursal is ''right up there'' with Baba Maal etc but I disagree, I think she's nowhere near the power, range and sensitivity of Baba Maal or indeed Selif Keita. Still, she's good, and maybe she'll get there."
2,A disappointing experience..,It is unfortunate that only a couple of tracks on this album actually feature african/arabic instrumentation and style. Like so many of global fusion recordings that there is a big danger of failure when the electic instruments are used. it's a big shame that Maryam's talent is wasted on this album and couldn't have been recorded with some real Somali instruments and musicians. The sound of keyboards and the fiddle with their long musical introductions is of very bad taste! I am truely disappointed and hopefully other Somali singers will stay more true to the beautiful sounds of authetic Somali music and not be tempted to make some horrible fusion with celtic or any other european instruments. Somethings were not meant to be mixed and I think this is true for keyboards (or bass guitars) and african music. Especially when there are such charming instruments like the oud to accompany with.
3,Mursal is good but.....,"Mohammed Suleiman is the only singer that all Somalis unanimously crowned to be the best singer in all of Somalia. The man has no equal and once you hear his golden voice you will definitely agree! He is a legend among us Somalis and he has been singing over half a century. Unfortunately it is very hard to get his records outside of Somalia. Don't misunderstand me please, Mursal is good but compared to the KING she is just an average singer. Viva Mohammed Suleiman!"
3,Interesting!,"As a cultural geographer one of the things that I love doing is being able to listen to music from various countries. I came into contact with this album at a time when I was doing extensive research on Somali culture. It came to a surprise. I bought the album not knowing anything about the music or the singer herself. I just wanted to be able to listen to the Somali language and hear authentic Somali music.The music took time for me to get used to. I have come to appreciate this album. It is very intresting and for someone that knows nothing of this unique culture, The Journey gives you a little taste of the sounds and culture of Somalia."
4,Beautiful Music,"I love this album. I've had it for years. When I first got it, I played the heck out of it. Then it went into cold storage for a long time. Now it's back. Lei Lei and Fejingo are fantastic tunes, full of fire and grace. But whatever happened to Maryam Mursal? There is only this one album by her that I can find and that is a sad state of affairs."
1,You have to see this movie to believe it.,"I'm only giving it one star, so people don't think I believe that this movie is actually good. It's just really bad good in a ""I can't believe a bunch of people got together and spent time making this"" sort of way. Cheesy creature, lame actors, non-sensical plot, this movie has all the criteria for a B-movie. The lead girl is pretty sassy, and the main black guy is hilarious (again in a bad way). I rented this, and had to bring my friends in to watch it because I couldn't believe my eyes."
3,The Master at work,"It is always a pleasure seeing the worlds greatest drummer play. The only problem with this video is that his playing although great in it is not by any means a true representation of the unique, special & unmatched fire that Buddy Rich was blessed with. Certains things in life are unexplainable, Buddy's gift is one of them. This video does'nt show that, although it is very enjoyable."
5,LOVE,I absolutely love this frame. It looks very right and eloquent. I bought a few of these frame in different sizes and have not been disappointed.
3,Ordinary Mysticism,"The author has made an honest effort to bring mysticism within the grasp of the ""ordinary"" reader. He has made a thorough study of Medieval mystics in many of his other books (I also read Union with Christ, and very hard going, compared to this one). With that as his background, he takes the time to let you know that he is a seeker as well, and explains how he came to discover the mystics and their relevance to today's problems and society. I recommend this book."
4,Billboard Top Hits: 1979,"I bought the cd just for that one song you cannot find anywhere else. Randy VanWarmer, Just When I Needed You Most. You cannot find this one anywhere, unless you have it on an old record."
5,INCREDIBLE,Absolutely one of the greatest summations of music ever to be recorded on a single disk. Buy it.
2,A misleading follow-up....,"For anyone who has heard Garcia's Euro-Reggae single, ""Kalimba De Luna"", you would be inclined to think that this group is a gonna be a big Euro-dance factory....however, I bought the ""Imagine"" single under this impression and, man, was I disappointed. Let me explain - this is not a bad song....it's just not a dance song. It is a lite Euro-pop, almost ballad. Mediocre song, but it's gonna go with the other CD's I never listen to."
3,Poor Eeyore,"Bought Eeyore for my girlfriend, and love having him around. Just didnt like the poor stitching in his back. Had a hole in him already, poor Eeyore."
4,We have loved it,"We got this for my sons last birthday, when he turned 4. He has really loved it. He builds all sorts of things. It really allows room for creativity. I have given the kid k'nex sets to other kids his age for their birthdays and have gotten lots of big thank yous from the moms. I also have a 2 yr daughter and she likes to play with this toy too. I think it is a great toy for the money. And the different sets really get your kids making something new to play with."
4,The Kid Knex series for 3-7 year olds is a hit!,"The Rollin Rovers, Bug Eyed Buddies, Footed Friends, and the ... ones that come in a Lego Bionicle-like container are worth the money. My four year old son got all of them (some duplicates) and they are all in a bin together for more creativity. Even his older siblings 7 and 9 like to play this. Great hand-eye coordination. The cases are ok, but difficult for the age to use, so we dumped them in a bin with easy lid for him. Great idea for the age group to get them interested in older Lego and Kinex building projects/toys."
5,wonderful journey into unresolvable mystery,Involving from the very start.I literally could not put this book down.Finished it in one day even though I had intended to take it on a flight the next .The fact that the story is unproveable doesnt detract from the fun.
2,Geraldo Does the Papacy!,"The legend of Pope Joan is worth a good book. Was there a female pope and, if so, how could she have deceived all the people at least some of the time? If she is a legend, why did the legend start and why did it persist for so long? Stanford's not the man for this. He's another self-absorbed 20th century reporter type who keeps inserting himself into the story and talking down to the reader. Sometimes I thought I was reading his resume's account of his journalistic & research abilities. One of these abilities is not reflection, which is notably absent in this book. What is present is a wishful pushing of his arguments, which hurts his case more than helps it. As the Kirkus reviewer notes, he turns suppositions into facts. Disappointing book."
3,Assumptions,"I thought the history of Pope Joan was a fascinating topic. I went into reading the book with a very open mind on the subject. After reading the book, there appears to be the possibility that a female pope existed but my opinion was not swayed to one side or the other. I wish the author would have done a better job in presenting his research on the subject. I feel that he made some assumptions that were not challenged by the author. I was taught that it is okay to make assumptions as long as you go back and prove that the assumption has evidence to support it better. I do not feel that the author did a good job of it. I found that I got lost many times trying to follow the author's argument that a female pope existed. I found him throwing different references about and not tying them together well enough to agree or disagree with him. The subject as I said is fascinating and I would be interested in finding a more definitive account - pro or con."
2,Too many threads,"Did a woman ever become Pope under false pretenses? Peter Stanford says it happened. And I may even concur with his assessment of the historical evidence. Given the darkness of the age, anything is possible.What is on to make of it? Not much, I'm afraid. The problems start when the author wants to use this factoid to discuss deeper issues involving the Catholic Church: The pretension of direct descent from Christ, the role of tradition, the role of women. All of these subjects are best discussed on their merits, not through the distorting lens of the reception history of a woman Pope.Good in flight entertainment. Several factual errors..."
5,Quiet Storm,"With all that is mundane in a senseless music industry there comes a time when a album comes about that makes one sit down and listen, listen to it for what it's worth. Every cling of the guitar, swoosh of atmosphere pushed out by methodical drummming, bass lines that bleed narcotics, and a voice that could gently whisper you pains which, till then, you never knew existed. All this is intrinsic to this album with nothing more and nothing less. This album is good and the music is stunning to the point in which I asked myself ""What is this other stuff I've been listening to?""... :)"
5,Irascible-Quiescence,"With all that is mundane in a senseless music industry there comes a time when a album comes about that makes one sit down and listen, listen to it for what it's worth. Every cling of the guitar, swoosh of atmosphere pushed out by methodical drummming, bass-lines that bleed narcotics, and a voice that could gently whisper you pains which, till then, you never knew existed. All this is intrinsic to this album with nothing more and nothing less. This album is good and the music is stunning to the point in which I asked myself ""What the hell is this other stuff I've been listening to?""... :)"
2,a lot of pretense and very little sincerity,"even after listening to this cd 3 times, as suggested by the previous reviewer, i still didnt like it at all. al this brooding, whispering, semi-gothic pretense started to irritate me after a while. so i turned to the black heart procession for some consolation.... their 3 cd's give me exactly what i wanted to get from calla: genuine heartbreaking, chilling, music that stays with you for a long time. calla failed to provide these qualities"
2,I've got a headache THIS big!,"This book gave me a headache! The whole thing feels like it was written during business travel or while gulping down lunch. It raises a lot of interesting points but never seems to tie them together into a cohesive argument, or even series of arguments. Anything that can be made to pass for supporting evidence is merrily dragged into the mess so that teenageer's fashions, Nazi movie directors, economics and urban planning are all treated as part of some greater whole. Don't get me wrong, there were several places where the book gave me a new perspective - but on the whole I found this to be sloppy work.My views may be in the minority but I would still recomment the average reader keep some aspirin handy!"
3,"Good Beginning, but a poor close","I saw this book on the shelves and was hopeful that its promising title would be fulfilling. It wasn't.Although granted, the beginning was exactly what I had desired. A serious look at how ""style"" in the modern sense, has directed and formulated all of the facets of how we interact with our new modern world. That utility is now determined by not just how well it works, but also how it feels, looks, smells and tastes.Then the book just fell apart. Her main thesis stated with grace, she rambled on for the next 80 or so pages. It was a struggle to keep reading, but being the errant sociologist/Industrial designer that I am I felt obligated.- any book where I pity the pages that keep the letters... well keep it on the shelf."
2,Preaching to the Choir,"Postrel manages to do nothing more than preach to her choir. Those who believe that our obsession with appearances makes us shallow and easily manipulated will merely point to Postrel as an example of that shallowness and lack of self-perception that makes her easily manipulated; those who accept Postrel's thesis will believe that her opponents are the ones being manipulated into lives of dullness and little imagination.Neither side, and Postrel is particularly guilty of this, can respond to the other with anything more than polemics and platitudes.More importantly, if this is the biggest issue Postrel can find to write about, her world must be a very safe and just place. For those with more pressing concerns, her book is a waste of time."
3,"good job, wrong premise","Ms Postrel did a fine job as a reporter, describing the extant cultural trend toward aesthetics as primary in virtually everything; her error is in thinking that this is a good thingThorstein Veblen coined the term 'conspicuous consumption' back in 1894, and the worldwide cultural effects of this destructive value continue, and, per Postrel's research, are becoming inescapable -- the full realisation being hordes of consumers wearing t-shirts bearing the logos (advertising) of products that they cannot afford to buyso you have poseurs spending double the sensible value for a given product just so that they can display their robotic aesthetic taste, the necessity of which precludes any concern for the have-nots of the worldthe aestheticism described in this book by Postrel is empty -- a symptom of the disease called Western culture -- and her promotion of aestheticism ignores meaning in the ethical sense"
1,"Poorly written, lacking in charm",A very disappointing read. I purchased this book in the faint hope that I could find a writer that equalled Georgette Heyer in wit and charm in this genre. There is nothing here that even approaches Ms. Heyer and a lot that will make any intelligent woman squirm. Do not waste your money. I would have accorded this book less than one star but that was the lowest option available.
5,The best Larryboy yet!!!!!,My kids and I absolutely love this DVD. It is applicable to kids and adults alike. Big Idea has made another great video. I would give Larryboy and the Bad Apple 10 stars if I could. We are big VeggieTales fans and this has quickly become one of our most favorites. It is definitely Sunday morning values - Saturday morning fun!!!!!!!
3,Not the Biblical-Based VeggieTales I remember,"Don't get me wrong, this was a nice story, with good morals, but it's (obviously) based on a very fictional world. What happened to the old VeggieTales shows where they based their story off of a real Biblical story?This series is quickly becoming just a 'good' show to watch, and not one where your children are going to learn about stories from the Bible."
4,Movie,The movie was a good quality movie and I would recomend purchasing it. Although the small watch packaged with it was broken on the clasp part.
1,Don't bother!!!,"This video is junk. The first hint was the Chevrolet ad on the front cover of the VHS box. Then the first 3 minutes is an ad for a Chevy van. Half way through the video they make a trip to the hardware store, in their new Chevy van. They then explain that these ads are important because the video would have been more expensive if they didn't have the advertisement.In the video all windows and doors went into perfectly level and plumb frames. No trouble shooting or hints. For example they installed some new french doors. He says, lets check to see if the threshold is level? Perfect, ok, let's nail it up. Oh, and they hammer in all nails. No pneumatic nailers or cordless drills. 1/3 of the video is watching them hammer in nails. What a waste of my time and money.If you want a great video ""Tom Law"" has an excellent video. ""Gary Katz"" has a very good book and so does ""Scott McBride."
3,Small items can get lost underneath,"The photo makes it obvious but why does it have to be raised with the space underneath to swallow pens, pencils clips and other small items.It comes with 4 stick on feet that protect the surface but raise it still further."
4,Smugglers and Secret Passages!,"This is an enjoyable Miss Silver Mystery. As usual we have Ms. Wentworth's motley crew of characters that she depicts so well. We have the remarkable Miss Silver who has been asked by Chief Inspector Lamb to pay a visit to an old inn called the Chatherine-Wheel. The police have been watching this inn for a long time because of rumours of smuggling, jewel theft and drug trafficking. It's not long after Miss Silver gets there that a murder occurs, and Miss Silver and Frank Abbott are in a race against time to prevent more killings. There is nothing that the crooks that use the old inn for their illegal activities will stop at to keep their secrets safe. The pace in the book is more urgent than usual in a Miss Silver mystery, and the story is exciting. I enjoyed this book. And of course, there are Ms. Wentworth's wonderful characterizations to help it along. She makes her characters so realistic and none more so than in this book."
2,Slightly disappoining,Being very fond of detective stories and rather the old ones with few or no murder/s I did not get any real mystery feel over this one. But I am still a fan of Miss Silver.
2,Not up to standard,Okay. Like the author but not her best work. Don't really get a feel for the characters which can make or break a book. Just ok.. Overpriced for what you get.
5,Miss Silver in a former smugglers' inn.,"If you haven't yet sampled Patricia Wentworth's Miss Silver novels, then this might be the one to try first. You'll join a reunion of descendants of a dysfunctional family whose sons were named Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts. They are summoned to The Catherine-Wheel, an old sea coast inn formerly occupied by their ancestors, pirates and smugglers.The cast of characters includes several eccentrics, a pair of lovers and, of course, a murder victim. There's some gentle humour in the narrative, much that is mysterious, and some adroit detection by the marvellous Miss Silver."
4,Excellent book!,"Virginia Middlebrook and A.C. Ryerson had both been burned in painful marriage.Neither had any desire to relive the past-they'd take things slow.A Caribbean trip seemed like the perfect way to test the waters of a new relationship...until A.C. wins a breathtaking emerald bracelet with a mysterious past. Suddenly their days-and nights-become a become a reckless roller coaster of adventure, desire...and deadly peril. Not the best of JAK's books but still an excellent book!"
4,Ok,This dool is pretty and my friends and I love playing with her but come on-I thought that they could do better on the clothes-the hood is hard to get on but in a cool color. At least this doll didn't smell like shampoo straight out of the box like the other Kayla I have. (PU) Plus Fashion Fevers are pretty but I still don't give super love to belly shirted dolls (But aren't they all?)-Attina:) I still like her tho------Preteens can like dolls!------
2,Not as pictured,"In the photo, it appears this record book has columns and it does not. It's just like a regular notebook page. I was really disappointed. I found an old hardcover recordbook that my dad used to do bookkeeping in and I wanted to get one like it as a backup for business expenses and income and it's just like a regular notebook. :/"
5,K&N is the best,"This filter is ""upgrade"" for my car and it helped me gain some oil pressure over all but most noticeable on idle after some driving usually it goes below 30psi but with this filter its stays around 32psi which is good."
3,Captain Midnight,"If you grew up in the 1950s, you'll enjoy a trip back to Captain Midnight and his amazing jet that was a step up from ""Sky King"" and his Cessna T-50 (UC-78) and his 310A. Yes it's hokey but for kids you could hardly do better on a Saturday morning. It still features commercials for Ovaltine and Kicks. So for kicks, watch this one with an eye to your youth and it should be fun."
2,"Only works with Windows Vista, software specific.",Software only works with Windows Vista systems; no up-gradesnor will it work with Windows XP.Tried various operating systems and programs. Did Not work.
5,Top Hits!,"I bought this cassette tape for the original version Of The Girl On The Billboard by Del Reeves,but I ended up enjoying the whole tape with Buck Owens another great legend."
3,Take a trip into the past,"The books boxing tips are fairly standard, and if you have some knowledge of boxing beforehand then you probably wont learn anything new. However it does point out the obvious meat and two veg of the sport and serves as a reminder to fine tune any mistakes you might be making. As it was written in 1903 the language of the text is quite interesting as it gives the reader an insight into the era that was, and maybe a feel for how the people of that time were thinking and acting before any world wars. It's very ""We are British and we will save the day"" sort of thing. Kinda humourous really."
1,fraudulant seller,"The sale for ""The Queen is in the Kitchen"" is misleading, and borders on fraudulant. The photo shown is for the hardcover book with dust cover. If you look at the title, they note that it's paperback. I would not trust this seller to be honest."
5,As always this show never ceases to deliver!!!,This show never ceases to deliver!!!There's never anything to dislike with this show!Anyone who likes Mark Harmon or has seen NCIS before will not be disappointed!
5,Ducky as an Investigator,It was good to see Ducky in this new role. It reminds of the old days when he was a part of the Avengers.
1,problems with downloaded product,NCIS is my favorite show and I missed the first epidode of this season. Thought I could catch up by purchasing it for my Kindle. Wrong...restarted 4 or 5 times and finally gave up.
3,Love the Show,The cost of the individual shows is too high. I'll wait for the season to come out on DVD. One
4,NCIS is always a terrific show ...,I subtracted one start because Season 9 was just so over the top excitement wise. This season seems a little slow in comparison. IMHO
4,NCIS is still an excellent show after 10 seasons,"Parts of it can be hokey and unrealistic, yes. But it's a fictional TV show. An escape. Aside from McGee's weird voice change this season, it was very entertaining."
3,"Was fantastic, just okay at the moment","Originally I loved this series, started going sideways last season; Stories more than a little bit over the top. Directions that they took the story just didn't catch my imagination.Not to fault the actors, I think they're doing well with what they've been given.This season, even more of the same, a lot of stories just seem to be there marking time.Still fairly enjoyable, but I'm personally close to cancelling my subscription as at this time, I'm not driven to see the episodes as soon as they come out.I wish them well, and hope they manage to pull out of what I personally perceive as a slump."
1,Justified,"Justified vs NCISNCis is a 10Justified keeps getting worse and ""worse ER ""It had become trite and simplistic ;Raylan I once thought was on his way to be a new Clint Eastwood hero ; but his writers have sidelined him"
3,More time for RECOVERY.,"The picture was not clear--almost like it had a filter applied. In one section, the screen froze while the dialog proceeded. I did see the entire episode which waswhy I had purchased RECOVERY."
2,Video purchase,Experienced great difficulty with viewing the video. When the video actually played (in five separate attempts)the full screen view was easy to see and decent for catching a missed episode.Phoenix
5,Who wouldn't love seeing this show!,The acting is great ! The stories superb! And the cast to die for! I have all the seasons on DVD and am looking for to add Number 10!
5,NCIS,I enjoy viewing each episode. The new season is action packed and keeps me glued to the set.I would highly recommend downloading the newest episodes of NCIS to watch at another time.
5,Love quality,My absolute favorite show :-) there will never be a cast like this one in my life time! Very excited
5,love ncis!,"My husband and I missed a couple episodes on TV, so it's nice to know we can watch them here. Not a bad price, and Amazon is always offering good deals."
5,Bugklr,NCIS is one of the greatest television shows to date. I still havent decided if i like it or walking dead the best.
5,NCIS is the best,"I love NCIS! I hope the show lives forever. The cast shines, work together as one. The scripts are brilliant."
5,Love NCIS,"I love NCIS and am so glad that this season isn't letting me down. Usually a lot of shows start to stretch too far when they continue on for this long, but NCIS is still going strong."
5,NCIS - Best Ensemble Cast on TV Today,"I LOVE this show! Each character has their own distinctive personality, but together they create a deliciously blended whole. I adore each and every one of them but for different reasons. The relationships between the characters are continuously fresh and entertaining. The back stories are great. There is just the right mix of humor and pathos. Also love the casting of guest stars. Sometimes I can't follow the stories, but it doesn't matter because the delivery is so awesome."
5,THE BEST FROM CBS,"BECAUSE THEY ARE VERSATILE ...JETHRO'S EYES SPEAKS, ZIVA IS AMAZING, ABBY IS GENIUS N COOL, PROBY IS SMART N GENIUS ALSO, DINOZZO...PLAYFUL BUT COOL...DOCKY, BEEN VERY GOOD ACTOR SINCE I FIRST SAW HIM FROM THE SERIES ""THE MAN FROM UNCLE"".."
4,Gratuated from Penn Grad school during his reign,"Education, street smart (partially due to his street friends of youth), networking ability, social skills, socializing selectively among the most influential, are contributors to this author's achievements in life thus far.It would be worth while for Mr. Gregorian to use his skills and experiences in helping today's independent Armenia."
3,Beautiful reading!,"I read the book in flight and really enjoyed it! She not only describes the system she brings life to a system that could be cruel! Dr. Schloegel has captured the essence of ""cell to society"" beautifully, five stars!"
2,Reminds me of a great rock star getting soft in old age,"First of all, I spent a great deal of time in my mid-teens talking about MST with my friends. It was the penultimate fantasy series until George RR. Martin came along and blew the lid off of the genre.I opened Shadowmarch with high expectations, and was completely disapointed with the whole book. Re-hashed characters with no depth IE Chert=Binabik Barrik=Josua(both have a bad arm? Please) Briony=Miriamelle (both characters are always whinging and unreadable) Chaven=Morganes the list goes on and on, only in MST the characters were fresh and had definition. In Shadowmarch TW just goes through the motions.All in all a major dissapointment from a great writer gone soft."
2,Slow and underwhelming,"I am not the typical Williams fan, being that I loved his otherland series but was rather lukewarm to his tradinal fantasy writings. But while memory, sorrow and thorn is not my favorite fatasy series, those stories had an urgency to them that is shockingly lacking here. The story is slow moving, not a whole lot happens and the world is left rather underdevoped for having finished a more than 500 page novel. By the end of the novel I was skipping pages(somthing I nearly never do) to see if somthing more interesting happens at the next POV change. Simply put this novel is only for the most bored fantasy fan, who is unwilling to risk buying some more unknown author of the genre."
3,A gloomy fantasy novel,"I have enjoyed Tad Williams previous fantasy novels. However, I found this book hard going. He successfully pervades his novel with a sense of gloom and doom - to such an extent that I found this rather depressing reading.As usual he has produced a richly detailed world, and a quite large cast of characters. Tad Williams novels are never short but this one, for me, seemed to go on forever, and towards the middle I found myself slowed to a crawl with reading it. Although there are portions, such as the section that dealt with the emperor's new wife, that I found I would like to know the end of the story, overall this book is not engaging enough for me to want to buy a hardback of the second book in the series and left me feeling somewhat disappointed - though I do know of others who loved it."
2,ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I am a huge Tad Williams fan, but this book was a real disappointment. It was boring and I never was able to 'connect' with the characters with the exception of Chert. I seemed to be mostly political intrigue and very little action and the intrigue did not keep my attention. I'm hoping the second book in the series is better or I won't buy the third."
2,Tad Williams thanks George R.R. Martin,"I might re-visit this review later as in all honesty I've only read about 3/4's of the book at this point, but so far I've found the book to be a near pointless (and inferior) rehashing of G.R.R.Martin's Ice & Fire cycle. Tad, what were you thinking? (And I'm a HUGE fan of ""Otherland"", as well as ""War of the Flowers"".) This is just a very pale shadow of another author's more powerful work. And I was so-o-o looking forward to this series. I'll keep reading and hope he has something original up his sleeve ..."
2,Boring,Got to page 125 and have given up for now. I actually get a bit depressed thinking about reading it. It is really really S - L - O - W. I usually make myself stick with a book for at least the first 100 pages to give it a chance. I did my 100 page duty.
3,by-the-numbers,"The young people of an ill-fated family (complete with wolf banner) are caught between the unnatural beings behind a border to the north and the greedy and evil rulers to the south - I know this has been pointed out, but this is like a watered-down version of Martin's _A Game of Thrones_. The twins had the potential to be likeable, but spent most of the book in childish bickering. Williams has used his plot devises with adequate skill, but the final result doesn't really stand out or amount to anything with strong emotional impact."
2,boring,the beginning was interesting but it was boring and long winded after a few chapters. the pace is tedious and the characters are un inspiring. i finished the book and was happy to give it away.
3,3.5 almost 4 stars,"I'm not sure if it has more to with me being older and less patient but I am finding myself enjoying less and less books that go on and on but don't go very far in plot.Now don't get me wrong I am enjoying this series, I'm nearly done with the second book, but it isn't as engaging as his Memory series. I could not even get halfway through the first book in the Otherland series and War of the Flowers was soo boring I'm surprised I did finish it at all.I have to say I think this has more to do with my bitter disapointment with Robert Jordan that has colored how a read other authors books now.I want a steady flow of plot and while this book is not at all as bad as Jordan's it does stall at times making me impatient.Tad is very good writer but please all I want is nice creative plot that doesn't drag on and on and is all chopped up in little short chapters!"
3,"Fairly uninspired fantasy story,","Just finished the book a few days ago. I put it down several times along the way because of lost interest - something I almost never do. Eventually I finished it and in all it was enjoyable. The story is really quite uninspired, though. Fun, but definitely not in the upper echelons of fantasy writing. It seems to borrow heavily from R.R. Martin's works. I got a distinct sense of ""been there done that"" while reading. There are no major twists, the characters are predictable and mostly forgetable. On the bright side it seemed well written and I have no doubt that that author is capable of putting out fine work - this just isn't it. I do not plan on buying the following volumes."
3,OK but not more,"My recommendation: Don't spend your money, borrow it from the library. Shadowmarch had me curious enough to finish the book, but it definitely was not a page-turner. The plot plodded along for all 642 pages and the characters had little depth and were not all that likeable. Quinnitan and Vansen were the likeable exceptions. Barrick could have died and I wouldn't have cared. When you get to the end, the only question answered is ""who was the murderer?"" Everything else is left unanswered or unresolved for the next book. I'll read the next one because I'm still curious, but I'll get it from the library too."
2,Unfortunate,"I was very excited to see Tad Williams returning to heroic fantasy. That is, until I read the book. This is probably my shortest review EVER, because I just don't know what to say about it. Memory, Sorry and Thorn was a masterpiece, and I was hoping for something of the same here. It was a huge letdown. And yes, I agree with another reviewer - it's still better than Terry Goodkind. Then again, almost anything is."
4,An epic adventure...,"I've noticed that many of those who reviewed this book have mentioned that its pacing is a little slow. I agree, 100%. However, this book is the first of the trilogy, and I believe that the first book in an epic trilogy tends to be of a slower pace. I'm fine with that, because I feel that Williams spends this time developing the history of the world he immerses you in. This allows the feeling of being ""sucked into"" the world he creates for you - you can almost see it, hear it, touch it.This book was a great introduction into the kingdom of Southmarch and its characters. I look forward to the continuation of the story."
2,Long and Boring...not epic,Shadowmarch has quickly (or slowly I should say) found its way to my top five worst books. I really liked Tad's style of writing and I really wanted to ejoy this book. But Shadowmarch is TOO LONG AND SLOW. Nothing happens in this book. It is chapter after chapter of the princess crying over her family's misfortune. The book started very promising and I was really expecting a great story. But the plot is stretch sooo thin. The book may have been good if it were about 200 pages shorter.
2,Very disappointing,"I like Williams and had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, until the last 100 pages or so, I was wondering why I even bothered to start reading this. The book really plods a long without getting anywhere. I'm usually patient enough for a set-up, but I thought too much of this book was spent on irrelevant and wasteful precursor. Boring characters at this point, and quite frankly, I'm sick of adolescent protaganists.Still, it's a 100 times better than Terry Goodkind."
1,"Unrelieved, boring gloom","Yhis novel is ponderous, slow-paced, and absolutely depressing.there isn't a single moment of relief to despair, gloom, misery and tragedy. It's only a Tolkien in negative."
2,A Diificult Truth To Acknowledge,"I absolutely loved Tad Williams' Memory,Sorrow,and Thorn series. When his sci-fi series came out, I eagerly read the first novel, and regretfully concluded that Williams' sci-fi style was not to my taste. When War of the Flowers came out, I bought and read it as well. More mediocrity. Finally, Shadowmarch was released. Surely, when allowed to write in the sub-genre which originally catapulted him to fame, he would once again release a polished and engaging tale. I have never been more wrong. Williams makes the mistake of thinking that the more main characters there are, the better. The result is a book with characters that you never know well enough to actually like. I have concluded, reluctantly, than Williams is something of a hack. If you could buy a ""Write-By-Numbers"" Kit, this book would be the result."
2,Copycat,"That this book is a rip off is obvious for everybody who knows his way around the fantasy genre.The only thing I don't know is whether T.Williams is copying himself from the Dragonbone series or G.R.R Martin from the Song of Ice&Fire.; Probably both.I can explain some of the raving reviews only as being an impression of people who find their way in the ""better quality"" fantasy writing with this particular T.Williams novel.And there I must admit, writing is something T.Williams does well - even this horrible sub-par War of Flowers is quite corectly written.I might have given 3 stars but this apalling lack of originality and shameless copying deserves only 2.Well I should have known better, I picked it up because of the Dragonbone Chair but should have known that it would be a disappointment with a very high probability.So for those who are in a similar case, stay away from this thing and use your money on S.Erikson or the Martin's original work instead."
4,How am I going to wait for part 2?,"The worst thing about this book is that it's only part one of a trilogy. I read quite a bit of fantasy when younger, but this was the first fantasy book I'd read in a few years and I was immediately hooked. There's a rich and diverse set of characters who you can identify with, despise or become intrigued with. The setting reaches far and wide. I got completely caught up in this alternate world and all of its mysteries. It is long, it is detailed, it has lots of people and places and history that you need to keep straight -- not so much of a problem when you read the book in huge chunks over a few days time, but I'm not sure how much I'll remember by the time the next part becomes available! I guess I'll have to re-read it then because I definitely want to know what happens to these characters and learn how everything is connected."
5,Complexities for the reader to discover.,I thought the prologue was mysterious and gripping. Every bit as good as the prologue on SON OF EREUBUS (J.S. Chancellor) that leaves me with a shivering spine every time I even think about it. Did I tell you how much I love Chancellor's works '.Willimas did a great job creating mystery as you read the book. You get bits and pieces but must continue to read and gather clues. Much like another beloved author Cas Peace in her Artesans of Albia series. Though I think Peace's characters were slightly better developed. I still enjoyed Williams characters.I think the best aspect of this book is the complexities that the author lays out for the reader to discover.
2,Ho hum,"Tad Williams has written better; I enjoyed the first couple of books of his Otherland series, The War of Flowers was a good book, and the Memory, Sorrow, Thorn series was a respectable bit of fantasy literature. Shadowmarch just feels weak. I had trouble making it through this book, finding it a potent sedative - handy if you have trouble sleeping, but not an endorsement generally."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"I started this, and found it was too dull and I was not interestedenough in the character to continue. Boy, with little people advisers,gets in trouble, etc., etc., I suppose my tolerance for standardfantasy trilogies is getting less and less all the time. This was verydisappointing compared to the excellent Memory, Sorrow and Thorn,though. Get those instead if you are considering Williams and haven'tread anything before."
4,"Basics & features explained, great tips","This book is an essential for getting the most out of this powerful program. The basics are explained simply and thoroughly and the most valuable tips as well as features new to Illustrator 8 are highlighted.Menus & dialog boxes are illustrated throughout, helping the user find the right buttons & settings. Well designed output samples show what is going on with each step, making the transition to the advanced features a smooth one.Some of the things I found most useful were detailed information on the use of Photoshop filters in Illustrator and extensive coverage of third party plug-ins. The chapter on type showed me some great new ideas.There is a color gallery in the middle of the book that shows off the fabulous potential of Illustrator 8. Most of this art is on the CD-ROM included with the book, as are a number of demos & plug-ins, some are only for the MAC."
3,All you need is the CD,"The music is enjoyable, but Lyle has no stage presence whatsoever and honestly, his facial expressions and looks are very distracting from the music. Not to sound mean, but he has the perfect face for radio."
4,My tooth is about to fall out.,This book is an easy reader and easily understood. I think it is very helpful in letting your child know about losing baby teeth in a simple manner.
5,great for beginner readers,"This book doesn't have the best art work or the most original story, but what it does have is exactly what a beginner reader is interested in reading about. A great vocabulary builder for your beginner reader. Your 4-7 year old will ask to read this book again and again. ""uh-oh! It wobbles. It wiggles. It joggles. It Jiggles. My tooth is about to fall out."" The book continues with, "" I hope it doesn't fall while I am playing ball or swimming in the pool."" Until it finally falls out in the spaghetti and meatballs. The book continues with some fun information about why your baby teeth fall out and that "" Big teeth will begin to show from under my gums, way below."" Great book."
5,Continua siendo la mejor......,"Christina nos presenta esta vez, un album un tanto mas tranquilito. Un album que parece provocar un extraÃ±o placer en los oidos de quien lo escucha. 10 canciones (no todas nuevas) a cada cual mas buena con un par de versiones de canciones ya editadas en su ultimo disco en solitario. La ex-compaÃ±era de grupo de Alex de la Nuez (Alex & Christina), no para de sorprendernos en cada disco. Despues de mas de 10 aÃ±os desde aquel ""Souvenir"" o sus ""Mil cambios de color"", se observa un cambio al 100% en su estilo musical. Su trayectoria paso por grupos como Christina y los Subterraneos, dejando huellas imborrables en la mente de muchos de sus fans. Lo que si es una pena y reivindico des de aqui, es que es muy triste que no se haya editado este disco en EspaÃ±a. Aunque a quien le guste realmente esta maravilla de artista, ya sabe donde encontrar este disco."
5,Excellent product,A naturopath recommended this product for me. A friend of mine who is an herbalist has a lot of respect for Source Naturals. This is one product I consider important for brain health as well as for natural help with cortisol production.
1,No effects noted,Haven't noticed any difference. The Theanine Serene has a funny (mediciney) smell and taste to the pill when taking it (goes away after a few minutes). I got these pills based on others' feedback - I realize it's only been a couple weeks and hopefully after a month I'll see some results... but as of right now I feel I'm wishing I would have not spent the money. :-(UPDATE 1-22-11: No difference noted after using product for over 60 days. Won't be purchasing any more as it is basically useless.
2,Tastes atrocious,"This is hands down the worst tasting pill I have ever taken, and it is so large that there is no way to take it without tasting the abominable flavor. Also, as far as I know GABA doesn't cross the blood brain barrier so I don't really see the point in it being included in the formula."
5,I echo the previous review,"Yes, I have this book for sale but my enthusiasm for it springs from the creative designs enjoyed back in 1979 when I was creating and sewing. I bought 2 copies, also. Cannot part with the second copy because I never know when a creative urge will come over me and I'll want to read this book again. I was happy in 1980 to find this book. I'm surprised to find it on Amazon. You cannot go wrong with the ideas in Wearable Art if you are one that loves working with fabric. You will love it as much as I do!"
5,Christmas present that doesn't stay in the closet,"My 4-year-old has enjoyed these so much. He has the Roving Rollers and the Building Buddies sets. He can look at the pictures in the ""building book"" and make many of them all by himself. He has created his own ""mosquito"" and ""cartwheel man"" with help from his big sister, who is almost seven, and loves these toys, too. This is the kind of toy that will not end up in the bottom of the closet!!!"
3,Billboard 1978,I purchased this CD so my daughter could hear some of the songs I was listening to when I was her age. It brought back some good memories. My daughter liked some of the songs too.
1,Picture is better than product,This product looks much better in their photo than it is. The item is made out of quite thin material and looks cheep. I did use on my project but would not order again.
5,98 Degrees and Rising 4 Bonus tracks and video,"I am a big 98 Degrees fan and I thought this cd was well worth the money! I especially liked the video cd which has the videos for Cherish I Do, The Hardest thing, Because Of You, Was It Something I Didn't Say and the first black and white Invisible Man. The bonus tracks of The Hardest Thing and Because of You are great dance remixes that are not on their other albums. The Christmas cd single of This Gift is one of my favorite songs off their Christmas album"
5,Best Whitening Agent Around,Impossible to find in the stores...used to be available...not sure why its not sold in the stores but it is still the best Whitening Tooth Gel on the market. I used it before my wedding instead of paying to have my teeth whitened professionally. I look at my wedding photos and think my teeth looked like they were done by a dentist! Can't recommend this product enough...you won't be disappointed with the results in fact you'll be amazed and sold on it!
1,It doesn't have any impact at all!!!,I thought this whitening would work based on other reviews but it actually made my gum sensitive and didn't whiten my teeth at all. It is definitely a waste of money.
4,Good way to get an introduction to the language,"I recently bought this book with the companion CD's to learn a little German before a move to Switzerland.The book focuses on high German. The lessons are short, and the exercises varied. The CD's provide you a way to listen to the pronounciation of a native speaker and are very helpful. The CD's also include dialogs which you can listen to and then you are asked to take the role of one of the speakers.If you put in the proper effort this book will surely help you learn. Like learning any language however, it is more about how much effort you put into it.This book will give you the lesson plans, and a structured format to learn, all you need to do is commit the time."
5,Love Lunchbox Love Notes,"I purchased this book last summer. It contains notes for all the major events and holidays that fall in the school year as well as summertime. Making it good for daycampers also. Sure, we can all write out a note, but too often we get busy, and this is convenient. It makes my daughter feel special."
3,Deconstructing Moses,"Good book overall. I especially like the author's analysis of the several distinct styles of writing contained in the first 5 books of the Bible. I feel, however, he misses several archeological facts to support the historical Moses (like the Ten Plagues). I don't think the author set out with an objective mission while doing his research, but the book is still worth a look."
2,Kirsch is a detached biographer...,"...too bad he is not a more passionate writer. He seems to miss so many crucial elements in the life of Moses. Yes, there is much missing about this great man known and loved by millions, but Kirsch seems to exult in the petty. He writes as an uninvolved observer of this extraordinary man. There is no love, no passion, no sense of deep respect for Moses in this text. I kept waiting for the page that would reveal some astonishing, delightful insight into this spiritual giant but I read in vain.Kirsch chooses wonderful subjects but leaves the reader with less information and more questions than when they first picked up the book. More insightful and intiguing studies have been done on the life of Moses. I suggest looking elsewhere for inspiration, no offense to Kirsch."
4,The Real Moses? Who Knows!,"Since there is no archeological evidence that Moses ever existed, author Jonathan Kirsch uses the words of the bible,together with modern biblical scholarship to re-create the great prophet who exists between the lines of scripture. Kirsch goes through each chapter of the bible beginning with the book of Exodus and ending with the book of Deuteronomy and shows where various traditions and counter-traditions might have intersected. He shows the Moses who is portrayed as a great hero by the ""Deuteronomist"" and the Moses whose role is diminished by the ""Priestly source."" He discusses virtually every theory including the theory that their were two Moses and the first was murdered! This is surely not the book to read if you are a bible literalist (or an Orthodox Jew) and I certainly don't agree with all his points, being partial to the biblical story myself. But Kirsch is a lively writer and it is an interesting read nonetheless, as is Kirsch's ""King David""."
1,False Packaging Advertised,"The advertisement for this product is for a case of tabs, including the original case price marked down. What I received was individual packages. Although the company did not charge me for the three I received, they have not changed their advertisement. This is misleading."
2,Agreed. Eh.,"Someone needs a hug on this CD. I loved his first self-titled CD, but this one... I listen to track one and the acoustic Alive track 11. The rest. Fast forward and skip."
1,Shower caps,"Very flimsy -- can only use once. The plastic tears very easily. I'm using them to cover bowls and wash them to use them again, but these rip before I can use them a second time. Didn't used to be that flimsy."
1,A bust,Product was faulty and could not be inserted in my printer. The return was handled well and my payment was refunded. Possibly a replacement would have worked by I was mistrustful and went elsewhere.
3,ATTENSION: NB:,THIS IS NOT A NEW CD FROM DESTINY'S CHILD... Some very funny people have written rather doubtful reviews about thi so called new cd.. Here we have good information about DC which you'd all enjoy if you are not buying it for the music ;) I think it is very funny though that people actually write reviews about a non existing cd... Have fun... this is a good cd for educational purposes... ;)
2,2 Stars for the effort,"I wish I could share the enthusiasm of those who read the book before me - unfortunately I can't. The author looses his train of thought quite a bit. Believe me it is aggravating when you try to figure out whether he meant this or that or maybe he just wanted you to do it. In my opinion this book doesn't clearly state the steps involved - therefore I can not recommend it, it's simply not a good technical reference material. When it comes to technical books - they are either good or bad, there is nothing in between. It is just like with E2K - it either works and you know how to fix it or it doesn't work and you are definitely forced buy a book other that this one."
2,Not a good choice,I think Mastering Windows 2000 Server is one of the best Win2K books on the market. I was expecting Mastering Exchange Server 2000 to be much the same. This book quite simply frustrates me. I keep it on the shelf and refer to it sometimes and then remember how bad it is. The problem with this book is that it covers the spectrum of Exchange 2000 with no detail about anything you might encounter if you actually run Exchange 2000. If you want a book that describes what every menu in Exchange looks like then this is the book for you. I have given this book a fair shake but its definetly 2 thumbs down.
1,Rename it to Intro to Exchange 2000,"If you have never used Exchange 2000 you may want to buy this book. The author scratches the surface of some very nice topics and then walks away from them. The first 400 pages are filler explaining Windows 2000 and very basic AD concepts.Very disappointing book unless you are an Exchange newbie, and even then it probably wouldn't help as the author just scratches the surface of a topic."
2,Highly disappointing,"I found this book highly aggravating and not at all useful. The author describes the obvious in painful detail while skipping the many things that really need explaining. His open 'chummy' writing style is, I suppose, supposed to be congenial, but it's just annoying. Mark Minasi he is not.He does cover a lot of material, and if you've never seen an email server before in your life you might find some of it useful. But if you're an even slightly experienced SysAdmin, this will just not satify you."
5,A review from the teacher,So my students published this volume of poetry. It's an amazing anthology with fresh perspectives. Take a look at it. All royalties earned will be donated to the American Red Cross. Enjoy!
3,1980,This shows why MTV came into being. This is the cheesiest music you will ever hear and why Disco died in the first place. Please don't buy this. The '70s disco era was the worst in the century and really shows it on this collection of billboard hits.
1,Junk drive,"This item is, according to SanDisk,a counterfeit. It also contained a virus. The included software is fradulent, and did not work. WORTHLESS ITEM!"
5,RUFURB works great!,"I bought this size because it is the only one that works in a ABB robot controler. Well 128MB or smaller. No problems, looks brand new (except the REFURB printed on the side). Paid like eight bucks for the thing shipped to my door!"
1,Incompatible with my hardware,"I recently purchased this product with the hope of full plug and play capability. I tried it in my new Dell Latitude D600 running windows XP and it would not work, found hardware ADIR ROM. I called the Sandisk helpdesk who said there was a known bug and that I should get my money back. This is the second Sandisk product I have had an issue with, I won't be buying a third. Looks like from the other reviews I was just unlucky but I thought I would warn all the Dell laptop users out there."
3,beware of slow speed,"This thing is ultra small and sleek and cool looking, but it takes an AWFULLY long time to transfer files to it. A 10 mb file takes about 2 minutes. So it'd take a good half hour to actually fill the thing up in one go. that's a pretty big downside if you generally use it to quickly transfer biggish files, that are too big to just email."
4,A Good Read!,"Author Paul G. Whitmore elucidates the advantages of a criterion-referenced instruction program based on having employees practice new skills and tasks. This differs from traditional or academic training programs in that skills are evaluated through performance rather than tests. As he explains it, you can feel how much he believes in teaching job competence through practice. However, while this approach might work well for certain skills that lend themselves to being taught readily through repetitive practice, it may not work as well for tasks that involve creativity and non-routine thoughtful activity. Thus, he may overstate the advantages of his one-size-fits-all approach. The book provides voluminous detail about creating systems to organize and deliver skill-based training, so we believe it will have specific appeal to its target audience: learning officers, training managers and human resource directors."
1,Make sure you get what you order,"Be sure and check what you get immediately when it comes in. The description says 130 volt, which is what I wanted. After I rented a man-lift (expensive) the bulbs arrived and they were 120 volt.I put them in anyway because it would have been too expensive to rent the lift again. One of the bulbs has already failed with only approximately 100 hours of use.Very short life span for even a 120v bulb!"
1,Rubbish - ends broke after 3 months.,"Worked fine for a while, then became difficult to turn on as contacts began to crumble. After three months, it no longer turned on at all. As I took it out, I noticed the reason - the glass around the plastic housing at the end had just crumbled."
3,None,Poor description of the book condition. I recd the book & it had water damage in the back of the book. Because the person I got the book for didn't mine we decided to keep it. The water damage didn't effect any of the pictures.
5,Thank goodness for AMZ,I live in an area of Delaware that has absolutely no Asian markets. Thank goodness for AMZ. I was able to get my Jufran fix. I like Jufran better than the competitors because it has a thicker (lumpier) consistency. Great with eggs in the morning!!!
3,Kayla is an ASIAN DOLL not an AA DOLL,really if you are going to buy a doll on Amazon buy one from someone who knows something. Kayla is an Asian doll. Christie and Nikki are AA dolls. this doll uses the same head mold as Lea and it is not an AA headmold.Also these dolls are no where nearly rare enough to cost almost fifty bucks. the older fashion fever dolls are collectible and there will be less Kayla dolls made than of Barbie. SO she is collectible and desirable but overpriced in the listing here.
5,"Wonderful ""Deadly"" Series by Brenda Joyce","Brenda Joyce's ongoing ""Deadly"" Series is wonderful. Francesca Cahill and Rick Bragg work wonderfully together and are falling in love with each other though Rick is married. His wife has been in Europe for 4 years and he is supporting her. The first in the series was Deadly Love, then Deadly Pleasure, and now Deadly Affairs. Deadly Desire will follow in May 2002. Other interesting characters are Connie (Fran's sister) and Neil, her husband, Calder (Rick's half brother), Evan (Fran's brother) who is engaged to Sarah and neither are happy with this engagement,Maggie (Joel's mother and Fran's assistant). You will enjoy the crime solving by Francesca who is not like most young ladies of wealth in the 1902s. Read the books in order. You'll enjoy the suspense and the developing relationship between Rick and Fran."
2,"No mystery, no romance...","I was extremely disappointed w/Deadly Pleasure. The mystery takes up 5 pages in the beginning, 5 pages at the end and is all but forgotten in the 300 pages in between. The heroine Francesca Cahill is supposed to be a clever sleuth and charmingly naive, but instead came across as nosy and clueless. There is not enough interaction between the heroes to make us believe they would fall madly in love w/each other. I was irritated all the way to the end when the idiot savant once again solves the crime before the superfluous hero rescues her...again."
1,Deadly Pleasure,"I bought this latest book because I was familiar with most of her previous productions. It really should be titled ""Deadly Dull."" I was dismayed at the very poor level of writing. If this were a ""1st book"" I would never buy another. The dialogue was wooden. The plot was developed in a choppy way and was largely unbelievable. The heroine was impulsive, intrusive, insensitive, and so annoying that her appeal to the males (Bragg and brother) was beyond comprehension. I thought her brother-in-law's response was most reasonable and was sorry he didn't hit her or worse, so that we could see if she might actually be able to learn some restraint. I will carefully peruse any further publications purporting to be by Brenda Joyce before purchase. This one goes immediately to the second hand book store."
3,Good start in a new series.,"I bought this book to tie me over until my new book is ready to arrive. Francesca Cahill is refreshingly new and very young woman who is trying to become a detective in the very early twentieth century. Back at that time there were no computers and other fancy gadgets to help solve crimes. I enjoyed her enthusiasm and her wit and her determination to help the people who came to her for help. Also, I enjoyed the minor characters, Connie, and her brother who both came to her for advice, but Bragg reminded me so much of Roarke in the Eve Dallas series. I might read the next book in the series. I hope that Brenda continues to develope both Francesca and Bragg and to see if she becomes the detective that she wants to be so much."
3,Wrong Matches,"I enjoy the Deadly series and have read other reviews, I just felt that I can add my 2 cents worth. The crimes were predictable and it doesn't take much sleuthing to discover the culprits. The romances are somewhat predicatble as well. Although Fran is attracted to Bragg, it is apparent that she has put him up on a pedestal. Also, it is also apparent that there is some unfinished business between he and his wife...I think that the next book will shed more light on her character...which might not be as spoiled or selfish as Fran assumes. I see more of a romance developing between fran and Hart...I think this would be better for her and I think that is the way that author B.J. is meaning to end the series. Any comments on that?"
4,What I expected,"I think people are expecting books with these. My son enjoyed this DVD, even though he's seen the movie, because there are words on the screen. We also liked the vocabulary part of the DVD. Reminds me of the old records that you used to follow along and turn the page when Tinkerbelle's bell sounded, except now it's onscreen."
3,"Okay, but better with book","My son loves books but finds the read-along DVD uninteresting. I like the fact that it can expose children to other languages, but this will only work if you can get them to watch/listen. Maybe this format would work if kids weren't exposed to high stim TV/Videos. I think it would be much more useful if they included a book the child could reference as the story was told. I know I used to turn the pages of Disney's Cinderella book to follow the movie, and it was great fun. Maybe as my son starts reading more on his own, he will enjoy this more, but I doubt it. I'd pay another $10-15 for a book that went with it in all languages."
2,Nothing new here!,"This is the 4. CD with more or less the same concept (Maximum Eminem,Audio Biography CD and Eminem Story with Interview are the previous ones) and probably not worth buying unless you are crazy about Eminem and feel the necessity to own everything in connection with him. If you are a fan there is nothing new (his life story, how he achieved his current success etc.) for you in this CD; and if you are on your way to get close to Eminem this definitely isn't the material you should start with!"
5,A real beauty,"Set during the Second Crusade, the story revolves around Gilbert Warde, an English knight, and the two women who love him: Eleanor of Aquataine (Queen of France), and Beatrix, a childhood sweetheart. The power, of course, lies with Eleanor, but Gilbert is true to his childhood love. The ending is a bit strained when Beatrix refuses to believe that Gilbert loves her and asks for proof. He rescues her from a kidnapping which is very melodramatic. Eleanor is much the more interesting character, and Crawford portrays her, with all her faults (she is, after all, married to the King of France), admirably. This is one of Crawford's best novels, a real page-turner."
1,Bland!!!,"I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews, but this tea tastes flat, bland and a bit bitter. I've searched for a decent decaf tea and finely found three, two here on Amazon, and for less money than the Taylors. Bigelow Organic Breakfast Blend is the best. It has a rich, deep, aromatic flavor and goes well with a bit of sugar and milk or just plain. Higgins and Burke decaffinated Orange Pekoe is lighter in flavor than the Bigelow, but still offers deep amber richness. The third isn't sold on Amazon, but hopefully they'll add it as they carry the Peet's brand coffee. Peet's decaffinated English Breakfast loose tea is decent, too.I use the Bigelow for single cup enjoyment and the Higgins and Burke for making ice tea."
3,I used to love this tea...they are weak ....,"I used to love this tea, it is not as strong as it used to be... The price has been increasing.....I do not love as much now that it has risen $1 per box in the past 4 months...."
3,Dark cup of tea missing aromatic oils,This decaf tea will make a dark cup of tea. However much of the aromatic oils that are part of the experience of drinking tea are missing.The packaging of this product may have something to do with this - each bunch of 50 tea bags is placed into a cardboard box which is wrapped in a thin sheet of plastic. 6 of these wrapped boxes are then placed into a holder which is then also wrapped in plastic wrap. Given the thin plastic used the aromatic oils are lost pretty soon after manufacture.Other manufactures individually wrap their tea bags in individual foil lined pouches. Others use heaver plastic to hold the oils in.If you are fussy about tea I'd pass. T**d*r J**s has better decaf tea than this.
5,"Great product, great company.",i have had nothing but good experiences with the NOW Foods brand of supplements. The Devil's Claw in particular has allowed me to stop taking a liver-damaging anti-inflammatory. Two capsules three times a day is proving very helpful (i take it under the direction of a naturopath and a rheumatologist).
1,no proof of plan received,I ordered the 1-year replacement plan a few months ago and quickly received an email thanking me for ordering it. I forget whether the email read that I would receive the plan by email or U.S. mail but I have yet to receive anything.
5,Fresh air,"I have never seen a presentation on grammar like this. These guys are teachers that enfuse subjects with lots of fun, interesting devices to help you relax and learn the subject.I would recommend this to any parent with a student struggling in grammar. I've since purchased many others for my kids."
4,easy to use camera,"I found that the camera was very easy to learn. The quality of the pics, movies, sound was very good. A couple of things that bring my rating down are:1. Camera has no light, zoom features when taking movies2. The access to the batteries is a little awkward(sp?) to figure out.3. The access to the extended memory/usb/tv jack is a little flimsy leaving you with the worry that the cover will come off.4. And now after 7 years of use, I now have to manually open the lens cover when I turn on the camera."
3,No 1024 x 768 resolution,Nice product by HP but just a couple of things:1- It does NOT have the 1024 x 768 resolution.2- Memory door is very loose.3- Battery door is very very tight.I know I am goning to break them sooner or later.
3,It is not a good camera,"It is a SIMPEL camera.There is many good cameras at same price, and very good performance than it.It resolve you camera problems, if you want a easy camera.but it is not good."
2,Unsatisfied,"I was really unsatisfied with this camera- beware- if you buy this camera you will need to buy the docking station and a camera card- both of which DO NOT come with it. You will need these items to use this camera often. This camera is not the best of what is out there but it gets you by. Wish I waited to buy something else- most other digital cameras are smaller now, come with more and hold more pictures."
1,Disappointed with this model,"I too picked this model on the positive reviews. I bought it in May of 2003 along with an HP photo printer. In August 2003, a few days before my vacation, it just stopped working. HP tech support was excellent got another right out to me. Now April 2004, it did it again. It worked one day, batteries went dead, I charged them and can't get it to turn on again. Tech support was great another one is coming. However, my 1 year warranty is up in May and I am on my 3rd camera! They will give me 90 days on the 3rd one and that is it. I am going to have to buy their extended warranty program through HP because I fear in 3-6 months, it won't work again. I expressed my concern and I wanted to upgrade to a newer model and pay the difference. They don't have anything to offer for this one. Something is wrong with this series. On the other hand, the printer has been great."
1,Disappointed,"I have purchased other products from this manufacturer previously, but, was very disappointed with this purchase. The adjustible compartments would barely stand up on their own as the connecting part at the bottom did not work very well. With a steel product it seems crazy to call it flimsly, but, that is the way it seems. I can even use it and have given it away."
1,Worthless piece of junk,"DO not buy this item, it is worthless threw mine in the trash 30 minutes after installing it. I thought that this would leave me print already made greeting cards. Instead all it has is different designs and pitchures. No premade cards with words are on this CD. You need to add you own words and greetings, no use to me. Glad i only paid $3.50 for this."
2,Not enough fun,"I found this DVD a waste of money. I thought that it would include a book for my child to read along with, which it doesnt. It only has one game and my child mastered it early. It also only have one music video, and a poor choice at that. If I could I would of returned this item for a complete refund. But Amazon doesnt take back opened DVD's. Not recommend, save your money and buy the book."
2,Not worth the $,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I bought this as soon as it was released, and I thought it was the film (the photo and details were not available until it was actually released). After watching it a couple times I am very disappointed. This isn't worth the bother. By the movie and a book. Skip Mitch's bouncing ball!"
3,Margarita 101,"Was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. Haven't listened to the cd yet..it's a small, not extravagant gift. But, may look too small if you are trying to impress someone."
2,A complete letdown.,"What really amazes me about this book is that it is the second half of a book originally published as one large selection of Bukowski's short stories. I have read the collected first half which is called ""The Most Bueatiful Woman In Town And Other Short Stories"" and liked it emensily. However with this book everything fell apart and I did'nt even read the last few stories. Strange indeed. I guess my first experience with Bukowski was fresh and new. Now my second experience was just putting up with a boring drunk. This could quite probably kill any desire to read more of Bukowski."
5,Love this book!,"The short story on ""the pest"" is one of the funniest things I have ever read! I love his refreshing honesty and lack of tact-it's great!"
4,Bits and Pieces.,"While the stories aren't all together linked, the big picture is clear. Charles Bukowski may very well be writing from the mouth of madness. He uses this book to paint pictures of the lives he sees, and often times lives. If you're looking for a good starter book that doesn't hold back, I recommend this one. My first and still my favorite of his works."
1,Jackass: The Book,"The longstanding question of what someone will say to get attention has finally been answered. Charles Bukowski has crafted a novel with all the hideous ugliness of a movie like Buffalo '66 but with none of the underlying artistic skill or creativity. It is a remarkable bit of irony that Bukowski is a so-called poet, but we learn this in the pages of a book that should never have been written, much less published. The book jumps from one pointless and often disgusting story to another with no rhyme or reason and leaves you wondering why you just read it all the way through."
3,One Can Only Pity Him,"Some of the stories contained in this collection are comical as has been mentioned. However, for the most part the stories come off as vulgar, crass, and lacking artistic direction. I was continually reminded of the proverbial ""hack"" typing away at his typewriter while reading this collection. Now if you happen to like rape, bestiality, references to crap, gambling, horse-races, alcoholism, and smoking cigarettes then this may just be the book you are looking for. After reading through these stories one is continually reminded how pathetic and lifeless a human being can become and for what? Why is Bukowski a sad, broken-down, hack? Well, he never tells us and one can only surmise that it's because he is naturally lazy or lacks motivation. Anyway, I won't completely knock him because some of his writing seemed to show promise but it was undeveloped promise that needed more refinement and a touch of class."
1,Congrats Mr. B - What a pile of drivel!,"Congrats Mr. Bukowski! You win the prize for being the first-ever book that I just couldn't make it through. 60 pages. That's all I could read before I threw it in the trash.Such filth (and I'm in construction, should hear MY mouth) and pointless drivel. Completely disjointed - and not the stories to each other, but within each story. How in the world did this guy ever get to be published?Buy something else. Anything else. Just DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Great Short Stories,"Buk hits hard with these classics.""The Great Zen Wedding"" is one of the best short stories I have ever read. His honest take on life is refreshing, much better than the large amounts of fecal material that the publishing industry is producing in the year 2003."
3,'82 Revisited,"This is an average collection of songs from '82. ""Centerfold"" by the J. Geils Band is a classic and is welcome on any album. Songs like ""Gloria"", ""Harden My Heart"" & ""Eye In The Sky"" are nice additions as they are good songs and you'd never want to purchase complete Laura Branigan, Quarterflash or Alan Parsons to get them. ""Maneater"" is not one of Hall & Oates better efforts and ""Up Where We Belong"" is still sappy as ever."
5,wow hymns,"Wonderful music. I got it during a stressful time and when I played it in my car....constantly! , my spirit was lifted"
5,Great music,This is a great compilation of hymns. They aren't played in a boring traditional. Very good artists and great songs.
2,Disappointment,"The voices of the singers were of course, great, however, the musical rearrangements were horrendous and ruined many of my favorite hymns. Nothing like you sing in church, which is what I wanted."
5,Young Lenny is absolutely stunning - better than new DG set,"I was rather untouched by his new recordings of No.1 and No.5 made by DG. So I didn't think about buying his old Mahler set until now. With all those predictable shortcomings, it will not fail to shake your spiritual grounds. Any serious lover of music must listen to these performances once in his life!"
2,Listen to the Carnegie Hall set - MUCH Better.,"This is a good set but the recent complete set from ""Carnegie Hall Presents"" is far superior. The sound quality is second to none and are just more enjoyable. This is good, but the Carnegie set is FANTASTIC.Mahler: The Complete Symphonies [Box Set]"
5,Outstanding Mahler Compilation,"I think is very important for a Mahler Fan to hear carefully all his work. This compilation allows you to enjoy that experience. A better sound quality for some symphonies could be a great plus, but you have to consider that this is a remasterized old record.Leonard Bernstein just express the true passion that Mahler put on his work. It's incredible that (using the 8ve Symphony as an example) with fewer instruments than in the Abbado version, the feeling is even better. Simply outstanding.Great price, great compilation. Lot of Mahler."
2,Too wide dynamic range,"The technical problem with this set is that the dynamic range is too large. There are passages that come out of the speakers at an extremely low volume -- so low that one can literally not hear them. So one turns the volume knob to raise the volume. In a few minutes the speakers are shaking the walls of the apartment. So one turns down the volume knob. So the next one hears nothing come out of the speakers, because it is a low volume. And so on, ad nauseaum..."
3,Okay i guess,"I don't know if its just me but I didn't think this DVD had enough ""helpful"" words for a baby. I say it had about 5 words that was worth teaching myself and baby. But hey that's just me. I think that the DVD is more for education of the mommy or daddy not baby. Baby should learn the signs by the parent DEMONSTRATING them not by watching TV especially if under a year old.!"
2,SKIP IT!!!!,"Picture quality poor (dvd made from the video?) My 14-month old will not sit down to watch it, and it worked like a sleeping pill for myself. Light elevator music in the background, signs not represented well enough with examples. If you want something that will engage your child and get him/her involved, get ""Baby Signing Time!"" or ""My Baby Can Talk"". My daughter LOVES those two series and has learned over 50 signs from them (we started at 11 months)!"
4,Baby See N Sign Vol 1,"This video isn't all flashy with puppets and cool toys like Baby Einstein, but my 2 year old son with PDD Autism absolutely loves it. It has the signs set up in sections where you can play them all at once or you can pick which ones you want to play. It has some signs I can't ever seeing us using, but its so exciting to see my little one signing along and laughing."
1,Boring!,"I've watched 3 DVDs on baby signing - this is the most dull and boring. It consists mostly of straight-on head shots of the same woman, signing each word over and over again, with too few shots of a baby signing. It would be overwhelming for a parent just learning about signing, as it presents a great many signs instead of focusing on the most useful ones. ""Sign With Your Baby""Sign with your Babyis much better presented, delightful to watch, and includes wonderful explanations and tips from Burton White.Jan Hunt, author of The Natural Child"
5,I recomend this product! (but it might not be right for everyone),"I got this for my son when he was 20 months old because he was referred to speech therapy. He is delayed in talking, and they introduced the alternative of using sign language. This DVD is not exciting and interactive, but my son (now 2 1/2) still loves sitting down to watch it and practice the signs. It is very good at simply introducing a variety of commonly used early words to sign. Also, since we've been signing, his interest in communicating (with words, actions and ideas) with me and other children has increased."
3,More for the parent,This video introduces a lot of sign language but it's not interesting for a child. It's great for a parent to watch and then the parent can use the signs with the child throughout the day.
3,"Content is good, but lacks DVD menu","My main complaint about this DVD is that it is basically a video, but on a DVD. There is no DVD menu to choose which part to play, so you have to watch the introduction and tutorial parts (or fast forward through them) each time. I liked ""My Baby Can Talk"" better. That said, the content of the video is good. If it had a more user-friendly format on the DVD, I would like it a lot."
5,Great video!,My daughter is handicapped and has virtually no speech. We had tried other signing videos but she learned none of the signs.After getting Baby See 'N Sign our daughter finally started using some of the basic signs.
4,Good Times,"Let me just say, I've been dying to get my hands on this series without breaking my wallet. I'm happy to say that everything went quite smoothly with my expectations. I'm a huge fan of 80's style anime, like Dirty Pair and Robotech. It just has that look that anime now a days just can't replicate. First of all, most if not all of the series was made by hand and not computer help. It just shows a lot of blood and effort on that part alone. They also took great care in making each episode on movie standards, all quite polished thanks to the remastering. I would highly recommend putting the settings of audio to Japanese and subtitled, since the english is a bit crappy, America back then was just getting into anime and unfortunately not every voice actor was good at expressing emotions or tone for that matter. Other then that, this series is an absolute gem."
4,Very good starter kit,This is a good magic starter kit. The instructions are easy to understand and the tricks are doable even for my 4 year old. The wooden objects are also quite durable and simple to recognize. I would recommend this for children 4-9 years of age.
3,"Good Tricks, Poor Construction","We got this toy for my six-year-old son, and although the tricks are age-appropriate, the equipment leaves something to be desired. The box with the flip-up bottom has a very poor hinge design, and either sticks or falls apart. The balls are a bit too large for the cups and are constantly getting stuck inside, and the flap for the ""disappearing object"" box was put on backwards when the kit arrived. For the price it's okay, and the tricks are easy enough for a child to master, but since Melissa and Doug items are usually a little higher-quality I was rather disappointed."
1,DANGEROUS,"My 5 year old girl, who was very excited to get her first magic kit and kept asking when it would arrive, promptly got her little finger so stuck in the magical mystery disappearing box that I had to saw through its bottom to release her. If I hadn't been home, my wife would have had to call out the volunteer firemen for assistance. Now, my daughter has no interest in magic whatsoever."
2,Expected better,"I expected a better made product that was easier to use. One of the tricks (ball and cups) was too tricky for most of the adults in the room to do and this was likely because of the poorly made buttons on the sides of the cups. The buttons were too small and stiff to be easily pressed. One of the other tricks was manufactured poorly as well and fit unevenly together. Overall, I was disappointed."
4,magig toy 2,Arrived fast and as described . It was not as much fun as the 1st magic item but price was good so I bought both. It was fun for a period but I think I should have bought the 1 for same fun payoff. Still cute and sweet gift
5,Great for the young magician,"I bought this for my 5 year old nephew for christmas, and as soon as he opened it, he played with it all day. An adult needs to do the trick first (for such a young child) but once it was explained to him, he was able to do the trick very well. He got such a kick out of being able to show us his magic tricks. Very durable pieces and comes with a nice box that fits everything nicely. Highly recommend."
2,Too weird for little kids,"For my 5 yr. old son and 7 yr. old daughter this was just too weird. I'll go with a more generic magic set with balls, cloths and boxes."
1,SIMPLY A HUGE WASTE OF TIME & MONEY......,A big melange of mumbo jumbo.. Talk soup at its worst..The author perhaps were trying to put his audience into hypnosis by his mere style. He sure is successful on this one! The structure that is expected from a study book is non-existant. [...] In my opinion a huge waste of time and money. My copy is going to the trash can. Thank you!
5,Hypnotize this Review,I have found the book Hypnotize This! as an informative approach to hypnosis and a step by step method of learning about hypnosis. The book also goes through terminology and establishes the difference between myths and facts about hypnosis. I consider this book as a must for anyone considering hypnotherapy.
5,this book is excellent for beginner,"this book has been covered by all around from the beginner's level upto the clue for master's. Start with this book for your hypnotist career. Whenever I am confused and feel lost the highway to hypnotism, I always go back and simply read this book. I keep this book somewhere I can reach with my arms on my desk all the time."
5,Great Book on Hypnosis!,This is one of the best books on hypnotherapy that I have encountered to date. It's an actual treasure tove of fabulous contributions from thirty-three world renowned hypnotherapists and contains articles on every imaginable subject related to hypnosis. This book is a well balanced combination of theory and technique and explains how the mind works and why humans are hypnotizable. A complete study course in hypnoisis that leads you step by step through the hypnosis process. Mr. Segal makes the subject matter easy to read and understand. I absolutely loved it and know you will too!
5,Yet another engaging psychological thriller from Lindsey.,"""[T]he reality is that we can never really penetrate the truth of why some men do the strange things that they do. We can only view such men with pity and compassion, and remind ourselves that none of us are exempt from error, sometimes serious error, from playing the fool. When you look at these men try to temper your judgment with humility, with a modest nod to your own ignorance of the uncertain ways of the heart.""These words, advice long ago offered by Haydon's father, highlight, perhaps, the considered, insightful, and thoughtful prose consistenly delivered by Lindsey. In this intricate, delicately written novel, the author grants the reader a rare glimpse of Haydon's family history, as shocking and unexpected as it turns out to be.Whether familiar with or new to Haydon, the reader will doubtless be engaged by Lindsey's tale"
3,mediocre,"I strongly believe that anyone who gives this albun 5 stars hasnt heard many black metal albums.Or maybe they like music purposely recorded with a muffle sound as is this album.I hear what Malefic is going for but I think its too much.Even the earliest black metal(most with truly bad production)is more discernable.It's a shame too because this album has some pretty cool music(entrancing),and definitely atmosphere.The vo-kills are evil as well.Basically this is great music to play as you mind torture a blindfolded,bound victim in a dark basement."
2,"Good price, not so good skateboard rail.","I was super excited to receive this rail, and especially excited for the low price. However, I should have been more wary that a low price tag meant a sub-par product in this case. The rail is rickety, thin, and downright scary to use. The only positive aspect of this rail is that it is better than no rail at all...barely."
4,Grind Rail Review,"Quick shipping.very sturdy metal material, you wont be able top break this rail... but pretty average in regards to an experienced skater, its very rickety at the conection point in the middle ( comes in 2 pieces ) which makes it difficult to do anything other then board and lip slides and 50-50s. this easily fixed with some homemade modifications though.overall good product."
1,Missing pieces,"Like others said, the pins were all missing so we can't even put the thing together. So basically we just threw away the $70 we spent on this. I would not recommend buying this."
3,BEAWARE!!!!!!,"I don't know, maybe I'm the only person to have gotten this problem, but when the rail came it was not boxed or anything. Just the box and rail itself. The box was damaged and a hole appeared! When I opened the box I was soooo excited to finally skate this! And what came to a surprise and a let down was there was missing an item, or three. I was missing three pins!!!!!!! I contacted the company and was charged 12$ for the missing pins. Now I have to wait another week to skate it!!! Overall, can't wait to skate it! Looks sick, no doubt."
3,"Not the best, but good for beginners","This rail is certainly not of the highest quality, but you get what you pay for. It is good for doing easier tricks but does tend to wobble around a bit and move if you land on it poorly. Overall I am pretty happy with the purchase and recommend it to beginners who are trying to learn how to slide rails."
2,"Nice rail, but missing parts","I bought one of these for my son a few years ago and he loved it. It is square which makes it easier to balance while grinding and held together well after repeated use. Convenient to have at home and light enough to be easily moved and broken down. Unfortunately it was stolen, so I decided to get another one for his birthday. Box came in with a hole and when I opened it, the pins and rubber feet were missing. Ended up buying some pins at the hardware store an split some rubber hose for the feet, then duct tapped them on. This works well to keep the rail from sliding. Not sure where in the process the hole in the box came from, but others have noted the same issue. Purchased on Amazon because of the price, but ended up spending another $10.00 to replace the pins. If you want to go through the hassle of a return, or spend the money for missing parts, the rail is a good choice for the beginner."
5,Amazing Book,"This book will change your life! It forever changes the way you view sex, sexual energy, and intimacy. The exercises alone are wonderful and transformational as well. I cannot say enough good things about the information contained in this book. The exercises are challenging but once they are mastered they completely enhance you and your entire life both spiritually and sexually."
2,very wordy and really not to be learned from a book,"I bought this book, it seemed to be interesting. First he starts with the statement that you should not learn these techniques with this book and search a center. I assumed that he wrote this to avoid liability lawsuits. But reading on I found it very wordy and difficult to follow. I guess all the positive reviews were written by people who actually visited a course. Then I read about the ""ovarian breathing"" which apparently is a cornerstone of the practises. The descriptions on how to do that are very poorly written and you cannot follow them without visitng a course. The pictures are not better either. How can it be so difficult to explain a breathing technique in simple clear steps with half the words?Most of us don't have Tao courses nearby or can afford to visit one. If you must visit a course anyway then why should you buy the book?Maybe google delivers a clearer decription of the techniques, I'll have a try."
3,Not the best one in the series,"This was the second book I read in the Royally Wed series. I have to admit that while I liked the heroine, I thought the hero was an obnoxious oaf who did not deserve to end up happy. Their relationship was based on the flimsiest of reasons (one night of fabulous sex MUST mean two people are meant to be together), and, aside from a pregnancy and some tepid banter, there was no reason for them to be together. This book was a bit of a disappointment after the first one I read, the fabulous Undercover Princess."
2,Hero and heroine not engaging,"Unlike Undercover Princess (Suzanne Brockmann's Royally Wed installment) this book didn't have engaging characters. Princess Elizabeth of Wyndborough met a man at a masked ball and although she is a virgin, she has sex with him that night and ends up pregnant.He is actually Prince Raphael of Thortonburg who has spent his life avoiding those annoying Wyndborough princesses because both royal parents would just love to see their children marry and unite the families. When he discovers his lover is Elizabeth he lashes out that she was setting him up, when he discovers she is pregnant, he cruelly taunts her saying that it's probably not his.Elizabeth never comes alive and Raphael is such a jerk, and unfortunately their relationship never recovers. They get their happily ever after, but I didn't really care."
5,excellent product,"This product helps my eyes when it is irrigated, its bring great relief and comfort to my eyes."
5,The Perfect Girls (and Guys!) Return,"I loved this Replica book! However, if you have not read Perfect Girls #4, you might want to read that one first before you understand some of what they say. If you liked Amy, Andy, Aly, Annie, and Aimee you definitly want to read this book.Mr. Devon appears (??!!), the Pink Smocks appear, the Organization appears, this is a thriller, and keep you on the edge, as they face competition, survival, and friendship trust!Five stars all around!"
4,Great beginning washed up ending,I thought that Marilyn Kaye's eighteenth book of her series was well plotted. I loved the thought of an beautiful island and Amy was trapped on it. The idea thought of the organization being able to get all 12 Andys and all 12 Amys there was hard to believe. If they were looking all those years for them and suddenly they get them to get on mystery boats and float away right to them. There were a few unanswered questions. I liked the book in general and it was fun guessing what was going to happen next.
3,"Not her best work, but good","Although the plot was clever, some of the things were too unrealistic to use the typical suspension of disbelief. The chormosone machine was almost impossible, and the idea that all celebrities are clones is insane and almost destroys the concept of the book. The Amys and Andys are supposed to be these fantastically unique people, and suddenly, there are almost hundreds of cloning projects simply for the benifit of Hollywood? I don't believe it, and I pray Marilyn doesn't pursue this idea."
5,Great book-worth your time,"These books are in the 9-12 age group, but im older than that and i find this series intriging. the print is a little large and the books aren't very long, but they are all amazing. #18 is no exception.Amy finds herself on an island with all the other amys-and all the andys. Every couple days, one of each is voted off, acorrding to how well they did in the days games and contests. What happens to the clones that get voted off the island?"
1,Fazzizle Manizzle,Yo d to the og fazzizle manizzle. WoRd! Yo ya'll I'm a Rebel soldier from da South side. The original Def-Boys are great. These guys are a disgrace to the name. They insult my dignity and integrety. They cause hurt to my Rebel pride. I am horrified by their display of lack of talent. Do not buy this cd!!!
4,Great looking but has some issues,"I just got this for Xmas to replace my undersized Belkin 4 port hub and it looks great. It works fine for most of my peripherals but don't bother hooking up your Soundsticks to it. The music skips about once every 20-30 seconds. It also requires a powercord (adding to the already overflowing powerstrip) unlike the Belkin which will work w/ or w/o external power (in accordance with USB specs I may add). So, I have the soundsticks plugged in directly to my TiBook and then the hub in the other port to all of the other peripherals. I debated returning it but the blekins are not stackable and take up a greater horizontal footprint. Sometimes I just wish I could find one product that did what I needed..."
4,Great USB 2.0 7 port hub,"Easy to set up, keeps cables neat. Excellent throughput even with mix of low-speed and high-speed 2.0 devices plugged to same hub. Only downside is that this port requires AC power to be plugged in (AC adapter included) for it to work, regardless of what you have plugged into the hub."
5,Pricing,"Since ADAPTEC itself lists the retail price of this product at $99.00, why does AMAZON list it at $139.00, then claiming to give you a great discount at $79.00?Look elsewhere."
3,"Good book, not for Kindle","I do not recommend at all you buy the Kindle edition.The figures are too small and what is written there is unreadable.Zooming does not help, as the letters become blurred.This is a pitty as the book is excelent.Buy the printed edition. I would have rated it 5 stars."
4,The Complete Brambly Hedge,"These are wonderful stories for children. The books I ordered are obviously new, however, the dust jackets were not pristine - some damage at the top edge. I was disappointed."
3,FLYBOYS,Not exactly what I was expecting. But still fun only 12 missions. Would have been better to be able to pick a person from the movie and play that role out.... not too bad though.
3,jon's review.,This game should have come with an IP to IP multiplayer option. It is too hard to get fellow cyber squadron members to pay xtra money for something that should be included in the original purchase. The lack of this feature has really eroded our view of this game.
1,CONNED,"FIRST : I should have read ALL the reviews ; that would have saved me , a wasted , $13.00, and a lot of aggravation !!I have a pretty ' fast ' computer / video game card / and DSL internet connection.... BUT... their ' Mandatory Network Updater .. requirement [ 563.85 MB ... running at 48.83 KB's ] is taking over 3 HOURS.... to download ... to my computer ????????!!!!!!!!!!WHAT ???!!!! Am I doing something wrong ???Why doesn't "" Interactive Magic "" ... state that it will take .. over 3 hours ... to download their ' mandatory ' updater .... in their ad ????As far as ' playing it ' ... it will be past my bed-time ... before this thing is ready to "" fly "" !!!!Interactive Magic : I will NEVER purchase another thing that has your name on it!!!!Conned and Disgusted...."
2,Flyboys for PC game,"The hype and movie was much better than the game. It is reminiscent of those mindless arcade games we used to play 30 years ago.Sort of like some MS releases - Buggy, little or no instruction, bad graphics and no support.Targetware is 10 times better and free."
3,A little disappointing,"This game has a lot to be desired. The graphics are good but the scenarios are too short and very easy to navigate through. The views from the cockpit are extremely limited making it difficult to engage targets at all.The ""online"" feature is a joke, not sure why they even added it. Loved the movie, not a fan of the game."
5,They get it!,"Finally, a book for a business audience by authors who truly understand the impact and proper role of technology. Its not techno-babble, and its not futurist pontificating at the 100,000-foot level. As Goldilocks would say, it's Just Right for anyone seeking to understanding the business realities of the post-dotcom world."
5,Well thought out,"Don't mistake this book for just another Internet book.It's well though out from a business perspective.If you are in some way responsible for your company'sbusiness and IT strategy, you should read this book."
5,A pleasurable business read,"The X-Economy was a brilliant mix of history, today's economy, technology, business direction, stories, and practical thinking. It is a book that is not only relevant for now but will serve as a reference for the future. I had a vague understanding of the paradox I was living in - the instability and yet the tremendous opportunity. - The X-Economy spelled it out in a well articulated, enlightening and enjoyable fashion. This book is important in order to make more intelligent personal decisions as well as business decisions."
1,I will never buy a sony computer again in my life,"I bough two sony laptops (Sony VAIO PCG-NV190, PCG-NV170). One had the memory slot problem (mentioned in another review below) within two years. For the second one, the CDROM/DVD ROM stopped working within one year. Recently, one hard disk died. I would not recommend any sony laptop."
2,"Huge screen, but very noisy and slow - bad deal.","I'm a magazine and book writer in the computer field and I needed a lap top to take with me on business trips and to do demonstrations of Virtual Human technology. I did my research and this looked like the baby I wanted. I was wrong! The performance is astoundingly slow for it's CPU and memory. The hard drive is rediculously loud and worst of all is that, shockingly, Sony has the worst attitude towards customer service of any company I've delt with in years. To top it off they never sent the [money] coupon refund that I qualified for. They also won't give you that 1 year waranty unless you read the fine print and register within 30 days!!! Try a Toshiba instead."
1,Terrible cooling systems,My Sony laptop suddently stopped working. One of its fans was died. It will cost me from 69 bucks to 300 bucks to remove it. Don't buy Sony laptops.
1,Sony VIAO GRX laptops have bad mother boards,"My Sony GRX died one month after the warranty ended. It boots up, then dies as soon as it warms up (about 30s after bootup).It turns out that the vias on the motherboard have a known problem that Sony nothing about. I will never by another Sony product!!!"
1,I will never buy a sony computer again in my life,I bought Sony VAIO Laptop in 1999. Without any physical accident this computer died in the middle of word processing. So this product only lasted 1 year and 3 month. ...
3,I Paid Too Much!,"Maybe if I had paid $10 instead of $18 I would consider this a better buy. Unfortunetly, I paid too much. My 4 1/2 year old daughter is in LOVE with Ariel, so I bought it and was not real pleased. Neither was she. The find Sebastian game was fun for about 3 minutes (she found him every time) and the story is narrated with still pictures from the video. (maybe a different story about Ariel would have been nice) I do think the foreign language part is cute, although a little tough to understand for a 4 year old. All in all, for $10 it's a decent buy...but no more than $10!"
3,It's OK!,Disney makes a lot of excellent childrens movies. This one is just good. My children did not love it. And I can say its didn't hold a lot of magic for me either. This is just a matter of personal preference. Someone else might love it.
4,Some of the great Top Hits,"Billboard Top Hits 1983 has some great songs on it and it is well balanced. The first half of it is good rock 'n roll hits and it has one of my favorites of all time: ""Africa"" by Toto. The second half of the album are all love songs and most of them are pretty good. ""True"" and ""Total Eclipse of The Heart"" are two songs that definitely belong on this album and make it shine.The only drawback I saw to it was one that might just be me. I wasn't crazy about the songs, ""Stray Cat Strut"" or ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me."" But you might like those songs, that's just my opinion. The other 8 songs are great and this album is worth buying any day of the year. It's one of the best of the Billboard's Top Hits series from the 80's."
4,"Very Thorough, Very Good","As an avid fan of Caribbean history, I claim this book to be one of the best I have ever read. It is a must for anyone interested in the Haitian Revolution on Saint Domingue. Mr. Ott thoroughly covers the revolution from start to finish. His writing style is efficient and to the point. The book analyzes the causes and effects of each stage of the revolution from every possible view point and deals in depth with the leading figures of this event. I highly recommend this book."
3,The Most Dangerous Game II : Werewolf Edition,"This film is closer much more of an ""whodunit"" mystery tale than a full-blown werewolf horror. The acting is pretty good for 70's British horror, though everyone seems rather calm as they sit around and wait to be killed by the ""hunter"" and/or the werewolf. This particular transfer is gorgeous in video and audio. Also note the groovy 70's soundtrack...My only qualm with this movie is that even though Peter Cushing is featured on the DVD cover to sell the title, he is only a supporting character in the film.If this sounds interesting to you, I suggest picking it up in the Amicus collection 3-pack for the best value and two more, much better films."
1,Worst hypnosis CD ever: New version of the emperor's Clothes.,"Now it is not what the emperor wears it is what he listens to.I mistakenly believed the previous review and bought this CD. With a pedigree such as Dr Weil's I was completely disappointed to have purchased this CD.My expectation was for this CD was to have a soothing voice over and a alpha theta and delta wave back ground lulling the listener into a rapid relaxed state with various exercises. Dr Weil's voice is a rich baritone that raises the bar and the expectation level to at least nearing that level.Instead Steven Gurgevich's voice I could bearly listen to once. Thin and grainy it made me cringe, turn on the lights get out of bed and put another CD in. And I paid for this! What were they thinking? That they can throw anything together and fools will buy it? Seems like it."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Generally, I do not find that classical music relaxes me as does Andrew Weil's ""Breathing: The Master to Self-Healing"". I find that excerpts of complete concerti etc. bothers me; I want to hear the whole piece. For others this cd works extremely well."
2,Not worth my time,I found that the first of the two CD's was of no interest and the second contained instructions that sounded to me like they came from an old B movie.
5,Self Hypnosis,"This is an excellent cd. What you get out of it is what you put into it. Understand the context and use the tracks. Relax your body and mind and focus. If you can do that, very good things will happen, if you let it."
4,The Campaign that Captured Jeff Davis.,"In the spring of 1865 Union General James Wilson mounted a cavalry campaign designed to destroy the industrial sections of Alabama and Georgia that were still untouched by combat. From the Tennessee River to Selma and Montgomery Alabama and on to Columbus and Macon, Georgia this campaign was lightening fast, crushing everything in its path.Moving 14,000 men over 500 miles in just a month is a remarkably uncommon feat. So is fighting 4 major battles along the way. But General Wilson's forgotten campaign not only defeated and captured Nathan Bedford Forrest but also captured Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens as well.This book is the study of a massive Union cavalry operation that was executed with impunity, one that destroyed what little was left of the Confederacy. It is also the campaign that captured the Confederate government!James Pickett Jones details this event exceptionally well. You will not be disappointed."
3,Great Gameplay but needs a Story Mode,"The game came in perfect condition and on time so no complaints about the delivery or anything of that sort. The main problem is with the game itself, mainly being that the game seriously needs a story mode. Your pretty much playing an arcade game with no clue who your fighting or why exactly the people on screen are fighting in the first place."
4,Great fun game! Too Bad 2-D Fighters isn't Popular Anymore.,"The Guilty Gear series is one of the most fun and in time became one of the most balance fighters. Unfortunately in these days 2-D fighters don't have the crowds they use to. If worst, the GG crowd isn't that large. Great if you can find peeps to play with."
2,no story not worth price,"i bought this game a second before they announced the ""plus"" version (which is the full version of the game) so i can't say anything positive about this version. if it came out around this time the full version would be DLC"
1,A shame to the Heavy Metal name,"Well, I bought this CD the day it came out, and already I have gotten rid of it. I had been anxiously waiting for the Heavy Metal sequel and its soundtrack for years, and was thrilled to hear the announcement of their coming. However, when I began finding information on the movie, my heart sank. Only one storyline? One that only sounds vaguely interseting? Only to debut on Starz! I was thinking ""what the Hell!"" Regardless, I bought the soundtrack. Yep, to my dismay, it was filled with mostly awful ""heavy metal"". Why is it that people believe that if its called ""Heavy Metal 2000"" it should only contain heavy metal music? Duh! It's the magazine name the licence is based on, not the artists on the soundtrack! (get it Mr. Censored?) To make a long story short, the original movie and soundtrack are about 100 times more worthy of your hard-earned money than this doo-doo. Avoid this CD and the coming movie like a syphyllitic donkey."
3,Metal Fatigue,"While some of the music on this soundtrack could be considered ""Metal"", it's hardly ""Heavy"". If you're expecting a sequel to the classic original, you'll be disappointed. Still, some songs kick, and I can only hope they get some airplay on the radio. The soundtrack isn't a complete loss, but it's definitely not in the same category as the Matrix, Armageddon, or Varsity Blues soundtracks. The included Hyper-CD has a few minutes of porno-famed Julie Strain's best attempts at promoting the movie. Added incentive to pick up the soundtrack? Not really. Just see the movie."
5,Stolen love letters,"If you aren't very creative and you need to send someone love letters, steal them from Khalil Gibran. Obviously. Although I don't think these are his best, they're probably still better than anything you could come up with. Unless you're a poet, which in that case, just write your own and keep this book around for hitting yourself in the head with, for inspiration."
5,Loved It,The movie is wonderful. It is wittty and down right funny while giving a true interpretation of the issues regarding Art and Film making. I find myself watching the three fables over and over. The first one is my favorite but the third is right up there with it.I highly recomend it.Jerry
5,Music Fits the Mood,"Excellent soundtrack, loved it immediately. Too bad I lost it before I accidentally deleted it from my iPod!"
4,"A Good CD, if you like dark music","This CD is good for people who like classical/Dark/ eerie tunes. All the songs are performed by orchestra's and occaisionally you'll get an earfull of the movie's characters talking. The best tracks on the CD I think are ""The Bunker - Reprise"" and ""A Street In Wismar"". So if you're having a halloween party, or if you just like dark and classical music, get this CD."
4,Made my daughter's day!,My daughter loves to challenge us with her Christmas list and this year the biggest was an accordion. She was both surprised and thrilled to open this gift. It's adorable!
1,not a real instrument - out of tune and unplayable,"This is a toy. It will make noise, but not music. The bellows on mine was separated from the frame and leaking air and had to be glued together. The keys are clunky and the vinyl straps have sharp edges and are very uncomfortable."
1,"24 hours later, the strap broke",I was embarrassed to give this item as a gift. The keys pushed through the board by a 2 year old's strength. I expected more from Hohner.
3,Nearly good,"This little accordion is almost a musical instrument - so close! My problem with it is that the bellows can't hold enough air to play a complete phrase (different notes on in/out, so must have sufficient air per phrase). Also, a couple of buttons don't work properly - sound is weak.It bothers me a great deal when junky toys are sold as instruments: kids or adults get discouraged from learning to play - sometimes for life! This accordion is not quite a junky toy, but it's a toy.Would I give this to any youngster? Not if I wanted them to actually learn to play tunes - they might get too discouraged. As just a toy, I think it would be okay.The original design was probably fine, then with cutting corners in the manufacturing process, the quality dipped below satisfactory."
2,Actron CP9001 GM Code Scanner,Worked good for my truck but didn't work for the car that i actually bought it for so double check before you buy
3,engine computer decoder,"This model is not very specific when describing the problem. It gives you a code number, you look up the code and see what it says about the problem. But the information given, is usually too vague to be much help."
2,Not what I expected...,"Call me manipulative, but you can't accuse this book of the same quality. I was expecting something telling me how to do some down-and-dirty ""social engineering""...but...alas, no. It did give me a few tips/tricks that were cool, but it was hokey ... on how to make people feel better and garbage like that. Nothing to make someone insecure about their looks all day...or how to make someone trust you with a few carefully placed words. It doesn't even cover simple things like surveying people, and how to determine body language. Not worth the buy, AT ALL. If you can borrow it from a friend, it's fun for a couple minutes."
1,"Waste of Time, Money and Effort to Procure","I bought all three of his books thru Amazon. Oy vay! What a load of rubbish! No tricks even though the cover says there's tricks in the book. Bah. Just a load of common sense psycho-babble is here. The stuff is so generic you can find it on Google. If there were buttons for negative stars, I'd give it a -5 and tell you to KEEP your money and look elsewhere!"
2,It's ok but not so great,I like the apple butter that my grandma used to make and I was looking for something close to what she use to make but this is definetly not it.I will keep buying diffirent ones that maybe to my liking.
2,It is not that good,"Yes, this book may be honest about true male feelings when it comes to spot our weaknesses and fantasies. But, it is a recollection of thoughts that men can easily find in the private and rather sexist conversations we have when we are with buddies. It doesn't really bring to out attention anything we don't know, except for the brave act of some guys of opening themselves and talk about it in a more open way."
4,"The Penis Dialogues, Handle with Care","My husband just ordered three more of this book for presents for Christmas.We both have read it and give it a big 'thumbs up'. This is a well researched, well planned, easy reading book. There is much of interest, it elicits chuckles here and there, and it is serious as well in its treatment of the subject.Definitely of interest to both men and women and to I would think all ages other than young children."
5,A brilliant display of the fringe!,"Diane Arbus is my favorite photographer and this book displays why. Her photographs show life as it is, with diversity around every corner. The images are earie as the subjects seem to be standing right in front of you. That is credited to her technique of using a flash even in the daylight. I reccomend the 25th anniversary edition because of the better quality in the prints. Every photographer or art enthusiast needs this book in their collection!"
5,Entertaining photography...,"Diane Arbus depicts the ""off beaten path"" part of society in the most glamorous way possible. She makes the socially unaccepted look completely relaxed and comfortable in front of the camera. I am very lucky to have stumbled upon this book of photographs by Diane Arbus - make yourself lucky also."
5,Non-irritant eye drops,"These are superb for lubrication (for those who have dry eyes). They are probably the least irritating item on the market, a far better choice for those with dry eyes than better-selling drops. Pricey but worth it."
3,Costs too much,"I love this product, but I didn't pay attention to the size when I ordered them and was dismayed when they arrived to see that I had ordered the really small size for a really large price. Live and learn."
3,"Songs aside, lousy packing","I make myself clear: to have three Scorpions albums in only two CD's is great (In Trance, Virgin Killer, and, split as bonus tracks between the former two, Fly to the Rainbow); however, these are not new remastered versions. Furthermore, the box is far bigger than it needs (the contents flutter loose within); we are deprived of plastic cases for each disc, and provided instead with cardboard envelopes - and there comes just one flimsy booklet, whose notes are likewise meagre. Would rather spend more in the separate editions, alas!, it's too late for me, but I earnestly advise you no to order this item."
5,Clear and concise,I recommend this book. It offers a good overview of the Commons components and lots of examples of their usage. I especially liked the fact that it offers examples that you can apply to your daily work.
3,"Good, not great","I was already familiar with the Jakarta Commons by the time I read this book, so I didn't get that much out of it. It is well written though, and full of good technical stuff.If you are new to the Commons then I might recommend it to you; but the material in here is available from http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/index.html and it will stay 'fresh' on the website, as opposed to this book. I'd point you to there first. If you are looking for another 'roadmap' or organization of the material, then this book is for you.If you are already familiar with the Jakarta Commons, pass on this book."
5,good examples - useful book,this book is very useful. It has lots of examples that demonstrated the how and why of the Commons components. The explanations of some of the more complex components is also quite good. Just using all the examples and seeeing what all is possible was worth the money as I expect that this information will save me and my team a lot of time and effort.
4,Good for the price,"As a gift, it is still good. The stones are really the size you could imagine. The style is good also. Pay with the pice, I am quite happy."
4,All Hail,One of the most trance inducing black metal I have heard since 'Transylvanian Hunger'. An absolute must have.
2,easily dislodges,No matter how I tighten the screw attachment a slight bump or a gust of wind dislodges this mirror. A permanent glue or screw attachment is probably better.
1,clamp on mirror not so easy to clamp,This would not clamp on my windshield grab bar which is standard size (or at least I thought it was). I tried it all different ways but no go so I just decided to send it back. I went to walmart and purchased a $3 one you would clip on a sunvisor for a car and it clips on the grab bar just fine.
1,Cheap plastic. Item breaks after a couple of uses.,"Unfortunately this item is made from cheap, unreinforced plastic. The U-shaped bracket that goes over the windshield frame will crack at the corner and slowly come apart. I assumed this would happen when i looked at it and didn't tighten it at first, but then the mirror kept vibrating loose - once it was properly fastened, the cracks developed in the corners."
4,celery seed,"I read a medical study that showed celery extract improved memory. I have taken some supplements off and on for years, but I've never heard of celery extract being beneficial. I figured it wouldn't hurt to try it. It does not make me sick and has no artificial dyes that are evident anyway. Been taking one capsule off and on for about a month now. Has it improved my memory? Not sure yet."
1,Disappointed ...,Olivia Tremor Control shook me in a regulatory manner. I'm so upset I even took the time to write this unfavorable review.
5,"Smells good,feels like silk to the skin and keep you cool","I have used this product for over 3 years and i would recomend it to anyone. It smells great, feels like silk on the skin and it keeps you cool and dry. I have not been able to find in the stores for over 6 months. I was so glad that azamon stocked the product.Once you try it, you too will see how great the product is. There is also a lotion by gold bond that is great as well."
5,Best on market,10 Oz. Gold Bond Ultimate Body PowderThis powder beats anything on the market today. Not sticky. Lasts and cools very mildly. Very hard to find on the store shelves. Price was very good compared to the prices I paid in the past.
5,Best Body Powder,This powder is the best to help prevent body rashes. Has only a very lite odor. A little bit is all it takes to keep your free of moisture.
2,Okay but...,"I like that it doesn't have a very strong smell to it and that it is easy to rub into the skin. But it doesn't do as the product says. I thought this would be a useful product to use during the summer to prevent odors caused by the heat, but it DOES NOT protect against moisture or odor. After a while, the moisture actually kind of makes it chalky. I would not recommend this product if you are using it for moisture or odor protection."
3,Not For Men,"Maybe this should've been obvious, but the smell of this product is not for men. It has a flowery/perfume smell. I was looking for a product for chafing that didn't smell like baby powder, but the scent of this product is really not preferable. The scent is strong and too sweet smelling for me.I've found that using corn starch and baking soda mixed together is a good, unscented alternative for those that don't like scents (seems that all of the unscented versions have been discontinued..)."
5,Gold Bond Ultimate Powder,I love this powder. I used the regular Gold Bond for years every day and thought it did a good job. But this product is so light and smooth to use: I love it. It doesn't clump or irratate my skin at all. I have recommended it to several people because I have had only positive results.
4,A good general overview,"An interesting and simply written guide book on the ""whys"" of a very important eye issue. It gave suggestions for supplements and advice on how to prevent MD. Well worth the money to have the insights this book gave in an understandable format."
1,horrible CD,"CD lists 40 tracks, but actually has only 13! Sound quality is horrible, probably lifted from a scratchy record. You get what you pay for."
1,Can't see a difference,"I didn't see that dramatic of a difference. I've used the prescription Retin A .025% and saw better results even though they said this product was stronger than that. I'll say this: I would switch back to the prescription if it were still covered under my insurance, even though the co-pay was $50. Next time I go to Mexico I might consider buying Retin A."
4,Phoebe,"I liked this item very much, but since I use it on my arms, hands, and chest as well as my face and neck it went rather rapidly and I could not afford to use it on a regular basis"
5,DermStore provides a great start ...,"Its nice when the ordering experience goes so well. Not only did DermStore provide FREE shipping with the most competitive price of the product, it arrived exactly on time (early actually), well packed with free sample products. I'll return with review of the product but for now confidently recommend this seller, thanks so much!"
5,Afirm 3x,"I used to get Retin A from my doctor, but ran out. Afirm 3X does the same thing and the tube is much bigger. A tiny amount goes a long way. My skin never got red, just started to dry a little and top layer of skin flaked off and nice healthy skin appeared. I will continue to use this product."
3,Blotchy - but at least not orange,"The key to using this sunless tanning spray is to pump the canister full of air after only 4-5 seconds of spraying. As the air runs out, the spray becomes like rain instead of a micro-mist as advertised. I am very fair and did not come out looking orange but rather a natural tan - except in places where the spray turned into droplets."
1,Should have looked harder,"This item is a piece of junk. Broke the first time I used it with minimal pressure. Even when it wasn't broken, it didn't do a good job of cleaning. If you are considering this purchase....don't."
3,Good Effort Anyway,"This movie wasn't too bad. Stiff acting, but most B or make that most horror fils have that. The ore fx were good. It had the classic ripping out of the gguts several times. The only effects that sucked were the gun effects. This kind of surprised me, but with the budget they probably didn't have the money for blanks. Definatly worth renting or maybe even picking up if you run across it used and cheap."
1,Sweet Merciful Crap!!!,"This movie is a standard zombie film that takes place in a prison. It's marred mainly by wooden acting and the oddly placed attempts at humorous dialogue. The direction and camera shots seem completely uninspired. Sometimes the camera operator can't seem to decide which character to focus on and the camera just floats back and forth between them. The camera work and direction seem amateurish at best. I watched this on a HDTV with an upscaling DVD player and I noticed that the whole movie seemed to be just a little out of focus. I'm not sure that's on purpose or if it was a problem with the upscaling.Bottom line is that while this is a watchable zombie movie, there are much better ones out there. Why waste the time on this one when there are movies like Severed: Forest of the Dead."
1,Good idea that was poorly executed. Sort of like Undead.,"If you liked Undead, this may be your cup of tea. If you are expecting 28 Days Later, or a Dawn of the Dead remake, this is NOT it. A great idea stuck in a bad movie. The acting was terrible and the editing\directing was a nightmare. The writing was no picnic either. AMAZING concept that should have had a bigger budget and better actors. Hollywood should not shy away from nasty horror like this. I so wanted this movie to be better. I don't think it got the treatment it deserved. Bigger budget, better acting\directing\writing, I think it could have been a sleeper hit like 28 Days Later if it had."
4,Next to Land of the Dead or Undead this is one of the best zombie movie of the year,"2005 must be the best year for zombie films since Land of the Dead,Undead,and Dead Men Walking are the best zombie films I've ever seen. A plague in zombie blood causes people to turn into zombies. The setting is in a prison and prisoners get contaminated and turn into bloodthirsty zombies. The gore in the movie is excessive and there's plenty of it including guts being ripped out,hands being turn off,zombies being shot in the heads and blood spilling on white walls,and other gore that gorehounds will love. The plot is basically similar to 28 Days Later and the remake of Dawn of the Dead.Dead Men Walikng is the 3rd best zombie movie of the year or ever.Also recommended: Undead,Land of the Dead,Dead Alive,Zombi,Dawn of the Dead(1978),Day of the Dead."
4,Over-the-top Appreciation of Rural Scenery,"This is a visually fabulous coffee-table book about livestock, barns, trees, fields, vegetables, and farming implements. It's sort of a photographic companion to ""Charlotte's Web."" Rural life has never looked so gorgeous as it does in this book. There are no people in this countryside, no grime, and certainly no dead cars or junk in yards or on sagging porches. (Caution to carnivores: Once you have studied the beautiful and soulful farm animals and their young, you will not want to eat meat again.) Barns, birch trees, fences, snow -- everything is perfect. This is a strange book, one that idealizes the Northeast countryside so powerfully that it's a little strange, really. Best enjoyed by city slickers."
4,Really? Refurbed?,"Having never owned a refurbished tool before - and having purchased this impact driver as a test of sorts - I was very surprised to find a completely brand new everything. The case, the tool itself, batteries and charger had nary a scratch one. Even smelled new!For the negs: the power is a bit on the weak side, due to the 12-volts, I would imagine, and I really don't like the light on the hook. The hook can't be in the ""to hang"" position if you need the light, and vice versa. Can't say I much care for handle either. Not enough angle between it and the chuck(?), and it's all fat at the bottom. You know, where your hand kinda gets smaller what with the little pinky fingers, and all. However, for the pos: re-charge time for the battery is about 15 minutes, and the little guy sure does punch above his weight. I've used mine to drive wood screws ranging from 1 1/4"" to 3"" all day, and (even with all the battery swapping) I still am content, and would buy this Hitachi driver again!"
5,The sailor's companion.,"Hiscock's classic text on long distance cruising has been the bible of long distance sailors for two or three generations now. What it lacks in the latest gadgets it makes up for with decades of experience and knowledge of the subject. The safety at sea section alone is worth the price. Chapters include ropes and rope work, masts and sails (cruising sails, not racing sails), accommodations and living on board, passages and navigation. Unless you already have a decade of long distance sailing behind you this is a valuable book."
3,Still a good reference book,Although now dated it is still a good reference book worthy of a presence in any yachties library. It demonstrates the authors significant experience sailing.
5,You MUST own this book!,"This is quite simply the greatest collection of non-stat related information on Baseball ever! If you love Baseball, you MUST own this book!"
5,a beautiful blend of beats & blips & vocals,EOST have changed a whole lot since their early guitar-noise debut. This newest disc resides somewhere on a spectrum between the melodic indietronica of MÃºm and Bjork's 'Vespertine' disc. It combines contemporary electronic blips & bleeps but also organic instrumentation as well. A beautiful disc!
3,Modem review,I was unable to link up with the ISP address even after calling my ISP provider and telling them the problem.
3,Went back well,"This Modem proved to be incopatible with my computer. However, their return service was excelent and speedy."
2,Would have been a good juvenile novel,"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. And I regret it because I really enjoyed one of her previous books. This one was too far-fetched and I could not suspend disbelief.The plot plodded along and didn't go anywhere. The characters for the most part were sketched out OK, but none of them struck me as sympathetic and it was difficult to tell what was going on at the Hill. Major ironclad CIA/FBI training hideaway? or old folks' home?Bizarre at best."
2,Disappointing...not what I hoped for.,"The scientific experiment funded by the FBI to give agents the ability to live inside the mind of a serial killer in order to understand how he thinks and what he might do next sounded good on paper. Unfortunately it may have worked too well. The project is cancelled.Former agent Arden was part of this experiment.Her parents are murdered and the killer is sentenced to be executed. Right before he dies though he confesses that while he is guilty of many other killings, he did not killer Arden's parents.Arden is given this information about the same time she finds out that the cancelled project may still be going on.It's up to her to find out who the real killer is, what effect the faulty project may have had on her while stopping an on-going killing spree.This book jumped around a lot and not in a good way. It was difficult to follow at times. Not a great read."
1,A Disturbing Read,I have read and enjoyed many of this authors works. But this one was disturbing. The heroine was so messed up mentally that I found her unlikeable. The hero was so one dimensional that I did not feel as if I even got to know him. And the tank program was downright creepy. I also thought the ending was unrealistic. Skip this one and read something else.
1,Before I wake,"What rubbish.If I ever see a book by Anne Frasier again it will be too soon.No matter how hard I tried i had to skip chapters all the time and like an endless soapy tv drama,you still knew what was happening or in this case not happening~the author seems to be stuck on nothing~horrible read."
2,Disappointed,These stools came with a pattern on the cushion not shown in the picture or description.
2,Poor Documentation,"This is my first time using Act! and I am pretty dissapointed. The program is probably pretty powerful, but I can't get to that point yet with the documentation provided.They could learn a thing or two from Peachtree. Not that Peachtree is a contact manager, but if you wonder ""How do I pay a bill with a credit card card?"", you can bet Peachtree doesn't just say ""Do this from the bill paying area"" like Act!'s help would. It would litterally walk you through the steps of setting up the account and even provide examples.Act! doesn't even manage to describe all it's own fields neverless do a good job of setting up your own.So if you buy this program, add an Act! for Dummies or similar book to your shopping cart also."
2,Any software that has its own community of consultants...,"If you thought Adobe Illustrator has too many bells and whistles, you haven't tried ACT! So many seemingly reasonable people raved about how great it is that I invested the ..., and now find it to be unpenetrable. And I'm no Luddite: I'm a software product manager from DBMS days. Any product that isn't intuitive is poorly designed. Sure, you can turn anything that's painfully learned into a cult, but managing one's contacts should be no more than a tedious chore -- not a religion complete with mysteries, mantras, revelations, stigmata... and its own set of anointed priests, A.K.A. consultants!"
3,Not for large trucks!,We ordered this particular item for a Dodge 2500 and the visor is much too large to fit appropriately.The cost was so close to shipping that we didn't bother on the return and are using it in another vehicle. It serves it's purpose but doesn't look very slick. Worth the money.
2,Choose another book instead,"For what this book tries to accomplish, there are much better books: Encountering the Chinese, by Hu Wenzhong et al, and Communicating Effectively With the Chinese, by Ge Gao and Stella Ting Toomey. These books deliver far more insight, wisdom and analysis. If you're looking for a Reader's Digest/Family Circle/Parade Magazine treatment of the issue, however, then this book is your best choice: it's light and thin."
5,Fantastic Kitten Toy,I gave this to my 6 month old kitten yesterday when I got home from work. He absolutely loved it. As soon as I put it on the ground he was batting the ball around the circle. He didn't even give me a chance to put Catnip in the center part for him. He played for 20 minutes and then I left to go to the store. When I got home an hour later he was still playing with it! I have never seen him take to a toy so quickly or remain interested in one for more than 5 minutes. I will have to buy another one of these and maybe some replacement flashy balls. I just know while I am away at work all day he will wear himself out playing with this. At least I know he isn't bored anymore when he is home alone.
2,Not comfy,It does not work for me. It rise on the waist and pinch my neck. I think because of that it makes me bend my neck and strains it. I still slouch. It is better when u stand then sit.
4,Not bad....,"I have Shpresa's two other dvds and have found they work. I am sore after I use them. Shpresa is a good instructor. Not annoying at all. The best way I can describe this dvd is a meditation with a workout at the same time. Overall, it is a decent workout dvd for those days where you need to take it easy/relax but still get a decent workout."
5,Terrific Introduction to a Thesaurus,"I used this book with groups of English as a Second Language students in fifth and sixth grades. I thought it was a marvelous introduction to what a thesaurus is and how to use one. The book is only 86 pages long and uses easily readable print font, so it is not intimidating at all and really helps to promote confidence. My students loved it!"
5,A Perfect Read for the Movie Fan,"As a long time movie fan, I, like most, am aware of those actors who have been the ""winners"" of the major categories given at the Academy Awards. However, I did not realize the superb list of ""losers"" who did not collect the coveted statues. This fine reference work by Roy Pickard provides an excellent assessment of the distinguished recipients and the ""also-rans."" It is chocked full of amusing profiles and anecdotes about actors and film. The true movie fan who remembers such film stalwarts as Thelma Ritter, Broderick Crawford, Eve Arden, and Beah Richards will enjoy reading this book for they-and many others receive their just due."
5,I wish I had had this book twenty years ago!,"Groundbreaking! This woman knows what writers are like and shows how to begin to break through some of the difficulties which are inherent to many writers/artists in achieving their products. Her analysis is especially poignant for those ""blocked"" by personal issues which prevent the action (writing, painting, interpersonally relating) needed to achieve their life's goals."
1,Didn't help me,"This book is primarily focused on trying to determine the underlying cause of procrastination, which the author feels relates to feelings of shame. There is little space given to solving procrastination.An approach like this might be of interest to some people suffering from procrastination, but I didn't find it useful.She uses an exercise repeatedly which involves writing with both hands. She says you will get different responses from your dominant and nondominant hands, which is supposed to give you greater insight into your problems. An example:Dominant HandWhen I think of solitude, I think ____________When I think of solitude, I feel ____________Nondominant HandWhen I think of solitude, I think ____________When I think of solitude, I feel ____________I think this exercise is unhelpful, and I feel annoyed every time I encounter it in this book."
3,"Funny, insightfull, sometimes to wordy","Karen E. Peterson certainly has a story to tell and that is what she does. If you are just interested in the topic in general you will find a good start. If you are happen to be or want to be a writer you bought the right book. It is encouraging and funny. And it can help to get you going but that is about the end of it. Where she should get into detail she recommends other books, she very much keeps on the surface. She tries but to express emotions empathetically she sucks. All in all a good introduction."
4,Theological and Practical depth,"Dr. MacArthur continues to expound on God's Word with theological and practical depth. This commentary is not just academic, although it certainly fills the bill in that area, but it also reveals the majesty of the Messiah and what it means to our lives.It's cliche, but even if you don't consider yourself a theologian this commentary is a good read, at any level.I was looking for notes that dug into the text a bit deeper then my study Bible, but did not want to go to the extent of ""high seminary academics"" so to speak. MacArthur's explanations are thorough, but accessible filling in details of history, culture, and where necessary the Greek roots of the text."
1,"Same old, same old","I think Ms. Bliss has run out of ideas. I've been disappointed with the last several books and this is just more of the same. There are a few new patterns (e.g., a little jumper and a bathrobe), but most are just recycled versions of the same old thing. Look through the books you already have. There was nothing new in this book that I would make."
4,A beauiful addition to any knitting library,"I think this is a great book to add to any knitter's library. There is a good selection of simple patterns and then some more complicated for people looking for color kniting or something more chalenging. There are accesories in this book that make wonderful gift ideas. The padded hanger covers are darling and if sized up would be great for hanging adult sweaters, also. So, if you look there's something for everyone as long as you're willing to re-write and alter patterns.The only downside is there are no diagrams to show finished measurements."
5,BuenÃ­simo,"Tiene muchos diseÃ±os muy padres y modernos no solo en ropa, tambiÃ©n en accesorios, buenacomra, soy mismo empiezo a tejer!!"
4,Wizards,Dresden is a real wizard with all the foils of a wizard living in a human and wizard world. Wish they had made more than one season. Son tells me there are books too. Characters are believable and Dresden is a good wizard.
5,Engaging plots and special effects,"These short episodes are a quick fix for the lack of fantasy on SciFy. After I saw all the Dr. Who's available and the Torchwood series, I found this when looking for something similar. Sadly, only one season was ever produced. I have watched only 4 episodes so far and have been entertained by all."
5,Very surprised,"I watched this with some hesitation. Since there were not many episodes, I assumed this was one of those shows that got canceled because it was not very good.However, I really enjoyed Dresden. Dresden is a wizard and tries to help individuals who may be normal or something else like a vampire, ghost, etc. There are flashbacks to his childhood, a love interest, forces who want him dead and other mysteries that make it interesting."
5,truly an excellent scifi series,"i actually watched the series before the books and now i'm hooked on both, i highly recommend this excellent example of the genre and a complete disapointment that this wonderful show has been cancelled."
1,"Love Dresden books, hate this series, it's terrible.","Stories re-written, casting completely off base, who knows what some Hollywood schmuck was thinking when they created this series......""lets take a great series of books and turn it into a mis-casted, poorly written and poorly acted tv series then watch it fail miserably"".........seems to come to mind. This is a completely different animal than the books, so, if you've watched this and thought (like many) 'this sucks' fear not, the books are 100 times better."
1,Does not match quality of the book series,"I was genuinely disappointed. I could understand that Bob the Skull is now Bob the see through person, but why replace the blue beetle with a black truck, or the oh so cool cloak with a crappy jacket? Murphy at least is cute and short, albeit brown instead of blonde.The show does not do the books justice, and the viewer is hopelessly lost in the plotlines.Instead of elaborating on some of the stories that the books leave open (hello car eaten out by some sorta bugs down to the steel?), it tries to condense ""Storm Front"" into a single episode. They should've tried to just go with smaller story arcs, and leave a bigger story arc over the entire season.I can only desperately hope for a remake that does the books justice."
1,Don't waste your money,"This series failed as a TV show for one main reason: it failed to grip the imagination well. They gutted most of the elements that makes the books so charming and gripping, as TV networks often do, in their oh-so tepid attempts to broaden the appeal of the show to gain more viewers. What SF channel failed to realize is they could have made this a very popular SF show a la Battlestar Galactica by getting talented writers, producers with some imagination and let them run free with little interference and make some really memorable, striking storylines.Instead we got Harry Dresden lite, and this show died an early death. I watched the entire series on TV and ended up forcing myself to watch the last few episodes, groaning most of the way through. I am disappointed on many levels as the books are excellent and I was very excited to see them develop them into a serialized TV show, but the show failed to capture the magic of the books."
4,"Style, imagination, and wit.","The Dresden Files was a wonderfully entertaining series with an outstanding ensemble cast. Paul Buckthorne as the witty Harry Dresden and Terrence Mann as his ""oh so"" British sidekick ghost had their roles nailed. Together they had a humerous tit for tat ""buddy"" relationship that was enjoyable to watch. The other regulars--Morgan, Murphy, and her skeptical lieutenant detective--were also strongly written characters and beautifully portrayed.As the series progressed and the writers settled in, the scripts got better. Given a little more time, the Dresden Files could have become a classic. Why the Sci-Fi Channel canceled the show is a complete mystery to me and the thousands of other Dresden fans. (Have you seen their Flash Gordon series? Snzzzzz!)The Dresden Files had style, imagination, and wit. It was a must-see."
3,The Dresden Files,"I have watched these DVDs, but have read all of Jim Butcher's works. SF Channel could have done so much more. Instead they allowed a slightly bumbling man in the lead role. I remember seeing on the DVD that the producers didn't want to emphasize magic. Who are they kidding? Don't they know that the series is based on magic, serious magic? Didn't they realize the success of Harry Potter was the magic? Butcher is excellent in his characterizations, but Sci Fic channel blew it. Instead, we have really horrible stuff, like ""Ghost Hunters"" and ""Do You Want to Be a Superhero?"" Give me a break."
4,Don't bother with the books.,"I have to agree with those that said the TV show was better than the books. Although the TV show wasn't a 5 star show, either. I had to force myself to finish the first book, it was so bad, and I wound up flipping pages to get through it. I have no idea how anyone can bother to recommend the books. In fact, I'll actually say if you like the show, steer clear of the books. The show actually tries to make Dresden somewhat likeable. In the book, he was just a self-loathing bum who I couldn't even be bothered to feel sorry for. In the TV show, he's still that, but at least I can empathize with him.Still, the show does bring a somewhat unique concept and does it pretty well. Some of the motivations aren't clear (although, I found them worse in the book, because they were explained and I found everyone to be hypocritical.)One of my favorite things about the show vs the books, though, has to be that I'm only wasting 45 minutes, not 4 hours. Yes, they're short."
2,Average tv show that took too many liberties,"I will admit that I watched every episode of this show when it originally aired on the Sci-Fi channel. I knew nothing of the Dresden Files, Harry Dresden nor Jim Butcher. The one good thing about this show is that it made me start reading Butcher's incredibly fun and entertaining novels, something that essentially the tv show did not capture. This show took alot of liberties with Butcher's Dresdenverse and in some cases made outright changes to the characters themselves. I personally am happy to see the show go away, and my hope is that eventually someone will come along and write (maybe Butcher himself) a suitable screenplay that truly captures his vision. Maybe one day it will make it to the big screen. But if it doesnt, he has written over 10 incredibly rich and incredibly entertaining novels that should keep new and existing fans happy."
1,Not what I expected.,"I love the books that this series are based on. I was very excited when I say that a series was based on the books. That being said, after watching the first session it's easy to see why it wasn't picked up for a second. The description on the DVD should have said it was very loosely based on the books. I was very disappointed in the show and I would not recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed the books. It was a disappointment."
5,Original,"This series that originally aired on Sci-Fi channel was very original. It's a real shame they cut it before it really got a chance to gain a following. It wasn't put in the most viewer friendly slot to begin with considering it's target audience age groups. It was a good series, with a good premise and some very original characters. It's worth the time. I was happy to add it to my collection of series TV shows that have to do with Magic and Mayhem."
5,Was Greatly Supprised To See How Great The Show Was,I actually never saw this show when it first aired on the sci-fi channel the only reason I checked it out was some friends at work read the books this series was based on and told me how great it was. After seeing a few episodes I immediately decided to order this set it reminded me a great deal of the X-files combined with a much darker Harry potter theme. I was sad to say this great show only went up to twelve episodes I wish there could have been more. I do recommend to viewers that some of these episodes are very hardcore and while not extremely gory they are still bloody. That aside I would say to any person thinking about this to look at some of the episodes and see if you truly wish to buy this but I will tell you now I think it is definitely worth it.
5,lives for magic,"i had seen this series when it was on scifi and liked it so it just made since to buy the dvd set when it was released.i really like the character of harry dresden,i really think they could have done more with the underlying relationship between harry and the high council.its a shame they didn't try to do at least one more season and give people a better chance to get to know the characters."
5,The Dresden Files TV Show...,A great Television program brought to you by and later canned by Sci-Fi Channel/NBC. The ratings were great and the fan base is huge. To bad the people at NBC can't bet on a sure thing.The acting and cast were superb. The locations were beautiful to see. The story lines were entertaining. Great mix of acting and special effects.
5,A great one season hit,"This was a great show about Harry Dresden (Paul Blackthorne), a modern day wizard. He assisted Lt. Murphy (Valerie Cruz) of the Chicago police department with cases that defied human explanation. Those cases included vampires, werewolves, reanimated corpses, a dragon, etc. The special effects were good and the show filled that ""supernatural"" void that T.V. programming lacks. I'm happy the series is out on CD as I'll watch the shows over and over again.This is one of the few programs I actually looked forward to seeing every week. Sadly, it was cancelled after the first season. Another stupid Sci-Fi decision. The series was popular with many people and in my opinion one of the best programs Sci-Fi had going for it."
5,Cancelled way too soon,"For some unknown reason I've seen quite a few good series terminated before they had a chance to prove themselves. Firefly and Blade are examples. Asides that, there was the moronification of the Alias storyline.It's a mystery to me why people would not want to watch an excellent series such as this. Strong characters, a world of background and every fantasy part has been assimilated in it. With the ascendance of fantasy in general in the last decades, stories such as these should at least get a chance to be seen."
3,LOVED THE BOOK LIKED THE DVD,"I may catch slack for this but let me start by saying I am not really into wizards and supernatural books per say. However, I started this series and almost literaly could not put it down. It is extremely well written and you really get into the characters. AS far as the dvd goes I won't go so far as to say I was disappointed because any one who has read the books knows that with so much going on it would be almost impossible to put on television. That being said, I think they really did a good job in putting the dvd together. There is not as much action and there is definetly a small cheese factor but the casting is good. harry in the dvd is almost excaclty as i would imagine him in real life. It doesn't follow the books very close in my opinion but once you realise that and accept it the dvd was pretty entertaining. If you have never read the books I wouldn't bother, but for the true die hard dresden filers you have no choice but to see it either way!"
5,left me wanting more,"I realy like this genere, \I LIKE THIS SERIES, I think the only reason it there isn't more of this series, was it's genere was ahead of it's time if it came on now I think you would find it more popular with the general public not just the novels traditional fans. I WOULD BY MORE IF THERE WAS ANY AS WOULD ANYONE IN MY HOUSEHOLD."
3,No where as good as the books,"The actor portraying the main character was good, but I thought the scripts and the directing were mediocre. Three stars is the best I could give."
5,Magical,"I caught the series on SciFi Channel during its initial run and was very disappointed when it was canceled. I can't recommend the Dresden Files highly enough though. Despite its relatively short run--13 episodes--it manages to charm you with its fun stories and lovable characters.Some will complain that it resembles the Joss Whedon show ""Angel"", but this is a misconception. In fact, tonally speaking, the shows are complete opposites. The Dresden Files is good natured fun, and good it is!"
4,I love what they did with Bob.,"I really enjoyed The Dresden Files TV series when it aired. At first I wasn't sure about the changes that had been made to some of the characters - especially Bob's - but now I can't imagine Bob any other way and he has become one of my favorite characters! As for this product, the quality of the DVDs was quite good, though I would have liked more ""extras"" and comments on the creation and filming of the episodes. Still I feel this DVD set was well worth the money."
5,Great series,"To bad only one season.This show never made it?? with all the other trash on?Very good!! I watched it several times and friend I lent it to also raved about it.Read the books, watch the series you'll not regreat it."
4,Been looking for this DVD,"We've been looking of and on for the is DVD for some time now... remember watching it on the Sci Fi channel some time ago, but it just left the air without any warning or explanation. Now that we are all caught up with season 1, it's too bad they didn't see the wisdom in making season 2. Highly recommend the book series!"
3,It's Ok,"So far it seems that every female actor is above-average-attractive, which nags my realistic-radar, but I can't blame the casting director. The stories are pretty good, some of the dialogues & character relationships lack originality, but overall I enjoy this show on a rainy day."
3,Read the books,"As a fan of the Dresden books I was interested to see how the television series panned out. Unfortunately, just as it was beginning to show potential it was cancelled. The first few episodes are interesting but there is something lacking and I am not sure I can put my finger on it.The acting was fine but I feel that if i hadn't read the series I might have enjoyed it more.With that being said there are some things from the series that are really neat.::*::Spoilers::*::Having Dresden use a hockey stick as a staff seemed fun, along with the drumstick wand. It made it more 'urban' in a way. Having Bob as a visual human was interesting as well. I love Bob from the books but Terrence Mann brought an unique aspect to him. Very dignified.In the end I'd have to say read the books - the imagery presented there is far superior. Though, the series may have become something if given more time."
3,Disappointment over production,Too bad the book series is fantastic and the video's hardly correspond to the source material at all. Dresden laying a vampire? Ain't going to happen.
1,Copy protection is getting ridiculous,"I bought this, quite frankly, to bring my order total over $25.00 to get free shipping. I had read a couple of the Jim Butcher books in e-book format and they weren't too bad. The movies, when I finally got the dvd to play on our TV's dvd player, were actually quite well done, if you like dark fantasy. My problem is with the ridiculous copy protect scheme on this dvd. I couldn't get it to play on my computer at all (Win XP Pro, SP3)after trying it on 3 different dvd player software suites and downloading several updated codec packs. Even the dvd player for our tv set had some problems with this disc."
1,If you DON'T think about the books it is an OK series.,"I am a HUGE Jim Butcher fan and have every book in the Dresden Files and well as the Codex Alera books. I love them all. I tried watching this when it first came out and hated it...mainly cause I was SO shocked at the watered down version of the books...so watered down as to be ALMOST but not quite unrecognizalbe. I have since tried watching it again and if I watch it on its own merit and forget the brilliant books it was based on...well there are STILL glaring problems, but these could have been overcome as with any new series kinks have to be worked out. I think it could have continued to grow and become even better. I actually enjoy it on its own merit. I think Sci Fi is extrememly stupid to take such a promising premise, ruin it, and then not even give it a decent chance. It really was a promising, well made show....too bad sci fi isn't as promising anymore...guess it isn't worth their time if it isn't really stupid and dumbed down."
1,Dallasite,"Not impressed. Shallow plots that have been recycled again and again...so nothing new or fresh. Lead actors NEVER stop arguing and retain their distrust and animosity throughout each episode..it gets old, fast. This is just not entertaining."
5,great TV adaptation,"I have read all the Jim Butcher novels and loved them. I didn't expect the series to be an exact duplicate, of course, but I was very pleased all the same-I think the spirit of Harry Dresden was captured well. Good entertainment."
5,"Even with a DVR, I planned my time to watch it!","Hello...this is my first review. I write in support of this great TV series both because I will purchase the DVDs, and in hopes that the series will continue for many years to come. I've read all the Harry Dresden books and found, for once, the books and the TV series do justice to each other. The actors are perfect for the roles. No TV series can exactly follow a book but this keeps the heart and soul of the world Jim Butcher built for Harry. The stories are appeal to that magic younger demographic but also to us beyond that simplistic boundary. And I hope the producers remember we have money to spend too. Why encourage continuing the TV series here on Amazon? This is where I will buy more series DVDs! I sincerely hope this program will be renewed."
3,Havent read the books but the series had potential,I thought these were good but not great mainly because the producers wanted the each episode to end after an hour - the great majority of these episodes could easily have gone for 2 - 3 hours which was my biggest disappointment.
2,Could be 3 stars for some,"The show, in a vacuum, still isn't very good. Inconsistent, mediocre writing, terrible production values. Not in a vacuum, it's terrible. How? By saying this is ""based on"" the books by Jim Butcher. Hardly...same names (mostly) same locations, and the existence of magic. That's it.If you like the Sci-Fi original movies, this will be fine. Don't compare it to Eureka or Battlestar, both of which beat it like a drum for writing, acting and production."
3,Warning-Missing Episode,"The Dresden Files is a unique take on magic and the occult, with a wizard [replete with uncle ghost resident in skull], who does double duty as a private investigator who mostly works for/with the police.Wonderful series, but for some reason, the producer of the DVD has left one episode out, a very good episode that preceded episode 10. I find no reference to that episode anywhere, not on Sci-fi.com, nor on any Dresden Files websites. It is continued in episode 10, so it would be nice to have that. With that warning, the DVD is well worth the purchase, merely disappointing that it is not complete."
3,Neat addition to the books!,"Before you watch the series, read at least three of Jim Butcher's books. It will give you something to base the series on and maybe explain Paul Blackthorne's bad acting. He tried and I think he was getting the hang of it near the end. This is only my opinion, of course. I love Terrance Mann's potrayal of 'Bob'. I think it was a great twist to the book's talking skull. The books are better but the series was neat. I only gave it three stars because it's neat seeing the characters come to life."
4,Something a little extra for the fans,"Q&A With Dean Martin is a re-release of two early SFK EPs (7 tracks), Answer to Both Your Questions and Dean Martin (3 tracks).Both were before their first album, Elsewhere for 8 Minutes, but the instensity of that release was obviously already there.Heavily rock based, with loud guitars and a great rhthym section, Q&A is a welcome addition to SFK's catalogue. Of course, the best part of the album is Paul Dempsey's lyrics, and the tortured voice which delivers them.Lyrics range from pondering everyday activites (""I used to tie double knots..."" on Clint) to anger at the way people treat others (All you can say is 'It's alright'...WRONG ANSWER'"" on the sensational Dean Martin).This release just reinforces SFK's talent, and it still confounds me as to why they aren't even more popular than they are. If your a fan, you cannot be without this album."
4,Something a little extra for the fans...,"Q&A with Dean Martin is a re-release of two early SFK EPs - Answer to Both Your Questions and Dean Martin.This was before ""Elsewhere for 8 Minutes"", but the intensity of that album is still there. Heavily rock based, with loud guitars and a great rhythm section, Q&A is a welcome addition for any SFK fan.The stand out, of course, is Paul Dempsey's lyrics and his almost tortured voice delivering them. The words range from pondering every day activities (""I used to tie double knots..."" on Clint) to anger at the way people treat others (""All you can say is 'it's alright'....Wrong Answer"" on the sensational Dean Martin).If you already have Answer to Both Your Questions, the three more tracks this EP provides (from a total of 10), will test your loyalty. If you don't, it's an essential and welcome addition to your collection"
3,It's just o.k.,"The dances are all right, but it is very hybrid. (Latin and Carribean) Not a lot of tru hip hop. It's would be difficult to follow for a non dancer. The videography is not conducive to learning the elements. It pans on dancers faces or torsos when it should be on the steps being demonstrated. For the price it's a good deal. If you really want to start learning hip hop get the Madonna Grimes dvds."
2,unhappy after I opened the box,Was very disappointed after opening the box and seeing that you had to design each page and then send it out to be made for an Additional Cost!!!
5,The Jerome Biblical Commentary,"I found the Commentary in excellent condition, and it's just what I was looking for. The price can not be beat."
2,Disappointing,"Using the name Jerome was misleading from the beginning. This is NOT writing from Jerome, but a very high-brow scholar's presentation. I do not see how this is a ""commentary"" on the Bible. I was very sorry I bought this book."
5,Wonderful book that hold a lot of secrets,I found out a lot about Grace Kelly that I didn't know before. This has shown me some other sides of this actress turned princess. This is a wonderful biography. I enjoyed reading it.
1,too commercial,"never heard any poor righteous teachers ish, but i copped this one after hering him on the snowgoons ish. cant get enuff of that track! so now i got an eye on him and i see this album. copped it and listened. immediately, the intro makes u want more, but it just doesnt happen. wack, straight wack yo. too commercial for this cat, just my 2cents tho. got to be a fan to appreciate i guess. and im NOT. however, this album does not affect the integrity of that ish he did wit snowgoons. peace"
4,Excellent Doll,"This version of Drew is one of the prettiest dolls I have ever seen. The red hair is lovely and it feels great, too. Her outfit is good and the purse goes great with it, a perfect accessory. If anyone likes the Fashion Fever collection they should buy this one."
2,He has great potential but for now...,"I grimmaced at first when I saw the subject matter. This sort of internet urban myth plotline usually seems kind of pathetic, but Baer is a strong writer. At times the images and the language deserve the highest of praise, but overall the writing seems too calculated. I think he definitely is a writer to watch, and the last line was one of the more memorable in years, but as a book on its own I think the characters are a bit too involuntarily cartoonish for me to love this book. I think Baer might write an incredible book oneday, I hope he does, cuz he's a truly gifted writer, much more talented then basically every under-thirty or so writer out there except eugenides. So good luck baer, and to anyone who thought reservation road or any of those other discover books were good, you should be taken out back and shot. Baer deserves to win based on being the only ""talent"" of the bunch. Nonetheless, not a great book, but I have lots of hope for him in the future..."
3,It just didn't click for me ...,"First off I didn't identify with the characters in the book and I think that would be a normal thing given the characters, but in the end I think a good book should lend one to identify with the relationships between the characters. That's common ground that makes any book interesting, but unfortunately that didn't happen. There is a love story between the two that felt more like the ice in the magic cooler. I never made it to what is actually in the cooler but I'm guessing its the missing gun ... I hope the plot twists are not so simple in the book and I may never know. I made it about half way and it was pretty much a play it by the numbers deal. Anyway, maybe I'll finish it later, but I've moved on for now."
4,You've got to be kidney me.,"I am a huge fan of Chuck Palahniuk, Augusten Burroughs, Neal Pollack. While this book was as dark as any of the author's works I've mentioned, there was just something ""ugly"" about this book. It is well written, although the edition I borrowed was poorly edited (at least two typos). The kidney....believable.....the relationship between Mr. Kidney and Jude was not. But then he did seem to have a deathwish. I read that Mr. Baer is working a screen play for this book. The book definately reads like a vivid, raw film and will be a success. I like to snort laugh with my darkness....this book just was not funny. I felt like I needed a shower afterwards...or....wander into a foaming drive thru car wash."
2,So -So,"Sat through this book and it was really a waste of time. Try out Craig Clevenger or the obvious Chuck Palauhniuk. Story is boring, writing is extremly plain, the only briefly worth while part was the picture of the girl on the cover, thanks for nothing Baer!"
2,"contrived, tedious, and too many typos!!!","I read this book based on a recommendation, and it was the worst book I have read this year. The characters, including Phineas, are superficial and Hollywoodish. Every sentence feels contrived, like Will Christopher Baer and his editor sat in a hotel room in Las Vegas and placed the most random, arbitrary words together to form a meaningless(ful?!) sentence.The last ten chapters contain so many typos, I wonder if the author even proof-read it himself.I love a book filled with foreshadowing and symbols, but most of the effort is hollow in this novel."
1,Awful,"After the first chapter, I was disgusted,almost angered by how awful this book was. Cliche? Yep. Predictable, lazy writing? You betcha. I typically don't write book reviews on Amazon but I had to go out of my way inform my fellow readers out there how awful this book was. Avoid"
1,"Ponderous, pedantic, and pretentious","It's not so much that this novel is both immoral and grotesque (which it is), but that the love that is supposed to bind it together is so preposterous as to make the novel unreadable. I found myself giving up around page 100, frustrated by the all-too-precious prose and the absurd idea of a man who's had his kidney removed by a woman only to fall in love with her. I don't know about you, but there's only so far I can stretch a metaphor. Take away my kidney, and that's where I draw the line.UPDATED: It was very interesting to see how all the bad reviews of this novel received multiple unhelpful votes while none of the good reviews did. I wonder who the voters are? Can you say author's friends and family?"
3,"Debut effort strong, but lacking humanity","Will Christopher Baer's first novel certainly has style. It even had a nugget of substance. But what it lacks, and needs most desperately to succeed, are characters the reader can not only believe, but actually care about. Halfway through the book, I stopped wondering (or caring) whether or not the (anti-)hero even got his kidney back. Between all the lies, hallucinations and casual (pointless) violence, it's next to impossible to suspend disbelief. And without that, it's almost an exercise of will to complete the book. What makes it easy is the stylish present-tense prose that occasionally sweeps up the reader -- until you slam into a brick of improbability. I guess it wouldn't have been such a problem if the book were put in the ""fantasy"" section of the book store."
5,As good as this...,"One shouldn't have to wait so long to read books as good as this. Baer's prose is as exruciatingly clean as the snow falling over Denver, falling onto cars, falling past the streetlights -- dark, sweet shimmering sentences, like candy that could kill you. When is this guy's next book coming out? Who is this guy? Great!"
3,Entertaining,"Kiss Me, Judas is an entertaining book. It is only a three star book because of its faux grittiness. It tries too hard to justify the actions of the characters. I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't rationalized every detail and let the characters develop without imposing a sense of justice. I would recommend the book despite the gritty veneer."
4,death and sex,"Death and sex, pain and pleasure, let me count the ways I love this book. Kiss Me Judas is a dark thriller that will leave you feeling rubbed raw with your heart in your gut. When you read this book you will feel like you are the characters, dealing with their emotions. WCB is a wonderfully dark author that will make you beg: ""Thank you sir, may I have another""."
3,"Worth reading; dark, broody ,,,poignant","I think anyone else's review will be fine here. I just wanted to point out that I own the set of three matching covers (black, green, white) and enjoyed the book just fine, but was appalled to see ""Kiss me, Judas"" had in the upwards of 45 typos. The most shocking part was that this is republished and not even the original edition, which would've been acceptable. But you'd thnk they'd have worked out 45 typos (I quit counting) by the time a trilogy is reprinted as a set. Either way give it a read; it doesn't hinder the story."
5,Always loved This tv series,"Saved by the bell tv series is a must have if you collect DVD or if you grew up during this time periodAll the actors are great, funny. I will never get bored watching any episode"
3,For die-hard Saved by the Bell fans only!,"Saved by the Bell - Hawaiian Style and Wedding in Las Vegas is a so-so collection. Both of these short t.v. movies are good but not great like the College Years or the original show. The style and look of these movies are strange and slow, the chemistry seems forced as well. Only purchase this if you can't live without these fun-loving pals. Enjoy!"
5,At last the SBTB movie!,"Anybody who is a fan of the original series has been waiting for this release. Finally, we can own all the SBTB,almost. It should be noted that the Hawaian movie was actually the last thing filmed with the original cast before the Tori episodes of season five. This is a great little escape when you're feeling down and out in the real world. And at last, for those who got the College Years box can finally endcap the series with Wedding in Las Vegas, as the gang has some hijinks in the city that never sleeps and finally we see Zack and Kelly get hitched. Even Jessie and Belding show up! Now if only Liongate would release thoe Junior year episodes with Miss Bliss...hint hint."
4,die hards,"If you are a die hard ""Saved by the Bell"" fan then this is a must! I loved it! I loved having resolution on the romance of Zach and Kelly.If you are not a die hard, however, this may not be worth your dollar because it only has the two episodes and costs just as much as two entire seasons."
5,Just like buying a new movie from a store,"This was a great movie, no commercials, was in great condition. Very easy to buy and receive"
1,Boooooring......,I have had this book for over 2 years and just cannot finish it. I am halfway through and I can hardly remember anything. I struggled to get to the middle of the book. Stay away from this one. The book just seems to repeat the details and doesn't give you hard facts. I don't ever think I will finish this one!
5,Get the best to begin with,"I don't write many reviews, but the Fluke 73 is such a workhorse, so reliable, so accurate, so simple to use, that I had to take keyboard in hand. Do yourself a favor, instead of buying three less expensive devices on the way to getting this, just buy it to begin with---I wish I had. I've had mine more than ten years, and aside from a couple of 9V battery replacements (and they were prophylactic) NOTHING goes wrong. The device has the good sense to turn itself off when I forget.You will decide which probes (sensor tips) to get, but again, I wish I'd popped for the kit that has most of them in the first place. I think this is one of the two or three most valuable items in my garage. My uses are primarily automotive."
3,"A little dated now, the 179 is a better buy","I recently purchased one of these meters and was very happy with it - built very, very nicely. But then found Fluke is replacing it with the 179 so i returned the 73 and bought the 179 - a much better meter for only a little more money."
3,"Attractive book, longer than necessary.","The artwork is great, and many of the ideas are useful. What I didn't like was the tables based on hands the author held, not really reader-friendly, and not exactly scientific. Some strategy isn't explained fully. For instance it's explained how to ""trap a Jack,"" but it isn't explained why one should expect his opponent to save a Jack as his last card in the first place. Most players play off their high cards early, and hang onto low ones. Thus it would be more useful to discuss trapping a low card than a Jack. Trapping 5's is discussed, and makes much more sense, as players do hold onto 5's frequently. These are minor points however. There aren't a lot of cribbage books out there, and this one is entertaining, if more expensive than most."
4,Great backpacking tent for 2 people,"Ditto most of what you already read.I just returned from an overnight to Linville Gorge and it was 24 F. It did a good job trapping heat with the full length fly.I found the size perfectly adequate for me a my buddy - both with full length Thermarest pads. No overlap. We're both about 5'10"".Only issue was that I was not able to get the tent very tight lengthwise across the top. The ceiling sagged a bit. The fly was tight, just not the tent.This may have been my fault though. I will try again setting it up and take more time to perfect it.Overall very pleased with it. Especially for the low weight and price!"
4,Very nice Tent,"When i received the tent i must say i was impressed with how light the package was. I set up the tent on my deck. It was very very easy to set up, two polls which go through two netted slips. The rain fly is also very easy to install and set up. Very light and simple, looks strong also. Will see this season as i am camping on mt shasta.Pros- Lightweight, Easy installation, Nice polls, good price, seems sturdyCons- *MADE IN CHINA* , Floor seems like it needs reinforcement tarp, cheap stakesOverall i think this is a fair prices all around good tent for backpacking. I think it will be a good addition to my setupUPDATE* - Tent actually ended up leaking first time set up in rain. Could have sent back for another one but ended up spending a little more and buying alps chaos (AWESOME TENT) Freestanding is a must."
2,Not worth it...,"It's a shame. I really like this tent, particularly the size and ease of setup. But, the rain fly is poorly designed. There are two small plastic see-through windows in the fly and after a couple of times used, the plastic windows tore. It started with small cracks that eventually just ripped when pulled tight. Not sure why the windows are needed where they are but you are better off choosing a different tent with a better design for the fly."
2,Not for windy conditions,"I tried setting up this tent in windy conditions on the beach and it was close to impossible to set up. The stakes aren't that thick so they kept coming out of the sand whereas other tents I owned the stakes were thick enough to hold firmly. If your camping on hard ground or in not so windy conditions, I'm sure it will meet your expectations. I agree with other reviewers that it states 2-3 people but its definitely 1, maybe 2 and thats sleeping pretty close to each other. Other than those two holdups, the tent will meet peoples expectations of a lightweight, small, single man tent."
5,The Best Ever,I used this Tent over 20 times. In the heat 90's temp kept us cool with the fly doors opened it caught the air. In the frog strangling rain it kept us dry. And in the winter it closed up well to keep us warm temps around 20. And light weight I packed in on the Appalachain Trail for 5 days. Will not leave home with out it.. I bet I have sold more friends on this tent someone should pay me.LOL. You can not go wrong for the price...
4,Lite and fast,First time I set up this tent it was easy and fast. Went on a few trips and still love it. It is very lite and packs away nice in my pack.
4,Tent review,"This is my first backpacking tent. I bought it based on the good reviews and product info. The tent was so easy to set up, no directions needed. I like the carry bag because it gives you extra room to work with instead of trying to perfectly fold and roll the tent to fit the bag precisely. The wedge design is very nice as you can point it toward the wind to reduce it's effect on the tent. The only drawback is the size. I thought it would be bigger than it really is. The taper of the tent causes my feet and my wifes to be squooshed together and its difficult for us to sleep like that. My opinion is that it is a one person tent."
5,Worked Great,"Bought this for my Scout. I went on the trip with him. Scotchgaurded it prior as I always do to outdoor equipment. Had heavy rain. Bone dry inside. I wouldn't say this is a two man tent for men. Two kids or one adult and a child fit great. Very easy to put up. My Scout is 11, and he did it first try.OK it is now 8/2011 and tent has been used many times in all weather and still would give it 5 stars. While is more of a one man if used by adult, I have used with son together. Sturdy and have had no issues. Would def buy again. Taking it to Philmont next. Pack weight is 5 lbs but if used by two can split weight."
5,A wild modern fantasy/horror with a blues soundtrack,"Well, I first read this book about 5 years ago, when I came across it in the bookstore I managed. I was intrigued, and it was on sale, so I figured what the heck. It is, by far, one of my most favourite books, as it blends a modern fantasy borrowing heavily from catholocism, voodoo, santeria, and incorporates the mystic legends behind the Delta Blues. It's the story of Robert Johnson (real life blues legend) who, with his dying breath, endangers all of the world by breaking the Eye of the World. As the story progresses, Robert and several others band together to try to save the world from becoming Hell. Add to it a bunch of musical legends, including Elvis, and you've got a great book."
2,"Starts good, but progresses into the complex topics in a convoluted way","The book starts pretty good, explains a lot of basic stuff in simple language. Where things start getting bad is when the author takes a nasty personal attack at some economists he does not like. Delves into the personal lives in uncharacteristic fashion for any economics author.The other aspect that rubbed me the wrong way is he is not able to explain complex but remarkable stuffs of the 80s and 90s pushed through in simple language. It gets frustrating when convoluted sentences are used to explain it. I stopped reading the book at around page 200."
4,More Great Performances,"I am so happy to see that this sequel is out there. I hope that they keep putting them out over and over. I actaully like this one more than the first. I am crazy about Patty LuPone and she is phenomenal as usual.This is one to watch again and again.The only thing I didn't care for much were the interviews, which I found to be very light weight and not adding much to the show. But, that is a small quibble in something so valuable."
4,"Some treasures, indeed...","I purchased this DVD specifically to see and have a copy of the late, great Gregory Hines' performance in ""Jelly's Last Jam"". While I found the camera work on that number, which was captured at a Tony Awards show,to be frustrating--as it moved several times during Mr. Hines' actual dancing to (inexplicably) capture expressions on the faces of other cast members, thereby missing the true artistry that was unfolding courtesy of Mr. Hines' dancing--at least part of the performance is preserved for posterity. However, I was rewarded with other performance gems I wouldn't have otherwise seen, including the incomparable Katherine Hepburn as Coco Chanel. If you enjoy Broadway musicals, the clips contained herein are worth seeing/having."
1,Not An Arabic songs,"This cd contain no Arabic songs all is there is kind of noise and drums, and from the spoken words i can tell that the person singing in the cd is from Moroco but i couldnt understand what he is saying . As an Arab i believe that we have a great music tradition and if you intrested in Arbic music and songs look for the famous singers in the Arab world like Um- Kalthoum , Abdulhaleem Hafez or Fairouz."
5,Must Have Guide,"Jeff Wilson, a Buddhist who practices in the Pure Land tradition, has written an indispensable guide to Buddhist practice in New York City...His book is very reader friendly and gives a tremendous feel for all the various places to practice which are available in the tri-state area...the book is a must have for both the experienced practitioner who wants to have a guide and the new practitioner who is looking for a sangha..."
5,Esclarmonde reissued,"The score of Esclarmonde is full interesting and exotic music that is beautifully performed on this recording. A lot of the music does not sound like anything else I have ever heard. Among the many highlights are the invocation scene at end of the first act, the entire second act, the flying scene and finale of the third act, and the epilogue. As a bonus, the sound quality is superb; but this low priced set does not include the text."
4,Children will be Enchanted,"""Pushing Up the Sky"" is a collection of seven plays for children that are created from the myths and stories of seven different American Indian tribes. The plays are easy to produce and will hold children, as well as adult audiences, spellbound. The illustrations by Teresa Flavin are delightful and beautifully intricate. My favorite story in the collection is about two sisters who marry two stars in the sky. There is also an adorable story about an inquisitive ant who asks all the animals to tell him who is the strongest. The American Indian flavor of these plays are evident, and will add a unique spin on typical children's theatre. Some plays even include American Indian language, phonetically spelled out for the young actors. This book of plays is a gem for directors of children's theatre. I suggest anyone that works with elementary level children, or is interested in American Indian mythology, to go out and get this book today."
1,Sporty Ping Pong,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I was expecting Ping Pong balls but not Plactic Balls. I kept the balls since, i have opened one package. It is very delicate also. Without knowing I have ordered 4 packs I should have ordered 1 pack only. Too late now.."
4,Pocket Sized and Organized,"Keep track of what you read, when you read it, and all of your thoughts on the text. I never go anywhere without this cute journal. It's not as in depth as I would have liked but all the same I'm satisfied. I'll definitely buy another when this one fills up."
4,"Simple, portable, great","I read all the reviews of various book journals, ordered 3 and kept this one. It is very portable and simple. The criticism that it's hard to find the special sections like ""Recommendations"" is valid -- I fixed this by adding my own little sticky post-it note tabs on the edges of pages I might want to be able to find. I find that I don't have a whole lot to say about each book so there's enough room on each page for my needs -- I just make a few notes, I'm not writing a review or complex analysis. If you need prompting questions or wish to write a lot about every book, this one is probably not for you."
4,A Nice Product,"This is a nice way to keep track of your reading. There are also pages scattered throughout this little journal to list your favorite authors, books you would like to read and story ideas of your own.I would have liked the actual page layout to be more user friendly. You can either write really big litters, using the lines as the designer seems to have intended., or you can split each line up and make it two lines.This is a small product, easily fitting into a book bag or purse."
5,What I Read,this little book is perfect for recording the books in your personal library (no matter what the size). great if you're into different series-you can list the ones you haven't read. I carry this whenever I go to booksores or used book sales. wonderful little companion!
2,Disappointing...,"The Seven-Year List left me wanting more -- and not in the good way. I thought the story of four high school friends who attend a seven-year high school reunion to see if they've reached their goals and sort out unfinished business would supply a story full of uninhibited passion. Instead, the plot is weak, the characters are one-dimensional and the sex scenes lack heat. The only part I found remotely sensual was the one in which Julia seduces a young musician during a photo shoot. I just couldn't get into this novel. To make matters worse, some of the scenes are degrading in ways that the author hadn't intended them to be. At least I don't think Ms. Zoe Le Verdier wanted her characters to come across as dumb, demeaning and superficial. This is the weakest Black Lace offering I've read thus far. Skip this book and read The Captivation by Natasha Rostova or Menage by Emma Holly instead."
2,unrealistic,"I was very disappointed with this book. Everyone in this book was very unrealistic. Everyone owned their own business with a BENZ or a Jag. And what's up with Angela & Vanessa having to wear fake wedding bands to keep men from approaching them. Who does that??? Also, the dialogue was weak. There were also negative comments about overweight and uneducated people (women especially). And I thought it was so tacky of him to plug his own book, Never Satisfied: How & Why Men Cheat. Maybe next time, Micheal...."
1,Please put a basic English book in your Amazon shopping cart,"I thought I stunk in English! I have not read the book, but I will read it soon so that I can know what NOT to do when I write my first book. I heard about all the spelling and grammatical errors, and I think that is a really sad that he cannot take time out of his busy schedule to get a refresher course in English. I was just reading the author's comments on the beginning of the page, and the few mistakes he made there, is just unacceptable for a published author. My little sister knows the difference between ""there"" and ""their"". He is too old and have too much money not to know the difference. Was Mr. Baisden born in 1963 or 1993? Come on, Michael, please represent black people better than that. We are not uneducated slaves anymore! P.S. I am still in school working on my English so that I can come across as being smart when I start writing."
1,Bad Grammar?,"Well, I gave the book one star (because it is the lowest) and I have not even read it. I was going through the reviews to see if I wanted to order. Comments were from one extreme to the next but when I read the comment about a few grammar errors I stopped there. No book, no matter who the author is, should be released and expect to get high ratings with grammar errors. The story line may be good to a lot of readers but we should not settle for poor grammar. If it was the publishers fault I hope the author has a new one. A book published with errors is an insult."
5,Men Version of Waiting to Exhale,"Men Cry in The Dark is hilarious! It is a book given from a male's point of view. Baisden created every main character in the book with a different issue. I would say it is the men's version of Waiting to Exhale. One had baby momma drama, one liked only young girls, one had not commited to one woman....After reading the book I found myself wanting to know more about them. I didn't want the book to end. Reading the book was more like looking at a movie instead of reading a book. Read it, you won't be disappointed."
1,One question: Why?,"Michael Baisden's ""work"" were referred to me. I was told I'd enjoy and laugh at his novel. I'm still waiting to laugh. Firstly, every one of his characters is a stereotype, none of them are developed, and the ""plot"" (thin as it was) was not even sitcom quality. Maybe the author should spend a little less time doing speaking engagements, and more time learning to write."
2,Less than stellar,"I was really expecting this book to be great! I was wrong. The title was gripping but the story itself was less than stellar. While the idea of the story was interesting, I felt the characters were under-developed. The only character that you really get any kind of feel for is Derrick, and you still don't get to know him all that well. You never have the opportunity to get to know the characters. You read about one facet of their lives, but that's it. I found the characters to be one-dmensional, the writing bland, and the story line predictable! Desite my view on the book, I applaud the author for his effort and his dedication to his dream!"
1,"The Author Is Cool, But This Book SUCKS!","Black Men Won't Read for Long If They Have To Read Junk Like This! Give me a break - What the heck is this crap anyway? Michael Baisden is as cool as they come (I've seen him on TV and heard him on the radio a bunch of times). But he should stick to TV. This book is beyond bad. Characters who bored me to death, story-lines as weak as kindergarten fruit punch and a cover that lacked imagination are among the BETTER things about this nonsense. No wonder it's self-publsihed, self-promoted and self-destructive. I wanted to self-destruct when I read it and still wonder what Baisden's point was. If flipping the script on sistah's is where it's at, ""he ain't even there."" Note to Mike - You're cool. Why don't you get a TV show or something? Leave the books to the writers and the promoting to guys like yourself. Ever thought about infomercials?"
2,Almost made me cry too,"When I bought and read this years ago, I expected something really DEEP. Baisden has very passionate opinions, and I hoped he would reveal them in this novel.""Men Cry in the Dark"" was sometimes funny and entertaining, but never DEEP and stimulating. Perhaps 'cry' was a metaphor for talk because these men did talk in the dark, but no meaningful tears were shed. I did not sense, wipe, or taste the drop of a tear from the men nor myself.This one almost made me cry tears of disappointment, but I still enjoyed his other novels."
1,Did he write this in the dark?,"My son read it and asked me to read it so we could reference it in a life-long discussion we have on male/female relationships. I purchased it, took it along with me on a vacation and couldn't get past the first few pages. I think Baisden was either lazy or unskilled when he wrote this book. I never made it to the ending, and it's doubtful I'll pick up the book again.Check out ""The Season of Beento Blackbird."" It's a more thoughtful and useful book about relationships."
2,Why do you Blacks write trash on each other?,"As a white male, I don't know much about the Black experience. Of the few books I have read that are written by Blacks, they all have this venemous hatred of self and each other. If I had wrote those things about Black women as were mentioned in this novel, I would have been labelled a racist. I wish Baisden and his Black audiences all the best. You all need God's help in writing, reading and living. By the way, I did get a refund for this book not due to the subject but the inability to follow it."
3,"Entertaining, but not too heavy, reading","I appreciate this book for what the author intended it to be: a bold and honest look at contemporary relationships from a distinctly male perspective.I have read and heard quite a few comments about how the male characters described the female characters in this book. If some people want to slam the author for describing skin color, hair, build, etc., other authors, such as McMillan and Campbell, should be called to task for the same thing.Ben's relationship with Nikki proved to be the most bizarre while Derrick's relationship with Angela the most disappointing. Keep of the work, Mr. Baisden... we benefit from having this perspective available in the literary world."
4,entertaing male perspective of relationships,"Michael Baisden did an excellent job of sharing a males perspective concerning the trials and tribulations of relationships; Men Cry in the Dark was entertaining,interesting,insightful, and filled with unexpected twists and turns. Angela, you go girl, your character is truly an inspiration on how to deal with those men who choose to do wrong by you. Lastly, thanks Mr. Baisden for avoiding a predictible ending."
4,Help me to Understand,"People in general don't need a college degree to be labled as educated. I know a lot of people with college degree's thats dum as hell. I was tired of hearing the characters in the book refer to woman, that didn't attend college as ""uneducated"". The old saying is ""Education is the key to Success, but I think a Education is very important but not the key to success"". (but helpful in some cases)Besides my obvious complaint, the book is great!!!"
4,A Sisters in Spirit Book Review,"I would like to applaud Michael Baisden's efforts in bringing us a true to life story. Overall the novel was a wonderful work. It definitely provided our group with a very provocative discussion regarding relationships today. Interracial dating, the ""Single Man Syndrome"", Older Men and Younger Women were all topics discussed in the novel. This title gave us a little insight into the issues men face today. However, I was very disappointed that the main character, fell into the ""All Men are Dogs"" category. This is definitely one of my favorites!"
5,This is Phenomenal!,"First of all, I need to make sure everyone knows that Mr. Baisden is a terrific writer. This book answered so many questions and made it easier for me to understand how men think and what they go through. I found myself underlining things and taking notes. This is educational in every way. Women have always been known to be emotional and I believe this book also helped me realize that men have emotions too. I also like the fact that a woman (Nikki) completely dogged out Ben. Women are dogs too!, men are not the only ones doing the barking! What she did was not hard to believe but it just proves that the ""emotional"" ones are also capable of being back-stabbing and manipulative individuals! Overall, this book is a wake up call. I feel honored to have read it. This is a masterpiece! Even though I wished Derrick's situation would have worked out for the better, it was a happy ending after all. You never know you have a good thing until it's gone! Awesome work!"
2,Too much pre-publication hype!,"I was rather disappointed in this book. I had heard so much and all I got was Dynasty/Knots Landing served a la ghetto! The author provided too much free advertising with constant brand names. The interracial thing was not written well. The author makes this bro out to be some kind of coward. And why was Angela in the wedding? A round house kick to the groin? What was that? And high fives played out years ago. Instead of buying another novel from this author, I will save my boredom for something else and just donate the money to the author for creative writing lessons."
2,Not recommended,"Like some others, I was told this was a must-read by a good friend of mine so I had the expectation of something at least halfway decent. I had already read the joke ""Never Satisfied"" so I should have known better than to waste my time. Michael Baisden is humorous and I can almost see where he tries to go but it's too bad he never gets there. Who told this man to keep trying? What's up with switching POV's over and over? If it was in any way consistent, it could have worked but that would have been too much to ask. If you want to kill time, read this book. If you want to kill brain cells try Baisden's ""Maintenance Man""."
5,Excellent Read,"Men Cry in The Dark is hilarious! It is a book given from a male's point of view. Baisden created every main character in the book with a different issue. I would say it is the men's version of Waiting to Exhale. One had baby momma drama, one liked only young girls, one had not commited to one woman....After reading the book I found myself wanting to know more about them. I didn't want the book to end. Reading the book was more like looking at a movie instead of reading a book. Read it, you won't be disappointed."
5,"EXCELLENT,EXCELLENT, AND VERY REAL!!!!","I READ THIS BOOK WHEN IT FIRST HIT THE BOOK SHELF. EACH CHARACTER HAD A DIFFERENT SCENERIO THAT KEPT ME SAYING ""DAMN"" THIS BOOK HAS CHARACTERS IN IT THAT DESCRIBE (IF NOT US-LADIES) SOMEONE WE KNOW! MOST BOOKS I'VE READ END IN A FAIRY-TALE WAY, NOT THIS ONE. THIS BOOK IS REAL!!! MICHAEL KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!"
5,An excellent read from beginning to end. READ IT NOW!!!!,"I loved it. It showed insight into many types of women and men. You will not want to put it down. You could see people you know in the characters and feel their point of views. The ending was terrific, and made you say aloud ""That's what I'm talking about."" It's real from beginning to end. I'll definitely pass it on and recommend it to everyone I encounter. Michael, THANK YOU for a excellent read. It was good meeting you in Durham, NC at the Know Bookstore."
3,over rated,"This book is very overated... I was recommended this book by a friend and I was into at first, but as I got further into I realized that there were too many subplots, and that things got solved too easily, at least in my opinion. It was not very believable, like the ease in which Angela befriended Vanessa, and Vanessa jus showing up in the club with Derrick? some things jus could have been written better, he needed to elaborate on some parts, even the sex scenes seemed to be forced in there.read only if its free!!!"
2,Dear Michael,"I actually read the reviews because I was THINKING about reading the book. I thought the 1-star ratings were the most entertaining, so I gave him 1-star for effort and 2-stars for completion, but the reviews made me wonder, who is this guy? With all the clues, particularly, the mention of the View. I thought to myself ""I THINK I know who people are talking about"". Sure enough, I researched and realized that I DID read his other book, ""why men cheat"". I also, saw the View interview. I just assumed the guy was joking! He was hilarious!! Really ticking everybody off! Are you telling me he's serious? If so, There's really just one word for him. IGNORANT!! He should do stand up. I think I'll pass on this book, not unless someone gives it to me. I can always use a good laugh. :-)"
2,"good idea, bad book","The language that this book was written in was so simplistic I felt like I was reading the writing of an amateur. The prose was neither interesting, flowing, or well thought. It was choppy and very nondescriptive. The book failed to go into detail in to the lives of the characters. It brushed over central themes for each character, but missed the little details that make prose seem more lifelike. This is a book that you can read in a very short period of time and not have to think about too much. It is all spelled out for you. IT was ok. That is the most credit I will give it."
2,Kind of Weak,"This wasn't the worst book I've read, but it was far from the best. Considering the author was a man writting about male characters, I was expecting more of a ""males point of view"" and not the typical stuff we always hear, I was very disappointed. The characters and over all story line was weak, predicatable and almost boring. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but it never did. Also, Mr. Baisden needs to find a new editor, there's no excuse for the typo's in this book. Better luck next time."
2,Two stars for effort,"Sorry I bought the book in hardcover. I wish I had just checked it out of the library. While the author's efforts at presenting the male side were good the book itself wasn't. The changes in point of view were confusing and his lack of research made the book far less credible. The author should consult others if he is not sure. No one does a roundhouse kick to the groin. That is not possible. Additionally people don't go to undergrad and major in law (it is pre-law) and then decide not to go to grad school to get their law degree. Law is a professional degree. Also, Angela's credibility was shot when she told Michael, I mean Derrick, that she bought this outfit for him. Everything else she did contradicted that. Not to mention the book was full of typos, unnecessary changes in point of view, grammatical errors, and misinformation. Mr. Baisden should take a creative writing course before he writes another novel and hire an editor before he prints more copies of this book."
1,I feel that the book gave a negative image of black women.,"This book made it seems as though Black women are still behind in many ways. My biggest gripe is due to the fact that if you did not have a degree you were seen as ignorant in the eyes of these men. Then you have ""Brothas"" discrimantaing on ""Sistahs"" because of something in the past. That is ridiculous. Some of the things that the character that dated the white girl let slide tripped me out. Black men know that they won't let a black women get away with these types of things, but it is alright for them to be done by a white woman. Also when they were in the Drug dealers house and they saw the room that contained the drugs don't you know that they would not have made it out of there. The book was a little too fake for me and I didn't like it at all and don't recommend it to anyone."
4,Good Read,"This was a good page turner. I liked it, but my sister loved it. You won't be disappointed nor will you regret spending the money."
3,Some parts were unbelievable,"I think the book was okay. It grabs you in the beginning, but it starts to lose you 1/3 of the way. We learn about 4 men and their girlfriends. The book is another ""Waiting to Exale"" just with four males and not four women."
4,Real Relationships,A truthful look at how men feel about women and how women act toward men. Most men should be able to relate to one of the 4 primary male characters. If not there is always the other men in the book.
4,Boys Will be Boyss,"I can not write this review without giving kudos for the cover. It generated much conversation, to the point where I couldn't read while commuting because people (espcially men) wanted to know what it was about.Michael Baisden definitely has his own way of writing a novel. I like how he tells it like it is without trying to sugar coat anything that men do.I like books by men about men. While this is a work of fiction and the characters have been called stereotypical, but I know people like this, especially Mark.I liked the friendship of the guys (Mark, Tony, Derrick, and Ben). The tests of their friendships is very true to life. We will never please everybody. Okay, I have certain fundamental problems with the characters, but that's just me being a woman and thinking that the logic of men is strange (at least some of their logic). I had to remind myself that this is a novel-not real life. This book was thoroughly entertaining. It's an easy read and it provides good laughs."
1,Why did he write this?,"My book club read this book. No one liked it. It was full of cliche and name/designer dropping. There were also a number of grammatical errors. We thought maybe the author was stuck on himself and was trying to mirror the book after his imaginary life. Mr. Baisden, good effort but, don't quit your day job."
2,Two stars for effort.,"I kept an open mind while reading but to no avail. Aside from very poor story development, I was appalled at the many, major errors (first person, grammar, etc). Baisden said this book is self-published. Every author I've known who self-published was very sure to utilize a professional proofreader/editor prior to sending the manuscript to press. By not doing so, Baisden has demonstrated to me that he is lazy, greedy, insincere, and disrespectful to his readers by publishing a faulty product.Also, the author needs to do his homework and research the subject(s) he is trying to write about. It is very obvious that he is writing from his imagination about affluence. Baisden has a credibility problem and I would never call him a real ""writer.""I guess I heard to much publicity about his book. Then I read it. I guess this type of writing is great for the young, hip-hop, gangsta rap, inner city adolescent. Escapism. I wish the author and his audiences well."
3,Easy Read,It's like an all male Waiting to Exhale... Wonderful book. I especially love the ending. All I'll say is that it's not your usual storybook ending.
4,I enjoyed this book,Was good reading I would have liked to have had a different ending for each of the men (wanted to see how their lives progressed after the decisions they made )
2,Just okay...,"The book and the story line was kind of predictable - except for the end. His effort to try to develop the stories behind the characters was just too detailed for me. I was halfway through the book and he was still laying the foundation for things and it just wasn't keeping my interest. Overall, I think it was a sleeper. Sorry Mike."
1,Boring....,Boring with no direction. Kind of confusing at times.. Will not recommend this to anyone.
4,This is an awesome depiction of the power of friendship.,"I truly enjoyed Mr. Baisden's storyline in Men Cry in the Dark. This is truly a moving story with great insight into the struggles for survival, love and friendship that face our black men today. I encourage anyone who wants to know the energy it takes to go after your dreams to read this book."
1,Shallow & Pathetic,"This was bad it was reccomended to me for my bookclub and we unanimously agreed it was by far one of worst books we've read. 1. The story remains around the arrogant character Derrick whom has a profile like Michael Basiden...that didn't take much imagination. Basiden never really develops the other characters like Mark and Ben and when did these men really cry? Please let me not forget the most unromantic oral sex scene I've ever heard of...Basiden must not have an appreciation for true oral love...only someone who didn't know what they were doing would wash it. Last who would dare compare Basiden to Terry McMillan...Terry is a storyteller...Basiden is just out to make some money off his Playa experience. If you want to read some good black male authors Read E.Lynn, Colin Channer, Franklin White and many more."
3,This book is okay.,"I am an African American female. Read this book and it's okay. Not all that great nor all that bad to get the extremely nasty AND the extremely positive reviews. Nothing new or uplifting learned out of Baisden's fiction and non-fiction books. As for him being a ""relationship expert,"" I don't think so, based on his comments and performances at his book signings, talk show appearances and radio discussions. This book was light entertainment with no literary or cultural contributions. By the way, I liked Baisden's fiction novel much better than Terri McMillan's novel and movie (Waiting to Exhale). Although she is a far better writer than Baisden, I hate the victimology themes present in all of her works."
1,Disappointment,"I went to five different Barnes and Noble's to acquire this book, and when I was unable to acquire it right away I thought it really has to be hot. This book was selected by my book club. I was totally disppointed in reading Men Cry In the Dark, I felt that the characters in the books was to materialistic. It was easy reading but not at all what I expected. I would not recommend this book to another club."
3,IT WAS OK,"Although I felt the ending is kind of plain, the book is not as bad as the reveiws. Unlike Waiting To Exhale, I felt no sympathy for these men. The only character that I felt evolved is Benjamin. I feel that I have gained a little knowledge about ""affluent"" Black men. The book is not a page turner for me and I do not feel all men act the same way the idiotic characters are in this book.I know people with more money then these guys and none of them act like these characters.I hope the author figures out its not about how much money you have in the bank, its about how much love you have in your heart. If you are looking for a quick read without too much thought this may be the book for you but ladies, make sure you have $1000 in the bank and single with no children or you might get offended."
4,Book was good character change needed but good.,"book was intersting but need to relate more to the average black person, not one of the main characters worked at Nation's Bank or was a full-time student."
3,ENJOYED IT,Thought the book was quite insightful and provided a new outlook on dating and relationships from our prospective. There is room for improvement but there isn't that the same for all that are aspiring for greatness as writers. I admire this effort and look forward to the next one.
5,I Really Enjoyed This Book!!,Due to some of the negative reviews I read here about this book I was apprehensive about reading it. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this book gave a very real portrayal of relationships from the male point of view. I personally liked the way it ended because I thought it was realistic. I would have done the same thing that Angela did. The best thing I liked about this book was that Angela was a Delta!! You go Michael!!
3,Maybe next time,"This was the first book I've read from Michael and it was good but not what I expected. I've heard so much about this man, heard him on the radio, even seen him on Montell. Don't get me wrong I liked the book but....It just did'nt grab me. I like his style of writting so I brought another novel of his The Maintenance Man and I hope I like this one better."
1,Can I Give It Half A Star?,"I selected this book for my book club and I have to say, I am ashamed. I chose this book because it was suppose to be a ""unique"" viewpoint. The storyline was weak, the characters were underdeveloped and the book reeked of materialism. What was the point? I hope his next book is better developed. I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."
1,"Maybe your old job in Chicago will re-hire you, Mike!","We all read this novel for our women's bookclub. By the time we met for a critique, we were divided three ways: the few who liked the book, others who were angered and insulted, the rest were like me -- laughing so hard at the author's incompetence.We took turns finding inconsistencies, mispellings, racist remarks, bad syntax, missing punctuations. We were on the floor laughing by the time we realized that all this novel achieved was free advertising to all the brand names which were mentioned as a front to cover the author's ignorance on the subject of the lifestyles of the rich and famous.Even though I am not crazy about anything Terri McMillan writes, it is obvious she didn't play hooky from English class, like Baisden apparently did.Men Cry in the Dark? Well, Baisden, we women cried from laughter at your arrogance which was only superceded by your incompetence expressed in print for the world to see."
2,Expected more....was disappointed.,"Book dwelled too much on description of skin color, cars, clothing, etc. Should have worked harder on developing the characters. Although this was fiction, he could have made the characters more believable; only one that appeared real was ""Ben"". Maybe its just me, but I don't know too many young ""Blacks"" that have so much going for them at such a young age. Also, why did we need to know about Angela putting on her "" rolex watch, diamond necklace, and boucheron perfum? Why all the put down on fat people and ""brothers that were unattractive""? Maybe in time Mr. Basiden will become a great writer; its obvious now that all he is doing is trying to make a ""buck"". I guess there is nothing wrong with that, as long as you don't put others down in the process."
1,10 minutes I will never get back!,"At least I didn't have to pay for this text - a pathetic and appalling literary attempt. Michael Baisden, himself, gave me a copy of ""Men Cry in the Dark"" as well as two of his other books after meeting me at a workshop in L.A. His attempt to impress me fell far short of my expectations. The problem with Michael is that he really thinks he's a good writer but he just doesn't have a clue. Suffice it to say I got through 10 minutes of the book and I couldn't bare it anymore... Uninteresting characters, a boring plot, trite sterotypes, and glaring grammatical errors. I could go on and on. Aside from the fact that he's a dreadful writer, anyone that knows Michael also knows that he is extremely cocky as well as very sexist. For someone with such subpar talent to be so arrogant really puts the nail in the coffin for me. Save your time and your money and read the work of some real literary geniuses like E. Lynn Harris or Eric Jerome Dickey."
2,i was shocked,no only were there mistakes but i didnt like how he refered to young single mothers in the book we are not all uneducated loud and gold diggers maybe he should do more research before he calls himself an expert on women
3,Gilligan's Island,I purchased this game because it is fun. I didn't remember that it is not intuitive. You need the directions to figure it out or a lot of time on your hands than I have.
4,buy 2,"The Ultra dermabrasion kit from Igia is a must have, for facial needs. Obvious, improvement,when used regularly -in skin tone and smoothness,2 speeds that are perfect. ,sturdy,batteries last quite awhile. My daughter came over once a week for a facial, I am getting her one as a gift.why 4 and not 5 stars-?another brush attachment would have made it perfect"
3,Still is Ferry Corsten,3 Stars....because....is too much....I dont know...HOUSIE CHESSIE...and little bit TRANCIE COMMERCIAL. Anyway for Ferry fans and for the collection it is an ADD.
4,satisfied so far ...,Very fast shipping and the item looks good. I haven't use it yet but I can tell it is a good one. I will update after I use it.
4,Does the Job.,"Almost with everything included. The tester kit is made of very good quality materials and price is also good. Is made for cars that has a schrader valve test port. Cars that do not have it, get you in the inconvenience of forcing you to create an adaptation that cost you some extra money and specially, time. It would be convinience if the kit comes with everything you might need.The kit does the Job perfectly well."
5,Excellent choice,This product does exactly what it is supposed to do and is priced to not break the bank. Used it to diagnose a slight miss with my Blazer. Was able to determine that I had a leaky fuel injector that was causing the miss. The miss was only obvious at idle and not much at all. Still it was enough to set the check engine light. Checked my fuel pressure with the gauge and was able to determine it was bleeding off pressure faster than it was supposed to. Gauge also comes with an adapter for Ford as well. Good to know if I ever have a Ford in the driveway.
2,Designed for one time use only,"Bought this overseas-made tester to troubleshoot a fuel problem with my 1996 Impala SS. The gage fits fine, though you will need pliers to tighten it enough to stop leaks. The drain valve is a handy feature, but the clear fuel line will harden after the first use, making it aggravating to use. The schrader valve connection has a rubber gasket inside that will deteriorate after a couple uses, causing the connection to leak and make the gage useless. This is a proprietary rubber seal, and local auto parts will not carry parts for these cheap gages. I have tried an o ring without success. Recommend investing in a better quality gage unless you plan to use it once and throw it away."
3,Good but could use a slight improvement,"I purchased this tested to test the fuel pressure on a 98 Dodge Neon. The manual is not up to date on the vehicle models it fits but it does fit my car. The unit is inexpensive, and performs as stated. The drain line is useful in bleeding the fuel system pressure, especially when you're done testing and want to remove the gauge.One thing I would have preferred is better knurling of the screw on coupling. Although there is some knurling, the coupling sleeve is still quite slippery and you can't get a liquid tight seal unless you tighten it down with a pair of pliers. The second thing is as other have mentioned, if they would supply a pouch to keep the drain line from spewing all over my drawer and getting tangled with other things.Overall, I am happy with it's performance. It's not a tool I use everyday and I'm happy to own one for this price. It helped me diagnose my fuel pump problem."
4,gas pressure guage,Very nice product. 20 bucks cheeper than Sears.Would be nice if it came with a case or pouch to hold it.
2,Worked great twice,"Used this tester twice. Tried to use it three times. It worked great the two times that it did work but the third time I tried to use it, the needle valve came apart and the needle feel out of the fitting. Still haven't replace the fitting yet. Great tool, just cheap quality."
4,Cool for 4 devices,its cool for 4 devices its not to hard to use and you need to make sure you program it to the right things
4,"A Monument to the End of Time, Alchemy, Fulcanelli and the Cross at Hendaye","Interested in the Mayan Calender and the ""End of Time 2012"" prediction I wanted to know how this prediction was capable of being made in South America and North Africa / Middle East at around the same time.The authors answered these questions as well as providing an array of new literature and questions for me to follow up on.Truly a great read for the querist."
5,If you love Roy Orbison . . . .,". . . you're gonna love this disc. Simple as that. Many of these songs are as good as his better known Monument recordings, full of that same melodramatic sense of desperation and of course that unique voice . . . . It is a shame that his MGM era is so neglected (it produced no top ten hits, the biggest hit peaked at only #25) because the quality is stellar."
2,Classic Orbison...NOT!,"All I can say is...there is a REASON Roy's MGM material never stays in print for any length of time. It makes his Sun output look stellar! This is a classic case of an amazing artist who made it big with a small label and then got lured away by a big label with more cash and the promise of a movie. And in the process lost his artistic bearings and soul. Very few of these songs even scraped into the Top 40 and for good reason: They are lame and a shocking mockery of what he had done at Monument. Roy lost his ability to write or pick songs, his movie was a stinker, personal tragedy after personal tragedy struck and it was a fast nose-dive from the top of the pop world to doing oldies package tours. All these songs just seem to have a ""I am phoning this in and doing it for the money"" feel to them. This is far from classic material and I can only recommend this for hardcore Orbison fans or the curious."
3,It's Only For Collectors,"This cd only has one song that may be hard to find, ""My lovely man"" live. The enhanced video is of pretty bad quality. Only for collectors."
5,saladgirl,"All of Patsy Clines' best. Purchased after I saw ""Love, Patsy"" and I couldn't find my old Patsy CD. Excellent collection, what a voice!"
2,Coverking vinyl front seat covers,"The seat backs fit very nicely and stay in place very well. The same cannot be said for the seat bottoms. They bunch up and just don't seem to fit, and when you shift around or turn to step out of a tall 4x4, the whole seat bottom cover turns with you because the vinyl is very tacky. Another problem is that these covers are not breathable at all. The center console cover does not stay in place very well, and prevents the cover from latching. On the positive side, the color matches very well to Ford light grey, and the stiching detail looks like factory original to me, though I haven't looked at Ford's leather seats to compare."
3,Dated but entertaining,"This collection of stories is worthwhile for anyone interested in the early years of pulp science fiction. The stories are often predictable, especially the section on ""suburbia"" (I loaned the book so do not have it handy to double check the section name), and the style, character traits, language, social mores are all very dated. The nods at future technology are the barest of nods. Despite all that the stories in the first two sections were fun, well written, and entertaining."
4,Electric Prunes - 'Lost Dreams' (Birdman),"Beside the hard-to-find UK import 'Long Day's Flight',this collection of 23 songs on 'Lost Dreams' is the only legit Prunes compilation release.Includes mostly cuts from their first two albums 'I Had Too Much To Dream' and 'Underground' plus some super-rare singles and previously unreleased demos(those are always good to hear).Since I've always dug these guys,It's tough for me not to fully appreciate tracks like their lesser known tunes such as ""Luvin'"",""Try Me On For Size"",""Wind-Up Toys"" and ""Ain't It Fun"".Strictly for the Electric Prunes completists OR a new fan that just prefers to get JUST one of their CD's.A should-have."
4,Almost definitive,"This compilation renders all other Electric Prunes releases obsolete. James Lowe, lead singer, intended this. Unhappy with all the other Prunes releases, Lowe and bassist Mark Tulin selected tracks they deemed worthy of the Prunes legacy and remastered them specifically for this release. Consequently, this is the best Punes album you'll be able to get your hands on. One minor quibble: where is ""Children Of Rain"" and ""Antique Doll""? However, the remastering makes up for this minor omission. The sound is simply amazing. You can put away the first two albums for good now."
3,Zyxel can do better than this.,"I bought 2 of these units hoping for better connectivity. I got it...kind of. I had to place the unit in a more open area. No big deal, but not what I had planned. Also, the install can be fussy. The Zyxel software crashed during install and after a few tries I gave up on the software and just used the windows wireless management tool. It works and through put is pretty good. Not a perfect solution if you ask me."
1,This is a piece of junk,"Wish I could give it 0 stars. I got it in mid-June and was really excited that I'd get MIMO performance with my Zyxel X-550 router. As soon as I installed it, my PC started locking up (XP SP2). Looked for new drivers and/or firmware on the Zyxel website, but NO. There's a link to what it SAYS is a driver, but the 13MB download is a copy of the installation CD WITHOUT the driver at all. Sent an email to Zyxel and have gotten no reply at all. This thing is nothing but a POS."
1,Mouse attractant?,"Tried this, but ended up with even more mice. This did nothing to alleviate the problem and was a waste of money."
5,The Iliad,"I thought this book was going to be kind of a boring history but is really good and interesting,it is about the trojan war and the greek Gods and Godness. I definitely recommend this book to who ever is into the greeks and enjoy some of the poetry that the writer use to express the dialogue in between the personalities, is really good!!!"
4,I enjoyed the movie,I love to watch Bible and end times movies so I enjoy watching most of them. I believe that this one makes for a good witnessing tool.
5,"Personally, I LOVED IT!!!!","I really enjoyed this book!! I didn't really like Gwen, but over all the story was amazing!! The way she tied the father in through disguises was interesting. One question I had when I finished the book that was never answered, was- what happened to Langston? After he brings Mary her letter from her brother Thursday October,(which was funny in itself!) he goes back to Cambridge. But they never say what happens to him, and if he ever got his question from the beginning anwered. One thing I did like was that the author didn't make Mary and Langstons' relationship go too far. :) *****"
3,One is a 2 star the other a 5 star and the dvd's a 2 so we get a 3,"First of all the cover of the dvd, (at least mine) does not look this cool. It is a cheezy cheap cover with a still from each film inside a film strip design. Secondly, Gran Casino is more than likely a studio project accepted by a hungry Bunuel. It's a musical (which none of the reviews above mention). Unlike many musicals the music doesn't really forward the storyline and is just kind of a showcase for the artists perfroming the music. If the film didn't have this it would showcase the suprisingly intresting storyline it has. Albeit it's better the music doesn't forward the story because they didn't subtitle the songs. The best part of the dvd is The Young One, one of two Bunuel films in english (above they said only one but he also directed Robinson Crusoe). A riveting story, beautifully shot and edited, 5 stars hands down. Best part of this dvd set and worth every penny."
