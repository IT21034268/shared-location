5,Tugs @ those heart strings!!,"This is a ""MUST"" see Movie!! It's one of those movies you watch and realize this is another terrible thing that the African American Women went through way before my time. You read about it in School, but until you either see it with your own eyes, or have the misfortune of living through it, then you get an awesome cast together, with an awesome director to get this Incredible book to come to life on screen!! THEN, BAM!!! You've another, ""5 *****"" Must see Movie that I want to shout out,""This is one for your Movie Library!! Thanks, Robin C./ Athens, GA"
4,Good movie,"I thought the first half of the movie was a bit slow and thought to myself that it needed to ""get to the point"" a bit sooner. I liked this movie for the antics the women did. I like how the director showed what it was like for a black person during the segregation era. I understand that it was one woman's point of view, but unless everyone lived everyone else's lives, you couldn't REALLY know what it was like back then as each individual has their own feelings on the situation. That being said, I enjoyed all the 'comedy' of the movie and thought the story was well written. It was nice to see that 'revenge' on the poor behavior of the white women that were not only abusive to the black maids but other white women. I was able to 'connect' with all the women and it helped me to sympathies with black people of that time period. And now want to read the book!"
5,great movie,"very different movie, cool idea, I liked how it wasn't what I was expecing. i would rccomend this to a friend. Not super exiting, but very well written, relaxing"
5,AWESOME MOVIE,Great movie! Very touching and lots of Southern humor! I will be watching this movie over and over again! A must see!
5,An excellent representation of part of our ugly past.,"Having grown up in this era, I found this film, as well as the book, to fairly depict the horrible conditions that people of color had to endure in order to survive. It also illustrates how ""people of privilege"" really had no clue as to the emotional damage they meted out on a regular basis. Trusting enough to have their children's rearing entrusted to someone whom they didn't trust to use their in-house bathroom facilities. Very poignant."
4,Movie to watch,I love this movie and loved the book as well. Have watched it several time and see new things each time.
5,Thanks for the Help,I actually ordered this DVD for a friend's Christmas gift and was delighted to have received it in plenty of time. My friend really wanted this and was thrilled. I must borrow it since I have not seen it! The price was very good & I do thank Amazon once again.
5,Best movie I have ever seen,"I am a ""read the book first"" person, and I am often dissappointed at the movie,but not in this case-have seen this movie 3 times, and will buy it as soon as it is available. The characters are great, the story is positive-With respect to the other review I read about being confused if the book wasn't read, I do not agree-enjoyable either way, and great for all the things I like in a movie-good story, the ""good guys"" win (Abilene, Minnie and Skeeter), the folks who aren't so good get theirs, too-fairly faithful to the book, something I also don't see often in adaptations to film-"
3,The Help - Blu Ray disc won't play,Purchased this through Amazon as a Christmas present and couldn't get the Blu Ray disk to play on an Oppo BPD83 player. Just purchased WINDVD11 as a player for my Lenovo A700 and the disc wouldn't play on the PC either. So much for building a Blu Ray collection when I can't get the first BD disc I've purchased to play. Will have to wait for it to come out on Laserdisc....still have my old CLD97. SD
3,The Help needs help,"It was disappointing to pay rental on a movie with no closed caption. The movie itself was quite good, but for people who need CC, it was unhandy having to back up and replay."
2,Pure Hollywood,Did a perky white woman ever give Rosa Parks the strength to stay in her seat?The cardboard baddie and her drones are unrealistic.I liked the performance of the two maids which leads me to wonder why they weren't the protagonists.Chick flick reminiscent of Fried Green Tomatos but in no way measures up.(This review reflects my opinion of the movie only and not the book which I haven't read.)
3,A bit over rated.....,"This was a GOOD movie but not GREAT a bit over rated, with pretty good performances with Octavia being the standout in my opinion this movie is worth your time however a second viewing is probably not necessary. I will always tell it like I see it. Scott M"
2,It was terrible,This movie made wanted me to dip my head in a bucket of acid and my head was throbbing like a lemon being crushed with a monster truck being run over a 17 million directions ugh it was god awful
2,Not necessary,"I know that my opinion may not be politically correct, but i get very offended when movies use God's name as a swear word. I have watched many movies over the years that could have used God's name like that but did not and i never missed it. It is not like someone is going to down rate a movie because they did not use God's name as a swear word. ""Oh you know that movie was OK but it should have used God's name as a swear word, I guess I am going to have to give it 3 stars instead of 5."" That scenario does not seem likely. It may not seem like a big deal but when they stand before the God they cursed (and they will) it will be a big deal."
4,A movie that exposes barriers,"I thought the acting was excellant & content of movie was great, considering they couldn't film the whole book. The subject of domestics in America has long been & still is overlooked.The only thing I would take back is I would have seen the movie first, & read the book after."
3,The Help Needed a Little Help,"This is a good movie but the book is so much better. I caught several discrepancies.If you have read the book, don't bother."
5,The Help,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time! I have watched it twice and shared it with friends. It will be one of my keepers.
5,Perfect laugh to tear ratio,"This is a brilliant film adaptation of an excellent book. The Help realistically protrays the white women of Jackson, Mississippi in the 1960s and the ways they treated their colored help. Although I had already the book, the film portrayal of discrimination was so shocking at times that I almost felt embarrassed to be watching it, shamed of our country's history. Yet, the movie offers an optimistic hope about the true goodness of most people and the ways in which wrongs are often eventually righted.The movie is both funny, moving, well-written, and beautifully acted. This is the best movie I have seen in a long time, and unlike most of my other reviews, this movie does actually deserve an Oscar."
5,Great Movie,This was a very amusing and interesting story which showed a lot of truth about the time in life. A very inspiring movie.
5,FUNNY FUNNY MOVIE,This movie is so FUNNY. I saw it at our theater & knew I would buy it when it came out on DVD.
4,A great story,"None of what I kept fearing would show actually did--in this type of film, the filmmakers so often throw in melodrama and unbelievable scenes just to manipulate the viewers' emotions. For example, I kept fearing that a horrible reprisal was in store for us after the book was published, one that would stretch the limits of believability. It never did, and that's a good thing.This is a very well-told story that is extremely well acted with often subtle performances that convey a beautiful story of risk, cooperation, hope, and compassion. My only reason for not giving it five stars, though, is the editing--there are some scenes that drag, and they go slow for really no obvious reason. This film easily could have been 20 minutes shorter with no loss. It just doesn't feel tight. And while that's certainly not a fatal flaw--I still loved the movie--it is something that detracts from the overall experience."
3,Glad I read the book first,"I had heard a lot of hype about the book and then movie. I finally got around to reading the book and completely loved it. Well written, fantastic character development- hard to put down book. Once finished with the book, I watched the movie. Not a bad movie overall but, very lacking in character development and I do not think that it shows the bond between the women writing the book. I feel that had I not read the book first, the movie would have been lacking as far as my feeling for and with the characters. That said, the acting was wonderful and I did enjoy putting faces to the characters. Somewhat entertaining, yes. If you are considering seeing the movie do yourself and read the book first!"
3,Doesn't Hold a Candle To The Book,"I loved the book. Loved, loved, loved it. That is why I was so excited to see the movie. I wanted to love the movie just as much. I was pretty disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I thought the actors were fabulous, the sets were gorgeous and it was shot very well. What I didn't like is how much they left out from the book. The characters in the movie were far too simplistic and they left so many stories out about the characters. There were also a lot of very funny lines left out that I thought for sure would be in the movie because they were so original. I realize that no movie can truly compare to the book, but I think the movie producers could have done better. I was disappointed by the lack of depth. Maybe if I hadn't read the book first, I would have liked the movie much more."
5,Gift Item,"This was purchased as a gift and since I had seen the movie, thought it would make a good gift."
5,For my mom,I bought this for my mom and she loved it. She said it was a great book. The movie was good too.
5,enjoyed,good movie. It was nice to be able to just download it and watch on the laptop. We have a smart tv too that we could have watched it on also. I have actually seen this movie twice.
4,Good Movie,I don't want to say a comment. Why can't I just assess using the stars? You should change this requirement.
3,Good movie,"I liked this movie, but I thought it was way over-hyped. Definitely not as great as all the fuss was about. Still trying to figure out what the fuss was about..."
4,How the south really was,"This picture also deserves its rewards. For those of you not old enough to remember the OLD SOUTH...believe me, there is much that is OH! SO TRUE!"
5,Great1,"Saw part of the movie for the first time the other day on Showtime or something. Bought the DVD so I could watch it through again. Awesome movie. One of the best of the past decade. Serious and comical, recommend it to everyone."
5,The Help,"I thought that this movie was very interesting, and was surprisingly true to the novel. Purchasing the HD version provided excellent quality."
2,Racial story,"Simple, I don't like films that deal with race.I am a white woman who was raised by a black nanny whom I loved dearly. I don't want to see this type of film because it upsets me."
1,movie stuck,this movie would be a good movie if we could actually watch it all the way thur it freezes in several parts of movie we cleaned it and still didnt help wont trust seller again
2,Simplistic and shallow,"This movie was so silly and contrived. How many people have toilets just sitting around to donate?? Come on! Like the Blind Side, just another simplistic ""feel good"" movie with no substance."
3,HollywoodLand,"The movie was entertaining and true to the book. Like any adaptation, it did not get into the emotional backstory as much but it was still sufficient for the viewer to follow along."
3,Great Movie - Poor Shipping,"This was difficult to give a ""star"" rating for because the movie is fantastic! However, the movie came in the mail and the case was severally damaged. It was shattered in several places."
5,Great video,"If you read the book and even if you didn't, this movie is wonderful. Lots of entertainment and a wake up call for things that need changed in our country. Makes you think."
5,The help,"The help exceeds all expectations, not only is it a joy to watch but it also has one of the best story lines I've seen in a movie for years!"
1,Help Blu ray,The blue ray didn't work dvd did will have to return this product also was late getting this product did a pre order but didn't get it in time period was told.
1,Unbelievable....From a black mans point of view.,"As far as Im concerned,this is complete and utter trash!We all know the story,and this aint the way it happened.Stop taking us back with corny movies,that are degrading to blacks.The cover alone is disgusting.No matter how far we get,there's always something trying to take us back to those days.Here's a secret....YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THOSE DAYS AGAIN.So try re-writing another part of history to show yourselves in a different light.That ones been written.LEAVE IT ALONE."
5,Outstanding Movie,The Help is a movie that totally surprised me. My wife wanted to see it but it did not sound like something I would enjoy. Boy was I wrong. We both enjoyed it far more than I thought we would. Maybe it has something to do with the time period of the movie. I was there and saw the things the movie was about. It has significant historical value.
5,The Help needs bo help,Product arrived before expected and the service and quality of the vendor was excellent. Everything promised exceeded expectations and I'll definitely use again when I order.
4,Full Refund Appreciated,"I was able to get a full refund promptly from the seller of this printer. It was an incomplete order, an honest mistake. I bought another printer in the interim, so did not need to keep the one I had ordered. I appreciate the great service! Thank you!"
5,Great movie!,"It was a great movie, but part of it was kinda depressing to realize people in the 1960's were STILL so prejudiced!"
3,The Help,"Movie was documentary based on facts. Was brilliantly made, great cast. However, came up short on drama and excitement."
5,The Help,Absolutely wonderful. I have watched it three times and have cried at the ending three times. I have given it as gifts. Wow!!
4,Viola & Octavia give real performances,"People complained about yet another movie with Black characters as servants and a too good to be true White saviour. This isn't that movie. Its about the maids and the women who give them life in this film truly give them life. Yes, the novel is a piece of fiction, but the feelings of these women felt true to me as a film watcher and the granddaughter of a Mississippi maid. I liked it. I didn't love it, but I did really enjoy the help and the performances are worthy of the awards they are receiving."
2,Book so much better...,I was very disappointed with the movie. Some of the more controversial things that were covered in the book were not even touched in the movie. Which made what was being done less remarkable. I think the book should be read by everyone.
2,disappointingly average,"After being disappointed in the book I had some hope that all the glowing reviews of the film might be deserved. Unfortunately the movie was a typical formula Hollywood studio piece with, despite the good cast, barely adequate acting, corny predictable humor, southern stereotypes, average direction, average screenplay, etc,etc. Except for Viola Davis. Bless her heart, she did her best to carry this movie and give it some heft, which the wonderful story obviously deserved, but it was all pretty much a silly mess. I kept feeling Viola had wandered into the wrong movie, a shame."
2,Unreal,"Was looking forward to seeing this with my wife and daughter. Went to sleep pretty quick. Unrealistic characters and story. All of the white people were one dimensional cartoon characters. Kind of reminds me of a not very good high school play. Growing up in the south, there were some people like this, but not the majority. Dont waste your time watching this."
2,Rent Before Buying This Movie,"It just wasn't what the commercials promised it to be. ""It will make you laugh and cry"". I really was looking forward to this movie. I couldn't wait for it to be over with. 2 hrs. 26 mins.is way too long. I found it insulting in many ways. I was disappointed. I'm glad I rented it at Redbox."
5,Good movie,"This movie reminded me of the movie ""Fried Green Tomatoes"". I recommend it highly, especially if you saw and liked Fried Green Tomatoes."
4,"Touching, Sweet Movie with a Little Something to Say About Race","I'm not a big fan of message movies or of movies that preach too loudly into my ear. This movie certainly had its messages, but it never felt preachy, it never got to the point where a drama becomes self-indulgent melodrama. Instead, a good dose of humor and exceptional supporting performances kept the messages human and honest.I have to note that aside from the racial and human issues raised, car buffs will enjoy the big old American iron. Not particularly important to the soul of the story, I couldn't help but sit and enjoy the view now and again.Highly recommended."
3,The Help needs some help.,The movie had it's funny moments but it was not what I was hoping for. The plot was shallow and ends leaving you wondering if you missed something. Ok movie is about all I can say about it.
5,The HELP needs no Help at telling its story!,Great movie and characters.........but you didnt need my review to tell this Oscar winner's fate did you. Got a good price and time. Nicely done Amazon and ROKU!
4,Help,I saw the movie before I read the book. I hoped that the book would give me more insight and it did. Enjoyable but a little slow in some places.
4,"Great movie, but too many pauses and reloads","Movie has a great story. Would recommend it to others. My viewing experience was very poor, however. The movie kept stopping and starting, so it was very distracting. When it would reload, the picture was blurry for a while making it frustrating to watch. But the movie itself was great."
5,Words Can Not Describe How Good This Is!,"I was waiting to read the book but I was surprised when my partner ordered this movie for me! This movie will definitely make you laugh and cry. It is well written, I was skeptical at first but thank goodness I was wrong. The way they did the scenery, gave each character depth, made it comical AND dramatic...is beyond words. This is one movie that made me want to read the book even more! Beautiful."
5,The Help movie,I read the book and was eager to watch the movie. The book was much better; the one thing that I noticed right away was that her mothers disease was known from the beginning whereas in the book it took a while to come out.Awesome movie though. I forgot the ending and started to cry again...
2,"Received quickly, but not new as ordered.","I received order quickly, but when we played the disc, it was flawed both audio and visual near the half of the movie. It last about 3 to 4 minutes, then continued with no other problems. I was disappointed because I ordered a new disc."
3,Can't touch book,"I so enjoyed the book I really looked forward to the movie. The actresses they had picked did not match the descriptions in the book. Their are plenty actresses out there who are tall and plain, they should have been more thoughtful so the story made sense."
3,OK,the help was good but slow running for me. the movie requires my re watching it again and who knows!
5,Funny and down to earth,Enjoyed this film. Its a must see! Nothing like a movie that can make you laugh so hard you cry!
1,Bad trumpet,"I bought this trumpet for my marching band. It is terrible. The valves are impossible to deal with. They have to be oiled every 15 minutes in order for them to even move properly. The alignment between the valves and the valve containers is off and when you look at the valve from the mouthpiece view (while playing) you can tell the valve keys are at a 80 ish degree angle with the hole of the valve. They are not straight and will not go in properly sometimes. Do not buy this trumpet, your money is better spent on another."
5,Functional product at a reasonable price delivered fast,I am glad with my purchase. The deliver was fast and the product completely functional.
5,Kick Butt Super Robot War,"This is yet another take on the Mazinger Z character. The DVD is non stop action, LITERALLY! The show opens and WHAM ,action packed! The Heavy Metal influence and extreme robot on monster violence means little kids should stay away from this one. My only complaint is the movie is a little short but if you like Mazinger and super robots from Japan you will love this one."
2,Low Quality Books,"I like the content, but the quality of material used is very poor. Definitely will not recommend for children under one due to poor quality of paper used."
4,my daughter loves it!,"my 3 year old daughter loves it! she gets to pick a book from the box and we go through it one by one. if i need to do something around the house i ask her to build the tallest tower and it keeps her busy for at least half an hour!very good value for money, i highly recommend it!"
4,Going to pieces peacefully....,"A Buddhist psychologist recommended this book to me and I am glad they did. It not only presents a readable and enjoyable introduction to some mindfulness concepts, but also a good way to start to appreciate relevant Buddhist concepts. It is written in an accessible way and a must for anyone who sees the journey as more important than the destination...."
3,Three stars only because,"I'm not a Buddhist and a lot of the material didn't mean much.With that said, the book contains a good bit of practical advice and stories that help explain the author's viewpoint and his experiences to us laypeople.I'm sharing this book with friends and they tell me they've enjoyed the exposure.Enjoy!"
4,Digging it,"I'm currently reading this book, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. It's helping me to take a more play-oriented approach to my writing."
5,Read in case of emotional EMERGENCY,"I've given this book over and over again to people I learn are in great stress, or who are experiencing the kind of emotional pain and suffering it's hard to describe. Written by a Jewish man who is a doctor, a psychiatrist and a Buddhist, the book provides insight from several cultures, several belief systems and from the kind of professional/personal introspection that is invaluable. It helped me at a time when I was uncertain how to face another day. Get it. Read it. Give it."
4,Very Enlightening,"Mark Epstein is brilliant. I have a Ph.D. and still found this book a little cumbersome to read. Nonetheless, I thought it was really great! If you like to read philosophy and want to learn more about buddhism and acceptance - this is a great book. I learned a lot about how to put acceptance into practice. If you are really stressed out and want a book that gives you tips on how to use acceptance and other strategies check out this book my book in which I quote Dr. Epstein:Active Relaxation: How to Increase Productivity and Achieve Balance by Decreasing Stress and Anxiety"
4,Buddhist thought contributes to Western thought,"This a terrific blend of Buddhist thought with the ideas that inform much of Western Psychology. The end result is great book that just might, in very practical terms, help you undestand yourself better. It's an accessible read that doesn't attempt to be deeply philosophical; instead it aims to be more practical. To be sure, at times, some of the ideas may appear obtuse if you haven't had much exposure to Buddhist and Psychological thought. But like most ideas and abstractions, it's talking about them that makes them complex, NOT the ideas themselves. Acutally, once you sort of ""get it"", the book is terrifically illuminating and thoughtful, yet very easy reading.For some of the more heady scientific and philosphical ideas and arguements that inform modern Psychiatry, read Elio Frattaroli's HEALING THE SOUL IN THE AGE OF THE BRAIN. That book makes some complex ideas read like common sense."

That book makes the complex ideas and philsophical arguements of modern Psychiatry read like common sense."
3,"Lacking true help, but full of personal Buddhist anecdotes","I expected the book to blow me away with profound help and truly insightful advice, but instead it was more of a Buddhist trip down memory lane. The writer also forgets his audience and it does get a little tedious. His sentences structures are also a little confusing at times. Not a bad book, but unless the reader has some knowledge of Buddhism, it is a little hard to grasp."
5,Going To Pieces and AA,"The idea's expressed in this book are not at all incompatible with those of Alcoholics Anonymous. In fact, the idea's in this book dovetail nicely with the AA philosophy of finding oneself through self-forgetting, or getting out of oneself, rather than the usual psychotherpy method of just building up oneself through endless analaysis. After 10 minutes of meditation, really just doing nothng, which I found to be quite difficult, I discovered just how wild my mind really is. This is a great book for those of us in AA who are just now discovering that getting to know ones own mind is the ulitimate altered state of conciousness. Oh no, Mark, I best not get attached to that thought!"
3,Alright,"Tastes like really strong vanilla at first, which is nice, but it leaves a makeup-y aftertaste. I ended up rarely using it, but for a cheapo flavored lip gloss, it's not bad."
1,Fugettaboutit!,"I bought this book and faithfully kept it with me during my two-week trip to Costa Rica in 2003. I went to a rural area on the Pacific coast where English speakers were few and far between. I found the phrase book to be annoying because everytime I tried to find something in it, I couldn't! All I could seem to find was how to ask a girl to dance or to ask if she has Herpes. The short phrase sections in the guidebooks I brought were much more helpful.And a tip: Ticos under the age of about 16 generally all understand some English thanks to the excellent Costa Rican school system whereas anyone over 30 is hit-or-miss."
1,Bad mistakes,"Just for the author's attention in the dating and romance section the phrase ""sacate"" does NOT mean take off your clothes, and it can be taken as a very vulgar remark in Spanish. Just one many mistakes in Spanish that this book has."
5,Dialogue & Dialects,"This little phrasebook is invaluable because Costa Rican Spanish is dialectical! Another book I found that spoke to Costa Rica's idiosyncracies was ""Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made,"" sort of a hybrid of a coffee-table book, a social/ politcial discussion and a geological history of the country in a series of essays and sidebars. It truly does lives up to it's scope of topics. Aside from geology and social history, it covers the political and economic history of the country and emphasizes its liberal reformist tradition as exceptional in Central America.A series of essays by the two authors A good read, especially while one is traveling because the 2-30 page segments stand on their own."
1,This book doesn't do the job.,"Recently, I read this language guide from cover to cover. Other than a few Costa Rican expressions it is no different than any of the 100's of books of this type for travelers.It wasn't even written by a native Spanish speaker or a person who has lives in Costa Rica on a long-term basis.I'm a bilingual Costa Rican.I guess Lonley can sell a lot of these books because of their name alone while scarificing quality."
5,Best Thing I Could Have Read,This book is amazing-- full of useful phrases and information. And the author is SO hot.
4,Fun And Fulfills It's Purpose,"Hi, I found this book to fulfill it's purpose of being a quick reference guide for the basics of Costa Rican Spanish. While not exactly correct in all areas, it is in most. I don't think one should use it to try to become an expert, it's not intended for such. It is true that ""vos"" is used much more often than the ""tu'"" (you) form and ""usted"" is used more often than both. I will tell you that I have heard a few Ticos using ""tu'"" in informal situations and often receive e-mails from my Tico friends using the ""tu'"" form so it's not completely uncommon. To cut it short, no, it is not a Spanish textbook and I don't believe it was supposed to be but it certainly more than gets the job done, especially for the price, it's a good deal. For compactness, ease of use and value, I haven't found anything better so far. I also found it to be a fun little book."
2,Clip Inadequate,The case is very strong and has protected my XDA for several years. However the belt clip is flimsy plastic and broke pretty quickly.
4,beautifully unusual!,"What a find! Folksy, bluesy, and soulful pop. The vocals really soar through the storytelling. And the music is light where it needs to be and heavy when it should be. I'd like to hear more from these gals!"
4,Awesome alarm sounds,"This is so cool! it has the best wake up alarm ever! I love this clock. The only reason I could not give it 5 stars is because even with the manual the controls are hard to figure out, but with practice it is an awesome clock."
4,Makes it fun to wake up!,My daughter got this for her 6th birthday. It was simple enough that she could quickly learn how to use it. She loved being able to choose the sound that she wanted to wake up to. The only thing I didn't like is that it's a little involved to set the clock and alarm. There is no way I could do it without the instructions even after doing it a couple of times. I am going to get the Buzz Lightyear version for my son.
1,"Looks cool, but what time is it?","The clock looks awesome. Every single person who has come into my apartment has complimented. But the thing doesn't keep time. After 1 day, it's four hours fast. I figured I had gotten the fluke bad one, then ordered another, which has the exact same issue. I contacted the manufacturer to see if they'd be able to provide one that worked, or knew of an outlet of where to get one. They basically told me it's not their problem. Amazon was fast with returns and refunds."
3,clock stickout off wall,"When I first saw the picture of this clock on the web site , I fall in love with it . it definitely looks different than the other gear clocks .it's big and has a turning circle wheel .really catchs people's eye , so I ordered without any hesitation ,but when I got it and hung on the wall . it just not looks right , it stuckout off the wall so much make it looks like hanging of the middle of the ceiling . I just can't put up with it . making it to fit all my other clocks , I have to take off the battery case and hiding it behind the wall ,that way it fits lot better looks much nicer and let the big wheel much more stable , but that's not a easy thing to do ."
5,"Fast Delivery, great price & a great item!",Speedy delivery to Denmark! Item received in great condition and well priced!! We had already one for our Singapore home (bought in a local store for SGD200) and is so in love with it. So we decided to purchase one more for our home here in Denmark! I am sure its going to be a head turner as it has always been before!! Thanks so much! ;)
3,"Great design, poor mechanics.","It's a great idea, but it falls short. It's made of okay material, but it likes to get stuck on the ridges from where you have to piece the wheel together. It just doesn't work or hold up like it should."
3,Love it!,I love this clock! It is obviously made of plastic in person that is not so obvious from the picture. The reason is the big dial comes in four pieces that you snap together. If you look closely in the picture you can make out two of the four seams. One is after the 10 mark and the 4 mark. Unfortunately the seams stand out in person. It still looks really cool.I love it and it's awesome and you probably won't regret it but it is not really worth more that $30 - $40.
4,Seriously Cool!,"I got this as a gift for my boyfriend (secretly I had my eye on it for me too). He loves it, everyone that visits us loves it. It takes a while to get used to reading the time on this clock, but it keeps perfect time. I shopped around for this exact clock on other sites, and this is the absolute best price!"
2,Not my best purchase...,"This clock looked pretty nice on the website and I was swayed by positive reviews and ordered it. The box was undamaged, but when I opened the item, I immediately noticed a large crack in one of the front gears. The clock is almost entirely plastic. It's a relatively light assembly and I didn't bother to piece it together once I saw the defect. I thought it seemed far larger than I expected and found that the diameter listed on the box was 22 inches! Beware...similar clocks available elsewhere on the internet are 14 inches in diameter."
4,nice clock,sturdy clock with a very unique look. it gets compliments often on its appeance. my only complaint is the noise level.
1,Wrong one!,"I didn't know there were different Q9 extended battery versions, so I ended up ordering this only to find it didn't fit my phone. Very bummed and got to send it back. :-("
3,Jessie Scott-,It was poorly written and it did not not keep my attention in most of the book. Will not buy another one like that. It did not cover anything like the title said it would.
4,Pretty Decent Setup,Put mine on my1999 Ranger 4X4 3.0 ....Got tired of oiling my starter and jumping thru hoops to change my oil. the filter is really tough to get to on that model truck...repositioned it under the driver side cab.......only short fall is no hoses...I needed 10 ft...$15 for oil resistant hose...pretty easy to install. has extra ports for oil pressure/temp sending units right out of the block!
4,A thorough guide to home food preservation,"This book is a detailed guide to preservation and canning of food at home. It contains detailed instructions regarding required equipment, methods, and recipes for most common foods that are canned or otherwise preserved at home. I found it to be an excellent guide to understanding the home canning process."
3,New Carrack CD- Sunday afternoon music,"The first thing one might notice about Paul Carrack's latest album is that he produced it himself. More often than not, self-produced albums do not represent an artist's best work.Individually, the songs are vintage Carrack; blue-eyed soul with strong melodies and thoughtful lyrics. Collectively, they comprise an album of music for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Missing from this recording is the punchiness of his previous work. There are really no uptempo tracks.Where Would I Be and Satisfy My Soul are the only obvious singles here. The Only One is a beautiful heartfelt ballad that Carrack sings quite low in his register with great effect.Athletes do not train without coaches. Singer/songwriters shouldn't record albums without producers. Even the best ever (The Beatles) employed a producer (George Martin). And Carrack would do well with a producer telling him he needs to kick it up a few notches on some of the tracks. Otherwise, it all sounds like Sunday afternoon."
3,Paul Carrack's new CD -- less than Satisfying?,"'Satisfy My Soul' is Paul Carrack's first solo effort since the critically acclaimed 'Beautiful World' album in 1997. Although the album offers a generous repertoire of 11 new Carrack tunes, the outstanding songs (and there are several) are lost between a fair amount of generic Carrack filler. Missing from this album are any up-tempo numbers. None. Zip-o. Instead, 'Satisfy' displays a full set of mid-tempo to balld-esque tunes which leaves you wishing Carrack would explore other avenues to break-up the occasional monotony of the album. Squeeze fans should note that Chris Difford co-writes several tracks with Carrack on this CD. Still, all in all, Carrack fans will still find 'Satisfy' fairly satisfying."
3,Science progresses,As science progresses it disproves what was believed before with a new set of rules. Everything is eventually is proven wrong. We therefore live with a false reality of understanding.This was the best takeaway from the book.
2,A new kind of hype?,"There is no physical theory that explains history, economics, etc. The wary reader should beware that wishful thinking has won over scientific criticism in this book. To be more specific, sandpile models do not explain earthquakes, turbulence, economics, and so on. Sandpile models are an interesting way of trying something new and stimulating in statistical physics but certainly cannot be elevated to the level of explaining the world. Fluid turbulence is not like dynamically an earthquake, financial markets are not like sandpiles, and Hitler is not explained by any model of statistical physics (need one really say this!?). The historians and biologists need not pack their bags and go home...(A physics professor)"
5,The next best thing,"Sure, one could spend more on a replacement APC battery, but why? This one works fantasmo. I've purchased a few of these myself and I know other IT weenies who've bought this product - no complaints whatsoever."
2,So-so,"I'm teach middle school English, so I thought this book would be a great addition to my library, since I have a lot of kids who ""hate"" to read. After going through the education program at my local university, I really heard about all these books (and have read most of them) in school, so I basically feel as though this book was a waste of money for me. The books that apply to kids who can actually read chapter books are few in number. I would only advise buying this if you are teaching the younger grades and are absolutely lost as to what to recommend they read."
5,The Wonder of Stevie....,My wife loves any music by Stevie Wonder and as her birthday was coming up I had to see what you guys had to offer.Boy what a choice I had in choosing a suitable CD.You made it so easy in making my decision as so much information was given.I knew the Definitive Collection would be my best choice.I was hoping the package would arrive in good time for my wife's birthday.No worries in that regard as it arrived in a few short days and in excellent condition.Best regards from John Good.
4,cool book!,what a cool book! I have one and I will keep it forever and look at it every so often. It's very nostalgic flipping the pages and pages of the glamour years and how much things have changed. I wonder if those pants-falling off style would make it to the glamour years for the future generation.
4,good ny blues,"Have actually seen these guys play (even though I live in Nashvegas). Guitarist is smooth and soulful. Hammond B-3 sound kickin', and great harp work. Worth the listen."
4,Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts,Pretty good reproductions. These were gifts and the recipients loved them. So glad that they were made available to the public to still enjoy.
5,Excellent DVD,"I think it's good to have an open mind about this DVD. It's pretty good, and not the cookie-cutter kind of DVD. I like the way it incorporates tai chi and even boxing moves into the routine. And the extra five-minute workout at the end is icing on the cake. I have been doing the cardio section (9-minutes long) 3 times per session, for a perfect 27-minute low-impact cardio-interval workout, and it has allowed me to slim down in a fairly short period of time."
3,"Big let-down, but it can still be fun","Let me start by saying that I have played WoW since the betas and loved the original strategy games for DOS. I enjoyed classic WoW and eagerly purchased this expansion, but man did things get screwed up with this. A lot of the game's balance was lost, and a big portion of the expansion felt like a grind more than anything. On top of that, the storyline which existed since the original DOS game was shot to heck in an attempt to dish out some social justice in taking a Horde race and giving it to Alliance players so they could have the shaman class, but that's another story all together!With that said, the game did add a lot of content, and flying mounts are fun. I also got an Onyxian dragon pet for buying the collector's edition that I can show off."
5,"Excellent, World of Warcraft is the Best Game Yet!","I purchased the game off of Amazon not too long ago and I must say its excellent. There's plenty of stuff to do and tons of people to play with. But be careful, you will most likely get addicted to this game. Also, World of Warcraft can be pretty complicated. I recommend reading up on guides for it by visiting sites such as http://www.hiddenstuff.com/ for strategies, tips, and such. But overall, this is THE BEST game I have played yet. A+"
5,A new way to feel your life slipping away from the comfort of your computer chair.,"I had given up World of Warcraft a while ago, only because I spent so very many hours playing that I wan't getting much else done.I should have know I couldn't stay away. A few weeks ago I got an email from Blizzard offering me a free ten day trial of this new expansion to their game. I ordered this collectors edition the next day.I had gotten the collectors edition of the original game. I liked much of the items it came with, especially the in game pets. I decided to pay the extra money for the collectors edition of this expansion for the same reason. It came with a few items I like better than the original including a mouse pad that is a map of the game world instead of just a cloth map. And once you activate the expansion, all of your characters can use the new pet, no matter how high your level."
5,So underrated/underappreciated,What a lyricist...dont understand how he hasn't gained more attention. Sharp and intelligent.... a must if you are an old school hip hop fan
5,useful basic data/error analysis text,"I had to write a quick review of this text given how useful I found it when I was using it (fifteen years ago), and how off-base the only other review is. The text was originally published in 1965 and it should be viewed in that context. Nevertheless, the scope of the book, the clarity of exposition, and the usefulness of the tools described remains a fairly unique and powerful combination. Given the price, I highly recommend the book to someone needing to occasionally do solid but unsophisticated analysis of fairly small, somewhat noisy empirical data. If from this point one moves on to more sophisticated and/or formal texts, I think they will further appreciate the qualities of this text."
5,A gifted scientist,Dr John Mandel was a Member of ISO/TC69-Applications of Statistical Methods. We exchanged textbooks after we met in Ottawa many years ago. Mandel's book is well written and reviews scores of numerical examples. I treasure my copy. Students of applied statistics may well find it as useful as I did.
3,somewhat dated statistical text,"This might be a good reference, but I wouldn't want to tryto teach subjects like linear regressions from this text.Error analysis is basic to science and in physics is part of every lab report,so if you asked someone to do an analysis of the population of flies ina box with a fixed food supply as living and deadwhich is a Pearl's distribution using this text,the student might have trouble figuring out what to plot.Since that problem is one of the basic ones in modernpopulation biology, the book would fail the student?but there is some good stuff here if you don't take this as the primarysource for study."
3,an early update will be much welcome,"The book is well written. Although there is a lot changes in the recent years, alos in terms of modality of programmin (Fortran), there is still little reflection of this in the book in teh code part. Also a CD with all the codes used in book is missing and would be worth to be included. The CD might include the codes written in other window application programming languages (i.e. C#, Visual Basic.Net and C++.Net"
5,this was great,"i thought this book was very cool. but i gave it to my friend bob laundhart, who worked at sunshine. he thought it was priceless. i can't find another copy of it anywhere."
1,Horrible shoes. DO NOT BUY THIS SHOE!!!!,"I got these shoes for nursing school and needless to say they are incredibally uncomfortable. I only wear skate shoes, but this design is horrible. It is narrow in the toe of the shoe so it crunches your toes together. DO NOT BUY THIS SHOE!!! I have worn these shoes once and will never put them on again."
5,C1RCA Men's Lopez 50 Sneaker,"nice design, good finish, comfortable, sporting a touch of discretion, informally useful in any situation where you need an athletic shoe that can combine with casual clothes."
2,dont run true to size AT ALL,"but a half size bigger or they will kill your feet after about 5 mins of walking. and as for skateboarding, these are not that great.. but they do look good with a pair of skinny jeans..."
1,Huge Waste of Money,"I bought Janis' Brand New Butt and More video and loved it, so I thought I'd pick this one up too. Huge mistake! Not only is the video super short, extremely grainy and blurry, but both the warm up and cool down are from the Brant New Butt and More video! Literally HALF of this is a copy-and-paste from another workout video, which is ridiculous. And the main part of the video is super easy and really didn't do anything for me. I like her other videos, so I don't know why she decided to release this debacle."
2,"Like instructor, didn't care for this one","I am probably an intermediate level of fitness. Started with regular standing/wear shoes warmup, then to pilates using band. Can be done without band (one person does workout without) but it seems a waste to do it without since they have designed the moves around having the band, specifically, for maximum effect. Like the instructor a lot, recommend her kickboxing workouts."
5,Santa and Son,"Back cover reads:She wanted Santa and she wanted him bad.Because Santa had messed up! The department store St. Nick had promised Jeanne Trent's son everything on his Christmas list, but the struggling young widow couldn't possibly afford to buy that much--even if she knew exactly what Toby wanted.Enter Ron Coleman, dashing reporter, who was keeping an eye on his grandfather. The elderly actor had a habit of stirring up trouble. His latest role as Santa was no exception.Only, this time, Ron was involved in the messy, wonderful life of Jeanne Trent. And he was beginning to wonder if it wasn't the best Christmas present he'd ever received..."
4,nice but not perfect,Very nice publication although very heavy with Triumph listings. Beautiful photography.
2,Snobbery,"I truly enjoyed Angela Thirkell's books, and sought them out, since happening upon ""Summer Half,"" in a thrift shop 15 years ago. I too, however, found the snobbery grating in ""Northbridge Rectory."" It seems to get stronger as the series progresses. I'm not sure whether it's that Thirkell got more reactionary as she got older, or I've grown more sensitive to it, but it definitely detracted from the fun for me. And give us a break, please. An ability to ignore the blatant snobbery is not a sign of sophistication and our discomfort with the mean spirit in Thirkell's depiction of foreigners and the lower orders is not childish. She clung to her middle, wanna-be upper, class superiority and vented her spite on forces she saw changing society. From accounts I've read by her sons Graham and Colin, she was quite an appaling woman. I feel sorry for what she did to Trollope's county, he had a much larger view of the world."
2,Story Fine but Snobbery Tiring,"I enjoyed The Brandons and August Folly, but the class snobbery in this book isn't funny. I found it more grating."
2,Absolutely,"Some Thirkell novels are delightful,but I also am under the impression that her writing changed over time. I found ""Northbridge Rectory"" and ""Marling Hall"" to have a mean spirited snobbery that I didn't like at all. Does anyone know which of her books are more like ""Before Lunch"" than ""Northbridge Rectory""?"
1,what happened to you?,"i remember this cat! he came out back in 89' with epmd. he had a hot little single for a minute called ""it's my turn"". he was the first cat i can remember wearing shiny pants like hammer on the east coast. he drop an album and disappeared. well no one brought it so that helped him alot. the video had epmd in it to try to boost his audience but he was lost. he had some tight dance moves in the vid though. i wouldn't recommend this cd though it's horrible. i peeped in a record store awhile back just for curiosity purposes. he will probably wind up like k-solo getting dissed on some hot rappers lead single. i want to really give him an 1/8th of an star just for attempting this again."
1,superb!,This is a superb book which breaks new ground and should be read by everyone interested in Nietzsche and his role in shaping 20th century German politics.
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"This book claims to present a paradigm for implementing games that learn. In reality it's a book about a very specific implementation of a very specific game. The ""paradigm"" is limited to a few very general observations that you could have made yourself. 95% or so of this book is code, and this reviewer was less than impressed with the quality. Clearly, the code in this book was developed as a hobby project by a couple of non-professionals who decided to make it into a book. They also decided to ignore the vast body of existing work on artificial intelligence and make simplistic claims based on their own experience about what is and isn't feasible in a computer program. You should be able to find better books on this subject than this one."
2,Not very professional,"I agree with the first review (one star...). However, the book could be useful for someone who is starting to make his way in learning in strategic games. I would also mention that 3'5 floppy comes with the book (C code for DOS platform) so the fact that 80% of the book is a source listing is annoying. Begginers would find first couple of chapters interesting though."
4,"Good Taste, Good Price BUT...","Good taste and good price at a buck a pack, but you really need to brown some ground beef and onion to punch it up. I've only had Stroganoff with BEEF and/or mushrooms as a 1-dish meal. I think this is great for the base of a 1-dish meal but I don't care for it by itself. I commend Lipton/Knorr's for this ""less sodium"" version."
4,Pretty good~,"This product is very good for the price. Very simple to make~milk, water, butter, and in about 10 minutes you have a great meal. Enjoy~!"
4,50% increase??,"product is good, but how do you justify a 50% increase in price? you were competitive, now, NO WAY. this happens a lot. trying to trick people. not ethical."
5,Response to not worth $1.20,".... This box set if for the new CCDAExam! First look at the publish date, its June 2000. Next how aboutgoing to the real source of true information, Cisco themselves. If yougo to Cisco Press (url)... You will see that this set is for the NEWCCDA exam. In the word of Cisco Press it says,""Cisco CCDAPreparation Library is a boxed set of three books. It contains twobooks that comprise Cisco's suggested training path for the new CCDAexam: Internetworking Technologies Handbook, Second Edition andDesigning Cisco Networks, along with the CCDA Exam CertificationGuide.""...... ....The best advice is for anyone pursing a Cisco certification, isto go to Cisco themselves and find out about the Exam and what booksthey recommend for the Exams. Then buy the books for the exam. Thisbox set DOES cover the current exam, I used it and the info in it isgreat not only to pass the exam but to give you a great understandingof networking in general."
2,Unknowm Item!,"Ordered this item mid July as it listed it in stock,never recieved item and finally recieved an e-mail from Sport and Sun claiming that I could recieve the product ""possibly"" in September. I work outside and I was looking forward to a hat that would protect my neck during the summer mths. Perhaps they can sell me a bathing suit in February!"
5,Safari Hat,"Wished I had this hat last summer when I was cutting grass and weed eating. It's great for protecting the eyes from the sun (even with sunglasses), the ears and neck. Would highly recommend it."
5,Extreme 45+ UV Flap Cap,"Affords great protection. Comfortable. Fits well. ""Keeper"" clip saved hat from the deep... I reversed clip's location to insidethe cap; dosen't interfer with flap that way. Highly recommend product"
5,Ra Ra is Off tha hook!,"I think that RA RA's album is tight even though he didn't stick around for any length of time he didn make his mark, which is a good thing. I think that anyone who like artists affiliated with Platinum Status and TUG will surely appreciate this album; Considering the fact that Platinum Status wrote and produced the majority of the album, with the help of Chris Stokes and Ketrina ""Taz"" Askew.Peace Nyoko..."
5,Full Support,All I gotta say is if You love the whole T.U.G family you gotta go cop this Album. Ra Ra album is full of tight beats from my boys Platinum Status. SO if you dont have it go out and get it!
4,Worked for me,I decided to try this when I was told I had developed periodontal disease and after using this product for 2 months my condition improved. No root canal for me (yay!)
3,not much difference,probably would help my breath if I could stop my bleeding gums first. Found another product and that worked for me.
2,eats batteries,"my biggest complaint with this scale is that it burns through batteries at an incredible rate, typically requiring a new battery every couple of months with even less than daily use. Replacement batteries--they are the specialized medical kinds, the quarter-sized disc--run about $8 - $10 at my local pharmacy. The cost of ownership is very high."
1,Looks Good-Bad Scale,"Bought this scale several years ago at a department store. Looks good but never gives accurate readings. My weight can change by as much as three pounds per day and sometimes give the same weight for several days. I have even weighed myself and then waited several hours, picked up a 1 1/2 pound weight, weighted myself again and still gotten the same weight. I should have taken back but didn't. This is a bad scale. Don't buy it."
1,Worthless,"This scale is worthless. It is completely inconsistent and inaccurate.My weigh-ins will jump by 1, 2, 3, 4 pounds all in a matter of minutes. Standing on it the same way each time, on the same flat surface, the readings are totally irregular.I can't recommend this for somebody trying to honestly track their weight loss.If you don't care about accurate readings, this scale is for you."
2,Very Inconsistent,"I should have returned this scale from the outset. It provides wildly inconsistent numbers. This morning, I weighed ten times, and my weight varied by as much 5 pounds. It is completely hopeless on tile, so we moved it into a closet. Unfortunately, it seems that any slight nudge will require recalibration. I'm done...."
1,The Nerve of HoMedics selling this junk,I cannot understand how a company can continue to sell a product that clearly works so badly. This product should be minus 5-stars. I never can get the same reading twice and so many people have had the same issue.
1,Never again,"My wife and I purchased this scale about a year ago at Bed Bath & Beyond. Big mistake. When it's not being erratic, it's consistently about 2 pounds high. However nice it looks and solidly it's built, it simply does not perform the most basic function required of a scale: accurate and consistent weights."
2,Inconsistent at best,"I've owned this scale for over a year - I find it frustrating because this scale was moderately expensive and gives inconsistent readings at best. I just did a test and weighed myself in 10 different locations in my house. I weight ten different weights, by several pounds. As a woman, I don't need this frustration. ;o) If your floor isn't perfectly level it will skew this scale because of the four balance pads underneath that actually ""weigh"" you. Not to mention that my weight can change on this scale by five pounds or more day to day. I am wishing I had my old school dial scale back.It is an attractive scale and easy to read. Just don't stub your toe on it. (ouch) If I had to do it over again I would not purchase this scale. Especially not for fifty dollars. I can verbally abuse myself for free thankyouverymuch."
1,Inconsistent- wish I'd read the ratings before purchasing,"I bought this scale because it looked nice. Unfortunately, that's about all. I cannot get a consistent reading. It's very strange: I'll get the same reading three times in a row, then leave the room, come back in, weigh myself again and get a completely different reading three times in a row. I'm talking about fluctuations of three or more pounds in the space of 30 seconds. This is a terrible product and I would never recommend it."
2,"Looks nice, but I can never get a consistent reading","I really wanted to like this thing, with its attractive design, easy-to-read numbers and sturdy construction. Unfortunately, even though I placed it on a flat, hard surface as instructed, I can never seem to get a consistent reading out of it. This morning I stepped on it twice in row and somehow ""put on"" a pound and a half in the course of 5 seconds. I don't know if I got a defective one or what, but this machine drives me crazy. I can't recommend it."
1,Ive had a lot of trouble with this scale,"The company was very good about taking the scale back when it didn't work after a new battery was put in it. They sent another scale back and it worked for a month or so, but now it's not working again. I put in a new battery and all I got were 0's. Now not even the 0's show up. Very frustrating."
1,"Inconsistent. Thus, it's worthless.","I came to Amazon.com today to order a new scale to replace this piece of garbage, which my husband and I received as a wedding gift off our registry a few years ago. This scale is so incredibly inconsistent. I can get on it 5 times in a row, and get 5 different weights. And these weights aren't within .1 or .2 of one another. No, the weights are often several pounds off. I am tired of this scale, and will be replacing it with a much better brand."
3,Accurate but Faulty Quality,"I did not notice problems with accuracy, and I followed the instructions and re-calibrated it each time I used it (step on it lightly, but step off, then step on again) but after two weeks the scale went caput. I'll give it three stars because the letters are large and it's a pleasant scale... It just has this quality control problem."
1,Short lived and hard to get a consistent reading,I bought this scale 5 months ago based mostly on appearance.The first thing I noticed was that it was difficult for me to get a consistent reading. With repeated weighings I could get reading to reading variations of 1.8 lbs (even when trying to be very smooth and consistent about how I stepped on it). My final solution was to use the median value of several successive readings. Tedious.This morning I noticed the LCD display has malfunctioned (not all the segments will light).I think my next scale will be the mechanical dial-style.
2,Don't Bother,I have owned this scale for several months and am now in the process of tossing it in the trash. I can never get a consistant nor accurate reading - gaining and losing 2-3 pounds over the course of several minutes! It's great to look at but that's about it.
4,80386 assembly language,Sorry for using wrong protocol!I would like to have a look at your book with full tutorials to eneble me do my final year school project. I am just but student. Please help because I am studying at one of an african university in africa.
1,HELLO!!!!!,"Would you idiots that post these ads please look this boot up on your site by name, Western Chief Mens Expedition Steel toed Boot, look at the picture that comes up, that is what a person receives when they order this boot, and when they order the shoe they get thE boot, MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SOME THERE HAS A BRAIN AND CAN FIX THIS. Now I have been told that you don't care, that a person just has to return the wrong item and wait 4 weeks to get hteir money back, well thats real BIG of you. PEOPLE PLEASE NOTE THE BOOT YOU THINK YOU ARE ORDERING IS NOT WHAT YOU WILL GET, AND THEN YOU WILL WAIT 4 WEEKS TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK AND AMAZON DOES NOT CARE. AS You can see they have been told about this and refuse to fix it."
3,Nice size and display but disappointed with the image quality,"I bought one from Costco and already returned it after one week. 50% of the pictures taken outdoor were blurred, maybe from handshake. The VR is probably not effective per Hiram's review. Otherwise, it is pretty nice and solid camera. The video quality is pretty good. Interface is good. I just found out another colleague had bought one too and he is complaining about the blurred image issue. I am now considering the Nikon S50."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA- Lens Error,"I bought this camera December 31, 2007. I had received some money for Christmas and decided to buy a camera with it. I went shopping and after about 2 hours, I finally picked this camera. While traveling through California on a recent roadtrip, I got my camera out to take a landscape picture and I got a ""Lens Error"". I had this camera for less than 7 months and it broke on me. I have read other reviews and it appears this is a common problem for this make and model. I take very good care of my cameras and I usually replace them after 3+ years because of technology, not because they stop working. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!"
1,Grainy pics,"I have two of these cameras. One takes decent pictures, but not great. The other only takes decent photos on a bright sunny day, otherwise the photos are very grainy. All of the settings are the same on both cameras. These camera's were purchased for my kids, and were an attempt to give Nikon another chance after being disappointed by a cheaper Coolpix model. No more chances for Nikon compact cameras."
1,Not up to Nikon's Standards,"I purchased this camera for my daughter in 09/2007.It seems like a pretty good camera.I've not been too impressed with the image quality considering the higher resolution of this camera. I've gotten much better pictures from my old Olympus 2.1 MP digital camera. Guess it's just a matter of the Olympus having a better lens.Now (01/2008) the S200 has stopped functioning. All I get is a 'lens error'.I sent the camera to Nikon for warranty repair. They are voiding the warranty due to damage to the camera case. This camera is extremely susceptible to scratches and dents on the exterior due to the aluminum case.I was going to purchase one of these cameras for myself, now I don't think I will.I expected more for Nikon. I won't make that mistake again."
2,Never got good pics with it...,"I've used the Nikon brand for years. My first Nikon was a SLR and I believe this was my 3rd digital Nikon. My first 2 Nikon digital cameras provided me with stellar service and provided me with pretty good digital pics in the dinosaur age (2MP and AA batteries!) Both died when they were dropped.I got this one a few years ago. Ironically, this one has survived longer than the other two but I never got good pics out of it. It's a nice sturdy camera, with 7.1MP, which was good when it first came out. But the lens is really small. Like some of the other reviewers said, the pics were grainy. And another complaint was that I had to install software to download pics.Anyway, after suffering through a couple of years of grainy pics I ditched this and got a Panasonic instead."
1,Bad photo quality,"The first thing I want from any camera is the ""good photo quality"". But this camera gives bad indoor photo quality, outdoor photos are okay; but you won't always go outside to take pictures. I am very disappointed with this camera and do not understand how other reviewers have given 5 star ratings. Could anyone tell me how to get better photo quality for indoor pictures from this camera?"
3,Does the Job,"I used this same model for work. I am not a professional photographer but take pictures of job sites to better communicate with my technicians. It's simple enough to use and understand.I bought this model to replace the one I broke at work. The only difference I see is that I cannot adjust the flash on normal shooting mode. There are ways around it so I didn't really see the benefit in going through the hassle of returning the item, plus it was used. Overall I'm happy with the product since I'm not using it for nostalgic family pictures."
1,Very bad experience with Nikon S200,"Nikon Coolpix S200 7.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical ZoomI bought Nikon S200 because of the brand and my past experience. I got worse camera and service I ever had!!Pros:1) good design2) Nikon brandCons:1) All blurry pictures from day one.2) Awful colors3) Grainy pictures4) Extremely blurry in-door pictures5) Horrible service: I sent camera to the Nikon repair (it is under warranty) in late December - after seven weeks - no camera and no news. I rang 5 times - I had never got clear answers from the service center. It seems for me the Nikon has absolutely unreliable, hostile and incompetent service I have ever come across!!6) Guess what? I rang on the sixth time - the Nikon had system down and no help as usual.Try to avoid this camera. And stay away from this brand at least for a while."
1,Very Disappointed in Image Quality,"While I found the camera easy to use, the image quality is completely unacceptable. Unless you're in full sunlight, the image is grainy and the colors wash out to a miserable grey. I tried various settings and could not get it to take a decent picture indoors, even with the flash.In some cases I was able to compensate by reducing resolution of the final picture, but if I tried to do any cropping or enlargement, the results were disappointing. This 7 MP camera is far worse than my previous 3 MP Kodak model. I thought that buying Nikon would guarantee decent quality, but I was mistaken."
5,Great quality and taste!,"I was away from almost all civilization and wanted chrysanthemum tea so amazon.com saved me by selling it online. I received it in great strong packaging (perhaps too much since it was a box with the product and filler within another box). The flowers looked clean and fresh and when brewed it produced a nice light yellow tea. It tastes just as good or better than the usual Chinese chrysanthemum tea I'm used to, so I'm very happy with this product. I would also highly recommend buying loose leaf or loose flower teas so you can adjust it to your own or guest's tastes!"
4,Seductive and rich storytelling with black humour,"Harold Prince's storybook concoction of an almost-impoverished countess in Bavaria (deliciously played by Angela Lansbury in one of her unjustly-forgotten performanaces) is based on the novel ""The Cook,"" which was good but vastly improved by Prince's vision. This film is part romance, part thriller, part mystery, and part black comedy. Michael York is the perfect blend of romantic icon and creepy schemer. Anthony Corlan is dreamy. Jane Carr gives a smashing and hilarious performance, especially when she enjoys a little prebreakfast chocolate cake. (Many of you might remember Jane from ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" with Maggie Smith or in later years as a cast member of ""Dear John"" with Judd Hirsch.) This has been a personal favourite film of mine for years. It will appeal to cynical romantics as well as to lovers of the old ""Fractured Fairy Tales."""
1,Bad Customer Service,"My player has problem with the car power cable. I have to make more than 10 times calls to the customer service and still get no replacement. The first time, they sent a wrong cable and then they promised to send another one. The cable has never been arrived. I finally found out that the cable was out of stock after a few phone calls, but the customer service always tell me that they have sent the cable. RCA has really bad unprofessional customer service, they will 'ping-pong' you to other department until you get fed up and tired. I will never buy a product again with RCA or Thompson label on it."
3,GOOD FOR A FEW MONTHS,"I BOUGHT THIS PLAYER FOR A TRIP TO MIAMI, IT DID WELL FOR A WHILE, BUT A FEW MONTHS LATTER IT DID NOT POWER ON. MAKE SURE YOU BUY WARRANTY ON IT."
1,"Faulty player, BAD Customer Service","I purchased this unit and like other reviewers, mine worked fine for a few weeks. Then the skipping began. Rather than go through the hassle of returning it, I just dealt with having to stop and restart the unit. I did this for a few months until one day it just never turned back on. Fried. Dead. Only six months old. We sent it in over 2 months ago for service and have never heard another word since. I finally called and was told at least six more weeks until they can tell me something because RCA was just bought out by Alcoa???Don't buy this unit. Spend your $200 elsewhere!!!!!"
1,Good start then it failed,"This worked well for about 3 months then it stopped playing some disks and then stopped playing more and more, now nothing works on it."
4,Many Happy Returns,"On the way home from another long car ride, I knew I needed to share how much I love this machine! It doesn't have a battery backup, so you have to plug it in, but that's not a big deal for us since we have several outlets in our van. It works perfectly for us, with one child watching a video and the other playing the video games it keeps them both satisfied in the backseat. It also has worked time after time for us. We've owned at least for a year. Now, the video games are not xbox or ps2 quality, but they work just fine for us. One of the best features is the way that you set up the headrest mount which each unit slides in and out of very easily, which makes switching videos easy and taking just the machines inside the hotel so that there's no risk of anyone stealing it out of the car. Our previous Durabrand machine was low quality and you had to set it up EVERY time you wanted to play it. Also, switching the secondary unit from video to video games is a breeze!"
3,"Flawed, but good for the price??","I'll keep this short. It does/did what we want...keep out kids happy while driving. However, my unit's just a hair over the 90 day warranty and it's already starting to flake out. At first we assumed it was a scratched disc, but new or old the skipping was so bad to stopped using it on the last trip. In addition this doesn't include a battery and though the ""manual"" (large piece of paper) mentions a slot for a battery expansion I can't find this magical battery for sale anywhere. Even the official RCA site lacks any mention of it. *sigh*"
3,Loved at first ... then disappointed!,"When we first purchased the unit, it was fantastic! It is very thoughtfully designed. Very well priced. We have used it some, but not extremely heavy use. We purchased it at the end of March for spring break trip. In the last month when we use it, the children will be 1/3 to 1/2 way through the movie and it will freeze up - it's almost as though it gets too hot. It remains frozen or continues to ""studder"" to where they can't finish the movie. What is dissappointing is the warranty is up and we have to pay for labor to have it checked out and fixed. Labor can be unbelievable! Are there any 2-screen units out there that are reliable for under $200?"
2,Truly dissapointed,"I bought this dvd player so that my kids..all 3 of them, would be entertained on a 6 hour trip to Silverwood. We were 1 hour into our trip when my 16 year old son decided that he wanted to play a game on one of the units. We turned it off and hooked it up according to the directions, but no games. We finally figured out that the main unit was not getting any power, but when we plugged the power into the second unit it was getting plenty of power. I am sending it back in order to get a replacement. If the second one fails, I will be getting a refund and suggesting that nobody purchase this unit."
2,8 month life span!,"Sadly, after only 8 months, this player has died. It only has a 90 day warranty and after that you have to pay to have it fixed. After labor and S/H it will be cheaper to buy another one (different brand, of course!) Other than that, it did work fine. It had a nice picture and sound for the time we had it. It did not, however, play dvd-r's as stated in the manual. Our kids (both toddlers) loved it. We used it almost daily and on long trips to Orlando and N. Fla. I have read the reviews about this and similar products and we all seem to have the same problem. I am now thinking about buying them each their own portable player."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this unit from Best Buy. It was gently used 9 times and began to skip and not read the DVD's. Geek Squad told us it was too expensive to fix and suggested we contact RCA. RCA has had our unit since 9/14/2007 and has not sent the promised replacement unit or made any decision on a refund. I have made numerous phone calls to RCA and Best Buy. Neither company is willing to help. RCA states they do not have supervisors that can assist with customer complaints, Best Buys states I should have purchased the extended warranty. I have many electronics made by RCA and would not ever buy another based on this experience."
1,Low to no quality product,"Like many of the other reviews here, my unit also died within a few months of service. Of course, past the limited 90 day warranty period. At first, the car adapter died. Then the main unit also started skipping. I had to restart it and only once in a while it would work. Then, it completed died. This product is almost of no quality, and based on the other reviews here, I'm not going to bother to deal with the bad customer service. This one's headed for the junk pile. I'm guessing that the person who wrote the very lengthy positive review on this product works for RCA or some related company."
2,Great package that died after some use,"Bought the product to take on a long trip. It's a great set up with everything you need. But after a few hours of use, it no longer wants to power up. I'm not sure what the problem is, but for the price and functionality, maybe it was just too good to be true."
1,Worked well for 3 months,"This product worked well for 3 months but then suddenly stopped working. I emailed RCA about this and they never responded which is totally unacceptable.So, basically I am out nearly $200 for 3 months use. Due to the limited warranty on this item, if i were to fix it, I would have to pay for the labor. I might as well just buy a replacement! What a ripoff!"
2,RCA DUAL,"ONLY LASTED FOR 3 WEEKS AFTER THAT AND WITH PERFECT CARE.. THE MAIN UNIT STARTED TO SHOW DISC ERROR, NO DISK IN UNIT... ETC ETC... IT'S NOT WORKING PROPERLY... SOME TIMES READS THE DVD ... AND SOME TIMES GIVE THE DVD ERROR.. WHILE USING THE SAME DVD. I RECOMEND PURCHASING A LESS FRAGILE DVD PLAYER."
2,modification needed to fit,Dashmount didn't fit exactly like it should have. I had to make modification for it to fit in my 2006 chevy aveo.
3,"looks great, but tight fit","Just got this dash kit a few days ago, and while it looks great, the process of getting the head unit in was exhausting! Very very VERY tight fit and barely enough room for the radio to go in."
1,You're Such a mark.,"This book is a huge disappointment. I ordered it after listening to the author on the radio. It sounded like a fun thing. But the author is obvously out for the almighty buck. The print is in 20 point type. You could read it across the room! Only 2-4 names appear on a page. Many common names, like Gordon, are missing, but you can find Jazzberry. I didn't know there was such a name as Jazzberry. Eight pages are devoted to a list of names coming out in the 2nd and 3rd editions. For the price of the book, I expected the author to have included all those names and more in the 1st edition. But no, this author is into selling T-shirts and mugs (literally for sell at the end of the book -15 to select from) Save your money. It just feels too much like a rip off to get any enjoyment out of it."
1,You're such a Casey,"The last person was right. The font is HUGE and BOLD and there are hardly any names in it. Go to the bookstore and read it there, don't purchase it. It's not worth the money. Sorry Casey. And my name wasn't in it. Which makes it worthless to me."
1,You're Such a Dave,"I purchased the book on a whim, unfortunately, and am very disappointed. Like the others, I'm offended by the huge font and short list of names. But I am even more offended since I heard her interviewed recently and she admitted that the book was written in about 3 weeks and is based solely on her casual observations. I wasn't expecting deep scientific principles here, but had she given it a bit more thought, she might have realized that her book is an embarrassment!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I wish that I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. I saw Casey Davis on TV and I thought this book sounded cool. The font is huge and the book only contains a few names. My name is very common and it is not in the book, so I wasted fifteen bucks. Don't waste your money like I did. This book was a complete disappointment."
5,Best,I absolutely LOVE this product. Everyone comments on what peaches and cream face I have and it is really is because of this product. It makes my skin feel baby soft and doesn't leave an oily residue. Plus it just feels so nice and light and smells really nice too. I really can't say enough good things about this face cream other than I will never use any other.
3,Face cream,I did not like this cream at all. It was very greasy and made mebreak out. It also seems to have quite a bit ofperfume in it so it also burned. My face is very sensitiveand this was not what a good product for a person who havefrequent facials etc...
2,A failed movie,"I loved Solaris and Stalker. Even more, 90% of the movies I watch are world cinema classics: Bergman, Fellini, Dreyer...But in my humble opinion this movie is too pretentious and falls short to guide through some spiritual journey. I think Tarkovsky failed in his attempt to create a parabole of the meaning of life.Another point I'd like to stress here is that at times, the movie seems to pay tribute to Fellini (8.5 comes to mind), only to be a dry parody of Fellini's dream images, filled with genuine mediterranean sensuality.You should watch it to judge about it."
1,Ugh !,"Got this book in a bargain bin. 1$. I shoulda bought a pack of gum or somethin'.Sophomoric and silly. Reminded me of my misspent youth in the 70's...sitting around, getting stoned...and commenting on how our whole universe is probably just a hangnail on some alien in another dimension. Or, how we are all descended from mushroom spores (which can survive in outter space didn't ya know). Pass the psilocidin, and see the motherworld!I guess I should go into what the book is actually about...but, since it's a 30 yr. old story, and nobody else seems to have written a review in all those yrs...like, what's the point?It sux"
4,absorbs facial oil,If you wear sunscreen and want to make your skin appear less oily this powder will help.
3,Okay for the price,I got this as a gift for my mom.Before giving i tried to use it for my backache.It seems okay.Its more like a vibrator than a massager.But i guess thats okay for the price.
3,it only vibrates!!!,it only vibrates...if u like vibrating massages...u will like it...powerful enough for using simple batteris...so its not so bad...but its just vibrations...
2,1 of the 4 did not work,"I bought 4 of this item, and, 1 did not work, even when replacing the batteries."
4,"Dang, is it powerful!","I test tried it at BedBath&Beyond and wow, it's so powerful it numbs after a while. Ehh...you can't y'know pleasure your lower regions without numbing it, darn...Great price for a little thing that delivers a powerful blow."
1,This is a vibrator NOT a MASSAGER!!!,"The video with the ad for this product shows it spinning around the handle independant of the ""feet"" like it is a massager, which is what I was looking for. But it is just a poor quality vibrator that rattles when turned on. Very deceptive in the description and video, I was very disappointed."
4,Very Comfortable Shoes,"These are very comfortable shoes. Easy on bare feet. Wore them barefooted the first time out of the box and had no rough spots or blisters. (cannot say that about some other boat shoes). If you like comfort and a very good looking shoe, this is it."
3,Size Changed ?!?!,"I have bought these for years, love them, have 3 pair and dump the dirtiest and buy a new pair every year or so. They USED to be made in China and I ALWAYS had 11.5 M fit perfectly. the last pair I ordered were 11.5M, same SKU and everything, but they are way too tight and say made in ... I forget, Dominican Republic I think. Anyway the size vs stated size is different. I shall now try 12M's and see."
4,"Awesome, comfortable shoes","Great shoes for a great price. Be warned, they run big. I wear a size 10 shoe, but ordered a size 9. I wore them all summer long, and hope to get several good years of wear out of them."
1,Should have listened to other reviewers,"Whilst the ""correct"" size I ordered was supplied by Amazon, they did not fit (too large) and with the back being straight, it did not matter how many pairs of socks I put on my foot or how tight I tried to fasten them, my foot still slipped out. Quite a few reviewers (even with higher star ratings) said the same but I did not listen to them. Whilst Amazon have a return policy, the postage back from Australia is so high, not worth it. The shoes (so called deck shoes) were also much stiffer and heavier than I imagined.So still completely happy with Amazon (not their fault) but will not buy Sebago again - I'll stick to Rockport whose shoes are the correct fit and design."
2,Wide 'nough to fit B I G F O O T !,Great lookin' shoe right outta da box. Buuuttttttt...the size 13N is W I D E R ! than any W I D E sized shoe I've ever had on! W O W ! What would their wide size be like?
1,Not happy.,"Bad fit, bad construction. After one day the stitching on the outside of the forefoot came apart. Inside, on both shoes, are long pieces of stitching taped down with what looks like packing tape. I don't know where these shoes are made, but the quality control is not there. Fit seems long. Width seems correct. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
1,Clovehitch and a scissors,"The shoelace was about 10"" on each side. Tying left ""bows"" bigger than bunny ears; or required ""double knotting"". Scissors might be called for because unable to replace shoelace. It is encased by heel leather as it travels around the back of the shoe. Just not good. Had to go back."
5,A REAL 3 EEE,"I have a 13 EEE size shoe this Sebago is super fit, its my 9th pair and they wear very well, i highly recommend this shoe. My whole life has been a Easter egg hunt for wide shoes, the only two companies that i buy shoes from now are Sebago and Alan edmonds hope this helps you!!"
3,Nice looking shoes but fit could be better,"This are very nice looking shoes and well made. But feels like requires a little break-in, 8 1/2 wide just not as wide as other brands. When I walk feels loose in the back and foot seems to slide towards the front of the shoe. Better cushion than Sperry Classic and good deal from Amazon."
4,"Yep, they're traditional boat shoes...","Nice looking, but a little TOO two-toned for me, so I used brown shoe polish on the light tan leather parts and now they look like what I expected, a traditional brown boat shoe. Very comfortable, especially the more they're worn. I always have a couple pair of these shoes on hand and I live in them."
3,Something different,"The leather on this shoe is not as pictured. In fact I can't find this shoe anyplace else.The picture shows an oiled leather, but the shoe delivered was a polished leather with a smooth somewhat glossy finish. I am not sure what I got. In fact I wonder if it is a real Sebago. Sure as I say that I will probably find out it is. Considering this is my second pair I don't understand why they are different."
4,Sabago shoes,"This was my 2nd order: the first was way undersize for my 8.5WW. So I re-ordered size 9 WW. They now fit much better, perhaps a tad loose. Returning the shoes from Africa is not an option"
5,Perfect,"Because of nerve damage in both feet, I am careful about the shoes I wear. Shoes which are too soft in the sole create significant balance problems for me. I typically wear Dansko Klogs which work great for me, but are not always appropriate to wear - with shorts for instance. I searched for ""hard Sole"" boat shoe and found the Sebago. When I need to dress up a bit and when I am just chilling, this shoe is perfect. I can be on my feet for long stretches, walk without doing the ""drunk walk"", and my feet feel good at the end of the day."
5,Sizing Misrepresented,"The purchase of this item was sought for a specific reason, sizing. The listing of the item specifically stated and I orderd a EEE width. The item when it arrived was labled WIDE. Clasically WIDE indicates that the shoe is a EE. The difference in width made it too small for me to keep."
2,Size does make a difference,"I was very dissappointed in my purchase. I ordered the 12EE, which should have meant ""extra wide"", but they are far from being extra wide, and longer than a normal 12. I could barely get my foot in them without a sock, but there was a good inch or more room in the toe. I have since ordered the 11 1/2 6E, and hopefully they will fit. If that's the case, I might change my review."
4,good boat shoe,"I had these shoes for about a year and a half. They look like you would expect a boat shoe to look. Held together well. I had to get rid of them because after they were wet for a while, it seemed like they shrunk & became too short. Overall good shoe though."
5,Outstanding product. Excellent service.,"This shoe manufacturer produces the best product available. Comfortable, stylish.And extremely well constructed. My third pair and I am still using the first two!!!"
5,I LOVE MY NEW SHOES,Extremely pleased with the shoes. Fit great and look great. Thank you! They are very comfortable. I hope to purchase more in the future.
1,poor quality,The shoes are poor quality with thin bottoms. They are no where near the quality of my old pair with the differance being the new ones are made in China. I do not blame Amazon as I buy lot lot through them and the service is great! Every time I buy a product from China I give myself a kick in the butt.
3,buffer,most us ok the buffer was a joke di not work well at all returned for a refund waiting on my money no more buffers
1,"Very uncomfortable, injured my feet.",Bought this for a cruise and after half a day my feet were bruised and in lots of pain. It mostly because the sole has little cushioning and its very stiff.
1,Design & sizing have changed,"I have owned the Clovehitch II (Walnut color - size 11 N) for 3 years and it was time for a new pair, so I ordered what I assumed was the exact same shoe. The new ones are more of a suede than smooth leather and would probably show spots and dirt more easily. The real problem for me is that they are also a lot wider. When I lace my old pair up tightly to wear without socks, the eyelet flaps don't quite come all the way together. When lacing the new pair up tight, the eyelet flaps come together before the laces are completely tight. These are made in the Dominican Republic, whereas my old pair was made in China - which is probably why these are different. Sebago probably shouldn't have kept the same name since the fit and styling have changed (albeit slightly)."
2,Very short on quality and fit,"Although attractive, they do not fit correctly. I am a 11.5M and had to return the first pair because the right shoe was 5/16 inch smaller across the width than the left. To be safe I purchased 11.5W. They fit better but do not fit my arch, nor any other part of my foot very well. I am sorry that I did not return these as well, but I kept them in the hope the shoes would break in to the form of my feet. So far the condition has not improved and I have worn them several times (SEBAGO's offshore supplier does not attend to a quality product, regardless of the price). Be safe and buy the SEGAGO ""Southport"". They fit very well and provide good support when you are on your feet for 10 hours a day."
5,Very good purchase,I did know the product and am so happy with it that I wanted an extra pair in an other color combination.In europe this color was not readily available so I ordered from the US (amazon.com)and after all it was cheaper(even with import taxes )than buying locally.To summarize : -Product is excellent-Price is very good-Delivery super fast
5,I'm on a boat!,"Well, I'm not on a boat right now, but I know that the second I find one I'll be on it in style. These shoes are so super-duper fresh, from the cool suede upper to the vented sides and extra firm-yet-comfy heel. I haven't yet braved the high seas in these babies, but I'm ready to do so with a pair of patch-work shorts and nautical hat, and a lacoste polo to boot.Seriously, I love these shoes. Extremely comfy, very durable, and the price was oh so right. If I had the cash, I'd buy five more pairs with all the colors they offer (I'm already eyeing those navy blues). Great seller too, fast shipping and the kind of service that makes you want to call their mother and let her know all that her hard work paid off.Buy with confidence!"
2,Comfortable Shoes but Paint Started Peeling Off,"These shoes are very comfortable and have stood up to almost 2 years of use. After only a week or two of use, the white paint on the side of the rubber sole began to flake and peel off. This is my only issue with the product, but it made them look a bit cheap."
2,"Poor quality, Great styling","I ordered these shoes in october, the first pair was peeling on the bottom of the sole were the beige sole meets the dark brown, I thought it was a manufacturers defect so I ordered a replacement and they did the same thing. They were comfortable and looked great too I would say better than the sperrys but quality is low super low I was really disappointed to see how easy it would peel. They are not $20 shoes, I think wal mart brand would hold up better."
3,"That'll do pig, that'll do.",This shoe is cheaper than the others but it actually is not a bad shoe. I wear it around the house and casually. Only bad thing to say is it takes a while to break it in. The leather is stiff. But otherwise worth the money.
1,ouch,"Admittedly I have a difficult foot to fit, so ordering any footwear online is a hit or miss proposition for me. These shoes are downright painful; disappointing considering they are considered a laid-back comfort shoe. I do not fault Amazon or Sebago. This is just a case of how badly I need to be fitted in-person, without the use of guesswork. I would also add that the actual product is much darker than the picture. It is an oil-treated leather, not wax-treated, so it will ultimately be a dirt magnet. As stated earlier, this is one occasion where I should have checked the product out in person."
2,IS NOT THAT TYPE OF SEBAGO EXPECTED.,"IS NOT THAT TYPE OF SEBAGO EXPECTED. IT'S ALL HAVE BONDED FASHION, THE MODEL IS BEAUTIFUL. BUT REGULAR SHOE, (IT NOT HAS WIRE). FOR THE PRICE IS VERY EXPENSIVE,, IS VULCANISED(NO ES EL TIPO DE SEBAGO QUE ESPERABA. ES TODO VULCANIZADO NO TIENE COSTURA, EL MODELO ES BONITO .PERO REGULAR ZAPATO. PARA EL PRECIO ES MUY CARO PARA SER VULCANIZADO)"
5,Exceptional shoe,"Shoe was great, but you sent me the wrong size 3 times. Ordered 11 2W and received an 11 W- 3 times.Wow!"
2,Too narrow .....,"Shoes are definitely too narrow....My usual size is EE , I bought Sebago 2W --- way to narrow. Had to exchange to 3W.Still narrow. If you have wide (I am not even talking about abnormally wide) foot, probably, better to look something also ....However, shoes look good and quality is OK"
5,"so far, so good","I received these Sebagos promptly, and the product is fully as described. The fit is fine and the shoes seem sturdy. No problems, but the telling on these shoes is long-term: I am accustomed to getting at least 5 years of hard wear out of boat shoes. I previously purchased Timberlands, but I decided to try something new this time around."
5,"Yum, yum, yum.","Just recently I started making my own Chinese dishes at home.And while this has been fun and challenging...with Iron Chef sauces? Why bother?I just bought a bottle of the General Tso's on a whim and it tastes JUST LIKE the best resturant variety you can imagaine.Certainly better than ANY glaze I have yet to produce. :(My cooking abilites (or lack there of)aside....Iron Chef, General Tso's sauce comes......Highly recommended.Can't wait to try all the others. :)"
4,It is a good start,"I found this to be a good introduction into the art of papermaking. It is basic, but helpful."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I was slightly disappointed by the contents of this purchase, online it looks bigger or alot more stuff. I am still happy with it because i will use it but not as i would have hoped.."
1,Poor Customer Service from Arnold Grummer Website,It'd be better to buy these products from Amazon or at Michael's. Don't order from Arnold Grummer's website. I called their service phone number 1.800.453.1485 many times but no one ever answered the phone. I sent emails through their website and no one ever replied. I can't get hold of anyone to tell me where my shipment is.
4,What?,"I really liked this book, even though the first hundred pages or so were hard to get into. You might enjoy jumping from character to character throughout a chapter, but find it jumpy and broken. Such plot lines sometimes leave me skipping entire sections to get to a narrative by characters I like. I, however, decided to slog through the book, and it gets much better as time goes on. My favourite characters, in order form most liked to okay then are Andrew, Sara, Falconer and then Olympias. The scene changing gets better later on, I think, because you come to like ALL the characters, so there is no need to jump ahead. I tend to judge on last impressions however, so I belive four stars is a good review."
4,Good addition to the series,"Olympias is the Chief Enforcer and Enforcer for the city of Washington, DC. As overburdened as she is, she is a little out of touch with the vampire problems in the area. A companion, claiming to be the reincarnation of her late husband, takes advantage of this situation to try to destroy her. Her loyal slave is distracted by a suicidal vampire, and Olympias herself is distracted by a human chosen by another vampire for her companion. Chaos will ensue if Olympias doesn't regain her grip on the local nests and their servants.This was a pretty good addition to the series. Olympias is alluded to in all of the other novels, but never much involved. This novel was fast moving and exciting and I look forward to the next one."
1,Beware of the misleading picture,"I choose this rating because of the misleading picture thinking it was the normal size bottle. Instead what I got was a very, very, small bottle, and for the price? What a rip-off."
5,Just starting Portugese language Course,"It is premature to rate the quality of the course. However, it has a large Portuguese-English Dictionary as well as an English-Portuguese one plus a volume of common speech PLUS TAPES WHICH ARE COORDINATED WITH THE TEXTS."
2,Poor Substitute,"If you are in a rush and want to learn how to say ""Where can I find a good restaurant?"" this is fine. It is, however, riddled with errors that will throw the beginner off track. A serious student will not get a solid foundation with this course. If you have the time and are dedicated to really learning Portuguese, get the real thing - Mastering Portuguese."
1,"Poorly written, poorly edited, very light on content","I was excited to find this book, an introduction to ERP in one slim volume.Unfortunately, the authors do not use their pages well. The book meanders (even more than one might expect from a ""novel""), the writing includes a definite Southeastern U.S. regional tone, and the editing is very poor (I spotted a number of grammatical errors and several instances where a sentence had been cut in editing and not repaired).Overall, this is a sloppy piece of work. One might expect better from a major publisher, but...I cannot recommend this book to anyone."
4,Common Sense Look at ERP,"What steps an organization needs to consider and take before moving into an ERP environment is given so simply in this book. Jacobs and Whybark present the facts in such a way that anyone in an organization understands that ERP is not a magical cure for their ills. Yes, this book is written very much like ""The Goal,"" yet one knows this from the start. Where is it written that such a book must be full of theories, processes and analogies that makes it boring and undigestable. I applaud Jacobs and Whybark for giving the business world an easy to understand and follow guideline for ERP."
3,REVIEW FOR STUDENTS,"I read this book as a requirement for my Management Informations Systems class. While it is a dry read, I acknowlege that it was a noble effort to present the information in the form of a novel. Do not read this book if you are an expert on SAP or very familiar with ERP systems. This is little more than a text book put in the form of one large example. Keep your expectations low and you'll be fine."
2,Pretty bad...,"Writing style and quality aside, the author does make some progress in giving an overview of SAP and the pros and cons of a ERP system.However, it was a very frustrating to read. The author even admits - in the text - that his characters are falling asleep over the content being discussed. All the useful knowledge in this 130 page book could be fit on 2 or 3 pages of a good textbook. Whether its through the ridiculous ""thought interjections"" from the main character about donuts or the meandering and irrelevant narrations, this book will kill a part of you that you will never get back. As soon as I finished it, I defenestrated the book in disgust and frustration."
2,A Painful Attempt to Turn Instructions into a Story,Most useful content from these 120 pages could be condensed in to a 2 page Wikipedia article (and likely already is). The author drops a massive load on the literary community as he attempts to wrap a case study in a relatable plot- careful to include light-hearted character quirks. You might sit this one out.
1,Trash!,"This is the worst book I have ever read in my life. Authors would do themselves a favour if they have just written a decent 15 page scientific paper rather than this trash. Even 1 star for this book is too much. What makes it even worse is that stereotypes that these so called PhDs are projecting. These two should be banned from publishing and teaching. If anyone wants the book I wil ship it to you. For free. Otherwise, this is going into the recycling paper bin."
1,Why ask why?,"I picked up this little jewel hoping to learn something about SAP's R/3 product and believe me, it took some serious effort to plow my way through this loathsome tale. The Goal has been done to death by everyone, including Goldratt, and this book is a pale imitation of that classic novel. If you know absolutely nothing about MRP or ERP, then this book might be helpful. It does motivate the need for such systems and production controls in general. The book also has some screen shots of SAP's product, so at least you'll have some basic familiarity with that system before you see it on a workstation. I think I'd rather read the User's Guide to R/3 (or to my VCR) than read this book."
1,Very disappointed!,"I should believe other readers on this book. However, I bought this book because it's a required book for my class. Otherwise, I wouldn't spend time to read it after the 1st chapter. This book is a replication of ""The Goal"" -but uncomparable. ""The Goal"" is now the major reference -but not for relicated. I think the authors could do better than they did on this book; just only they don't think too much about ""The Goal"" and tried to do original work."
3,Why bother?,"If you have woodworking skills and appreciate appropriate materials, this may not be a good choice for you. This kit is nicely priced (and this is usually a good thing), but the materials are so low-grade that the finished project was not worth the time I wasted putting it together."
1,Anything but this.,"I **love** all of John's ensemble discs, the Kropffganss , Kohaut, and Hagen. This one...is dreadful. He manages to toss off this most endearing and engaging music of the galant lute repertoir with an air of utter contempt. This is a graceless, breathless, bloodless misrepresentation that reinforces the stereotype that this music is trite and fluffy. He has invested nothing in this recording, neither should you. Sorry to have to do this. So disappointed. Buy the Kohaut instead. John, please try this once more, with feeling."
1,Not what is describe!,Item is not what was described in description or on box or in box and package was sealed. So it was returned! Not happy since I have a lot of 3 1/2 x 5 photos. It happened twice from two different sellers.
1,Was not the right item.,"I purchased this item thinking it was new. I finally got the item and found that it was opened at one point and just resealed. Said to myself, no big deal as long as the sleeves are in good shape. Opened the boxes to find that they had the wrong pages in the boxes. This is upsetting considering that there is a picture on the front of the box showing the right type of pages. Now I have to wait again for new ones to ship from another person as I return these and wait for my money.... In the end I have 30$ tied up in all this....not happy with this seller."
3,On Their Way...,"I heard ""Rise From The Ashes"" two days ago on a local radio broadcast called ""Homegrown."" I loved the song, and immediately e-mailed Rockin 101 to find out the title and the artist. I became an instant fan. The album is very reminiscent of Acceptance's ""Phantoms"" album. Lead singer Kevin Truckenmiller has a great voice, which is not as common as it should be in this genre. The music is not groundbreaking by all means, but it is still a very good summer album. The only problem I have with it is the remake of Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time."" Me First And The Gimme Gimmes already remade that song, and because these two bands are in the same genre, I do not think that Quietdrive should have touched it. Other than that, you will not be disappointed in buying this album. A great debut from a band who is on its way to something bigger. P.S. The Truckenmiller clan are cheaters for posting a review (and I LOVE it!)"
3,...,"the first 2 or 3 songs are good, then they slow it all down... WHY DO BANDS DO THAT???? Jesus Christ!"
4,Sunshine On A Rainy Day is a fantastic song,Sunshine on a Rainy Day is one of my favorite songs. It is a great pop song.
4,Cute,"I like these chimes, cute and sparkly. The angels look alittle fake but when do you ever get that close to look at chimes."
4,Assessment for Children and Youth with Special Needs,This is a very great descriptive book about assessment. It guides and models some awesome assessments to use within the classroom.
4,Great Value and Useful Resource,Was so excited to save money on this product rather than buying it at the more expensive university book store. It was a great value and much needed resource.Highly recommend and would definitely purchase books online from you again in the future. Was loaded with terminology that was useful for the course and really was a valuable aid to achieve an A in the class. The educational terms were clearly laid out in a well designed format.
3,Required by class taken by professor,The class was tailored to the text as the professor was one of the authors. The book had numerous small errors in page references that frustrated this time crunched student. The book seems suitable for graduate and undergraduate work but geared heavily toward younger populations of students.
2,Several Errors,"There are several errors with this edition of the book. There are things that do not mach up, especially if you take the quizzes that the book gives you. This company needs to do some checking before they issue something like this."
4,poetry with a musical foreground,"JEWEL HAS DONE IT AGAIN...SHE ONCE AGAIN SHOWS OFF HER RAW AND NATURAL POETIC TALENT! BREAK ME REACHES INTO THE SUBCONCIOUS LEVEL AND TOUCHES THE PART OF YOU THAT WANTS TO TRUST. THE EMOTIONAL CONTENT OF THE SONG IS ONLY MADE MORE INCREDIBLE BY THE HAUNTING BEAUTY OF HER VOICE. IT WILL LEAVE YOU HUMMING IT'S CHORUS.IF YOU ENJOY THIS SONG, YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO PICK UPSWALLOW THE MOON-JEWELJUPITER-JEWEL"
2,Good Boot Leaves Bad Taste In Mouth!!,"Thought this was some new candy shaped like a boot, based on the ""chocolate"" mentioned in the add. Little did I know that it was just the NAME of the color and had nothing to do with what it was made out of. I broke off two of my teeth trying to bite through the toe, then gave up.Later, I noticed it hadn't melted yet and decided to give it another shot. The smell hit me and I shook my head: it's a BOOT, NOT a chocolate bar!!Somewhat comfortable, but need to break them in more. Nothing too exciting about them, they're boots!"
3,for fans only,"This is a rerecording of some of thei best songs, it's OK but not as good as the otiginals, so now that they have been reissued, go for the new ones, with two LP's on one cd they are probably the best value on earth."
1,Cats are not thrilled with this ball,My three Turkish Angoras are normally very playful animals. They just sit on the sofa and watch this ball on the floor. It does not seem to stimulate them in the slightest. They have not played with this ball once in that last 2 years.I would not purchase this product again.
3,Nothing Will Keep You Cat Happy Forever,"This is a cool little toy with an inside ball to keep the outer ball rolling in different directions, making your cat think it is a real thing. However, a simple ping-pong ball also works well. But it is cheap. If you can find the ball that has a magnet and batteries inside, THAT is the one to get - I forgot its name, but it will make your cat go nuts!"
4,We like Max & Ruby,"Rosemary Wells has created two great brother and sister characters in the Bunny books, as well as the Max board books. Ruby is the responsible, if slightly bossy, older sister, and Max is her younger brother intent on doing what he wants. Ruby is throwing a party where most of the guests are her dolls and toys, and Max wants to invite some of his toys, too!There is a lot of counting, which may go over better with the four to eight year old recommendation, but this is still a fun book to read with a younger child. Ruby is a fun character to read aloud."
5,Just what I wanted,"Upon purchase of a Palm Tungsten E, I immediately sought a hard case. Reading some of the Amazon reviews of the PalmOne offering made me a bit nervous. I decided to try the Innopocket offering, in large part because of the belt clip feature. All ports, speaker, accessible without opening case. Secure closing but easy opening. Well designed, well made, and just what I wanted."
1,Pretty Much Junk,I didn't like this case at all. It was hard to open and the metal was cheap looking. I went with the DS case instead. IT'S MUCH BETTER!!
2,Disappointed,This wine fridge was louder than I thought and did not hold as much wine as it said due to different sized wine bottles.
3,It works.,"It wasn't made for the 08 suzuki, but works fine with a little modification. Also, the trim piece didn't fit around my double din stereo, so I had to take about 1/16"" off it with a dremel. So with a little modification it works.."
4,nice j.otto journey for very young readers,"A nice little dream journey by j.otto Seibold and V.L. Walsh for the very young book-looker. Chongo Chingi is a penguin who dreams of flying, all the way to outer space, then is woken up by the alarm clock. Very few words here, much fewer than most of their books. Also simpler drawings on most pages with a few spreads of the famously inventive j.otto detail. Might not appeal as much to older readers as most j.otto books but still recommended."
3,Disappointing,"Our twin daughters were a couple months shy of 3 when I got them this book. They like penguins, and I love Seibold's style of illustration. I picked the book up, looked at the first couple of pages, and bought it. I wish I had looked through it all. The first couple of pages there there were some well rhymed written blurbs to go with the pictures, but after that very little by way of words, so nothing to read. I don't mind the lack of story or the way ""jumps"" as others have mentioned, I am just bothered by the lack of readability. A gorgeous looking book and I love the feel of the cover paper and pages, nice high quality publishing materials. So, I am neutral on this book, depends on what you are looking for in a book."
3,"Smooth Transaction, slight defect on product","The transaction went smoothly, but there was a crack on the front part of the case that I did not recall reading about in the description. This disappointed me but I bought it more for the music"
1,Useless vibrating piece of plastic,"No offence to Homedics but this is a bad product. I have back pain on a daily basis and this massager didn't massage anything, it only aggravated the pain. The only thing this does is vibrate very lightly and if you have back spasms like I do, you know that unless someone is kneading your back (or simulating) your spasms will get worse if it's just vibrating. I got no relief from this."
2,Not at all what I thought it would be,"I bought this massager with the intention of using it to releave my shoulder and neck tension. Boy, did it not get the job done! It basically just vibrated on my muscles until it deadened them and put them to sleep. After I removed the massager, the muscle tension was still there. I would not buy anything like this again!"
1,Essentially worthless - less power than a gnat,Absolutely no power whatsoever. If you have true back or shoulder pain you are better off with a hand massage or standing under the shower. No power at all in this machine.
1,waste of money,I can't believe this product made it to market. It is awful. it DOES vibrate a lot. poor heat. what a joke. unfortunately i was too busy to return quickly and missed the deadline.
2,Not worth the money,"Product is not made well at all. Battery cover can not have any weight on it, or it won't work. We have to put a small folded piece of paper under it on one side so that there is no pressure on battery cover, then it will work. What a pain."
1,It is Useless,This keeps jamming and doesn't sort properly. Too many coins end up in the wrong cylinder. Don't waste your money on this thing.
3,Middle of the road,"Bought it at [...] a few years back. It is OK for less than [...] at a time, but jams easily. Now that it is old, it jams consistently and I want to replace it."
3,"It's ok, does the job",I have no issues with how it actually sorts the money. It gets the job done and the kids love it. I would HIGHLY recommend that you pay a little more for one that puts the money right into the paper wraps. It is a pain to pour the coins into the paper wraps.
2,broke after two weeks,"I bought this money mill bank for my husband to help organize his change. He used it for about a week, but from the beginning the motor would get stuck on when nothing was in the bank. Sometimes it would shut off if we shook it, but other times, we had to take out the batteries to get it to stop running. Then my seven-year-old nephew played with it for a few hours--repeatedly putting coins in, sorting them all, then dumping them and putting them all back through, and it stopped working completely. It would probably have been more worthwhile for us to get a slightly more expensive model that would be more durable."
1,Good as a toy,"I got this for my son and he did have fun with it, but I spent a lot of time trying to unjam the coins from the mechanism. As an actual coin sorter it stinks. The number of coins (or even the types of coins) that end up in each roll is fairly inconsistent. Also, it comes with a top to keep little fingers out of it, but there is no way to keep the top on, so my son got his finger caught by the rotating coin sorter once and was pretty scared until I could pry his finger out of it.I wouldn't reccomend it."
2,Money Mill Bank,I really like the idea of the money mill bank but after using it a few times I noticed a crack in the plastic all the way down one side and another one starting at the top where the lid fits. If it did not break I would be very happy with it.
3,It's ok...,I selected this coin sorter because they said it turned itself on and off automatically when change was inserted. Plus I knew someone who already has one of these and that feature works great... However the machine sent didn't have this feature. It does sort as advertised you just have to turn on with the switch which is very inconveniently located on the back. All in all.... It's just ok...
3,Coin machine,It was on my grandson's list. I had to return 2 times because it was broken either in shipment or broken in the box before shipment
3,Not what I expected,Was expecting it be automatic turn on when money is dropped in the chute. You have to flip a switch which is a pain. Would not recommend it.
5,Money Wrapper Well Done,I have hunted for this product for over 3 months. I have purchased others and took it back. Eventually I got this one from Amazon. I had it before and now I have another one. This is the one to get.
1,wrong decision,"Purchased this item to replace an old one which ceased to function. This one was overpriced but available. It arrived on time, but it was in many pieces as it had not been packed properly. The return policy was excellent and I received a refund very quickly. I decided not to replace the bank."
3,"Money Mill ""Type of "" Bank","I had owned a coin machine called the Money Mill and that was what was published on Amazon, however, when it arrived it had a different name on the machine, so I think this is a copy of the original. It worked fairly well so I kept it but I think it was falsely advertised as ""The Money Mill Bank."" The original was pressure activated so if it jammed, you could clear it easier. this has an up and down switch so it is not the same."
1,Defective,This was defective; didn't have switch. It was bought and sent as a gift. They didn't keep the box or invoice.
5,Fast service!,I bought this for a gift. I did open the box and see that only 3 coin wrappers were enclosed. I bought a bag of coin wrappers at the dollar tree.
1,iLife tries to clarify use of iLife.,"I bought this book. It was interesting. However, the overall presentation was still too technical. Much jargon. It tried to define problem words by using the problem word. I'm sure it is excellent for an eclectic engineer. I gave up."
5,Mike Boldt's Musical Tribute to John Wayne's The Alamo,Mike Boldt's The Alamo: A musical Tribute to John Wayne's Epic Film is a great piece for any fan of the story of the Alamo and the film which John Wayne did over 40 years ago.I can see much dedication and heart went into this cd by everyone who took part with Mike Boldt to make this great tribute to John Wayne's epic film.
1,"The Alamo, music tribute to John Wayne","The music is terrible, not even close to the sound track music. I think they should take John Wayne's picture off of the cover"
5,speaker adapter,work very well-no mods & allowed easy bolt in for speaker upgrade.saved time from making a pair out of wood.worth the $$$/thanks for the great deal Amazon-alls well in the JUNGLE.
3,"Seem to be well constructed, but didn't fit.",The description doesn't say much. I cross referenced the product number to other websites and found that supposedly this should allow 6.5 inch speakers adapt to a 6.75 inch opening. They do not. They are for 5.25 speakers to adapt to 6.5 inch opening.
5,"A voice of exceptional power, range, and sensitivity","This is a stunning debut album from one of the finest talents in musical theatre today. Mr. Gaines' voice soars through a wide variety of songs, from standards to recent material. His phrasing is impeccable (especially on Sondheim's poignant ""Anyone Can Whistle"") and his vocal rangeis phenomenal. He is currently working on analbum of Sammy Cahn songs. I'll certainly put onmy ""High Button Shoes"" to go ""All the Way"" forthat one!"
5,Spellbinding Aviation/Military Thriller,"Once you start this novel, you will not be able to put it down! Very intriguing plot mixing murder, mystery, aviation, military action, and sex. In addition, there is a keen insight into the Vietnam war, and the limitations placed on our military units by the civilian DOD decision makers. Those readers with aviation and military experience will relate to many of the experiences of the characters in this book. There is also the intrigue of several murders that creates a sinister background throughout the book.A very unique tale of boyhood friendship and betrayal, murder mystery, military action, and aviation thrills. The author has drawn upon his extensive experience in aviation and the military to create a very outstanding book. The thrilling conclusion is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommended!!!!"
2,Draw Me a Star book,"Disappointed in the book...not because of Amazon, but the author...did not feel it was appropriate to show naked bodies of a man and a woman in the book...not necessary at all. Would not recommend this book."
2,Draw Me a Star,"Disappointed w/Eric Carle. This is a wonderful story, but the illustration of the man and the woman are not appropriate for our second grade classroom. This book goes well with a Marilyn Burns math lesson , but we were unhappy with the book's illustration."
5,Celtic Knot Necklace,I enjoy this piece due to its complexity and beauty. The genuine blue sapphire adds charm to its beauty.
1,This item is junk,"There are only a couple of models in these cheap plastic cars, although each comes in several colors. They break during normal handling, and were a total waste of money. The only reason they even got a star at all, was that I had to rate it with something."
1,Lots of the same crappy car...,"I was disapointed in the quality of the cars. They all had the same 2-3 shapes, just different colors. Later, I found a set of Hot Wheels (about 20 of them) for about the same $$. Cursed myself for not looking harder for cars. Does my son play with them? yes. Are they junk? absolutely"
2,not what i thought,The top view shown makes them look like matchbox type cars. But they actually look like cheap cars in person. Wasn't at all what I wanted.
2,Not worth the money,I bought them to use as party favors for a little boys' birthday. They are mostly plastic and several broke within an hour. I would not recommend to anyone.
3,Toy car,They were alright my boys love them but there kinda cheaply made. They look like they could fall apart easily.
1,Die Cast these are NOT!,"These ares are ALL plastic except the cheesey axles that do not fit the cars either. Very disappointed!The description states ""Metal Plastic Die Cast Cars"" I'll be surprised if these last through all of Christmas day with wheels on them."
2,I used this as a potty training incentive....,These are flimsy cars. I would only use as a potty training incentive...nothing else. They are super cheap...super light in weight and not good quality. I would NOT let my son play with these.
4,small toy cars,"Well worth the money I paid. I took these to an orphanage in Eldoret, Kenya for the boys to play with."
1,Not helpful,"I am not sure who wrote the review above, but this book is barely helpful to prepare for Step 3. Chiefly, the questions are NOT in the format of the exam. Many have straight-forward (single-word; not simple) answers and test highly arcane facts for those (not me) that practice Internal Medicine. As I found with Step 2, the only questions that are ANYTHING like the exam are the NMS Series."
1,so far from step 3,"I wish the people who write specific review books have atleast an iota of idea about what the exam is like.At this rate you can as well give the book a title like usmle step 2, or PLAB or any other title cos the book has as much relation to these as to the step 3 exam."
5,A Great Buy,"Comfortable, soft on the skin and just great shorts to wear. I like the color and the feel of hese shorts and the pockets are good as well."
3,"Decent shorts, but pockets not very deep","I bought these shorts for working out at the gym. They are a good length and are fairly lightweight. My one issue with these shorts are the pockets are not very deep, so my iPhone easily falls out when sitting / lying. I also bought some Champion shorts and they have deeper pockets."
5,Comfortable shorts,These shorts are very soft and are not too long like some others. The waistband fits snugly but not tight. Very comfortable and affordable.
2,Poor Cut,I ordered three pair and had to send one back because of poor stitching. All three were poorly cut and stitched and the material is flimsy. I ordered them because someone had given them a good ratingl
2,"$4.99 item, can't believe they worth more","These are very simple, elemental shorts; thin and very loose. I bought this based on the positive review here..I think they are OK if they cost for $4.99, not a dime more. I can't believe I paid $13 a pair for two pairs..I will stick to the Champion brand next time. Do not buy unless it goes below $5 please.Thanks !"
3,Buen producto,"para los que estamos un poco subidos de peso con tallas 44 en adelante la versión XXL de este pantalón para estar en casa es fenomenal, muy suave y buena calidad a un precio justo"
2,not 100%cotton,shorts are o k but was advertised to be 100% cotton and was not.that in turn makes me leary of ordering anymore clothing from amazon.
3,Product no longer as good as it was,"I've bought these in Blue and Black for years. These USED to be great, with deep pockets AND a change/key pocket inside the right pocket. That little pocket is, now, gone AND the pockets are less deep - now, my key and chaps tick routinely spill out when I just sit down..."
5,Great quality Cotton Short,"After reading few reviews and looking at the photos of this Short, still was not sure if this will turn out a decent product. But amazingly it is really a well made (for what you pay) and it's not cheap, long enough for me (I'm 5'7"") up to my knees. All in all I can't be happier and will be ordering another soon."
4,Exactly as described,This product is exactly as it's described. They are very comfortable and wear really well. Wear them all the time and they appear to wash and hold up well to use/cleaning.
5,VG Value,Great quality for the money. Well made comfortable fit. Add this to the Amazon experience and you have a winner!
2,Okay I guess,"I got these based on all the great reviews but I must be missing something. I got a pair of the grey in a small and they were huge! I'm not a big guy but these made me look like I was wearing a kilt. The material was also kind of thin. It's interesting that not all the colors are the exact same kind of short. My first Amazon return. Maybe I'll try another color, someday."
5,just right!,"these shorts are great! as other reviewers said, shorts like these are hard to find, especially with pockets. i have similar shorts, different brand, that i've worn for years around the house and wanted some more to last between laundry loads. thank you, amazon!"
1,Impossible to find men's shorts!,"I guess trying to find an athletic short or gym short is not possible in today's marketplace. I have wasted too much time trying to find a pair of shorts that isn't gangsta/basketball or made with razor sharp thread. The Champion short has a waistband that cuts like a knife. This Soffee short also cuts like a knife but this time the knife thread is in the stitching on the inside of the shorts cuffs. Both are unwearable. The best shorts were the Kohl's Tek Gear but they're no longer available. I think we all have to wait for this wave of cheaply made shorts with fishing line for thread to finally hit the close out bins. Amazon was great, as always for me, in dealing with this issue."
4,"good ""house"" shorts",fabric is a little thicker than a premium cotton t-shirt & the bottom of the shorts hit right above the knee. very comfortable... love the pockets
2,Too Small,"Cons- I have a 36"" inch waist and all of my pants are 36"" inch and size XL was still uncomfortable - particularly in the waistband...Please note: I bought these for sleep shorts and I went up a size to allow for extra comfort at night.Pros- Material seemed durable yet soft (limited time since I quickly returned the shorts).- I would strongly consider re-purchasing these if they came in a size XXL or a more loose fitting waist."
4,good product,This product is as described. Comfortable and fit well. They were worth the price. They were received before scheduled time.
3,Hold your horses!,"Yes it's xmas morning but not everyone rises at the crack of dawn to unwrap presents. But some due check their email and now he knows one of his presents. Please consider this in the future. Karen K.After we had an opportunity to have our Christmas morning, my husband was very happy with these shorts. I had been looking for 100% cotton short for him and had been unable to find any until I discovered the "" Soffe "" shorts. Thank you for the vast variety of goods you carry!"
3,Only one pair,"I purchased these because it was what I was looking for, and because someone else had said that there were three different shorts. This was not the case. The price listed only covers one pair of shorts. Don't think you're getting three pairs at this price, as I was led to believe."
2,Strange design,"Having a 33-34 waist, clothes usually are tapered a bit that I buy. These were incredibly ""blousey"" in the crotch (front) area and that may fit some people, but wasn't even close for me. I know some people love the Soffe products, but this being my 1st and last... Item returned."
4,Good basic athletic shorts,"These shorts are made of a soft, knit, cotton sweat-pants type material. They are comfortable and seem to be fairly durable. They have two side pockets. The main improvement I would like would be that the pockets were deeper. I work out with my iPhone in the pocket, providing sound through headphones. These shorts dump the iPhone out on the mat when I'm exercising on my back. I will have to switch to using a holster for the phone. The inseam is eight inches, putting the hem right on the back of the knees."
4,"Great, comfortable pair of shorts","I needed a pair of cotton shorts for the gym. Cotton, in general, feels more comfortable when working out. This is a very comfortable pair and well-priced. They also have pockets, which can be very useful. The only minor issue is that the material is not firm enough and a bit saggy. Other than that, I would recommend them."
1,Bait and switch...,Soffe Men's pocket shorts NOT sent. Boys shorts sent. No pockets. Hip length. Tiny waist. No explanation offered.
5,Great Shorts,I had been looking for shorts for my boyfriend for several months with no luck. I came across these and thought I would give them a try. They are high quality shorts that wash up well and stay looking great. They are very comfortable as well. I will buy these again.
3,Decent shorts for the price,As with most other shorts in this price range. These do the job and are definitely cheaper than you'll find in department stores. No complaints.
2,"Too thick, warm, long","This was too warm for hard workouts, So I switched to soffe running shorts:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AU5W0A/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_imageOther than that it's pretty standard gym shorts with pockets. It's comfortable in a cold room."
1,Smoked!,"I bought this yesterday, primarily as a reasonably priced drill sharpener, but the capability to sharpen chisels, scissors, etc. was attractive.The drill bit holder was a bit flimsy and the instructions were useless, but with some fiddling I got it to work.After sharpening about 25 smallish drill bits (< 1/4"") the motor stopped. Dead. I took off the grinding wheel to see if something was dragging and found that the motor, never very strong, was dead. Kaput. Todt. Morte. The shaft could not be turned. Seized up like visegrips on a lead pipe. It's going back for a refund, and nothing more from PlasPlugs for me, thanks."
5,Yummy Recipes!!!,I have tried at least half of the recipes in this book and have had excellent results every time. There is a great variety of all different kinds of bread. I highly recommend it!
4,High quality gloves for a great price,"I think I'm done buying gloves at the local soccer shop. I'm a bit of a cheapskate with gloves since they tend to wear out fairly quickly, so I get the $25 Jako brand or whatever. These Adidas gloves are WAY better--the grip is improved, they fit better, etc. Its obviously a much nicer piece of equipment and Amazon apparently has gloves on sale all the time. I'd certainly come back to these."
2,"Will do what it says, not what i wanted","Product is rated for 68-108. i did not see that in the spec when purchasing, and when i got it it wouldn't go colder. I wanted something for regulation around 40F. My bad. Probably need to learn to read. A digital type product, in my humble (Electrical Engineer) opinion, should be able to do a wider range of temperatures."
4,Nice product for the price,"I bought this thermostat to control a strip of flex-watt heat tape, and so far I am satisfied with it's performance. The digital readout is a major plus, especially considering that most thermostats in this price range are analogue. I secured the probe directly to the heating strip and set the temperature to 95F and the temperatures have remained steady around 92F - 95F. The thermostat also gives you the current temperature, which is also very convenient.I've also own two 1000 watt Zilla thermostats, and I prefer the Hydrofarm over the Zilla for two reasons: (1) Hydorfarm's is digital, which makes setting an exact temperature possible, and (2) it displays the current temperature. The probe is also about 10x smaller than Zilla's.I would recommend this product both for its price and the quality."
4,works great!,"We bought this to use in our homeade incubator and it is working like a charm, we had and 89%I hatch rate the first go round and are setting up for the scond hatch this weekend."
3,Mat thermostat,The thermostat was delivered in 4 days and in good shape. I haven't been able to use it because it doesn't work with the mat I purchased. I need to find the mat that is compatible.
2,Radio Interference Problem,"The Thermostat works as advertised. However I experienced one problem: When plugged in the wall, it screws up all the AM radio stations on all our home radios including both car radios while they are in the garage. While my wife listens to her talk shows in the morning I unplug the unit then plug it back in after she is done listening to Glenn Beck. I notified the maker of the problem and hopefully they will investigate it. It just might be a problem unique to my home."
4,Hydrofarm Digital Thermostat,"Overall I'm very satisfied with this thermostat. I use it for a Leopard Gecko heating pad that's glued under the glass bottom of the aquarium. It keeps my selected temp within a few degrees up or down.I like that it has a current temp. readout, and its basically accurate (or agrees with) my digital thermometer.. I can't recommend this if you need a very constant temp as I said before it fluctuates a few *. So it's a fair price for a thermometer/thermostat in one, do hear some clicking when it cycles but not so loud, and not a dealbreaker. Easy set-up. Feels/seems to be well made. Not regretting this purchase at all. (owned approx. 1 month)"
1,Poor Quality,This unit functioned for just enough time to out last the 30 day warranty. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Useless Accessory,"This thermostat was not compatable with the mat that I ordered (contrary to the Amazon coupling of it) and completely of no use to our casual gardening needs. For simply sprouting and inducing healthy, quick growth, the heating mat is sufficient."
5,Works well,I use this to regulate the temp in my hot house. It works well. Really helps in the sprouting process.
4,Must have for heating mats,"I use this product along with a germination station to start seedlings. This thermostat is very sensitive to the temperature, and found that you can have some discrepancies with temperature if placed under aHydrofarm JSV4 4-Foot Jump Start T5 Grow Light System. Make sure to place the probe fully into the dirt. The system is very simple, set the temperature and the thermostat keeps it at the set temperature. Overall, I would buy this digital thermostat again because of the price and simple functionality."
5,Easy to install and program.,This thermostat is easy to install to control multiple heating mats. It is also easy to program to assure uniform temperatures.
1,did not work,I was unable to reset the factory preset temp to a different reading. I called the manufacturer and they had a recording that states they do not speak with consumers. I returned the product to Amazon.
1,Didn't work,"Thermostat didn't work. Propagation mat worked fine, but when plugged into the thermostat the thermostat took the correct temperature readings, but despite having the power light on, and the light stating that it was heating, I watched the temperature drop within a matter of 30 minutes after having the mat heated up before plugging it into the thermostat. Almost makes me think I'd be better off spending $10 on a outlet timer from the hardware store and just having turn on periodically to keep the seedlings warm. The other 1 star review was spot on too."
5,Works great with brew belt,"I purchased this thermostat to use with a Brew belt for fermenting wine. Its easy to set up, plug the heater into the thermostat and set the temperature. The digital display is easy to read. The thermostat was considerably cheaper than specialty ones for brewing."
4,It works but..,"I got this to set the temperature of the heat pad I got my 20 tank for my red tail boa, and I set it at 85 degrees to see if it would reach there. So far, the highest temp is 82 so I have to put a light bulb on that area to make it 87-90 degrees on that side. I have the heat pad on the side of the tank since I have the tank sitting on wood. Maybe I have it set up wrong? the temp gauge thing I have sitting about 2 inches into the tank. Is it supposed to be lower? not too sure. But anyways, it's a good product, i may just be doing it wrong."
5,A must have for any mat,This is a must have if you want great results with germination. I have germinated several plants with just a heating pad with decent results. When I added this to the set up not only did more of my plants germinate but they were much faster to grow. This has happened for the past few germination rounds that I have done and I am in love with this product. If there was one issue it would be that it only has one thermometer. I wish there was a smart heat pad that would heat up sections so there would be grids of heat and not just one uniform grid.
5,Simple to use and great for my leopard gecko,"I bought this because I needed a thermostat to control the heating of my ceramic heater and heat mat to maintain a constant temperature. I plugged a power strip into the single outlet as suggested by the operating manual.Programming was very simple. Just set the temp. When the temperature gets to that point, the heating is turned off. When it drops 2 degrees below that point it turns back on. It is very consistent and I am sure my leopard gecko is happy with more consistent heating as opposed to before where I had to turn equipment on and off manually to try and maintain a constant temperature."
4,Thermostat,Used this with the heat mat that I purchased and it did everything I expected. Will definitel use it again.
5,Love it!!!,"I am very impressed with this! I use it for my leopard gecko and it works awesome. It does shift 1 degree higher sometimes. I have it set to 92 and sometimes it goes to 93. But that is impressive to me! I can relax since I got this and know my little guy is alright. He loves his 92 degree heating pad! Very easy to work, big numbers to read, long cord!"
3,Do not immerse probe into water.,"Seems to work fine for its intended purpose, but I wanted to regulate an aquarium heater. Instructions say ""Do not immerse controller or probe into water.""Also, I inferred from one reviewer that the controller has a ON point 2F lower than the set point. Mine has an ON point 3F below the set point (if I set it at 78F, the heater is turned ON at 75F and turned OFF when the probe reaches 78F). The heating temperature differential (3F) does not seem to be adjustable as it is in more costly controllers (2 x $).I like the LED temperature display and the grounded plug. Other controllers I use have hard-to-read LCDs and 2-wire plugs."
4,Does its job,"I purchased this thermostat to use on my snake rack. I have used it for over 5 months and it has been reliable so far. It's nothing fancy, but it's great for the money."
5,Works Great,Set it up to control a heat mat under one side of our Leopard Gecko enclosure. Does what it is supposed to. Cable for temperature probe is plenty long.
5,Thermostat,Used item for both starting plants and chicken brooder. Works very well. Unit has a 3.5 degree plus/minus variance.
5,Love this thing,"Keeps my seed mat a warm 80-84 degrees pretty constantly. Fast shipping, and it seems extremely well built. It's also extremely simple to use."
4,Works good,"I bought this unit because of price and had a feeling it would not work. I was wrong. We needed another thermostat to control a new heating mat. It has been in use since Feb 1 and has performed well. It is digital and the other unit is analog, 10 years old and still working fine. If this one lasts 3 years I would consider it a success."
3,Do the job but has a narrow temperature range,"This thermostat works as advertised. The only warning I would give to anyone else ordering it is that it can't be set for below 70 degrees F. That IS a great temperature for starting seeds, but I was hoping to use it in the green house this winter under plants to keep the soil temp above 40 or so."
1,Totally Disappointed,"When it arrived I was sorry that I bought it. It looked like COSTUME jewlery. I should have known since it said 10k gold. Obviously I don't ware it now...I went to JCPenny's and bought somthing much nicer and half the price,And it is real gold!!!"
4,interesting book!,it's an interesting book for those who are into paranormal. it has lots of locations and good bits of info.
5,Encyclopedia of haunted places,"Its a good book, and I like the fact that it has statements from other paranormal investigators from that area."
5,09/09/2011,"As a military layman, I found this video to be informative and entertaining. It provided a coherent history of infantry killing technologies over more than 20 centuries. Killing our fellow man/woman is a gruesome business. My heart goes out to those who have had to face these terrible weapons."
5,warfare through the ages,"I caught part of this documentary a while ago, bought the film to finish it off and found it highly informative, enough to recommend it. This is really a well put together series by PBS that covers the evolution of military technology used on the battlefield over the past two millennium. From underground tunnel fights between the French and Germans during WWI, to advanced weaponry being employed by modern day soldiers in Iraq, the film you gives you an appreciation of the feats in engineering and ingenuity conjured up by our forebears & ancestors... sometimes out of necessity, sometimes accidental. Divided into 4 one hour segments, it covers topics ranging from weapons, armor, strategy, fort & castle design with a focus on the breakthroughs and innovations that changed the way in which war is ultimately waged. For those who like this subject, check out Battlefield Series which also originally aired on PBS and is linked through this webpage."
3,For scholars,"This book is HEAVILY annotated! It's very off-putting. I can still read it but the comments written on every page are pretty distracting. Still, it's a book that needs a conversation around it and I can converse with the previous reader!"
3,Not as good as E=mc squared,"Bodanis's prior book ""E=mc squared"" was a more informative and entertaining read than Electric Universe. Electric Universe was a bit too dumbed-down technically in its attempts to be accessible. More detail could have been paid to Maxwell and his wave equations, and ignoring Nikola Tesla's contributions to electromagnetics is a glaring ommission. Bodanis does present though some interesting observations and anecdotes on the personalities and politics of science; scientists may claim the moral high ground with their vetting of each other when they compare themselves to the non-scientific community, but really great scientitsts are often no better than the rest of us, all's fair in love, war, and scientific endeavor."
2,The 'Cliffs Notes' history of electricity,"Purchased this book after seeing that it won the 2006 Aventis General Prize for popular science writing. While the book is a quick and interesting read, I found that it ultimately left me wanting more... much more. The book certainly manages to hit many of the high points in the history of electricity and electronics. Unfortunately, it fails to provide much detail about any single person or idea. The book does include an extensive ""Guide to Further Reading"" and numerous notes for those who like more details. Annoyingly, the notes aren't referenced in the main text so you're forced to read in parallel through the main portion of the book as well as the ""Notes"" chapter if you want the full story.In the end, I suppose my own expectations got the better of me: I was hoping for an in-depth history of electricity, perhaps along the lines of Richard Rhodes Pulitzer Prize-winning ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"", rather than a entertaining afternoon read..."
3,Same book.,"I was so excited to see David Bodanis had what I thought was a NEW book! I already have read this one twice. It was displayed with a new title, or subtitle, new cover and the publish date was more recent. Same book, I should've looked inside! This is a great book, but I was disappointed that there wasn't a new one and I'd bought the same one."
2,unclear writing,"I liked the idea of this book, but the execution left something to be desired. The writing was clunky and not all the dots were connected."
5,Love it !,"We love our Jeanie Rub, but didn't like leaving it lay out on the dresser top. This wall hanger is the perfect solution."
2,Disney Boombox,"We bought this item for our daughters, ages 5 and 6, last year for Christmas and we've had nothing but problems. It worked pretty good for a while but it no longer reads CDs. Unfortunately, the warranty is up and I no longer have the receipt so I can't return it. I've tried to contact the company and they weren't any help. I was told that I should try to clean it and if that doesn't work, I should have it repaired (at my own cost). In my opinion, I would buy another boombox."
1,Very disappointed!,We bought this before my daughter was born because we thought it was cute. It is a year old and no longer will read the CD. I am sad because it was a cute addition to her room. I should have bought one that cost less.
5,a favorite,"Of all the gifts my daughter ever received, the Princess Boom Box (now 4 yrs old) has been the most used and loved. It has survived a multitude of sleepovers, younger siblings and pets (that chewed off the antennae) - yet it still lullabies her to sleep every night. Buying one for my other daughter this Christmas."
3,"So much Money , So not worth it","This may be a cool looking boombox, but do not be fooled by its looks. I recieved this product for Christmas this year . After only 6 days it pucked out when I was trying to play a CD. If I cannot get it fixed I may ask for a refund from Circuit City."
3,Boom Box,"The Boom Box does not appear to be top quality. When you want to play, it takes a while to do so. I'm afraid (from the ratings) that sooner or later it will not work. Alot of money for this piece of equipment."
3,Beginners,"The story of a son, his girlfriend, and his gay dad, oh and his dog. This movie is an independent movie, which I love. I loved movies such as The Kids Are All Right, Kaboom, and Chloe, but I was quite disappointed with this one. I've been wanting to see this one ever since I saw the preview, I thought it look very good and entertaining including the story seemed very original, but in the end, I thought it was just all right. It didn't keep my attention like I hoped it would. I'd have to say the best thing out of the movie was the dog, it gave the audience and I a few chuckles when they put subtitles on screen. In the end, Beginners is certainly not the best movie of the year, but not the worst. It is a movie that will be remembered for a while, but will soon be forgot and played on HBO within the year.[RENT IT]"
2,i thought i was watching pain dry,"what a slow movie, extremely boring and uninteresting. dialogues are dull, characters (with the exception of Plummer) are lifeless and the entire premise of the movie --that the father coming out of a closet impacts the son's love life in a profound way--seemingly sensible, somehow fails to work in the movie and live up to expectations. what a waste of time and money. stopped watching after 45min. sitting through this movie was a torture,to say the least."
2,nothing to be gained from watching this,"Well, this movie was not at all what I expected from the trailer... It's actually a mostly depressing movie... I do not see how people can call this heartwarming. Christopher Plummer plays a likeable gay man, but the movie is from his son's point of view and the son is mostly sad, introspective and so is his girlfriend. They have a laugh now and then, but a small laugh - overall, there's really no reason to watch this movie unless you're in the mood for sad and lonely. You will not feel better about anything, least of all about the time you just wasted watching this."
1,Uplifting comedy?,"The box described this as an ""uplifting comedy about how funny and transformative life can be"". BS! It's unfunny and depressing as hell!"
4,Movie,"Good movie, came in on time. very thing was nice. A movie which I was expected.I shall order more in the future."
2,A huge disappointment,"I've long been a fan of Christopher Plummer and the description of this movie sounded very compelling - and I was intrigued by the semi-autobiographical aspect - so I was really looking forward to seeing it. Unfortunately it was one of the most tedious movies I've ever seen. I kept waiting for the storyline to pick up, to no avail. Frankly, I was relieved when it came to an end."
2,"No Sex, No Car Chase! You Call This a Movie?","""Beginners"" struck me as more of a case study than an actual movie. But if you don't like a movie that has received critical acclaim, you should probably assess your mood. Did you have a bad day? Did you get a good night's sleep? I may have been a little sleepy: I drifted off several times and had to replay a number of scenes. But was this sleep deprivation or was this just a dull movie? I have a hunch the enthusiasm for ""Beginners"" will fade with time and it will turn up on Netflix with a rating of 2 and a half stars."
1,Slow To Start-(and slow to Finish),"This movie was VERY slow to start. Normally I would not have continued watching it, but it got such high ratings that I figured there must be more to come. There was not. It just moved excruciatingly slow the entire time. You would think that a movie with so many major twists would be entertaining, but they managed to make it boring. That is a pretty big achievement."
1,What was the point?,"Really, that was the big deal.I have to say, this is simply a pointless, dark view of life, love and human relationships.This is what a bad over rated movie looks like in 2012.Watch something else....Let me share a quote from my wife,""this movies sucks."""
1,even ewan & christopher can't save it,the script is so bad. it's totally self-indulgent of the director/writer and a complete BORE. it makes ALL artists come off as extremely self-absorbed as the writer who lived this story is.
1,ugh,"AWFUL movie, had to turn it off, what a waste of money!LOVE Christopher Plummer, I'll stick with The Sound of Music"
1,SLOW AND VERY BORING- 0 STARS,"Slow and pointless with about 4 or 5 continuous flash backs all embedded in each other,one to Ewan's early childhood, one to the gay father, one to the father's death one after the death and qwll...who cares! Additionally there are visual gimmicks employed (like showing a whole bunch of coins in a coin collection when the size of a coin is mentioned, left me saying ...what?. I just got done spending 45 minutes with this thing. On my list of the most boring movies ever. hated it, I am not the only one saying this the people who watched it with me made exactly the same claim. If you are drawn into this type of film watch Rabbit Hole, a master piece.Rabbit Hole"
1,Cloying Clean Oh So Cute Hipster Fare,"Wow this movie is in love with itself. Too bad that the unoriginal Williamsburg Silverlake sheen hangs over every inch of the frame like a heart sucking cloud. Like watching a Ryan Mcginley Levi's commercial that is trying to take on the profundity of cancer, homosexuality, love, family... Throw in a little French New Wave and some Spike Jonze and Miranda July and you have... Vomit"
3,Dull,"I first took notice of this film because I adore Ewan McGregor, and I found the premise intriguing.I read pretty bad reviews on here, so I passed on renting it.A few months later, I questioned whether the negative thoughts were simply too harsh and I'd be part of the few who enjoyed it.Welp, I wasn't.You've got these great actors and yet they're not given anything to do.The pace of the film is slow and unsatisfying.My interest only peaked when McGregor and Plummer were on the screen.The point of Melanie Laurent's character--I do not know. I hated her and McGregor's character together. I rolled my eyes every time she came on the screen. They made a relationship look utterly boring.I agree that the character of Andy was miscast and...I don't know what that was.Unless you're really curious, I say skip this one."
5,Great story,"Great and eye opening story on how you can live the life you really want, starting at any age! It's never too late to be who you really are and who you want to be."
5,Wonderful,Such a lovely movie. Very thoughtfully crafted and the acting was flawless - what I would call a modern classic.
2,"Sweet, but not funny or entertaining.","Just rented this DVD. I was expecting it to be funny but it's not really a comedy. It's more of a study on the turns of events in the lives of these particular characters. That's fine, but there's nothing funny or entertaining here.The film doesn't follow a coherent story line, either. It's really just a collection of scenes. And for some reason I can't fathom, it makes gratuitous jibes at George W. Bush. What he has to do with any of this is never really explained.Overall, its an okay film, but if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have rented it."
3,Just okay,"Because of recommendations from friends, I think perhaps I expected too much from this movie. It wasn't a bad movie, but it was not a movie that I would spend time watching again or recommending to others."
2,It Was Just Okay,"This was a story I was quite interested in, but upon execution, I found the film lacking. I thought that Goran Visnjic was horrendously miscast and misused as the younger partner of Christopher Plummer's character.Christopher Pluumer inhabited his role deftly and ably, while Ewan McGregor did his best in his, but the whole thing came up lacking and felt like an art house movie and not in a good way."
3,This is a film about emotions,"A sweet and touching film, ""Beginners"" tells the story of Oliver Fields (Ewan MacGregor), a man in his late 30s who learns that his recently widowed 75 year-old father (Christopher Plummer) has terminal cancer--and is gay. The movie focuses on Oliver's attempts to understand these revelations as he navigates a new relationship with a complicated French actress Anna (Mélanie Laurent) and an even more complicated Jack Russell terrier named Arthur, whom Oliver inherits after his father's death and who refuses to leave Oliver's side. Ultimately, this becomes a film about opportunities for love that we seize and that we squander and the myriad lingering effects of our responses to these opportunities. ""Beginners"" is a small film with a big heart and a profound understanding of emotions."
2,Boring,"I know there's some sort of deep meaning in this film, but I did not find it very entertaining, except for Arthur, the dog. Him, I liked. I found the film to be boring and almost turned it off before the end, but I persevered. I wish I had watched something else."
2,A Bit Slow,"It didn't keep my attention like I hoped it would. I'd have to say the best thing out of the movie was the dog, it gave the audience and I a few chuckles when they put subtitles on screen. In the end, Beginners is certainly not the best movie of the year, but not the worst. It is a movie that will be remembered for a while, but will soon be forgot and played on HBO within the year."
2,Not very interesting,This movie moved slow and the best parts were about the father. Not a very good movie overall. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
2,"Borrow from the library, don't spend your own money","One or two of the essays are interesting; the others are either fuzzy attempts at deep thinking (""We need new paradigms! Bartender! New paradigms all 'round!"") or spend too much time touting whatever it is the authors have that they want advertised. Inconsistent (in both level and quality), but with some buried nuggets"
2,"Although content is good and timely, the print quality is illegible","I got this book to prepare a syllabus on design aspects of software engineering for an undergraduate course in computer science. Despite being more than ten years old, in terms of content, the book is fit for the purpose. Indeed, the authors of this edited volume provide several design perspectives (e.g., graphic design, architecture) on software. So far so good, but how is the reader supposed to read through pages with illegible fonts? The problem is not one of style, but of print quality, which looks like a photocopy from originals made with a dot matrix printer from the 80's."
2,Ehhhh..... A collection of stale essays.,"I had to buy this book for a class; if you're interested in a historical perspective on instructional technology, you might find this interesting. I didn't."
1,Oh how disappointing,"Having lived in Italy for over 20 yers I am a great fan of Tim Parks. Italian Neighbors, are my neighbors. Down to the barking dog you plan to kill on the first moonless night. Italian Eucation is the story of my beach and my beach club. Down to the juke box mother! Adultery is just such a disappointment. None of the humor. None of laughing outloud. Just dull and overly trying too hard to impress. I have to say I disliked every word of this book. Not vintage Parks"
3,"Interesting but too breezy, blithe","The English have a tradition of great essayists but modern practitioners such as Parks and Theroux do not have the scope or weight of their predecessors.Parks is clever and he never rambles on. But his subjects--adultery, cleaning his daughter's room, the transforming power of language expressed in a hike--do not carry the weight of an Eliot or Orwell essay. Maybe that's because most of Parks's pieces appeared in the New Yorker, which has pared back noticeably the length of essays it publishes.You may find that the essays do not compell repeated readings as, say, Eliot's and Orwell's do."
5,READ IT,"All the joys of being a husband, friend and father are extolled in this book, yet they are rendered with a much deeper understanding of the human condition and the community of life."
4,Talented young guitarist delivers a solid first cd.,"Keep an eye on this kid. An excellent guitarist who will definitely be a household name in a few years. The music is primarily 50's style blues-jump blues. The supporting band is excellent as well...check out ""Everybody Wants Her"" and you'll see why this is a special talent."
5,A Gem,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best spiritual books I've ever read. It is well written and although written a number of years ago now, is as relevant today as when it was written. Its message of living in, appreciating and discerning the presence of God in the present is as good as anything I've read by others, including Tolle and Dyer. If you are going through a difficult time, I suggest that this book could be a lifesaver.I purchased the book on Amazon several years ago on the strong recommendation of a trusted friend. I read the first chapter almost immediately, but I just finished the book this morning. It is amazing.If you're on a spiritual journey, this book can help chart that path. And again, if you are having a tough time, this book is likely to be particularly helpful.I cannot recommend it more highly."
4,Useful handouts.,"I have used almost every section effectively to teach ACT prep. Very useful, I hope they make a sequel!"
4,it fits,"well, it's just a plastic box that you insert into your dashboard if you have to mount a different stereo. We had to make some adjustments for it to fit my Toyota Yaris'07, but it works. There is no way anyone can pull your radio out without taking the whole dashboard apart now..."
2,Not one of Brewer's better efforts,"Cop leaves the force in tumultous circumstances, gets involved with the death of a teenager/juvenile delinquent. Quickly becomea a ""man on the run"" sort of thing. Painfully contrived and painfully obvious -- if you've read any books of this sort at all, you'll guess every twist and turn of it. Main love interest is annoying as heck and mystery villain is laughably obvious -- again to anyone who's read more than one book of this sort. There is one great sequence in here -- the protagonist is nearly beaten to death by a mob of juvenile delinquents -- but it's not enough to save it."
5,Love it!,"I got this bag today and it already has proven more than useful. It's got so many handy pockets and places to hide things, like the side pocket that can fit half my hand (I had to test the size), or my cell phone, perfectly! My favourite part is the headphone jack in the front of the bag, so I can plug my mp3 player into my car without having to take it out of the bag. The whole thing is built great, and the cushioned back makes it even better since it's so comfortable."
3,No Big Deal,"Barely enough room for laptop. spare battery and power supplythe cell phone pocket on the ouside does not close wellif you need something lightweight then this might do, but otherwise.....seek something roomier"
4,Heavy,"Bag is durable and good looking but is very heavy...If you have a 15 or 17 inch laptop you can hardly carry it for 100 yards...If you are a well build and workout frequently, you will like it or else try others.."
3,Good but not great,"Stylish laptop messenger bag and also comes with a pouch for the laptop power adapter. It will be nice if it had an extra side pocket for laptop power adapter instead of putting it in the front pouch which makes the bag bulky. Otherwise very durable and can hold documents, cd's, pens, etc."
4,Useful,Great looking bag. Only thing that I don't care much for is the separate (detachable) mesh like pouch bag that's used to store the power adapter...
2,Low quality sound,"The flat panel speakers have plenty of power, but the subwoofer is sub-par. The overall sound quality is not at good as most speaker systems I have tested or the speakers I already had. The promotional price makes it an attractive choice if low price is your top concern, but you can get better sounding speakers for the list price."
4,No bad for the price.,"Granted, these may not be the best sounding speakers on the market, ...They sound best when played at low to medium volume, a little tinny, but overall very pleasing. The added bonuses here are the space saving design and high tech look. I use these in my office and everyone who comes in comments on how well they do sound. I don't beleive you can find a better sounding system in this price range."
1,Pass on these and spend a few more $$$ on better,The design and style is what attracted my eye in the beginning. They look great with my Dell Dimension 8200. Looks are all that these come with. The sound is awful and vibrates. There is no headphone hook up on these and my cheapy speakers that these replaces sound much better. I am actually on Amazon to buy new ones. Wish me luck!
3,It's the Gay Taort...,"What can I say except its a ""Gay Tarot"". I enjoyed this deck, and had some laughs, but it needs to be brought into our current time. The cards go from commical to fantasy,(check out the guy in outer space) again dont't get me wrong the Gay Tarot is certainly unique if your gay and reading for gay men at a cocktail party. Now about Lo Scarabeo, the Best, probably why I didnt Trash the quality of these cards. The paper stock and finish are Great, If your a gay man or a collector buy this deck I highly reccomend it.dop"
3,A different point of view...,If you are use to a standard Tarot deck then you probably won't like this. This deck gives a completely different point of view on reading. The images are not overly sexual (and thats a good thing) but when you look at it you can tell this is ment to be used by men FOR men. The deck definately has masculine overtones and is not something women can overlook.
2,Doesn't charge my phone very fast or at all some times,This charger takes so long to charge my phone. The regular AC one works fine but I can't seem to get this one to work for my phone. Palm 700p. Although it may be something I haven't figured out yet so I'd look at all the reviews before deciding to buy. If you see the same theme you know its not just a bad one but a flaw in design.
2,Dated but still useful,"Having just rescued a standard poodle who is fearful of being groomed I thought I would learn to do it myself rather than leave her to the ministrations of strangers who may make her fears even worse. This book is dated (my copy was published in 1965) and the language and tone reflect that but it is still a useful resource. I really like that the book is spiral bound - makes it easy to refer to it as I'm working. The photos are good and the instructions are clear. This is not a book to get if you want to learn about poodles, or have a poodle that has any issues with being groomed - it is simply an instruction book for clipping and grooming - nothing more. The author is very specific about which products she recommends and, again because of the age of the book, many of these products are no longer available. I would not recommend this book to a person who wants to learn to clip their dog for shows, but it's fine for the pet owner."
2,Okay for beginners,It seems the book is from the 60's and came from a library.It's a simple book with a lot of black and white illustrations but I would not recommend it for those who want want to know more detailed grooming.
4,"Be Quiet, Marina!","I am a ECSE teacher and plan on reading this book next fall to my students. This will be a great book to open up discussion about so many things such as friendships, how to work out differences with your classmates, how everyone is different (including children that are differently abled) and that it's ok if you don't get along with your classmates ALL the time, you just have to be able to work things out and treat people the way you want to be treated.This book would be great to share with ANY Elementary classroom. It has great photographs, big, bold print and easy to read text."
5,Ditto,"Literally anything I write here about Gabe Suarez will be a duplicate of my evaluation of literally any of his books and training.Just like I said about all his other books and training, he's the best of the best. His tactical training through his books exceeds the grand scale of others I have read."
4,Great Read,Great Read. Easy to understand and the pictures help. I wish someone would come out with a book for us left handed shooters!
3,Solid piece of work,"Having lived tactical shooting as a core part of my life this is a good starting point and guide for some of the core concepts associated with tactical shooting. I would say this is a decent book #1 for anyone getting started with tactical shooting.I strongly disagree with the author on his disparaging and limited coverage of non-sight, ""push"" shooting. This is a technic that is critical to learn and practical in many tactical shooting scenarios.The book has a fairly law enforcement oriented take on tactical shooting and limits itself in that sense. Not a complete treatise or coverage on tactical shooting.Good basics book. Kudos to the author for a solid work."
5,Tactical Pistol Marksmanship: How to Improve Your Combat Shooting Skills,"Very easy to read. Book is filled with good information for veterans and beginners. It has detailed pictures of the concepts with explanations. This is the first book I've read by this author. I'm familiar with the author's past, but found this book very helpful being a firearms instructor myself. This book cannot replace actual training, but is good reference guide to keep up with skills learned through training. The book offers practice drills to improve skills. Overall, I'm very pleased with this book."
3,A basic textbook,"This is the first book I read for Mr Suarez, I respect his views and techniques especially that he studied under the legendry Jeff cooper, this is a basic textbook, a correct one, it is the kind of training you receive the first time you handle a pistol as a policeman or military. I come from a special operation background and frankly we receive in the first 15 days of pistol training information and techniques that bypass any textbook I've read until now and I read a lot of them, which seems normal. One very advanced and real secret Mr Suarez revealed in this book is the dry practice, pass one day with delta force operators anywhere in the world, and what they do when relaxing,dry practice with their 45's, trust me I know what I am talking about."
2,Very Basic Overview,"If you know very little its a decent starting point. I mean theres one thing he goes over about trigger reset that if you follow it youre never going to develop any real speed on follow up shots. Oh and its printed on good quality paper.Bottom line, tries to cover too much without any real details, and there was never any ""Oh wow, never thought about it like that"" moments."
1,illiterate and incompetent...,"Like other reviewers have pointed out, Gabe likes to fashion himself an original thinking, maverick, outsider gun writer. He often insults other instructors or schools of thought to make himself look better. He's completely over the top and mainly just takes advantage of mall ninjas who buy the ""terrorist interdiction bags"" he sells (note: his glock 18 mags went up in price to $50 the day after they were used in the AZ shooting--his store says, ""buy them now before politicians ban them!""...anyone who uses tragedy to profit is a lowlife with no class. Like the other reviewer said, Gabe is a ""weak man with poor self esteem, and an inflated ego. I can not honestly recommend this book."""
1,Average advice devalued by massive ego,"I've read this book and taken classes by Mr. Suarez. He gives good, very basic, information. But he has a real problem dealing with critcism and his ego gets in the way quite often. This is especially true when he speaks about ""mindset"" and how he depends upon degrading and insulting other instructors and authors in order to build himself up. That is the sign of a weak man with poor self esteem, and an inflated ego. I can not honestly reccomend this book."
3,Not Representative of Gabe's Other Work,"Tactical Pistol Marksmanship was surprisingly disappointing, not because the information was bad, or because it was poorly written, but because compared to Gabe's other books, all of which I've read, it was slim on new content.If this is the only book on the Tactical Pistol you get or read, you will likely learn a lot, but you will learn much more if you get Gabe's other book by that name, or his book The Tactical Advantage,or almost anything else he's written.If this was the only thing I'd ever read by Gabe, I might have given it a 4 out of 5. Compared to Gabe's other work though (all of which I would rate at 5), this one was disappointing."
1,It Should Be Noted That...,"Since Mr. Suarez is no longer a police officer since being convicted and sentenced to prison for insurance fraud, what he has to say should be taken with a healthy grain of salt. Much, if not all of what he includes in his books and seminars is rehashed material liberally ""borrowed"" from other established instructors and trainers, and while being investigated for his crimes it was duly noted that at least half of his ""street-shootings"" involved stray dogs, not armed and dangerous felons.Bottom line: A person with such a track record can hardly be considered suitable for obtaining such important information from. Yes, Mr. Suarez has served his time and is once again a free man, but I for one do not consort nor do business with known felons. The information in ANY of his ""literature"" can be found elsewhere, usually from whence he obtained the information to begin with, and most of the times written far better and of course from a reputable source."
1,Not What I Was Expecting,I was looking for a book to improve my shooting and I did not think this really helped. Full of anacdotes and little war stories. Not what I was after at all. My focus is on ISSF (or bullseye) shooting and this book is about police style use of firearms.
5,Rox The House,"The gal's got more streetcred than Posh Spice & Brad Pitt put together. This song is so confidently written & pperformed you would not believe it was a 17yr old performing. Makes Britney positively puerile & has a killer chorus & video that the likes of Madonna & Janet Jackson would even envy. A well-deserved UK No1 (her 3rd, hence paralleling her with Britney) & having just bought her new album today, Billie Piper shall be respected!"
5,"video, lyrics, picts?","The tracks are great and all, but I just can't see the video & others no matter what I do! Something to think about before buying this single if you're buying it just for the video."
4,Wizard of Oz Magnetic Playset,"A nice, basic magnetic set. Makes a good introduction to the Wizard of OZ for young kids. What I like best is it lets them use their imagination, something not too many toys do these days. Also a must have for any Wizard of Oz collector. NOTE: This is a 10 Piece set, NOT 5 as a previous reviewer stated. If you're going to review something, at least get your facts straight."
3,My Grandaughter loves what's left of it.,Some of the figures are armelss or legless but my 3 1/2 year old grand daughter still loves to put them on the card and the fridge. I thought the figures would be more sturdy but they're just a heavy cardboard and with shipping it's a little pricey for what you get.
1,wizard of oz play set,I was very disappointed in this item. Although it is titledWizard of Oz magnetic play set once I recieved item it says on cover not a toy. It is not durable and wouldn't last if it were played with. I bought this thinking it was a play set and it was a gift for my granddaughter
4,It is more of a collectible than a toy. Would have made a better playset if the characters had been smaller,Nice addition to Wizard of Oz collection. Characters are large for the metalized mat that came with it. More of a collectible than a toy.
4,fun toy if you are a fan,"If you love Oz, then you'll have fun with this magnet set. Even better if you have a creative imagination.Only problem...a 2 year old wants to keep taking them on and off the refrigerator so after a while they got worn out and bent, and eventually they start to break....I'd still highly recommend it, I'm sure they would last forever if they didn't have 2 x 2 year olds playing with them constantly."
5,Totally Awesome BOOK!!!!!!,"This is a must have for all Cammy lover's. It is wonderfully illustrated and gives gorgeuos Cammy the credit she deserves, this is the best of spy action thrillers there is so I highly suggest you get this book!!!! The story is rich and you can't put it down till your done(me anyway). This book is great!!!"
5,Must Read for Teens and Young Adults,"What a find! The author tells a true personal story about his climb to success after very difficult and troublesome teenage years by accepting his problems, prioritizing his life's goals, listening to his loved ones, believing in himself and never giving up! Its down to earth, fun and easy to read. Every teenager and young adult should read! The book can help troubled teens and struggling young adults cope with difficult situations and know that with goal setting, hard work and determination, one can recover from any hardship and acheive personal success."
4,Nobody Says No,"D&B meets Lounge-Downtempo with a little future Jazz thrown in for spice... a few of the tracks are a little ""heavy,"" uninspired and repetitious which might be fine if you're 19 and rolling, but the rest keep a nice groove and provide the escape you seek."
5,ops I listen it again,"I can just say ""this is awesome compilation"". solid. groove. get it now. thanx."
4,Fine performance: so-so sound,"Multi-channel SACD is a substantial advance over two channel stereo. Two channel SACD is a god-send those who love old remastered late 50's stereo CD released by RCA. However, modern recordings that pose as SACD and are only two channel are a disappointment. Unless very well recorded the sound is not much different from standard stereo, so what's the point? This effort falls into this category. It's a spirited performance of two wonderful ""big name"" chamber works. But when wait for that rich full SACD sound out comes the two channel. Not bad, mind you, but it could have been so much better."
3,Fine playing but CD sound,"Nothing wrong with the fine playing but:1. This is not a surround SACD, but just stereo.2. The SACD layer is not better than the CD layer.3. This is a rather close miked recording with much stray sounds from the trio.4. This is a live recording, and apparently there was a flu virus going round, because there are a few nasty and insistent coughers."
1,SM-BB8S doesn't protect and customer service is worse,"I purchased a SM-BB8S after a lighting strike took out my modem, thinking I was now protected. On Dec9th we had a power disruption and energy surplus which the SM-BB8s did not stop. This resulted in over $600.00 damage to my computer and monitor. What makes this worse is Recoton/Acoustic Research/Thomson Inc. have lagged in the customer service dept. I've made 7 phone calls to the 1-800 number and sent one fax as required in 6 weeks and have NO reply other then ""we're sory sir, but the claim is now in the Thomson legal dept."" (they will not give out any information as how to contact the legal dept either). No one has ever called me back, no one has ever gave me more information, and every dead line as to when I will recieve a call or answer to my warrenty claim has passed.Find a company who backs their product up with a real warrenty, and who doesn't play games with thier customer service. This company doesn't deserve your money."
3,In response to T. Kanchanapinyokul of Burbank...,"Okay. To answer your question: you're wrong. Cheaper is usually NOT better and, in the case of surge protection, it almost NEVER is (but something tells me you knew that, right?) While this product is, well, okay -- for the price -- do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks for something more reliable (like Belkin's SurgeMaster, for example). Of course, you could really lay out some cash on a decent back-up/protection unit (think a couple hundred) but, at forty or fifty bucks, the Belkin should do fine."
5,Outstanding,"What an outstanding story! So many interesting statistics about the Flyboys. Of course, it was horrifying to learn of how many of these brave men were treated and how they were dishonored in death."
2,Descriptive documentary on torture,"I have always been fascinated by history. However, this book is totally grossing me out and I don't think it's necessary. All I need to know is that there were lots of beheadings and lots of rape and even some cannibalism involved. That would have been enough to fill one page, not a whole book. There's not much about the relationships between the fly boys except that they didn't talk about their commrades who went down or were captured. It had my attention throught the first half of the book and now I've been saturated with enough. I'm 3/4 of the way through it and just hit a spot that was so gross that I'm not going to finish it."
2,Bias comes through,"As a former student at military war colleges, I agree with all of the well written reviews that see the book as biased against the United States. There is no way Japanese historical atrocities can be excused away by American history, period. The book should have been focused on Chichi Jima as Flags of Our Fathers was on Iwo Jima, but is cluttered by the author's yet unseen agenda. Regardless, it is a heart-wrenching story of warfare and it's ugliness."
1,Stuck on stupid,This book is good only for throwing across the room. Why this is so has already been explained by most one-star reviewers. I will stay away from anything written by James Bradley for as long as I live.
3,A little too sympathetic,"He seems to give the Japanese a pass on their conduct during the war. Given the scale and the brutality of their behavior, I absolutley do not think they deserve it."
5,Liberal America bashing at it's finest!,"It's all here! The US expansion westward was really ""racial cleansing"". Teddy Roosevelt was a monster. The US is a violent and greedy lot that is responsible for terrible war crimes. Just look at what we did in WWII! And by the way the Japanese were mean sometimes too. Michael Moore step aside - Mr. Bradley is here!If you're the kind of person who thinks America is to blame for 9/11 then I urge you to buy this book immediately!(However, if you have half a brain or more then I suggest you find a historically accurate book on the WWII Pacific campaign. There's lots of good ones out there.)"
2,Please don't re-write history,"An interesting story. If we could just remove the attempt to re-write history, it would be better. This author seems to think that the US started the war with Japan."
1,A Disappointment,"I received the book as a gift. Had I had a chance to browse through it beforehand as a potential buyer, I would not have purchased it. The book jacket claims this is a story of the Navy fliers who were executed and eaten at Chichi Jima in WWII, as well as subsequent legal proceedings. It doesn't mention the truly awful revisionist history and moral equivalency vis a vis Japan and The U.S. espoused by the author, and which makes up the bulk of the book. For example, p. 67 ""The four presidents depicted on Mount Rushmore had all supported the ethnic cleansing of the Indian."""
2,Biased,"I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys. Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly. As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as ""Curtis."" As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies. This was very distracting. I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book. The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful. Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics. Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF. This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman."
5,Flyboys,"Excellent book with details not published on the POWs. Had the US known these details 50 years ago, Things would be very different today"
4,heroism and horror,Man's inhumanity to man is shown alongside stories of individual courage. Time allows is to see what really happened and acknowledge that war brings out the gamut of human behavior. A valuable fascinating story of WWII.
3,Agree with many others,"I think this book could have been much better and more historically appealing. Too much Japanese bashing in the first 150 or so pages. This is not the topic nor the theme. Anyone who knows anything at all about WWII would already be aware of what the Japanese did to people. Maybe this approach was a ploy to get the readers excited about the Flyboys doing their job and getting even. If so, this was a bad ploy. Perhaps Mr. Bradley should have intereviewed more people to get some better prime source material to validate the book's title."
4,others don't get it,"The other reviewers who condemn this book share in the same mis-aligned, narrow thinking that Bradley aptly describes in his narrative book.After finishing it this evening, I felt a sense of true balance here - refreshing perspective on a hideous event in our nations history. He sets the stage well in the first few chapters (as the idiot reviewer below suggests was 'misleading'), and walks you through an intense and personal account of what really happened in the Pacific theater. Remember folks, there are three sides to every story....their side, your side and the truth. I think Bradley does well at nailing the latter."
2,Basically the human race is on the level of animals,"I picked it up hooked by the idea that 9 pilots went out, only 1 came back and he wound up president. To set up what happens later the author goes into great detail over the horrible things the Japanese did in China then to balance it off the horrible things the USA did, the French did, etc. Basically any one and any country with any power will abuse it's weaker neighbors. The stronger people will rape, torture and kill without guilt. You get the feeling the author has contempt for himself and everyone around him. You think the universe would be better served if we were to kill ourselves off."
1,Hypocrits,"This is just another book that americans like to brag about how their ""brave"" grandfathers were treated poorly by japanese soilders in WW2. Get over it, people. If it wasn't for the jewish men's atom bomb, i'm sure americans lost the war in south pacific, just like they did in vietnam.Btw, What about the Americans dropping two A-bombs and nearly wiped out innocent population in japan? What about all the american G.I's and civilian crimes against native folks in Japan, Korea and south east asian countries that never get reported in major american media? How come there isn't a single book about ugly americans living in oversea?"
4,Good book about the Pacific Theater,"Not as good as Flags of Our Fathers, but a very good book that shines a light on a little-known, little thought of corner of WWII."
3,Needs More Citations,"Overall, I thought this was a good book. I found the history of Japanese imperialism and the justification for American imperialism interesting, although both stories were full of generalizations. I suppose Mr. Bradley would need an entire textbook to thoroughly cover these subjects. One of the major flaws of the book was the lack of citations to go with some of the quotes - The reader is never told who said some of these things. This could lead someone to think that they were made up by the author. The book is gruesome in its details of Japanese treatment of POW's, but probably historically accurate. This is not a book for the squeamish."
3,The Sophmore Jinx,"I won't write a long essay like a lot of the previous reviewers....suffice it to say I really enjoyed Flags of our Fathers (I would have rated that a 5 out of 5) and was looking forward to another wonderful book when I opened Flyboys. Very disappointing....Both sides were guilty of some pretty horrible atrocities during this war - however, I got tired of the repetition of hearing the same stories in graphic detail over and over and over again."
1,MORE OF THE SAME--,"I spent a lot of time with military aviation and Naval aviation in particular and really don't understand where the author got the notion ""Flyboys"" is a term of general usages. The excessive usage of the term becomes a real distraction, much like a current teenagers neverending and excessive use of the word ""like."" The opening chapters are disorienting and distracting. If he wannts to write a treatise on US military and political misdeeds he should do so. To mix it upp with a narrow and focused story as he has done is a dis-serviice to all."
2,Sad disregard of the planes they flew,"Bradley effectively documents Japanese atrocities, but shows virtually no understanding of the planes his ""Flyboys"" lived and died in. Corsairs, Helldivers, Avengers, Mitchells, and so on played vital roles in their crews' existence, each with its own combination of strengths and weaknesses. Bradley's aseptic descriptions of air combat fail to evoke these dynamic, visceral marriages of man and machine.Ironically, SBD Dauntless dive bombers appearing in the beautiful photographs on the jacket and flyleaves are identified nowhere in the text and were apparently flown by none of the main characters in this book. The Dauntless dominated most of the crucial Pacific naval battles with its unique combination of range, maneuverability, and toughness, but was being supplanted by the faster (but clumsier and less forgiving) Helldiver by the time Chichi Jima was attacked.Far better treatments of the Pacific air war exist."
2,It could have been a good book,"It could have been a good book if Bradley had kept to the story of the nine American flyers, but he spends far too much time blaming Americans for fire bombing cities and strafing civilians. Bradley leads the reader to believe that the Japanese turned murderous and savage only after American's landed on their islands in the 1800's. He gives little/no background on their conflicts before that. They were cutting off the noses and notching the ears of Koreans long before Perry showed up. Save your money, don't buy this book. It's nothing more than P.C., blame America first pap. It's just too bad, this could have been a good book if Bradley stuck to the Flyboys.DB"
1,It's all our fault...,"I spent $6 on this book and wasted my money. I'm having a hard time choking down even the first part of the book, it is so anti-american. With a title that calls the Fly Boys american heroes, I feel like I've been snookered, that the title was a ruse to get people to buy the book. I'm going to try to get my money back.Let me ask you: What does the Mexican-American war have to do with World War II and the subject matter of this book? Does it even merit mentioning? It does, if your intent is to twist the reader's beliefs about who we were and are, and who are enemies in World War II were. In typical, modern anti-american style, the root of all problems in the world was,is, and shall always be: Amerika.Unless you've got a pressing need to know what happened at Chichijima, or really need another reason to hate your fellow americans and your country, don't bother with this book."
4,I was one of those flyboys.,"The events of 18 February 1945 bring back sad memories for me. I participated in the strike on Chichi Jima as a combat air crewman on a TBM Avenger piloted By Ens Jack Keinath with turret gunner Ed Nowak. I saw the plane of Ens Hall and his crew heading for a water landing due to antiaircraft damage. I transmitted a mayday in hopes that a submarine rescue could be made. Only after reading Flyboys did I learn the ultimate fate of Ens Hall, Mershon arm3/c,and Frazier aom/2/c. The news was very distressing to say the least. I found the book very accurate and informative."
3,The Pacific War from a Bleeding Heart,"James Bradley follows up ""Flags of Our Fathers"" with ""Flyboys"", an account of the Pacific campaign of WWII, expressly from the airside of the war. The account of the actual war and the fate of the ""Flyboys"" is interesting and sobering. However, Bradley seemed to lump America and Japan in the same category when it comes to war attrocities, implying that Japan learned aggression from America. While we are less-than-perfect as a country, our general practice of taking the moral high ground sets us apart from Japan. The most interesting part of the book to me was the prophetlike predictions from Billy Mitchell as to the impact of air forces in the next (WWII) war."
1,Huge disappointment,"When I saw this book at the store I eagerly bought it becuase I had enjoyed the author's previous work Flags of Our Fathers so much. What a terrible dissappointment this new book is. The PC revisionist history, lecturing tone and moral equivocation at its worst made me put this book down after having only read a quarter of it. I haven't returned a book for a refund in many years, and I'm happy my bookseller would take it back.The reviews below pretty well describe the spit in the eye this book is to our efforts in WWII so I won't elaborate. Perhaps Bradley was emboldened by the success of his first book (which had a co-writer) and felt he could now lecture us all on how terrible our country is. I wonder if the many vets he interviewed knew he was going to write a book like this, or whether he simply duped them. It's fortunate that most Pacific vets of WWII, including my father, are not around anymore to read this thing."
2,Skewed History,"Flyboys is skewed. Bradley starts with a non-objective, skewed view of war history (Japanese and American), collects and interprets facts to support his skewed view, and then writes a skewed book. This book is a disappointing lecture by a non-historian who proves he has no credentials or impartiality as an historian."
3,Great!!,It was a very interesting book I enjoyed it. It was a little hard to follow in audio form I don't know if it's abridgment or that is way it was written but still worth it.2 of the 5 discs skipped at the last 5min of the CD but it wasn't anything I couldn't live with.
5,Why America Dropped the Bombs,"I am old enough to have lived through the war and remember it well. I never knew why Japan declared war on the U.S., even though I have taken every history class offered throughout my school career. ""Flyboys"" is probably the most brutal book I have ever read, almost too difficult in places. I am grateful to James Bradley for having written this book, I now understand why America dropped the Atomic Bombs and put an end to that war. ""Flyboys"" is a must read."
5,Thought Provoking,"One of the most thought provoking books I've read in years. The poor reviews come from people who want to kill the messenger, i.e. Bradley."
4,Great perspective!,"I rally enjoyed this audio book for several reasons, first it was not a traditional broad view of a battle or event, rather it essentially traded the lives of several young men from before Pearl Harbor to the islands of the Pacific and their fates. In doing so it lent a very human perspective to war and made me better appreciate what my father's generation had to endure to secure our freedoms. It also spoke to the horrors of war, how Japan at the time was much like a cult, and how ordinary boys on both sides fought died, and some survived. It was about ordinary boys, with maybe 3 sentences on George HW Bush that provides a linkage to other histories that I've read or listened to. In short I learned a lot, it kept my attention, and came away with a better perspective on parts of the war in the pacific I barely knew anything about. A good purchase that I recommend."
5,History,A good history book but very excitingA good book if you like historyBut a good book if you like action
3,Found writer's attempt to balance history strained,"Having read hundreds of books relating to the war in the Pacific and many books about the treatment of POWs by the Japanese I felt the book lost focus when Bradley hauled in all of this data on our treatment of natives in the Phillipines etc... Obviously many U.S. troops have committed heinous acts but that wasn't the topic of the book. A more interesting book might have focused on why the U.S. navy did nothing about these camps, why more commando operations weren't used to rescue these poor men, and why the U.S. government didn't declassify all of this information sooner?"
1,Not Worth the time or money,"I was very disapointed in this book and regret spending the time & money purchasing it. Read other reviews for more details if you like, but I wouldn't spend the time. There are numerous other books written much better that provides more insight that Flyboys. Interestingly enough, the author notes comments from the autobiography of US Grant and The Rape of Naking which are both more interesting books than Flyboys. And quite frankly, I felt insulted after reading this poorly written piece of the author's view of history. Sorry if I offend anyone, but I just didn't like it."
2,PC At Its Worst,"I cannot lay before you line after line of why this book will let the true reader of WWII history ""down"". Suffice it to say after living in Japan for many years, learning the Japanese and knowing our countries involvement in War, You will not get the ""true"" history of the lead up to WWII but a PC correct version of history that is insulting to all of us who have served in our military. The story of the true heroes should have made up the bulk of this book but did not. Don't waste your time reading it."
3,Relentless,"Bradley overuses the word ""flyboy""- at least 1 million times. It reminds me of the Dizzy Gillespie song ""Salt Peanuts"". You go along for the ride, and there it is ""Salt Peanuts. Salt Peanuts."" You go along with Bradley and there it is ""Flyboy. Flyboy."" How about ""Pilot"" or ""Aviator""? It's distracting. I can only imagine Bradley must have won a round of rock/paper/scissors with his editor to be able to include it as many times as he did. Other than that, a compelling gut-wrenching read."
5,Drawn between two worlds,"Being Half Japanese and Half American, this book was by far the most compelling I have ever read. I did not know the extent of anguish and fierce country loyalty that both the United States Flyboys and Japanese soldiers had to deal with. I could not put this book down. I was reading as if I was that person or this person in the book and trying to comprehend what they were thinking when doing what ""had"" to be done. And truly the only book in which the last three words written brought hard warming shivers down my spine and goose bumps up and down my body. And once that was done, I cried."
4,"Good read but heavy on the ""PC""","The author has tells a story that has needed telling for 50 years; the gruesome and barbaric treatment of American POWs at the hands of the Japanese Army, upto and including butchering them alive and eating them. I'll never be able to eat Sukiaki again. This sterling work is flawed only because of Bradly's heavy handed attempt to provide some sort of politically correct contex for the enemy's behavior."
5,Great book - sad story,This was a sad story - but a story the needed to be told. It really made me understand the War in the Pacific a lot better - despite the fact that I've been studying World War II for the past 25 years.
2,I almost didn't finish it.,My greatest problem with this book was it's appearence of blaming America for the woes of Japan and excusing excesses in time of war. The author gave me the impression that he was more willing to forgive Japanese excesses in battle while condeming America for it's methods to end the war. I grant the author's expertise in the access to a personal source for the battle of Iwo Jima near by but I cannot accept his rationalization of Japanese atrocities as a cost of war then condem the Americans for their bombing the enemy homeland (fire and nuclear) to destroy their will and ability to wage war. Overall the book is well written and provides an insight to the mentality of the Japanese military during the war.
2,Not recommended,"I was excited to begin reading this book at first, but was confused with the first six chapters as they had nothing to do with the story I was supposed to be reading. When I finally finished the book I was left with the sense that the author was not so much telling the story of the men on Chichi Jima, but was trying to justifying the actions of the Japaniese by writing ""shame on you"" history about the destructive American air raids during the war. Overall, although some parts of this book were interesting the majority was not."
1,Did Bradley actually write ALL of this book?,"Other reviewers have pointed out the numerous factual errors in this account, as well as the fact that the central story of the downed airmen is a minor part of the tale. It seemed to me that there also is more than one writing style on display here. The ""back story"" and the ""Flyboys"" section appear to have been written by different people. I have to wonder if Bradley's editors at Little, Brown, didn't ""bookend"" the rather thin Chichi Jima story produce a 338 page book, and added more than a dollop of political correctness in the process."
2,American bashings ruins good air war history,"Don't buy this book or Bradley might write another one!Bradley spends an incredible amount of this book bashing America, the Indian, Filipino, Japanese civilian killers. Between the bashing he does a decent job of describing America's air war history.I almost threw this book away by the time I got a couple of chapters into it. I persisted despite his continued trashing of America. Bradley's point seems to be that firebombing Japan was immoral despite the fact that the Japs killed 30 million enemy soldiers, women, children and noncombatants."
2,"Definitely Interesting, but nothing new","Like other reviewers, there are far too many attempts at moral equivalency in an attempt to excuse the Japanese behavior. It does seem as an American-bashing book, odd because the author is the son of a marine who earned the Navy Cross at Iwo Jima. Probably a good thing he wrote this after his father's passing. Last the book seems like an attempt to be as unnecessarily graphic as possible. I am not squeemish, but the extensive, detailed and long-winded accounts of barbarism seems gratuitous, especially in light of the fact that he tends to attempt to excuse these behaviors. There are far better books out there if you want a feel for naval aviation in WW2. And there's very little information in here on former President Bush as well. Flags of Our Fathers, the authors previous & first book, was a tremendous book - Flyboys, well, it's interesting."
1,Flyboys,"I had a difficult time with this book. Having ready ""Flags of Our Fathers"", I had hopes this would be as well written and informitive. However, from early on this book came across as just another piece of ""pagan liberal propoganda"". The ethnic cleansing of American Indians by the United States was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there.The pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the United States does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions. This book is another pagan apologetic for what's wrong with the US and right with all nations who wish us ill."
4,Real Eye Opener,"For me this book answered quite a few questions. My father was a B-29 pilot during 1945, but did not talk a great deal about his experiences. Now I feel that I better understand part of what he must have gone through. The atrocities (on both sides) and the insight into the minds of both the Japanese and the Americans at the time. When I was younger I found, in a box of my father's, a Japanese wallet with pictures, Yen notes & momentos. My father told me that they belonged to a Japanese soldier that he shot when the soldier tried to surrender on Guam. Until I read this book I never could understand how my father could have shot an unarmed man. Now I not only understand but, more than likely, would have done the same thing myself. On one hand FLYBOYS is a disturbing look at history and, on the other hand, an excellent reminder of the psychology of war. Well worth reading."
5,"A well-told tale of heroes, monsters, and the horror of war","This is an exceptionally moving true story of American kids transformed into American heroes. It is a tale of innocence and of adventure of the highest order on behalf of a great cause. It is also a sometimes hard to listen to account of the utterly gruesome acts people are capable of when their enemy is dehumanized. It is truly an excellent book that puts a lump in the reader's throat and leaves it there.I'm reviewing the abridged audio recording, and my only reservation is that the reader, who is also author, is a better writer than performer. Nothing new about that, but that's a small quibble here."
4,Very Interesting,"I think this is one of the better books written on WWII. Especially for the Pacific Theater. Yes, it's honest about horrors commited by both sides - before, durring and after WWII. So it's not for those who wish to believe that the enemies of the USA were the only ones to commit horrible war crimes. I'm glad that the author has included input from people who were actually there. Both Japanese and American. The history of Japan presented in this book is interesting and explains well the state of mind of Japan's government of WWII. I'm sad to hear of how those on Chichi Jima died, but I'm glad to finally have found out. Great read."
3,Bradley's Contempt for American Military,"The first 78 pages of Flyboy badly trashed Americans with tales of White European people murdering and torturing Indians, Mexicans, Blacks, Phillipinos in their march through history. Nothing about crimes the other side committed against Americans that caused some retaliation and revenge. Bradley seems hell-bent on bad-mouthing America and it's military throughout the book. Bradley ""deliberately"" used the term FLYBOY, a derisive term to Air Force people, throughout the book because he wanted to denigrate and stab the airmen in the back at the same time he writes about their ordeals. He hates America and the military and believes Japan learned their evil ways from America's past. I saw the same hate in the show ""The Pacific"" on HBO. Bradley wants the whole world to know that American soldiers committ atrocities, which is unnecessary."
4,First-person interviews enhance WWII history,"Mr. Bradley has written an excellent history of the Aviation war against Japan in WWII. His interviews with Japanese soldiers and American aviators enlighten us about their experiences during combat. Mr. Bradley presents a picture of the culture of Japan that was an important part of the reasons for Japan's involvement in the war. William Manchester wrote in ""Goodby Darkness"" about the savagery of the battles between Japan's imperial Marines and the American Marines on the occupied islands. After reading ""Flyboys"", I have a much better understanding of why this happened."
4,Deft Handling of a Heartbreaking Story,"Bradley treads carefully with this heartbreaking story, never sliding into melodramatic horror at the terrible fates of his subjects nor vilifying their Japanese captors. With diligent research and an even reporting style, he brings to light a tragedy so serious that the military still refuses to release the service files of the men involved to their families these many decades later.The author reads the audio version of this book, and some of his inflections and pronunciations are distracting. It was also a little difficult to keep the various flyboys straight. Although their backgrounds are given, the story is told from a reporter's perspective which creates distance between the reader and the boys.I learned a great deal I hadn't known about the bombing of Tokyo, the emperor Hirohito and former President Bush. This is well worth reading, though I suggest having something very positive to read afterwards because this one will you sad."
4,Awesome history lesson.,Great book. First one third was a great US history lesson. The rest of the book did an excellent job of letting us get to know the main characters. Makes me appreciate the sacrifices that have been made for the country I live in.
4,Informative Read,"At first I thought this book was primarily about ""Flyboys"", American Pilots in the Pacific during WWII. Well I was wrong but I am still glad I read the book.The author mixes both Japanese and American history in this book. It seems he is constantly trying to one up each nation's war time atrocities. This gets stale at times.I did enjoy learning more about the Japanese mindset that lead up to the war and during it. I knew that they committed atrocities in China and elsewhere but to read actual accounts of what they did was eye opening.I feel the author did his research and the stories of the pilots were compelling. However, I feel like the book could have been better if he stuck to the pilots themselves."
2,is a book not a CD,"This was clearly displayed as ""(audio CD)"" but when I got it, it was a used, hardback book. Haven't read it yet - my husband will only listen to books so I don't know if it'll ever get read."
2,Bradley no repeat,"While Flags of Our Fathers was outstanding, Flyboys misses the mark in all categories. Bradley's research is questionable because there are so many factual errors. Sadly his liberal, bleeding heart bias pours out as he whines about America's treatment of Native Americans in the 19th century.SAVE YOUR MONEY! Flyboys is a STINKER!!!!!"
1,Couldn't get past page 90,"The disturbing images of Japanese conduct and inhumanity during WWII made me sick and I DID put this book down. By page 90, I had had enough."
1,"Bad book, full of opinions and errors","This guy is obviously a peacenik who regards both sides in a war as equally guilty of crimes. He would probably regard Hitler to be morally equivalent to Churchill or Roosevelt. He clearly has no military experience and copies experiences from other sources.An example of his many glaring errors: in chapter 12he refers to the, ""flight deck ... was an incredibly dangerous place"" with, ""volatile jet fuel that could burst into flames..."" Funny, he never mentions the WWII jet planes in use on Navy ships. Aviation fuel is extremely volatile while jet fuel is basically kerosene and not nearly as volatile. I further find the term ""Flyboys"" as annoying and condecending to these flyers who were men."
2,Self-flagellation disguised as a war story,"Mr. Bradley spends most of the first quarter of the book establishing how guilty and atrocity-committing Americans have always been...just to make the coming atrocities of the Japanese more palatable. It's hard to imagine a stranger book: it sells itself as a history of our brave naval aviators in the Pacific War but loses way with its Liberal Guilt - and one-sided - description of the wars with Native Americans and Filipinos. Mr. Bradley seems to have missed the atrocities committed against us during those conflicts (he should look up ""Moros"" and ""Samar"") while he details the bloodlust of the Yankee invaders.This was a disappointing read - but excellent propaganda."
1,Throw it Back....,"I never got to the ""Fly Boys"" part of the book about the true courage of WWII fliers in the Pacific who paid the ultimate price. The first 100 pages of supposed historical prelude turned out to be nothing more than an overt rejection of Western culture in general and Christianity in particular, intertwined with a coarsely written characterization and single sided judgment of American progress and greatness. In a time when it has become fashionable to stick our country in the eye, this is a crassly opportunistic book that primarily underwrites author Bradley's twisted version of world history at the expense of American heroes. If you feel compelled to read this unscholarly account of the Fly Boys, cut out chapters 1-6 first. Given that suspect lead in, what follows may or may not be all true."
3,"Great Story, Odd Revisionism","Bradley hit a grand slam home run with ""Flags of Our Fathers"" but with ""Flyboys"" he ran a triple into a double. Reviewer Starzec does a fine job of detailing and addressing some of the odd commentary and analysis by Mr. Bradley that marginally taints an otherwise great book so I will not go into detail here. Bradley's writing style engages and flows easily and takes the reader on an emotional course right to the end of the book. This is a heretofore little known story but certainly an important one. This is one for the personal bookshelf. Good read.Steven Bustin, Author: Humble Heroes, How The USS Nashville CL43 Fought WWIIHumble Heroes: How the USS Nashville Fought WWII"
2,Hidden Agenda - Misleading Title,"After reading, ""Flag of Our Fathers"", I became wary of the author's apologist leanings. I did not purchase ""Flyboys"", and upon reading it after receiving it as a gift, was glad I had not spent the money. The book does deal with courageous ""flyboys"", but it also spends a lot of time contextualizing the viciousness of the Japanese during WWII. First, I didn't want to read about how justified the Japanese were in their treatment of our POW's. I wanted to read a book about our fliers in the Pacific theater. Second, I don't buy into the apologist's theory and believe that its advancement is particularly dangerous and counterproductive in today's war environment. Extrapolating the logic of the book, the terrorists can certainly be excused for killing western civilians, which is exactly the position of the peoples and nations that harbor our enemy today. Buying this book patronizes the enemy of this country."
4,History vs. storytelling,"Author Bradley is a storyteller and a detective, not an historian. He needs some leeway to establish a context, which is tough to do with such a complicated subject matter. Reviewers should save their historical-critical energies to refute the analyses of real historians.Technically, the writing is unsophisticated and sometimes inept. There are painful mixed metaphors, an annoying third-person use of the Japanese honorific ""san"" (and then only when the author approves of the subject), and the unscholarly, disparaging references to those who displease the author(bordering on name-calling).Once you get by this trivia, you see the book for what it is: a mesmerizing, disturbing, intimate story about the exteme dichotomies of war. As with the tale of Breaker Morant or Judgement at Nuremburg, a reader can take any ideology he wants from this ""sideshow of the war"", but in the end can not help but be haunted, saddened, and inspired."
1,US Bashing at its Highest.,"I actually couldn't get past the first three chapters because of the over-the-top characterization of the US being a totalitarian expansionistic culture. And the Japanese culture being far superior to not just the US but to every culture at the time. That is until the US showed up on their shores. And because of that encounter, led the Japanese to their own expansionistic ways ruining their society. I was actually skipping paragraphs to get to the actual meat of the book but I gave up in frustration. If you want a good blame the USA book, this is it. I guess I'll never know the real story behind the book. I plan on returning it today."
1,Disappointed,"Bradley lost me in the first few pages of chapter two. This is a book purporting to be historically accurate, and yet Bradley repeats the same old revisionist view of 19th century America. He then goes on, in great detail, to attempt to paint the U.S. and Imperial Japan as both being pretty much morally bankrupt. Give me a break. As I recall this guy admitted in Flags he believed the Japanese had been given a bad rap by history regarding WWII. In that book, despite his evident feelings, he was able to tell the story in a factual way. Evidently, in telling a story that isn't about his father, all bets are off about the nasty old U.S. of A. He should have stopped with Flags. The story Bradley set out to tell in Flyboys deserved to be told. Unfortunately, James Bradley is not the one to tell it. I'd pass on this one, and I won't be spending any more money buying books by this author."
3,Emphasis Off Track,I agree with other reviews that Bradley strayed too far from the story in trying to give us a synopsis of what led up to and surrounded WWII in the Pacific. Students of military history would have prefered more attention to the Chichi Jima trials that followed the war's end than to Billy Mitchell's past.
1,21st Century Authors,"What a catastrophic disappointment from Bradley. Why is it that so many 21st century authors feel it necessary to bash America? I just happened by this book at my local library and after reading the cover, decided it would be a good read. WRONG. After just four chapters, I'm done and will not waste another minute reading how America is/has been so evil. I came out to Amazon to read the reviews - which I wish I'd done in the first place - and agree 100% with all the one star reviews."
2,"Gripping subject, wrong author","James Bradley's irritating writing style is the least of the many problems with this effort. Essentially he's taken an engrossing subject suitable for a lengthy magazine article and turned it into a pretentious, self-indulgent tome. Even the title trivializes the severity of the subject.Anybody remotely familiar with aviation realizes that Bradley is unsuited for the topic. He places jets in the US Navy in 1944, talks about ""runways"" on aircraft carriers, and even manages to morph the B-25 Mitchell into the ""Billy"" bomber. When his approach is not ignorant it's just plain silly.Readers have to wonder: if he talked to so many aviators in researching the book, and got so much of it wrong, what's lacking in the core areas of Japanese atrocities?He deserves credit for persistence in tracking the story, but in an ultra PC effort to appear objective, he insults every ""flyboy"" who helped rid the world of the Japanese empire."
5,Powerful Story of Good and Evil,"""Flyboys"" grabbed me immediately, I stayed up all night to finish it. I ordered a second one for my adult son, then a third one for a friend. ""Flyboys"" really is a must read! It provides objective historical facts yet is heartbreaking, heart pounding and heartwarming; a very powerful story that reveals the worst and the best of humankind in the face of unspeakable evil."
4,Good Read,"Its a good book, it tell a lot of history about American pilots in that time, but the the story of the pilots who were on chi-chi Jima acounts for about a third of the book. It is a good book there is just a lot of set up before getting into the meat of the story."
5,A GUT WRENCHING TALE WELL TOLD,"This is a great story about the place and development of air power by the U.S. in WW II. More specifically, it is about individual pilots, a little of their personal history andd their aircraft training and then a lot of information about the Japances during the war, their attitudes, and practices concerning their troops and officers. The information is most interesting and brutal plus unsettling at times. The devastation we wrought to Japan is incredible and all because of the airplane. If you are a history buff, aviation buff, WW II or whatever you will elnjoy this book."
1,Scriptures from the World of the Politically Correct,"There should be a warning on this book that it was written by a religous fanatic. In this case it is the Church of the Politically Correct (is there a more dogmatic or intolerant church?).The first five chapters have nothing to do with WW2 but instead lays the basis for the atrocities of WW2 as being a consequence of the way white, Christian men treated the American Indian. (While the Church of the PC does not belive in evil, they do believe that something very close to it comes from white, Christian men.)By chapter 6, the story picks up a bit except for the continuous moral equivalence of ""we were really bad too"".For true believers, this book is essential dogma. For the rest of us, it is a task of seperating fact from scripture"
1,The Worst Thing EVER!,"It's not even worthy of 1 star.... this person is a hack. Not to mention they have no imagination, creativeness, or talent. Do not support this junk!"
3,Pretty solid southern rock,"Okay, of course he's cashing in on his family-name (Jimmy's a cousin of the late Ronnie) and, yes, this sounds a bit like a poor man's Lynyrd Skynyrd. But anyone who likes Molly Hatchet or Skynyrd (old OR new) won't be dissapointed with this one. It contains solid, competent southern rock, which is al too rare in this day and age. Apart from that: Jimmy really seems to believe in this type of music and really loves playing it."
4,Not bad..,"I really dont know whether or not to consider this classic techno or not. The thing i dont like about this cd is there is only 1 mix of Trip II The Moon on here. This cd would have been worth it alone for the Trip II the moon mixes. Unfortunatly i have to find the remixes seperately. Other then that this cd isnt too bad. I dont think its the best stuff ever but if you have the cash, and its available then i'd get it."
5,Excellent resource for Dena'ina studies,"This is the collected writings of Peter Kalifornsky, a Dena'ina Athabascan elder who, in order to write the book, first had to study and help create the written version of the Dena'ina language, and then went about writing down all the stories of his cultural language of Dena'ina. Peter wrote the stories in Dena'ina first, and then translated the stories into English. The Dena'ina translation appears on the left pages and the English translation on the right pages. It covers the full spectrum of cosmology of the Dena'ina culture. A great resource for anyone interested in understanding about one of the most successful subsistence cultures ever on Earth."
5,Outstanding publication,"This book contains some very useful information and ""how to's"" on researching and creating/re-creating Native American beading projects.The illustrations are first rate and it is well written.A ""must have"" for someone that is considering delving into the world of Native American beading."
4,I recommend the library first...,"When possible, I take a book out of the library before I buy it. Hey, 3-6 weeks of free review, can't beat that. Anyway, I would recommend getting this book, but at a discounted price (from here or another online source). If you are like me and do beading as a craft, I personally I found some of the photos and diagrams quite helpful, but some of the instructions and other diagrams were a little hard to follow. If nothing else, you can get design ideas from it! I would rate parts of the text as moderately helpful, depending on your interest level."
3,"Nice, but worth it?","My two year old has fallen in love with Maisy. I searched on-line for a plush Maisy toy he could cuddle with. This was the only one I could find at the time, and it came with a book - bonus! It comes in a nice boxed package and the book was cute, but shorter than other Maisy books...about 4 pages. Also, the Maisy doll was much smaller than I had imagined, about the size of a ""beanie baby"" but stiff and not cuddly. It might be great for a child who collects Maisy items and wants to display the small doll, however, if they want to cuddle a soft Maisy friend, this is not the doll to do it."
3,Disappointingly small,"Both the doll and the book seem a little small somehow, but the book is pretty cute. As much as my daughter is a Maisy fan, she really showed no interest in the doll."
1,Weak Light,"It looks good, but the light is not bright at all. If you are seeking a flash light with a bright bulb, this is not it."
4,GREAT FLAsHLIGHT,"Hummer flahlight is a good-looking flahlight. I feel really comfortable with it and i could carry virtually anywhere, my backpack, BIG pocket, etc. Charging the flashlight is a good, health thing. Beleive it or not, when you shake the flahlight to recharge it, you feel some pain in your arm. It feels though as if you are excercising. As for the light,at first, it is REALLY BRIGHT. After 30 seconds, the flashlight starts to weaken but it is still good enough to see. This is why i gave 4 out of 5 stars. They should add a better, long lasting battery.OVERALL, this is a great flahlight!"
2,handy but hard to use,"I've installed about 500 ties with this gun and it has its good and bad points. The good: it's is a nice size and light weight. The bad: it has been quite difficult for me to get it to grasp the ties without causing the tie-end to get trapped in the gun, often stopping the tensioning process. The groove through which the tie end passes before exiting the rear of the gun has flat ""steps"" in it for some reason unknown to me. It's on these steps that the tie end hangs and then begins to curl up and jamb the gun. Needless to say, I'll be looking for a better tensioning gun!"
2,Bloody average,"Added this to my wishlist based on the reviews here and got 2 bottles as a gift.Pros:Gets you smoothIs easy to rinse outJust a little squeeze gives you a lot of foam once you rub it in, much more than aerosol foamCon:Considerable bleeding. I have used a Merkur DE razor handle, Derby Extra blades, and Colgate aloe shave cream for years, with little to no bleeding. On my first try with the HeadSlick, I just did my facial hair with a new blade and ended up with lots of nicks, bleeding. Waited until it regrew to about the same length (today) and I decided to do a split test: scalp got shaved with the HeadSlick, facial hair got shaved with the Colgate, same handle and another new blade. Same result; my HeadSlicked scalp got lots of nicks and bleeding, my Colgate aloe'd face predictably only had a nick just outside the corner of my lip. I have pictures of my scalp and face (before I wiped off the dried blood and remaining cream) for comparison."
4,like it,arrived on time and ha been usefulit is very efficient and gives me a good shave each time i use it
3,Decent Product,"I really like the fact that this is in a bottle like this... It is much easier to take into the shower than a regular rust-prone can of shaving cream, squirt some out, and shave away. However, I am not a fan of the 'mentholated' aspect. I really wish they'd make other scents and versions of the headslick... but all in all provides a good shave.That said, I prefer using it with a regular razor over the head blade - simply because I hate the head blade."
4,Good and slippery. Menthol aroma,"Not too much foam created. Leave skin very silky and good smaell, like a soft menthol. Good for shave the head"
4,Smooth sailing,"I've used HeadSlick only 2 or 3 times, but it's been clean shaving so far. A little bit goes a long way. The HeadBlade cruises nicely over the scalp, as advertised. The shave is definitely closer than I previously achieved with a conventional razor and shaving cream/gel."
4,Insightful!,"The word crash strikes fear into any investor's heart. Fear not, writes scientist Didier Sornette, who has crunched the numbers (not to mention the probabilities and log periodicities) and has determined that crashes are, in fact, quite normal and predictable. If prices are soaring and everyone you know says profits are guaranteed, get ready. Sornette backs up his argument with countless charts, formulas and phrases such as ""spontaneous symmetry-breaking regime."" Still, there's enough plain English here to enlighten the lay reader. We suggest this book to traders and investors looking for a unique analysis of market crashes."
3,Bring your college economics professor along.,"WOW! What I thought would be an indepth examination of markets and how and why they fluctuate was...but that's the simplistic version of it. This is, by far, the most complex and detailed account of stock market behavior I think in existence. Whether that's good or bad is entirely up to the individual reader to decide.It is heavy on the mathmatical end of it, so bringing along your left brain with this book is a must. I found it too confusing in trying to make the formulas fit with what the text was trying to tell me. In short, I got so lost I had to reread several points, which detracted from the overall experience of learning. It's excrutiatingly detailed, to say the least. This isn't a bad thing, but definitely not my preference.If you are highly skilled with formulas or have a LOT of time to kill reading a book, I recommend this. Otherwise...just drop your econ professor an email."
4,Does the job,"I've been using this in private security at night for about 6 months now so I carry a mag-lite around for about 4 hours total per shift. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it bounces around. It's nothing major, but I've heard leather holsters do a bit better in stabilizing them. Other than that it hasn't broken and I don't have to carry around the light in my hand or pocket so I'm satisfied with it."
3,So-so.,"If you don't do any climbing or anything very active while using it, I guess it's okay. I would recommend something with a better grip on your flashlight. It's more suited to a police night stick than other tools."
3,If you don't mind the pain...,"My primary reason for purchasing this string was to have it last longer. That it is doing I've had it on now for about 6 weeks. Typically, my strings break every 2-3 weeks playing twice a week. I like the control I have with this string. Seems I could hit out more and keep it in. Can't execute the ""cute"" shots as well however. The string seems to go ""dead"" after about 3 weeks. The biggest negative is the poly mains are so stiff I now have tendinitis in my elbow. Undecided if I'll continue using this string. If I do, I would drop the tension about 10% on the mains and keep the crosses the same as before (55 lbs)."
1,Repulsive smell,I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting. I had to purchase a different case.
3,My thoughts,"I sold this item twice , I t was given to me as a gift on two seperate birthdays , now I have a different case , but durring the time Iused it It worked fine , I gave it a low rating cause it doe nothing else , it is what it is, Plus thier are better options out thier than this one."
2,This case stinks!,"The material of this case exhibits a very strong smell. I own this case for two weeks and it still smells bad. Unfortunately, you don't notice this while it's in the wrapping. Have it unwrapped for you and check it out before you buy it."
1,Zipper Universal Case is Better,The universal case that zips and opens flap up is better and it looks more professional. The case inlcudes 2 velcro pieces to velcro to the inside of the case. It's padded and much easier to open and use considering we were only given to hands and we have write with one of them. With the mail in rebate we got the case free when we bought the Zire.
2,The Mysterious Case of Zire,"As someone else recommended, I had the case removed from the package at my local Staples store, and yes, there was a very strong odor of a mysterious scent. It was unlike any plastic or rubbery substance I had ever smelled before. My wife was with me and she did not know of the strange reputation this Zire Case has. She smelled the odor right off and exclaimed, ""What the heck is that smell?"" We went to Office Max and the scent of the Zire Case there was not as strong, but still detectable. By this time however, my wife did not approve of purchasing one of these and I was inclined to agree with her. It is too bad, because the case has a very nice fit and is different from anything anyone else is selling. My recommendation is to wait and see what else becomes available for the Zire."
1,The smell is one thing but the size...,"As others did, I had the package opened in the store. I noticed a smell that was indeed weird but I would not say the case stunk. Anyhow, there seem to be more or less smelly cases around. One thing though really surprised me: I put my Zire in the case (withouth the original flap!). It fit perfect, too perfect. I could hardly get my Zire back out. Maybe it was just bad luck and it happened to be a badly sized case but I certainly would not pay any money for it. Rather buy one of those Palm leather wallets that have velcro patches inside. Those work perfect."
1,A sad case,"The comment from freedom4u is no exaggeration. The fit is extremely tight, esp. when you first put the Zire in the case. My Zire developed ""creaks"" after going in and out of this case a few times--when I pressed the power button or grasped the Zire to plug in the hot-sync cable, the plastic case would give a bit in various spots--there was no longer a solid feel to it. I ended up getting a replacement Zire.A much better solution is a simple zippered case. If you don't like the idea of putting velcro patches on the Zire itself (I don't), just wrap it in an optical cleaning cloth to keep it from getting scratched from hitting against the zipper."
4,Nice Case,"This case is very nice. It does have a ""smell"" to it at first but it fades with time. I like the size & shape & can't see haveing the palm/zire without the case."
1,Needs editor,"The book is riddled with grammar and puncuation errors.The possesive ""its"" is misused throughout the whole book. I stopped counting at 27 times. (i.e. It's a cold day BUT its paws are cold).Possessive apostrophe used with other nouns when the noun is simple plural (see page 51...docs say)Misuse of word ""allowed"" for ""aloud"" ""their"" for ""there"" to name a few more errors.Run on sentences abound.Who could concentrate on the story with errors that would make an English teacher's hair curl?"
3,ABC Blocks Are Fun At First,"My 18 month old daughter loved the jumble of books that came out of the box. After this novelty wore off, we looked inside the books. Each book has a medicore color drawing of about four pictures each. This novelty wore off quickly too. I will note, however, that my five year old has been building tunnels with them!"
1,Falling apart after 3 weeks,"My 15 month old received this item for Christmas, and they are already falling apart. The seam between the cover and first page rips and the books fall apart. She plays with the books, but she is not rough with them."
3,"Cool idea, but not very sturdy","Although the colors and illustrations on these blocks are fun, the cardboard itself doesn't hold up well to a teething baby. My one year old chewed one of the blocks, exposing the brown cardboard underneath, within minutes the first time she played with these. They just aren't as durable as some of her other board books. I've put them away for now; just until she is less orally fixated."
5,Great book set and teaching tool!,"We were given this set of books as a gift for our son when he was a little over 1 yr old. He's 3 now and still loves them. He started out just chewing on them or stacking them. But soon he was lining them up in order. Then we started spelling small words with them and he caught on fast. He's three and reading now and still loves these books as stacking toys, reading material or as letter blocks. They are tough and have lasted through lots of use. We have had to tape a few back together because no board book survives that much love (clear packing tape works best). But I can take the maintenance given what he's gotten out of them. This is a great gift!"
2,ABC BLOCK BOOKS,The books are just the right size for my 9 month old but she wants to chew them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone whose baby likes to chew books. The books don't hold up. I also found the box they come in combersome for storing. I do like the images. I had to put these away for a later time.
2,"Nice books, but they completely fall apart","I really enjoyed the product for a month or so with my 20 month old daughter, but soon after they began to fall apart, first the ""pages"" tore away from the cover, and then even the pages themselves fell apart. I'd stick with more traditional books or blocks."
4,makes a nice presentation,"I purchased this when it first came out. Overall, it is a good value. The box containing the 26 chunky, little boardbooks is very colorful and sturdy. It looks great on a toy/bookshelf. However, I was not as impressed with the color and illustrations used in the books. I would never have purchased these particular books at a bookstore if they were sold separately. I have a feeling that my son will end up stacking these books more than he will open them to read."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book for my 18 month old. Good things I can say about this book: It must taste good because he likes to nibble on the cardboard books. The box it comes in is great, another container to fill and carry. Not so good things about this book: The pages are hard for his little hands to turn, sticking together most of the time. The illustrations and colors are somewhat drab and dull. If you're looking for a toy I might recommend it - but not as a book."
5,PERFECT GIFT FOR LITTLE TYKES,"I OPENED THE BOX AND WAS AMAZED AT THE COLORFUL CARRIER FOR THE FANTASTIC BOOKS INSIDE. THE COLORS ARE BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL, THE CHARACTERS ARE CUTE, THE SIZE OF THE BOOKS ARE JUST RIGHT FOR LITTLE HANDS, AND THE LETTERS ARE PERFECT FOR SOUNDING OUT THE PICTURES SHOWN INSIDE. I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 19 MO. OLD GRANDDAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER REACTION AND DO THE BOOKS WITH HER, READIND AND STACKING THEM AND KNOCKING THEM DOWN. THE ONLY PROBLEM WILL BE KEEPING HER 4 YR OLD BROTHER FROM CLAIMING THEM FOR HIMSELF! I READ SOME OF THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS THAT WERE A BIT NEGATIVE SOMETIMES BUT I SAY GO FOR THIS 5 STAR ITEM...I'D GIVE IT A 10 STAR RATING IF I COULD!"
3,Disney Tinkerbell Pixie Dust Sheet Set,"My Daughter loves them. They are not as soft as I'd like, they need to be a higher thread count to be more comfortable. I found the same set cheaper at my local store. Amazon had quick shipping, and I have never had any problems with accuracy."
1,Shipping Time OUTRAGEOUS,Shipping in One to Two MONTHS for delivery is crazy. I guess I'll just find a seller that can delivery immediately. This is one customer that will NEVER shop on Amazon again.
4,Pixie Dust is a must!,"Ordered this for my 8/9 yr old , she loves it! Need to wash the sheets before use, very hard, not the greatest quality but they are very cute and get the job done. I would purchase again if I needed to. Just as the picture shows!"
3,disappointed with the package purchase,"I was diappointed with the combination of items with the package. I ordered a Full size Pixie Dust comforter ( which is adorable) and this package of items (sheets, pillow) was available at a good price as a package. I went ahead and ordered the package and was disappointed that the sheets that were delivered were twin size (why twin size when you order a full size comforter). When I called to have the item returned, Amazon took no responsiblility for what I call a ""goofy"" package, and I incurred the expense of the return. My daughter likes the Pixie Dust comforter and pillow but I think"
2,Needs an Editor,"Although this book has a reasonable plot line and reasonably well developed characters, it truly needs some editing. The book really drags in places and the misspellings and puncuation mistakes can really irritate after a while. For the price, the book should be more professionally done."
4,I still have this cassette...,"But now I can finally get rid of it. This is a nicely remastered collection of some great seventies music featured in the film FM. Read though the track list, and if you own fewer than half of these songs already, buy this. And if your a Steely Dan nut, know that this only place you'll find the title track's reprise. It's not even on the boxed set from a few years ago. So, that's a nice bonus for the initiated."
5,"A great listening soundtrack, no bad tracks",I had this on Tape and thoroughly enjoyed all of the cuts. It's even better on CD. It is a must for boomers and music lovers of all ages. Pair it up with the movie for a great gift package.
4,Love it!,"I really like the idea of everything in chronological order. That makes understanding the time line of the bible much easier. Also, it is divided into 365 daily readings. Another great part is the author commentary, I really enjoyed reading his explinations!"
4,Fine except for commentary,"I should preface this with the fact I often hate commentary. I love commentary that incites the reader to go past the surface, or evaluate what meanings they've ascribed to passage to inspire new thought and open doors for new revelation. I however find this tows the standard line of most, which is to paraphrase and frame the following scriptures according to their own opinions and theology."
5,Excellant Choice,"The Narrated Bible is a great and easy way to read the Bible since it is in everyday language and also in chronological order which makes it easy to understand putting everything in order. This, of course, doesn't replace the King James and NIV versions, but it is a suberb supplement."
4,The Story,"Although the NIV is not one of my preferred versions of the Bible, this one, combined with Smith's narratives interspersed, keeps the reader engaged in the evolving story of the Word. It's a very easy read and its chronology provides an interesting perspective unavailable in conventional Bibles."
3,Makes a left turn,"While the opening chapters of this book do give you a basic grasp of setting up the server, after that, you're on your own. It gets far too deep into IP protocol theory. I needed to setup users and groups and apply policies, and in the index of the Practical book the word USERS appears only in the preface. It surely was not as practical as one would like. ...The Practical book can get you started but you definitely will need another resource for setting up day-to-day operations. I was rather disappointed after reading all the other glowing reviews here on Amazon, but it wasn't a total waste of money."
5,Best Bell Holder of it's type,"I like this cowbell holder mount for a couple of reasons. First of all Im using a 26"" Kick and the Hoop is a little thick. This mount opens up wide enough to fit and then I can snug it with enough force and it does not leave a mark or a trace of wear on my Ludwig Hoop. This is important to me. And then the bell can be up high enough or low enough and I can move it back forward or reverse away from me as needed. To me the main thing was finding one that didn't bite into my Drum hoop. I used to mount my Bell on a cymbal stand to the right of the ride but lately I have it closer in to the right of my Snare and under my ride. This makes it nice to mix more radically with paradiddles and other patterns within my kit.Can't go wrong with this bell Mount."
5,Skeptical about the calcium but seems to work.,"Got a bad dental cleaning--don't EVER let a dentist or hygienist use a grinder to clean your teeth--it permanently ruins your enamel! (Polish with drill/buffer at the end is okay) Ruined enamel made my teeth feel very dirty all the time, the Mentadent seems to keep them cleaner longer.Odd, that liquid calcium has been making the rounds of brands but now the products that claim Proenamel or similar just have extra floride, that's all--what a scam. Save your money, get some of this while it lasts..........what a minute, that means less for me..........Is this an ADA conspiracy?"
2,A bit of a disappointment,"After reading narratives of a few of the contemporary Everest adventurers (Krakauer, etc) I was interested in reading the views of someone who's been around awhile. Unfortunately, Hillary's account of his own life was even more self-serving than Krakauer's tale of his Everest expedition...and not half as interesting. Maybe it just goes with the personality type but I expected someone at Hillary's stage in life to have a broader view. Also, the writing style is definitely less than spectacular. That said, by the time I get to be Hillary's age I'll be pleased if I can still read...let alone write anything. Overall, not an inspiration and not particularly interesting...I'd pass it up."
2,"An Interesting Book, But...","Unless Edmund Hillary can produce definitive evidence that A.) George Mallory and Andrew Irvine did not reach the summit of Mt. Everest in 1924 or B.) that Tenzing Norgay was not actually the first to set foot on the summit, he cannot truthfully bill himself as ""The First Person to Conquer Everest."""
3,Every turn of the tractor wheel is recounted,"This is a reasonably interesting autobiography, but does get bogged down a bit, especially in the Antarctica passages. At some times it seems as if you are living out every turn of the tractor wheels across Antarctica. Flipping a few pages doesn't hurt though, and the rest of the story more than compensates. It's nice to hear about Hillary's later relationship with Tenzing Norgay...and Hillary's account is borne out in Jamling Tenzing Norgay's story (Jamling is Tenzing's son)."
4,showerbliss footbath,A thoughtfully designed product. It would rate a five star ratingif it could keep the water a bit hotter. The shower causes thewater to cool down a bit.
5,Great Read,"I have always been a huge fan of Joahanna Lyndsey, and thought I had read all her books, but this one came out so of course I had to get it. It was a great book and the characters were so easy to fall in love with! I will be a lifetime fan of Johanna Lyndsey's work."
5,Yet another JL favourite,"You Belong to Me is a wonderful story, which is a sequel to Once A Princess. Alexandra Rubliov and Vasili Petroff are forced to honour a betrothal agreement that their fathers 'supposedly' arranged. Neither are happy about it and do their damndest to get the other to break the engagement. Set in Russian times, you can just imagine the expolsive tempers that they both have. I loved the manner in which Alexandra tried to disgust Vasili and found myself laughing as I thought that Vasili was a bit too full of himself and definitely needed taking down a peg or two. The passion that flares between them was consuming. Neither were prepared to give an inch. Most definitely a keeper, as are all of JL's books (even the odd bad one). This is yet another JL book that I read over and over again."
5,EXCELLENT!EXCELLENT!EXCELLENT!,"Johanna Lindsey never dissapoints me in all of her magnificent compassionate romance stories.Romance runs wilded in 'You Belong to Me', especially between Alexandra and Vasili. Many parts of the story are emphasised in various ways showing so much unexpressible relatively explanations. I was so much inclined with this book that led to a sense nothing could be done while reading 'You Belong to Me', except placing yourself as the main character, Alex. Romance is the key to enticement. I strongly recommend EVERYONE to read this story. Positively,I am sure that little regrets will remain."
3,Rather disappointing,"When I read this book's summary, I thought that it will be really good, because before this book, I have read the book, ""Once a Princess"" and I enjoyed it. This book is a series to it, with the nearly the same characters. But all the arguments and stuff between Vasili and Alexandra were rather boring, although some were quite funny. But not much romance was in it, so I think that this book is a disappointment to me."
3,okay...but...,"I can't believe so many people liked this. It started out fine, sure, but the ending was too rushed. Compare this to Gentle Rogue with all the well-rounded, very real characters Come on, some character development, please!"
2,Yawn,Before I read this book I read Once a Princess And I must say I loved that story but this one was just boring it had afew humorous parts in it but it lacked something.
2,lucky I didn't give it 1 star,"...I have no clue when they actually fell in ""love"" all they did was fight. They were nice to each for like to seconds before their malace for each practically dripped off the pages. Okay, the [physical activity] was good, ...In the end I was hoping they wouldn't get together,..."
1,Ugh!,"This is my all-time least favorite book by JL. Alex has absolutely no appeal, and I'm disgusted that SHE ended up with an Adonis like Vasili."
2,They didn't even know each other,"The only reason they ended up together was because they were beautiful. And so they lusted after each other. But apart from that - nothing! They pretended to be someone else in order to escape the marriage. When they kissed, they suddenly couldn't think at all. I could understand that an inexperienced woman would find a kiss exciting, but a man of his experience wouldn't even think about it twice. And the fact that they only made love once and she was pregnant is just unbelievable. And in the end she escaped to England and decided to marry someone - anyone - in order to have a father for her child. Stupid. And on the last page, they say 'I love you' to each other and are supposed to live happily ever after. Yeah, right."
5,You Belong To Me,"This is a great book. Johanna Lindsey is a master storyteller and this one had a little of everything - great characters, romance, adventure."
3,could of been better,Once a princess was definitely better and I'm beginning to realize that a lot of books by this author tend to be rushed at the end in my opinion leaving me unsatisfied.
1,I really disliked this book and I am a big Johanna Lindsey fan,"I was so surprised to see how many people rated this book with 5 stars. I have every one of Johanna Lindsey's books-a complete collection and I love them all except for ""You Belong To Me."" It was terrible and I agonized through the whole book trying to finish it. It was completely negative and they just simply fought the whole entire book. I didn't see the ""sparks"" between them at all. I can't believe I finished it. I can say the last chapter or two was pretty good, but the rest was just plain awful."
4,A Fun Loving Story To Capture Your Heart!,"Here is another good story by Johanna Lindsey. This is an amusing story and brightens a dull day. This story is about two people who want the same thing, not to marry each other. The only problem is that they don't know that and they both go out of their way to convince each other to break the betrothal. One cannot help but feel for these two and laugh at their antics. Pick this book up and you won't want to put it down."
2,A Disappointing First Book,"when you pick up a book by a highly-acclaimed author, you naturally have high expectations. But I was sorely disappointed with this book.The story is flimsy and the characters not developed. I'm going to read another book GENTLE ROGUE to give Johanna Lindsey a fair chance."
1,"Bicker, bicker, bicker","I hated this book. I usually like Johanna Lindsey but this was torture. What an annoying, spoilt rotten H/h. How they fell in love is beyond me. The H & h fought the entire book and neither had any redeeming qualities. Both acted completely immature and idiotic to repel each other. The fact that the heroine was trying to go without bathing for half the book just turned me off. Yuck!"
2,Just not excited about this one,"This book meanders around rather than sticking to a story. First you have a class of kids learning about Valentine's Day, then you have kids making Valentine cards for their neighbors, then you have them deliver the cards. I guess that last part is the Valentine Express mentioned in the title. The text in each part, however, is just bland. There's no rhyme or pattern to make it fun to read aloud. And it doesn't really make sense. The bunnies talk about their neighbors as if we're supposed to know who they are. Was there an earlier book that we missed? I didn't love the pictures either. I got halfway through trying to figure out why the bunnies all had no eyes, then figured out what I thought were lips were supposed to be one eye for each. I've read it too my 4-year-olds twice and I'm already sure I'm going to hide it after Valentine's Day.My 7-year-old wants to add that she didn't think it was interesting either."
2,TERRIBLE!!,These litter liners are basically garbage bags that rip very easily with my kittens nails.I wouldn't reccomend this product to anyone.Shipping was very fast though.
1,Boring,Don't waste your time with this one. There are so many better books on building a home. This author sounds egotistical and arrogant.
1,Do NOT Buy- BAD BAD BAD,"Do not buy from this maker. They do not work at all and to top it off the unit that was in the box was not what was described on the outside of the box. Based upon the outside of the box, my unit was supposed to have 4 funtions - it came out of the box with only 2. It was supposed to have 3 fan speeds and it came out of the box with only 2. It is a glorified fan - does not cool past 81 degrees. The company does not back their product and told me that they are packed in China and that Haier is not responsible for what happens in China. Go with another maker unless you are just wanting to have a headache."
4,This is great &There is so much more to come,"Sean Malone is a genius. There is no question of that. If there is a bass player, or stick player for that matter, who feels comfortable in their abilities, listen to this album. It will make you humble is a hurry. Keep an eye on Sean."
1,Derivative and Unoriginal,"My .02:Having heard this CD, and subsequently borrowing it from a fellow bass player recently, the sad fact is that Sean Malone is trying to fill the shoes of Jaco Pastorius. The problem is that Malone's phrasing is hollow and cold, precise but emotionless, and yet you can still hear Jaco in there. No new fretless ground is broken on any of the tracks. It seems Malone has written a trancription book of Jaco's solos recently which might explain the obvious nod to the late, great bassist on Malone's CD. The only thing wrong with that is the multitudes of Jaco-clones already in the industry (Mark Egan, etc.). You can hear Jaco's influence in many different genres, so why would you buy this CD when you could purchase a classic Weather Report or Jaco solo album and hear the original. Either way, if you're looking for innovative fretless bass playing, pick up a CD w/Percy Jones or Mick Karn, and leave 'Cortlandt' alone."
3,Poor crossover for a subwoofer,I was not expecting much but there is way too much lower mids coming through. I can hear male and female voices coming through.
1,"Provocative title, bad writing","I was excited when I downloaded this book, thinking it would provide what the blurb promised. And perhaps it does, if you can manage to wade through the excess of bad writing, poor plotting, and tedious narrative. I find it very difficult to believe a hardcover copy, listed at $15.66, would ever exist if not for print-on-demand. I really wanted it to be better."
4,Love it.,"This is a great shirt! I love the fists of Fury, and the way Kyo looks. The only bad thing is that he bear looks more like a cuddly teddy bear, and people will call it that. Some people even called Kyo, Ichigo (Bleach) Sadly. But all in all, It's a great item."
2,"Works, but not well at all.","I recently installed the natural gas conversion kit on my Camp Chef triple burner stove. As others have said, it was a difficult installation, and after it was complete, the flame was only about half the size of original. After emailing back and forth with customer service, they mentioned that ""When you hook up to natural gas you lose about a third of the btu output on the stove. Natural gas dosen't have the pressure or the heat of propane. You can drill out the oriface in each valve to .082 inches or a #45 drill bit to get the heat back up. Once you do that you can not use it with propane again."" That's a direct quote (copy and paste) from their email, misspelling and all. And when I asked if they sell replacement orifices, they offered a whole valve assembly.Long story short, don't waste your money unless you are comfortable purchasing new valve assemblies."
3,Difficult to install?,"I recently took delivery of a Weber NG (natural gas) Spirit, which came with a hose that looks remarkably like this one. I had the gas line extended to our deck and when I got the Weber, I found that I needed a reducing fitting that reduced the pipe diameter at the gas line to fit the hose fitting. I took the hose and the cover cap from the gas line (the line has a cut-off valve at the stub) to the local Ace hardware and a young fellow helped find the proper fitting (from 3/4"" to 3/8"". I also needed to add a very short piece of pipe (called a nipple) and an ell to complete the assembly. Took all this stuff home and within the hour we were grilling a steak, which turned out just right.I'm in the market for a second hose to convert a smoker from charcoal to NG and I'll probably buy the one shown above."
1,Obie,The editorial review states that this item is compatible with Palm Zire 71. This is not the case. The stylus is the wrong size.
5,Great complement to CIT,"I am currently studying for my last CCNP exam : support.I find this book a great complement of CIT.There is an error in book description : it is 1025 pages (not 714, which should be the size of the paperback edition), so it is much more complete than the online version on CCO.I reccomend it in addition to CIT for passing support.Note : I passed the 3 previous ccnp exams first try by using cisco ccnp course books."
3,Wrong Color,"The color is much darker than the one pictured here. Instead of a bright, pretty aqua blue, it's a dark blue."
5,exegetical critic,"This is the best book on family/parenting on the market. Getz is an exegete who does his homework and faithfully communicates the teachings of Scripture. He gives an excellent treatment of the subject matter without the usual evangelical weirdnesses (much less abuses). Every believer who wishes to raise a family should read this book, especially the aspiring biblical husband/father."
5,"A real hard hitting c.d., with strong lyrics and beats.","I think that wise is one of the best east coast artist ever. His style is like no other. The way he fuses his pure poverty style is truly holy intellect. The way his lyrics just pour out flawlessly, is a true sign that he is all about black business. I hope that P.R.T. will release another compact disc.""So the blind man sees and deaf man speaks, cause wise civilized them."
5,Wise siempre dando el ejemplo,"Admiro MCs como Wise Intelligent que se preocupan por las futuras generaciones.Siempre da un ejemplo de positivismo y hace sentir orgullo por las minorías,sin alejarse del verdadero hip hop.Su estilo evoluciona tanto con el género como con las situaciones que afectan la sociedad.Y como un verdadero proféta y revolucionario nunca traiciona sus principios y combate el materialismo y la imagen negativa que proyectan la mayor1a de los raperos."
2,Nothing much new in these two,"Having seen most of the Pokemon films, I was disappointed in these two. Frankly I got bored really fast, too much like other Pokemon stuff, and even the stunning visuals and special effects did not seem as good as previous outings. The second movie is so similar to the first, I did not even bother to finish viewing. Ok if you haven't seen much Pokemon stuff it will seem pretty good, but perhaps rent it first..if you are not a diehard fan."
4,good books!,I got these book for my 2 year old daughter and she just loves them! She has such fun naming the colors and shapes and objects inside the books and she also likes to stack them. They come in a box with handles for easy carry around. I recommend these to any child.
1,What were they thinking?,"Whoever designed this books didnt think about kids and has no imagination whatsoever.Construction - flimsy.Content - repeats over and over again from book to book.- what bonehead decided to explain the concept of triangle to a child by showing musical instrument ""triangle""?- dull images.Bottom line - wasted money..."
1,Amazon deleted my review!,"I gave this set of books 1 star but should be giving it 0! Amazon deleted my review, so here it is again, in a more concise manner.1) Books for numbers 6 and 9 are the same. No reply from publisher when I attempted to contact them 3 time via emails.2) The last page of all number books end with candles, that is 1/4 of all the number books. I feel shortchanged!3) books are flimpsy at the spine. Baby managed to tear one.Question: Does Amazon delete bad reviews? Maybe that's why I haven't seen candid and truthful reviews!"
1,Not the edition advertised,"The kindle version is NOT the Penguin Edition that it claims to be. Rather, you get the IndyPublishers edition translated by Benjamin Jowett. Amazon needs to correct this error. If you care about the translation and publisher, do not buy this."
1,Wrong Kindle Edition,"This review is for the Kindle edition of what is supposedly the Christopher Gill translation of Plato's Symposium. However it turns out if you download it that it is the same as the Benjamin Jowett translation which is available for free, whereas here you have to pay upwards of $8 for it. I also checked Penguin Classics web site and they do not indicate that a eBook version of this book is available. So be careful when purchasing the Kindle edition. I had to return my purchase for this Kindle book."
5,A way to make routine dating fun!!,"This is a great book for any single woman! Dating can become rather annoying at times, and this book is a way to liven things up for yourself. There is space for you to evaluate each date you have, score it and decide whether or not you will go out with him again. There is even a space for you to draw a sketch of the guy. This book can make you smile even after an awful first date!"
2,This product is PAL,"Beat Furrer (*1954)Begehren MusiktheaterThis product is PAL.And the picture and the sound set different sources. The sound is a studio recording, not recorded live on stage.Therefore, the picture and sound are on a wrong time.This picture is only worthy knowing of stage performance."
3,"This is science, not gore.","You don't see melting bodies, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-type of stuff. The point of this work is that scientists are looking for ways to predict the times, strength, and dimensions of future eruptions.The work said there are 1,500 active volcanoes across the globe. In the past 2,000 years, approximately 200,000 victims of volcanoes. When that volcano erupted in Iceland, it stopped transatlantic flights and made companies lose $2 billion dollars!I'm not into science that much, so all the studying, or trying to study volcanoes wasn't that interesting. However, geologists and others interested in science would love it.What I liked were the computer graphics. They made complicated geological phenomena more understandable. It was fascinating to see lightning arise in an ash cloud. I didn't not know Yellowstone was a volcanic area.This work may be too advanced for elementary school students, but teachers could show this in junior high and high school classes."
4,"A nice visit to the Zone, with one exception","I really enjoyed this book as Earl Hamner's Zone episodes were some of my favorites of the series and I loved being able to read the original writing for myself. The writing on this show was always top-notch, so having the words in front of me is amazing. My only complaint about the book is that in the written review/synopsis of Ring-a-Ding Girl following the script, the author Tony Albarella says that Mary Munday, who played the female lead's sister in the episode, voiced Cruella De Vil in 101 Dalmatians. This is close to the truth, but not entirely correct. Betty Lou Gerson, who also appeared in the episode as the female lead's agent, was the actual voice of Cruella in 101 Dalmatians. I just thought I'd point that out because it was not accurate information, but the rest of the book is and an enjoyable read at that."
2,Supervap,"This movie is the epitome of '70's custom van culture flicks. If you're looking for van culture, this is a very bad choice.Made at the pinnacle of the tiresomely simple 1970's van culture craze, this low-budget action flick follows custom van driver Clint Morgan (Mark Schneider) in his dumb van.The production values are low and the story flavorless, even the hokey action scenes aren't original enough to be amusing on any level.However, its low-budget custom van culture camp, generic humor and (thankfully) short running time save the film as an unintentional 70's comedic piece."
4,"Smart design, but some room for improvement","The fan blade style design is an intelligent way to make a solar device more compact and portable. However, I feel the device is still bulkier than it needs to be. The solar cells only cover about 75% of the surface area of the blades. Why not make the blades closer to the size of the cells or the cells sized to match the blades (which may give an increase in power generation). The internal battery idea is great. It works well. The charge indicator is a little lacking. It's a button that flashes once for 25% charge, twice for 50%, etc... I think an LED bar light would work better for this indicator.I use this device with my Palm Treo 650 and my iPod Video. So far, I have no real complaints. It works exactly as solio claims it does. I just see some room for slight improvements."
3,Interesting Later Material,"I should have reviewed the product description more carefully before I placed my order for this CD. While there is nothing bad about the material on this CD, I was more interested in hearing the artist's earlier recordings."
5,"Superb, Captures the Film","The powerful, metallic tracks are Hijack (1), Mission Impossible Theme (5) and Bio-Techno (8). Zap Mama Iko Iko (2) (fun song!), The Heist (6), and Nyah and Ethan (15) are very ethnic tracks; You'll escape to Mexico in your mind.My favorite tracks are Seville (3) (very reminescent of the Gypsy Kings) and Nyah (4) (sweet yet sad, a Zimmer masterpiece, and makes the soul sing) and Mission Accomplished (14) (carries the same melody as (4)).A must-have album if you loved the film, work for the Center of Disease Control, or have USAMRIID training!"
4,Music to get a speeding ticket by...,"A good soundtrack needs to stand on its own as music. The latest Zimmer disc does just that, but parts stand up better than others.My favorite track is Bare Island (Track #10)which combines Zimmer's penchant for Wagnerian style music and a real twist - heavy electric guitar.The Flamenco style guitar tracks (tracks #3 and #4)are colorful and evoke the mood of the movie almost immediately.Where the soundtrack fell short was those of you expecting a traditional arrangment of the MI theme won't find one. Although there are variations on the theme on several tracks, the track labeled as the theme (track #5)is a scant 40 seconds or so...what happened did the rest of the track self destruct!Overall though the CD is still a must buy for any Zimmer fan, anyone who liked the film, or anyone who likes action soundtracks."
4,An Interesting Musical Mosaic,"I bought this CD because I had enjoyed Zimmer's ""Gladiator"" immensely. I wasn't expecting such a mosaic of styles all in one soundtrack. The MTV-ish rock of Zap Mama's ""Iko-Iko"" (Track 2), the flamenco clatter of ""Seville"" (Track 3), and the haunting chorale at the opening of ""Bare Island"" (Track 10) are just a few of the samples of Zimmer's versatility. And, of course, Lalo Schifrin's classic TV theme pops up regularly, whether in its original form or slightly reworked. The track will never rank as one of my all-time favorites, but if you don't mind a certain edginess, it's a good listen."
4,SMOOTH AND GRITTY,"I LIKED IT! IT HAS THE NECESSARY ZIMMER ELEMENTS WITH A BIT OF NEW ONES LIKE THE OPENING NUMBERS AND THEN GRADUALLY MOVES TO THE ZIMMER CHORUS BACKGROUD MUSIC.IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN ""THE PEACEMAKER' AND MORE FRESH THAN GLADIATOR,BUT I SERIOULSLY MISS (MISS)LALO SHCIFORING AND DANNY ELFMAN(HE SHOULD HAVE GOT AN OSCAR FOR THAT SCORE). CHOOSE THIS SOUNDTRACK AND IT WILL NOT SELF DESTRUCT IN FIVE SECONDS."
2,"Overall, very disappointing.","While I'm usually a fan of Hans Zimmer's work, this album just didn't work for me. Musically, it was alright, but the main title theme sounded like a bad immitation of Danny Elfman's version for the previous movie. Overall, I can't say I enjoyed it all that much."
4,better than the commercial soundtrack,"Hans Zimmer fans should be pleased with this all around great score. It's different than his average score, delving more into the hard guitar sounds. Personally, I think it blows away the commercial soundtrack because it feels more like (and it should) how MI2 should be. If you like Hans Zimmer's work, then this is a definite purchase for you, especially if you're ready for something fresh. If you saw the movie and liked the music, then find someone to let you listen to it first and then fork over the cash, because you're bound to be pleased."
5,Injection is Incredible!,"Haunting.Powerful.Mesmerizing.Thrilling.Glorifying.Righteous.The actress,Thandie Newton enhanced the song's depth and beauty with her own.It made for an incredibly touching scene! Her and Tom matched perfectly together!The song blends sacrifice,beauty,sadness,death and violence in an intoxicating beautiful way.So many emotions in one piece of music. Incredible! I am now HOOKED to Lisa Gerrard! Never has a human voice wrought so many emotions!An excellent,moody piece to dramatize any task or moment. Play it when having a serious conversation, or when you need to be alone and think.Of course, the rest of this album is great too!:)"
2,Worthless,"This cd WOULD be worthless... Except for the fact that one of the tracks is incredible, ""Injection"". It is beautiful and fast, and when you hear it you won't be able to stop listening to it. The rest of the score, however, is weak. The theme from ""Injection"" is heard in ""Mano a Mano"", which is a decent track as well. But even it can't bump the score to this album up. The rest of the score is filled with spanish style sounds, too much guitar for an action score, and it just isn't typical Zimmer. Definately the most dissapointing Zimmer score in the past few years. After doing my 3 personal favorites (Prince of Egypt, The Thin Red Line, Gladiator), its a shame he couldn't keep it up. Oh well, at least I have Pearl Harbor to look foward to."
4,Hans is the man,I have always liked anything Hans Zimmer has composed...Crimson Tide was another I loved. I really think that anyone who likes Zimmer should purchase the CD.
5,A great resource for parents and professionals,"When my son was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome The OASIS web site was the first place I found answers. This book provides the same user-friendly format and an abundance of helpful information.Originally diagnosed with severe adhd and ODD I felt like there was little hope of understanding my son, until I discovered Barb Kirby and her vault of info! I am thankful for the hope this book provides... there are answers to be found, you just have to know where to look. This book guides you to them just as the site did and still does! I am now the author of The ADHD-Autism Connection, not only is the OASIS Guide listed in my recommended reading section... but I personally suggest it as the best resource available for further information on Asperger's syndrome. Thank you ladies for providing such a wonderful resource, I will continue recommending it to all my readers and anyone who asks"
1,Will the real Chuck Wagon PLEASE stand up.,"If you are looking for the Chuck Wagon And The Wheels from Tucson in the late 70's/early 80's you better stick to the old LPs. If this is them, and I seriously doubt it is, they made a 180 degree turn somewhere along the way. This is not Western Swing.You have been warned."
2,"Hey, they BOUGHT the name!!","This has no connection with the Chuck Wagon & The Wheels band from the 70's-80's. These guys are from Memville or Nashphis or somewhere, and bought the name. The album ain't horrible, but it's kinda like a tribute band. Luckily I was able to find a Chuck Wagon & The Wheels compilation at cdbaby.com with a quick search after hearing CW&TW ""Ghost Riders"" medley on kfat.com. Do that search. You'll be happier with that than this pasture patty"
1,What happend to Chuck Wagon and the Wheels,"Chuck Maultsby sold the rights to the name ""Chuck Wagon and the Wheels"" to another band back in the late 80s after the band broke up. So anything recorded after the 80s is by the new band. These day you can find Chuck performing live with most of the band around Tucson and New Mexico. Their new band name is ""Chuck Wagon and the Wheelchairs""!!"
4,Amazing Comical CD!,"Being a great fan of comical music, I really enjoyed this CD. Off The Top Rope had comedy at every corner. It made laugh continuesly through the last track of the CD. Chuck Wagon and The Wheels contain a humor in their music that nobody in Country music can counter, including Jeff Foxworthy. Chuck Wagon has a vibrate and vast array of comedy to display in this music. I recommend anyone who likes comical music at all to purchase this CD!"
3,good start,"these guys are sure funny, i would like to see them rock a bit more, ala cdb, marshall tucker, etc. i found it to be very fun to listen to, and i am not a country music fan.....in fact i think country music IS A JOKE!!!!!!there was a band in the 80's out of tucson by the same name, who were in the same style, we called it ""country punk"". while no known relation to those guys, these guys are off to a fine start.the vocals are part of the joke, though very good, as is the playing. it is almost as if they are making fun of country music.recommended as a deversion from whatever ails you, hope they make more music for us, and succedd while doing it."
2,Lasted for two years,"The battery worked fine for two years and one month, but the UPS now indicates that it needs to be replaced. I was hoping for at least 4 years from this battery."
3,Not for beginners!,"Instructions are unclear; you have to read them several times. Does not discuss needles, thread, sewing versus hoop stabbing, nor explain how to carry thread behind invisably so that your work looks good from both sides. The designs are nice and the explanations might be helpful for experienced hardanger stitchers."
2,white garter belt and also black,"I ordered one in white and one in black....its a pretty good product, although not sure how long the garter belts will last being that the hooks are plastic and not metal.....also they are suppose to be the same size but they are not......"
1,Far below expectations,"I must admit, I baught this DVD due to the two good reviews it had on this site. I intended to use this DVD to help teach the Beatles in a music appreciation class. This is a horrible documentary. The production qualities are very poor, it is long and drawn out, and there is clearly some ""screaming girls"" sounds dubbed on it. I would not recommend this to any one except perhaps some die-hard Beatles fans who want to see some new footage."
3,Decent,"I am an inveterate Beatles' fan and I admit I enjoyed this. There was some fresh film footage, but very little in the way of new material.Still, it is a good ""starter"" film for people just becoming aware of the Beatles and their meteoric influence and indelible stamp on culture. I would far recommend the Beatles' Anthology over this one."
1,Don't Bother!,There are plenty of better DVD's about the Beatles out there. Save your money for one of those.
1,"Save Your Money, Folks","This is flat out the worst piece of shit I have ever seen in a so-called documentary of either The Beatles or anyone else for that matter. Spotty, inaccurate and so full of the filmmaker's lame-brained and asinine opinions that it will make you want to throw things. Cobbled together with footage from God knows where, this poor excuse for a film is an agonizing exercise in plain stupidity. It's not even remotely entertaining. If you absolutely must see this, borrow it from a library and watch it first before you buy. The box says 'Collector's Edition DVD' but they really mean 'Completist.' Save your money and stick to the Anthology. Sorry Amazon, for blowing a potential sale but product like this is best reserved for landfills."
1,Sizing extremely incorrect,"I have purchased this item before from another source and they were exceptional slippers. The sizing from the other source was perfect. This pair, although of the same quality, is so much larger than the other pair (exact same size) that they had to be returned, at my cost, which I believe is very unfair. Apparently, this slipper runs very inconsistent in sizing, so you are better off purchasing the slipper from a source that has free shipping both ways."
1,Awful movie.,"Ultra low budget, but not in a good way. Bad lighting throughout, annoying and ridiculous characters, cheap blood and gore effects/cgi, this here was truly a piece of sh**. A close group of friends who are heroin addicts hide out in an abandoned house after one of their buddies kills himself.. they get messed up on a bad batch and start killing each other.. yep. Avoid this movie at all costs. Waste of time."
3,"Good text, but a little too old","I bought this book because many reviewers here gave highest rates. But since this book was written in 1971, they use some obsolete words (for example, Chinese people don't usually call each other ""tongzhi"" any more), and some Chinese characters shown in this book have been further simplified ever since, so you need to unlearn and relearn some stuff if you really want to learn ""modern Chinese"".Also, some grammatical topics which should be covered in a basic course such as comparison are not covered. Overall, this is a good text for beginners, but you will need to supplement it with a more comprehensive and up-to-date text before going on to intermediate level."
3,This is one of the better books I have seen,"Wonderful introduction to the language, though not always consistent between standard and simplified form usage."
2,CANT STAY TOGETHER!,"Having purchased all of the GI JOE weapon tech sets, I was disappointed in this one. The pieces are very authentic and match thier real-life counterparts. One big problem though - the pices don't stay together. The barrel guards (part that you hold on the barrel) just slips off the main housing. Also the magazine will not stay firmly in place. IT JUST WON'T STAY TOGETHER! If you are looking to purchase a weapon tech toy, I would get the H&K G-36 or the LR-300 AR."
1,Miss Leading Size,When we ordered this product we thought we were getting a gun that was bigger (guess I need to read the fine print on size). There should be a disclaimer next to the photo. The worst thing was the sad looks on boy's faces when we opened the box.
1,Misleading size,"well i bought these thinking the kids will have fun with these. they come in the mail the kids are so excited. then they see the box and look on they're faces was undescribeable. then one said that maybe they came in two boxes and the other wasn't here yet. But they opened the box to find action figure size guns..... i am not happy and neither are my kids. so, if you are looking for a gun that the kids can play with it's not this one."
1,the bad gun,"I bought this thinking it would be life size but when it go to my house I was completey frusterated when I got this 3 inch long GI JOE gun. Ihave tried a few toy guns, but this is clearly the worst."
4,Digipower PG-ND50 Battery Grip for Nikon D50,"Great functionality. However, it definitely needs a vertical release button for portrait shooting. Plastic construction makes long-term durability an concern."
4,Excellent,Yet another set of evidence that makes it increasingly less likely that our existence is the product of random and directionless forces. Well produced and packed with scientific fact this DVD is a must for anyone who is interested in the current debate between fundamentalist atheists and intelligent design proponents.
5,WOW,It's exciting to see just how unique and amazing GOD made planet earth and the universe. His signature is plain to see. The scientific research and documentation in this presentation are awesome.
4,The Privileged Planet - is the earth in a unique location in the galaxy?,"Despite Carl Sagan's pontifications, the earth may have been purposed placed where it is by a Creator-designer.Watch this with an open mind, or don't bother, if you think life is accidental."
4,"Regardless, we are privileged!","I believe the difference between good scientists and bad, some can see how small they really are when studying the facts, laws, and principles that have to be in place for life to be possible. These are demonstrated in this video in a interesting format. Gonzales has a great job, which he worked hard to be good at, and I think he is small enough in ego to be big. If you don't see purpose here, still you will understand how privileged this planet really is."
1,Do not buy this DVD It pretends to be science it is religion pure and simple,"This DVD just tries to push religion.That's it.If you want to buy a DVD pushing a made up view of the world go for it.They just anomaly hunt to support an idea they started out with ie that god made the universe.They make many more logical fallacies...It is a very dishonest video as it pretends to be science but is not.Why would you believe anyone who is dishonest?Who deliberately sets out to hide there true identity.You need to look in the extras Questions and Answers before their true identity is revealed pushing the Christian religion.When someone pushing an argument hides their true identity it usually means they have a weak argument and this is certainly true here.As a christians you are supposed to be honest, well hiding your identity makes a lie to this belief and so makes them hypocrites.A thoroughly deceitful DVD."
3,Nice production but....,"I just finished watching this video. It is well produced. Lots of production value in it. If you are of the creationist (AKA Intelligent Design) mindset then this will be quite the treat. If you are like me and like to think for yourself you will find this video pretty funny. They cherry pick like crazy and do lots of logical acrobatics. If you are thinking of buying this nice trip through pseudoscience I suggest you first read up on Guillermo Gonzalez. This video is pretty much based on his ID(Creationist) work at Iowa State. In a nutshell they are trying to say ""intelligent"" life MUST come about like we did(created). It's a bit like assuming what the rest of the world is like based only on your small neighborhood. Or ""Since this large rock is such a nice and comfy place for me to rest my rather large backside upon this must mean it was made for me."" You get the idea. I give them an A for the production. I give them an F for any meaningful content."
1,DECIDE for YOURSELF... START with an empty slate...NO CHANCE & NO GOD... Then come to your own conclusion,let's see...aeons went by... somehow... your house came out of thin air. the materials decided to somehow put itself together into a nice design that... hey... actually has some practical purpose... wait a minute... can it be? wow it's even nice to look at... and imagine all if it came by chance...look no one has to be a christian to see the logic.all these years... the premise was we came from a simple cell... DUHHHHHH! no such thing... who needs to be a christian to see that?Look i have SERIOUS DOUBTS in all this happening by chance... BUT why worry about any comments 1 star or 5...In the end if it's important to YOU. Then you can do YOUR own research. check out both sides of the issue... from an objective point of view. NO EVOLUTION... NO GOD. And then decide FOR YOURSELF.Remember... your clueless to believe evolution/chance or God if you don't research it yourself.
2,"""Intelligent Design"" propaganda","This documentary is produced by the fundamentalist christian movement whose agenda it is to get Darwin's theory of evolution banned from schools and have it replaced by ""Intelligent Design"", which really just means creation, as put forth in the bible. As can be expected from a documentary with an agenda to convince the viewer of a certain point, rather than being open minded, it does not really go anywhere. It keeps repeating the point that ""scientists agree"" that life could not have developed anywhere else in the universe.The other reviewers here must be people associated with ""the cause,"" this really is not a five star production simply because instead of sincerely investigating the subject with an open mind you get science, contorted to fit religion."
5,I liked it.,Interesting points about the creation of the universe and especially this planet. How delicate it is in a violent universe. The balances that have to be so fine-tuned to make life possible.
1,Simply put: do your own research,"While the producers of this ""documentary"" try hard to make their points, they fail miserably in the end not addressing the ""rest of the story"". This is, at best, a half-baked attempt to appease those whose minds are already made up. Arguments for ""ID"" are made, but certain important facts are ignored -- facts that would hurt their own arguments.Get it if the subject interests you, but be sure to do more research on your own. You might find a much wider, much grander world opening before your eyes.In other words, make up your own mind, but be sure you have *all* of the available evidence."
1,Discovery Institute Imitation,"This is the Discovery Institute's imitation of Emes ""Powers of Ten"" and ""Cosmic Voyage,"" in another attempt to establish Intelligent Design as science. The Discovery Institute's key witnesses lied in the recent Kitzmiller case and even went so far as to include astrology as ""science.""The Discovery Institute has been thoroughly discredited and its products should be avoided. Get the genuine DVDs, avoid this DVD."
5,"Utterly Believable, Fascinating, Surprising!","I did not expect such a well thought out and well done presentation. The best video of this type that I have ever seen! Reasonable, logical, and very thought provoking. I cannot wait to read the book to get more of the in depth facts and figures, and for a more complete explanation of this exciting subject matter. I will also look into obtaining copies of the various scientific articles published on this material that the narrator referred to in the video. The video is a little short (60 minutes) for the ground that it covers, but it is still excellent. Fascinating. Science is ever so fun and sometimes surprising."
1,Worst Amplified Antenna,I used couple of amplified antenna's before but this is the worst one. First of all it says stick it behind the rear view mirror on the windshield. The wire does not even pass glove box. Next the reception was worst than stock antenna in the rear window. I would not recommend this antenna to anyone.
1,A lesson for all here.,Without religion it would be easy to see good men doing good things and bad men doing bad things. With religion bad men can do bad things and justify those things under the guise of religion. However good men can also do bad things behind the same religion. Here we have a fine example of either. You can pick which man you see here. Whichever way you go it does not remove the fact that BAD things have been done. That is the message of this book.
1,Faith in what?,Has anyone noticed that this same author wrote a book called The Faith of Barack Obama?He makes both of these men out to be Christians because of their faith in the God of the Bible.But the only faith that these two men share is the same faith so many so called Christians in America hold to and that is the faith in BIG GOVERNMENT.Though using different routes both men are leading this country in the same direction-Down.Both men believe in saving the world through the New World Order and not through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.If you want to vote for a true Christian and for real American values vote for the Constitution party Candidate.Thank you
2,Fairly factual but biased...,This book is basically a biography of Bush's life from a more religious perspective. In it they compare how Bush's beliefs supposedly shaped his life.While the book seems truthful it leaves out alot of facts. It does not mention the scadals going on at the time or screw ups he had made.The other problem is that the book is dated as it was released pre his reelection. The author might be writing a totally different book about how religion screwed up his presidency with the scandal and blunders hes in now.In the end it was a decent read thoug for facts i would rather stick to a less biased source. As i said this author seemed very much like a buddy of Bush's putting a book out for him.
5,I'll be inspired in spite of short sighted people.,"Someone sent me an email about The Faith of George W. Bush and The Faith of George W. Bush: Companion Study Guide. I had heard about the main book but not the study guide.At our Methodist church, a member of our Sunday School class will be teaching a series from these two books. We are excited about it. I hope a lot of people will email their friends about it.I'll be inspired in spite of short sighted people. One reviewer even said Christianity is stupid. I think that says a lot about the reviewer and nothing about the book."
1,"""Religiously Correct""","Organized religion is great if/when it leads one to true spirituality. For many however it seems to simply be a list of dos and don't prescribed to them by previous generations. A connection to god is reflected in ones connections to humanity. It is shown in ones abilities to give of themselves to others and in ones ability to empathize with others. Bush may have gone through some transformations in his life and he certainly knows the ""religiously correct"" way to speak, but I don't see evidence of a true spiritual journey within his actions. I hope for his sake and for ours he is someday able to find his way."
4,Very intersting,I would recommend this book it does look into Mr Bush and his thinking I happen to like Mr.Bush I thinkhe is a very intersting person.
1,But does he go to church?,"It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either."
2,Boring,"There is nothing new in this book. The author gives semi-interesting background on the Bush family, then follows several rabbit trails from Ozzy Osbourne to Pat Robertson. Disappointing, which is too bad because if the author did some real research this could have been a very interesting book."
1,Mediocre book on a below average subject,"Shrub curses a LOT, everyone knows that. And his use of christianity for politics is shameful and definetly UN-christian like. This book isn't sanctioned by the bush administration, but is being promoted as such by the far radical religious right."
5,Great Job!,"This is a very good book. Finally, a real look at a true man of God. This book shows how he lives by & has guided this country by his faith in God. He will be the first to admit he not always lived the way he should have, but he always had the religious background. I have always thought highly of Mr. Bush, not only when he was governor of my home state, but as the president and as a fellow christian. This is a very revealing book of his faith and his life in general. This was a book that once I opened it I could not put it down. Every so often It did sort of drag, but it is a GREAT book about our President. I plan to read it again."
5,A must-read for before the 2004 elections,"Mansfield documents how Bush's faith informs his world view and political decisions. This book makes clear how Bush is pushing this county toward a theocracy, endangering not only our freedoms as US citizens but the stability of the entire world by pursuing foreign policy rooted in religious delusions and a messiah complex."
1,do people actually believe this?,"trying to display bush as a man of faith seems pretty far fetched. Religion and a persons deep belief in the after life is displayed to others by good deeds, not selfish ends. The actions of our President have been destructive, ended many lifes, and caused wide spread suffering."
5,The Faith of George W. Bush,"This is a wonderful, insightful book. Stephen Mansfield is an excellent, straight forward, biographer. I recommend this book highly to those who want to get to know our President better."
2,Unhelpful,"I'm using this book for a graduate course in probability for political science, and I have been very disappointed with it. The main problem is that it skips steps involved in problems and then tells you that ""obviously"" or ""clearly"" or ""intuitively"" the solution to the problem follows. For example, my professor has had to distribute his own detailed explanations of sample problems in the book, which have been much clearer (and longer) than what the book offers. If math is not intuitive for you or your quantitative skills are rusty, this book does not give you the kind of step-by-step guidance you'll need."
2,Not really for beginners,"I used this book for a engineering probabilities class. The prof. was one of those less than helpful types who tossed out a lecture and then let the class sink or swim. If that hadn't been the case maybe I would have rated the book higher, but since I was pretty much using this as my sole source of learning it was not helpful at all.It's written in more of a conversational tone; which isn't always a bad thing. However the equations shown and the dervations the author goes through are not well documented neither are they intuitive to follow. Does every math book need to be easy and intuitive? No, they don't. But if they bill themselves as a ""beginner's guide"" then they probably should.(A friend in the class told me to pick up the Idiot's Guide to Probablity and we used that as our textbook instead. We we're the only two to get A's in that class)"
2,Very lite on the depth.,"If you are looking to find out more about the players and their lives, maybe doing a wiki search is better than this video. This movie does contain highlights and interviews, but I was looking to learn more about the players' personal life, attended clubs, and success stories. I just saw the video and I already forgot half of the stars mentioned. I did not even walk away knowing more about Beckham or even Donovan, who is my favorite and the reason I bought the DVD. It is not a bad documentary but you should not use this movie if you are looking to walk away more informed about these players. It was also semi-short and it lacked xtra features. However, go MLS!"
4,Coleman Exponent 2 burner stove,"I am a campstove HO. Yep, I've got most of them including several Svea 123's still in the box. I brought that up so you know when I say I like this stove it must have something. It is sturdy (should last a lifetime), the smallest two burner stove I've ever seen. The fuel is about the same price as other isobutane types and lasts as long or longer. I also bought the adapter to run standard isobutane cartridges so I would never be stuck. This is my primary motorcycle camping stove. It also uses standard cookware unlike some of the new water boilers (my Jetboil & MSR reactor set on the shelf). It does not have nor is there a provision for an igniter; that would make it even better."
2,boring,This book was nothing special at all. From beginning to end it was pretty cliche and just wasn't interesting enough to spend time on.
4,Grandma Lois,"I am reading this book right now, and I don't want to put it down. Looking forward to the answer, yet I dont want the book to be finished."
4,Murder Mystery,Book in good condition. Typical New Orleans story. Only the French Quarter exist and that is where everyone lives. A little cliche.
4,Down in New Orleans (Five Star Romance),"This seems like an early work by Graham. I prefer her later books. A good mystery. Liked the characters. Didn't know who did it until quite late in the story. Really can't ask more than that in a story. It kept me engaged. I recommend this book, especially because of the setting."
3,Loved Heather Graham,"My favorite down time is reading, so I read a lot. There was a time I wouldn't miss, one of Heather Graham's books. Not anymore."
5,It's not supposed to be serious!,"Presumably, everyone already knows how to breathe and make a bed. Clearly, there's another point to this book other than to teach you how-to. Reading this little gem is something like watching an episode of Monk: you share in the madness of people who pay attention to aspects of the mundane and turn the quotidian into a form of art. Sure, some tips are funnier than others. You will laugh if you enjoy the absurd. You will be puzzled and disappointed if you take things literally. But really, don't you know how to wash your hair?!"
4,THE FUN IS IN THE LISTENING,"A lot of the fun in listening to this audio book is hearing the voices of the four talented readers who deliver all of this advice in chatty, conversational tones. It's a bit like listening to good friends share their hard earned wisdom.As for the wisdom, well, much of it's practical yet on the light side - Heloise tells us how to do laundry, and Bob Vila weighs in on painting a room. Manners are a must, so Letitia Baldridge offers instructions on the appropriate way to shake hands, and Peggy Post's pointers center on setting a formal table.Larry King lets us know how to listen, and even though you thought you didn't need any advice in this area, Bikram Choudhury offers hints on how to breathe for a healthier you.The list of celebs imparting expertise is lengthy and well chosen for the variety of topics. Even Mrs. Fields divulges her secrets for those famous Chocolate chip Cookies. Who could resist?- Gail Cooke"
1,Totally pointless,"The essays were moderately amusing, but not a good use of my time. If you want short amusing essays, go for something like Gig or I Thought My Father Was God instead. The advice given is often too general or too pointless to be useful (e.g., To Keep Warm -- eat right, keep your body in shape, have the right equipment; To Conduct a Background Investigation -- hire a private detective).Maybe two of the essays were valuable if you really don't know how to tie a Winsor knot or a bow tie, but this isn't really the best way to find out because you'll never remember that the information is here and that's what the internet is for anyway."
2,Mixed Bag,"A friend got this for me on my 30th birthday, and I thought it was the perfect gift...until I read it.I was reminded of an infamous assignment one teacher gave my class in Junior High: We were asked to explain, in writing, how to tie our shoes--the goal being, of course, to make us aware just how difficult it can be to effectively articulate ANYTHING.Needless to say, most of us failed...but I'm feeling a little better about myself now that I've read this book. Most of these 'experts' simply CANNOT explain/impart much of what they know in writing--making their entries frustrating, especially for people like me, who were actually hoping to pick up a tip or two from reading the book!What's interesting to note, though, is that the 'problem' entries are usually not the oddly nebulous ones, like Stephen Covey's terrific MANAGE YOUR TIME. It's the 'simple' ones like MAKE A BED that, mysteriously, elude their authors.A mixed bag."
4,"Some trivial, some not","some of this things you need to know are pretty trivial, but I guess you need to know them. It was an interesting read."
1,Spiritual... maybe. Technology? No.,"Why to try to raise spiritiuality of current generation with doubtful speculations? Yes, there is Y2K problem, but it would never create global disasters as promised by many ""experts""; first of all ones, who are financially depends on a existence of such image: computer consultants working on this problem (well, I am computer consultant too, I see that around me) Using such things like Y2K or asteroiuds disaster often just a way of marketing - create a lot of noise, make a movie, make money on souveniers and forget about forever like nothing happened... Using false statements to stress good ideas does not make the case stronger."
5,Excellent introduction to the enormity of y2k,"How to talk to other people about y2k is a problem, as so often the response is denial. I've been giving those I love this book (I ordered in bulk). I've been getting good feedback. The emphasis is on connecting with what's really important in our lives, with our deepest values and with each other. As several articles stress, getting to know your neighbors may be the most important thing you do. The book prepares us for the kind of change in the way we view the world and our place in it. Change is always scary, but the way these potential upheavals are presented gives us a sense of being part of something exciting and spiritually uplifting"
1,Fear and misunderstanding of technology = holistic nonsense,"Yet another fear-driven marketing ploy by people who do not understand computers, or Y2K. Global famine and electricity loss? Just reset the clock on the computer to 1999 if you think that will happen and look for your spirituality elsewhere."
1,This book is a definite New-Age point of view.,"The articles contained in Awakening:The upside of Y2k are uplifting, encouraging hope and possibility of inner growth toward a god that is nebulous and unknown and brought down to the human level. If this is the way you view God, then you will love this book. Otherwise you may find hope through more of a fact rather than feeling based information source."
3,NOT TO BAD,"WELL POISON ALWAYS PUTS ON A GOOD LIVE SHOW AND REAL GOOD PARTY MUSIC. THIS IS ALBUM WASN'T BAD BUT IT HAS SOME REAL TACKY SONG WRITING ON IT. IF YOU LIKE THE BAND, BUY IT FOR YOUR COLLECTION, BUT DON'T EXPECT IT TO BLOW U AWAY."
1,WHAT ???,"I was Poison's biggest fan for many many years. I took my lumps for loving them, and WAS proud to be a Poison fan. They could do no wrong until now. This poorly produced, lackadaisical effort called ""Hollywierd"" I waited for two years for this album. I like to think of myself with ears for talent and this album lacks it. Being a musician you know what is good and bad, even if it's your favorite and folks this is bad, lyrics, music, album cover, etc. I checked out some Crack a Smile songs for the first time today, and I hate to say it but the Ritchie Kotzen days were much more creative efforts. Native Tongue and Crack a Smile showed the talent we all thought Poison lacked and are unique in their ways. I hate that Poison missed such a good oportunity to evolve and prove they are forces in this new era of music. But they didn't. So I will go home and jam on their older stuff and think of what might have been."
2,Long Awaited Let Down,"Imagine my excitement on hearing Poison were releasing a new album. Imagine my disappointment when I heard it! Ive been a hugh Poison fan since I was 15 and here we are 14 years later, this time with 2 tracks from C.C. Nooooooo please leave the singing to Bret! The only song worth listening to is Shooting Star. Sorry to be so harsh but I feel no effort was made when they were writing these songs. I hope they take a little more time when producing the next album. Sorry guys."
5,Poison's Best CD EVER!!!!!!!,"Poison has just released their best CD ever!!!! Hollyweird has sold-out all over IL. my home state.Bobby Dall & Rikki Rockett are the best rythm section in any band ever from any time era.Without Bobby on bass or Rikki on the drums Poison would wilt & die! Me personally being a bass player of a band realizes how important it is for the bass player & drummer to click! Bobby & Rikki are the back-bone of Poison along with C.C.'s very much improved guitar playing & Bret's crazy & wild,party vocals Poisonin my mind has become legandary! Hollyweird is Poison's best CD!..."
3,Not very good,"Man after all this time I was hoping their writing was still good. But the songs in this record are really poor. It's clear that Bret Michaels saved the good songs for his solo album, specially after listening to Raine, which is one of the coolset songs I've heard in a while.It could have been better."
1,An embarrassment to the Poison name,"This is the worst album I have heard in a long, long time. It is totally flat and uninspired. I listed to it once, and that was too many times. Buy ""Crack A Smile"" instead if you want some new Poison. Avoid this one like the plague."
4,Poison still rocks!!!,"I have to admit, the first time I listened to Hollyweird I wasn't too sure about it, but since that first time I just love [it!!!] C.C.'s version of Home is one of the many highlights on this cd. If I had to pick one song that would be my favorite (and believe me, it's hard to do) it would have to be Shooting Star (this is a CLASSIC Poison [song!!!]) All of the songs on Hollyweird are great!! Bret, Rikki,Bobby & C.C. are still rocking...Ithink any Poison fan should definitely add Hollyweird to their collection!!"
1,avoid this album like the plague...,"I have been a fan of poison since the ""Look What The Cat Dragged In"" era, and this is the *worst* album they've ever produced. It sounds as if they're trying for the old slam-bang-glam roots of the 80's, and they're slipping very very far. Every album up to this point has been a solid, hard rocking good time, but this one... save your money and wait for the next release."
2,Going through the motions,"Simply put, this is a very weak CD. I agree with Johnny Outlaw's review of May 23rd in that this Poison effort is for dedicated fans only and that everyone else should buy some other Poison product.I don't know what went wrong with ""Hollywierd"" but to me the performances aside from CC Deville's are phoned in leaving a CD that is flat and uninspired. The listener should be very grateful for CC's role in this CD as it is the saves the day giving it the only excitement to be found.The single ""Squeeze Box"" sounds like a demo tape being shipped around to record companies hoping the group can get a contract. If you want to hear the true version of ""Squeeze Box"" listen to the Who's rendition.Poison is these days a nostalgia act touring the country in the summer playing the hits and there is nothing wrong with that. But getting a glimpse of the band and their lasting appeal can be better found at a summer concert or a CD aside from this one."
4,"Hollyweird, a return to classic Poison","I've been a Poison fan since the beginning although I must admit that I didn't really care for ""Native Tongue"" or ""Crack a Smile"".This album is a return to the classic sound that made Poison great with a catchy blend of sex, drugs, and rock & roll. It picks up where the new tracks in ""Power to the People"" left off and has a similar sound to their ""Flesh & Blood"" album. Each time I listen to this one, I like it more. The songs are all new and are the catchy kind that you find yourself singing in your head while standing in the shower, walking to down the street, or upon waking up in the morning. For those who have followed CC's band, Samantha 7, CC sings three tracks on this album that you're sure to love. Overall, this is an album is one you can be proud to add to your collection whether you're a closet Poison fan or someone who faithfully attends their concerts year after year."
1,please,this cd is a joke. there is not one good song on this cd. if you like poison just get there greatest hits cd. stay away from this one.
2,A Real Review,"This album is a real dissapointment. It doesn't really seem like Bret put much of an effort into writing this album. Which is really sad because this was the first new release with CC since Flesh N' Blood. The songs are all very generic and show no growth. I personally enjoyed the growth they displayed on Native Tounge and Crack A Smile. For me there is not much memorable on this album. Its very cliche. Missing are any ballads whatsoever. This is a band that has written some of the best, but for some reason did not include one on here. CC's songs are ok, but it seams to me that the only way he would do this CD is if he could sing on a few songs. To me, its not really Poison."
1,An embarrassment to the Poison name,"This is the worst album I have heard in a long, long time. It is totally flat and uninspired. I listed to it once, and that was too many times. Buy Crack A Smile instead if you want some new Poison. Avoid this one like the plague."
2,Bland !,"Sorry everybody, but I have to quote the BARENAKED LADIES and say IT'S ALL BEEN DONE! Nothing new to hear, please move along to FLESH AND BLOOD, CRACK A SMILE or NATIVE TONGUE! Better yet, go see them live!"
3,TOO BAD,"Let me put it this way. This should have been a huge album (the return of C.C.), but the production and mostly ""cheesy"" songs make this a dud. I love Poison and I love 80s hair rock, but more time should have been put into this release. Hollyweird, Wishful Thinkin', and Get 'Ya Some save it. I'm hopin' for another record like Native Tongue for the next release....come on guys!!!!!!!!!"
1,Blah,"Absolutely Awful!!! They just don't sound like they have it together. Brett sounds shakey and uninspired. All the tracks sound the same. Check out Def Leppards new one, Jack Russell Aug 6th and soon Bounce by Bon Jovi if you are into great music!!!"
4,"Good, but not even close to David Lee Roth","I bought this album as soon as it hit the shelves. It sounds like the ""same old same old"" Poison that we're used to, which is a good thing. They're a group of 4 guys doing what they do best and not trying to impress the younger audience. This CD, quite frankly, is for the people trapped in the 80's genre. Like the title of this review says, it a good all around CD but if you're looking for top notch rock music, your better off buying music by David Lee Roth!!!"
2,"Wait a minute Bret, there's something I wanna say","I've been listening to Poison for years and this is definitely their worst effort yet. Aside from the title track, Shooting Star (AKA Fallen Angel reworked), Rockstar and the stuff that CC sings on this is rubbish. Its completely formulated and sounds like no effort was put it to write some decent songs, merely a collection of left-overs. Some of the lyrics are embarrassing too! Its a major let down as I liked the studio tracks on Power.. and some of A Letter soundtrack. Finally, there are no ballads which is unusual for Poison.If you're a Poison fan you should still buy it, especially if you're in the UK then maybe we might get another tour which would be cool (provided they don't play anything of this!)"
2,We waited 12 yrs to hear this?,"Poison had a cheesy image but made awesome albums ... this album is ruined from c.c's stupid,annoying voice and the production isnt great. maybe two great songs here remind me of older albums but bret cant sing anymore and these guy's couldve put more effort since they had some many years to do so."
3,"Crack a Smile should have been their ""comeback"" album...","""Crack a Smile"" is a flat out great rock n' roll, tongue in cheek, feel good album...it's a shame it didn't get a push from the label or the band. This new album is full of the familiar (and much needed) Poison rock n' roll...but the production is slightly sub-par. CC is the guitar player..if he insists in singing, get Blues back in the band and do another album as good as CAS. By the way, these guys still KILL in concert...but hopefully they'll play longer next time out and change up their set some."
4,Welcome to Hollyweird!,"At first I didn't like this CD one bit. Basically Bret's voice was throwing me off. The basic sound was totally different than what I remembered from this band... but I got used to it. The lyrics are first rate, but I would have liked to hear Bret kick it up a notch. Bret, Bobby, CC and Ricki are awsome. I really look forward to more great things from them!"
4,Better then expected.,"Hello, I want to tell all you 80's pop metal fans Poison has grown up and put out a very strong and satisfying record. I believe by far best album since their debut.I feel some of the strongest tracks let C.C. Deville take control. Do not let the old label hair band scare you, this is a great rock n roll record with power."
4,Poison Returns!!!!!!!!!!!,"If Poison has ever had a better chance for a full comeback (mainstream radio,mtv,vh1) this is it!! It sounds like classic energized Poison. It has a more updated sound though,kind of edgy like Tearin' Down The Walls or Ball and Chain. The stand outs are ""Stupid,Stoned,and Dumb"" which could be a hit on pop or rock radio the chorus is as infectious as any Poison tune!! ""Shooting Star"" is kind of a modern day Fallen Angel, ""Devil Woman"",""Get Ya' Some"",""Wishful' Thinkin',""Shooting Star"" all could be AOR Hits if rock radio decides its time to finally give Poison the'yre props!!!!! ""Rock Star"" is pretty good also! 4 out of 5 isn't bad,it would have been 5 out of 5 if Bret would have wrote just one ballad for the cd like ""Every Rose.."" or ""Something To Believe In"" or even ""The Last Song"""
4,!! A welcome return from the masters of glam :) !!,"At a time when there are few, if any, really good rock records on the store shelves what a welcome surprise to hear Poison was releasing a new CD. Imagine what a gas gas gas it was to listen to the CD and welcome back the baddest of the bad, the glamiest of the glam.....POISON. From start to finish a really good rocking CD that sounds like exactly what you would expect from Poison. The whole band is playing at the peak of their abilities and have never sounded better. Will this CD go down asone of the greatest of all time....probably not...will it be a pary favorite for years to come....probably so. ROCK ON.D. B. Sciotto"
4,Bring back the 80's,"Poison's new CD brings back the 80's in a big way. Thier new CD ""Hollyweird"" brings the sound of ""Look What The Cat Dragged In"" and ""Open Up and Say Ahh.."" together. If you are a Poison fan, you will enjoy this CD."
1,oh no!,"OK Poison fans you have to admit this is by far their worst album ever. Even the live album was better. If you're just getting into Poison buy one of their other albums any of them are light years better. CC you need to learn some new licks dude and let Bret stick to the vocal duties. Buy ""Crack a Smile"" baybee!"
4,Rock and Roll in the true sense of the word,"This is truly classic Poison. If you loved the Poison sound of the 80's and you want more of the same kind of feel good rock and roll, then this CD will not disappoint you. It took me back to the the early days of Poison the minute I popped it into my CD player."
3,"CD okay, but the concert was great","I just saw the Hollyweird concert, where there were Faster Pussycat, Winger, Cinderella, and Poison. I must say that I wasn't expecting much from that concert, but I was pleasantly surprised. Poison rocked the Blossom Ampitheatre in Cleveland, and played 100 minutes to a standing crowd, from beginning to end. The concert was so good, that I went out to buy the album. Unfortunately, they sounded about 10x better in concert."
3,Like the last 13 years never happened!,"Not a bad record at all ... hey, if you like Poison, you're gonna love this! Sounds like vintage late-80's-era Poison, right down to the cliched, over-the-top lyrics and tasty, catchy guitar riffs (many of which sound VERY familiar). Good, catchy, feel-good rock 'n' roll, although I want to SCREAM everytime I hear Bret say something like, ""C.C., play that thing"" or ""Mr. Rockett give me some drums."" Basically, he sounds like he's trying WAY too hard. The three songs that C.C. sings on are GREAT -- super tasty power pop that doesn't sound dated, retro, or tired at all -- definitely the unexpected highlights of the record, although I suspect 90% of Poison fans will disagree with me. His voice is snotty and nasally, but I like it, and it's a nice antidote to Bret's egomaniacal posturing (which I like for the most part, it just wears thin for a whole album.) Overall, a pretty fine comeback record."
5,This is true poison,"I have been a poison fan since the begining. This album captures the true spirit of poison. Fast times and hard living. If you love vintage poison this is up your alley, get it."
1,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!!!!!!!,"This is the weakest album I've ever heard. I was very upset when I bought it. In fact I want a refund. Special Ed is one of my favorite emcees ever, but this album makes me lose all respect for him as an artist. I hope he releases something better than, ""Revelations"", because this would tarnish an exceptional emcee's reputation. Sorry Ed, but this is far from the work I heard early in your career."
3,Decent Introduction to Apologetics,"Ronald H. Nash comes across as someone who is a lot smarter than he's letting himself seem. I haven't read his other books, but I imagine they must be more philosophical and aimed at a more educated audience than is ""Worldviews in Conflict.""This is a problem. There's nothing necessarily wrong with popular-level apologetics books--I enjoyed Lee Strobel's ""Case for Christ"" and ""Case for Faith,"" for example--as long as the author is comfortable writing in this style. Nash can't seem to decide who he's writing for.Still, if this is your first experience with naturalism, the New Age movement, and terms like ""epistemology"" and ""world view,"" I imagine that ""Worldviews in Conflict"" is as good a place to start as any. It's not Nash's fault I've heard this all before. I don't think I'm his target audience anyway."
3,Prepare to repair...,"I saw these in a catalog and was curious about it myself:) I didn't have a gift for my 12 yr old niece's birthday so I gave these. (My impression is they are for a younger kids).As other reviewers said, the cubes fall apart easy (some fell from the kitchen table to linoleum floor and would break open). My 15 yr old nephew wanted some for himself! (so there goes my idea of them being for younger kids). There isn't really enough in one box for two older kids to share."
1,Your supposed to use these to tell time!,"Discovered the danger of buying a wristwatch on-line. The design of this watch is pathetic. The hour and minute hands are styled virtually the same as the hour markings on the watch face, same colors and metals. You have to stare at the darn thing for a long time to discern the time. Strangely the second hand is colored in yellow which makes it the only think that is easy to see, I guess that's great if your timing something but heck I just want to be able to use this thing to tell time, not so good for that!"
4,A Sweet Story,This is a wonderful story about how a child can be so loved and welcomed into a family. I have two adopted children ages 3 & 4 and they went to this book repeatedly. We got it from lib. and now lookig for a copy for our own. It is a great book
4,Honest,I read this book as an adult adoptee as well as her adult books. It is an honest book about adoption written by another adoptee.
4,I now have the compact disc format of this cd. I can live :),"For years I was wondering when Polygram/Motown was going to release this soundtrack in compact disc format so I could add it as a permanent fixture to my music collection. Even as a young boy just budding into adolescence when it was first released in 1975, I have always thoroughly enjoyed the music on this album. The easy listening instrumental tracks fast and slow are appropriate for any occasion. I love the melodic and highly emotional, instrumental charged highs and lows of ""My Hero is A Gun"" and of course Diana's warm velvety fluidity on the title track one never gets tired of. It's too bad that today her voice has deteriorated so much. Michael Masser certainly displays his expertise on this album. Just a few questions for Motown. What took you guys so long to re-release this? Are you guys on crack? Do you know that some cd's in similar genres like Diana Ross and the Supremes CD's are selling on auction for $40.00 a pop??"
3,"Diana, What Were You Thinking?","Diana Ross' excellent career has been inspired by wonderful music. Some of her works including Lady Sings The Blues, Diana (1980), The Boss, and Touch Me In The Morning were some of her successful works from 1972-1980. When Motown released this abum in 1975, it was coming to be an instrumental album, which only included one hit, Do You Know Were You're Going To. Originally, Ross wanted to record an R&B album, but when the movie was flimed, it seemed to fail until 1976, when she released her second self-titled album. This was one of her most colorful, creative, and expressive works ever. The most disappointing thing about this album are the instrumentals but the Diana Ross track is essential."
2,misleading,"The title is fulfilled in only the first two chapters or so. The rest of the book is management advice, which is decent advice (listen to your customer, etc), but I've read it elsewhere. I wanted to read what the title promised. Only happened on a minority of the pages. Disappointing."
5,Change is great!,"From beginning to end this is a terriffic CD. Starting off with ""Goodbye to Hello"" a quirky song about missing their spouses and ending with ""Ride"" a song about taking the best and forgetting the worst in life, this CD is probably the best one I own. I bought it the day it came out and it has not left the rotation in my CD player since, I recommend the sentimental ballad ""What I Did Right"" and the repentant ""I Need to Be Wrong Again"" to anyone thinking of purchasing this disc. Fabulous! There is no other way to describe it."
3,Great Expectations,"I rushed out to buy this cd with great expectations. Whatever Comes First is one of my favorites. Goodbye to Hello is a really strong start and Albuquerque is one of my favorites on the cd. What is really missing is overall quality. I really cannot find a ""bad"" song, but the first cd had much stronger songs. One of the things I really liked about Whatever Comes First was that every song was a good song by itself. Goodbye to Hello, Albuquerque, and Change really fit that mold. Everybody's Gotta Grow Up Sometime is really clever and I Need To Be Wrong Again has potential, but the cd just doesn't have that listen to it so many times you would wear it out quality. I would definately recommend the cd if you are a fan, but do not judge the group without listening to Whatever Comes First."
2,Tuneful but banal American country pop,The songs are well sung but the band need to hire another songwriter! The tunes are unmemorable and the lyrics often trite (Hands up who is interested in a song apparently inspired by the sight of the songwriter's girfriend painting her toenails!) Fine as background musical wallpaper but if you like your country challenging look elsewhere. Disappointing after the hype. Definitely not one for fans of Steve Earle.
1,not recommended,"Sorry, but I can't recommend her books to any serious trader or student of trading; her books have been criticized for their cotton candy, hurah hurah motivational type writing which, frankly, is irritating after the 5th page, while at the same time, lacking any credible, scientific, and meaningful strategies for making money in the stock market. This one appears to be just a rehash of the earlier ones, written in a more 'textual' type format. If you want a decent introduction to trading, try Link's High Probability Trading or Markham's Swing Trading. For more critique of Turner, see my review on her Day Trading book. Good luck aspiring traders everywhere."
3,I might have expected as much,"If you were a Pixies fan back in the day, there is nothing new here. It all plays out exactly the way it did when Doolittle came out. The author tells of a quick road trip he takes with Black as they reminisce about this album that teens just loved to use as a parent torture device. I can still remember my mom yelling up at me, ""What was that about a tattooed something? It better not be what I thought I heard!""During the brief drive, we can all exhale with relief to find that Frank Black is still the same ego-driven, immature, self-described genius he was so long ago. He hasn't changed. People remain both fascinated and repelled by his audacity and perversion. Only now that car isn't cool anymore. It's just an old gas guzzler with no airbags except the one driving."
5,An Honest Voice Amidst the Lies,"""Wreckage"" mirrors Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" in its form: underworld, middle world, upper world, with an additional twist: ""the Beggar: Between 2 Worlds."" This is an astonishing book for its brutal honesty. Part I (""Underworld"") examines in great detail the poet's own underworld, dominated by self-hatred. All of us have an underworld, mostly unexamined therefore in control. Hawk has examined his own underworld in minute detail and, like Tiresias in Dante, lived to tell us about it. DO NOT miss this one, it is the best thing in American poetry, the ""...thinking man's Bukowski,"" as one critic notes--think about that one for awhile. Finally, there is Hawk's mastery of form; he breaks new ground with the sonnet: ""He is doing things with the sonnet no one else has done,"" says Coleman Barks, who should know."
2,I was expecting more...and I'm a native Spanish speaker,"I own the Russian Grammar of this series and I absolutely love that book. I bought this one for helping my fiance to learn my language (I live in Santiago, Chile) expecting to get a very good grammar book. I was very disappointed when I flipped through the pages; although they cover mostly all the notions of Spanish grammar I found that the explanations weren't deep enough on some complicated parts of grammar, specially some verbs and usage of personal pronouns like ""lo, le, les"". I know how to speak my language of course, but if you ask me ""why is this like this way and not like this?"" I would have some trouble explaining some things and was the reason why I bought this. I guess it's ok for someone just beginning with the study of Spanish, but I believe it leaves too many things unclear making necessary to buy a better researched book if you want too deepen your understanding of Spanish grammar."
3,"Good book, but needs work.","I think after a few more revisions this book will be a great study aid or refresher for those of us studying Spanish. Right now, the exercises are not thorough. If you are self-teaching yourself Spanish you will need more practice than this book provides."
5,Fabuloso!!!,I was having the toughest time with the imperfect and the preterite. This book was a godsend!!!There are many great exercises for everything- I highly recommend this book for the 'bumpy' parts of Spanish grammar.
2,Depends on what you're looking for,"To be fair, I was looking for a book to help me with conversational Spanish. This book seems geared more for passing a school course than for learning some quick and useful conversational Spanish. I was looking for a fun way to learn. This is not it."
1,This is a lausy excuse for a book!,Classical example of how thw book shouldn't be written.I'm sorry for every cent I have spent on this publication!
5,Move over Wild Blood... Walking Wolf is a better book..,"A surprisingly great book with very few downfalls. The life of Bill Skillet (Vargr) is one adventure after another... It hard to believe all he has went through in his short pretender life. I enjoyed this book a great deal more that Wild Blood. The charters and descriptions of the events around the storyline were much more interesting and entertaining. The two downfall of the book: 1. Might of had a little to much Indian history in it. 2. Book was to short.(only 181 pages). I could of read 300 pages or another book on Walking Wolf. Would highly suggest this to any fan on Horror, Werewolves, or Vampires. Give it a 5......"
5,WONDERFUL !,"Thank the Lord for liquid Ivory hand soap -- a fragrance-free, mild, liquid hand soap that isn't contributing to new strains of super resistant bacteria!WHY DON'T THE STORES CARRY IVORY LIQUID HAND SOAP ANYMORE?I quit using liquid hand soaps because they all have awful 'anti-bacterial' ingredients which are contributing to the evolution and existence of new strains of super bacteria that are hard to kill. I've looked and looked for Ivory liquid hand soap in Target, Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, etc. and CANNOT FIND IT ANYMORE!Somebody please tell these stores to start carrying it again.In the meantime, our family all use Ivory soap bars. Anybody know who carries Ivory liquid hand soap on a regular basis?"
1,Poor quality,It seems to me that this was the production of an absolute beginner.The Volcanoe Park has many things to show from erupting volcanoes to flowing lava. Nothing of this is shown in the movie.There are too many scenes showing just lava fields and some flowers or people walking on the lava.
1,Very poorly done,"I rented this to learn more about the islands,but learned nothing from this film. Video and music both are very poor quality. No real information about history,current conditions or any particular plant/wild life is given."
5,Excellent Older Pocket Pistol Guide,"This Guide is an older work that covers most of the older,low cost guns,many of which are still very popular as Pocket Pistols for everyday carry. One of the models it features is probably the most popular pocket pistol in history,""The .25 Raven.""Even though many of the newer guns are not addressed directly, the information is directly transferable. This Guide supplies information on pocket carry that is not available elsewhere.Any critiscism of this Guide seems to center around the fact it is not as big as a dictionary and it is targeted at the somewhat experienced crowd rather than being an ABC primer for the total novice."
2,Lacking in content and substance. Avoid!,"This ""book"" is more of a magazine article, and should be re-titled to indicate that it is really about an attempt to justify the low quality junk gun market. This author sings the praises of the worst pocket pistol series on the market and names the Raven/Bryco series as the only acceptable pocket pistols. None of the quality pocket pistols are even mentioned. His advice is flawed and in some cases, dangerous. As a 28 year police officer, firearms instructor, and armorer, I take issue with nearly every aspect of this flawed book. I read it cover to cover in an hour, and it is printed in large print with lots of line drawings and photos to fill space of this breif dissertation on the merits of the low quality saturday night specials that he endorses. Avoid this at all costs, not to mention the inflated purchase price of this phamphlet."
2,More of a pamphlet than a book,"I have a fair amount of experience with guns and, while I learned a little bit from the book, I don't believe it came close to justifying the expense. This book is very light on information that can't be quickly and easily found in a decent online article. In fact, I really think only about 15 of the 71 pages are worth reading. The rest of the book is filled with basic information and obvious statements. In addition, it often digresses into propagandizing and rants about gun control."
2,The worst menu system I've ever seen in an electronic device,"This was a gift, and I was happy to receive it because of the quality of the DVD's produced -- provided a high quality VHS source tape, recorded with a high quality camera, were used. But the on-screen menus are absolutely incomprehensible and even the most simple of actions are met with an inexplicable, baffling, totally maddening ""stop sign"" icon with no explanation at all of what's wrong. The most simple copy operations will get the ""stop sign"" several times in a row even when following the manual religiously and using media that works perfectly in another recorder. Conclusion -- good quality if you can ever get it to work, and that's a tall order."
1,RCA DVD Recorder/VCR DRC8320N,"I purchased this unit 15 months ago, hardly have used it in that time. Unit will not power on, company said will cost $130-150 to fix it, mail back at my expense. Wal Mart with original receipt and box will not do a thing past 90 days. I paid $172 a little over yr. ago for this unit. Manual was a nighmare trying to figure out how to set up unit.This is piece of junk, had a prior older VCR (magnavox or sony) for 18 yrs. that still worked but wanted to upgrade to DVD/VCR player recorder.Will never buy another RCA PRODUCT AGAIN."
1,Never buying anything from RCA again,"This item was replacement for a DRC8300N that was also bad. It took many months of fighting with RCA to get a replacement and I did not want this model as it also had problems on internet reports. They said to take it or leave it.The replacement DRC8320N has the 'interface error' that so many report. RCA won't answer calls or they put on hold and never return when they hear it is this model. One nice lady said they have many reports of problems and can't fix them, then she hung up.I will never buy anything again from RCA. I bought my original unit two years ago and had problems almost immediately. Since then they have just jerked me around.To be fair, the unit was fantastic in all ways when it worked. But I only got about 20 hours on the first before it died and about 30 on this one."
1,0 stars for longevity and support,"We didn't really use this much, so I was pretty surprised when it died, just 30 days short of the 1 year warranty. RCA support is a nightmare. The 866 number on the unit says they're so overloaded with calls that I should wait 3 days before calling back. I e-mailed their support, who gave me a number to call for an RMA. After waiting an hour to talk to a rep, it turned out that number didn't handle this model and he gave me (you guessed it) the original 866 number to call."
1,More junk for the consumers,"I should have known something was wrong when I saw a big stack of these at the store and none of the salespeople recommended them. I don't know if this thing actually records because it never worked. It seemed to overheat after I hit Record and shut off. In the process, it made coasters out of the discs. I did some research and these are actually manufactured by some schlock company in China. RCA just puts their name on it. I guess quality control is nonexistent. I took it back for a refund. I should write RCA and tell them to reimburse me for the discs it destroyed."
2,The VCR works great...,"WTF? If you push any button during some 'ongoing action', the disc is toast. Unplugging and re-starting is the only way. Mostly. I just love the poorly translated instructions. Old Low Norse into Chinese into American English apparently is a bad thing. I guess, ya' know, this whole technology is not done fermenting. Garbage-in = Garbage-out"
1,"Junk! If they give it away, don't take it home with you!","The firmware is toast, everytime I turn it on it wants to do the whole initialization thing, then it doesn't pick up any channels during auto-scan, it will only record to one DVD format, although the box claims many. When you get it home, and after you wade through the nearly incomprehensible user's manual, that's when you find out about the DVD format thing. This is, no doubt about it, the worst ever consumer electronics product I've ever bought. I'd send it back, but that would deprive me of the pleasure of taking a hammer to it."
3,Good information but most is stuffing,"I enjoyed the book and am embarking upon the exercises with hope, a positive attitude, and more expectation in her words than in my ability to keep to the regimen. But the book is really a pamphlet. You have to wade through local-cable-2-a.m. fodder for *literally* fifty pages before you get to a useful bit of information. This continues for another two dozen pages. Then it's back to more tree-killing fodder. Isn't there some other way to flesh out a book and sell it when your information is brief? Couldn't she include a useful FAQ of people's specific questions about the material and clarifications that she's gleaned over the decades? Getting through to the parts you need is a fairly infuriating exercise that caused my face to grimace in non-age-enhancing ways."
4,definitly works,Very happy with this book. Face looked more toned on the very first day. The only problem i had was following some of the instructions for the exercises.
3,Working Student,The authors make everything way more complicated that it has to be. I have worked side by side with project managers for a large firm and am very famailiar with PM principles and practices and yet I find that this book is extreemly difficult to digest.
1,virtually fraud,Be warned. The Office Project program advertised as included is a trial version. The ad does not say this. Now I have to turn around a buy a new program- Amazon customer service says it isn't their fault. I really needed the book and the program for a class due to start in four days. Now I'm really stuck. Amazon is even trying to get me to pay for the return shipping!
3,"Good introductory book, but impractical","This wordy book is more heavy on management than on project management because the business professors are understandably not trained in project-specific disciplines. Hence, there is inadequate coverage of how projects are actually managed, particularly costing and key contractual issues. Even on their own terrain, the business relations are mostly asserted without solid research backing (e.g. section on culture, where certain cultures are asserted to be pro-projects, but the causal links are missing). If you are looking to teach students basic PM processes, this book is worth a look as the explanation is clear. But if you are a practitioner, learn from your discipline-specific masters. So I have to knock off 2 stars for inadequate coverage, and impracticality."
1,Project management? More like project futility!,"The author is too eager to impress you with his knowledge and ability to build confusing and complex sentences. I've found I need to read a chapter several times to get anything out of it. Even after several readings, taking notes, I'm not sure what is going on. The book provides allot of chaff with very few ""Deliverables"".Unless you are already an experienced project manager looking for a new angle this one is better left on the shelf.Too bad there isn't a zero star rating, this book really deserves it..."
4,Good textbook for a novice,"It seems that many people didn't like this book, but I used it for a class on PM & found it to be pretty good. I had no prior knowledge of the field. I really liked the accompanying Student CD-ROM for study & review of the material. I used the Microsoft Project trial CD-ROM & found that extremely useful also. I would recommend it as introductory material."
3,This book can be improved,"This is a good book about project management, but it can be improved. In this day and age project management is done with computer programs. I got an A for the Project Management course, but if I go ""into trenches"", I will have to tell my boss that I don't have a slightest clue how to use even relatively simple project management computer programs like Microsoft Project.I'd dedicate a large part of the book to inform students how to use project management computer programs. When you are in the trenches, knowing all the theory about star wars does not help. You have to know how to shoot a lowly rifle.Then again, this book is not a manual for Microsoft Project. The real problem is that our colleges do not teach real world skills like using computer programs for accounting, project management, etc. After getting your MBA you might have to buy a copy of QuickBooks and learn how to use it."
3,"Great heroes, weak story","I love Rescue Heroes - they're good guys we like our kids to play with. However, I'd rather have my child play with the toys or watch a movie than read this book. It is simplistic, far below my child's listening level, without addressing issues (anger managemnet, following rules, etc) found in the movies. We've purchased and read three of these books and all were disappointing. It would be great if Rescue Heroes books came out with expanded story lines."
3,To tell the truth...,"Ok I am going to be real. The cd is AVERAGE... I was really excited about listening to this cd but I found myself skipping a lot of the songs. It has some songs that you will like but it is better to take some songs off of it and make a mixed cd with some other songs you like from different cds. The focus of her cd is lifestyle and situations you go through and she does an OK job at it... not extremely good and not bad at all but OK!!!I believe people that think her cd is great would appreciate Shei Atkins "" life In Stereo' Much more."
4,Not bad...,"I liked this CD. With some help from Tonex and other producers, Surel put together some real jazzy cuts. Her voice is decent, not phenomenal, BUT the smoothness of the music covers it. I enjoyed this CD. Although I'm not usually into ""remakes"" or covers of secular songs into Christian, I thought it was kinda interesting the way she did ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone."" I also love ""Looked Beyond My Faults,"" and ""Eyes."" I thought the slower songs were best. On the negative, her faster cuts were just ok to me, and this one kind of fell into the ""too many songs sound the same"" ditch, but only a little. Overall, it's good listening, and anything for Christ is something to take a listen to! :)"
4,Superb Commentary,"This is an excellent, succinct and accurate commentary on John. It is scholarly but written in a way that it is accessible at every level of theological understanding, from the new Christian to the scholar."
3,"Excellent product, inaccurate AMAZON description","I've used Kerlix for all my medical trauma needs and the product, while pricey, is well worth purchasing in bulk (cheaper that way). While I would not use this directly on a wound (it adheres to the skin and is difficult to remove unless moistened with some type of sterile liquid like normal saline) it's efficient and perfect for wrapping and protecting an open-skin type of injury.My only concern is Amazon is describing the product inaccurately and consumers should read the full description as well as the sizes, length and ply to determine which type meets their need. I purchased this item when it was listed as Kerlix Sterile 6 Ply Gauze Bandage Rolls, 4.5"" x 4.1 yards, 60/Cs stored in separate sterile pouches. It has now been changed (due to my complaint) to Kerlix Sterile 8 Ply - 4.5 in x 3.1 yd, 60/Cs in sterile rigid plastic tray. Make sure to check ALL descriptions before final purchase!"
2,only to be used over other gauze.,"make sure you have something against your skin before using this. i used it for a burn, but then realized the fabric is way to rough. make sure you cover your injury first with something else before wrapping yourself with this. it's scratchy and itchy."
2,Too Long!,I bought this video to show to my history class. Not only is it too long but it has too much extraneous fluff that distracts from the essential facts. Needs a good editor and an historian to help edit out the unnecessary length.
4,White Cro Magnons?,"Modern man springing out of Africa would take tens of thousands of years to morph into the different races of the world today. Yet, in this show, the clans that moved from Africa to Europe turned white as soon as they crossed the border! Noses got big pretty quickly, too... and did I see a blue-eyed blonde amongst the new arrivals? Plus, it seems they grew from bushmen to basketball players overnight - wonder who made that call?"
5,Elevators on the way Up,"This seminal album suffers from poor original recording masters whose lack of quality should not be allowed to detract from the quality of the music itself. Created at a time when the only technology aside from amplifiers was fuzztone, Roky's insitefull poetry and cosmic imagery was transcendental at the time and remains so. Avoid the compilation and get their two best: Easter Everywhere and Psychedelic Sounds. For a great compilation recorded with todays tecnnology seek Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye, A tribute to Rocky Erickson with 13th Floor Elevator songs by ZZ Top, R.E.M.,The Jesus and Mary Chain, Butthole Surfers, and others."
5,absolutely the past.,"if you want a good sample of the 13th floor elevators this is the one to get. there are songs from each of their original albums and you'll want to hear more. the guitars of the sixties have a special ring to them, reminiscent of groups like the yardbirds,and definitely bring back old memories. this cd has sparked my interest in hearing some of roky's solo material, which i recently ordered."
4,Camping In,Camp Lo has given us another side of rap. With Uptown Saturday Night they have given us a old school flavor. I've never seen anything like it and that's what makes them wonderful at this rap game! With songs like Cooley High that have that slow groove and other variety songs your sure to pop Camp Lo in your c.d. and tape decks!
4,Tight,"I bought this album back in 97 and thought it was tight. I listen to now and still think its tight. Uptown Saturday Night was and still is one of the most underrated albums in rap, what you need to do is buy this album."
5,Very original hiphop,"I simply loved this album. The production is well put together. What really makes Camp Lo is their image and originality not their old school type lyrics. The fact that their style is based on old school is actually quite a change from all of these ""new age"" commercial rappers. Its nice to see something different for a change. If you havent gotten this album (which you should have had for about 3 years now), then get this. This album is something real hiphop heads can feel and at the same time people who are just into commercial rap will also feel this album. Its a little something for everyone who is into hiphop of all kinds."
5,Essential Album,"I remember the first time I heard Luchini - couldn't get it out of my head. It was a couple years later that I heard the other cuts on the album, and knew I had to get it. Fortunately, this record is still from the days when artists put together a whole album, from beginning to end, not just a bunch of random singles for independent download. Recommendation: Buy the album and listen from beginning to end; repeat."
5,dem boyz iz tyte,"listen close for those who cant here what there saying. there style is there own, lirics off da hook. there beats off da hook there lp iz a classic pick it up peep close da boyz iz bad cant wait for there next one if camp lo sees this, five mics, and hit me wit another"
4,Nice,This is really a great album. I like that B-side track every since I heard it on a mix tape in 96. These guys need more play.
4,Is exactly what I needed for my air perifier.,This is wonderul seems to be doing a great job cleaning my air I have this in the kitchen were my husband smokes and I putin the cleaner about a week ago and I can already see it picking up gunk.
5,Excellent review,"This book has a lot of important information that anyone taking the USLME should know. It has pretty good questions and answers and I like how the book explains the various USMLE topics. It's much easier reading through this book then some long textbooks. However, I also used the following which is also available on amazon.com:Microbiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers by Patrick LeonardiThis questions were on target with the type of questions asked on the microbiology section of the boards. Get both books."
5,Interesting and Educational,[[ASIN:006445083X My Five Senses (Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science 1)]My 4.5 year old pre-kindergarten girls loved this book. It was a great compliment to the week they spent exploring the five senses at school. I can see using this book repeatedly for several years to come.
5,"Simply written, beautifully illustrated.","This is a wonderful book for beginning readers that will introduce then to the concept of our five senses and how they make us aware of the world around us when used one at a time or in combinations.Scientific concepts are simply explained for kindergarten or preschool children, who will most certainly be entranced by the lively illustrations."
4,Good addition to your hair clipping arsenal,"For those who want to just trim the crown, this is the combo to buy. Only gave it a 4 rating since the #12 attachment really flexes and can cut shorter than expected, so don't apply too much pressure like you do with shorter attachments. The #10 flexes as well, but not nearly as much. BOTH, however, fit a bit loose on the clipper so they rattle a bit (specially the #12)--sticking some tape on the attachment fixes this rattle. Overall, still very usable and you don't have to get a crew cut every time. It still beats having to pay for a cut at the barbers."
3,Wahl Clipper Attachments #12 And #10 Guide Combs With Flat Top Comb,plastic is thin and flimsy. just have to be careful not to apply too much pressure on it while cutting. otherwise the fingers bend a little.
2,Over $8.00 shipping? Why!!!,"Note: shipping for Chrome Pro Kit from Amazon is cheap a really good buy! But these 2 extra long attachments(#10,#12) you order from a different place is NOT! the box was very light but cost over $8.00 to ship a less then $10.00 item. it was so light you know most of the over $8.00 shipping is just profit. Most things that light cost $3.00 to ship here.Total cost for the 2 extra long attachments was 18.68 for very light flimsy pieces of plastic! - that i found out i did not need. I think you will find as i did, that the one inch attachment that comes with the Clipper kit is plenty long! - And you can make it even longer if you tilt it upward! Or tape something to the back of the bottom of it and make it any height you want!!"
4,"Buy it from your local Beauty Supply store, the shipping is not worth it","Buy it from your local Beauty Supply store, the shipping on here is not worth it. I found mine at the local ""Sally beauty supply store"". The product itself is satisfactory. I only gave it 4 stars because the $10 shipping is ridiculous."
4,Works fine for me,As others have said the guides did fit a bit loose on my clippers but it did not affect the performance. I ran the guide gently without pushing down very hard and it did not deflect and gave an even cut. Too much pressure will cause the guides to sag. I am pleased with the guides. They completed my set nicely and give a lot more options.
4,Extra guide combs,Searched for a very long time to find just 1 or 2 combs that would keep my long haired dogs at a reasonable length; especially in the winter months. These are perfect!
4,Might as well go LED,"My application to convert a 3 light outdoor pole lamp to 12v and run it off of a landscape transformer.I already had an 120watt max transformer powering 12 10w G4 walkway lamps.So, I was faced with upgrading the converter to accommodate an additional 150 watts (3x50each).This was painful because the transformers are quite expensive.Then I realized that 12v LED bulbs were available for all of this and that the total watts with thattechnology would be well below the 120w max of my current transformer.So I replaced everything with LEDs and I think its about 30w total.That saves about $3/month in electricity. Total for the LED bulbs was about $30.So I never used these 12v incandescent bulbs.The quality of light of the 12v incandescent than the E27 LED bulbs I found.I'm very happy with the G4s I found which were about 2.5watts."
3,broken bulbs,"Of the six bulbs I ordered, four worked and one was broken on arrival and one didn't work at all. For me to just pack up the two items and pay postage and gas to post office, I would say it would be more expensive to do that than just take the loss. I am sure it wasn't the companys fault for the broken bulbs. Otherwise, the four other bulbs work great."
5,"MT ST. Helens: Back From The Dead, Helps answer lots of questions I've had.","This movie has enlightened me and will be lots of help as I travel to Washington, Oregon area to see It first hand"
4,Mount St. Helen,Bought the DVD just before going to see Mount St. Helen. Made the visit to the real thing more meaningful.
5,amazing,"Don't have the cd yet, but I'm going to pick it uo at the local store soon. I attended his concert last night at sculler's jazz club and it was one of the best shows I've seen. I've seen him twice, the Sonic Trance concert was definitely the best out fo the two. What I have heard on the cd is absolutely crazy. Ridonculous."
3,Buyer beware,"This is not a bad cd, nor is it bad music. However, just a word of caution to those like myself who prefer the swingin, soulful Nick, this IS NOT JAZZ. It is great for what it is, but do not buy this CD expecting another Nick @ Night or Payton's Place. That said, enjoy."
2,Complete Soundtrack is Anything But,"After watching The Weeping Meadow I immediately ordered the ""complete soundtrack"" CD because the music is hauntingly beautiful. I play the accordion and wanted to learn the stunning accordion audition, as well as the other pieces of music played 1) in the tavern, 2) the dancehall, 3) the musicians railcar, and 4) the funeral raft. The CD contains only a number of versions of the main theme - as beautiful as that theme is - but none of the above music. And the accordion audition piece is played poorly, seemingly by a different musician. I couldn't have been more disappointed."
5,W. Carlos' Masterpiece,"Wendy Carlos (née Walter, prior to a snip from his friendly plastic surgeon) was a pioneer of digital music. Having reconstructed classics of Beethoven (used in A Clockwork Orange) and other composers, Carlos proceeded to create all-new themes for the movie TRON. To say that the result was original is an understatement.Carlos acheives amazing emotion and vibrance in a synthesized medium that, in the very early '80's, was still largely in its infancy. The main theme, so hummable that it was included in the arcade game that accompanied the movie, reappears in much of the pieces for the film, but never in a way as to sound repetitive.Carlos' work here is proof that excellent music, made with any instrument, survives the test of time and wears well on the careful listener."
4,"Excellent Music, Just Not the First Song","All the songs are great except for the first one because it sounds like somebody about to die. Even though that's the plot of the movie, it still sucks! I'm surprised that Jeff Bridges isn't in one of the songs like ""The Grid"" song from Tron: Legacy... that was an amazing soundtrack also with all the songs being great! This is still a classic, by the way. This is more arcade-like than the second movie's album, it's probably because it's focused on arcade games rather than saving your one and only dad in the world. Also Wendy Carlos was an amazing figure throughout this album's work... 5 frickin' stars!"
3,Weird And A Little Over the Top,"I listen to this soundtrack often but the keyboard music is both repetitive and annoying after awhile. I really liked the movie so that helps, however it could do without the song by Journey."
4,Pretty good,"Call me what you will, but I only bought this since I was a fan of the original movie, and bought the soundtrack to the new movie as well. The soundtrack is decent in its own right, but not the best thing I've ever heard. It does, however, fit the movie. And it does make for good music if you really think about it. I think if you are a fan of the movie, you will like this. If not a fan, or maybe merely a casual fan, you may not appreciate it for what it was intended to be."
5,Awesome series,This is a fantastic series! Such a compelling story and interesting characters. Mind blowing! I highly recommend it to anyone
5,Highly reccomended,"This anime is one of the best ive seen. With the idea of rational thinkin, contractors, and stylish action, I'd say its one of the must watch animes in awhile. But the problem is that I havent found the HD blueray type version yet :/"
1,These companies are trying to rape you!,"Although this anime is one of my top three favorites of all time, I would NEVER pay that much for a blu ray set. It better be made of GOLD for that much. Idiots. I hope the BK-201 comes and shocks some sense I to these guys! MAYBE IF YOU push the decimal forward one, you sell them! ($125-150) that makes more sense."
1,You're out of your damn mind,"I don't think any one is going to pay $1,555 for a damn blu ray box set even if its importedfrom Japan. I'd rather wait for Funimation to release their own blu ray box of it. Hell youcan get the dvd set for $30. As much as I like Darker Than Black, I think $1000 bucks for someblu ray set is outrageous. I could think of much better things to spend $1,555 bucks on like acar payment or bills for that matter! Or hell more anime. Seriously, $1,555 bucks? You can keepit."
5,Incredible,"This is, and has been my favorite anime for quite some time now. The story revolves around a world filled with ""contractors"" who are basically humans that have gained mysterious powers because of the sudden appearance of Heaven's Gate and also Hell's Gate (chaotic areas of space that appeared in both South America and Japan). For the most part this is a very serious show, but there is still some humor mixed in with it."
5,You don't need to Geass me to watch it! I'd watch it of my own free will!,"Okay, not as good as Code Geass. Only a few animes could EVER beat it. But Darker Than Black is a great anime with awesome plot twists and an excellent story line. DTB puts forth the question: ""Does the fiber of your being make you who you are?"" Hei is a Contractor, a being that is meant to lie, kill and do whatever it takes to get whet he wants. But Hei has other things in mind. Does he kill simply because he's made to, or does he hold off unless its necessary? What does Hei desire and does he need to kill to get it? What does it mean to be a born-killer and try to deny what you are for the sake of what you hold dear? This anime asks these questions and more. 5/5 for being a truly awesome representation of what it means to live your life as you WANT, not how people think you're MEANT to live it!I can't wait for Season 2!"
3,Interesting plot,"This is the first time I watched an anime with this type of storyline. It's sort of similar to X-Men where some people have powers and some don't. If you recall in X-Men, the mutants were isolated and feared among. Well, it's the same with Darker Than Black. Except it's about something falling from the sky that caused some humans to obtain a certain power, but with each power, there is a price that needs to be paid each time it is used. There is a total of 3 seasons (from what I've been told), but so far, I've only seen two. Season 2 is ok. It's not bad, but it could've been better...and longer. It's only 12 episodes compare to the first season, which has 26."
2,Dissappointing,"It could have been better. How about just categorizing one particular part on each book on the series, instead of having a little of this and a little of that?"
3,Decent Trek,"Timetrap is a traditional Trek novel, decently written and with a story that holds the interest but does not excite. Captain Kirk is a little too maudlin here, but nevertheless gets plenty of alien female action (and would we expect anything less?) as he finds himself isolated from the Enterprise and surrounded by ""New Klingons."" There is some good McCoy/Spock banter here, but the rest of the crew is limited to cameos (and Chekov, although mentioned, never appears at all). Bottom line is that Timetrap is a good, quality Trek read, not as outstanding as The Captain's Table's Fire Ship, but by no means a dud."
3,How do you like your Klingons?,"Do you prefer your Klingons devious, underhanded, implacable enemies of the Federation, as they are in ""Trouble With Tribbles"" and ""Friday's Child""? Or do you prefer the honorable and rather straightforward, if harsh, warriors we saw glimpses of in ""Errand of Mercy"" and ""Day of the Dove"", and which we've seen regularly ever since Worf debuted on ""Next Generation""? If your idea of Klingons is the former, you'll doubtless enjoy this book tremendously. If the latter, I suspect that you'll find this book untenable; these are definitely not the modern idea of what Klingons are like.The story itself is a reasonably good one, if not quite as subtle as it seems to think it is. The writing is fine, the characterizations good, the plot interesting if not entirely plausible, and not just because of devious Klingons. Worth a read, but not the best ""Trek"" story out there by a long shot."
5,great memories,"This was such a fantastic book when I was a child I started searching for a copy on the internet. It would be a great read for your 4th grade (or so) aged children.Dangerous Island tells the story of three children accidentally washed out to sea on their homemade raft. They alight on a tiny rock island and survive by their wits, and are dismayed to discover the island is slowly sinking. Will they be rescued before the island totally sinks into the ocean?"
4,Great price for these wipes,These are great! My baby has never had a diaper rash and I've been using these since she was born. Granted it may be coincidence but at least it didn't upset her bottom. The only small complaint I have it that not all the wipes are the same wetness. The top wipes are drier than the bottom ones. Maybe storing them with the dispense side down before opening would help - haven't tried so it's just a hypothesis...

3,The best set of gloves I ever had.,"These gloves you should wear everywhere you go. When riding on a motorcycle, going to the movies, using for a Halloween costume. These gloves will make anyone feel like a whole new person."
3,Good Product Not A Consumer-Friendly Setup,"I purchased it for residential use. Clearly a good product, however, you'll need a networking specialist to set this up. The product did not include any instructions on how to configure. Quite complicated configuration for the average residential use."
2,its not worth it.,"i read so many articles regarding Tungsten T3 cases because i was planning to use this PDA for very long long time. i had to get appropriate 'cloth' for my companion, u see? my concerns was not really on whether a case is metallic or leather. i chose metal case because i never had one before and liked to try it.GOOD: its color matches well with the PDA and its very sturdy. there are places to put 2 SD cards. heavyBAD: hinge FALLS off so easily after couple of weeks and i could not find anyway to fix it. Also, although there are some opening spaces on bottom part of the case for synchro, i found it impossible to be charged/synched via cradle nor USB cables (to be honest, i have no idea why they even made opening there.)i personally recommend Vaja cases if u can afford one. although its very expensive brand, if u are planning to use ur pda for long long time like me, i think it is worthy."
4,Nice case,I realy like this case; my t3 fits in perfectly and still expandes up with no problem. The matte finish hide the small scraches perrty well. Only down side is that I have to take the T3 out of the case to use it on the cradle. If you're left handed the door kinda gets in the way but it works. Would recomend over PalmOne's case any day.
1,A mishmash of a neglected chapter in space exploration,"A poorly written and edited attempt to address a neglected chapter in space exploration. Much could have been written on this subject, however the authors sophomoric attempt sabotages the effort. Extensive effort was made to describe ship's and squadrons histories,(done before and far better elsewhere) Precious little is devoted to spacecraft and splashdown technology, or any of the drama or near catastrophe of the Liberty Bell and Apollo Soyuz recoveries."
3,Bulgaria in Egypt?,"I can't compete with Mr. Coulardeau's literary comment on Mozart in Egypt, which says (quote): ""... is conquered by this transmuted music that loses its classic muteness to capture a brand new eloquence and impressionistic power."" (unquote).I bought MiE / II here in Costa Rica, seeing it by chance in a library, while looking for a seafood book. Sounds interesting, I thought, since I like both Mozart and Arabic music. Sometimes these mergers work, sometimes not.My great disappointment was the quality of the remastering. The orchestra parts sound dull and without brilliance, taking out quite a bit of the fun that one has enjoying the combination of both musical styles. Was it the Bulgarian orchestra? Hmmm...Otherwise a fine piece of work with many a surprise here and there."
5,you don't have to a member of the Tea Party to like this tea,"great substitute for coffee. nice bitter taste, but smooth at the same time. love the slight buzz I get without the anxiety associated with coffee. lots of health benefits coming from the flavonoids in green tea."
5,Charming mobile,"I bought this to hang from the ceiling of a breezy (in summer) sun room. It floats around nicely, swaying and turning and is very pleasant. Even when bought as""assembled"" it is not a cinch to put together."
1,It doesn't actually charge my laptop,I am sorry to say that this is the second time I have purchased a charger to replace the one that my dog ate for my compaq R3000 laptop and both replacement ones do not charge my laptop unless I firmly hold them in place. I am going to try a universal one and keep my fingers crossed.
5,wait to go snoopy,snoopy is my favorite peanuts charecter he's done wonderful things in his life like the time he ran away or the time he joined sled dogs but he's never done something like this before first when snoopy follows a bueatiful poodle named fifi into a circus tent his life was turned around into a famous circus star then in snoopy is getting married charlie brown when snoopy falls for another poodle named johnvue he annouces that he's going to get married everybody thinks a good idea including snoopy's brother spike when spike takes a jurastic journey to see snoopy get married and he does make it and everybody is going through it but what about the bride ?
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The second volume of Swamp Thing explores the relationship between the former man, and the human woman.Holland has come to realise that he is no longer human at all, but rather vegetable, and an earth elemental. Why, then does he have an interest in a human woman at all, or go out of his way to care for her?"
3,Better Than Vol. 1,"Ok, Vol. 2 was better than Vol. 1, but it still is not worthy of 4 or 5 stars. This is just my opinion. As far as this being a great horror story, ummm hello? Yes, it was a cool story but not a great horror story. The art work is not that great either. I have read the entire Swamp Thing run by Alan Moore and this is the best of the bunch. I struggled to get through vol. 1 and the others. I read a lot of ""mature"" graphic novels, and this series just didn't impress me that much. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either."
3,Decent product for the money.,"This pneumatic cutting tool works well for the price. It doesn't exactly ""cut like a hot knife through butter"", but it does work pretty well once you get the hang of it. Additional blades can be a little pricey. I definitely recommend it if you don't have hundreds of dollars to spend on one of these."
1,Energizing Tai Chi Chi Kung,"This is an inferior product. The production is poor. Dark and hard to see, Sound of poor quality or absent. Boring instructions. This item should not even be on the market."
3,buen vendedor,todo salio como se esperaba lo recomiendo y el producto es bueno y el vendedor cumplio con la venta soy de venezuela
4,Tower Heist Instant Watch Review,"I remembered seeing the previews for this movie on TV & thinking that it was nothing special, nothing ""new""! So, when my teenage son picked it for family night I wasn't very excited. However, I am quite pleased to say that I was wrong. Though not the funniest movie I have seen it was still a very ""fun"" all around movie. Though most of this movie is obviously an attempt at humor as you would expect just by looking at the cast, there are a fair share of dramatic moments. The dramatic parts of this movie set up the comedic parts. All in all I feel this film does a great job of walking us through many different emotions. We get to be happy, sad, excited and, in the end, we can feel content that the ""BAD GUY"" gets what he deserves! Great movie, great fun! I do have one word of caution, the movie is rated PG-13 and that shouldn't be ignored. While there is no nudity or sex there is a great deal of, ""situational"" language you should be aware of, otherwise, relax and enjoy!"
3,Entertaining but Flawed,"If you can shut your brain down for a while, this is an entertaining movie. However, you really can't begin to think much at all because of the huge plot holes throughout. It is barely worth a rental and certainly not a buy. If you have a little time to kill and try not to think too hard, it can be enjoyable. They just could have done so much more with the plot and especially the cast."
3,Fun light hearted movie,"This comedy was just a fun, easy and light hearted movie to watch. Would I buy it no, but it's was fun for the night."
2,NotAMoviePerson,"okay, so I gave this movie a chance because eddie murphy was in it. but it was overly influenced by ben stiller, so it ends up being a ""classic"" ben stiller-esque movie (not a compliment) that very much a different theme/ topic but same ben stiller non-funny push to make funny- squirm in your seat because you can't believe you let yourself watch another ben stiller movie. Summary: no more ben stiller movies for me, regardless of who he managed to coax/ pay to co-star in the movie."
3,decent,"I Cant lie i expected it to be funnier, but i was fairly entertaining. This movie wasn't overly predictable or dunce funny like most comedies, so i personally thought it was a nice switch up from the regular action movies.If you already watched the trailers, you wont like it as much...Yet, if you want an entertaining movie, it's a decent buy!"
5,Very Good Movie,Loved this movie. It was exciting and very funny. Hubby and I really enjoyed it. We didn't expect to enjoy it as much as we did. A very pleasant surprise.
4,entertaining,"I really enjoyed this light hearted & fun movie, and it was good to see Alan Alda again even though he was the bad guy."
1,one-draft dud,"Even for escapist, nonsense, and formula, film is positively awful. This is why everyone in LA has written a script."
1,"More like the ""hour"" heist...","It could be retitled to the ""hour"" heist... as that is what it will waste of your time watching it. A great cast of characters thrown on the screen, shaken up and boringly paraded around. ah well..."
2,So boring that I forgot to finish it.,"This movie should have been good -- excellent cast and plot. But it's so full of details and so light on punchlines (especially compared to other Ben Stiller movies) that watching becomes unfulfilling. I paused the movie to go to the bathroom, and when I came back I started texting...three days later I realized that I didn't even watch the last 30 minutes of the movie. That's how uninteresting it is."
2,Nothing really funny,"I'll admit it, I did laugh a few times, but overall this movie is a really poor comedy. The jokes and comedic parts all feel like they are copy pasted from a bad comedian, and its story might be an original story to a degree, but it still ends up bland and has what can only be described as a lame excuse for a plot twist at the end. There is even an attempted ""love relationship"" in the movie, but it doesn't go anywhere and is completely pointless (like basically everything in the movie). This movie sucks. If I were you, I really wouldn't waste my money..."
2,This movie sucked,"Once again, Eddie Murphy must've been low on money or was low on money during the time when he made this because this movie was boring as hell and sucked big time, just like that movie, ""1000 Words,"" which highly, HIGHLY sucked, and another movie where he must've been low on cash and just decided to make a b.s. movie and say, ""hey, I know this movie's gonna suck but hell, people gonna go see it because I'm Eddie Murphy."" well, both movies are not worth the reel that they were made on. Don't waste your money ordering this movie unless you're an Eddie Murphy-fan. Gabby was the only interesting person in the movie(my opinion)."
2,Disappointed,"Don't buy,waste of money. Very disappointed in Ben Stiller, expected much more. Wasn't very funny at all.Eddie Murphy wasn't as good as he usually is either. Who wrote this? Great actors bad picture."
2,Boring..,"Not a good movie at all. Waste of money, dont buy or watch. I wish I could have 2 hours of my life back."
4,Good comedy movie with mindless entertainment,"Tower Heist is a very funny movie with good comedical actors doing very funny movie roles. The movie has many funny moments, a few slow parts in between the funny parts, but the good acting saved the movie in my viewpoint. But if your just looking for a mindless entertainment movie to waste some time one night then pick this movie up and have a few laughs here and there with the actor Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy. Plus the supporting cast made the movie even more enjoyable. So sit back and enjoy a good evening with good comedical movie."
2,Movie review.,Good first half for a summer movie. Good characters. The heist itself is simply too preposterous--EVEN for a summer escapist movie. Just wanted the last third to end.
3,Tower Heist,"This was an ok movie, slow in some parts but over all ok. Eddie Murphy was overall the best part of the movie! Should have had a bigger role!"
4,Better than expected,Better than most of the reviews would suggest. Eddie Murphy is funny asis Ben Stiller but the whole cast delivers a funny movie. Will justice prevail in the end?
4,Enjoyable,"This movie is not as bad as people are saying it is. It was actually pretty enjoyable. Good story line, great acting and few funny parts that kept us laughing (good job Eddie Murphy) My wife and I enjoyed it, we're 23 years young from NY. This is a good popcorn, rainy day type of movie."
4,Enjoyable Movie,"This movie was very enjoyable. Was very entertaining to watch, and I can't say that about too many movies anymore. Would recommend for a light, entertaining movie night."
3,ok,Just OK nothing to inspirational here. It was something to do if there is nothing else. I like romance with action
3,Expected more from this great cast,"With names like Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick, Alan Alda, Tea Leoni and a few others, you'd expect greatness. While the movie was decent, it definitely didn't live up to the hype.I first saw the trailer for this movie during the opening of another movie. I thought it looked good and sounded interesting, so I made a mental note to watch it when it came out on DVD. As luck would have it, my local library had a copy begging to be reserved. I grabbed it and popped it in ready for excitement. While there were a few moments on edge-of-your seat thrill, there weren't many. Maybe the jokes made up for it? Let me put it this way, my wife turned to me when the movie was roughly half over and said ""I thought you said this was supposed to be a comedy?"" Ouch.It is a decent movie that had the potential to be so much better. Maybe too much star power threw off the balance of the movie."
2,If you have seen the trailer then you have seen the movie,"If you have seen the trailer then you have seen the movie. Do not waist yourmovie money on this one, wait for cable. I was praying that this cast ofhas-beens could pull this off but they were given little to work with andcan not be to blame for this mess. Eddie Murphy better head back to hisvoice over work on cartoons or slap his agent up side the head for handinghim this script. I remember when Eddie could bring in top dollar in a filmlike this. Pass on this one."
2,I wasn't expecting all the foul language.,"Okay, you may say it is an Eddie Murphy movie. Well, in the last decade he seem to go to family friendly movies and so I started to enjoy him. I honestly don't know if he has done some of his traditional movies in the last 5 years because I don't follow many movies or actors. The only Ben Stiller movies I have seen have been pretty clean too as far as language goes...maybe a word or two. This movie was actually good to me except foul language KILLS a movie for me, especially the gd word. I think foul language is offensive and just sounds ugly. I really thought this was going to be a cleaner movie."
1,I couldnt wait for it to end. Really.,moves extremely slow. not even funny. horrible plot. worse ending. save your self the money and watch a real heist movie if thats what your in the mood for.
1,Big Let Down,"What a disappointing movie. The cast led me to believe i would be seeing an interesting movie about a heist. i love heist movies. However, this one was pretty stupid. The level of humour was elementary school level. Hated the entire movie. Sorry to down this movie so much but it failed."
1,Tower Heist on line rental,"Audio was very poor, I could hardly hear anything. Even with my speakers turned up, I had to strain to hear what they were saying."
3,A rental not a buy,its okay as a rental its a fun movie not one to buy though.its funny in some parts Sidibe's accent wanes a bit but still ok.
2,Definitely pass on this one!,"Story had potential to be good but they left multiple plot twist dangling without resolving any of them, and the ending was very,very,unsatisfying. Overall pass on this movie which is a shame with all the good actors in it."
2,If you rent it for $.99 it comes to about 11 cents/laugh,But I had to include smiles and mild chuckles in my definition of laugh. Eddie is getting a little long in the tooth to play a street punk. An does every FBI/CIA/ATF/EPA heavy in the movies these days have to be a gal?
2,The Heist wasn't about the Tower,One of those movies I'm glad I didn't pay full freight to see at the theater but disappointed I didn't wait until it was free.
3,Mundain Plot with Formulaic Humor,"An adventure-comedy about four former employees of a posh New York City high rise who seek to buglarize the one of its highest profile tenents, a Bernie-Madoff-type financier who lost the entire apartment's staff's retirement while continuing to live high, would almost seem a sure fire hit, especially if it casts Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Alan Alda, and Matthew Broderick. What initially came to mind was a cross between ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" with ""Ocean's Eleven"" but with an extra sparkle from the comedic talents of Stiller and Murphy.But buglarizing an apartment was relatively tame compared to taking down a major Las Vegas casino; and the humor was formulaic: four white, sheltered, criminal neophytes teaming with a quick-talking, black, seedy professional crook--one can pretty much expect the nature of the jokes.As a whole, it wasn't an entirely bad movie. It just wasn't all that good."
1,Even for free this movie is bad,You'll never get the 2 hours back even if you stream this for free on amazon prime. It's sad that they couldn't tell how bad this was going to be while it was being made.
2,Just ... not .... good,"I mean, it takes all kinds, and clearly some people like it. I suspect people who did not like Tower Heist aren't taking time to review it, or just avoided it altogether. But since it took 2 hours of my life (and i was all set to like this movie, btw) I feel the need to point out: It wasn't funny, or effectively dramatic, the trailer told you the whole story. Once finished, you realize the story is just ... too impossible to take remotely seriously. It's a desperate rental at best."
2,Tower Heist,"Eddie Murphy's made a lot of bad films in the past couple of decades, and it's officially old hat to wax nostalgic about the glory days of Beverly Hills Cop and Coming to America. And while it would have been easy to dismiss Tower Heist as a probable bomb due to its outlandish premise, seemingly mismatched cast, and critically unimpressive director, well, it turned out to be another of 2011's pleasant surprises, thanks in large part to Murphy himself. The story centers on a group of luxury apartment employees who lose their pensions in a Ponzi scheme to a businessman and decide to take back what's theirs by ripping him off in an elaborate, well, tower heist. Aided by a star-studded cast that included Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, Tea Leoni, Casey Affleck, and Gabourey Sidibe, Tower Heist represented a return to form for Eddie Murphy. It's a fun little popcorn movie that'll probably do a decent job of keeping you entertained on a Saturday night."
1,absolutely the worst movie ever,"I took my husband on a date night to watch this movie, it was very very very bad. I almost asked for refund. Cant believe its on DVD"
2,Comedic way of reenacting some awful realities.,"This movie is a comedic representation of the stupid way of living of some ultra rich people. It is not an exaggeration of that stupidity, but surely represents the ways of Bernie Madoff and the French guy who raped the hotel attendant. I should have known it is a sort of fable lesson before wasting money making its purchase."
1,Terrible movie- Save your money dont buy it even for 2 bucks,"Terrible movie- Save your money dont buy it even for 2 bucks. I did not find this movie funny at all, very boring movie"
2,Save your money Not worth it,My husband and I rented this thinking it would be funny. Well it wasn't.. With this kind of cast we should have been laughing every five minutes. I don't think either one of us cracked a smile the whole time :( the movie felt very long and played out very slowly.
4,Tower Heist (2 Disc Blu-ray Combo + DVD + Digital Copy,Tower Heist (2 Disc Blu-ray Combo + DVD + Digital Copy WAS SHIPPED FAST. IT WAS A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE. IT WAS AOLD FASHION CRIME CAPER MOVIE IT WAS FUN. BEN STILLER & EDDIE MURPHY WERE GOOD TOGETHER.Tower Heist
3,Ok movie,"We watched this last night and it was an ok movie. Not to much swearing or sex which we are so tired of hearing and seeing in movies. Eddy Murphy was the only one that was offensive and he usually is with his mouth, but he represented the (bad guy) and that is supposedly how they comunicate. It was over all entertaining that is why I gave it the 3 stars."
4,OCEAN ELEVEN MEETS DICK AND JANE,VERY GOOD MOVIE EDDIE AND BEN ARE AT THEIR BEST. ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN IN A WHILE. I RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE
3,Average Movie,"Tower Heist is a average movie worth renting, but not buying. It has its moments that are pretty good, especially when the car is hanging outside the tower, but overall its not as good as it should be considering the cast involved. I think everyone played their parts well, though Eddie Murphy is showing his age trying to play a street punk and more of a role he would have mastered 25 years ago. I was never bored with the movie, but it just wasnt that good. Its a popcorn flick. Rent it when you are bored, don't expect too much from it, and you wont be disappointed."
3,2.5 out of 5 stars,not really funny . it was just barely okay. i would have gave itt 2.5 stars but they dont make a choice of that.
4,Goofy fun,"This was a fun movie, one I'd even watch again down the line. My husband was laughing so hard that it was making me laugh. If you are looking for something light, goofy and good for some laughs, this is a good one to watch. Subtitles would have helped in a couple areas where the tower staff had a thick accent, but we managed to make out what was said without them."
1,RENTAL COPY,"I guess I was under the impression this was a NEW product....in fact, its not!...in fact, its from Video Dollar, 714.529.5876....buyer beware"
4,Just OK,"This movie was OK. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be and it wasn't as interesting as i thought it would be,"
3,Its okay. Not very funny.,"Whatever happened to the great comedies such as Wedding Crashers and Shanghai Knight? Maybe I expect too much out of comedy, but I just didn't think it was very funny. Its not the worst movie I've seen all year, though."
1,One real crime here,"The real crime in this movie was that it was made. Not even the gag reel in the DVD extras is funny. Even for those that are looking for something silly and unpretentious, this movie will be a totally waste of time. They tried to be funny, crime, suspense and action and they ended up with nothing.Only one thing was interesting: Tea Leoni. She was cute."
1,sucks!! sucks!!,"this is just a really bad movie and a total waste of money, should have just waited until it comes on tv. bad, bad really bad."
1,Not so great,"Overall fun concept, but the story line and content was not so great. Language was horrible. Also took a while to get going."
5,Implausible Fun,"Great cast and Eddie is back to being Eddie. Great popcorn movie, really enjoyed sitting back and enjoying. Rent this and you will have fun."
5,the best Movie,The movie ''Tower Heist'' was a good movie I ordered it and Blu-ray for 19.90 and for that amounts I am satisfied and happy with the movie's plot. And I would recommend this movie to a friend.
4,Funny movie lots of Big names,Usually most movies with this many big name actors don't ever really seem to be very good but this one is an exception. All the actors work well with one another to make a really funny movie. Would definitely recommend!
4,"Kind of predictable, but a fun watch","Kind of predictable, but a fun watch. The characters were fun and the premise was cute. For the $0.99 I paid it was worth it."
3,rent Tower Heist,"Good movie, we really enjoyed it. Alan Alda, Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, and Matthew Brodrick are always good. I would recommend this movie."
4,Worth Watching Again,"This was a fun and funny movie. If you wan't to see what should happen to the pigs of the business world, this is the movie."
3,the 99%,"Heist is a funny and fun at times movie with a great comedic cast and typical politically correct directing. Albeit, Question; why are all the Hollywood bad guys white, male, and usually rich, or republican or insinuated to be conservative or religious? We're really getting tired of the Hollywood typical stereotypes and social programming."
3,Not the Towering Inferno of Doggy Doo,"that some reviewers in the press would have us believe.I was expecting the worst, but this film is actually ok! Very similar to Oceans 11 (especially in some sequences and sound-track areas, deliberately of course), this film isn't a laugh a minute ""Airplane"" type spoof, but a fastish paced heist movie, set in tower. It doesnt get too silly and some time is spent fleshing out the characters a little, and all in all, you could do far worse than get this out on a saturday night, or download it or whatever the kids do these days, internet in ireland is generally crap, in fact, in many places, it is actually easier, and cheaper to hire a set of actors to come around to your house and perform the film for you, rather than rely on streaming...for added realism, one of the actors will spin a plate with ""buffering"" on it every few seconds whilst everyone else stands still... ho hum,"
3,Missed opportunity of a movie.,"This movie is just ""okay"". I just wish everything turned up a few notches.Stiller character wasnt ironic enough.Alda character wasnt mean enough.Broderick character wasnt pathetic enough.Murphy character wasnt crooked enough.Afflecks character wasnt desperate enough.Leonis character wasnt beleivable enough.Sidibes character wasnt funny enough.It could have been a high octane performance and a movie . A sadly lost opportunity.Still a pleasant movie if you need to kill an eventless weekend."
3,Decent,Pretty funny movie. No problems streaming. overall i am very satisfied with this purchase. It was a rented streaming movie
4,Better than I thought it would be!,"I thought this movie was much better than the way it was billed and the reviews it got from other viewers. It was comedic and action packed with a rather large, popular cast of actors/characters. Give it chance, you will be pleasantly surprised!"
4,Enjoyable,"I honestly didn't know what to expect, because the trailer really didn't do it justice. All the characters we're played right, they all had their back story for what time allowed was mostly shown. I think some parts were over played, or to detailed and some not enough. Example; the restaurant, with the roach. But overall I recommend it, it has the comedy that Ben, and Eddie are known for. But also keeps the seriousness of the situation. If you haven't enjoyed movies by these two before. You may not like this, for it keeps along of the line of their humor that they've shown in other movies."
4,Solid Movie,"The beginning drew me in and I was carried along. The ending was a little far fetched, but tolerable. Overall, I thought it was a lot of fun and was glad I rented it."
3,Enjoyable Once.,We rented this movie and watched the Blu-ray version last night. The movie is well acted and did a fairly good job of holding our attention all the way through. The story is timely and reminds one of some things that have been going on recently in several places.When it becomes evident one of the wealthy tenants in the tower has engaged in fraud and stolen the pension money from the tower employees pension fund some of the victims decide to take matters into their own hands by stealing back what is rightfully theirs and determine that they need the help of an expert in crime if they are to pull this one off. This is where the Eddie Murphy character comes into the story and proceeds to steal the show as well.Although we did enjoy watching the movie once we will probably not watch it again.
3,alright,It was okay funny at times and other times like get to it already. The end was rushed and didnt explain too well. will not buy on dvd.
3,Preposterously Entertaining,"""Tower Heist"" (2011) offers few surprises for a caper flick, yet remains a pleasant diversion - coasting on the strength of its excellent comic ensemble and Brett Ratner's slick direction. Eddie Murphy and Matthew Broderick have their best film roles in years while Alan Alda makes a terrific Bernie Madoff-inspired scoundrel. Freewheeling escapism most of the way."
4,"Good movie, funny","It's a good comedy movie. Don't expect an epic cinematic experience, but some hilarious scenes mixed with a landscape that is familiar to anyone who has even a basic knowledge of Midtown Manhattan makes for a good watch."
2,I couldn't see it,"I couldn't see it for any length of time. Service was bad. So, I wasn't able to use it at all."
3,"A pretend-heist movie that violates the first rule of a good heist movie - but the cast nearly saves it, anyway","An inconsistent film that ends up being more enjoyable that it deserves to be owing to an enjoyable cast who bring their considerable skill to bear on a movie that doesn't deserve them. The ""heist"" is poorly constructed, seemingly skipping over anything that hasn't been worked out to pick up later without explaining what took place between the segments shared with us. A good heist movie, though, relies on those details. The audience buy-in is purchased with step-by-step detail by a storyteller who doesn't look away or wave his hands about to distract from the gaps. There are a lot of gaps and hand waving in this story. The cast members do their jobs, though, and regain our interest after each gap. Unfortunately, they don't get the opportunity to win us back after the movie limps to it's conclusion.Still, I had fun much of the time."
2,Tower Heist,It was an ok movie to watch it once. Has too many adult refrences. Not as funny as the previews had let on.
2,if you're tired don't watch this...,"I don't understand how you can have a cast like this and still produce a boring movie. I fell asleep about half way through.Good thing it was just a rental. I didn't even have the urge to try and finish it later. That's how ""good"" it is."
2,terrible movie,I was hoping that the movie plot would come together nicely but it was a snoozer for me at least. Good luck to all who view this movie.
1,Won't Stream on Playbook,I viewed the trailer for this movie on my Blackberry Playbook with no issues. I rented the movie and now it will not play. What's the deal?
4,Money is paper with ink,"Gold is better than money, funny let many new ideals. The movie business is not easy. Bring a follow up.Gold will always shine if you look closely"
4,Well written,"This is a well-written book by a Canadian teenager, which was described to me as a children's book. It is a fascinating look at some of the details of hatching and raising birds, but it could use some illustrations. It is well edited, which is unusual because print-on-demand book publishers (this one is by the premier POD publisher, iUniverse, Inc.) do not usually offer proofreading services.All in all, this is a good little book. The author hopes to write an adult novel soon. I wish him well. This one would easily rate 5 stars, were it not for the lack of illustration, from which it would greatly benefit--especially if done by a competent children's book artist.Joseph (Joe) Pierre"
2,you can do better than this,"These bra tanks manage to be both extremely stiff/tight fitting and NOT to provide support. They are also very long - actually enough to be considered a tunic. You'd be better off with a good nursing bra and cotton nursing tank. Also, on-line shoppers beware: Glamourmom has a very restrictive return policy. Tanks can only be returned within 14 days and TOTALLY free of any deodorant, lotion or other stuff that normally gets on clothes when you try them on. They suggest trying them on right after you shower -- as a mother of two, I can tell you it's tough to fit in a shower, let alone trying on clothes afterwards. You can do better than these tanks."
2,Odd fit,"I purchased 2 of these after my first baby because I was desperate for something to support my belly. I'm pretty slim with a small waist but had to order these in large because my milk supply was enormous and my breasts swelled to almost an E cup. The waist/belly ended up being almost too tight and also rode up often. The straps seemed too far over, cutting into my armpits and leaving a big gap in the middle of the bust when I moved my arms together. The nursing holes on the inner material were oddly placed and ended up pulling on my nipples, which was not only uncomfortable but caused me to leak even more milk than I normally did. The only things I did like about these were the cheerful colors and the length (when they actually stayed down)."
3,"Great if you're tall, awful for ease of use","I have a L glamourmom nursing tank in white. I never review products but felt compelled to do so on this one. If you do not need the length, PLEASE save yourself the money and buy a nursing tank from the red bullseye store. They are much more comfortable and 100% more easier to close the snap one handed. Glamourmom is only good for the added length...it is wonderfully long, great for a 5'11 gal like myself! For this reason, I keep the tank. Otherwise, it would be gone. It is far too hard to close one handed, almost impossible actually. The entire breast area is oddly constructed...whereas the 'bullseye store' tank is simple. Maybe Glamourmom will catch on and redesign. A note on the white...it can not be worn alone as it is a tad bit see through."
1,Boo on Glamourmom,"Don't do it!I bought three Glammom tanks in various styles, ordered a size up, and even so every one of the tanks was too small. WAY too small. Like, Euro-trash going clubbing tight. Probably not the post-partum look you're going for. If you ARE going for that look, order carefully, because GM's return policy is basically ""Eff You! We have your money and there's nothing you can do about it!""Honestly, I wouldn't buy from GlamourMom again, and I would advise my friends against it, too. I found better-fitting, more comfortable and more convenient-to-use (not to mention WAY less expensive) nursing tanks at a nearby big-box store. Glamourous, indeed!What a waste of money. I will be passing on 4 unused, unreturnable tanks (size L) to a size 2 friend."
2,small boobs make this nursing top annoying,"I have this top and it just doesn't work for me. the interior behind the front panel has a ""hole"" for where your breasts come out. I guess my breasts are too small (probably a b+ cup, tank is a size small)because the fabric always interferes with nursing. it get too close to my nipples and i always have to push it away when nursing. it got pretty annoying. i wouldn't mind so much but this is an expensive nursing top. Instead i got one from target and it's great, the under panel is completly open which allow for skin to skin which i like.a plus with this top is that it is thick and not see through, which i found that most white nursing tops are."
3,Depends on Nursing Cup size,"I bought the tank in size medium based on the reviews that this top runs big and is very long. It's true the top is long so you don't have to worry about the bottom riding up. I wish I would have bought a size or two larger. The tank fit great in the stomach and hip area, but the top of the tank doesn't provide enough support or coverage for larger cup sizes. I found that the straps dug into my shoulders even with adjustment and the top portion did not comfortably cover my cleavage. When worn under another shirt it created a line (like a panty line but for cleavage:(() on my front. Not very flattering. Also the inner lining was small so that it squeezed my breast so that I would leak milk although it does stretch with use... I really like the concept of the tank vs a nursing bra so I can pull up my shirt, nurse under a cover and not show my postpartum belly:( Again I'm large breasted, over DD. So that is why I can not recommend this tank for women of larger cup sizes."
1,Not worth the money,"I was excited to try this bra, but the fit was really bad. The cup size was too big (I got the medium & I am a 34 B pre-breast feeding, probably a C now) but fit snugly around my postpartum belly (it's been a month since I've given birth). I had better luck with the nursing tanks from target, they are half the cost & at least you can try them on first."
3,Nursing Tops,"The top definitely fit and will serve it's purpose, but I did have a couple of concerns. The top layer sits slightly lower than the lower layers. You can also see the circular wholes through the top layer and through the shirt you wear over the top as well. The only way to not see the circles is to wear a thicker material shirt over the top, which means this won't be an option for post nursing."
4,Great long tank,"I have a size medium Glamourmom tank in black that I used when my daughter was an infant, 4 years ago. I wore this tank almost exclusively when breastfeeding for 11 months, mostly layered under shirts/jackets. I am 5'-10"" and a 36B and loved the length and overall coverage of this tank. The nursing holes were a bit annoying, but I usually used cloth nursing pads with the tank, so it was not a big deal. While I also had another tank that I liked a lot, this one was my favorite due to the length and coverage. With many months of washing and drying, the black only faded slightly and I am looking forward to using the one I have and buying another one for nursing my second baby, due in June."
4,Long and Lean - Order Size Up,"Love, love, love that this nursing tank is SO long. I ordered my typical size and it was slightly tight, though, and got tighter after washing. I recommend you order a size up."
3,cute but uncomfortable,very nice looking but the inside mesh lining is so itchy and uncomfortable! i live in a very humid climate and it was just unbearable. I would recommend going with the Bravado nursing tank instead.
1,Rude & Unhelpful Customer Service,This company is a joke. If you want to spend $44 on a nursing cami then go to Pea in the Pod. The customer service department very rude!
3,Tight,Large size was too tight around my stomach and too roomy in the chest. I wear size 6 pants and a medium for tops. They just don't seem to be good for my body type.
2,Not Worth the Money Paid,"I bought two of these tanks because I needed something to wear around the house that was comfortable, but would allow for easy nursing. I have not been very happy with my buy:1. It is IMPOSSIBLE to clasp this one handed, which is a must on any nursing bra/tank. When I wear this, I have to rest my baby on the couch or in my lap to get this clasped.2. After one wash and air dry cycle, it shrunk horribly; about 2 sizes. I always wash in cold water3. The straps are very flimsy so a buxom lady will find that they are uncomfortable and can get twisted and dig into the shoulders.The only reason I gave this tank 2 stars instead of one is the variety of colors and patterns they offer. I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a comfortable nursing tank as it is anything but."
3,Wouldn't buy again!,"I first purchased this tank in a medium but it was WAY too tight - I am 5'10"", 140 pounds and normally wear a 34B or 34C bra. I returned it and purchased a large which is better, but when I unfasten the hooks to nurse the openings for the breast is way off to the side. It is almost like it is built for someone who has breasts that are extremely separated - very odd.I like extra length but would not buy again. The Target ones are easier to use and much cheaper. I was tempted to just give two stars in this review but since I still occassionally wear it (when my Target ones are dirty) it must not be THAT bad."
1,rashes from elastic shelf bra,"I bought two of these in white and black. I loved the way they looked, but eventually the tanks gave me rashes where the elastic shelf bra rubbed against my ribcage under the bust. I don't know what they use in the elastic, but I've since switched to another brand of nursing tank and the rashes went away."
1,The Worse,"I am a woman with many pairs of slingback shoes and I have to say these are the worse I have ever bought. I was greatly disappointed. They are not soft, have no flexibility and the heel is weak."
4,Very high output backpacker's stove,"The igniter sparks, but I've not been able to make it work even once. I have no problem carrying a lighter though.The burner puts out as much heat as a large burner on my home's stove. A decent wind does not blow it out when above half-way. With no wind, it can be turned down to simmer.Using full power is wasteful of gas, but having the extra power settings allows one to get more power out of the stove as the cartridge gets low. That is why I purchased this stove.The pot holders are fairly solid, but I would be nervous about having a heavy pot on them."
3,Nice small stove,"A great stove for the money and puts out lots of BTUs, but the ignitor started acting finnicky after only 6 days of use, then quit. Not necessary to have, but if they are going to include it they should make it more durable. Have matches or a lighter as a back-up."
1,What happened?,"I used Exam Cram Practice Questions, the Sybex book and the Sybex E-trainner. I got from 85 to 95% on the Exam Cram tests, the Sybex book was OK, and the E-trainner was great. However the Exam Cram tests were nothing like the real CCNA test (I failed). The Exam Cram questions were too easy, didn't cover all the material, and if anything gave me the false impression the test would be straight forward. Did they make a mistake at the printer and sold a 640-407 book instead of a 640-507 book?? I think this book will look good in my fireplace, ON FIRE!!"
1,Not very helpful,"This book was not very helpful at all. It probably covered about 10% of the materials on the exam. I did pass the exam with a 924/1000, but I thank my four years of experience with Cisco routers and networking for that and not the book. I wouldn't waste my money on this book."
4,Great album!,I saw Chris & Thomas in San Francisco a month ago; prompted the buy of this CD. Great folksy music -- only wish there were more songs!
4,Fast approach to worldwide electricity market understanding!,"I used this book for an MBA project work about Italian electricity market. Easy to read and understand, it covers the basics of deregulation, the electricity market pool, the basic activities such as generation, trasmission, distribution and retail and proposes some real cases about market liberalization (California, Norway, Spain and Argentina) that should help to understand every kind of specific worldwide market. I found this book very useful for my educational purposes but maybe it could be too much generic for professional people."
2,Ok if your'e not looking for excellent,"I ordered my usual size, but they were too small. They even looked rather medeocre. I was going to an event with international presence so anything less than awesome simply wouldnt do. If you ordered a size larger and were merely going to a church or civic function, these would satisfy your requirement and prevent you from being cast to the side of the curb by thugs. But for buisness or formal parties, don't waste your time or money."
3,"Good for Windows, bad for Macs","We have several of these in our office. They work well for Windows PCs, but Macs and iPod Touch/iPhones have trouble connecting to them reliably, even with the latest firmware. I'd go with some other brand if you have to support Apple equipment. 3Com does have a handy Windows program for discovering and configuring these things, and their web config interface is pretty good as those things go."
1,I can't believe they charge 300 dollars for this,Do not buy this product. It is an absolute piece of garbage. I have spent hours trying to configure this thing to work with XP Pro machines with wireless cards and could absolutely not get this to work with even the most basic of configurations. I teach networking and PC repair so I know what I am doing. Avoid this product.
5,Good Solid Box,"A very smart looking box that assembled quite easily. It's real wood, like the other Winsome products I've gotten, which means it takes some finesse to get it to go together properly--don't crank down each screw as you put it in, leave them loose so you can jostle the parts and crank the screws in sequence 1/4 turn. The lid is square but the box itself can get rhombus-y, so use the lid to help you decide which parts to jostle. I still had a little bit of disjointedness on one edge, but I put that side towards the wall so who cares.It has a strong (if your head is near it) smell of the polyurethane sealant. It'll go away.Edit: I added a pair of small hinges on the back and a spring-loaded support (designed for holding lids open) inside in the middle. Got it all from Home Depot, probably cost $12 altogether and it made the box infinitely more useful since you don't have to find a place to set the lid down every time you want to sift through the box."
1,Poor quality,"I can't image how this piece of you know what passed quality control. Wood has cracks and scratches, in some spots the stain is very dark in others very light. It went back the next day."
3,What furniture for $50 do you expect to be great?,"Not much, is the answer to that question. Very little is made from solid hardwoods now-a-days and everything just takes a single hex wrench (included) to put together. That said, this is an ok product. Exterior has a decent finish. I'd recommend putting it together ""loose"" without tightening all the (8) screws so you can get its fit as best as you can. I had one corner which would not sit flush; the cube was going in a corner of a room so I just hid that in the corner instead of trying to make it perfect.Don't expect perfection or excellent value; this has an average of 3 stars for a reason but if you have realistic expectations you should be content."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered two of these storage cubes and was very disappointed. Although the wood appeared to be lovely, a deep glossy brown, when I tried to assemble the cubes I found that one went together very unevenly, leaving a small gap between the lid and the box, and the other wouldn't go together at all. The holes were drilled too far off to permit screwing the parts together.I boxed them both back and returned them for a refund."
3,"A nice looking end-table, not so efficient storage.","I had a middle-of-the-road kind of experience assembling this - one of the assembly holes was too large so I used some wood glue on that seam to give added support, and so far that's working. The shape is distinctive and I wouldn't have expected solid wood for the price (even full list price). Quality and thickness of veneer seems appropriate for the price. At the discounted price it's an OK value. For the full list price I'd be disappointed, particularly with the assembly. My biggest complaint/observation based on my usage pattern is that a top-open for a storage box is a bad idea unless it has a cushion or something (i.e. like a window seat) to keep me from piling stuff on top. Right now it's a nice end table and will never be really useful (for me) as a storage solution. Something like a pivot open (where stuff on top wouldn't have to move) would be a decent solution also."
2,"Low quality, functional","This was low quality. The wood was split/damaged in places. It wasn't worth it to return, after I'd put it together, but, given the damage, this also isn't worth $50. It's functional now, but I'll get rid of it when I'm ready to upgrade because it looks like a piece of junk."
3,"Nice quality, useful","This was a gift and is much appreciated. It can be used as an end table and with storage, so it's very useful. Quality is decent."
5,Worth it!,These storage cubes are great value for the price. I ordered four to use as tables for the living room. They are very sturdy. I have had them for awhile now and they are holding up nicely. I receive lots of compliments on them. The amount of storage inside each one is pretty amazing.
3,"do it yourself, carefully","For overpriced Chinese dreck (which is what it is) this item is really not bad. The seven pieces have a nice look, closely simulating wood, and are deceptively heavy, something of a plus for those of us who remember when wooden furniture actually was made of wood.It comes with eight bolts and a wrench, and looks as though it would take five minutes to fit the pieces together. Fitting them together is a bit awkward. Make certain you arrange the first two pieces exactly as shown in the diagram. Otherwise, you may spend hours putting the thing togeter."
3,"Overall Decent, but not a perfect fit","This item looks good in my living room but the edges don't line up exactly when assembled. Because of this, the lid can only be put on in one direction, despite being a square top. Likewise, the bottom has a small space on one edge where it doesn't line up perfectly. All the same, it looks great in the middle of my living room, and the small imperfections lead me to keep it. If given the choice though, I might explore something else if purchasing again."
1,Complete Frustration,"Unless you own a power drill, and a lot of patience, I would avoid this product. The holes for the attachment points do not lineup properly, are too small and the attaching hardware is too short to avoid at least an hour of frustration. You can fix it andhave a heavy, and probably nice looking piece if you can get some better hardware and have the tools. Not me."
2,Didn't Work for Me,"I kept reading Smith's ""To Be of Use"" hoping for some nugget of truth or new spin on an idea, but somehow the book didn't just come together for me. I find his writing style to be more of a grocery list of his personal accomplishments and readings, rather than a thoughtful analysis and synthesis of experience. We need more business leaders that share Smith's value-system, but this book just wasn't compelling for this reader."
5,Inspiring and engaging,"Dave Smith is a man of vision who walks his talk. He's brought values and conscience to his business ventures, and has rubbed elbows with many others who've done the same. He's unassuming and down-to-earth as he shares not only his experiences but the meaning behind them, and the impact a host of fellow Creative Action Heroes have had on their small communities and the world at large. ""To Be of Use"" entertains with Dave's characteristic easy, familiar voice, and it inspires those of us who hope to put our visions into action, and be truly useful in our work and in all the choices we make each day."
5,In Search of Sequels,"I really enjoyed this book, and to tell the truth I'm surprised I did. Usually I select a book that has a girl as the main character, or at least a little romance to make it more interesting. Since this book had neither, I only read it because it was supposed to be good and we already owned it. I hardly cared about the French Revolution. But once I had started ""In Search of Honor"", I could hardly put it down!This book is the story of Jacques Chenier, a fictional character whose life is torn apart one day when his father is murdered. His desire for revenge gets him in deep trouble, and what follows is a gripping story of hate and its consequences, as Jacques learns the true meaning of honor. Even if you aren't interested in the French Revolution, I would recommend this book."
4,Inspiring tale of the French Revolution,"My eighth grade students and I read this book together in school. We all enjoyed the story because it coincided with our study of the French Revolution.The tale follows the trials and tribulations of young Jacques as he grows up during this uncertain time. There are many historical references and it made my students feel like they really knew what life was like during that time.The story also contains an inspirational message and meaningful ""moral"". An excellent historical fiction novel!!"
2,"It is worth it's price, nothing!","I bought it thinking that it would do no harm trying it, seen the price. The next thing I did after listening to it was to trash it, I even didn't dare to give it to Oxfam for charity. It is a very bad american style mess of different low quality pieces of music/songs, I would not call it jazz. for the love of jazz it should have not be published! my opinion, sorry. you will be disappointed for the shipping charge."
5,Everyone Has Time for UNO,My family has been playing UNO for years. The thing about UNO is that you can play for a short time if your time is limited or play for long periods of time. The game is quick and stays lively so nobody becomes bored. My grandson and I have played for short periods of time but we have also played for hours and a couple of times we just kept the game out and played at times over a couple of days; this is marathon UNO at its best!!!
5,"a moody, cohesive listen","You know an album is special when it has Sigur Ros, Califone and The Black Heart Procession on it.Then:1. Add Arab Strap and the explosive instrumental tracks ofKinski.2. Make all the songs new or rare.C. Sequence it in a way that flows like a record by one artist...and you've got a masterpiece."
2,defective parts,"This is a perfectly acceptable valet stand but of course it has to be assembled. That would be fine if the parts were not defective.I bought this for my son who is an engineer. The first one had to be returned because several pieces were defective.The second package had some minor problems which he was able to correct with a drill. Once put together it seems tobe OK. It is a hassle to have it almost all together, then have to take it apart, pack it up, and return it to the UPS store."
4,Suit Valet,We use these in the office for the attorneys to hang their suits until next appearance. Very sturdy. Keeps it organized and wrinkle free.
3,Not bad,It is an OK product.The metal bars are falling off. The mirror is not usable. However it still do a good job as a valet stand.
4,My son uses this for his uniform as it doesn't take up too much space in his bedro,My son uses this valet to hang up his uniform. It doesn't use up too much space in his bedroom.
2,"does the word ""gift"" mean nothing to you?","I ordered the valet stand as a gift---clearly stated and clearly marked on the order receipt. So why is it shipped in a box that is quite clearly marked ALL OVER with a picture and description of the contents?? Which my husband immediately, I am sure, noticed when he arrived home from work before me and took the mail/deliveries into the house?This was disappointing. Make a check under the category: CHRISTMAS SURPRISE SPOILED.That being said, I have not had the opportunity to put the valet stand together, so it may be perfect in every other way---just don't know yet. But it would be good to let the buyer know if it can't be shipped in an unmarked box, in case they needed to make other arrangements. Thanks."
3,bike tires,"I put them on my burley trailer, I got about 2,000 miles out of them before they wore to belting. The only can take 35 psi so they wattle under load. But they are cheap as hell."
4,Great Priced Tire,"We use these tires for our jogger and they seem to hold up very well. Not the best for areas with thorns, etc. but work very well on paved roads."
1,"So How Much Were You Payed, For That Review ?.","You cant be real with these 5 star reviews, I hope you got payed for you time watching and reviewing this movie, cause I feel cheated out of 93 minutes of my life, if you give this movie 1 star your being generous, I might have to burn this DVD so a dumpster diver doesn't ruin his enjoyment of his dirty tuna fish sandwich by watching this movie !.Next time, ""Keep It Realistical !"".Flourish"
4,I LOVED this movie!,"I loved it! Really, really cute. Erika Amato is terrific as the wild and wacky Jula and my second favorite was Allison Munn's 'Tequila'. She was hysterical.I only had 2 small problems with it. First, I just had a hard time believing that Scott and Skipper were really brothers. They were just as different as night and day. Second - There wasn't enough music in it. I thought with the subject matter (and the cast) there would be a lot more. Erika's singing at the beginning certainly made me wish for more. But all in all I really loved it and I'm delighted that I bought the DVD. I'll be watching this one more than once!A Couple of Days and Nights"
3,Good for what they are,"These earrings are fine for what they are - just small hoops that won't get in the way of your daily life or sleeping habits. It took me 10 minutes of fussing trying to get them to latch in my ears before I called my husband up and he connected them in about 30 seconds, so I would recommend having someone else do it first without bothering to try struggling yourself. There was a snag on one of them, right where the latch connects, and that gets caught on things, but other than that these are well made and truly silver - I'm allergic to nickel so I would know if they weren't:) They are very comfortable to sleep in and don't bother me at any time during the day. Also if you want earrings that will just fit over your earlobes, then these are going to be bigger than you want, there is about a quarter inch under my ear. Measure 9/16ths in. before you buy so you know how big they are. Overall, an adequate purchase, they could be better, could be worse."
4,Missed Opportunity,"As a music buyer for a bookstore, I listened to Q Stone expecting a typical hair band, def leppard wannabe. What I got was a classic southern rock CD that tips its hat to every great souther rock band in America. A little Dire Straits, a little Lynnard Skynnard, and a lot of classic rock.Way over looked and a missed opportunity for a place in the great southern rock lexicon of music."
4,"as advertised, good solid sunglasses","Good sunglasses at this price point, not as good as Oakley in fit but every bit as good in visual quality and styling. I'm very happy with how the world looks through these sunglasses."
4,"Rudolf Caracciola, Mercedes Grand Prix ace","Quite interesting as historical document. Caracciola was a better driver than writer. His account is often vague and he clearly avoids the controversial issues, like the links between Grand Prix racing and National Socialism. The overall tone of the book is a bit aloof, but that was Rudi allright!Very interesting pictures."
3,Celta book,Not as good as her other series in my opinion because the characters felt immature to mebut I did read them all.
2,The cat was great!,Well the cat Zanth was the one bright spot in this book. I laughed at what he said and did. The main characters of this book Rand T'Ash and Danith Mallow were boring to me. They seemed very self involved and really didn't seem to be loving of the other. I wish this book had been better. I liked some of the other secondary characters of the Holly brothers because they seemed more alive and spirited. There were some interesting sub plots but the author didn't really explore them which I think would have made the story better.
3,Not what I thought it would be...,"I recently stumbled across this author's Llandrana series and absolutely love it. So finding out she also had this series as well, I thought I'd pick them up and enjoy them just as much. Unfortunately the opposite is true.I'm not quite sure if it's the fact that the character of T'Ash got on my nerves with his beyond absolute need for domination in all things around him, or the complete confusion I had when trying to follow a character who is speaking normally then reverts to ""Downwind""! Honestly, the best part of the novel was the pure enjoyment I got from the character of Zanth the FAMcat.I've read both this novel and Heart Thief from cover to cover. I'm sad to say that this won't be a series I'll continue with from this author. I'll just bide my time until her next Llandrana novel comes out...which will hopefully be very very soon!"
3,Was really hard to finish,"I can usually devour a book in 1 sitting, but this one took me a few days. I really thought I would have enjoyed the book more, but the story was so slow to progress. I really like the plot and theme of the book, but the author just droned on and on, I was ready for the book to end. Not enough attention was placed on the 2 main characters, there were too many other superfluous things going on around them. I know there are more in the series, but I just can't bring myself to read them after how much effort it took me to finish this one."
5,"Celta, a good read","Are you a fan of Dara Joy or Jayne Castle? Then you'll absolutely love Robin D. Owens' HeartMate. Just imagine a planet settled by descendants of a Celtic society, people with powers that were feared and misunderstood on earth. Generations later, a woman raised in an orphanage hopes the greatest power of all, love, can win her wild Lord while he, of noble lineage but a rough past, fights to win the hand of his HeartMate. Although this is a fantasy, Ms. Owens has created believable characters who will leave you wanting more. For comic relief, Ms. Owens knows you can never go wrong with a cat...and what a cat!"
1,Something similar about this story..,I picked up this book expecting a new original work. But instead I found a work which is reminiscent of several other authors. This work incorporates elements from Dara Joy's Matrix of Destiny series and Jayne Castle's Flower series mixed with a touch of wiccan practices.If you are looking for good futuristic paranormal I would recommend that you go for the original....Dara or Jayne.They have done this story first and better.
5,One guy's opinion,I don't know about academics and consultants. I'm just a ordinary sales guy. This book truly helped me more than anything I have done so far. I can't figure how anyone who understands the pressure of prospecting could rant against this book. Reading some of the rants made me want to put in my two cents so other sales types won't be put off from buying a real jewel of a book.
3,Save your money....,The information in the book is too much. It is like drinking from a fire hose. I felt cheated after I bought the book. It does not help you get on phone.
1,The Psychology of sales call reluctance,This is the absolute most worthless book on sales call reluctance I have ever read.
5,Can't believe anyone would not like this book,"This book is real science for anyone associated with the sales profession. As a scientist myself, I appreciate the flawless logic and meticuloulsly worked insights. The citations are all properly referenced (unusual for any book of this genre!) and the applications are a welcome addition to the science of sales management. True, those who whince and wine about selling will likely be put off by this book. At times it lacks diplomacy, but never humor and civility, and wanna-be book reviewers will probably be put off by its no nonsense approach. But if I want a book on diplomacy, I will buy one. I'm an executive sales manager, and this book starts delivering what I want in the FIRST chapter. That's content I can use and results I can count. I can't speak for others, but for me, that is all that matters. E.Festinger, Ph.D."
2,Full of information (that exists everywhere on the internet),"This book includes a great amount of information about joining the military (obviously), but lacks some of the more in-depth questions I had about joining.Most of the information I found was essentially a semi-organized collection of all the information I'd researched on the internet. There was nothing new I learned from reading this book, and the author is making a buck off of you for not spending the time to research the internet or ask questions on internet forums that don't cost you a dime.The bottom line is that if you want to join the military: get the fundamental information from the internet and web-forums, ask veterans your additional questions, and then meet a recruiter. There's absolutely no reason you should buy this book."
2,NOT Benny Goodman,"It is nice, from public TV program. Sing Sing Sing is a knock out. But this is not Benny Goodman, someone called Abe Most replaces him."
5,Highly Recommend,This is an excellent CD Wallet! It's exactly what I wanted and I am very happy with my purchase.
2,taking advantage,"You know i remember talking to mr Brown who did the one review here. I bought this cd thinking how great to dig up this unreleased material. Having come from Pittsburgh, a city he loved to play and the home of Billy Price the singer on the livestock album I had seen Roy many times. There is nothing you could do to describe one of his shows.From what I understand,Mr Brown gathered these songs or the rights for them from the widow of Roy. I wonder who exactly profited from this release. I believe this is substandard and a waste of you time and money. I certainly believe that the almighty dollar was the number one reason for this. So if you read the review by mister Brown, please remember that he has a stake in the sales. Search elsewhere. I rated it a 2 because its Roy. Thats the only reason."
3,Definitely not the best collection...,"I bought this CD after hearing a version of Malaguena on Sirius Radio that almost made my head explode. :)I thought that the song came from this album, but the song here is a different version. Anyway... for me this is not the best of Roy Buchanan. The earlier songs sound really dated, and while it is interesting to hear him in intimate settings, the loud voices talking in some of the songs while Roy is noodling away are very distracting and annoying. Just my humble opinion, of course. And as has already been mentioned, the sound quality is very poor on some tracks.That being said, there ARE some really good songs here that any fan of Roy Buchanan will enjoy. But if you looking for a better overview of Roy's material I would recommend ""Sweet Dreams: The Anthology"", even if that collection has some weak entries too."
1,US buyers beware! 220 volt international version!!!,"Amazon needs to make that clear in the description. It never crossed my mind that Amazon would be selling a 220 volt version of a UPS unit. The company (APC) came through, I was very impressed. I called them and explained what happened. Since it was under warranty they sent me the correct unit at no cost and even sent a pre-paid shipping label to return the international unit to them. Kudos to APC!!! I love the new unit, works great."
3,satisfyed but..,a good speaker for voice but weak with music. bass response is inadequate. very compact and easy to use.
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"I've had this speaker for a couple of weeks now and it is everything they say it is. When I travel with my laptop I use it to watch DVDs and listen to my music collection and it sounds great - way better than any other portable speakers I've tried. The sound is good but what's also great about this Yamaha speaker is the three-way power options. Plug it into the wall, use batteries, or runs off your USB power while hooked to your PC playing your tunes. I haven't used the battery option much so I can't comment on the battery life but, I suspect it is not great since the speaker puts out 20-watts. I don't think you can find a better sounding speaker with these power options for less. (If you can - let me know...please!)"
4,Jury is still out,"Bought for my son who asked for a beach radio which would interface with his Ipod. He doesn't need a radio so this I thought would be ideal. We tested indoor and found nice sound. We found some flucuations in sound at high vol. Nice and compact 1 cable, w/pouch he can carry at least 2 sets of batts. and one cable. Better than a boom box. I am Tivoli-Pal fan but this was $100 cheaper w/comparable sound but no AM/FM, however Tivoli does not have a backup power option on the beach. More to come..."
5,Swing Like A Pro,Like new book that was delivered in a timely manner.Excellent price.Have had only good experience dealing with Amazon.Highly recommend purchasing books from this site.Paul & Florence Mannino
2,Beware average golfer,"If you don't shoot right around par, and especially if you slice the ball, this book will only make you worse. The transition from backswing to downswing as it is taught here is not only extremely difficult to execute, it will most certainly lead to swinging over-the-top (outside-in), causing you to, at best, pull shots left of the target (for right-handers) and at worst, slice the ball all over the place. If, however, you already hit a right to left hook, the book can help you. Unfortunately, the average golfer wouldn't know a hook if it bit him on the nose."
1,Bad News For Hackers,"I must say that I am far from being a good golfer, but this book did very little to aid in my progress. The purpose of this book seems to be providing a technical look at the golf swing. However, I do not think this is the best approach for beginners and I'm not sure how much an advanced player would gain either. Advice like slide-turn-slide-turn, and moving your lower body and upper body in different directions during the transition might be technically correct, but are not very good swing thoughts. I think a technical approach like this one breeds too much tension in most players. Most recreational players would benefit from a book like Jim Flick's ""On Golf"", much more."
