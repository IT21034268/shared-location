2,Irwin Naturals 3-in-1 Joint Formula (90 Softgels),The pills are easy to swallow and don't have a particular bad/great taste but they didn't really work for me.
2,3 in 1 joint softgels,This product was not effective and the color was different from my prior purchase at my local healthfood store.. I purchased this product twice from my local healthfood store and I had great results.
3,Horse Pills!,"It smells a little like chocolate when I opened the bottle but it definitely doesn't taste like it. In fact, it's a little salty tasting. My biggest complaint is the size. It's HUGE! I had problems swallowing just one and the directions say to take 6 per day!!"
3,Knee pain relief,First I ordered 2 bottles of this pills and noticed relief in my knee joint pain. The doctor had told me that I have arthritis in both my knees and was more severe in the right knee. I was barely able to bend my knee 1/2 way but after taking these pills for several weeks I was able to bend my knee almost 3/4 of way knee. I ordered 2 more bottles and am taking these pills twice a week.
3,very natural supplement,"For me it seems like you need to be careful of the rest of your diet, or they won't work. Very common issue with supplements most people are not aware of. Fast food and soda drinks (high sodium) won't give you the ultimate efficacy of this product. I know cause I've tried it that way. On the bright side they're supper natural and at an amazing price (whole foods 30+)."
1,terrible,I orders two of the squared sprinklers. One leaked at the corner joint and both leaked at the hose connection. As others said the water pattern is not close to what was advertised. Great concept but poor product quality. Returned both.
2,Sprinkler squared underperforms,the sprinkler squared doesn't perform as advertised. Only sprays half the area stated. Stick with the larger unit based on impulse head which perform MUCH BETTER.
3,Spray pattern not as large as indicated,"bought the square sprinkler head to cover a thin stretch of grass and bed along the side of the house....needed the 4X30 spray pattern..but actually acheived a 2X30 pattern...its adequate for the area, but the larger pattern would have done a better job of complete coverage...easy to install per the instructions....the other two spray patterns available on the head adjustment worked fine..."
1,Not Lanolin,This product advertizes itself as 100 percent Lanolin. It is not. It has mineral oil and petrolatum in it. If you are looking for pure Lanolin don not buy this product.
3,formula has been changed,"I have been using DAX since I was 16 years old(I am now 52)I loved it then. It was the only hair product that would make my long, thick hair hold its curl and make it soft. I have noticed that the formula and consistency has changed. I'm not happy. Why mess with a good thing?Reta from Buffalo"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING- MORE OTHER INGRED THAN LANOLIN,"I was deceived by this ad and bought this junk.This is outright false advertising. I feel cheated. The major ingredient is vaseline type petroleum jelly and what lanolin there is, is ALSO CUT WITH WATER AND MINERAL OIL! SO IT IS NOT 100% PURE LANOLIN like I intended to purchase!!"
2,Misleading label,"The description of the product is ""Dax 100% Pure Lanolin Super Conditioner 14 oz. The product however, contains well less than 50% lanolin. The product is not bad, for what it is made of, but it is grossly misadvertised and the label itself is very misleading (you have to read the fine print about the ""100% Pure LANOLIN,"" where it says, ""compounded with."" I was looking for real pure lanolin."
1,Deceptive Advertising!,This item is deceptively advertised or perhaps mis-advertised! This is NOT 100% pure lanolin. This is a petroelum product with a bit of lanolin added.I do not understand why this product is allowed to be advertised as such.I am very disappointed in Amazon allowing this to remain listed.
1,false advertisement,This product is NOT 100% lanolin! The first ingredient listed is Petrolatum-a bi-product of petroleum! Also includes Paraffin. I recommend anyone who chooses healthful products to buy something else.
1,Not as described,"This is sold as 100% pure lanolin. But it is not, it includes a little 100% pure lanolin in a petroleum product. NOT THE SAME!"
1,this product sucks!,I did not read the reviews before I ordered this product. The label says 100% lanolin conditioner. Petroleum is the 1st ingredient. Really? what is it supposed to condition? very SORRY I order this. I feel like I got ripped off.
1,not as advertised,"Should have read the reviews first (live and learn). Looking at the JAR LABEL, it says ""100% PURE LANOLIN. To me, it means pure lanolin. Added to the insult is the perfume - ugh!"
1,Not 100% Pure,This is not 100% pure lanolin. It contains lanolin and that is all. Very deceptive and deceiving labeling. The labeling should be changed.
1,Completely deceptive packaging,"I wish I read the description and reviews more carefully!. The label say ""100% pure lanolin"" in big type and ""compounded with"" in little blurry grey type. It's mostly petroleum jelly with some water. Very disappointed and returning it. I can't believe I just spent $8.80 on petroleum jelly!"
5,needs to be read,"With all the hype and confusion brought to us daily through the media, this book is a rational way to look at the facts as they are, instead of how different groups want them to be seen.A fast read, short chapters but plenty of places to start if you want to delve deeper. Clearly written by someone with an appreciation for what looking at all sides of an issue can bring in terms of clarity and reason. Something the right will hate to see on the best seller list.If you think that you might like this book, you will! Get it, and start getting it."
5,A must read!,The writting clips along at an energegetic pace that kept my nose in the book until it was finished. Mr. Hill does an excellent job at giving an unbiased look at the problems that face society and academia with the prevailing attitudes of political correctness. I am buying this copy for a gift.
2,good and original - but not simultaneously,"I admit that I could not stick with this book. Nothing in it seemed new, insightful or particularly clever. THe characters were stale caricatures and have been seen before in fiction and in reality. If you have just come out of a 20 year stint in the Amazonian forest with your now-college-age child and have not yet investigated universities in the US, this book may have something for you. In all other cases, pick up something else."
4,Poetry,"This book was much more than I expected it to be. It was a coming of age story, a love story, a gentle stroll through the verdant fields of spiritual philosophy, and a critical look at the values of a capitalist society. And above all, it was poetry!"
1,Casters don't work,"Same problem as another reviewer, the rear casters don't work properly. I didn't feel safe raising and lowering the car with the casters jamming so I ended up getting a Torin low profile jack from Walmart for the same $$. Would stay away from this product."
4,Works well enough,"The jack itself seems pretty sturdy and is definitely a huge upgrade over the flimsy scissor jacks that come with most cars. My only real complaint is that the casters (the smaller wheels that pivot) don't roll very well, which doesn't get in the way of operation but does make it harder to move around. The paint chips pretty easily -- a few pieces have flaked off where the handle and jack connect -- but I don't know that I'd expect more at this price."
3,Needs to go a little higher,Very sturdy and easy to use...just wish that it would jack my 2004 Civic up a little higher for more working room under the car.
3,"Good Music , Familiar voice.","This cd has good salsa music. Good tempo and variety of notches in her voice on each song, that's what a true salsero will search for if the artist is not legendary. She seems to have a voice and lyrics similar to the well known salsera ""La India"", the lyrics on this entire album speaks about misfortunes with men. It's like I can't stand him but I love the guy..... situation. So for all you latin ladies that want to deliver a message to your man....... This album will do the job with great spice!"
1,Disappointed,"I suspect if you have liberal inclinations you will love this book; if you're a conservative you'll probably be disappointed. I had high hopes of understanding some of the mechanics of the fed, but found the material vague and scattered. The endless collection of opinions was tiring. If you believe inflation is caused by printing money ask yourself after you've read the book if you can draw that conclusion. If you don't believe it ask yourself how a house that cost $20,000 in the sixties now costs $120,000. How's that possible unless more money was printed? 700 plus pages was simply too much to digest for my tastes on a topic that in my opinion boils down to printing too much money."
4,"Populist, but not bad","A good basic look at how the Fed operates. However, Greider is a bit biased toward the left here, I mean he basically takes the Populist ""rich vs. poor"" stance throughout the entire book. Almost a fan of inflation, Greider does not seem to realize that such an environment stifles any incentive toward investment in the future. Without this investment, the 55% of Americans that Geider believes are the ""victims"" of Federal Reserve Policy would eventually be without jobs.However, all political views aside, the author does an amazing job of putting the operation of the Fed into layman's terms. In addition, the research done to produce this piece is impressive. Again, although I disagree with his politics, this book is worth a read."
5,One of the most significant books of the 90's,"Compelling book which combines a primer on marco economics, the creation, history of, and influence of the Fed, and the history of Paul Volcker's reign as Fed chairman. Should be on every investors must read list. Not only a fascinating tale, but a revealing picture of the issues which shape fiscal policy in America."
3,OK but not recommended,"I purchased this CD based on the other comments. I was not impressed. Unlike the other reviewers, I don't think Palmer's voice is a good fit for the blues. I do not get the impression that he feels the blues. It would be as if Bing Crosby sang the blues. Sorry, I wish I could appreciate this CD as much as the other reviewers, but I just do not get the same feeling from this CD as I do when I listen to other blues masters."
1,Why I like this Breyer Arabian horse,"I like this horse because it is realistic, fun to play with and the right size to fit in my wooden toy barn."
2,Typical Integy Aluminum,"This is typical of Integy aluminum, its all about bling and zero zing. I knew better than to buy Integy parts, as everything I have used before has been worthless. But, these little wheel hex's have been hard to find lately so I jumped at the chance to get another set. Only one in the package fit, the other three had to be drilled to fit."
2,Too Much History for Such a Slim Book,"Unlike the United States, there are thousand year old buildings that are still in use in Great Britain. Any book that calls itself a ""Handbook of British Architectural Styles"" better be prepared to cover a lot of ground. Unfortunately, this slim trade paperback sized book is unequal to the challange. Major styles are adequately described and the locations of interesting buildings are given. A book like this can save itself from being utterly superficial, if the illustrations are noteworthy. The author's quick sketches do not do justice to the buildings they are trying to capture.The greatest books on British architectural history are Nikolaus Pevsner's series ""The Buildings of England."" There is a need for something a lot less intimidating. Sadly, ""British Architectural Styles"" is not that book."
3,"Fits fine at first, but then stretches out a bit too much","When it arrived, I worried that the case wouldn't fit my RAZR. After some finagling, I managed to squeeze it on, and it was nice and snug. But after a few months, it seemed to stretch a bit, and now it doesn't fit as well. The only other downside is that it sort of blocks the camera lens when open, so you have to press the case against the phone to keep it in alignment with the lens. No big deal, just a tad inconvenient. Otherwise, can't beat this price!"
4,Feel Good Fair,"I might be biased as I'm a HUGE McCartney fan, but......this is the best version live or otherwise, of ""Live & Let Die"". Love Badfinger. Love KC & the Sunshine Band. Bought it for Da-Da-Ling-Ling song. (Our family loves this movie) Great soundtrack."
1,"Great product, but DO NOT BUY at this price",This item is only $22 in the store and can be found for a similar price on Amazon. Do not pay over double!!!
2,yohimbe not yohimbine,"This product is bottled and advertised as yohimbine HCL,however this is misleading,according to correspondence with company this product is actually yohimbe bark extract,a much more common product.yohimbine HCL is much stronger than this yohimbe product,but is very difficult to obtain.This is NOT what it says it is."
1,No effect,"No energy, no increased libido, no great tumescence, no decrease in appetite, no increase in metabolism. Could just be my physiology, but this had 0 effect on me even when I doubled the dosage. I tried two different brands now so I am going to conclude that I am immune to Yohimbine."
2,Expiration Date,"I started taking these to help fat loss, then noticed later on that the bottle had an expiration date of 2008. Not sure what to make of this, but I decided to give a 2 star review because nothing was stated about this."
5,This is the most beneficial self-help book I've read.,"This book helped me more than any other self-help book I have read. Not only did it help me learn things about my past and why I have some of the behaviors I have now, it taught me things that I did and did not want for my two young boys. It was very easy to read and understand and described principles I apply to my life daily. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who feels they have a parent or parents that controls their feelings, actions and life."
4,Good Insights - Not enopugh practical advice,"Good insights into the nature of emotional incest. Well written. Definitely worth a read, but falls short on advice as to WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT."
4,The Emotional Incest Syndrome,"This book describes the family dynamics of my family beter than any other I have read. It has helped me understand why I perpetuated the parts of my parenting which harmed me most onto my own children although I promised myself over and over that I would not. Plan to share it with my siblings in an attempt to stop the cycle with this generation. Some of the solutions she offers sound simplistic at first read but as I read further, I found that she was not offering a pat answer to a very difficult issue."
5,Worth the read.,Bought this because my husband and his mother have this issue. Great book for understanding this common problem and how to deal with it.
1,not Ferrara Pan as advertised,"This product was listed as being by Ferrara Pan, but it was not. The brand was Sconza which are not nearly as good or fresh as Ferrara Pan. I sent them back right away."
1,Disappointment,"If you're looking for the original version (by Band Aid) of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"", don't get this CD. The version of the song on this CD is NOT by Band Aid."
1,not the real artists,"I ordered this CD, and was very unhappy to find out that none of the songs were by the original artists."
1,All-Time Football Team After 1966,"A listing of great football players and teams from 1966 onward is just the tip of the iceberg. The reviewers have to eliminate such greats as Red Grange, Tom Harmon, Knute Rockne, Jim Thorpe, Don Hutson, Dixie Howell, Johnny Mack Brown, Doc Blanchard, Glenn Davis, Bobby Layne, Harry Gilmer, Vaughn Mancha, Shorty McWilliams, Barney Poole and hundreds more football greats who played the game merely for the love of it. The book is fine for those who think football began in 1966, but for those of us who remember the real greats it leaves a lot to be desired."
4,"Great product, few nitpicks","I did not buy this on Amazon but instead found it for $130 on another website. Unfortunately, I don't have USB 2.0, but the unit works fine and speedier than I expected on my USB 1.1. The only problems I had with this are the extremely bright blue led light that can get very annoying if it's in your line of site (i.e. if you use it with a laptop like me), and the slightly imperfect connections for the USB and power (the USB was a little difficult to get all the way in and the power felt a little loose). Otherwise it's a solid, quiet product that deserves the four stars I gave it."
2,Quality control?,"Yes, my HDD died, stopped spinnin, data go bye-bye. I rated it two stars because I fault myself for not backing up my backup drive. The drive does not work well with Firewire- over its short life it often could not be recognized by my PC (running XP). I would unplug it, plug it in again and that usually did the trick ... until it didn't. Now I'm scrambling to find my data from other sources."
3,Interesting Reading but.....,"This is my first review so it might sound wierd, anyway. I read this book in Borders bookstore, so before you consider buying the book think about the pages you have to read for the amount you have to pay. I think it's a good book to read while someone is on their launch break but that's it. It's 48 pages but I read the whole book in less than a half hour. They do have a CD but most of the songs on their I already heard so it's not worth me paying that much money. Just think about it before you buy. It's a good book, interesting to read but not worth 15.95 in the bookstore or 12.95 here."
2,Too much romance !,"I am new to astrology and recently purchased the Cosmic Grooves book on my sign,Aquarius. The book gives a brief overview of the Aquarian personality, but nothing that I had not read before. My main complaint is that 26 of the 47 pages are dedicated to describing every possible romantic combination between Aquarians and the other signs. If this information interests you, you might find the book worth your while, but I don't think it's worth the asking price. I bought my copy for $3, mainly because I think the CD is a clever idea and I like some of the songs on it. I agree with the previous reviewer; if you're really interested in astrology, invest your money in something more substantial."
4,I liked it,"Similar to other books in this series. This one was a little quirky than others. Lots of fun. If you like other books in this series, this is probably for you."
4,Good basic mystery,"This book introduces us to Dr. Gideon Oliver, forensic anthropologist. In this one he is a visiting teaching fellow in Germany. He is attacked in his room and so starts a challenging few months as he is almost killed, his room is burglarized, and he tries to unravel the mystery along with a NATO cop. His ability to tell something about someone with anthropology is amazing. Interesting mystery and writing. A bit sensual in places and a few curse words, but overall fairly clean."
3,Spy versus spy,"This is the first book of Aaron Elkins' ""Skeleton Detective"" series, and sleuth Gideon Oliver, abroad in Europe, gets bashed about quite a bit. (Beating up the detective is one of Elkins' favorite tactics in his series about museum curator Chris Norgren.) As the first novel with a new protagonist, it's a slightly uneasy mixture of spy thriller and forensic anthropology, but it's fun to read, and a pleasure to meet Oliver's sidekick, Hawaiian cop John Lau, for the first time. Elkins doesn't telegraph his intentions, and the showdown is well-handled."
5,Summary,"Black & white and a few color plates covering a broad range of material, from hollywood celebs to midwest farmers, from Soweto township to the youth of Vietnam, from a montage of clips from Court TV to Weber's trademark look at the All-American boy. Don't miss this one."
4,I can't believe I cryed...,"The pictures were all fairly nice. But what got to me, was the stories, ""Prettest girl in town."" the one about the three kdis going out and branding them self with a sword. They were touching in their betrail of human life and want. I couldent have dremt for more of a sadistic, masicistic beautiful book. I read it when i was in Backbone state park with friends, her boyfriend had bought her the book. We were sitting around the campfire reading it all i could thing was...thats what I want in life."
2,"Too many subjects, Very confusing category!","Bruce Weber should have concentrated on just one subject, ""young men"". His photography is more dramatic emphasizing young men with great bodies. I think he should make a book just for them. Not male models but ordinary young men with great bodies!"
1,Re-gift,"it was purchased as a gift and rec'd it the day before i had to give it. The box looked like it was a return, did not new and when opened there was a plastic bag balled up on the belt and one of the pcs were loose in the box. I will remember Perfect Solutions and avoid buying from them again"
1,poor quality,"When I opened the box and spread the bag sleeping bag out, I noticed that it had very little loft, even after shaking it. So I looked at the fill content label and it reads ""65% polyester and 35% cotton"". No wonder it was flat! Can you imagine this bag getting damp? Would it ever dry out? Is cotton considered insulation--no! And this bag has a 20 degree temp rating. Must be celsius and not F. I immediately re-packaged the sleeping bag and filled out the return card. Well, it was low priced and I learned a lesson from this. You get what you pay for..."
2,Not what I ordered,"Like some of the other reviewers, I ordered the Illuminator but was sent the Dynamo instead. I ordered the Illuminator because I had seen it in a store and know the quality. I am not at all satisfied with the substitution that I received! With the Illuminator you have the option of turning on one light or all three. When you push the button on the Dynamo it clicks like it should be turning on the light but it takes 3 ""clicks"" to get the light to turn on!! I have never had a problem like this when ordering through Amazon but would recommend looking elsewhere if you are specifically looking for the Illuminator, because that's not what you are going to receive!"
2,Item received not as shown- Bait and Switch !!!,I received the Smart tool Dynamo instead of the Illuminator. Very disappointed because I ordered 5 for Xmas gifts and do not have enough time to reorder.
1,Tree Bark Photo Album,"If you live in a damp environment, this little book will grow on you - literally. The twigs and branches that are so endearing at first tend to crinkle and fall off if left in a dry room for a while. Stick with a traditional photo album - less mess!"
4,Pro Combo is exactly what this is...PRO!,"I was very leary ordering this monitor online because I hate returning things that I didn't buy at a local store. However, I WON'T BE returning this monitor any time soon. It is more than I expected and I am thrilled with it already. It was easy to put together, even though the directions were not clear. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it only comes with an average adult cuff. I deal with alot of ""above"" average clients and need the extra large cuff. It is going to cost almost as much for the extra large cuff and shipping as it did for the entire ProCombo monitor and stethascope. So I can only pray that it is the correct size and fit for this palm gauge. Well worth the investment, top quality so far.American Diagnostic Corporation 788-641o Pro's Combo Iii Palm, Orange, Adult"
1,"Do not purchase, a bad product for safety that defeats purpose","My first scraper arrived and would not open. I was sent another and that one also would not open or close. The metal is flimsy, the workmanship is from an assembly line in the Asia, and it's a FAIL.I bought this item to protect my fingers from a razor blade catching as I scrape and take off decals. I felt less safe with this item, feeling the metal would either quickly bend or snap quickly. Item was thrown away."
1,conspiratory drivel,"This was a horrible read. To call the writing and grammar simplistic is akin to calling Al Gore moderatley liberal. I am as conservative as they come, but this is not conservative, it is extremist, paranoid, conpiracy-theorist drivel. This book actually makes me embarassed of my pro-gun, pro-freedom, anti-big government feelings. I hate to have the opinions of conservatives being put forth in such a mealy-mouthed, ignorant manner. If this is indicative of this guys work, I cannot believe he has published as many books as he has."
4,Excellent purchase,"The book I purchased, although used, was in excellent shape. Arrived in a timely manner and the cost was relatively cheap."
3,Disappointing overall.,"The storyline of Hunted is terrific and the characters are fascinating. The book was bogged down though over and over by the author's views of government and politics. While we all have our opinions and concerns of today's government and the restrictions being put on us as citizens, Johnstone just crammed his down our throats. The story actually became secondary to the author's political views."
4,Great game for your money,"Hey folks....no dumb story here, no waiting, no thinking, justshoot shoot and do it good as you have 59 more levels.The game starts easy, but gets harder as your screen fills up withhundreds + hundreds of soldiers, tanks and others trying to get yaBeing a man with little game patience i was able to enjoy thisshooter, and i could' nt stop playing (within 2 months) till allthe levels were done....This is the first game that i fullycompleted.....Thats why i think that cheapo Valusoft hit it good on this one."
5,Excellent,Contains such things as Bhudda predicting that there would come another & better teaching to replace his teaching 500 years after his death. 500 years later came Jesus Christ. Documented & foot-noted to a 'T'. Every Christian should read this book.
3,The economics of policy,"'Trade-offs' is a good introduction to the economic analysis of policy, with a message clearly conveyed by its title: There are trade-offs for every (public) policy. Excellent for explaining economic analysis to people with little background in economics.Disagree with the previous reviewer's comparison with Freakonomics: Though both are good, Freakonomics describes things that are at the frontier of current economic research (in an amazingly clear way). So, Freakonomics offers both clarity and novelty, while (at least for most people educated in economics), Trade-Offs mostly offers the former.I would have given Trade-Offs a four star, but I think it is a bit too short for the money."
2,"Fun, I guess","Walter Farely's Flame is a loved character for many people, but the model of the Island Stallion is not as good as it could be, in my opinion. The model makes him look a bit fat. He is more of somthing to look at, rather then play with. If you have a Black Stallion/ Island Stallion loving child, the toy is fine, but the parent of a regular horse crazy kid might consider somthing that one can actually put a bridle on."
5,Walter Farley's Flame Come To Life,"Flame from Breyer is a very neat toy, and he is very durable. The effort made into this toy has made him very lifelike. I have read the book, too, and I love the way Walter Farley writes. Flame is in just the right pose, because he looks alittle aggressive, and that is how the real Flame acts."
4,Works like advertised,Not much to go wrong here unless the blades fall off. That hasn't happened yet so I don't have anything to complain about its functionality.
4,Comprehensive supplementary reference,"Don't try to learn anything for the first time from this. In each of the book's 54 sections, information is delivered as bulleted lists of definitions and theorems (called ""facts"") and there are extensive references to the literature. To maximize brevity, there is seldom any narrative introduction and only a few brief examples. No proofs, just references to them.I noted two significant gaps in coverage. Since the main application of graph theory is in computer science, much of the Handbook relates to that field, yet there is no chapter on computational complexity. The other absent topic is scale-free graphs."
3,Nothing more than a handbook,"As the title indicates, this is not a textbook, but a handbook. The interest of this one is to have pointers to the literature and to cover as much as possible of graph theory, so don't expect to find much details about something particular. I don't think it's useful for anything else than having a ""close to hand"" access to most of graph theory, hence only three stars for this limited interest compared to the relatively high price."
4,Great Item,"Very happy with this item. Sturdy and easy to assemble. I like the adjustable shelves, although I thought the top and bottom adjustment heights were too close to the top and the bottom. This cabinet is great because you can lock it - just be careful to buy a lock with a longer opening. I bought a smaller one and It wasn't big enough to fit around the lock holes and be able to close the lock. Would highly recommend this cabinet. It looks nice too."
1,Suncast Base Cabinet C3600G,"Suncast Utility Base Cabinet C3600GThis cabinet is not nearly the quality of the Suncast cabinet I purchased years ago. The doors hang up when opening and closing. The top has no support and pushes down on the doors when anything is set on it. I trusted the Suncast name but sorry, this product is a disappointment."
3,Mixed reviews,"Pro's: Relatively easy to assemble. Affordable.Con's: Despite ability to lock, cabinet could easilybe entered by simply unsnapping a panel."
5,Nice point driver,"I make custom picture frames. This device makes mounting the glass, matting, pictuer and backing a breeze."
2,mixed results,"Over the past year or so, I have purchased two of these FrameMaster 07-500 point drivers, but with mixed results. The first one worked well for about a year, then I gave it to my aunt as she wanted to do her own framing. I recently purchased the second one, but it only fires about 20 percent of the points correctly. Even in soft wood, most of the points barely penetrate the wood. Adjusting the main spring tension did not help. I read the instructions carefully and made sure I was using the correct points (Fletcher framer's points 08-950).I called the manufacturer, but they refused to offer warranty service and said I had to return it to Amazon. The manufacturer suggested the push plate might be damaged, so I disassembled the driver and inspected it; there was no obvious damage. Since these point drivers are made in China, I suspect there's a quality control problem. For what it's worth, the date of manufacture on the defective driver was 23 March 2012."
5,Must have for framing!,This is a great thing to have if you have lots of picture frames and you like to change the pictures out often. This tool tacks your picture or artwork back into the frame. It's so easy!
4,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZF41W/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title,"Just purchased this product and have only used it twice, but it has been satisfactory and performed adequately for my needs. It only has four stars because of the limited usage to date."
1,to weak to work,Didn't have the power to hit the point into my frames even at the strongest setting.
5,Frame at home and save money,This product is easy to use and works well. It is saving me a lot of money on framing. I find that I use it more than I thought that I would.
1,Problematic,"I purchased the Point Driver as a professional photographer doing much of my own framing. I was disappointed that the driver never fired with enough force to secure the points in the frame. I braced the frame against a surface and adjusted the tension as tight as could be yet never received satisfactory results. In fact, despite how tight I adjusted the tension, the pointer never fired differently. I do not use 'hard wood' or any materials that would be difficult to penetrate. Each time I used my Fletcher point driver I had to push points in with a flathead screwdriver by hand to secure them in the wood and keep them from falling out when the frame was lifted. Very disappointing, particularly with the price tag."
5,Solid tool that survives the studio,"I use this point driver in a photography studio and it works quite well. It is well made, easy to use and does what it's intended to do. I plan to purchase one for framing my own photography work."
4,For the hiring manager but also the job seeker,Good book to use as the hiring manager or as the job seeker. As a job seeker it helps to prepare you for a wide array of questions. It really opens up your mind and builds confidence going into the interview.
4,Good and easy read,Clear sample interview questions with concise analysis on the variety of answers for each questions.Valuable info with an easy read.
3,Good for prepping for an interview,"I bought this to help prepare myself for a job interview, and it was very helpful in thinking about the questions I would be asked. It is written for HR folks, but was easy to read and understand."
4,Great insider tips,"I am a college grad so naturally i am looking for tips on interviews. this book is great, it explains the do's and don'ts and they why's and how's. It's not really for a graduating student, since there's only one small section for that, but it's great to have for the future and there are a lot of related questions"
3,Ok I think,"Not what I thought it would be, but I can use it. I was looking for more job specific questions."
5,Essential for all educators of children with PDD,"This book provides clear, easy to use strategies for teaching and communicating with children on the autism spectrum. The author's contend that behavioral problems exhibited by children with autism are most often the result of frustration that comes from their inability to communicate effectively. Behavioral problems can be successfuly addressed by focusing on what the child is trying to communicate. Rationale for the strategies suggested is provided. I recommend this book for educators and parents."
5,A Tribute Worthy of a Noble Thoroughbred,Breyer planned to sculpt this mold long before its merchandising deal with the Seabiscuit marketeers. Why? War Admiral was a Triple Crown Winner with impeccable breeding and a bloodline that has achieved greater immortality than Seabiscuit. Breyer makes a substantial investment in its model horses and therefore chooses only the best of the best. This model does justice to a horse that did much more than lose to Seabiscuit.
2,Why can't we let Erik rest?,"Perhaps it's my bias towards Susan Kay's Phantom, but I did not find this book nearly as enjoyable as others I have read.Do I regret buying it? No. This is an excellent addition to the library of any Phantom fan. But it can only be enjoyed if you were left wondering what might have happened next after reading either Leroux's or Kay's versions.Erik died. And it just seems to me that this was written, not out of a love for the characters, but to further comercialize a classic story. It flowed to much like a romance novel for my tastes, excessively dramatic, with extravagant language to disguise a weak plot.I guess I just don't like happy endings to classic tragedies."
1,Horrible,"This book was horrible. I felt like I was reading a very bad soap opera. Also, who did the editing and checking in this book? Being a proofreader, I was horrified at how bad the spelling and grammer was.If you want to read a better Phantom book, read Susan Kaye's wonderful ""Phantom""."
1,"Ouch! Move on to something else, O Phantom Phans!","This was a painful read. Never mind that the writing style was inane, but the grammatical errors (such as the author's inability to use homonyms properly) left me cold. One does NOT ""have a rye smile on their face."" Perhaps that is more the editor's fault (or lack thereof)...Errors such as this continued in the ""sequel"" - ""Phantasy"". Do not waste your money on either book.Instead, buy Susan Kay's ""Phantom"" - an utterly spellbinding book from start to finish."
3,PhanFiction Romance Sequel.,"Good premise initially. Christian was the only character developed/interesting enough to encourage the reader to complete the book. Preferred more descriptive locations/historical references/significances as in Susan Kay's novel & Sherlock Holmes meets the Phantom of the Opera(no comparison). Pretty costly @$35 for romance paperback novel(very poor quality cover/paper/too large print)that had long delivery wait.Re-edit required for grammar/spelling/typecast. Preferred hardcover, but unavailable.Nice addition to expensive romance book collection."
1,Progeny review,"The storyline was interesting. The writing was horrendous. The syntax was that of a child. Christine was described as weak, whiny, and indecisive.It was difficult to get through as the book just doesn't grab you and carry you along. If it was written differently; more descriptive, more action, less whiny ""I need to be saved female"", it has the potential to be a great story. But as is, I would not waste my money on this. After the original story and movie this is a big let down."
2,I had low expectations...,"I bought this book after reading the reviews of other readers. I had low expectations going into it, seeing that quite a few people didn't think highly of this book. I had hoped to be surprised but the book didn't even meet my low standards. It was like the author had 6 ideas for a scene and then, instead of picking one, she told all six! This makes for a VERY repetitive read. Yes, Erik loved Christine, Christine loved Erik, Christine was in torment, she was in pain, she and Erik had given each other their souls! Yes I got that the first 20 times. But to repeat the same phrases on EVERY SECOND PAGE? WAYYYYYY too redundant. So I was dissapointed. It was a decent idea, just told poorly. If you want to read a REALLY good PTO book, get Susan Kay's Phantom. It was told much better and the characters were more likeable."
1,Progeny,"I'm so disappointed in this book that I should be the one gnashing my teeth and beating my [chest] instead of the characters. Ms. Meadows took a really wonderful story and turned it into a third rate romance novel. The basic plot would have made a wonderful book in the hands of Susan Kay, who wrote Phantom. Do yourself a favor if you're thinking of buying this book and run the other way. Look for Phantom instead... it's everything this book tries to be but fails. I, for one, am sorry I wasted my money on Progeny."
5,THIS IS A WONDERFUL READ!!,"Wow, Phantom phans--this book is a must read! :) This book powerfully combines the writing techniques of romance, mystery, and gothic horror fiction. Meadows spins a tale of love, mystery, and woe that will leave you breathless and crying at the end. If you haven't treated yourself to this book, you owe it to yourself to do so! This is one of the few books I have read that actually paints a picture of Erik that is like my own, and Christine in this work has more power than in any other Phantom-related text I have read. Great job!!! :)"
1,Erik is dead.,"It confuses me to see so many professed ""fans"" of Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera who exalt a tale that goes against the very fabric of Leroux's original intent. May I remind those customers whose copy of the original novel needs a good dusting, the last sentence Leroux penned was ""Erik is dead."" If Erik is dead, his sequel is not justified."
1,Save your Money- Never Read!!!,"What a waste of time an money this book has been. I mean, I had been a dedicated Phatnom fan up to the point I read (and bought, Heaven All Mighty) this crap. Now, Mrs. Meadows has made me turn the whole way round: I'm about to be a Raoul fan.When we buy fanfic, we want to read something NEW and ORIGINAL. A thing which makes fan fic and sequels pretty difficult to write.The characters in Meadow's book cry all the time, express their emotions in exaggerating ways all the time. Erik has to prove that he is a majestic mysterious figure in almost every paragraph and Christine passes out at a 'booo'. Christian talks and thinks like a woman and poor Raoul has-to-be-the-bad-guy-no-matter-what. Horrible pastime."
2,Not Pleased,"Purhcased this 29-Nov-2004. Retruned it 30-Nov-2004. Text was fuzzy , Pixelation issues. Bought it as an open item got a great deal. Even the DVD's did not seem that clear. Might have been a defective unit - but completley unacceptable for my set up (Satellite receiver with Monster S-Video high end cable).Purhcased a SHARP LC-20B6U-S instead. While the SHARP was twice the price it is 100 times better."
3,Entertaining,"Great cast and an interesting interpretation of the story. It was not my favorite version of the story, but it was entertaining."
4,Nice film. The streaming version is 1:33 with a 30 minute Sherlock Holmes episode.,"I enjoy Agatha Christie works and adaptations. As such, this does not disappoint. Great character actors. I just watched the DigiComTV streaming version in the player on my computer. The picture was fine in the small format, but was somewhat wobbly, particularly at the beginning. This would probably be more noticeable on a larger screen. It should be noted that Amazon is currently attaching Ron Howard's Sherlock Holmes episode ""The Mother Hubbard Case"" onto the end of the streaming movie. It's an average episode from that series."
4,I watch this as a kid in school,"When I was little, my class read the book by Agatha Christie and then we watched the movie after and it has stuck with me as a good book and movie ever since! I love being able to find the great old movies on DVD so I can share my childhood memories with my kids!"
4,"Great show, obviously inspired by . . .","This is my favorite episode, and I'm pretty sure it was inspired by Edmond Hamilton's short story, ""The Man Who Evolved,"" published in 1931. You can read it in either Isaac Asimov's ""Before the Golden Age"" anthology or ""The Best of Edmond Hamilton."" Both books are, unfortunately, *long* out of print, but a good used copy should be easy to find."
5,Worth the price.,"I already own two and plan to buy another Stokke Kinderzeat, now that my toddler keeps climbing up to use her siblings' chairs. The chairs are easy to clean and easy on the eyes to look at. They match my decor well, and I have no trouble saying they will remain permanent furniture in my house. The kids like having their own chairs and love the footrests, which also allows them to stand and reach things on the table."
5,A Great Read - An Easy Gift,"I am buying this book as a stocking stuffer and for every secret santa, grab bag party I'm attending this season. It's a great book and it's practically free (what is it, like 10 bucks?).The book was given to me by someone in my office who knows I love dogs. Every page, I laughed and nodded ""yeah, that IS how a dog would see that""? It's really funny and perceptive and if you are a dog person or just like reading about relationships, you will love this book."
5,What a wonderful book!,"This is a book I could not put down. A perspective of life and human psychology seen through the eyes of Bala, a Doberman cross. A must to read for doglovers and everyone who wants to understand this world. Highly recommended.. give it away to friends on any occasion."
4,It is what it is,Good reference for those rare occasions when you need to be able to use a [insert dead Frenchman's name] function.
4,A good review of topics,"This book goes through all the basics needed to master advanced mathematics. It covers differential equations; linear differential equations; Laplace transformations; vector analysis; multiple, line and surface integrals with the theorems; Fourier series and integrals; gamma and beta functions, Bessel functions, Legendre and othhogonal functions, partial differential equations, complex variables and conformal mapping, complex inversion formula (for Laplace transformations); and matrices. At the beginning is also a review of the basic terms and rules.This is a good book to review to refresh your memory of what you studied in school. If you are in school now, this will be a good supplement. As with other books in this series, there are problems you can work to test your knowledge, but not all of them have the answers printed in the book. This is a little bothersome, but the book is still worth the investment."
3,worth the purchase,"I used this book as a text for an applied math course. The presentation of the book is well done. The emphasis was on gaining competency through practice and not on proving rigorous theories per se (though some of that is included). The author worked out in detail many example problems that I found to be helpful.As a caveat, there were MANY typos in the book. A few of the theorems were even stated incorrectly. Some of the answers in the back of the book are incorrect. For at least one homework problem that I know of you are tasked with proving something that is just plain wrong. The end result: lots of wasted time. I found the treatment of linear algebra to be a little outdated; he focuses mainly on properties of determinants and inverses, which these days is not the way to approach applied linear algebra.I'm more forgiving of these blunders because the book is low priced. All in all it was helpful to me as an aid to learning."
5,best warped tour cd,"This cd rules!!! I love punk rock just because of this cd. The very 1st song is definately my fav, on the 1st cd. Listen to the sample, its great. Instead of telling you why to buy this, i'll give the songs that make this cd 1 of my all time favorites.CD 11-THE SUICIDE MACHINES-your silence*2-THE USED-just a little3-NOFX-glass war*4-LESS THAN JAKE-asaok5-FACE TO FACE-anybody listening6-YELLOWCARD-finish line7-STAIRWELL-boxcar*8-S.T.U.N.-the movement9-AVOID ONE THING-pop punk band*CD 21-DROPKICK MURPHYS-walk away2-THE CASUALTIES-made in nyc*3-SIMPLE PLAN-you don't mean anything4-THE UNSEEN-false hope5-THE BRIGGS-. . .(?)6-ALLISTER-somewhere on fullerton*7-MAD CADDIES-drinking for 118-AUTHORITY ZERO-solitude**=really, really good songsNow those are my fav songs, but i bet you'll find ur own fav's. There are 52 punk songs on this album, which totally makes it worth 8 bucks. PLZ RATE THIS HELPFUL!!! thanx 4 your time"
3,Well...,"I bought this cd because there were several bands I liked and lots of others I had heard of on it, plus it was really cheap. I was not dissappointed by the bands I knew. Disc 1 has great songs by The Used, Thrice, Rufio, Yellowcard, Senses Fail, Story of the Year, Matchbook Romance, The Early November, and Taking Back Sunday. The others on the first disc are good with the exception of a few (Tsunami Bomb, Kicked in the Head, S.T.U.N.). Disc 2 however, is the opposite. It has only a few tracks that really stood out to me, (Bouncing Souls, Rise Against, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Allister, Coheed and Cambria) but even they aren't great. Overall the set is well worth the money."
4,I Should Have Been There,"I got this at a yard sale because I was interested in the genre of music. The genre of this album is really more than I expected, though. I was expecting a lot of punk songs that sounded the same. But what it really is is a lot of different genres mixed into one thing called alternative. There are all kinds of music on this. There are 52 songs by 52 different artists. There were a couple songs that weren't great and I don't think I would have enjoyed live, but there were a lot of songs that really catchy. There are a lot of small name bands on this various artists mix, but there are also some big names like Yellowcard and Story of the Year. Altogether, I thought this was a good CD and definitely worth my time. I also think that any punk, metal or just plain rock fan should posess it."
4,It would've been better without the profanity.,"This compilation was great, Warped Tour has been pulling through faithfully for the past few years coming out with summer compilations. & this year's is even bigger than last year's, with over 50 songs, that's 2 more than last year. The compilation as a whole is pretty good, but not the tracks with profanity, I know that some of those ""Big Tough Punk Rockers"" have to use profanity to be what they think is ""Hardcore Punk."" But, I'll tell you right now, that you don't have to use foul language to get acceptance from your punk rock peers. But, besides the disappointing tracks, we heard from our favorite bands: NOFX, Taking Back Sunday, The Used, Thrice, Jackson, Senses Fail, The Early November, Death By Stereo, Audio Karate, Dropkcik Murphys, & Maxeen. Some we're hearing for the first time, some we're just glad to hear from again. I give this album 4 stars, but if you like a few tracks with potty mouth lyrics, this album would be 5 stars in your book."
2,i didnt like it.,"First off, some of the bands from warped arent even on here. Second even though the cd was only about 7 bucks i dont think its that great. I bought it about 3 months ago i only listened to it once, and even then i was skipping songs. You can definatly find a better various punk cd to buy."
2,Do publishers not have editors any more?,"This is a very ambitious book and it delivers on a great deal of what the reader expects from the title. The author's belief is that commitment and monogamy are existentially healthier for people--including gay men--than are promiscuity and transient relationships. But if the text had been edited to eliminate the tiresomely tendentious jargon and an exasperating amount of repetition, we could have a 60-page article that was a pleasure to read and a mine of information and provocative insight. Instead of ""author! author!"" I want to cry, ""editor! editor!"""
2,OK fun read but not for the pro!,"This book is OK for a bit of ""boy's own"" adventure stories but for the gambling pro not too valuable.I knew one of the participants and their modus operandi. What is reported here may have been what the author gleaned from talking to this person but he ought to have realized a serious pro is not going to give the shop away. Some of the purported information is either flaky or has yawning gaps which suggests little independent research by the author.For example writing about the ""Harvel"" formula and ""Henri Stearns"" in his piece on Alan Woods is risible.Writing about Alan Woods and not mentioning his early partner Bill Benter who Woods took to Hong Kong and bankrolled is a major gap in the narrative. There is a much more interesting story in how they collaborated in blackjack initially then moved to Hong Kong to bet the horses on the advice of a Sydney punter and how the partnership foundered after a couple of years."
3,It is a fiction. Don't expect to find the secrets of the professional gamblers.,"Do not expect this book to tell you anything about how the professional gamblers bet or what they perceive the right betting strategy is or how money management is about. This book is just some kind of fiction. By adopting a question-answer or interview approach, this book reveals how those professional gamblers started his/her first betting, how they became professional gamblers and what their interesting experiences were. This book is more of a leisure reading."
3,Spode Glass Pitcher,"Spode ""Christmas Tree"" Glass Pitcher, 96 oz.I received the pitcher today. Although it was made of very heavy glass, I was disappointed that there were noticeable bubbles in the glass. One bubble was quite distinct, on the front of the pitcher, near the Christmas tree design. The pitcher is lovely, I just wish it didn't have the bubble flaws in it."
2,Disssapointed,I loved the pitcher when I got it - it held alot and was just what I was looking for. Until - 1 week later a LARGE CRACK all around the handle appeared! I had to send it back- wasn't taking the chance of the handle falling off in my hand with liquid in it - Amazon took it back no problems but I sure was dissapointed.I think the handle can't take the weight/size of the pitcher or that this particular pitcher was just deffective
1,You get what you pay for,"This product was a bit cheaper than in the dept stores. I bought it on Black Friday and it arrived a week later. I didn't need to open the box to hear the shards, the pitcher was smashed. I returned it through amazon and had another shipped. This one arrived right before Xmas with big bubble in the front of it. We used it since we would not be able to get another before the holiday. Beware of what you get in these sales."
1,The Merlin of St. Gilles' Well,"The sole basis for this book's theme, Margaret Murray's theories of a pagan ""witch cult"" to which numerous historical figures were claimed to belong, is thoroughly discredited and rejected by both historians and most modern pagans alike. Historians have long pointed out that Joan of Arc did not belong to such a cult, and the events in this book likewise bear little resemblance to history.In terms of writing style and ambiance, this is largely standard fantasy, albeit with prose which is somewhat more over-the-top than the norm."
3,"Beautiful story, but can be upsetting","I was excited to get this book for my 6-year-old daughter who loves horses. The pictures and story are sweet. I thought my daughter's imagination would soar with the idea of her own sleep pony. She was eager for me to read the book to her the night she received it and couldn't wait to get to sleep. THEN the problem began. She kept waking and was crying at 2 am because she was certain she didn't have a sleep pony. Her upset continued over a few weeks, then she had a dream that her sleep pony was hurt and couldn't come to her. Best of intentions gone bad for our house."
5,wonderful read!,"I am a huge fan of Bickmore's ""East of the Sun"" and have been reading her other novels for the past few weeks. I have to say that this one is so different than her period pieces. It is set in Texas for one so its very different than say the jungle from ""East"" or China in ""Distant Star"". I enjoyed this book so much. It was intersting to see her take on a story based in the USA. I would highly suggest this book for reading. I wanted the book to go on and on. I cannot say enough about this book. It was a great book and I was sad when it ended!"
5,Mind-erasingly fantastic.,"The HP Lovecraft Historical Society (www.cthulhulives.org) has accomplished something truly wonderful here. The production-that-never-should-have-been, written by HE WHO (for legal reasons) MUST NOT BE NAMED, truly a perfect gift for the lover of eldritch horror in your life. Consider buying the libretto from the society as well."
1,Commercial rip-off,"The described walks are sponsored by commercial enterprises. The book amounts to a series of advertisements. The only 'maps' offered are less than two inch rectangles showing the towns or cities that might be named in the hike. Since the commercial tour leaders themselves provide free, more detailed, and dramatically photographed books, this one amounts to a rip-off. It is farily useless for the independent traveler"
5,Another excellent resource for raising kids!,"If you are looking for an answer to specific problems, read this and the other 2 in the series."
1,UnChristian Cruelty,"I don't know which is more digusting, that someone would advise treating children so cruelly in the first place or that they would smear Jesus Christ and Christianity by doing it in Christ's name. Pearl, who has no training in child care or development whatsoever, advises beating infants on the bare skin with sticks for crying! Not only is this alien to the teachings of Jesus, but also to everything that modern science tells us produces happy, healthy, obedient children. Read the Bible (the whole thing people), read modern science, but avoid this vicious quackery like the plague! Shame on Amazon for selling a book like this and shame on them for removing reviews that are critical of it."
1,The ROD is meant to GUIDE not BEAT!!!!!,"I am apalled that any parent would think it's ok to flick, smack or hit their child for age appropriate behavior. Especially when their child is only a BABY!! Do you really think that a baby learns when you smack him? NO!! He only learns that the person he loves most in the world is HITTING him! Jesus would never hit a child!!!This book is disgusting child abuse - plain and simple. SICK!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!Your child(ren) will thank you that you didn't buy this book!"
5,"Finally, my kids obey joyfully",This is a great book that should be required reading for all parents. It is well written with a great sense of humor. If you want great and happy kids read and apply this book.
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this book and it frankly scared me with their techniques. If you read it, really say to yourself..what would jesus do? I did, and I know he would not do what these people say to do to your child. Please do not be led astray. God gave us a brain to develop society and that includes understanding childhood development. There are ways to raise your child in a positive light with positive gentle discipline. Please look into it before resorting to this method. The key is consistency, not hitting. Hitting instills fear and humiliation, neither what I believe Jesus wants to see. People who do this will have to answer to God for hitting his creation. I am a conservative christian that views children as coming from God and given to us for a short time on this earth for them to do God's work, not for me to guide them by hitting."
1,How-To Book on Amazon Promoting Child Abuse????,"Beating children as a way to discipline them? Pulling babies hair and then whacking them with a stick? This is what this horrible book promotes. I'm sickened by the thought that this book and the others written by the Pearls are being sold on Amazon. If someone were caught beating a dog in this fashion, they'd be arrested. If they were caught beating an ADULT in this fashion they'd be arrested. But a helpless newborn? I'm sickened by anyone who goes along with these teachings."
3,Don't always count on the stock pic!,"This totally looked different than the stock pic. It is skinny at the front, not wide like on the generic stock pic. This order was for a 2003-2011 Chevy Express or GMC Savana van."
4,Live at the Blue Note,I was lucky to have seen Dori on 7/13/00 at the Blue Note in New York City. He played a couple songs from Cinema and knocked our socks off (Pink Panther and a song from a James Bond Movie). Plus playing some originals from his collection and Jobim classics!!! Was a great evening!
2,"Careful, Dori Fans","Dori has always walked the tightrope with gentle sensuousness on one side and cloying fuzak on the other. I'm afraid he fell onto the wrong side with this one, but I have every confidence he will get back up ""where he belongs"". How's that for pompous?"
2,Red runs,Loved the shirt and size was good. Washed it in cold water by itself and hung up to dry . When went back was horrified that the red dye in the letters had run down making a bit of a mess. Most of it finally came out next washing but still a little stained.
2,Yuck Yuck Yeehaww,"I've never been to kansas, but I live in Texas, and its annoying how some people think everyone rides horses and wears cowboy hats and voted for president Bush. Not so people! So I'm assuming the the re-dunkulous stuff they do in this mind numbing book is pretty far feteched too. Now Im a huge fan of the fluff SVH stories, but I found this one tormenting. Skip onto one of the other Super Eds., cus this book is Special Ed."
1,Long Load Times,Between every screen is a 25 second load time. This is demoralizing to say the least - especially given all of the screens that one has to cycle through. It is truly absurd. I recommend virtual tennis.
3,Topspin 1 Better,I think topspin 1 was much better than this one. The online features aren't nearly as entertaining and that's the main reason I bought 2.
4,Still the best tennis game ever made,I got this game 4 days ago and I like the fact that they didn't change anything on the game they did add some more players like Venus Williams but Serena isn't on here the graphics are cool their not 2 far off from top spin 1 but graphics don't make the game the controls are smooth they twicked them a little but if you know how to play top spin you can get used 2 it in career mode after you create a player you have to do weeks of training before you can actually play a tournament its still the fun game all the modes are there and the price is reasonable well worth ya money at $39.99 if you have a 360 this is a must have especially if you like sport games picked this up you want be disapointed
1,bad description,This is falsely advertised. These are cereal bowls. I had them replace and they sent cereal bowls again. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,sometimes the most simple is the hardest to solve,"I will say that the product itself is not so bad, I believe that resistance is good but the tape that is the most important is bad. internal cotruccion not work well.irwin comp makes good tools but this does not pass them. I think a simple tape measure was too much for them, I only use 3 times and broke down, I believe that they need work more in this failure.its a just measure tape. irwin comp"
1,HORRIBLE DISPOSABLE GARBAGE!!,Avoid this tape at all costs. It will work for a few months and then will stop retracting...had to throw it away after only a few dozen uses.
5,Very well built,"I have broken many tape measures, usually in the first few days of owning them. But this thing held up great. I dropped it off of 10ft ladders, off of roofs, it's fallen out of trucks, been left out in the rain and snow. The only problem that I had with is was the clip screw stripped the plastic and the clip broke off, as ALL clips seem to do. A dab of Guerrilla Glue and it was all good. The tape is very strong and very easy to read. It held up great for almost a year, but now it sits in someones attic somewhere... So I'm getting a new one. If you abuse tape measures, this is the tape measure for you!"
2,Wrought With Wind-Up Problems,"Not unlike other reviewers, initial use of this tape measure lead me to believe that a company had finally produced a real tape measure. Small drops did not seem to affect it, but after several months the recoil spring mechanism failed; making it so the tape cannot be drawn back into the case. Irwin's basic concept is terrific. If they can rectify this problem, I would purchase more."
2,like walking a brick,"I just got it this thing thinking that it might be a quality product....the bad:brand new and fresh out of the packaging, during the first hour of use reeled it out three times to check elevations of ductwork, the third time it stops retracting leaving like 10 inches to push back in (like all the time it must be manually pushed back in, it is an annoying new feature). Made my already loaded toolbelt feel heavier by lunch.the good:has a 10 ft standout comparable to the stanley fax max.Verdict: FAT MAX wins!"
2,nice features but not the best,"The Irwin Tape measure has a lot of cool features. The little pencil thing is awesome and underneath there is a little button to hold it in place instead of locking it. Looks pretty cool as well. But its not the best. It's pretty heavy compared with most 25' tapes. The first 12"" is divided into 32ths and not 16ths, so its a little hard to read if you're measuring something less than a foot. The double sided tape doesn't really make much of a difference. After a few weeks it wouldn't wind all the way.It would go up to 6 or 7 inches and then i would have to push the rest of it in. I had it for a month and i do roofing which requires minimal measuring once you get started. I bought a Stanley Fat Max 25' tape to replace it. Its easier to read and works better. Maybe i got a bad one but if i had the choice i wouldn't buy this tape again. But thats just my opnion."
2,PAL,"item was not I was looking for, it was not in the nts format, and I did not realize it, until it was to late"
1,Had promise but did not deliver,This book sounded interesting but it really was not. The plot was mediocre. I have read many stories from the Xena fandom this writer comes from and this book is riddled with cliches that were all too familiar. Editing was poor with several glaring errors. It is a long story moreso than a novel and is printed to fill more pages than necessary.
4,Desert Debut,"Desert Hawk is a story right out of today's headlines.By creating two beautiful women destined to meet amidst the turmoil and unrest in the Middle East, Archangel in her debut novel, has written a tale of passionate adventure and daring-do.Hopefully, the stage has been set for further adventures of this modern day warrior, Daylan Hawke."
4,"A fast, unsettling journey.","The central figure of Lynch's ""Inexcusable"" is inexcusably flawed from the first page. Yet, I couldn't help turning the pages. To keep readers interested in such a despicably banal character is no small feat, and Lynch manages to walk a fine line, revealing Keir's humanity without blinking at his depravity. I can imagine fans of Anderson's ""Speak"" or Flinn's ""Breathing Underwater"" and ""Fade to Black"" appreciating this perspective on the psyche of a damaged, dangerous young man. He is, sadly, too recognizable."
4,Torey Windsor high school/VT,I think this book was fantastic! The life of a nice boy nd what drugs can do to you. I wondered throughout the whole book what happend then at the end everything connected. It was really well written.
2,Are You Kidding Me?,"This book was really annoying and predictable. It is easy to see that the author was simply trying too hard to make a point. Keir is a character that I found myself constantly becoming angry with and I do not understand how people can relate to him. The point, if there is one, is highly obscure. If you want a nauseatingly contradictory read, look no further."
2,Ehhhh...,"While I'm all for the fall of the jock, buckling under his own stupidity, this is a little outrageous. What Lynch describes, but never states, is an extremely unbalanced young man, with some sort of personality disorder and a huge case of denial. This makes him hard to relate to, while making his thoughts garbled. The plot appeared to be alluring, but the style with which is was written is just revolting. The switching between present and past tenses is confusing, not poetic. Character relationships are obscure at times. I found the entire ""that wasn't me"" attitude a little hard to take after the first few incidents.Save the money, or buy a book more worthwhile than this one."
2,Guidance is missing.,"This story is well written and the characters are believable, however there is no guidance or solutions for Keir's selfish and childish behavior. Our schools are full of students like Keir. They don't know right from wrong if someone doesn't teach it to them. They drink alcohol; take drugs; vandalize property; behave selfishly, and even perform date rape. Are we supposed to forgive them just because they feel some pressure to grow up? I think this book missed a great opportunity to teach our young men a lesson in responsibility. Unfortunately many parents can't or won't do it."
2,Disturbing novel about being above moral law,"Have you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you wouldn't feel bad? Have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him? In this story, the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he's still a ""good guy"" because ""good guys"" don't do bad things. Dizzing logic, huh? Throughout the novel, you review his senior year of high school with him. It starts out with the story of how he got the nickname ""Killer"" to why it's okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue. The flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he didn't rape her. He won't let her leave the room until she believes it. The ending is less than satisfactory for me. I would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice."
4,classic denial,"A strong story that I couldn't put down. Brilliantly planned and executed, the author starts out at the end of the story, then brings us back to it through first person narrative in journal-style. Through this, the truth slowly unfolds, even though it's colored by the main character's denials.The main character, Keir, has a strong voice that keeps the story interesting and the pages turning. I was intrigued at how Keir had done everything he considered inexcusable, denied it to himself and his loved ones, yet still made me care about what was going to happen to him. Excellent story."
3,Inexcusable by Chris Lynch,"Use caution when deciding to read 'Inexcusable'. On the whole, this book provides compelling truth about how we justify our terrible actions. But if this book is read by someone who is not ready to read about drugs, sex/rape, and partying then this book is not for them. However, this is a reality that youth today have come face to face with. At first I was appalled by all the swearing and other content in the story, but I realized that this story addresses an important issue that many people want to ignore. If you want to get this book for a young adult, I would make sure they see what an idiot the main character, Keir, is. If they don't, then you have a problem and the book didn't do any good. What I loved the most about the book is that it showed how easy it is to justify terrible actions, or trick yourself into thinking you never did them. This book teaches something that adults and teens really need to understand."
2,Disappointing,"Ths story starts out alright, but it becomes choppy and hard to understand. It keeps switching from past to present, without much warning. The ending isn't satisfying, and although the basic plot is good, it's very confusing. It's also hard to relate to the characters.It's okay, but borrow it from the library. It's not worth the money to buy it, unless you've read it first and liked it."
1,This game isn't out!,"The game isn't out, no you don't own it, you didn't win it in a contest. You are a complete tool for writing a review for a game that hasn't been released yet. Oh and by the way you cousin's friend's uncle doesn't work for the company and that didn't give you the game before it came out. you are an idiot!"
2,Why would they change the ratings to this?,"I have been waiting so long for this game to come out. But now I heard they changed the ratings to this game I mean why would they change it from rated T for Teen to M for Mature I mean they should've put this game to Mature rated in the first place if it has anything to do with Nudity, Blood and Gore, ETC. But the one thing I want to say is that the guys need to learn what to do next time alright. I don't have anymore to say."
4,classic with lots of replayability,Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. Love it and continue to play even with owning Skyrim and Borderlands 2.
1,NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS..,"I purchased one of Drews series years ago and it still is my favorite cd. ( I'm a part-time DJ)Since then, Drews series don't seem to be the original artists. If you dont mind that and your guests cant tell or dont care, its a good party cd."
4,Dean Hardshell Case for 12 string Boca guitar,"If you are looking for protection for your 12 string Boca,this is it.There always room for improvement on ruggedness."
3,Disappointed,"The product arrived on time however, I used it twice and by the third time it no longer sprayed. The glitter gets clogged in the nozzle and it doesn't come out. I wanted to use it for my wedding, but had to find something else to compromise."
3,It's okay,"From the reviews I read, I thought this dvd would be funnier that what it was. I wasn't really impressed with it."
2,National flyscreen review,National failed to mention that the back half of the bracket was painted flat black and was not chromed as was indicated. This is not a good look on chrome forks.
5,Son,"The product was not for me, but for my son. It is a very, very hard to get item.All I can say is that he loves the stuff."
5,Baseballs Best is a Complete Listing.,Baseballs Best is a complete listing of alltimeplayers teams poems and feature articles. Itwas definetly worth ordering and fun to read.A must read for baseball fans of any era.
1,It's a stole ES UNA ESTAFA DE EDICION. NO LO COMPREN,"Pésima edición , es un robo, viene mal editado y no contiene nada de lo que dicen, hasta que no me retornen el dinero no dejaran de ser estafadores y ladrones. NO LO COMPREN, QUE NO LOS ROBEN A USTEDES TAMBIEN"
4,Good Survey of Algorithms and Data Structures,"The CLR book is a good source of information about commonly used algorithms and data structures. It's not the be all end all in that regard, but for most purposes, it will probably have an efficient solution for your problem. By and large the material is presented in a clear and concise way, and their psuedocode is easily translated into whatever language you happen to be using.Note that this book is not for novices - it's fairly complex and assumes a good background both in programming and mathematics. Also, while the text makes a very good reference, it is also a text book, so it does pose some questions that it doesn't answer completely, or at all. It's quite a task to read through this book cover to cover, but doing so is well worth the effort."
2,review,I hate this book! It is sooo hard to understand it. Even the simple concepts are described so bad that i hate opening it. I wish there was another book with simple words and easy explanation of concepts.
2,Not advanced enough,"This book doesn't cower enough, and is full of bull. They should have made it 800 pages shorter, and covered more advanced algorithms. (since I'm only a second year CS student I can't imagen this book beeing of practical use for advanced users )"
3,"Extensive, but some problems","CLR's Introduction to Algorithms is, for the most part,excellent. The primary annoyance is that the text is now at least inits nineteenth printing, and they have not incorporated the 27 pages of errata (i.e., typos and bugs) found since the second printing."
1,A student's perspective -- this book is horrible,"I don't know who is paying the other critics to give this book a high rating but this book has a lot of problems. There is an insufficient number of sample problems with answers, which is a minimum requirement for any math book. The questions at the end of each chapter are not related to the examples described within the chapters. It can take hours to frame a problem and even then you are not sure if your answers are correct because you have no way to check your work. ""We will leave that as an excersise for the student"" -- what a cop out.The sad part is that the material should not be impossible to learn. The authors have managed to take a difficult subject and make it worse. You know you are in trouble when your professor is also struggling with the material in the book. Whatever happened to ""reaching the students""."
4,complete but lack of examples,This book is by far the most complete one I have ever seen. It covers wide variety of algorithms and data stuctures used in computer science field. Only drawback is that it does not have lots of examples.
5,Beverly Ann...La Energia y Sabor Del Merengue,"Beverly Ann en su primera produccion ""Estoy Aqui"" nos presenta un disco lleno de sabor, energia, y su talento. Esta produccion dirigida por Raldy Vazquez para el sello FonoVisa Tropical es un verdadero exito. Temas como: ""Mi Negrito Lindo"", ""Estoy Aqui"", y ""Te Moririas"" te haran bailar hasta solo. Definitivamente el disco ""Estoy Aqui"" de Beverly Ann, un gran exito. A otros admiradores de Beverly Ann me gustaria que me escribieran a mi e-mail: merensalsa@hotmail.com"
1,Oversung,"The CD is actually by Marc Heller, an operatic tenor, accompanied by Alfred Heller on piano. The singer ruins most of the varied material by feeling it necessary to swell and show off his volume during every song. He seems incapable of subtlety or reading a lyric. Virtually all the material is spoilt by this vulgar display and unfeeling delivery."
4,Disappointed about one thing!,"I invite you to watch this podcast on Youtube (watch?v=3H1gzVj8i4o) called Diamond Dust, which is a promotional for ""Christmas in Yellowstone"". Absolutely beautiful, isn't it? With wonderful music, but of course the low-resolution video is terribly grainy. I bought this DVD expecting to see and hear it the way the podcast is supposed to be, with hopefully more of the same.Guess what? It's not part of the actual program! Not there at all! What's up with that? I bought ""Christmas in Yellowstone"", expecting to see and hear more of what is in the podcast promoting ""Christmas in Yellowstone"", and it's not there! Am I being too picky in expecting to find the same footage and music?I'm not discouraging anyone from buying this program, it's wonderful, it's beautiful, but I am expressing my disappointment to the producers over this omission."
4,Interesting Analysis,"This was a great read for me. I'm a very big fan of James Morrow and was delighted with this collection. There is some very thought-provoking stuff in his work and the essays clearly illustrate that. If you're a fan of Morrow, I suggest this book for it's fantastic analysis of his wonderful satire.Update: I don't remember reading the book or writing the review, so while I agree with how wonderful James Morrow is, I'm going to have to reread it to make sure I wasn't just hallucinating."
3,just OK,"Instruction is very basic. The music with the instruction DVD isn't the actual song that goes with the dances, just instrumental. Although there is a second CD that has the actual songs on it. I had more fun following along with the song on the CD as the singer called out the moves. Would be better if it were all on one."
3,a one-act play concerning a practical joke,"This one-act play was first performed in London, 1899 at the St. James Theatre. It was revived in 1902 where it ran over 100 performances.Six gentlemen are spending the night at a hotel in a small country town. At the beginning of the play, the men have just heard a story about a supposed ghost inhabiting the hotel. One of the travelers loves theatricals, and when a few of the others are out of the room, he wagers that he can scare someone if he dresses up as the ghost.The stage directions are quite thorough. You know exactly where each actor is move, sit and stand, and what he is to do. There are two endings to the play, in case ""the above tragic termination would be too serious.""- posted by Poore Richard's wyfe"
2,Be careful which book you buy!,"PLEASE NOTE: The following review is for ""Math Formulas and Tables: Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics. Tables of Integrals, Identities, Transforms & more. FREE Derivatives in demo (Mobi Study Guides)."" Amazon is erroneously cross-posting reviews to the Schaum's Outline book, which is unfortunate, because the Schaum's book is excellent.MobileReference has awkwardly stitched this book together from Wikipedia content, but it costs nearly the same amount ($10) as the Kindle edition of the Schaum's outline. For the money, I find the Schaum's to be more comprehensive and easier to read."
3,Not as much help as it should be,"I bought this book as an aid to EM theory and Quantum Mechanics. I found little really useful stuff. The series expansion didn't have (1+u)^-3/2 for example, or the curl operator in cylindrical and spherical coordinates. The integral table is limited. The authors should look at books like Dwight, for example, and make sure their coverage is more complete. I am disapointed in it. For the money, it should be much better."
4,Great Formula Book,This book contains useful information such as the different integral types and other useful math formulas found in calculus. If you are just taking calculus then I would recommend purchasing this book and then learning how to reference to it for the formulas you need.
4,"Great Arrangements, Great Selection","I recommend this CD to anyone who likes interesting arrangements of Christmas music - it is piano only. I appreciate the pianist's talent, song choice and arrangements. This album is now on my list of Christmas albums to give to other family members - it is really that special. The only drawback is that perhaps the piano used in the recording could have been better quality. I'm not sure if the sound was intentional or a result of not being able to record at a better level."
2,"Cute watch, great service.","Great sellor. The watch came quickly as promised, and the communication with the seller was excellent. The watch was great for the price, cute but nothing fancy."
2,Did not use it!,"I returned this item because I needed to buy a adapter, which cost $35.00, in order to use it."
3,Decent,"This is a decent book which encourages experimentation with dehydrating your food and creating recipes- something often left out of both dehydrating and backpacking food books. However, for what everything it does have or encourage, it lacks detail and I felt like there could have been so much more. As it is, it is worth the purchase in conjuction with at least one more, far substantial book."
3,Good start,"This is a good base for learning how to dehydrate and then how to make a meal out of it. The section I found most useful is the part that lists the drying times, carbohydrates and protein for each individual food. I do a lot of backpacking so the carb and protein intake is VERY important. I was disappointed on the number of recipes, or I should say the lack there of. But aside from that, not bad. I'm sure there are more comprehensive books out there."
4,Preparing for the Trail,have you every wanted to make food or dry it like these freeze-dri packs that you buy and are priced to high? Whell this book is for you. Now you can find out how to prepare food for them lond or weekend hikes. This book has information on drying time and what temp. to what to look for when the food is done drying. I have been looking for a book like this and it has helped me in preparing for my trips.
4,Met expectations,Covers the basics of dehydrating foods. A Fast read. Would've liked to see a more extensive listing of food suggestions. Good quick reference.
2,Newer/better trail food books out there,"I am in charge of packing the food for my sister and I each Spring and Fall for ten days in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. I started drying our own food after the first trip (up to 15 now).I bought this book because I like Alan S. Kesselhelm as a writer. While Kesselhelm has in-depth wilderness experience, I fear I was spoiled by owning Teresa Marrone's ""The Back-Country Kitchen"" first. Good basics, of course, but my fav parts were the illustrations by Marypat Zitzer and the short introductory essays about life in the wilderness."
2,Not sure I trust it.,The book was short on usable recipes. But my main concern was the advocacy of drying eggs. I suppose it can be done but everything I have seen on drying eggs has said that it was a dangerous thing to do. The book was a disappointment to me.
2,Lot's of potential! Just not on this CD!,"I wanted to hear what was the big deal was about the artist Live365.com was showcasing. At first listen, Jennifer Lang has a voice that reminds me of Anita Baker and Rachelle Ferrell, very soulful and sensual. However, upon further review, I found the selection of songs on this CD to be a let down and didn't give her vocals justice. The songs would have been better suited for a Hip-Hop artist in the Lauren Hill mode. Overall, I see lots of potential with this singer in the future. With the right producer and better song selection, she'll go places."
1,Warm to the touch.,I work for a utility company and I work out in the field. So I spend about $250 a month on lunch usually fast food or at a diner depending on the area I am at. Then I came across this grill. I thought wow I could to save some money using this grill. Got the grill followed the instruction and the hot plates were only warm to the touch. I did not even try to cook with it because it was just not hot enough.
2,Don't bother.,"Apparently this product hasn't gotten any better in the three years since the previous gentleman review it. I purchased this for my fiance who is a truck driver. I was hoping this would provide him a way of cooking meat/grilling sandwiches, but it only gets hot enough to melt the butter on the bread. Obviously, it wouldn't get hot enough to cook a piece of raw meat. It's being returned. Very disappointed."
4,A Latin Jazz legend still going strong,"This disc starts off with a bang, with swift salsa tunes like ""La Voz Del Caribe"" and ""Grandpa Semi-Tone Blues"" showing that Palmieri's still got the fire in the belly, and a band that can match his passion. He moves steadily into a jazzier, smoother mode, but it's all top-flight material. Even after all these decades into his career, Palmieri still seems like a force of nature: nothing can slow him down or make a dent in his soulfulness and love of the music. If you're a fan of modern Latin Jazz or salsa, then this is an album you'll appreciate."
3,A Solid Effort!,"People need creativity, fantasy, passion and caring, argues Alan Briskin, and when they're deprived of those things at work, there's trouble ahead. Briskin's book works well as a study in modern-day alienation. Tracing the loss of soul at work to scientific engineering, he summarizes various research findings that will seem like old college friends to those with business degrees. But the book sags when it sets forth into the land of the soul, where Briskin gets fuzzy, unfocused, repetitious and just plain hard to understand. In addition, he never actually gets around to telling us how to get soul back at work. Nevertheless, we [...] recommend this book to managers, employees and students with a desire to look deeper into the balance of hard work and personal satisfaction, and the patience to wade through the sometimes trite."
3,Deceptive Cover,"The actual content of the book is great. Very funny. However, if you buy the soft cover version, it loses a lot of visual appeal. Instead of the book still being red and a rectangle, as it is pictured, it is actually just a PICTURE of that red book on a square white book. Major disappointment."
4,"Great stuff, though, well, limited","My teenager showed me this spoof. Reading random segments of Bobby Henderson's book (and everything about it IS indeed random) causes shaking of the head, occasional whoops of laughter, and spontaneous eruptions of ""oh, my!"" and ""tsk, tsk!""It is definitely an appropriate comedic answer to the ridiculous state of affairs in modern US public education, where non-scientific points of view are being forced into the schools along with the fact-based content. (Superstitions and religious beliefs can easily coexist without having to be TAUGHT!) That said, the humor IS decidedly adolescent in flavor, and also decidedly shows little respect for real and honorable religious belief. For all its irreverence, however, it is occasionally very clever, and highly amusing."
3,Get out the grog!,"Bobby Henderson, The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (Villard, 2006)Can I get a Ra-men? The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is here, and pirates the world over rejoice. If you're familiar with the noodly one, you've probably got a good idea of what to expect here-- it's offensive, it's lowbrow, it's amusing, in some vague, distressing sense of the word. It is, overall, a parody of the Intelligent design movement, and as such, it is filled with pseudointellectual parodies of scientific papers aping those written by proponents of ID. In this vein, the book is too much of a good thing; half the pseudoscience and twice the offensiveness would have worked better, I think. But then, as a dedicated pastafarian, I'm much more interested in slurping up a big plate of spaghetti than wondering how we all got here. ***"
3,"Great book, shoddy construction.","Bobby Henderson has produced a humorous, thought-provoking, and enjoyable read for people of all backgrounds and belief systems. However, the construction of this book is horrendous. Simply put, I'm pretty sure that it was printed and bound by a company that generally dedicates itself to the production of coloring books. The cover is thin and will no doubt bend and fall off in time (I've used clear packing tape to reinforce mine), and the pages are cheap, thin, and pulpy. I like to own books because I know they will be around for a long time for myself and others to enjoy. This one may not make it past a few reads."
5,Teaching the Controversy,"This book, with it's thorough satire of Intelligent Design, should be read by any person who desires to discuss science, naturalism, supernaturalism, and/or creationism. Parts of it read very much like Creationist (excuse me, Intelligent Design) arguments, down to the logical and factual errors. Just bear in mind that this is satire, and you, Dear Reader, should come away suitably enlightened.""Q: Your ""religion"" offends my (probably Christian) beliefs.A: That's not a question.""May you be ever blessed by the Spaghedeity. RAmen."
5,Fighting blind faith with blind silliness (or cynicism),"It is not the funniest romp available and reads a little like a thinly stretched out good premise. However, in these shallow days with little disposition for debate, cynicism is often the only appropriate rhetoric tool. So, if you're tired of trying to explain why you're an atheist, buy the FSM Gospel and charge your opponent as a Atheist himself!"
5,Very funny,"Very funny - lots of great explanations of gravity, etc. Definitely more than you have otherwise read, all from the Prophet's pen!"
2,Look Closely,"Although the material is ok, I was disappointed by the package. I did not look close enough to recognize that it is a picture of the the gospel printed on a white colored softcover book. I was instantly disappointed."
2,I dont understand the popularity of this book.,I did finish reading it since its a fast book to read. But I personally dont understand the popularity of this book. Heaven and hell were not explained at all. It was sorta funny but not HAHAHA funny. Maybe I just dont have as good of a sense of humor as most people?
1,Very Poorly put together,"Like most everyone who wrote a negative review, I too thought that this book would be something that it was not, original, creative and something like a ""gospel"" filled with prayers, history and stories about the FSM and Pastafarianism and all it's wonderful pirates and midgets and strippers. This was not the case!It is however, a series of poorly writen and poorly organized articles making the same repetitive assertions we've been reading since the ""Open Letter"" was writen.This book will only make money for Bobby Henderson (Nice letter to the school board Bobby, but what have you done since?) and a publishing company the same way publishers and churches make money off selling christian bibles. Worse still, and most of all, is that this book won't allow bible-thumpers to laugh at the joke or get the point that the FSM was invented to get accross in the first place."
2,"A lot of gratuitous swearing, not all that funny","I picked up this book thinking something as subversive and whimsical as the Flying Spaghetti Monster would yield a lighthearted skewering of religious absurdities. It tries in its way, but its style includes a lot of unnecessary f-bombs and sophomoric writing. It's like a frat boy's version of religious insurgency -- not all that bright, boisterous and awkward, and slightly embarrassing."
4,"Pastafari, unite!","This is a must have, if you're a fan of the FSM. Well written and fun. The author deserves a few sheckles for what he created. His campaign helped get the Kansas State Board of Education to rescind their decision to teach Intelligent Design along with Science in all their public schools. Hey, if you want to believe in ID, be my guest. VooDoo is also a belief, but I don't think it should get equal time, either."
3,Disappointing,"I can't help it -- I was VERY disappointed when I received this book. From the picture shown on Amazon, it appeared that this book had a red leatherette cover with a gold ribbon bookmark just like more traditional gospels. That's not the case. This paperback book (with rather cheap greyish pages) has a white cover with a PICTURE of the red book with a gold ribbon bookmark on it.Content: 5 stars. False advertising: 1 star. Avg: 3 stars."
1,"Good satire, awful presentation","I had read all about FSM before picking up this book and bought it as more of a conversation piece.Well, suffice to say this will never get any space with my other books as it is very poorly put together.Flimsy cover, flimsy pages, it's put together about as well as a children's coloring book.I too was fooled by the default picture, I thought it was a nice hard cover with a bookmark ribbon like other ""religious"" texts.Nothing could be further from the truth.Hey Amazon, change the default picture to the one which shows the book as is, a flimsy cover with a picture of a hard cover on it."
3,Okay for light reading,"I only recently heard about the Flying Spaghetti Monster and I had a very good laugh. After browsing the web, I decided to purchase this book. The first 30-40 pages are quite funny and I found myself laughing out loud a few times. However, shortly after that, it starts going downhill. It was simply not funny anymore - I recognized the places I was supposed to laugh but it was just shallow. After page 100 it just started to become plain boring and I decided not to read the last 15-20 pages (and I'm usually the type of person that even finishes a boring movie/book just for the sake of finishing it). Overall, I wouldn't recommend."
2,Plaaaaaaaaaaaaayed out,Old meme driven into the ground by every token 3dgey IM AN ATHEIST DEAL WITH IT nerd on the internet.
1,The book has the quality of Spaghettios,The idea of a religious spoof intrigued me. The book itself was unreadable. Totally assinine. Waste of money.
1,cheap,"cheap book, cheap teenager humour. The letter to the school board was funny but then that guy takes himself way too seriously."
3,Lite reading,"A light, but frivolous, entertainment. While it is humorous in spots, it isn't as funny as the author thinks it is. I appreciate the attempt to question the basic tenants of established religion but the book could have accomplished the same thing in a lot fewer pages. No need to say the same thing over and over again but worded differently. But then it wouldn't have been a book."
4,Good Read,"I haven't read the entire book yet, but it's pretty funny so far. Even if you could just show it off to all your friends it would be worth it. I say go for it, it's worth the buy."
2,Basically one joke stretched to fill (sell) a book,"I am not hostile to the message,but if you flip through this book for five minutes, you've gotten the point."
5,"""Perfect....""","I am an old soul dwelling in the body of a 15 y/o student of philosophy & religion. Recently, I was given ""The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"" by She Who Birthed Me, and for that I am grateful. So many of the REALLY BIG QUESTIONS OF LIFE are now answered! The book is an enigma within a conundrum wrapped in a riddle, but solvable. Trust me, after reading this, IT WILL ALL BECOME CLEAR! Faithfully, SuperSquid"
5,The Flying Spaghetti Monster RULES!,"After reading His Noodly Word, I have been inspired to become a missionary and spread His Sauce among the non-believers.With regard to the quality of the book, see ""I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts"" #6. The FSM certainly wouldn't want a lot of money spent on his gospel. In this form, His Word can reach the multitudes.RAMEN"
3,"Concept good, execution needs work","While this is a somewhat witty must-read for FSM members, the humor is sometimes cheap, like gratuitous uses of the f-bomb. It seemed like the book was written in a hurry."
1,BASED ON QUALITY ALONE!,"Alright, this has nothing to do with the content of the book itself. I'll keep this short and brief. If you really want to read this book, like myself you'll buy it, but the quality is absolute garbage. The production quality of this book is literally like a dollar store coloring book, so I'm severely disappointed. It's super flimsy, I was expecting a nice little sized book but it's also like the size of a notebook. I swear it's like printed on a coloring book. Just be warned, you're going to be getting a very poorly made book, but I have hope the content will make me die laughing."
5,Deep Adherence to Intelligent Principles,"As a Christian with a strong belief in the value of Intelligent Design principles, I was horrified to hear of this book. It seemed to be a mockery of all that we righteous stand for. Despite this, I think it's very important to know thy enemies, and so I read a copy fo this book as soon as I was able.Let me tell you, this book really is on to something. I think the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a true divine being, and we are not doing enough to teach it's gospel. I think it's entirely possible, having read this book, that we Christians have so much to learn and incorporate about the FSM. I am going to fight to get this book into our schools and our classes. And I have started a letter writing campaign to Judges Roberts and Alito to try to get them to see the value in praising the FSM in the Pledge of Allegiance.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I have. Really.Ramen."
5,Wow... Great read,True enlightenment. What makes this book so special? It has indeed been touched by his holy appendage.
5,"Arghhh, Me Maties!","Pirates being the chosen of the Spaghetti Monster.Recommended by a friend who's probably as twisted as I am.Very entertaining book! As you read it you actually begin to see the author's logic.Just plain fun!I did not like how the book ended, but I so thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it that I gave it 5 stars.And by the way..... I'm NOT an athiest.xoxMEF"
4,Simply delightful,"I was delighted to read The Gospel and will now say Ramen! As an avowed atheist The Gospel appeals to my sense of the ridiculous towards all religions. I find worship of spaghetti as realistic and believable as the worship of any diety. The reasons for believing in the FSM are, for me, credible and - dare I say - I could be converted to such a whimsical religion in the knowledge that no one will blow me up with meatballs covered in pasta sauce if I stray from the fold."
5,Funny as heck,"If you're a normal, intelligent person, you'll love the humor of this book.I'm not very well versed on Pastafarianism myself, but I think it's only purpose is to show the ridiculousness of organized religion and the fact that some people will believe anything. The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster accomplishes this in a very entertaining, enjoyable, and satirical fashion that anyone will enjoy.If you're an atheist (like me), an agnostic, or are just looking for a nice, hardy laugh, this book is for you!"
2,So much potential,"I'll start off by saying I loved the Open Letter and the concept of the FSM. But I was disappointed by this gospel.Besides the shoddy publishing, it pains me to say that I did not enjoy reading this book. Where the Open Letter is hilarious and brilliantly satrical, this book resorts to simple vulgarity to fill its pages. It does present several witty and laughable arguments only to reduce them to mindless ranting littered with gratuitous swearing and vulgarity. I had great expectations for this gospel but am left disappointed.I recommend supporting FSM-ism. But if you buy this gospel, expect the great concepts to be wrapped in dirty, cheap, and juvenile humor."
2,Pastafarians Unite!,"I consider myself to be a true pastafarian, but my advice is to skip the book as it contains no redeeming value.May all who walk in the truth be touched by his noodly appendage.I bought the book to help Bobby, and you can do the same, but the website is infinitely more entertaining.Arrrr. May ye hang from the yardarm if ye don't convert now!Thanks everyone (including you Pirates), Steve Willie, Olympia, WA"
3,"Problems with the Kindle Edition, hard back may be better","A caution about the Kindle version, specifically: The Kindle version lacks the visual ques (such as shaded text and the like) that apparently are used in the paper version to let the reader know whether the author is speaking or some person with an alternate view is speaking. As for the book, it is best when espousing the gospel (entertaining, religiously plausible of course, and if you don't feel like dressing as a pirate after reading it, you must be suffering from a crisis of faith) and worst when it is presenting direct arguments against ""intelligent design"" simply because there are other writers who do a better job of that part."
5,Great Book! But False Advertisement,"Like others, I was duped with the false advertising of the quality of the book.The book itself was great, funny and satirical."
5,glad I made this purchase,"I have loosely followed the FSM concept (mostly through word of mouth as my boyfriend and his step brother said ""YAR"" and wore pirate hats explaining to me about global warming) ... and I got a kick out of the gospel. I have ordered extras as gifts for the boyfriend and step brother."
5,I have been touched,Finally! I have something to show those who tell me Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is not a real religion because it doesn't have its own book.No the quality is not great but I have a feeling this went through a vanity press. SAve it though - future bindings may be fancier but this is the original!
5,Work of Genius!,"Changed my life. And I mean it as an improvement.Spectacular view of our existence, but not for most people."
4,FSM gospel,I recently bought this copy of the gospel of the flying spaghetti monster as a gag gift for a friend. Aside form there being a very slight bend in the cover (possibly from the mail) it was a fairly good condition.
3,"Great Text, Poor Atlas","This book was one of two required for a graduate course in Histology. If you must take a Histology course in graduate school or medical school, I would recommend purchasing a separtate atlas, especially if you are a novice or have limited availability to quality slides. I personally recommend diFiore because it has multiple atlas plates for each tissue with different magnifications and stains. It is also reasonably priced. The text in Ross is very well written and presents the material in a compact, to the point style. This allows the student to learn the material without searching for what is and is not important."
5,A great book,"This book was suggested to me by my University as part of the Histology curriculum of the General Med. program. It took me quite a while to understand that this is probably the best histology book there is, and I have 3 other books to prove it..Some may find it diffucult to digest at the beginning, the middle and the end, like I had, but now I understand that Histology as a subject is hard and nothing more.For a medical student there are other books out there, may be more consice and with more graphics, but if you want to excell in your Histo class, this is the book. Ross doesnt neglect anything! I found the illustrations sufficient and accompanied by short summaries of what was already mentioned and not mentioned in the text. They were exellent as a review of the material.For those who find the graphics insufficient I would suggest buying an Atlas."
5,Excellent book for my medical histology class,I found this book very helpful and packed with good info on histology. This book is quite thorough and is essential for any medical student taking a class in histology. The pictures are quite helpful because it was easier to identify simple epithelia verses squamous epithelia as one example. If you want a great study guide for the type of questions teachers ask get the following: Histology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers (ISBN; 0971999686)The last book helped me to focus on the type of questions asked on my exams. I was recommended this book from a few friends who have already taken the class. They said it helped them get good grades. I guess they were right. With the help of these two books I did wonderfully.
1,Confusing,The timeline throughout the story was confusing. It seemed like the author wrote the story lines for the different characters at different times and did not sync the timing for the overall story when meshing the story lines.
2,In need of editing,"Chronicles of the Planeswalkers was an editorial mess. Commas were overused, but they were only added in the WRONG places! There are continuity issues, and I stumbled upon so many grammatical errors that I was unable to get into the book.Why 2, rather than 1, stars? Because the physical quality of the book is good, and the artwork is stunning. The storyline is also above-average, but the grammar is so bad that one can't get into the book."
1,Disappointing,"Mr Nordmark's book has inspired me to not use pre-cast concrete blocks for our landscape terracing. In fact, the book is so non-inspirational that I went back to check the product description. And yes, these are Mr Nordmark's designs, and yes, it does provide ideas any gardener could use. But you wouldn't want to. Mr Nordmark's designs, for the most part, are heavy-handed: the proportion of hardscape to landscape is disproportionate, and made worse by an over-reliance on rock, pebble or stone mulch. There is so much curvature, it would appear he has an aversion for the straight line. But what is unforgivable in a designer is he does not appear to understand balancing elements or design ratios, as in the right ratio of height to width to depth. I don't doubt all those gardens represent an enormous amount of hard work by Mr Nordmark, but, even so, these are not designs worth copying (or publishing)."
3,Terracing with landscape blocks,It is a good book for people who want to landscape with the landscape blocks but for just terracing it was disappointing. Lots of good pictures and step by step instructions.
2,A singular vision,"Mr. Nordmark likes the precast concrete block you can get at your local home store. He also likes the kind of design you see on the cover and sticks to his theme throughout. If you think you might like to see a variety of materials and layouts, you should get another book. I see lots of good reviews here, but found the designs to all look very similar, and the materials to be, well, concrete block. Also, the photos, while plentiful, are washed out, sometimes blurry, and more dated-looking than the 2001 publishing date would suggest."
2,"This is ""just an OK"" book","This book is small and ""just ok"" for do-it-yourselfers. The book has lots of photos that pretty much all look the same. Two pages contain a list of tools needed and a photo of the three types of landscape blocks used, then you are on your own. Basically with some landscape blocks, some concrete adhesive, and a level, you can do it without this book. I gleaned the book in about a half-hour. Once you have read those two pages on what to use, you won't be needing this book."
1,"Offers Little, Inspiration or Value for Your Money","This book offers little! From the momment you open the cover you become aware that it is poorly done. The photos are of such poor quality that most could do better with a digital camera and a photo printer. Content wise it is merely a repitition of the same style of block design throughout the book. It is not that I am anti-block, rather I felt let-down by some of the other reviews. Don't waste your money as I did, look else where."
5,Simply wonderful,"This book along with Paul's work are perfect examples of God's work through man. Paul takes a simple piece of material, a brick. He developes a beautiful work of art with brick and God's land. He is able to vision a work of art before he begins to dig the first load. The book depicks the many designs that can be accomplished by inspiration and faith. Every design is unique.Gary StinsonMoreno Valley Ca."
1,Stop! Save your money!,"This book was a big disappointment, especially for the price tag. The photo quality was poor and the designs not at all inspiring. This is the first book we have ever returned. Don't waste your money on this book. Try the Sunset Hillside Landscaping book if you're looking for creative terracing ideas (the pictures are small but the ideas are worthwhile)."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed to find that the entire book talks about walls made from fake wall stone that looks nothing like the real thing (think of those homogeneous cast concrete blobs at your local home store). In my opinion, which is obviously contrary to the author's, he is doing a great disservice to the natural beauty of any landscape, by pushing more people to fill their suburbs with fake walls. My advice: forget the book and hire a good stone mason."
1,not inspirational,"I wish I had know there was a web site for this guy, it would have saved me the cost of the book. Before you buy check out sructurelandscaping.com - it will give you an idea of what his style is. I would call it lumberyard/hardware store display style."
1,What a disappointment,"The book should have been titled ""Satisfactory Terracing With Cement Blocks From Home Depot."" Most of the information is available where the materials are purchased. The photographs are quite similar to one another. I feel duped."
1,Inspirational Terracing,I WOULD LOVE TO REVIEW THIS BOOK IF YOU EVER SEND IT TO ME!! YOU SOLICITED ME FOR THIS BOOK AND THEN COULD NOT PROVIDE IT....I AM STILL WAITING!!!AS OF TODAY IT HAS BEEN 1 MONTH SINCE I ORDERED THIS BOOK!
4,FUN DISCO AT IT'S BEST!!!,"I was recentley given this CD as a gift and though it might not be the original artists, you can't really tell. Once you start listening to the great selection of disco classics all you'll want to do is get up and dance!!! If your into disco and want some fun songs, I highly recommend this CD."
5,"Best ever, now she got it","Claire finally got it in this one. As one of her frequent readers I really enjoyed the latest of her novels. Here she combined action with character and love interest. The love interest should be still more developed since it came too late in this novel (last page), but at least Claire McNab has touched that topic in her latest novel and did not leave it out like in all the Carol Ashton or Denise Cleever novels. Way to go Claire, that looks like a good mix. Continue!"
3,Chinese Missile History 101,"I have read Iris's famous the Rape of Nanjing, and I found this book, much more compelling. Thread of the silkworm is simple and beautifully written. It examines the life of the now infamous yet brilliant rocket scientist Tsien Hsue-shen, and the political factors that would ironically lead to his deportation. It has none of the strong emotion found in the Rape of najing, and for this story I can't help but think that is a good thing."
3,Fascinating Book.,"Fascinating book about father of Chinese rocket program. Uneven in terms of storytelling. First half, anecdote. Second half, news report."
3,our country dropped the ball,"I bought this book many years ago before Wen Ho Lee and James Yee and even though I found it difficult to read, I kept it as a reminder that being of Chinese origin adversely affects your comfort level and safety in this country. This book was very hard to read because the writing style was not the best for my style of reading so I didn't get her Nanking book which I know was also criticized for the writing style. If you didn't like the Nanking book, buy this book anyway because unlike the Nanking book, there aren't a lot of books about him out there and it's about a Chinese man who was not confused about what was happening. Regardless of whether he was right or wrong, smart or stupid, he was himself undiluted. I use the past tense but he's still alive though bedridden. He was on Chinese tv when China sent their first man into space. He watched a video of it and smiled."
1,US mistake and Chinese threat,This is an interesting book that tries to describe the folly of the communist-hunting hysteria that swept through the US during the '50s. The deportation of Tsien Hsue-shen is an obvious error on the part of the US government.However Chang curiously fails to emphasize the other aspect of this sorry saga; that Tsien Hsue-shen became part of the military machine of a communist dictatorship in China and aided in the development of weapons of mass destruction that now threaten the US and the rest of the world. The author's moral stance becomes suddenly blurred here.
1,barely scratches the surface,"... the subject matter is very intriging and deservesattention. However, Ms. Chang's book has no real insight into Tsien'slife.... The actual writting is also lackingg. The book is filled with dragging sentences that fails to excite the reader. I only recommand this book to readers who do not know anything about Chinese history or Tisen. It is to be used as an general and elementry reference only. Even then, there are still many holes...."
5,70's progressive rockers are back!!!!,"Excellent concert DVD!!!! Great sound, camera work, and incredible stage lighting effects. This concert is much better than their 2002 live in New Jersey reunion DVD. The 2 new members of the band do a great job of reproducing the classic masterpieces the band is known for. ""Remember The Future part 1 & 2"" and ""A Day In The Life Of A Preacher"" are the highlights of the show. The packaging and amazing artwork on the cover blew me away when I first time I layed eyes on it. Nektar fans must get this DVD!!!!Michael A. Alcini-Las Vegas"
3,Playing Is Fine; Vocals Are Not,"Roye Albrighton struggles to sing the high notes on Nektar's early stuff (""Remember the Future"" in particular), and the result is something like watching a recent Tull show where Ian Anderson has similar trouble. It's not their fault, as we're all growing older--but I would be remiss to ignore it here.However--instrumentally, like Tull, Nektar still shines.ASJ"
3,Mediocre Performance,"I happen to think that the studio versions of their music are brilliant. 'Remember the Future' and ""Recycled"" are masterpieces in my opinion and I have loved them since the 70's. I was excited about getting this concert DVD but was quite disappointed when I watched it.I found the performance seriously lacking. Maybe it's because the band member are all much older than when they first recorded this wonderful music... Anyway, I found it so bad that I may not ever watch it again. I'll just stick with listening to the studio albums.Unfortunately, I really can't recommend this to anyone except for a really big fan ready to hear whatever they produce."
4,"Microsoft replaced my ""jumpy"" mouse, and the second one works fine","I purchased the Microsoft Basic Optical Mouse about 2 years ago. My first one had the ""jumpy cursor"" problem that others have described.Microsoft has a great replacement policy for their mice and keyboards -- just call 1-800-360-7561 and give them the product ID number (it's on the bottom of your mouse). They may ask you to fax a copy of the PID to them. They'll mail you a replacement within a a few days.I've had the replacement mouse for well over a year, and haven't had problems with it."
2,buggy,"it works, but it doesn't work flawlessly. just like most of the other reviews say, this mouse makes for a jumpy cursor. one second your in the middle of the screen, the next your in the upper left corner. it's only once in a while, but still annoying. go for a logitech instead."
1,Garbage -- 0 stars,"I have been employed as a software engineer for the past 20 years. I don't care if this thing IS advertised as a ""basic mouse"". A mouse ('basic', optical, USB, whatever) should have solid hardware and a device driver that isn't losing track of its position on the screen. Avoid this piece of junk."
2,lost pointer to many times,its an okay mouse... most of the time the pointer get lost on the screen Have to move it around on your hand to try to find it and it gets so annoying. I try to find a new driver nobody solved the problem.
1,I failed to read these reviews before I bought,"It's a piece of junk. The optical tracking does not work well, so the mouse jumps around the screen at random, which is about the most frustrating thing possible in a mouse. Don't waste your time trying differetn surfaces; it isn't the surface, it's the mouse. Don't waste your time trying to find better drivers; it isn't the drivers, it's the hardware. Microsoft used to have extremely good mice; however I've just bought two in a row that were junk. The Intellimouse Explorer's left mouse button stopped working in a week, and this Basic Optical mouse jumps around. I can only conclude that someone at Microsoft has started cutting costs. It's a shame, because they're ruining a really good reputation. Buy Logitech instead."
1,Basic Optical Mouse is basically bad,"I'm using this with a PS2 adapter, plugged into a new machine running Windows XP Home. The mouse pointer behaves erratically at times, probably 3 or 4 times an hour at least, jumping to extreme corners of the screen. Sometimes I lose it for seconds, trying to find out where it went to.I have tried different mouse pads to no avail. I also tried uninstalling & reinstalling the default XP mouse driver that it uses. I bought 2 of these due to their low cost & my past preference for the feel of Microsoft mice, and both have the same problem. Unfortunately, this product's a piece of junk. I went back to the ball mouse that came with my computer, and will now hunt for a different non-Microsoft optical mouse.Pros: Cheap (cost)Cons: Cheap (quality)"
1,Also found it buggy,"Don't waste your time with this mouse!I purchased this mouse and found (like most people) that the cursor randomly jumped around the screen. It did this on both my PC and my Mac. So I exchanged it for another one, same thing. Seems like this model is just consistently buggy. Save yourself some time and don't buy this mouse."
1,Jumpier than a Chihuahua with a sleep disorder!,"I have loaded the appropriate drivers onto my machine, and have checked on the NET for a solution, but the cursor jumps around for absolutely no reason. This cursor might be a good choice if you are bored and want things to occur completely at random to spice up your life or something (round and round she goes, where she stops nobody knows,) but for anyone wanting to do any serious work, you will be frustrated beyond belief.If you are a graphic artist or do desktop publishing, use the plastic packaging to slit your wrists - it will be a much more peaceful end than the aneurysm that you will surely experience after using this horrible product for an hour or so."
2,Jumpy,"The mouse pointer jumped one to three times daily for me. I tried using the mouse on another computer, reinstalling it, updating the drivers, switching USB ports, and even using a blank piece of paper as a mouse pad with no success. I had no problems with its compact shape but a jumpy pointer is too frustrating to deal with and I had to get another mouse."
2,Where is the mouse,"sure its an okay mouse... when it works, every once and a while it gets lost on the screan and is imposible to find, you have to move it around on your hand to try to find it and it gets so anoying. I recomend almost anything instead of this mouse"
1,Basically Broken,"Bought the Basic Optical Mouse from Office Depot about 1/2 year ago. After a month or so the mouse quit working altogether upon XP startup. I unplugged it from the USB port and then re-plugged it in.Worked like a charm.But after many unplug and re-plugs later I have tired of this mouse.Finally, about 2 weeks ago, the right click quit working.Unplug/replug didn't fix this problem.Looks like there is a 3 year warranty and I did save the packaging.Maybe I'll get lucky."
1,Don't buy this!,"This isn't basic, it isn't functional - it's a piece of junk. I talked to customer service, they finally said, ""take it back to the store"". Look at all the reviews that say this thing skips all over your screen and believe them."
1,This mouse is a piece of dung,Where should one start? 1) very cheaply made; 2) mouse jumps around eratically even when you barely move it; 3) Wheel is extremely jittery; 4) Wheel is also very erratic (you end up having to use keyboard if you need to move around from page to page more than a little). All in all a real piece of dung. Avoid at all costs. Even for $10.00 a poor purchase.
1,Worst mouse I've ever used: bug ridden rubbish,"My older optical mouse gave way, and I replaced with this one. It appeared similar, but while my older mouse worked reliably, this one is a buggy, useless piece of trash.Every now and then it will suddenly bug out and the pointer jumps around. This is extremely annoying when working, but it makes playing games impossible. While playing a first-person shooter, for example, the mouse will work fine for a while, then suddenly jump, and you'll be looking at the ceiling, literally spinning around. Even if I let go of the mouse, the game is still literally spinning in circles, the mouse sending some sort of garbage data presumably.Extremely disappointing. I've been burned enough with bug-ridden microsoft programs: now I've been burned by their trash hardware. I will never, ever buy another microsoft branded hardware product again. Never."
1,0 stars. This mouse does not work.,"The cursor jumps around at random, and Microsoft offers no support. It's baffling that anyone would give this a good review. If you buy something, it should do what the package says it does, period. I would gladly pay more than the price of this mouse to get back my time wasted with it."
1,Bad mouse,"I have a MS Optical Intellimouse at home, which is great, so was happy when boss ordered a dozen of these basic optical ones for work.Wow, they're really bad. Mouse pointer jumps all over the place whether using USB or the PS2/USB dongle (that is even worse).Brought in my Intellimouse from home, works a treat. So loads of these mice, tried on different PCs, all rubbish. I have gone back to the IBM 2 button ball mouse I was using :(all of us at work are disapointed."
1,Basic Failure,"The fundamental purpose of a mouse is to accurately move the pointer, a task this mouse fails at miserably. The pointer often jumps across the screen for no reason. I tried fiddling with the software settings, de-activating features, different mouse pads, no mouse pad, cleaning the mouse, and finally trying a new mouse. Nothing worked. I even tried Microsoft's recommended white-paper-mouse-pad ""fix"". Great idea Microsoft, that's just what I need, a paper mouse pad to accommodate your junk. (By the way, it still didn't work.) I've got a better idea: How about more rigorous testing of your hardware before unleashing it on the public?"
3,Good little mouse for my laptop.,I use it with my iBook G4 without any problems. And the price is right.
1,Not worth the trouble....,"I purchased this mouse as a replacement for a ball type mouse that had just plain worn out. The worn out one performed better than the new basic optical mouse! It's true: The pointer randomly jumps all over the screen. I tried it on my desktop and on a mousepad...no difference. I lowered the speed even to the lowest level...no difference.Having a pointer jump around is annoying enough while playing games, but it is downright dismal when working on important business spreadsheets.There is no support for the basic optical mouse at Microsoft. I'm not one of those compulsive Microsoft bashers, but they are taking the money and running with this product.Forget this piece of junk. Also forget the milktoast ""It's still a good buy for the price"" reviews. If it doesn't work reliably, it's a bad buy at any price."
4,A Good Optical Mouse Without the Bells and Whistles.,"I recently bought this mouse and I have to say, I am pleased with its performance. It's a basic mouse, two buttons and a scroll wheel, with a wired USB interface. Works flawlessly. No complaints here."
1,More of a rat than a mouse,This rat is moving all over the darn place. Where did it go? Stay away from this one and buy the Microsoft WheelMouse Optical instead.
1,This product is unusable in its present form.,"This mouse refuses to keep the cursor in place, but randomly jumps the cursor to the upper-right or lower-left corner. This is on a pure Microsoft computer running Windows XP.I have tried multiple mouse pads and every conceivable control panel setting combination. No driver update seems to be available from microsoft.com.My other mice (Microsoft, Logitech) do not have this problem. So, this product is going in the trash as soon as I buy a replacement from a different manufacturer."
1,Random Glitches,"We bought this mouse about 3 years ago,Cons:Somtimes it starts to randomly move across the page.Randomly JERKS EVERYWHERE IN RANDOM DIRECTS. (Video Game hazard)Somtimes it does this in a manner when you click, so then it gos up too the X on a fullscreen programso fast that you acidently click out of it. this has happened to me several times.....We found this SAME MODEL, in a free box, and it has the same exact problems, on windows XP, Ubuntu, AND windows 7Do not buy this mouse, unless you can get a super deal on them, (warehouse deal?)"
1,Jumps all over the screen,Bought two a couple of years ago. All have the same problem. It happens on all the PCs that I tried.
1,A serious nervous twitch,Although ok at first....this mouse is making me nuts. It continually jumps off my placement to all corners of the screen (mostly bottom) and is about due to be replaced..!
1,Basic doesn't means it won't work properly,"The cursor jumps, period, it makes the product useless, some people think that the ""basic"" word means you should forgive Microsoft for a bad product, I think different and I won't buy MS hardware again."
2,Microsoft Basic Optical Mouse,The item shipped was not what was in the photo and I feel it was misrepresented. On the item I received the top portion was one piece not like the original Microsoft mouse.
5,A good mouse at a good price,"I like Apple computers, but I don't like their mice so much. If you are uncomfortable about using a non-Apple mouse with an Apple computer, I can assure you that you don't need to worry. This mouse works fine with my iMac. The color matches nicely with the white iMac, the mouse feels comfortable, and it works great with the Apple software. I thought the mouse was a good buy at Amazon's price."
1,Unstable Mouse,"I purchased the Optical Mouse from Microsoft. It's now in a drawer being saved as a spare. I found a way to clean my old Microsoft ""ball"" Mouse and that's what I am using now. The old is much more positive with much more control. Would not purchase again."
1,peice of garbage,I bought this to replace a good working MS optical mouse which is grey in color. I wanted one to match the black LCD and keyboard I have so I bought this one in black. The pointer bounces all over the place. I now know why it was $[...]. What a peice of [...]. I will be returning it tomorrow.
1,Randomly jumps around,"I've used several of these mice now (at work, at home) with machines running Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP Pro and Gentoo Linux. In all cases, and with all samples of this mouse, the cursor will suddenly JUMP to another location. If you are playing a game, the view will suddenly jump somewhere else, which is not fun.Again, this is with several samples of the same model mouse (bundled with computers, assigned by the IT group, etc) on different computers, running different operating systems, and on various mousepads and desk surfaces. It's the mouse that is to fault. It has a flaw in it. Do yourself a favour and spend a few more bucks to get another mouse. This is odd because other Microsoft optical mice (higher end) work very well. This ""basic optical mouse"" is just not worth the annoyance of having your cursor jumps randomly at random times.Whenever I find myself faced with using this mouse, I'll go find a different mouse. I even prefer the old ""ball"" mice to this mouse."
2,A letdown in the genre of historical fiction,"This book had very little to do with the aforementioned painting and with Leonardo da Vinci in general, in which case I was let down because it turned out to be something I did not expect. Based on a true tale of Renaissance era power families in Italy, the characters seemed like mere ciphers who existed solely to report the goings on of the day. Essex seemingly couldn't decide between an historical work or historical fiction and, as a result, this book is neither. Given authors like Dunant and Gregory, historical fiction can be so much more in the hands of a gifted storyteller. This book was a disappointment through and through."
3,Enjoyable read.,"I chose this book because of my complete obsession with Anne Fortier's ""Juliet."" Wanting to keep that enjoyment going, I decided to read the authors who had reviewed ""Juliet."" Although I enjoyed Essex's historical novel, it wasn't as compelling as I had hoped. Essex's character development and visual imagery were quite wonderful. Her choice of plot structure, though, tended to plod along at the same level of energy: here's what's happening in Isabella's world; here's what's happening in Beatrice's world; here's what's happening ...., etc. I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone with an interest in European history and art. I especially enjoyed the window into the world of Leonardo's wonderfully unique character."
4,Fun read but don't take it as historical truth,"Readers should keep in mind that what they are reading has very little historical truth to it. Other than that, just have fun with it."
1,Dissapointing,"Despite spetacular attention to detail and cultural nuances, it proved lagging and drawn out. Don't write novels if you're not going to story well. The language doesn't flow. Poorly written, but the little views into Leonardo were great and almost made up for it."
2,A Little diappointed,"I was very excited to start reading this novel, but I became disenchanted with it rather quickly. The pace was a little sluggish and the story line left me wanting something more to happen. I didn't find myself really caring about the main characters as I have in other fictional writings. I really wish that the author had fleshed out the sisters more. Will probably leave in a library along our way.I followed this novel with I, MONA LISA,which I found to be an exceptional work also involving a DaVinci story line."
4,Of Swans and Ugly Ducklings,"I won't go into a description of the plot here, since so many other reviewers have done a great job of that. Instead, I'll tell you what I liked about the book.1. The writing is well done2. The storyline of two sisters, who sometimes act quite ugly to each other, is fascinating3. I really enjoyed the small parts where Leonardo is featured (however, they are small)This isn't too long of a book, so if you want something to read on a Saturday, or in a airport, I would pick this up, especially lovers of Italian culture and historical fiction."
4,Very informative!,"I really enjoyed this book for it's scholarly treatment of the material. It explains varying types of magic and shamanism in the Norse culture, utilizing first-hand accounts and primary and secondary sources. It explains how the ancient practice was accomplished and how modern heathens are bringing an ancient practice into the 21st century.People looking for specific shamanic exercises or activities will have to look elsewhere as this book is not a hands-on guide. It also is not tied to the ""ancient ways"" of doing things. Blain thoroughly goes over the historical texts dealing with magick and Seid but interprets them with modern usage in mind. Strict reconstructionalists will have a problem with this mind-set but I, for one, am not adverse to making ancient concepts accessible to a modern audience.This book is an excellent over-view of Seith! I enjoyed it very much!"
4,A good introductory exploration,"This was an interesting read...The author explores her own participation in a subculture as well as explaining the historal aspects of the subculture. She does a fairly good job explaining some of the historical roots, and to some degree the present activities of the subculture. She could've touched on the contemporary subculture more though.A lot of her analysis seemed focused on how she reconciled the differences between herself as a heathen and as an academic. This was particularly interesting, but what stood out to me was that she could never entirely just submit to an experience but was constantly analyzing it...so that for her it seemed the identity of an academic was predominant over that of a heathen. It does lead one to ask whether she really critically engaged the experience in and of itself or used the academic way of thinking as a distancing tool. Nonetheless she does question her own attitudes and this is evident in her work."
4,"Great, Great, GREAT album","This is my favorite Go Fish Album. Their ""non-acappella"" stuff just doesn't measure up. Well worth your money!!"
3,"Too big, too bulky, too bad to be good","I would have to customize the dash in order to use this housing. It's not a good enough looking piece to warrant doing that. It's functional, but hardly impressive. Good if you can make it work, I guess."
2,Too Big,"Have an 01 Crestliner fish hawk. This won't even begin to fit the factory opening (too wide).The Pyle's dimensions are more what I need.Don't make my mistake, measure your boat first.Quality seemed OK if it would have fit."
5,Jeep steering stabilizer,"Direct fit to replace OE part. Easy to install and it stopped steering ""wander"" @ highway speed.Rancho RS5407 RS5000 Series Steering Stabilizer"
1,not as described,"Item is not color of picture or regular shocks, it is liquid metallic. This is not a problem, but item was completely painted silver including rubber bushings (which should be black). This is usually not how a new item would appear from factory. Even though it came in a new box with with new attachments it looks used or refurbed. It appeared to be mechanically sound so I installed it anyway (didnt want hassle of return). Item seems to be working as advertised, so 5 stars for function, 1 star for fit and finish, 0 stars for not as described."
3,Good Western,"Kelton doesn't do ""shoot em ups"", but this book is more in line with the typical western genre. As always, a fun read with good characters."
4,Books,"If you ever read one of Elmer's books, you'll look for more of his writings, this one will not disappoint you"
5,under rated cd,this is the best cd out of all of drews famous music it has lots of dance music the techno song children is my favorite it also has madona vogue it has lots of underated dance music i use to listen to them durring my child hood in the 90s or 80s its when musicians use to use words that acutaly means something other than skeet or atagota berry
5,Owner,Works as advertised and worth the price. I bought one and used for a year and then bought one for every fan in my house.
1,Mind of Its Own/Losing my Mind,"I have been running 2 of these for about a year now. One in my Master bedroom and the other in my twins room. These units are a disgrace. For the price of the unit and what it cost me to install them, I couldn't be more displeased.I'd like to find the CEO of Hunter and break into his house every night at random times...3am, 4am, midnight....and just turn all his lights on.Last night was the last straw. 4:45am and this light goes on again in my toddlers room. Now the kids are up for the day.And this isnt the unit's only fault. The dimming/raising of the lights is laughable. It must take 5+ seconds for anything to even happen. This unit is a total disgrace and Hunter should be proactive in replacing these and never selling them again."
1,Doesn't work with all CFLs,"I love Hunter products but this one doesn't work with CFLs (compact flourescent lights). I am a pretty good DYI-er. However, this remote has a real problem with CFLs even though the control is advertised to work with them and has a toggle switch built into the remote for CFLs. Sometimes it will turn the lights on, sometimes it takes 5 minutes, sometimes they never come on. I would not recommend this product if you are using CFLs."
2,Unreliable,After installation everything worked just fine. A few days later the light control was very difficult to operate. Then by the end of the week the fan controls were poor. I went and bought a new battery although it really did not solve much. Even with no other fans in the home interference should not be a issue I changed the codes. The fan control worked fine but there were still issues with the light. It was not easy to tell my customer don't mess with the light part of the control as I can't figure out why it works poorly. I have installed many other cheaper fans and remotes but this overpriced Hunter is the only one with issues.
3,"Great idea, modest success","I was really excited about this book. Peas, peas and yet more peas -- it sounds like a great way to visually present the idea of exponential growth in mathematics. The execution of this idea, however, is only moderately successful.This is only my opinion and may not be true for all readers, but I found the presentation inhibited rather than clarified the concept. Sometimes two pictures were on the same page and the graphics were very busy -- many characters, inserts and dialogue balloons detracted from the impact of seeing a growing pile of peas. Perhaps you remember the film ""Powers of Ten"" that showed a couple picnicking and then distanced the camera from them exponentially; that film was elegant and evocative. This was pretty messy. As I said, though, this is my opinion and kids may love it."
4,Maestro of the ferns,"Writing reviews on art is difficult and, most likely unfair. After years of collecting art glass, I have learned just a little. My home is a virtual ""Glass Menagerie"". My collection overflows with vases and animals. I needed a human form desperately. Thus, the purchase of this lovely, abstract human form with wonderfully executed color in the lower body. Imagination gives it a round ,crystal head and long, thin arms that reach up and cross over. I had plans for this piece.But, art has a mind of it's own. Especially when it comes to placement.It seemed awkward in it's designated location, and that detracted from it's beauty. It had to be walked around the house in order to find a home.At last, it found it's place in the sunroom, among the flowers and the ferns. It conducts a symphony of sorts. At night, I can almost hear the music of the ferns."
3,Only for Newbies,"After reading this book cover to cover I found very few things that helped me (a self proclaimed tightwad).The book had a few good ""comics"" but I could have waited for the Sunday funnies. The recipes are terrible. A few tips for cleaning and sprucing up the house, a few forms, i.e. budget, shopping list, menu planning, last will and testament, but nothing much else. The 5 big tips that can change your finacial life are not new to the seasoned tightwad but could possibly help the newbie. This book is a waste of time and money for the seasoned tightwad."
4,"Middle-Agers need to be babied, too","A clever book, one that I often give to aging boomer friends, along with copies of ""Dave Barry Turns 50"" and ""Getting Old Sucks"" by Ed Strnad. They all enjoy it."
5,"Profound, realistic pictures of women's lives in China.","Seven women writers have written realistic stories about women's lives in the People's Republic of China. The book is informative and realistic, and moves the reader with compassion and admiration for women struggling to make good lives for themselves and others in a difficult world."
3,A glimpse into the lives of Chinese women,"This collection of short stories presents an interesting picture of life in evolving modern China. The stories are mostly concerned with the legacy of Mao's Cultural Revolution, so readers interested in the tension between tradition and the country's new-fangled hybrid of state-controlled capitalism might want to look elsewhere. Cultural interest aside, I found some of the stories a bit too sentimental, almost maudlin at times. Nevertheless, it held my interest and it provides that most valuable service of translated literature: it shows us that people in all cultures are more alike than unlike. Unfortunately, the people who really need to learn that lesson will never pick up a book like this."
4,Do your homework,"This works great,but the radius is small. You will get drop outs if your auditorium is crowded and your base sits at the level of your audience who are seated. So do your homework on distane from unit in your building...you may need something stonger."
2,It gets worse with every listen,"The first couple times I listened through the record...I liked it a lot. The more I listened to it, the less I liked it. I honestly can barely listen to it now. This is coming from someone that loves all of the previous records. The dvd's good and it's enough reason to buy it...but I really can't recommend the album. It gets old incredibly fast."
1,a joke.,"i suppose that i believed boysetsfire a little more when they were on indie label initial records. then they went to victory and put out after the eulogy which really has about 3 or 4 good songs, with ""rookie"" and ""still waiting for the punchline"" being the best, by far. then they signed to wind-up, home of such awesome bands as creed, finger eleven, drowning pool, evanescence and others. as you can tell, i'm joking. they wound up (no pun intended) on the daredevil soundtrack and this album still boasts some of the ""political"" lyrics but more of a nu-metal attitude. these guys were never really a hardcore band to begin with, but at least kind of fit in the whole punk scene thing. now, they just aren't good at all. it's a shame, sort of.<"
5,Most solid BSF album yet,"'Tomorrow come today' is the best album from one of the most talented bands I know. Their style is mostly emo, but there's a lot of pure rock and hard rock on their music.These guys are better and better in each album they made. This album is plenty of awesome songs: 'Bathory's Sainthood', 'Full color guilt', 'Handful of redemption', 'Last year's nest', 'High wire escape artist'...Wow, this album is really awesome.Lyrics are great, lead singer Nathan Grey's voice is great, guitar riffs are great...all in this band is great.If you like BSF, here's another reason to still being a fan, and if you're not, or if you don't know BSF, please listen to this album and you'll understand why this is one of the best hardcore bands in the world."
4,What the.......,I dont know what Erick Rialcel is talking about. Not every track sounds like rookie. Not even near. Perhaps 1 or 2 do but its just their style. It is a solid album with many different types of music explored. Great stuff.
3,good but not as good,"Boysetsfire is one of my favorite bands on earth, but i must say that i am a little bit dissapointed with this latest work. I guess we were all spoiled with ""After the Eulogy"" because it is one of the best albums out there. ""Tommorow Come Today"" lacks creativity in my mind. What makes Boysetsfire so great is that they are so politically involved and active. They are great at setting themselves apart musically, hard and edgy, but not quite hardcore. Unfortunately this cd is frighteningly....mainstream sounding. Still a good one, but if you are just getting into Boysetsfire, ""After the Eulogy"" will blow you away."
2,Please go back to Victory....please!,"So they got signed to Wind-up? No big deal right?...To me it is. That doesn't mean that they had too sell out to please a wider audience. People really caught wind of these guys after their last full length release ""After the eulogy"", on Victory Records...and what a friggin wicked album that was...and just over 100 000 albums sold...great for an indie band. I know, I know, Nathan and the boys have to make a living, but taking the song ""Rookie"" (by far one of their best), watering it down, duplicating it 12 times and calling the end result ""Tommorow come today"" does not sit well with me. Maybe the poor album sales will get them thinking and realize to stick to the wheel they've invented instead or re-inventing it halfway through it's life-cycle."
4,Good Strong Sound,"This latest album by Boy Sets Fire is probably their best yet. They have manicured their sound so that it is a bit more melodic while still keeping that hard edge that I love about them. If you enjoy bands like Thursday or The Used you will especially like this album, but I think people that mostly listen to punk or mostly listen to the nu-metal bands will also find elements about Boy Sets Fire that they will like also. All in all, a very strong production."
5,Beautifully written....,"As soon as I saw this book in the bookstore, I knew immediately that it would be a perfect gift for so many of the ladies in my life. During these days when we'd all like to know a little more stability and security, this book provides a source of strength without being silly."
4,Don't have DDR? Then start dancing!,"I get it, I get it. It has some confusing differences for veteran DDR players, and it doesn't work with all dance pads. But what about those of us who have only played DDR a couple of times at other people's houses? What about those of us who are just getting into this whole thing? What about those of us who are dying to do dances to weird songs no one would think of putting in a DDR game? If you fit into any or all of those categories, then direct yourself to the game and dance pad set right now, because you'll love this... perhaps more than DDR. (And if you fit into the last category... ""Kiss Kiss"" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs makes a surprisingly good dance routine.)"
3,Dance Factory,"It's a nice game like the original DDRs, but the ability to dance to my own music makes it a little sweeter. Sometimes the computer gets a little off the beat - I might be able to work out a more effective algorithm if I had tons of time, but I don't, so I like this one pretty well. Also, navigation is a little awkward at times. Overall, three stars for originality - and leave two open for when they work the bugs out."
2,Doesn't work with wireless dance mats,"I think that I would really enjoy this game-- if I could play it. I was so excited to make my own dance CD (I love DDR to work out to, but the euro beats get whack, fast). I loaded up the game, but when I went to play, the arrows on screen didn't link up to the arrows on the pad, but to the X, O, square and triangle on the outer corners. This is completely bizarre as the proper buttons work when you are in the menu and set up modes. After reading a few other reviews that mention this posted here and on game forums, I wrote the the Codemasters customer service. They claim to know nothing about this as the game works with all the wired mats they tested. So apparently I am out for the purchase, which seems extremely lame since neither the website nor the package indicates a problem with compatability. Boooo."
2,Not quite there,"I read all the reviews before buying this, but my family loves this game, so decided to see for myself. I don't mind the length of time it takes to process the dances, but two things really ruin it.1) The up and down arrows are switched from the normal DDR positions on PS2. Even though I never go off of Beginner level, it still threw me. For my Heavy level son, he played about half of one song and re-booted in disgust.2) I made it through about 3 songs before I called it quits. It would get the beat right about half the time, and then it would pick up something like the guitar riff and just go nuts.I'll be trading in this game really soon!"
2,ok,This game was ok but it was no where near as good as ddr. I liked the fact I could dance to my own music but the dances are not fun you have ti make them for it to be fun and it can be hard to make them.
1,Goo Goo Revisited,Playstation had a game just this and it was called Goo Goo Soundy. That game never worked right and neither does Dance Factory. The dance routines it creates are simplistic and sometimes off the beat.
2,hrm...,"I really like how you can dance to the music you choose. This is a huge plus.I have to agree with the other reviewers. What is with the arrows? I am really good at other DDR games, but I can't seem to quite catch the arrows at the right time. It tells me I have a lot of ""perfects,"" but I can't figure out where the right timing is.The beat and tempo of the steps is odd, too. Like there's 3 beats to a measure or something.It's also difficult to figure out whether there are two arrows on the same line or if they just want you to him 'em really fast. If you play this game on a large tv (ours is 51 inches), you may never be able to tell with certainty. And the arrows are spaced far enough apart from side to side that you have to use crazy peripheral vision to catch all that's going on.It's still a fun game, though. For the price, I'd recommend it."
1,I returned this CD,"Here is an e-mail I sent to the manufacturer....I justbought your album, Electronica thru Amazon.comI read the reviews,and said to myself... how bad can this be?Let me just say... you exceeded my expectations... this is one of the worst ways I have found to spend money.I DJ weekly at an under 21 nightclub, mixing up house and trance. I thought this would be a good way to reduce my load of classics by consolidating!What a mistake.... these songs are not by the original artists, and are poorly remixed... Which is I guess why the Artist names are not listed on the CD... certainly not strong enough to play in a club, they definitely lack the power the originals have. By the way did I mention it would be nice to use the originals... and spice them up a little... to each their own I guess...Anyway I guess I am the moron, for not listening to the reviews...."
4,Simple but good,"This is one of many books on the topic of acceptance and nothing on the surface makes it stand out. But I've read it and its simple and down-to-earth style in no way detracts from some of the good points the author puts across. Given its fair price, this book is worth reading for those interested in the topic, namely, seeking acceptance of whatever they face."
2,Junk,"The cameras only work from about 3 or 4 feet from the base station then start to break up with static. They initially interfered with my WiFi greatly, but I changed the channel on my router and it helped (although they do still interfere it is usable at this point). I put two of them in the same room about 4 feet from each other and put the receiver in the middle of them on the floor, then ran an RCA cable under the floor to my computer in the other room. They transmit audio and video, which is nice, and the audio is clear. They have a nice fairly sharp picture during the day, but the IR LED's night vision is pretty useless, all I can see are the license plates and headlights of the cars in my driveway (even with a light turned on,albeit a dim one), and the IR LED's will reflect at night if you plan on putting them behind a window. Don't waste your money on this system; for $250-300 you can get a real, fully working 4 camera wired or 2 camera wireless one."
2,Annoying Problem,"The first thing I realized when unboxing these cameras is the fact that they dont pivot in any direction, only up and down. BIG problem when you're putting them on a wall and are trying to point them left or right. Funny how no one mentioned that. You cant flip the camera on its side because the image wont correct itself. So im going to either have to spend more money finding a decent swivel mount or ghetto rig something in order to have the cameras point in the direction I need them to point. BIG UPSET. Image is clear and IR works ""ok"". Color doesnt work unless camera is next to the base. (Which is a rip) Audio wouldnt work first time I plugged in. Had to unplug and replug a few times before it started to work. Not a good first impression of Nortech for me. Low end low budget cameras right here."
3,FAKES,"I just bought these items. And they work decent enough. Not real clear, but decent enough for ID most likely. But they are canceling out my wireless router (internet) 100%. Trying to find a way to get around it."
5,GREAT SYSTEM AT A GREAT PRICE,"This security system is super easy to install, set up, and start using. Since its wireless- You can change the position of the cameras whenever you want without hassle. Very easy- plug the receiver into the av inputs of the tv.I was so pleased with this item, I bought a second set."
5,Much more then you may expect.,"If you have interest in the beautiful craftmanship of armor and weapons created for the LOTR movies, this is a must own. In fact, this is a must own for any interested in LOTR period. The book is comprised of over 60 short chapters chock full of pictures, illustrations and war maps covering addt'l back story on characters, people, battles and locations. Interested in what really happened in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men? The history of the weapons Sting and Glamdring? Why Weathertop and Amon Hen was built? What Aragon was up to before and after the events of the War of the Ring? I have read the Hobbit and LOTR multiple times, and although this embraces the movies, I learned alot of interesting facts. This book adds more depth, storyline to the movies and will wet your appetite for tolkien's work. Well written, fascinating and informative. My Highest Recommendation."
4,"""This is a good sword...""","This book focuses on the armies and weapons of Middle-Earth as portrayed in Peter Jackson's trilogy. The text describes numerous intimate details, from elven battle tactics to Uruk-hai training to the slight details of Gondorian armor, while it is well-illustrated by dozens of color photos from the movies, along with line drawings and maps. A glossary included at the back identifies many kinds of medieval armor and weaponry depicted in the movies, and could be at least as useful for someone interested in medieval and Renaissance era warfare as a LotR fan.Be warned, however, that this book follows Peter Jackson's trilogy closer than Tolkien's. Since Tolkien did not describe many of the armor and weapons of his warriors in much detail, and said even less of their training and battlefield organization, the author has improvised in many areas."
5,"Fun to Read, and a Fantastic Reference to Tolkien's World.","If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings and the great battles between the forces of good and evil, then the ""Lord of the Rings Weapons & Warfare"" is an essential addition to your personal book hoard.1000+ color photos and drawing illustrate all the weapons of Middle Earth, the battles and the strongholds of the land.Learn about the weapons of the elves, the elven shield, bow, sword and fighting knives.Read about famous swords such as Hadhafang, Narsil, and Sting.Read about the Orcs and Cave Trolls, daggers fashioned out of horn, and the Mumakil a creature of legend as fabulous and fearsome as a dragon.Elves of LothlorienBows of Middle EarthThe Black Gate of MordorThe BalrogUruk-haiDwarvesThe Men of Gondor...And much more""Lord of the Rings Weapons & Warfare"" is a great book. It's fun to read, and is a fantastic reference to Tolkien's World."
5,Awesome Book!,"This book offers a great overview of all the races and prominent characters from the books (movies). Better yet, you get an in depth look at all the weaponry and armor designed for the movies, how it was designed, the historical development of each weapon (in Middle Earth terms), and a detailed look at how each weapon is deployed by the race that uses it.Lots of detail!"
2,"Great material, poor condition","I very much enjoyed reading this, except for dealing with the pages that fell out of it! I've never hesitated to purchase used books through Amazon before, but this may change that."
2,"Interesting, but not Tolkien's Lord of the Rings","This is an exceptionally detailed and well written book, with great artwork, and a thrilling read.BUT, a word of warning - it's not TOLKIEN'S Lord of the Rings, but Peter Jackson's. The author seemlessly mixes his/Jackson's inventions and additions from the Movie Trilogy to the original source material by Tolkien himself, without distinguishing the source.As a book to enjoy in its own right I can't fault this. But if you buy it expecting authoritative information on Tolkien's world, prepare to be disappointed."
3,Let the movie be the movie . . .,"Chris Smith's books is a wealth of images and information about all the stuff the a Tolkien geek would love. That includes me. However, my quibble, already suggested by other reviewers is that this book often takes the same liberties with Tolkien's stories that Peter Jackson and his writers took.I believe it is important to let the books be the books, and the movies, with all their own changes to the story, be the movies. Both are enjoyable, but they are different. Unfortunately, when the movies spawn their own accompanying print support that purport to tell Tolkien's tale, with all of the movie alterations, there is something disingeuous about this. It left me feeling considerably unsettled.Weapons and Warfare is an interesting look at its subject. Weapon and armor buffs, or Middle Earth wargamers will enjoy the pictures, but take the text with a grain of salt. After enjoying the movies, I encourage all to read The Lord of the Rings."
5,The Lord of the Rings Weapons and Warfare,This book prefectly describes the weapons made for each race in all three of the movies. I highly recommend it to anyone to buy and read.
5,A keeper,"The details and background are invaluable. With a few exceptions, the photographs are clear and beautifully rendered. My 7 & 10 year old daughters, who love the movies and books, were so captivated by the book from the library that we had to buy this our own copy. Because I saw how the library's copy had been so well used, especially by my children, when mine arrived from Amazon I took it immediately to a bookbinder so that as a hardback there would be less chance of pages falling out after constant use and travel from van to vacation to home and even under pillow at night."
4,Great easy way to learn,After many years sitting on the side lines watching I decided to try Shawn Trautman's dance instruction video .My wife is a great dancer but I'm a terrible dancer .We tried dance lesson after watching Bristol Palin on Dancing with the stars.Things were going good until they changed my wife's work hours at the hospital.MY wife is my high school girlfriend but we just recently married 35 years later.So we were both pleasantly surprised when we received Shawn's video in the mail .After viewing and dancing a long it was so easy.Great instructions clear video easy to follow great sound quality they have split screen to show the foot steps at the same time. Now were ready for more lesson from Shawn vast collection .Can't wait to try more of Shawn's video and to take my sweetheart dancing again .
2,More Soggy than Crunchy,"This collection is very uneven and doesn't consistently capture the essence of Crunch beat. A better workout can be had listening to Techno Party, Teaches of Peaches, or the Dumptrucks Fat Clone Family. This collection is more suitable as a sampler than as a workout album."
4,Makes me happy!,"I am not fond of rating 5 stars just because you never know, however...I have been a windows user all my life. I just switched to mac and found myself lost. Do I use a program like fusion? Well, that wasn't going to work because I would still need to purchase windows since it came with my computer I won't be able to use the same software. Plan B...Microsoft Office for Mac...uh uh, there was no trial period and I refuse to pay 100+ dollars on an item I don't know I would be pleased with. Well, iWork had the trial. I loved the templates. Looks better then stuff I've seen on office and it is easy to use too. As far as those who don't have macs I save it in a PDF format and problem is solved. I just wished I would've bought the family package because this house is going to switch out to MAC!!! Long story short...I recommend it!"
2,Numbers is NO Excel!!,"I have been a Mac user since 1985 but for the last 10 years, I've used Excel for all my work spreadsheets. When I heard that ""Numbers"" was ""just like Excel but better,"" I happily bought iWork thinking I'd convert all my boring Excel spreadsheets into these colorful, attractive presentations.I was disappointed to learn that you cannot ""freeze panes"" in Numbers (an Excel MUST), you cannot TOTAL up several rows like in Excel unless you manually create a formula and drag it around (Excel does it automatically) and lots of little things are missing as far as Sum, formulas, etc.I created some letters in Pages but could not email them because my email system does not recognize the document format (and the people receiving them were on Macs so they couldn't have opened them anyway!).Beware - Numbers is NO Excel... :("
5,Best price anywhere,"Arrived early, brand new, I installed it that day and it is working perfectly. I give this seller my highest rating."
3,Not a great update,"This is a quirky upgrade that doesn't address the shortcomings of the previous version. There are some new features that are helpful, but I find myself (darn it) going back to Excel and Word, though, being an Apple freak, I'd like to avoid them.As an example, in ""Numbers"", it is impossible to print just a section of a spreadsheet (as in Excel ""set print area"" command.The graphics in all 3 programs are awesome, but Apple seems to have ignored functionality for presentation. I'm not happy that I upgraded."
2,iWork 08 Numbers is not an Excel Substitute,"Apologies for those not using Numbers, but there is no method to review it separately.iWork 08 numbers is missing a subtotal feature.This makes it entirely impossible to use to examine budget data (e.g. how much I spent at the grocery store last month).If you are looking to use iWork as a substitute for MS Word, you'll be doing okay, but Numbers is simply not a good Excel replacement."
3,Not advised for people who use both Macs and PCs,"I use PCs at work and school and a Mac for all things personal. iWork is fantastic by itself, but I have tons of minor issues when I need to convert into a .doc and edit with Microsoft Word on a PC. There are some odd, cooky formatting annoyances when making the transition from Pages to Word that I hope one day Apple will work out. Example today: I was editing my Masters thesis last night on Pages, and when I opened it with Word on a PC at work, some of the font sizes were a different and my titles and headings were no longer centered. Trying to center just one would center the ENTIRE 50+ page document. Very annoying. I had to erase whatever I needed centered and retype it (including recreating tables). This happens pretty regularly... other times, the font style (italic, bold, underline, or back to regular) just won't change at all and I have to retype everything.But if you don't use Pages on Mac and Word on PCs interchangably, go for it."
5,iWork 08,"This lovely intuitive group of programs has allowed me to effectively set up my home office. I can now run my household well and as a 24/7 caregiver, you can never underestimate this. iWork is easy to adapt to and easy to use with fantastic tutorials by Apple. All you really need to complete your basic IMac are iLife 08 and iWork 08. Highly recommended for Apple Users."
4,Not too expensive but enough functionality for most.,"Some users might need the additional stuff that comes with Office, but the price tag is ludicrous for ordinary users who just need basic, functional software. For most people, myself included, all of the extra features included with Office are just bloat which never sees any use at all. iWork is a nice, simple productivity pack that provides a happy medium between basic built-ins and high-end packages like Office. It does everything it needs to without a price tag that makes you cringe. Great for home or student use."
5,Excellent,"Apple iWork '08 has a clean interface, is horribly easy to use and contains all the tools I need to run a small business. I am extremely happy with this product.Don't let the beautiful templates fool you. I had Office 2004 on my Mac, but since acquiring iWork have deleted it."
3,"iWork '08 by Apple, Inc.","Not as easy as AppleWorks 6.0. The Spreadsheets especially are difficult to complete, even using the iWork'08 User Manual (download) and the iWork '08 'Getting Started' booklet that comes with the software. I had amuch easier time creating my own 'drawings'; spreadsheets; charts, etc when I had only my AppleWorks torely on. The word-processing (Pages) and the various 'templates' work fine -but- I still miss my Appleworks.I know Apple, Inc. has to offer PC/Microsoft compatibility in order to compete in this market--I just hope they(Apple) do not lose sight of their primary MAC customers. Profit is one thing but customer satisfaction is something totally different [and absolutely necessary]. Getting the consumer to come back, each time, is themost important thing Apple should be doing at this time."
3,This product is good but could be better,"This product is practical and very good, but I wish that it was possible to use a tool to type and print envelopes."
5,Better and Better than MS Office,"As with other Apple programs...it looks good and is more intuitive out of the blocks than M S. I use m s office all day at work and get tired using software that has a clunky user interface created by unimaginative nerds from the Apple commercials. MS programs by comparison are just a small step above DOS.Come to think of it...why do people even use windows pc's anymore?When I switch from my Mac to my PC, I sit and wait ...and wait...and wait...and then it freezes......and then I switch back to my Mac.I do my Keynote presentations at home...export as Power Point..then load at work."
5,Excellent Program,"This is a great program. I've never been a PC guy, and I've always used Appleworks instead of Word, so I don't know how iWork compares to Word. But this is a really great program. If Appleworks is rubbing two sticks together trying to start a fire, iWork is lightning. Excellent program. I love it. DON'T HESITATE TO GET IT IF YOU'RE A MAC USER!!"
4,Good basic suite of applications,"Now that numbers has been added, I think this is a great suite of applications. It may not be as powerful as the Office suite, but for me it works just fine. I think the recent Office 2008 issues will drive more people to try this out which will only make this a stronger product in the future. It is simple and easy to use, great for a home user."
2,Numbers! BOOOO!,"I bought Iwork 08 ultimately because it was a low price and usual updates don't change the product all too much. I just needed a spreadsheet program for my grocery shopping system. I needed to be able to change text direction, hide columns, and freeze panes. All of which I am unable to do!!!!!! Sure I think they solve the freezing panes issue in the newer version but that is not good enough. You can insert text boxes to turn your text but when you need to copy and paste that text into another cell you are faced yet again with an issue. I am not an avid Excel user so it surprised me that 3 of the things that I do often on Excel were not included in Numbers. I am getting Microsoft Office. I can't live like this! ;)"
1,Very disappointing! Still need office,"Pages is not really a word processor at all. It is, at best, a mediocre page layout program. The spell-checking and grammar-checking are basically useless. In my mind, spelling and grammar are as fundamental to word processing as are cut and paste. Apple has been on a real role lately that I had really high hopes for iwork. It doesn't take long to find out this product is just plain junk. I'm sorry I bought it and will go back to office."
3,Good but not enough,"While it's great that Apple has added its own version of Excel, I'm still underwhelmed by the number of templates available in Pages: Apple's answer to Word. I tried to find a template for a simple thing like a daily ""chore checklist"" for kids, and there was nothing there.If I had it to do over again, I'm not sure I would have spent the money for this upgrade over iWork '06. But it's a solid upgrade so I give it 3 stars."
1,Pages is still useless.,"I recently downloaded the free trial of iWork 08, to see if Apple had managed to fix the Appleworks import crashing bug that has been present since the original release of iWork. They have not. In addition, they have discontinued support for Appleworks. If you're considering purchasing iWork with the idea of reading all your old Appleworks documents in this new post-Appleworks world, you will be sorely disappointed, as Pages bombs on importing about half the Appleworks documents I've tested with it. Appleworks 6, by contrast, opens them without complaint."
3,"Nice stand-alone product, but...","Nice product with terrific templates. The ability to open and process Excel files is fairly limited (no support for Pivot tables among other limitations). Unfortunately, this suite is not a replacement for MS Office in a business environment."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't buy iWork 08. Apple knows that any doc made with 09 version will not open in 08 version, and they refuse to update the 08 software to add compatibility. At least Microsoft products are still backward compatible."
2,Good for a game,This is exactly what I expected. I pretty cheap felt to throw down for a game. It seems to be wearing down very quickly and leaves little green fuzzballs all over the place. I wouldn't buy it again.
4,sturdy,The green cloth was very sturdy. I used the plain green side for a setting for a poket table display with pre made poker hands and chips for a poker theme for our wedding. I got some glue on it but it came right off after it dried. Unfortunately they sent me the wrong one which is why I used the blank side.
2,Item does not match picture,I'm very disappointed with this item. The item that I received does not look like the picture of the item that I ordered. The picture of the item that I ordered had 5 places for the cards to be placed in the middle of the felt for Texas Hold'em. The ones that I received did not have this and it matched a version that I already had. The material of the product seems ok for now but time will tell as we are deployed so we will have to see how they will hold up. I would return the item but it's a huge pain since we are deployed. This is the second time that I've ordered something from Amazon.com this deployment and did not receive what I was supposed to receive.
3,Got wrong item,"I wanted this but did not want to spend 12 dollars on a piece of felt so decided to get the amazon fulfilled used one for 6 dollars. I got a completely different one. I received one that was this size, but just had a white oval in the middle. Not what I wanted."
5,GEORGE JONES STILL THE BEST,George Jones for years has been the best and only gets better with age. I love classic country music and gospel. George Jones is a classic and his treatment of these old gospel songs sent chills down my spine. I have been a country music fan for all my 65 yrs dating back to when it was called hillbilly. There have been many great singers but no list would be complete without George Jones and The Gospel Collection is one of his best.
5,George Jones Gospel Collection,George is still a great singer and I was so glad this cd was available. The songs are great with good music and the true stories about Jesus. I have not got into praise music even though it is the most popular so I am glad the good stuff is still available.
4,George Jones Gospel collection,"This Gospel collection from George Jones mixes the unique voice of one of the greats with the best old Gospel hymns that just get you where you live! Love it!! The order came exactly as expected, exactly when they said it would."
4,gospel collection,This is one of the best for those that like gospel music. These songs remind me of my mother especially. I can hear her sing way up in heaven. I also purchased one for my sister as a special birthday present that I will give later this year. I recommend this to anyone.
5,"George Jones, Gospel","One of the best albums George has made in several years, he is one great singer."
4,Good little product,"Only drawback is the case they come in. Other than that they work as advertised. If you need a set of allen wrenches, here you go!"
5,Good Stuff,The item is exactly as described. It shows everthing needed to beat the game easily. Great on showing all bonus features too.
4,Worth the money for most.,"This book is worth it. Why? Two words for you:Skill Map.That's right; a full-sized (and smaller sized ones in the book) of the skill map for your characters is included as a poster, along with ALL of Rikku's attacks.Nuff said.The book is an excellent example of what a hint book should be. It's nothing you can't get if you aren't internet savy, however, the convience of having a full-color guide in your lap while playing is invaluable. And for the skill map which you can uh, mark your progress on with a post it note. So you don't study any erroneous paths accidently. Not that I would do that myself, heh.If you're heavy into the weapon-customization track as well, this is handy for assisting you in getting the blade/staff/whatever of your dreams if the Ultimate Weapons don't quite cut it for you.Downsides: some of the area diagrams are off. The items listed that you can find in a few cases are incorrect as well. Other than that, it's pretty decent."
5,Helpful Book!,"This book offer tips on how to defeat enemies and provides a detailed list of all enemies's HP/MP amount, what their weakness and strengths, and even mentions the items you'll if succsfully defeat, steal, or bribe them successfully. The maps are accurate, so you never get lost. But the book is most helpful when you're at the temples trying to place the orbs into the correct pedstals in order to unlock a secret passage.The guide also gives information on where to obtain secret items to power up your party members to their fullest potential. In addition, they're also secret locations you can go to and fight extrenely powerful monsters so you can level your party members faster.Looking throughly into the enitre book, there's no misspelled words or incorrect grammar, and the information is accurate. As far as credability goes, this book is a winner!"
4,A very helpful guide,"Normally strategy guides are for those ones that get stuck and need some help but just to get through it and leave it alone, others will follow the book by the letter and make sure not to miss a thing. I'm the latter. It will frustrate you when you don't know how to beat this boss, not realizing you got the wrong equipment or the wrong strategy against him. The guide is quite helpful in figuring out where to go next. There was one minor problem is that they do show the weapon list but they've got it alphabetically so that you aren't sure whether this new weapon for your character is the best one. But other than that, it's a great guide to get you out of those rough situations."
4,Good Book,"Helped in some complicated situation, very good quality for a book, in color,i received it very quickly with the other final fantasy book that i had ordered. very good product"
3,The Good The Bad Or Just Plain Cheating,"This is what I hate. After I bought the book, I found a really great website that gave me most of the information from the book.I thought ""Why didn't I just go on the internet and get a few cheats!"",since I only needed it for one part of the game. You shouldn't waste your money on this if you have the internet. But one question, do you really want to spend money on a book that you're going to only use once,then throw it out,or do you want to get to the end knowing that you beat it all on your own? That's what being an avid RPGer is all about! Also they left a certain part out that I despratly needed.The book and the internet did not supply me with this info. But don't worry, even a person who isn't very great in RPGs can beat it with ease."
2,prev owner wrote all over the pages,All the pages are there that's a plus but most all the pages have been written on. The guide is still readable but with all the extra continent from the prev owner in it and the book was pretty bent and worn I think it should have been at a cheaper price. Overall though it gets the job done(though its done by the same people who did 9's strategy guide)and i am happy with my purchase.
3,a must get from final fantasy fans,Book in good condition very helpful help me a lot but it did not come with the poster in the back but still helpful I love my book could not get though the game without it
5,Great info,"Just received this walkthrough guide.I played through and it's pretty specific (not boringly so).It has some helpful hints, trust me, I've played FFX about five times through.The artwork seemed official and was much appreciated as well."
3,Abstract writing?,"Basically a good story, taking place in and around Cimmaron, New Mexico, a locale that I have been to and thru many many times with the St. James Hotel as the central focal point, Blue Mitchell, horse trainer/tamer extraordinaire is the main character, the villan Albert Buckminster is nothing but a murderous drunken slob, also a beautiful young lady who apparently loses her mind though its really not clear just what happens as she had been a very strong person just a few pages previously, a stilted abstract style of story telling that was hard for me to appreciate."
3,A must have for die hard go-go fans!,The cd has a nice opening with the intro and then everything gets started with playa haters. The rest of the cd is tight but it sounded like it would have been better if it was gone live. Other than that the cd is banging and a must have for all die hard go-go fans.
3,"Good movies, but AMC pulled a fasty here...","Three of the four titles herein are long-time personal favorites of mine, so I was excited to get them all together on one collection. Since they boasted the AMC name and MonsterFest logo, I assumed (wrongly) that they were mastered from the same prints as AMC used when broadcasting these titles. They are not. These are well-worn video dupes of well-worn 16mm TV prints that would not pass today's rigid broadcast standards. In fact, the old VHS versions I have of ""Brain That Wouldn't Die"" and ""Atomic Brain"" are much cleaner than these. Alas. Still a nice treat for fans and the menus on the DVDs are fun. Enjoy."
1,Cheap junk,I guess I should have known this was too good to be true. Piece of junk. Jammed every time I tried to use it. Gave up and switched to me staple gun. You should spend more and get something that will work. Live and learn!
5,Best rechargable we have ever purchased,We have over 16 Flashlights being used in our facility. We were using rechargable Maglights. Since swithing to the streamlight rechargeable I have not had to replace one flashlight. A forklift drove over one of the lights and it still works. It is a different shape but it still works. One of my mechanics has an older rechargable streamlight (4 years or older) and the switch would not stay on. I took it into a Streamlight dealer and they replaced the switch while I waited at no charge. The flashlights are guaranteed. I love these flashlights. They are very bright and extremely durable.
1,Switch bad,"I have had 3 streamlights. One I lost and two I use for work. So I thought why not have one for the house. I bought this, shipping was great, and the package came in perfect shape. The bad part is the switch on the flashlight worked only when it wanted to. The Stinger, Non LED light is always a good choice."
1,Very disappointed,When I got this book in the mail I was very unhappy. The book was not in good condition and it looked like fruit punch or some red beverage was spilled all over it.
3,"Good quality, but not very functional","I've had this set for about 6 years now and used it quite a bit. As is the case with most MSR products, the quality is good. The pots are very lightweight, well-coated and the grooves on the bottom keep the pots in place while cooking. However, the entire package is huge and unruly, especially for backpackers. It also doesn't fit together securely, even in the included mesh sack, which means the top section is constantly coming apart from the bottom. I usually just leave the top ""skillet"" at home instead of having to deal with it. I've also managed to dent 2 of the 3 pieces so far, likely a result of the lightweight materials used. The bottom of the pots stains easily, especially when using a multi-fuel stove, but that's purely aesthetic and doesn't effect the performance. Overall, this is a decent set, but just seems dated and non-functional. I'm actually shopping for a new kit-type set now, which should also tell you something."
5,The best I've ever read,"The book's more addictive than La Reina Blanca. From sunrise til sunset, I sat glued to it. The very best book I've ever read. How can I tell it's the best? Well, I'd never finished reading a book, let alone doing it in 7 hours."
2,Too Far Fetched,"i really enjoyed the Great White Lie so i bought this book . not believable 2 thumbs down , way down"
5,AMAZING,"This book held my attention the whole way through. I picked this book up at my local library on sale for 75 cents, never before hearing about it and its probably one of my favorite books of all time!...Loved it...read the entire book straight through never put it down till I was finished which wasn't all that long since it was such a good book."
5,A Must Read Adventure Novel,Mike Levine has led a life of mythic proportions and this book is a glimpse into many real life events that he has experienced.Adds a new dimension to the term conspiracy theory.Check out his Radio show on Pacifica network.
5,Very effective,"This book covers several broad-spectrum major health problems - like diabetes, asthma, arthritis, obesity, back pain, etc.The exercises are very effective and work.A great supplement to conventional treatment."
5,Sweet music,"This is some of the best jazz piano I have heard in a long time. It has some familiar tunes played beautifully. After hearing, it I immediately ordered two more of his albums. It is good easy listening. Gilson Parenzzetta is a great musician."
2,Spain's history,"Eloquent writing that gives you almost no tangible information about Spain's history at all. Skips over most of the roman empire invasion, briefly discusses moorish conquests but doesn't even describe where the moors came from, and skims over one of the most important periods of Isabella's rule. A lot of writing, very little information or history."
1,A tough read,"This is a relatively short book covering 2500 years of history. Unfortunately, rather than giving us a good overview of the different periods and the main players, the writers fill the book with names and towns that confuse the reader and make it difficult to follow. I was very disappointed."
4,good stuff,"It was really well organized and added good tid bits to along with the facts presented. Unfortunately, a ttimes the author used terms that needed to be looked up in the dictionary."
2,GOB IS HERE...uh...yay?,"This was the first I had ever heard of them, after countless folks raved about how good they were. I saw them live before I heard this, then went out and bought it because absolutepunk said is was the best pop-punk album of the year.UM, yay? More like ""what the heck is this?"" It begins really well, Lemon-aid is an awesome song. Then it gets blah until ""Give Up The Grudge"", then blah until ""I Hear You Calling"", then blah. Certainly not what I was expecting. Seriously, this cd sucks. It's not the best pop-punk of the year, it's just another ordinary, generic pop-punk cd that will be raged over for any amount of time, then forgotten.Sorry, fans of Gob, but this cd doesn't hold up to scratch. Maybe World According to Gob is better, maybe not, but I'm not about to give them another chance here."
1,talentless mtv friendly crap,"Imagine taking all those terrible bands like simple plan, good charlotte and avril lavigne and rolling them into one. Not a nice image well thats Gob for you. This band a) seems to have a serious lack of originality or creativity b) can barely get past power chords or poseur punk cliches c) are trying too hard to be sum 41. You only have to listen to 'Give Up the Grudge' it is practically a total rip off of sum 41's nothing on my back.The only people this album will appeal to is a bunch of stupid 12 year old kiddies who think this makes the rebellious or something the rest of us true music fans are just left wondering how long can these wannabe's continue to spew out this cloned teeny pop rubbish?"
3,Shut up whiners!,"Admittingly I was at first disapointed when buying this record. I was familiar with ""Too Late ...No Friends"" and you put this CD on and at first it's kinda blah. But after listening to it a few times it's pretty good. Like I said not the same caliber as the others but it's worth a listen. And there are some who wanna say ""It's not as punk"" but does it really matter? These are all around good songs especially ""Give Up the Grudge"" which takes shots at hoiti toti whining upper class. (Kinda like a ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" Sequel). ""Foot in Mouth Disease"" puts [bad] life situations together with catchy tunes. If you have a few extra bucks buy this. It's not the best but it's pretty darn good."
2,MORE is less than I expected,"I like the IDEA of this book but I found the end result to be less than breathtaking. Certainly there are a few (very few) spectacular pictures, but there are also a lot of very mundane ones. The photographer, Teller, seems to like the effect of a flashbulb bouncing of his subject's face creating glare and eliminating detail (most people would just say the pictures were overlit). There is no text in the book, just pictures; not the text is really required, but it's one more thing that you aren't getting for your money. Had the book been a lot cheaper I wouldn't be complaining, but overall I get the impression that this ... book was slapped together in just a few days."
1,poor quality even worse customer service,"Purchased in June 2007, the remote control suddenly stopped working. Universal remotes do not work with this product. Obtaining a replacement has been taking over 3 months. To purchase I had to send a money order as that is all they accept for payment. Each call promises delivery in a week. The product is fair at best and the customer service is poor. I would not purchase another Coby product based upon my experience."
3,suspicions have risen,"As has been pointed out in previous reviews, the claims made by countrygirl958 are suspect... but NOT when compared to the movie descriptions on the box housing these DVD's... which is almost word-for-word what was written! More unsettling is the fact that we may have been gypped! Timings on these films are not what are advertised. ""Dementia 13"" is 74 min., not 81 as the box claims. ""Frozen Alive"" according to all info I've been able to obtain, should be in the neighborhood of 80 min. A version to soon be released by ""Alpha Video"" claims the film runs 77 min. This AMC box claims 81 min... WRONG AGAIN! The film contained on this DVD runs 63 min!!!!!!!!! Something here isn't right!! The public relations department of Genius Products have been notified regarding this issue.As the old adage warns........""Let the buyer beware""."
5,"""Best six dollars I ever spent.""","great, truly the best book ever, Rucka is the Shakespear of the 90'"
3,The Guy was still a stupid body guard so far.,"""How did you get my phone number?"" Guy doing body guard business, and didn't know when the ""Caller ID"" technique marketed? This kind dialogue should not have appeared. And why Rucka could not make his tragic hero a bit smarter? Or he simply couldn't make him smarter? I've never read any book that a guy doing security business and making it as a living is so pathetic and stupid. Rucka is a readable writer, but why he always failed to make his characters just a bit smarter and not so disgustingly moronic? This is the 3rd one of the series, just wishing some improvement would happen in the forth."
2,A bodyguard's life is pretty slow...,"so is this book. Being knowlegeable and sometimes interesting is not enough to carry this story, especially with an unsatisfactory ending. Better next time, I hope."
4,Wonderful all-around teaching guide and reference,"This well written, concise book explains all aspects of a technicians job. It touches on hospital, retail, and long-term care settings. It is a good book for anyone who wishes to learn anything about the technician profession. A definite reecomendation from myself, a tech with 7 years of experience from retail, mail-order and hospital settings."
4,Entertaining and informative,Being a fan of Coast to Coast Am I found the book to be entertaining and informative. One of the better celebrity autobiographies.
4,An entertaining insight,A pretty good autobiography considering Art Bell is a radio talk show host first and a writer second. Not as good an example of the genre as Howard Stern's Private Parts. If you are an Art Bell fan you will find it to be an entertaining and informative glimpse into the life of one of the top radio talk show hosts of our time.
4,A very informative book about the author and his life.,"Art Bell and his talk show has kept me glued to the radio many a night.In fact he still does with his unusual subject matter of astral projection,psychic spies,remote viewing and government conspiracy theories.In this book you'll get a chance to meet the exceptionally bright and witty man behind the mike.You'll also get to see pictures of his travels around the world as well as gain a more in depth understanding of Art's personal views on things which he often refrains from discussing on his program in order to let the guest speak his/her case."
2,"Not too ""Art""-tistic.",Somewhat rambling life story of the talk show host Art Bell. If you wade through the rhetoric you'll find interesting glimpses of Mr. Bell's history.
3,Not a great book but...,"Art Bell was not a good writer when this book was written. This book reflects this. Lately, having read some of Art Bell's columns in the After Dark Newsletter, his writing has greatly improved. This is the first hurdle you have to jump if you are to enjoy this book.Another hurdle, you have to be a fan of Art Bell. In this book he discusses some of his personal history, but doesn't go into a lot of detail. He also does not give any tips to people interested in talk radio.Personally, I loved it.So, if you're willing to handle substandard writing, lack of depth, and aren't interested in getting into the profession of talk radio, then you will like this book. If you fail to meet these criteria, don't buy this book. If you are interested in conspiracy, UFO's, and weather, by all means buy some of Art's other books, this one does not go into any of that though. This book targets a very small market of people; before you buy, make sure you're in it."
1,Too bad trees were killed to print this crap,The only thing bigger than the Universe must surely be Bell'sego. The ravings of this wacko cult-promoter are of interest only tothe seriously reality-impaired.
1,"sorry, but it's lame.","transparent attempt at some cash, it sounds likethis was knocked-off in one session. straight-aheadreadings on Beck's numbers except lacking the soul andfunk of the originals (which is usually Dr. Smith's forte).whether you're a soul jazz fan or a Beck fan, you're likely to find this uninspired and boring. adds nothing to the music.too bad. it could have ripped."
1,"One good song, rest are duds","Dr. Lonnie, what's the problem? You give us one 'A' cut (Paper Tiger) and the balance of the album are all 'B' filler songs. Additionally, the B pieces all sound like they come from the 1970's. What a waste.Dr. Lonnie can move and grove you, but someone torpedoed this album and its overall rating is: A clunker to avoid.Go with Dr. Lonnies other albums which are winners."
5,Great,"This was easy to install and holds my PS3 out of the way beautifully. I'm very happy with this shelf, and the price was good too!"
1,Knock Sensor,"Just received this knock sensor and was under the impression ,by the picture, that I would be receiving the cable as well.I could find a better price but needed the cables to relocate the sensor. Not impressed"
3,"Not bad but I recommend ""Rockin' Sports jams"" Much More!!","I love sports cds and i own a lot and this ones not bad but its a little cheesy. and i f you like sports cds I recommend these next few... Rockin' sports jams, the jock jams,slams,and rocks series and the greatest sports rock and jams series."
5,"Very durable, strike zone has numbers not shown.","This pitching screen is very durable. It's heavy material and can be left hanging outside in the weather. The bottom has drain holes. The grommets are double stitched and will hold up over time. I did not purchase the frame to hang in as you can hang it from any fencing with bungy cords.It is not pictured but the inside ""strike zone"" is numbered in squares of 1 through 6. This way you can really get your pitchers to hone in on certain areas. My 9 year old uses it and only aims for the 3-6 boxes because his batters will be shorter. My older son practices his curve ball by aiming at number 1 and then seeing if it drops to number 6.Screen is pretty heavy so you'll need two people to hang properly. On bad weather days, it hangs in the garage from the garage door framing and they can still practice pitching. You'll need to purchase your own bungy cords."
3,You don't get whats pictured....,"My fault for being a visual person. I thought we were getting the stand with this. However, why show the stand if that's not what your selling."
4,"Product itself good, but not what was advertised.","The canvass itself is quality, but despite seeing it with the frame on Amazon's web site it does not come with the frame. You have to call the company that makes these to get any help, and of course they don't see just the frame. You can hang the canvass and it's works fine, but overall a little disappointing as we still cannot find where the frame is not included on Amazon' website."
3,Not what I expected.,"I expected at least 60 minutes of Eddie Griffin, but he is on for only about 10min+. There are a number of comedians in this show. They are mostly average to above average, but they tend to tell the same jokes that have beome cliches in Black comedy: niggas vs african americans, how to avoid paying utility bills, black vs white, sex acts, etc. Don't get me wrong, there are comedians who can incorporate these topics into their acts and get away with it, but this lot don't.There are a few good laughs including Eddgie's antics with a dwarf, but on the whole it is not worth seeing more than twice."
3,sorry to say,this was funny. pretty funny but it wasn't as funny as I would have hoped. But still a good buy none the less.
2,The hottest thing you will ever sit under.,"It does do well in wind and sets up quickly, nice piece of gear.Except for one thing, I don't know why but the material seems to collect and radiate heat to anything under it. If you plan on using this in a hot climate, this is not good. Humans under this thing in the summer will bake. Next time I use it, I might try to see if a Space blanket can be configured on top of it some how."
4,A Scholarly Work,This is a scholarly work that is well cited from esoteric sources. Excellent research was conducted to arrive at this interpretation of history.
3,Comprehensive and packed with references and often contradictory or confusing facts,"In lack of a better alternative, a good place for a beginner to review evidence for the existence of the Khazars and the period when they seem to have viewed themselves as Jews. Includes interesting insights to the period, surrounding nations and circumstance."
4,Great book showing the latest actual research on Khazaria,"I truly wish most of the people citing or writing about this book had actually read it. This is the first worthy successor to DM Dunlop'sThe History of the Jewish Khazars.It is a shame that Shlomo Sand, author of the ideological fiction known asThe Invention of the Jewish People, did not actually read it."
1,waste of money,"i tried them as they are mentioned on bottle, and use to do my regular workout, no use at all, waste of money"
1,Just another pill on the market,The only results your going to get while taking this suppliment is through your own hard work in gym...not from what the suppliment claims to do.
2,Not worth it,"I noticed absolutely nothing after these pills. I continued to diet and exercise as usual but felt absolutely nothing from taking these. No more energy, no more weight loss. Even taking the daily 6 pills at once seemed to do nothing. I would not recommend this product. Im sure their is something better out there"
1,terrible book,"This book has nothing to do with fairytales except for that you might be able to pick out a character here and there from the pictures in a ""Where's Waldo?"" sort of way. The story...well isn't even a story. It doesn't rhyme or make sense. I can't believe that this was published. I bought this for my daughter's 1st birthday and it was a major disappointment for me. I would not purchase it again. Infact it almost needs to visit the garbage can. A waste of money."
4,Nuttier than squirrel fesces...,"This nuttier-than-squirrel-fesces band just got crazier. While getting more insane, they also display some better structure to their music. I'm pretty sure Chris Arp is a Transformer. His guitar playing is like taking John Coltrane from his wildest heroin days, and transposing it into hardcore. The clean jazzy passages are about double-speed from the former release, and are an example of the step-up they took on this recording. Autistic-ally mind-boggling.From a distance, their music to the ear is mediocre at best. The vocals are totally out of place and don't enhance the experience much. But if you hone-in to Chris Arp's inhuman guitar skills, and drumming that is right alongside his finger tricks, that is when you will discover the true diamond of this band."
1,WTF ???,Wow is this stuff boring.Songs w/no real structure And the singing? doesnt even match the music.Fast & erratic is the best description i can give this.How do bands like this even get signed?Only recommended if you want a headache.....
2,pointless bandwagon jumping,"If listening to Dillinger Escape Plan's Calculating Infinity makes you think ""why can't more bands try to sound like this"" rather than ""why can't creativityless trendy little [...] just leave this alone"" you will enjoy this album. add this guitarist to the ""proof virtuosos have no creativity"" file alongisde vai, satriani, and malmsteen."
2,Smells like alcohol,"I buy wig spray for two main reasons: to condition my wigs and to give them a nice sheen. Additionally, I like for the spray to have a nice smell especially since I'm using it on synthetic hair. Well, I do not like the spray because unlike the name of the spray, it provides no luster, shine, or sheen to hair and it smells like straight alcohol which is a turnoff. The only benefit is that it slightly conditions but considering the other drawbacks, it is not worth the money."
1,Lied about shipping!!!!!!,"The sellers of this book, advertise a low shipping cost. But when you receive the package you are going to be surprised by the extra shipping charge that the Post Office is going to lay on you. That's right this seller stuffs this book into a small flat rate envelope that exceeds the size limitations. So the post office turns around and charges you the recipient. Of course you can deny picking it up, but if you're like me and need this book for school, you really have no time to send it back. My advice, only buy a book when Amazon stocks it, otherwise Amazon will do nothing to get your money back as in my case."
2,terminology !!!,this is one of the terible book that i ever have in my life. This book i would say it is belong to digital terminology rather.
4,Good general review of the NY region,"For the novice, such as myself, this is a good book to get you started on exploring the canoeing areas of New York. They review the area, the water, and the wildlife. It is not an exhaustive list and many areas we found were seasonal, but that wasn't mentioned in the book. I hope they write another updated and more exhaustive review in the future."
5,Great service,I had lost my original copy and was I thrilled to find a replacement. Much better price with this one.
4,good,good book to reference for the area. Have used it several times.also good for ppl that like fishing. Also good for kayakers.
3,the concerto aspect,They probably added the guitar concerto because it was one that Garoto premiered back in the day.
2,For the money...,"For the money I would expect sturdier poles. The first time we used the canopy one of the connectors between the segments of the poles broke apart. We have jimmed it back together but the pole hasn't been the same. I don't have much faith in the canopy and only expect it to last 2 seasons at most. I would have returned the product after my first outing with it if the process wasn't such a pain in the butt. For the money of this one canopy I would suggest buying several cheapos, each of which would likely last just as long. Wish I would have bought a model with a vent in the top as well."
2,Hm - junk?,"Same problem as others - one of the struts broke on the 3rd use. No wind, no abuse. I'm on hold now trying to see what the repair parts or warranty coverage is going to do. Not as well built as the 5 star reviews say - apparently some people see far more build quality than I do. I can fix it myself but it's the principle - it shouldn't break that fast.Updated 4/2/2012. I fixed it myself since the warranty return process was a total pain and not worth the effort required. This weekend under pretty bad conditions (40 MPH gusts) it simply exploded, breaking in multiple locations. I had it set to 1/2 height covering our MX bikes, bungeed down as best we could. I threw it out afterward. Not sure anything else would have survived either."
2,Frame broke on 3rd use,This is soon to be thrown in the trash unfortunately. I used this at an art fair for only the 3rd time and it got damaged by strong winds. A storm picked up and naturally I made it my 1st priority to take down my artwork and put it away safely in the car. While I was doing that a bad gust caught the tent and it twisted it at the corners and SNAPPED the support arms in half at 3 different points where they bolted together to another arm to form the scissor joint. I called Wegner and asked to purchase replacement parts and the customer service rep wasn't the least bit helpful. He said they don't have spare frame parts? Really? Guess I should have bought an Easy-Up instead.
2,Not typical swiss gear,"It took two people great difficulty to set it up. Instructions warn against one person set-up and I can't imagine how one person would do it anyway. Four people are really needed for safe set-up and take-down. Two of the four sliding poll clips did not slide at all. Other two clips did not slide easily. Watch your fingers raising the polls. Don't let children set-up or take-down. There is only one position for the legs even though the instructions say otherwise. Polls are OK, but won't last very long with a lot of set-ups and take downs. Cover seems well made is is the best feature. We are sending it back."
1,The 20 MPH wind destroyed it the first weekend we took it out.,"Flimsy, Chinese, Garbage. Don't buy it unless you want to use it indoors. And even then, you don't want to lean against it. It's such a nightmare to ship back, we just threw it in the garbage on the way home."
4,Swiss Gear 10x10 Canopy,This is the second Swiss Gear Canopy we have. We bought the first one based on the reviews and price. We were not disappointed. The first one we have used about 10 times in two years and has held up well. My only suggestions to Swiss Gear it to make the bag big enough to hold the tent material and design a Canopy that keeps the tent attached to the frame.
1,Very cheap and cheaply made,When product arrived we tried to open as directed but found it very difficult to do so. When opened noticed the support brackets were very thin-----hard to believe they would withstand 2 or 3 more opening and closings. In addition when unit is collapsed the top has to be removed. All in all a poor value and not very easy/quick to open or close.Would not recommend this to anyone
1,Works just fine...,"... as long as the wind isn't blowing.The canopy broke on the first use. I set it up with the optional Swiss Gear Smart Shade Sunscreen/Windbreaker on one side and used the 4 stakes and guy rope to hold everything in place. The next day, the wind picked up a bit and blew the canopy over, breaking the frame in 3 places. The aluminum frame is very thin and crimps easily. The plastic brackets that hold the aluminum pieces together are also very flimsy. It's going in the trash."
3,I enjoyed it until it broke...,"For what it is, it's a great shade canopy. I was quite satisfied with it for 2-3 years. Quite recently one of the cross beams snapped out of place during set up on a camping trip. As other reviews here have stated there are no replacement parts, so I broke it down and tossed it in the dumpster. The guy managing the place said they see a lot of broken shade canopies, so just know that these products don't necessarily carry a long shelf life. It was always set up with two or more people and I would say that we took care when opening, closing, and storing it. Need a new one but reluctant to buy the same product because of the end result, we shall see..."
1,Company does not honor warranty,"I ordered this canopy on May 1, 2009 and had been using it for less than a month. One of the cross bars bent at the end where it attaches to the next one. I called customer service twice on Monday to resolve the problem. Each time I was told someone would have to call me back. Wednesday, after no one had called, I called a third time. Customer service said that it ""must have been the weather"". They would not honor the ""10 Year Warranty"" and could not sell me a part to repair it. I liked the canopy, but apparently it is not very durable."
5,Best EVER,This is the first tent I've used like this - but it worked great. I used it this past weekend for a 3 day art fair and it held up in rain very well. Never leaked and held up great in slight wind with no sand bags etc. My father has been to many softball tournaments for my sister and he's seen many similar tents get mangled by the wind or break easily. The push buttons are great and keep me from pinching my fingers too. I've had no problems at all with it. :)
5,Works Perfect,"We bought this after a very hot camping trip with no shade. After looking around and doing some research we settled on this product. We used this camping again with a slight wind and it was perfect. We took to the ocean on the beach during a strong wind and had no problems whatsoever with it. Held up great for 5 steady hours of wind blowing.Pros:Sets up easilyFeels cooler than other shadesfeels sturdyCons:I wondered if the legs would give in the wind so I think a relief flap or something would be good, but again it's still in perfect order and nothing happened so I guess it might not need it."
4,Great Canopy,I really wanted a screened in patio but the budget said Swiss Gear Canopy with screen. We have only had this for a few weeks but I love it. We have it on our patio and with the screens we are able to sit and enjoy the outside without the bugs.We also ordered the Lasko 4900 Pro Performance High-Velocity Utility Fanand now we are really loving being outside in this heatwave we have here in the south. The screen was pretty easy to put together. My husband and son had it up in minutes. You will not regret getting this Canopy[
5,Quick setup-great canopy!,"Setup is quick and easy. Good quality, sturdy canopy provided great shade at the beach."
2,Flimsy quality; hardly worth the $$. Keep looking and spend $~40 more.,"Unless you plan to use this canopy in an area where there is essentially *ZERO* wind, continue searching. You may spend an extra ~$40, but the investment would surely be worth it.This canopy is easy to set up, even for a single able-bodied person. The white vinyl canvas helps reflect UV light which helps keep the shade it creates relatively cool. Sadly, these are really the only good qualities about this item. As others have noted, it's lack of a vent in the ceiling means the canvas top catches any wind that enters. The weak aluminum frame and legs cannot and will not withstand any form of movement from even the mildest of 'steady breezes'.This product looks good online in picture form, and with a zero-wind environment it looks decenet, but it's cheap components and lack of a vent in the top of the canopy to allow air to escape render it virtually useless for most practical purposes."
1,Poor construction,Spring on one leg was defective after one use. Made whole canopy very unsteady and toppled over in light breeze.
2,"Good frame, poor fabric",Bought this item five months ago. Top is now dissolving from the sun. Frame is great but very weak fabric with no replacement available.
1,flimsy shade canopy,This is a very flimsy canopy. Support legs are not sturdy enough to hold up the canopy in even a light wind.
1,Swiss Gear Canopy,"I purchased the canopy for the beach, and used my own strong (augers) to anchor the tent (used on previous canopies). Despite this, the tent frame bent and collapsed on the beach in a very mild wind gust the third time I used it. I have used other canopies similarly designed (but heavier) and thought this model would be better, (it was easy to roll in the case with wheels), and the top fit well on the frame....I am very disappointed."
3,"Take it, or leave it","We bought this canopy from Amazon. We also have the screen and the side panel. The fabric parts and the way everything works together seems to be good quality. The frame, however is a different story. It always seems touch-and-go when we're putting it up. I'm never quite sure if it's going to go up, or crumple into a mess of metal. It never has collapsed on us, but once, on our back deck, the wind bent one of the cross beams where it attaches to the next cross piece. We've since taken it off our deck and have used it for a camping trip, a garage sale, and a cookout and it's still working. I think it's just a matter of time before the metal snaps, though."
5,Great value for the money,"I bought 2 of these canopys for use at an outdoor exhibit space at a trade show in Las Vegas. The convention was offering rentals at 3x the amount to purchase these 2 units. Obviously the rentals were commercial grade, but mine held up just fine. Easy to put up, stake into the ground. We had sun and it was windy off and on. They shook more than the commerical grade but didnt show any signs of breaking down. For the price you really cant beat the quality. They lasted the 4 days I needed and are still in perfect shape so I am going to use them at home in the back yard and for future shows."
3,Not a puppet,"I found this product by searching on puppets and believed at the time I purchased it that it would be a puppet. In fact, this is a small stuffed animal."
4,Dr. Seuss Horton,the toy is very cute but a little smaller than I had hoped. I would prefer to get on a bit bigger next time.
2,Different from image,"My son received this stuffed Horton for Christmas. The picture on Amazon makes it look like this is made of a very soft material, however it is not. I was very disappointed with how different this toy was from the picture. Contemplated returning to Amazon, just wasnt worth the hassel. Would definitely suggest looking elsewhere for a Horton toy."
4,Dr. Seuss' Horton stuffed animal,We are having a baby shower with the Dr. Seuss theme. This stuffed animal along with the Dr. Seuss book is perfect for the expectant mother.
2,Cat in the hat,"I was disappointed with the size of this. Add stated 12"". The add does not state it is a Beanie stuffed animal nor does it state the 12"" is from the top of the hat to the end of the tail. Which makes this small...as I said Beanie baby size. For what the price was I think its quite misleading. If I hadn't desperately needed it because it was a gift from ""Santa"" I would have returned it."
2,Way overpriced...,"I think I just paid $14 for something that could have come out of a Happy Meal. Not overly pleased, but I guess if my nephew likes it for Christmas, all is not lost..."
1,don't expect much,not at all what I was expecting. Seems to be poorly made and rather sickly looking for a toy that is suppose to be for a child
1,Not as pictured!,"Do not buy! I just got mine and it looks nothing like the nice one in the picture. It is much smaller than you would expect, and it is scruffy looking for a lack of a better word. Like cat in the hat with rabies. It's not cute as pictured. I am not happy and will be returning!"
1,Nothing like what was pictured. Completely Unacceptable.,"I knew this was going to be small, but what I received was NOTHING like what was pictured. It is the most scraggly looking thing I have ever seen. You can barely see the face, the fur is a mess, it is skinny, the feet look different, it just looks completely different. It's almost like they ran out and substituted it with a completely different product. I wish I could upload a photo of what I got to show how much it DOES NOT look like what is pictured."
2,Not what I expected,"What came in the mail, doesn't look quite like what is pictured. It's a lot smaller than I expected as well."
4,Cat in the Hat for Diaper cake,I was unable to locate one at my local stores so I ordered this one. I was concerned by a review that it was to small. The box it came in was small but once you take the Cat out it fluffs out to a decent size and made a very nice topper for the cake. It has shaggy fur which just needed to be finger combed to make it look less shaggy.
3,Much smaller than expected,"Yes - the description says it is a small, but I had expected something larger than this 7 inch doll. It is however very well made, and my daughter was very excited to receive it. But considering the price, I had higher hopes."
1,Short straps,"All previous reviews stating the straps are too short are 100% correct. I'm 6' 200 lbs. and let all the way out I couldn't even put the pack on. My wife is 5'8"" and while she could get it on she could not comfortably wear it. It did however fit our 2 yr. old daughter well. She wears size 4T. Do not buy this pack as most likely it will not meet your needs."
1,Cheap plastic clasp,"Nice bag with lots of pockets and storage. Half way through the first use, I noticed the front clip would not stay attached (the one that holds the large inner pocket flap down). Not real useful if items can fall out as you are putting the bag on or taking it off. Bag was not overloaded. It held: shorts, two t-shirts, sweat pants, change of underwear and lotion.Too bad, it held promise as a day to day or gym bag."
5,NICE,THIS WAS ACTUALLY BETTER QUALITY THAN I WAS EXPECTING FOR THE PRICE. IT IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER 'VINTAGE STAR' GREEN PACK THEY SELL.
3,Kinda small,"I'm a small woman, 5'3"", and this pack is almost to small for me to wear even with the straps all the way extended. Probably great for a little kid but not an adult. Though it is well made it's just not for anyone with broad shoulders."
1,An unscholarly disappointment,"I've never studied much about the Holy Grail, though the occult is a long-standing interest of mine. I thought that this book might be a good place to start an exploration. It looked short and sweet, and the editorial review here was favorable. Boy, was I wrong! The facts that Griffin cites don't substantiate his conclusions, and he doesn't even attribute them. The book (or at least the first few chapters of it, I stopped reading midway in disgust) is full of lofty references to the breadth of research required for a study of the Grail. If Griffin did research, I didn't find any evidence of that. (Footnotes, man! Footnotes are your friends!) And also, even though my understanding of the history and legend surrounding the Grail is extremely limited, he didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know. Very disappointing."
5,Great Album,"Thrum is an incredible collection of music from an amazingly talented young guitarist. The compositions are all very interesting and his style has aspects of Scofield and Kurt Rosenwinkel and he plays with a fairly bright, clean tone. Definately worth checking out if you haven't heard him play yet! One of the best jazz new players Australia has to offer."
2,I've heard better collections,I expected more from this CD. Some of the songs aren't even in stereo. Sound quality is very poor for many of the songs. Look elseware for better collections.
4,Ultimate Disco cd,"Takes you back to the days of the glittering ball and the endless dance clubs. Funny thing is that I wasn't a big fan of disco in it's day but seeing what music has become these last few years with mostly talentless posers who think they're performers, I've come to realize that a lot of the disco era had some very creative, harmonic and sometimes beautiful music to offer. This would be an album to have to re-exam what that era had to offer."
1,Big disappointment,This is not a Disco Collection. Only a few of the numbes are and the rest is amature at best
1,Zero stars is more like it,"Music fans beware! Anything from the ""Drew's (in)Famous"" series consists of poorly done soundalikes, NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS and NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS! It's about as bad as the soundalike songs used on CHiPs and Knight Rider back in the day! Avoid at all costs!"
1,DEFINITELY A TURN-OFF!,"Honey, if you put this cd on to get your special someone in the mood(as well as in the sack)-IT WON'T WORK! This Drew's Famous Party series is getting way out of hand now-I cannot believe folks are gullible enuf to buy this garbage. I myself had the misfortune of hearing one of the Drew's tapes over a friend's house & it was so bad he ripped it up & stomped on it. For romantic mood music, stick with Mathis, Cole, Sinatra, anybody but this awful stuff!"
3,Plastic is pretty hard - not chewy,"I saw the rubber-looking sections of these and thought it would be chewy. It's not. For the most part the whole thing is hard plastic. Some of the sections have a different texture or coating (like a thin rubber coating) but my baby didn't care for this at all. It's fairly large, relatively heavy, and frankly it felt more like a toy than a teething ring. I tried over and over again to get her to use this, but she would put it down after a few seconds every time.In the end, the Vulli rubber teethers were what she liked best. Nom nom nom chewy goodness."
1,dangerous&#65281;,"The item breaks in to pieces in a month, with sharp hard plastic edge! When I found it was already broken, and small sharp pieces were around my 6 month baby. Cannot imagine if she eat the parts....I have many Munchkin stuff and they are all very good, but this teether is dangerous!"
2,pinched fingers!,I thought this was a neat idea until my little guy started manipulating it and collapsed it into the figure 8 and pinched his fingers--hard! Not using it with my youngest.
3,Too awkward for babies,I thought this twisty toy would be something new & fun for my 5 month old to chew on. I'm not a huge fan. Mostly because I think it's too awkward and big for a baby to try and hold and get their mouth around. She hits herself in the face a lot too trying to get it into her mouth. Maybe when she is older she can play with it just for fun but as a teether it's not functional.
2,Too big,"Because of the bright colors on this items, i though my daughter will love it. On the internet, it looks like the teether was small enough for a 5 and half month old child to hold. But when i got it, i was not impressed at all. It was too thick for her to grab, and will not even fit her month either. So, now it is in the box with the rest of the useless items that will never be used again"
2,Fun teether but hard to clean,"I bought this teether for my five-month old, but ended up returning it because it was not dishwasher-safe and can't be submerged in water to clean. I wanted to be able to do both, so this teether was not good for me."
2,Dirty 4/10,"This was not in a package and looked like it had been used as a hockey puck on a factory floor. I purchased this as a gift so I had no time to exchange. So I hag to boiled it to clean it. Remember, this has to go in a babies mouth for teething. I should not have had to do this work!"
4,Great Teether,What I like most about this teether is it has different textures on the rubber parts and you can twist it so the toddler can chew on the portion that feels best on their gums.
2,not so interesting..,I bought this for my special need preschoolers that are learning to chew. Chewing teethers and exploring their mouths is developmentally appropriate to develop good biting and chewing skills. These children are developmentally less than 12 months but they did not find this interesting enough for them to explore.
3,Just okay,"Nothing overly impressive here. Thought it lit up or made some sort of noise, my son (1) is teething and he loves to chew on this, im just scared he is going to pinch his lip while twisting."
4,Good teether and fun for play,"This is a fun toy for babies as the sides move into different shapes. The plastic surfaces have various textures for chewing and touching. Simple, yet a great product. I recommend it."
5,Twisty teething fun,"This was a gift for my grandson. I liked the colors, the textures, and the price! The perfect gift for any baby."
3,"NOT GREAT, NOT BAD","My 4 month old finds this teether's colors enticing and although its easy for him to grasp, the teether is overall too big for him to control. Also It will not stay the shape you put it on. I twisted it to make it more manageable for LO, but after him playing with it for a minute the shape was undone.In general its not too bad considering it is not a pricey item."
3,It's ok,"I think if my son used this teether, it would help but he's finicky and likes teething/chewing on his own hands better."
4,Fun for my little one,I bought this for my daughter when I realized she was teething. She likes the different textures on her gums.
4,A toy that engages all the senses!,"My son is 4 months old, and he loves this toy! It's great for teething and for developing motor skills at the same time. I stuck it in the fridge for soothing his gums. It also has small beads that rattle in certain parts, which helps him with developing his hearing. The bright colors stimulate his eye development. To engage the fifth sense of touch, it has multiple tactile surfaces that allow him to feel what different surfaces are like. It's a great toy to sooth teething while engaging all the senses!"
2,Not too happy,"Wasn't too happy with this product..bought it for my 4 month baby..but the material is too hard.When my baby plays with it, it hits her head and she begins to cry.Would have liked it if it was lighter like normal teethers are."
3,My baby think this thing is boring!,"I like it. Good quality, nice color, good price but my baby think this thing is boring! So only 3 stars!"
5,Daughter loves it,"It's hard to go anywhere without this. Our daughter loves it. It twists, shakes and has several different textures for a baby to enjoy"
3,It was kind of big...,I go this but it was kind of big. My baby girl is 5months and she overlooks it. She tosses it and moves on to other toys. I will try once she get older. I hope it will get a better review!
5,Great stocking stuffer,"Needed something for my 10 month olds stocking at Christmas. He loves this toy and grabbed it right out of the stocking. It is a great buy, great price."
4,Great toy,"This is a great toy because it's sturdy, moves, colorful, and has smooth a raised surfaces. My 4-month old loves it. I'd give it 5 stars but it's too thick for her to suck/fit in her mouth, so it doesn't work as a proper teether, yet... but she still manages to get it slobbery and really enjoys holding it. Would definitely recommend."
5,Munchkin Twisty,"This is THE ONLY toy my son was interested in before he was about 3 months old. He has loved it since he was about a month old and is still loving it at 7 months. From twisting and turning it to using it as a teether, it's always a hit.I would disagree with a previous post that it is hard to grip, it has always been easy for him to grip- that's one of the things we loved about it. However, I'm sure this varies baby to baby!Especially for the price, you can't go wrong."
2,not interested...,"I thought it was cute, just isn't interested in this at all, zero, waste of $ for me. He doesnt even like to chew on it. (teether..???)"
5,Great teething toy,"My son loves this teether. He loves moving things and this is great for that since it twists and turns. My husband and I actually play with it too sometimes! Great teether and also great toy, it keeps my son entertained for a long time. (He is 6 months old)"
3,too heavy,"the different textures are good, he likes to teeth on it, but it's heavy and every ounce in awhile he whacks himself with it"
3,just ok,"I don't dislike it enough to return it, but I certainly wouldn't buy it again. The ""twisty"" part is pretty hard to twist. It's awkward to move it around, I thought it would twist more freely. I'm sure my daughter will like it as far as a colorful teether, but don't buy it thinking it's gonna be all cool and bendy and twisty."
2,Disappointed!,"I bought this(2) months ago to keep at our house for my now 8-month old grandaughter. It's terrible for a couple of reasons.~ Way too big for a teething infant to hold never mind put in their mouth - what were they thinking?~ Can't be put in dishwasher or soaked in the sink (just run it under water)Overall, a total waste of $5.00. I'd recommend seeing teething products in stores before randomly picking something out on line like I did. There are definintely better products for the price out there that your baby will be able to handle and enjoy."
3,Ok for the price,"Given the price it's ok... bought it for my 7-8 month old, he played with it for a bit, but the hard plastic sections aren't very chewable... he doesn't really chew it, and because of the shape, he can't use it as a teether for his back gums, only for his front teeth. He's 10 month old now and likes the fact that it rattles when you shake it, so he's started to play with it a bit more... all in all, it's an ok toy, cheap enough to get to try but not expensive enough that if your baby doesn't take to it, it's not a big deal. I don't regret my purchase, but it isn't a big hit with my baby."
3,toy,"This is more of a toy than a teether. At 9 months, it is not something he chews on even while he is teething."
3,Good but not impressive.,"I bought this for my nephew and he seemed to like it for a little bit here and there, but I don't think it provides as much relief as he wants to. It's a lot ""harder"" than I imagined it to be but it's not harmful to the baby at all. It has a cool twisty motion to it that my nephew looooves to look at happen.I would recommend this product, but don't have intense expectations I guess. It's a good teether to have around for variety."
2,too thick for baby to chew upon ...,My son who puts everything to his mouth did not find this interesting .. it is too thick to comfortably put in mouth.
1,Baby is not interested,"The product pretty much only has 2 textures, rubber & plastic. The product overall is a good size but each section is small, too small for the baby to get a proper ""bite"" on the section he may be interested in. To top it all off, the ""twisty"" of it actually made the product less enjoyable as the baby could not get a consistent grip/bite as it would twist as he grabbed/bit.Do the baby a favor & just get him the cheap little teethers that are filled with water."
3,"Pleasant the eye, but hard to grip","I bought this teether for my 5 month old twins. Its fun to bend and twist into different shapes, but overall its pretty useless. It may be more handy for a baby 8-12 months old. The figure is too big to fit in my babies hands and mouth. They become frustrated very easy and simply drop the teether. For babies age 4-6 mo. I would purchase something smaller in size for tiny hands and mouths."
1,Baby doesn't care about this toy,"My baby is 7.5 months. For the past couple of months, she doesn't care about this toy at all. I don't know why! I think this is a great toy and she loves simple toys (no technology infused into it), but she doesn't enjoy this toy. I intend on continuing to expose her to this toy, but I've lost most hope....UPDATE 9-14-2012: Now, I do not like this product at all. Occasionally, my daughter will play with this toy. She is now 14months old. Today, she was twisting this toy (a trait that is advertised) and she got her wrist and finger stuck, where her finger was being pinched. Considering that this teether is for a baby, this product should be safer instead of possibly pinching fingers or becoming an unintentional colorful handcuff for babies/toddler.I do not recommend this product."
2,Ho hum,"My child has no interest in this. But it is well made and twisty and colorful so overall it is a good product, it just seems to not catch any interest here."
3,Good but haven't used,This teether is nice but we haven't used it as we don't have children. I believe it would be good as I have taken care of many children and seen these kinds of teethers before. It's also gender neutral (which is what we are going for right now).
5,More beautiful than the picture.,"I loved these earrings the minute I saw them. When I got them they were more beautiful. Delicate, yet dangly, they are great for casual or dressy."
3,Preen garden weed preventer,"We followed the directions to the tee. We put it down before we mulched. And a few months later we put it down again. When we came back from the North in Sept., we found many weeds and grass. We were kinda disappointed as preen is expensive.Sue/Dan"
4,An excellent book on alliance networks,"Alliance Revolution is without doubt the best book out there dealing specifically with alliance networks and constellations. It should be helpful to anyone who has to wrestle with structuring or managing alliance networks, or cope with the impact of such networks on their industry or business. A serious, thoughtful book on a topic few executives can afford to ignore."
3,"Nice Collection, But....","I am an experienced puzzler, but I am also seventy years old. The only real knock on this collection is that they mixed different sizes of puzzle. Many are just fine, but I can't do the smallest sizes without a magnifying glass, and even then it is hard. S&S has other collections where this is not a factor, I recommend them."
3,Truly Beautiful Music by Palestrina,"What a wonderful selection of pieces on this CD, including motets and a glorious mass not often recorded. The sound is warm and sumptuous and the singing committed and generally uplifting.However, the Vienna Vocal Consort does have some intonation problems. Most of the motets come off well, with the odd uncomfortable moment. For me, the biggest disappointment comes in the beautiful mass. For example, when the Kyrie eleison returns after the Christe eleison, all of a sudden the pitch is quite markedly different. One presumes that neither the recording engineers nor the director took time to make sure that the different sections matched pitch-wise. There are other similar (though less drastic) problems elsewhere. The result is quite disconcerting which is all the more disappointing when the music itself is so special. I am sure that this group has great potential, but this disc leaves room for improvement."
3,Not sufficiently clear.,"While the author does make an attempt to be clear, I think sometimes he talks himself around the direct point. This book ends up being confusing and long winded at times. Object-Oriented Data Structures Using Java, is a much more clear and concise book on the same subject."
2,Well it has platypi,While the book does cover several basic concepts it does not spend enought time on algorithms. Many of the code examples contain error and are poorly written. If you need a datastructures/algorithms book you would be much better off with algorithms in c++ by sedgewick.
4,Almost perfect,"This is a really cute item, especially if you are a Nightmare Before Christmas fan. I will be hanging it on my tree this year.The only thing I didn't like about it was Sally's expression - its not very true to the original movie, but its cute nonetheless."
4,"Peruvian Andes, Ph. Beaud","The book gives accurate information concerning select climbs of the Peruvian Andes in three languages (French, english and spanish) from the standard trade routes to classical more demanding routes (such as the route by J.Bouchard and also gives a very good description of the 5400ft high North Face of Huascaran Norte, Paragot Route). Too bad my previous copy was stolen by a french group in Huarez."
3,a usable mouse,"I got this mouse to replace my sony one that lights up blue and red, but aside from the light factor the Adesso mouse really sucks. My old sony mouse worked on my desk without a mouse pad, but for the Adesso the cursor will slide across the computer screen on it's own if there is no mousepad under it on the table. It sometimes moves on it's own even with a mousepad. The cursor also seems to be a lot less accurate.It is still a usable mouse, but now my desk is cluttered with a mouse pad(which came with the mouse) and a ghostly cursor that sometimes has a mind of it's own."
2,Not very good mouse,I got 3 of these for users that don't like the original Apple mice. They all three gave them back and asked for their Apple mice. The buttons do not work well. You have to click multiple times before they catch and the feel of the buttons is strange. One of them didn't even work correctly. I do like the blue glow that they have.
4,White Mouse,"Its a great product, but the only downside is that it stays lit up even when your computer is in sleep mode. So I usually just unplug it, as I do not turn my computer off."
2,Scary to Use,"I bought this mouse because I love that 'blue ice' color. However, there were several things that worried me about it. This mouse is unlike other mise in that it is flat, rather than when rounded on the top. That took some getting used to, but the thing that bothers me most about it is the usb cable. It seemed really cheap and weak, and I was always afraid to use it for fear that small cable would pull right out of the mouse. Sadly to say, I don't think this mouse would hold up if one was to use it day after day. It seems flimsy and cheap. It is comfortable to use, if you can get over that nagging feeling that it may break on you at any second. The buttons catch as well, so you sometimes have to get tough with them."
2,"beware, there's a defective track. Amazon knows but continues selling it","in the Concerto in D major, RV 94, the 2nd track has a loud squeak noise at 0'08'' (in the mp3 - I don't know about the CD). I informed Amazon of this at the end of June 2011. They confirmed that the problem exists, but didn't fix it nor compensate me. Naturally, due to this problematic track I cannot enjoy listening the whole concerto.be warned!"
5,"Many years ago, I loaned my copy of this to a friend.","This was a college textbook, and a friend wanted to borrow it. Big mistake, as I never got it back. I have often wished I could find another copy, and finally I did. It makes the Bible easier to read - poetry is written as poetry, history as history, quotes are in quote marks, etc. I am so happy to have gotten a new copy. Service was extremely fast, and although it was a former library book, it was in excellent condition."
1,I'd rather listen to cats making love,"This CD sounds like a great idea- all that fun beach party music everyone seems to love. Then you pop in the CD. You listen to Kokomo, and hear that *gasp* IT ISN'T THE BEACH BOYS. These guys covering the song can't even do a simple harmony right as the bass line goes tenor on the word ""bahama"" in the chorus. Suddenly the atmosphere at the party takes a nose dive as the singers on the disc are attempting renditions of the songs instead of the REAL thing you were expecting. Daquiries are dropping and margaritas are getting mauled as people are racing to get away from the speakers.If you want beach party music, grab a Jimmy Buffet CD and encourage everyone to sing along like at the concerts- LOUD and way off key. It's a lot more fun, and still sounds better than Drew's (in)famous music."
1,Music not by the original artists,"I was disappointed by this selection. I wanted the original recordings - not ""covers"". I would not recommend this selection to anyone!"
1,This CD is terrible,"This CD is terrible. Even if you were not concerned about the fact that these are not done by the original artists, the musicianship is just bad. The music sounds tinny and synthesized, and the vocals are off. Don't buy any of ""Drew's"" CD's--the entire series sounds like this."
3,Fooled.,"My kids love this CD! We listen to in the van all the time. I have to admit though, I didn't know the songs weren't performed by the original artists until my wife asked me who did the original recording of Wipe Out. The renditions on this CD are VERY close to the originals. The artists do a good job with their imitations (they had me fooled). However, I did notice that the ""Hawaii Five-O"" theme song sounded a little ""tinny"". Now that I know these are NOT the original recordings, I am a little miffed. Nowhere on the cover does it state this tidbit of information. I wouldn't have bought the CD if I'd known."
4,Actually Rather Good...,"I know I am ""bucking the trend"" but I throw a LUAU party every summer and I use this CD as part of my music collection. Everyone really likes it - some ask me to make a copy of the music for them. The songs are very well done in my opinion (not horrible like some of the others said). The originals are better I am sure, but this is an awesome collection ON ONE CD (if you are not able to burn your own with orignial artists). I was really surprised to see the bad reviews. I think they got ticked because they were EXPECTING the real artists. Now I would have been upset if I had that impression going in, but I already KNEW... took a chance - again, people at my party love it - and for the most part people don't notice it's not the original artists. That's my 2-cents (to balance the scale)."
5,Cathe rocks! One of her best workouts ever!,"Cathe's Cross train express is short, and gets the job done in record time. It has a 30 minute aerobic section in the front that is composed of either kickboxing, step, hi-lo, or a combination of all three. That is followed by a 10 to 15 minute section with weights focusing on a particular body part for the day, such as shoulders, biceps, back, etc. Four of the six workouts also include ab work at the end, which is challenging (planks anyone? ). There is also a separate ab workout that combines all the previous ab segments into one. The leg workout is one of the best leg workouts I have ever done, and the only workout that does not include an aerobic section (but it will leave you breathing heavy) and has a challenging ab section. This workout is expensive, but is very efficient and gets the job done. I highly recommend it."
3,Wish It Contained More Entries,"I've used a hard-copy of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations for years as a reference. I was disappointed that this current edition for the Kindle does not have all the content of the book.Abraham Lincoln, for example, is missing. Sir Winston Spencer Churchill... missing. Grover Cleveland, Christopher Columbus, Confucius; all missing. I would be a much happier Customer if this were a full-reference version."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"Read the review from WaltC ""WaltC from Abq""! He's right! The book you will download from this page to your Kindle is NOT THE BOOK ADVERTISED on this page! BUYER BEWARE! I don't know what edition of Bartlett's this is, but it is obviously not the 17th. This edition contains NO quotations from moderns such as JFK or ReaganThis review refers to the Kindle Edition, ASIN: B00164WDPE only."
1,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY this book. IT has no usable table of contents. It is not searchable. It is 1400+ pages of quotations to be accessed serially. It does not constitute a saleable product for the Kindle. Disappointed in Amazon.
2,Seriously....I have to look through how many pages to find that quote?,"When I was a young lad, I liked to read the copy of Bartlets Quotes that my mother gave me. I would search through the various tables of contents for subject or author, and have a ball. I was a bit of a nerd, but so be it. I was still fun at parties! Then I go and buy this for my iPod while I am underway, and what do I find but over 3000 pages without any way of finding a quote based on, well, anything! How do I find inspirational quotes on leadership? I read all 3000+ pages, of course! This is pretty weak and a paltry attempt of Kimblizing a book, since this is one that is driven by it's table of contents! Fix it, and give the updated version with the table to those who bought this for free."
1,Kindle Buyers: get a sample first - Buyer beware!,"This isn't, as it's currently described, the 1488 page, 17th edition, Justin Kaplan edited version of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. I'd be absolutely thrilled if it were, but it's not even close. In it's current form, it's not even worth the $4-ish price tag.Someone goofed."
1,bartletts quotations,"not only is it impossible to go to actual authors,,,the cursor would not ""highlight"" the author thereby I have no access to any quotations.Amazon better get their kindle act together,,this is the second book in three days that in this case does not even work.outrageous ,,I am furious"
5,Very Nice Quality Earrings,We purchased these earrings as a gift and were really happy with the quality. We also liked the size--not too big and not too small.
4,Bunji's Revelation,"Bunji is one of the best soca stars in the business, He creates a unique blend of reaggae and soca, All of the tracks tell a story. I approve of this album go get it."
3,Good price,Bought this for a co-worker for Christmas. I understand that the product was used but I wish they wouldn't put bright orange used stickers on the front of the product!
1,Buy this if you enjoy low class humor.,The lyrics in many of the songs were more disgusting than entertaining. The copy I purchased ended up in the fire.
4,Awesome book!,"This book was a blessing to me, just the way it compares the disciples that followed Christ to us today.. Very recommended book for discipleship leaders/ small group leaders."
2,Deceptive picture,"While a very good quality router bit, it is totally disimilar to the picture. The bit that came cuts a full 1"" deep. I needed the one as pictured, which looks like one you'd use for hinge mortising, and as you can see, it is not the same."
2,Superficial; only good for the exercises,"This book does not really teach Linear Algebra. It's very superficial and not interesting. Try Jim Hefferon's book instead and you will have a clear text that teaches Linear Algebra for real.Anyway, there are several exercises in the book -- that is one reason to buy it, I think..."
4,Life Jacket for Linear Algebra,This is a great product that I was able to get a wonderful price.I couldn't have passed the course without it. Thanks a lot! Very timely shipping.
5,What a great help...,I found the book to be a great asset in getting re-acquainted with Linear Algebra and vector calculus basics. Lots of example problems with solutions and some to work on your own.
3,"easy to learn with this book, but too many mistakes","i'm currently taking linear algebra from one of the authors of this book. the first day of class the instructor passed out a corrections sheet for the book. even with the corrections sheet, i found many wrong answers in the answer sections.the pros- low cost compared to a normal textbook- easy to understand explanations- concise- lots of problemsthe cons- many, many wrong answers in the answer key means that you'll spend a lot of time checking your math with a calculator."
2,ERRORS,"After reading the first chapter I found 6 errors within the first 14 pages. These are simple equation errors. For example, page 6, the distance equation has a1-b1 and it should be an-bn. These Phd's should have had a student(may be several) review their work for the simple errors."
1,Two many typos and mistakes,The publisher would better republish it. I find hundreds of mistakes in the book.
3,woodworker,"I think the product is a good piece of machinery , but for our buisness , it is not heavy enough. I would need an industrial planer molder. If you make a heavier one, let me know. I like Grizzly products."
1,"It's not butter, it's margarine","The ingredients list on the package says margarine, as in trans hydrogenated fat. So not like the ingredients listed on Amazon (lists butter)and not like the traditional stroopwafeln - health reasons aside, they taste so much better with butter! I'm assuming this is true for all the stroopwafeln (Stroopie)shipped by this company - there seem to be several different sizes. To their credit though, they are going to look for real butter stroopwafeln to stock, and send me some for no charge. I'll let you know how it goes!"
1,Not as advertised,"I love Stroopwafels and have tried all sorts. The kind that come from this shipper are Stroopie stroopwafels (a nice brand), but instead of the 40 count advertised, only 8 arrived (in a fancy blue tin, for which I have no need). The tin even has a sticker on top that says 40 count. Either someone is embezzling stroopwafels, or this is just misleadingly advertised. So BE AWARE! This should read 8 count, not 40 (which makes the price point pretty different!!!)"
3,"Selection of newer, lesser Beetle","Beetle Bailey as a strip has shown a hardening of the arteries over the years, as evidenced by this selection of strips from the 1980s. It is not nearly as consistently funny as classic Beetle fron the 60s and 70s, which were the strip's best decades. Still, there are sill enough good strips to make it worth owning for the ardent fan."
3,Dosen't know left from right,"I just bought the book and I am on chapter 3. I have already encountered numerous times when the author says,""the object to the left"" when it is actually to the right, or visa versa. He also doesn't know how to count. He will say,""select the two objects"" when there is actually three that he instructed you to draw. The book does teach you a lot about VIZ, but his mistakes will make it frustrating at times."
3,Left From Right...,"I'm about 1/2 way through the book, and it's an effective learning tool so far, BUT the author often doesn't know his left from his right. Over and over again he makes this glaring mistake, and leaves out steps that he clearly doesn't mean to leave out. The first few times I was willing to overlook it, but some of these omissions are costing me 20-30 minutes at a time, because I have to back up several pages and start from the point of his mistake. I can give specific examples, if anyone wants."
1,Propaganda,"The whole book looks like it is as set of anti-semitic/anti Israel articles from Soviet Union official paper ""Pravda""(Truth ::) ) of dark Brezhnev period. Usual mix: 5% truth, 85% lies/misinterpretation, 10% cheap literature. Very bad."
2,Backlighted display is dimly lit & uneven,"I have to say that I'm disappointed in this product. In the picture the display looks nice & evenly lit by the backlight. I discovered that in reality, the backlight is quite dim, regardless of the setting on the Light detector switch. I was expecting it to light up similar to a cell phone display, but it does NOT! I called the customer service number at Hideki (the company that actually makes the device). I was told that this is normal, & not to expect the display to be evenly lit. The projection function works fine. I think the inside temperature reads a little high. ANTonline will not allow me to return it for full credit. I'd have to give them a 15% restocking fee, PLUS pay shipping to return it. I guess I'm stuck with it."
4,Good unit!,"We like the unit, works well, display is bright enough even in the morning light to see, much better than some. Only complaint is that the projection system is difficult to rotate and sometimes does not stay where you put it, plus on the outside and inside projection the display does not tell you which is which, so unless it winter you don't know which is in and which is out!"
4,nice features,nice features. the projection onto the wall works well.the only negative thing is the blue screen light is too dark.
3,Fancy features - missed out on basics,"This clock is pretty cool. The remote temp transmitter works well, as does the projector. It seems to sync up OK with the atomic clock. The weather forecasting feature is useless - probably less accurate than a coin flip - but what do you expect? Very easy to use, considering all the features.On the down side, there's no volume or tone control for the alarm beeper - so hope you like the preset. Also, as another reviewer noted, the alarm goes off every week night at midnight, even though its set for 7AM (also goes off at 7AM). The blue backlight is nice, but too bright - lights up the room enough to do shadow puppets!UPDATE: Followed another reviewer's method to fix 12AM alarm issue - now alarm doesn't work at all."
4,"Does what it says it'll do, and well","Set-up was a snap; it connected to the remote and to the time-server station very quickly. It seems accurate.The projector is very configurable - focus, rotation and even a 'flip' mode in case there's a mirror in your equation. I saw a review here that complained that the projector wasn't bright enough, but it seems bright enough for me.I'd of given it five stars if it weren't sorta ugly."
1,Problems with the alarm function,"When ever you set either one of the dual alarms (weekday or single) to wake you up in the morning, it goes off twice, once at midnight and then again for the time you have set. I have sent the clock back to the manufacturer (which is not Honeywell) and they agreed the clock has a ""false"" alarm at midnight and sent me another, that clock had the same problem so they sent me another and that clock had the same problem. The manufacturer denied that they have a manufacturing/design problem. They claimed they could not refund my money so they sent me at weather station/alarm clock. It's single alarm fails to go off at all. Very poor testing/quality."
4,Good Resource for ideas on Sensory Integration,"I have found this book handy for coming up with new ideas for a ""sensory diet"" for my son. Most of the materials are easy to find if you don't already have them around the home. I recommend it for parents who are their child's primary ""therapist."" Does not replace a good occupational therapist, but I consult with one and once I learned about my son's sensory profile, we picked some activities together that would be helpful."
4,From an OT's perspective,This book is a nice activity based book for parents who are needing suggestions for home or teachers who are needing classroom activities. I like the way that it gives a simple implementation idea and then expands upon that activity to incorporate more skills. A very nice parent and teacher resource. Very practical.
1,Overpriced and VERY cheap quality,When this thing arrived I started laughing...literally. For $[...] I couldn't believe what showed up. The orange flag part wasn't even affixed to the pole and flew off on the first and only time we were able to use it. I went down to a local hardware/catch all store and paid $2.99 for a flag that is 10 times better than this one. Don't buy it!!
1,Be afraid. Be very afraid.,"People, stay away from this game. The senseless killings and bad language give gaming a bad name. The story is minuscule and convoluted, the graphics way, way below par and you play through it in four hours. If you like gangsta rap, maybe the soundtrack would be nice, but you get many more for 30 bucks on iTunes or in a record store. Don't waste precious life time on this game like I did."
2,PARENTS!!!!!,"Game is OK, but I'm really here to say, if parents were paying attention to their children, and NOT BUYING ADULT GAMES FOR THEM!!this wouldnt be an issue. Stop being parents to the whole nation and keep an eye on your own kids, thats why we have a rating system for movies and GAMES. Can't stop your kids from playing a game, thats your problem, not the game makers, sounds like you should re-think your parenting position to me. Can't stop the games.. HA! HA! HA!"
3,GTA Clone has its ups but several key downs,"25 to Life is a controversial game, but so is GTA, Hitman, and dozens of other violent games. Keep this one away from your kids and try not to dictate to the world how everybody should ban the game. This is America so deal with it, folks.On a gameplay level, the game is fun but on my Dell 8250 with 1 GB RAM and 256 MB nVidia 6800 GT, there are some slowdowns in framerates. As I found out from another site, Eidos just didn't design the game to flow smoothly when multiple enemies are on the screen. The controls are fairly easy to manipulate, but sometimes you get shot even when you can't see an enemy when peering around a corner. The game has a decent length with 10 stages, but could be longer. There aren't any vehicles to drive, just a straight-up run 'n gun with some hiding behind cover.The game is worth a try, but only under $15 in my mind. EBay it up."
4,The Weather Channel....,"would have no ""now, the local weather forecast"" music without Fattburger (and Spyro Gyra). This group never deviates from its reliable formula of Evan Marks' guitar shining on a few tracks (that he presumedly wrote) then dragging through several average collaborative efforts with Hollis Gentry showing up unannounced like he's still trying out for the band (he's not yet listed as an official member). Sizzlin is a very strong opening number and stretches out at the end into a faux-hammond groove. Stay A Little Longer the next track is a nice R/B flavored track built around Hollis' soprano. You're Finally Here is a tasty ensenble number with a little flugel horn slipped in for texture. Then that inevitable dragging thing sets in until Mr C the final track which is the band cutting loose 70's Crusader ""Scratch"" style-this time with a real Hammond. Sizzlin has enough substance to satisfy and meets expectations of Fattburger affectionados."
4,Sizzlin' Cooks,"Sizzlin cooks with a delicious dose of smooth jazz grooves to delight every Fattburger fan. Standouts are the catchy cuts Sizzlin', You're Finally Here, The Lizard and Bleu Cheese. You know with Fattburger there's lots to digest in their masterful CDs. Two points: why is the group using the same cover photo from 2001's www.fattburger.com cd? They must have other photos or maybe they're camera shy! Second, no Santana covers. Fattburger would really sizzle doing a Santana tribute CD. What about it guys?"
4,Amazing Israeli Music,"I am not Israeli, or Jewish, but this CD is great. The obvious talent shines through meaning the language barrier is not that big, because the music and the quality and range of the voice makes up for the lack of understanding, although I have begun to learn a little Hebrew. Well worth the money, compared to the awful manufactured trash that pollutes most Western charts like the never-ending cesspits of non-talent that they really are."
3,"Fun! But not for those who are offended by ""language""","Definitely a fun read, but the dirty language..... oh please..... Who talks like that to their parents and siblings? On the other hand, it's zany, fast-paced with a nicely-predictable ending."
4,Funny good read,"Considerably better than aerage for the genre but not her best.Basicaly boy meets girl, boy hates girl, boy gets girl and happly ever after. What makes this book stand out are a number of hallirous scenes well writen characters and some good errotica."
4,The Royal Pain,I actually enjoyed all three of these books (The Royal Pain is the 2nd). This was my second favorite out of the series and really did enjoy reading about the Alaskan Royal family. These are light hearted silly books with no nail biting drama. They are an easy read but seriously laugh out loud funny.
3,Lighthearted fun but poor character development,"Mary Janice Davidson adds another book to her growing collection of light-hearted offerings. A follow-up to The Royal Treatment, this book only does a passable job in character and plot development. Though it has some humorous moments, it does not come close to capturing Davidson's talent for writing witty, funny characters (e.g. Betsy and Sinclair from her Undead series). Davidson has a secondary romance running throughout this book which turns out to be more fun than the primary characters'. However, two storylines in one short book means that there are gaps in the author's ability to make the connections believable as she jumps from character to character. That said, this is a good book for a lazy day when you just want to enjoy a light-hearted romp."
3,Enjoyable read but flawed in historical details & perspective,"I really enjoyed the read of the memoirs of Belton Cooper. It was rather like sitting on your uncles lap and hearing war stories of the great World War Two...but I have to agree with reviewer R. A Forczyk whose 1 star review here, explains in detail the bias, the errors and such in the memoirs. However, I consider the book the memoirs of an old WWII soldier who did his duty, and I enjoyed the read, even if some of it is false, slanted, or borrowed from other sources long after the war was over. Having known a couple of WWII tankers myself, I can say they were a brave lot, and memoirs of this tank maintenance battalion Lt. reveal a bit of what it was like in western Europe between D-day and the fall of Berlin. See the one star review of Mr. Forczyk for a detail listing of errors and bias in this book."
3,This is NOT a book about the Sherman Tank,"While the book was OK for some light reading, it was not written by a Tanker but a liason maint. officer who worked on them. I expected to read alot about crewmen's experiences, especially dueling with the more powerful German Tanks. This was more of one man's exploits running through the woods in a jeep. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED."
4,"Hoping for more tank-specific stuff, but still a great book!","It's a great book with a particular focus on where wars are really won or lost: logistics. I have to admit that I was hoping for more tank-on-tank details, but mr. cooper writes what he knows, which would be resupply, repair and division-level movements.It's hard to read the book without getting a little angry at the army for training too few tankers and overestimating the effectiveness of the M4 in the face of superior German armor. It is an excellent companion to Steven Ambrose's Citizen Soldier."
4,Death Traps--American Tanks in World War II,"Well written and researched book, and easy to read. A study of American tanks in the Eastern Theater of Operations from 1944 through 1945. A must for wargamers. Of interest to other historians, and antiquarians."
5,Amazing,"This book is an amazing eye-witness account from a US Third Army officer, responsible for tank recovery and repair from the Normandy coast to Berlin. The best thing about this book is the level of details regarding equipment, weaponry, logistics and individuals, which gives you a very good insight into the life as a tank grunt in one of the most devastating encounters for the US army during WWII. You can learn a lot from this book, written by a guy who had the unfortunate task of recording the devasting effect German panzer had on the US Sherman tin cans! And it is a great tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of the US Third army."
1,Bad writing and editing,"Mr. Cooper shows his old age in writing these ""memoirs."" Repetitious and annoying statements by the author makes you skip around the book for more lucid commentary, but to no avail. There have got to be better books out there about the Sherman tank in WWII battles. Get this book from a library or garage sale."
5,Great guitar work,"Besides her extraordinary voice, Vanessa has the backing of Kevin Eubanks, formerly of the Jay Leno Show, and OscarCastro-Neves as guitar backgrounds. Listen to them both on ""It's Probably Me"".Vanessa is at her best on ""Being Green"", the muppet song."
3,symbolism throughout,"I read this book for my college class and found it extremely interesting with a lot of symbolism throughout. There was a lot of intense imagery used by Hemingway such as the darkness of the night outside. As well, the old man's deafness is also a powerful image used in the story. Deafness shuts the old man out from the rest of the world. In the day, everything must be a reminder to him of his disconnection from the world. The busy streets, the marketplace, the chatter in the cafes along the street, the animals, and the motor vehicles fill the town with noise all day long. There are also imagery about nothing or ""nada"" which the old man was suffreing. Overall, this story is incredibly deep and was a bit hard to understand."
5,Hemingway at his finest,"Hemingway's finest short story, and arguably the most sardonic and ironical shory story EVER written. Offers valuable insights into the human condition. Though only a couple thousand words long, has elements of Hemingway writing that appear in all his major works. Read it a couple of times to let it really sink in, and understand that nada y nada is Hemingway code for life is nothing."
1,Bad cover versions. Two thumbs down.,"Misleading, false advertising and bad soundalike recordings. I want my money back."
2,Not the original artists.,The sound quality is fine but unless you read the small print on the back of the CD you won't realize that the artists singing your favorite hits aren't the original artists.
1,"Should be less than 1 star, but it doesn't go that low.","Wow, I've never seen such awful trash in my entire life. Every other word is a senseless vulgarity. No plot, just pointless sexual scenarios. I have a friend who works in a bookstore near where Mr. Livingstone lives, and they've sold 2 copies of the book--and both were returned. Don't waste your time with this overly erotic wasteland. If you want to read something that's actually respectable and Baltimore-related, read Baltimore Blues by Laura Lippman. She makes Baltimoreans proud to be associated with the city, whereas Livingstone's book just makes us want to move to Detroit. Save yourself the embarrassment and the money"
1,Gutter Trash,This work is a sleazy portrait of Baltimore. I have met the author and he is as sleazy as his book. I know of a store in Baltimore that cannot even give the book away for free. I have seen better books about Baltimore than this. A disgrace to the city.
2,I wouldn't advise . . . has recovery issues,"I purchased this laptop, and it's all well and good. The issue I have with this laptop is the way the hard drive is partitioned, and the poor recovery disk setup. The recovery disk does not have the bundled software that the laptop comes with, so, if anything happens to the hard drive, and you have to do a full restore, you would most likely lose the programs. In addition, a full restore would NOT restore the device drivers, unfortunately, as I have painfully experienced. I bought two of these, and have had cause to contact gateway for a CD that would be more helpful. Performance-wise though, it is a good system. This is my third Gateway laptop using the same form factor, and the monitor hinge is rather weak, and I have experienced serious cracking with my first one."
3,My Colouring Book,"Not Agnetha Faltskog's best performance. Disappointed in the instrumental arrangements. If you are an Agnetha fan, buy the CD."
3,A Lovely voice,I bought 10 ar before this and the score I give is relative to that. I think mainly because the some of songs chosen were not suited to Agnetha as well as those in other compilations. I still rate her and don't regret buying CD. I wish someone like Barry Gibbs would craft some songs for her. That would be worth waiting for.
2,BIg Agnetha Fan - Big Disappointment,"I have been a big fan of Agnetha's voice and couldn't wait to hear from her again with this latest CD. I thought that even if it wasn't as good as her ABBA and post-ABBA work, still it would be worth owning, just because it was Agnetha. Well, I'm sorry to say that I would not recommend you spend any money for this CD as it was a huge disappointment. There is no energy in her voice, no passion, and no variety of color. Ironic that it is called ""... Colouring Book..."" because her performance is mostly monochromatic, vocally. If you're a fan, you can interpret this inferior production in many ways, whether it is a factor of her age, her odd personal life, her state of mind, whatever. But the bottom line is simply that it is not very good compared to all of her earlier work, and as such it is overpriced."
2,Agnetha - My Colouring Book,"I am a huge fan of Agnetha's from the ABBA period. My Colouring Book was her first album in 17 years. She became a recluse on her island and was labeled ""the new Garbo"" by the Swedish press. Agnetha still has her voice, but I take exception to her song selection here. All she did was go back and record things she was doing with a dance band in the 1960s, before ABBA. I have listened to this album one time and have no desire to hear it again."
1,So Sad,"I find it so sad that such a great talent and voice goes into a studio and allows such a bland album to be made in her name. The album is a great dissapointment, the arrangements are harsh and amateur to say the least, the voice is the only shining light on this album, but even that cannot make up for a weak set of songs.Sorry Agnetha but if this is the best you can do, leave us with the great memories of earlier works.If you do another album give George Michaels or Rod Stewarts producer a call your talents deserve their ability at the very least."
5,Sensational,"This is unlike most covers albums, in that it's obviously been intiated and carefully nurtured by Agnetha with no regard for commercial potential; as she herself said, she just decided to sing again after many years of silence. And wow, was it worth the wait! The sense of passion and commitment to the project is evident right the way through this album - this is unlike anything Agnetha has previously attempted and is streets ahead of her other solo work. I can only say buy it! buy it! buy it! And try to get the singles with dance mixes - it's like ABBA reborn for the 21st century!"
5,"Well Done Agnetha, It Was Great, March 31, 2005,","Trevine Bastians from Sri LankaAgnetha may have been away for 17 years, but her singing abilities are still awesome, and her interpretive skills impressive. I am glad she didn't feel the need to make a campy disco comeback, and has recorded these mature interpretations in her own style.Some of the vocal performances sound safe and there are some times when I wish Agnetha would just let herself go a little more, but it is stll a great album."
5,It was worth the wait!,"After 17 years it was well worth the wait. Agentha never sounded better. Most of the selections were unknown to me, but form what seems like a never ending sound track. The title track ""My Colouring Book"" begins where the last track ""What Now My Love"" leaves off. I have a hard time picking a favorite as this album just may end up a Greatest Hits package as every song has the potential of being a single. It has been a long time since we have heard this angles voice, but like a fine wine, it gets better with time!"
3,Queen of Hearts is back in town,"... Queen of Hearts still wears the crown. A line from a lost track that Agnetha recorded in 1979, and was remastered and included on her ""That's Me - Greatest Hits"" CD in 1989.But does she still wear the crown with this new CD? Being an absolute Agnetha fan I was expecting better than what this album offers. It's a mixed bag really. Some fine re-workings of Agnetha's favourite all-time songs, but some bad re-workings too. I'm thinking of ""When You Walk in the Room"" which is very robotic sounding, and ""Sealed with a Kiss"" where she sounds bland.The main highlights for me are ""If I Ever Thought You'd change your mind"" and ""What now my Love"". I think she could release anything and people would give her 5 stars simply because she's Anna from ABBA, and they do it out of loyalty. However, for me this album isn't brilliant ... its just ok."
4,"Welcome back, and, let's hope there's another...","When you're in the mood for some golden oldies sung with one of the best voices ever, this album is on the short list. Agnetha remains an extraordinary singer.The narrative of Agnetha Faltsog's life is such a bittersweet story. Not as sad as, say, a Judy Garland or Greta Garbo. Maybe she just wanted to be a singer but it became to unsafe or too complicated (phobias, etc.) after ABBA. Maybe the world became too unsafe, remembering the violence in Europe in the 80's. Maybe she just wanted to raise Linda and Christian in a somewhat normal world.It's such a delight to hear her voice find its wings like some phoenix, flying out the ashes of 17 years of unrequitied love, which seems to be the theme of this album.Put on the best headphones you have, and savor ""Fly Me to the Moon.""I hope, after four years (June '08), this is not her last effort. I'd enjoy another serving of pop clasics -- maybe some duets with Phil Collins."
5,Christmas gift for my nephew,"My 3 year old nephew loves to watch the Jim Carrey Grinch movie. While watching the scene when the Grinch is a baby, he said that he wanted a baby grinch, so that he could pat his head, which we all thought was hilarious. This was the closest thing I could find to a baby grinch, and although it doesn't look like the baby in the movie, he loves it and cuddles it and holds it like a baby. Perfect size for a 3 year old!"
4,good value,"While these are far from the best bits I have used they do work great for general drilling and save me time (instead of re-sharpening them, I just throw them away, yes I know I'm lazy). The case is above average for a cheap bit set and it includes multiple small bits, just in case they break."
4,"""Nice New, Nice Blue, Nice New Blue Shoes""","This is one of those books that kids will love because of how fun it is to read out loud. It's also delightful because the little girl, Rebecca, is just like so many little girls. I recommend this book to read out loud with you child."
4,Do not use on Mac OS X,"The game works fine on our Windows machine. It keeps my 4 year old interested. But the game does not run well in the ""Classic"" mode when using OS 10.3 (panther)."
4,Good...but...,"My 5 year old daughter is enjoying this package, BUT...be aware that on Windows XP and Windows 2000 that the program has to be installed AND run as a user with administrative rights. Not exactly the kind of account I would choose to setup for a small child.Unfortunately the information isn't included in the packaging, so you might waste time reinstalling or checking compatiblity settings before finding the info on the support web site (http://support.scholastic.com/Solution.asp?sid=204642041122066189015104&pid;=782&pnm;=Clifford+Reading&tnf;=15&seid;=1932&pos;=Windows+XP&top;=Error+Messages&rid;=12622)"
3,Clifford Reading,"Clifford Reading does not have a lot of activities as compared with Clifford Phonics. My daughter hates this cd but always asks for Clifford Phonics instead. The Bleakman cleanup activity was upsetting to her because in her words ""they were mean and angry"" and I do agree. I wish they could have kept the tone in that game nice and reinforcing. I would not recommend this cd if you have a child sensitive to disapproving/angry tones. However she loves Clifford Phonics!"
1,This does not work on a MAC at all!,"Don't buy this if you have a Mac. You need to have an operating system that hasn't been sold in 5 years to be able to view this. You need classic OS 9. And I don't even know if that'll really work because I don't know anyone who has a system that old to try it on! If you don't have a PC, don't waste your time. It is very disappointing that it is falsely advertised as working on a MAC OS 10x-but look on the package and they add the word ""classic"". I don't remember seeing that word on Amazon. In fact, the PC operating systems are clearly outlined on the amazon listing, but not the mac operating systems! Amazon-you need to fix this omission on all Mac products. If I could I would give this zero stars--to the company that produced this disc for not upgrading it, and to Amazon for not outlining the operating systems it runs on on a MAC clearly."
1,Wrong Version,"Thought we wanted the old version but this was one too old, didn't get to try it and gave it to the library."
4,Enjoyable collection of short stories,"A collection of magazine stories that are well written and enjoyable to read. My favorite was the one about the mountain lion trapper, a western story with unusual characters and story lines."
1,Never got it,"I ordered it on my Kindle. and never rec'd it.... so no, I did not hate it, but you do not have a category for"" I never got it"""
2,Louis L'Amour's West of the Tularosa,I really like western stories and I think Louis L'Amour is a great writer of western stories but this book is a series of short stories that are kind of boring to me. The stories are really short and I don't think you can really cover much of a story that way.
3,o.k.,"I'm not too fond of a collection of short stories, although I like the author and western stories. Short stories plots all run together, and have a similar expected ending."
5,Jimd,Great book. Lots of good stories from one of the best western authors . I've read all of his books except a few of his short storiesGave it five stars.
4,RVL200 supports both IPSec and SSL VPN,"I just bought a RVL200 and completed deployment.It supports both IPSec and SSL VPN, and several authentication types for SSL user management. I use the existing Active Directory Server for user management with easy configuration, and my colleagues in branch office, work at home and outside mobile sales people can access network resource and their desktop just like they are at office.You could buy one and give it a try."
2,Gets disconnected from Lan,"This device is easy to configure and you can get SSL VPN up and running real fast. The problem was that it would become unreachable from both the internet side and intranet side after 1 or 2 connects. I did not have time to send syslogs outside to see what exactly the problem was, but it definitely would not be reachable, so I returned it and I am buying the Netgear SSL VPN device: FVS336G"
2,SSL VPN has issues with Vista - -support nonexistent,"Works fine as a router, and SSL VPN client works fine with XP (note that you need admin permissions on your machine to install the virtual adaptor).Vista is another issue. Linksys recently released new firmware 1.17 which supports Vista, and I did get it to work breifly before it started doing some weird things.Trying to resolve with Linksys tech support, but I am not hopeful.Note that this product falls into a special category - you need to call for support. Make sure you say you are a business or you get shunted into the ""stay on hold forever and then get hung up on"" area.update: after No call back from Linksys, returned unit and bought a cisco 871 Cudos to Amazon for a great return policy.As for this product. I'd have to put it in The toy category based on the lack of Support."
1,The Worse Cd I have heard in a Long tine,"The New Streetwize cd was a complete waste of time. After, I heard last years cd from this group I decided to give this one a try. Please do yourself a favor and run from this cd. This cd seems to copy the formula that Hidden Beach uses with its Unwrapped series, but oh my god complete GARBAGE!! I would like to hear what the rest of you who got this cd think and see if I got a cd that had the wrong music..."
1,HORRID,"...This CD is [bad.] This is simply the worst CD I have heard in memory. I loved Missy's song ""Work It"" the title track but it is destroyed here by what sounds to be children playing with toy instruments. Did real musicians make this record?? Did adults supervise?? HORRID I TELL YOU. I will never buy a record based on a song title again. EVER. If you want to buy a copy only played one time click above for my used copy."
5,When there was a prince on a white horse,"Has anyone seen this delightful movie; Leslie Caron, Michael Wilding and this darling old English actress, Estelle Winwood; it was magical; but then, one must believe on a person showing up on a white horse and you have a matching glass slipper from the ball which you left in the middle of the night and you were a charperson for a wicked stepmother and 2 or 3 ugly stepsisters and some mice on acid."
3,A guilty pleasure,"The story-book setting and costumes are a flaming anachronism, the ballets are a bit silly...and yet, every once in a while, I do go back to it. Leslie Caron as the misunderstood stepchild is very touching, and Estelle Winwood spouting illogical-seeming knowledge and stealing everything in sight is a great cause for smiles. A Hollywood film great for kids, but doesn't totally neglect the adults either."
5,The Glass Slipper,"I LOVE this movie!!! The music, the costumes, the different personalities they gave to the old characters is great and very simply done. Leslie Caron was charming and lovely in this.I wish this was made in a DVD or someone would redo it into a DVD form, I would LOVE to buy it for my mom and older sister who love old movies like this one!!!!"
3,Light but pleasant,"This is a fun postmodern version of the Cinderella story, featuring great tongue-in-cheek humor and a bravura performance by the charming Estelle Winwood as the batty Mrs. Toquet. But Michael Wilding and Leslie Caron have very little chemistry, and the dance sequences are lackluster."
3,the first song is the one,"although none of the songs are recorded by the original artists, the songs are beautiful, especially the first one, ""I Do"" (Kiss the Bride). I am looking to find this songs sheet music, so that I can have it played in my ceremony. It is a beautiful song and is just for this special occasion. I do need the sheet music, though.?"
3,not for iBooks,"I was super excited to get this product; what a great idea! But it is too wide to fit past the sides of the computer into the USB slot on my iBook (old clamshell style). I've used other flash drives so I never thought about it not fitting. It's nice and small, a great idea, but not for clamshell iBooks or other laptops where the USB isn't flush with the computer."
5,A Must Have,"Smalll , fast , use any xD card and it's a flash drive. Download your pictures anywhere to any computer with a open usb port. You need one of these."
5,Fast and will read 1 gig card!,"I was very unsure if this would work with my 1 gig xd card but one review seemed to suggest it would. For the low price of $15 plus shipping I figured I would give it a try. When I read the compatibilties on the instructions they only showed up to 512mb, so I thought I'd lost out. But I tried it and NO PROB. Solved my dilemma. I have all the other slots on my 'puter just not for the xD my new camera uses. Now I'm set."
2,Selling good junk,"Interesting reading but I didn't find anything new in her technique of buying and selling. There were some good web sites listed as a reference otherwise consider this a light, easy read. Sorry."
5,A Great Read,This book is like comfort food to the soul. Totally enjoyed it and so encouraged by the emphasis on God as all sufficient for our needs.
2,The Beach House,"I really didn't care for this at all. I couldn.t wait until I was finished. Sorry, Ms. John, but it was not my cup of tea."
3,I enjoyed it but it is a depressing read,"As all of Sunny's diaries are, this one is depressing, and probably the most depressing of all, especially since she watches her own mother die. I feel for the girl. Poor Sunny, that is tragic. If my Mom died, I don't know what I'd do. And her father is a total jerk.I love the cover picture, that is really cool. This series inspired me to keep a journal, I have been keeping journals since I first read these books starting back in summer 1997!"
1,Totally bummed!,When I saw this item I was thrilled. My husband and son had been looking for a blind just like the one shown and described in this ad. When I ordered it though I was VERY disappointed to open the package they had shipped to me. All that I recieved was a cover for the blind and NO stand at all! I immediately called the company and let them know of the mistake. I was told that it was Amazon.com's fault and that even though I was a victim of false advertising all they could do for me was refund my money. I should have recieved what I ordered for the price that was stated. When I did recieve my refund I didnt even get shipping charges. I am very dissatisfied and wouldnt reccommend this online store to anyone.
5,Don't Miss This Lecture!,"Never mind the cello pieces on this CD...the main payoff is the Lecture on Nothing. I have owned almost every CD of Cage's work and this one endures in my mind and in my life. Treat yourself to a literal, explicit version of 4'33"" and get a copy of Lecture on Nothing. Caution: not for late night driving!"
4,Lots of good info,"This book contained a lot of great info about figuring out where you are in life, analyzing where you want to go, and actionable steps to get there. It was longer than it needed to be with a few lulls in places, but the good parts of the book were well written and full of great content."
1,How about the real rebels?,I have worked for myself for the last nine years and believe that any true rebels would and should through this book out the window.
3,Ok,This is okay...our daughter has enjoyed playing with it and pretend cooking. A little loud but tolerable.I would prefer a learning toy over this...but I'm not the 4yr old.
1,Inside battery compartment started to melt,This blender was D.O.A. My wife tried 2 sets of batteries in the blender while I was at work. When I got home I took a look at it and the bottom was very hot. I unscrewed the battery compartment to find the batteries had swelled and the battery compartment had started to melt. This toy is another fine quality Chinese product! It needs to be recalled before a child gets injured.
1,NOT worth it,Purchased this for 18 month old son who is very fascinated with our real mixer. Just like another review said after 1 minute of spinning it stopped making any noise and only the light would come on. We replaced the batteries and let it cool off (because it felt a little warm) for an hour. It worked for about 15 mins before giving out. After 2 months of replacing batteries almost every other day (and yes we tried both rechargeable and regular) it just stopped working all together. My son seems to miss it actually working because when it rotated it was nice. The pieces didn't hurt when he put his hand in the way. The colors are nice and overall size is appropriate. I wish I had spent more money on one that didn't have any reviews about it not working because it is not luck as to which mixer you get..it is the product!
1,Waste of money,It was a huge disappointment on Christmas day when new batteries were inserted and nothing happened when the mixer was turned on. We even tried a different set of batteries. Good thing Amazon is refunding 100 % plus paying for the return shipping.
4,"Works as a mixer, sounds right","My toddler likes playing with his toy kitchen, so we got him this mixer to play with too. He enjoys listening to the sound it makes, and also putting dried lentels into the bowl and watching the mixer stir them around.It does what it says, and if you're looking for a toy mixer for your kid, this is a cute one that seems relatively sturdy. Heck, you might even be able to mix real things with it!"
5,Surprisingly fun!,My two and four year olds both love this toy. It's spins fast but stops easily if a finger is placed in the mixer. A favorite in our house is to mix ice and water but there are many possible uses.
1,Broke after one use on Christmas...,"The product seems to be great. Kinda top heavy, so when you tilt the top back it falls... Still, it broke after turning it on. I tried new batteries and took it apart. It could not be fixed. Very sad!! I am contacting the company today!"
1,Never worked,"We opened up this product, put in brand new batteries and nothing worked. Even tried different batteries with the same result. The light didn't even turn on, just a complete waste of time, the same thing happened with their coffee machine, not happy!!!"
4,granddaughter loves it,We gave this to our granddaughter for her 5th birthday and she has been playing with it in her kitchen ever since. Seems durable so far (1 month).
5,Old Underoath Is Back,"This band is amazing, just like old underoath with the breakdowns and everything...can wait till the full length"
4,musicians Gear delux banjo case,Good quality. Banjo fits good. had to make a slight adjustment with an extra pad to keep the banjo from moving about in the case.
5,Perfect Fit Case,The Case arrived before the Banjo. Thus when the banjo arrived we had a place to put it. It was a perfect fit. We were pleased!
4,Decent case,"Good case, required a small bit of modification though. I had to modify this so the banjo sat lower in the case. No big deal."
2,Disappointed,"I love Elle Decor magazine, but I did not care for this book, or any of the other ones in this series for that matter. The photos are decent, but the decor in the pictures don't seem to be as good as it is in the magazine. I think that there are other books on bathrooms that would be more satisfying."
3,warning,"At a first glance it looks very well, especially for the richness of exercises. However my students have already found 2 mistakes (not merely misprints):Ex. 4.28 is completely fool: a constant of motion (momentum of a free particle) seems to evolve in time because of forgetting an 'i' in the energy exponent!the answer d) of 5.15 is simply wrong.I am not able to give a rate to the book because I have not yet read it carefully; I put 3 stars because it is compulsory to fill the field. I am writing this note just to give a warning to students: never trust books blindly, even the best ones can be plagued by mistakes.I would have preferred to make these remarks directly to the authors but I do not know their e-mail address; my suggestion is to put a link to the authors."
2,Not great,"I bought this book as I was taking undergraduate-level Quantum Mechanics. While it has a better review and analysis of bra and ket notation than, say, the Griffiths text, and has excellent applications (square well, energy levels, Landau Levels, etc.), it was practically useless until I finished the course. Additionally, as others have pointed out, the outline is riddled with errors. It is not as well-written as Murray Spiegel's Vector Analysis or Fourier Series books. If you're a graduate student or want a refresher course, I'd consider it. Otherwise, this is not the ideal choice."
5,Shaum's Outline In Quantum Mechanics an Excellent Book,"The detailed calculations and discussions of methodology in this book far exceed those presented in the typical quantum mechanics book. This book, along with the book Quantum Mechanics Demystified (these two books are a superb complement to one another and should used together), should be required accompanyments to any quantum mechanics book. While almost all quantum mechanics books give an adequate discussion of the basic Schroedinger Equation and its applications, they are usually flops insofar as matrix mechanics are concerned, especially in the case of angular momentum. These books more than makes up for that. I personally am using this book and Quantum Mechanics Demystified to review a subject that I studied more than 40 years ago and find it to be very clearly written, making it more than adequate to overcome some very substantial holes that were not covered by my previous books. The authors should be well pleased with their work."
5,Schaum's Outline of Quantum Mechanics,"Basic information, and lots of problems (many worked out, others with answers). Makes for good practice and review."
4,Great kit,The perfect kit to cover all spark plug sizes but the rubber boot inside the socket lacks. Sometimes the spark plug will pull out the rubber boot. Not a big deal but also not a flawless design. 4 stars!
2,just ok,"I was hoping for more in-depth information about Hibernate 3. The book flows ok and is easy to read, but just doesn't have the details that you can find with the general documentation. I should have previewed the book at a local store before buying it. Hibernate in Action is supposed to be the best Hibernate book, but didn't buy it because it is almost 2 years old now. Looking back, probably should have bought that to get a good foundation, then used the online docs to find the differences with ver 3."
2,Not very helpful,"This book is not very useful for professional programmers. It is brief, almost like a ""cookbook"" style book, although it doesn't have the type of self-contained, concise examples you'd find in a cookbook. Their explanations often seem incomplete, with example code sprouting inexplicable annotations that aren't discussed (or aren't well discussed) in the text.I would recommend ""Java Persistence with Hibernate"" as a more thorough and comprehensive treatment of using Hibernate."
3,Short and too much repetitive code,"The book book has 242 pages in total, where ca 30 are intro + appendix and at least 30 pages are nothing more than POJO's code with fancy getter and setter methods. I guess the author got paid on per-page basis. Conclusion: Do not waste your money!"
3,Good but thin,I could not agree more with the review submitted by Ugo Cei.This book (although helpful) was extremely high level. Hibernate In Action was a bit more thorough.
4,For Ever Mapplethorpe,"Imperdible, para todos aquellos que quieran aprender fotografia observando a los grandes maestros."
4,Good narrative discussion with good balance,"Pretty good attempt to present this low moment in American history with fairness. Not the most profound analysis, bit an good narrative."
4,Heavy on the military history,"This DVD gives a good history of the Mexican-American War, particularly focusing on the battles. It also offers the views of Mexican scholars and goes into the idea of Manifest Destiny and Polk's policies. More information on the anti-war protesters such as Henry David Thoreau would be desirable, but all in all a good product for history lovers."
3,mexican american war,does not give a full history of the conflict and the precusors to the war. Overall good though
1,A defacement of marital values and overall ethics.,An artless hallmark of a society in crisis. In my opinion this book is suitable only for the psychologist studying the evanescence of moral values and ethical standards of the American suburbia. A defacement of marital values and overall ethics.
3,confusing,"Yeah I was fooled. I only got 32. And that was with my imagination as well. I can't believe it wanted me to think.What was confusing was that I bought the book after looking at the title and not the subtitle. So I assumed it was 101 nights of grrreat sex. I was fooled you see, because I didn't read the subtitle: ""...for couples"" When I got home and saw this, thought it was limiting, but I didn't realise that it meant for a couple of people. I thought of couple of anything that included me.So before you buy this book, make sure you know that it's meant for a couple of humans, not chickens, nor chicken human couples. The book is still mildly enjoyable.Also Tony the tiger is missing."
3,Depends what you are looking for,"I bought this book because my husband and I like to play games and have fun with our sex life. We are both pretty open and don't have trouble talking to each other about what we want. In tearing out the pages, we've found most of them to be pretty tame and that we do most of the stuff in it anyway.. By taking a basic idea presented, and modifying it, we've found it works better for us. We approach the book as a game more than anything and tear pages more on a ""what flavor will it be tonight"" basis.If your sex life is average, and you are afraid to experiment (for whatever reason), or are a novice, this book could help a lot. If not, it can still be fun. You'll get out of it what you put into it, as with anything."
4,Another Valentine's Day,"I bought this book once before, but here I am with a new partner approaching Valentine's day, and I am in need of a new copy of this book since it has cards that are torn open. We have done some of the exercises before, but the book adds a little something extra to make sex fresh and exciting. This book provides great ways to add to a satisfying sex life. It's a great resource for lovers, old or new!The only drawback is that some situations presume that you have no other obligations and can set aside any amount of time for lovemaking. That's why I also recommend (and buy for my friends' wedding showers) FIVE MINUTES TO ORGASM EVERY TIME YOU MAKE LOVE. It helps women enjoy quickies just like men, even if they've previously had trouble reaching orgasm during intercourse."
5,This book changed our lives.,"Our sex life wasn't bad to begin with. We started off with all the right chemistry, but after the ""honey moon"" phase ended, we were right smack in the middle of a rut. We were too tired, too full, too drained and too overworked to put any energy into our libidos. This began to cause doubt and hurt feelings. Two subjects we had never encountered and didn't like.101 Nights of Great Sex, has 101 recipes, approximately 50 for her and 50 for him. The recipes are designed to accomplish two things, (1) fill your mate with pleasure and (2) shed your inhibitions. Because you are instructed to complete these recipes as a couple, you are simultaneously being pleasured and taking intimate risks. This will not only bring you closer today, it also lays a strong foundation for a healthy and exciting sex life, for all the days that you live. Once you embark on this journey, you will never go back to mundane, routine and boring eroticism."
4,The anticipation to open another page is great.,"My wife and I bought this book to add spice to our already great sex life, and without sounding negative, some of the pages are not very practical. Some of the things in the book require an extreme imagination and a nice size wallet. If you really use your mind you can improvise and make some small adjustments to get the satisfaction you are looking for. I have to admit a lot of the things in the book are fun, but without giving away what's in the book, we did one thing that required a bathtub, and having our baby's bath toys in the tub, I accidently sat on the Winnie the Pooh toy and I know that was not in the book as one of the props. What an adventure that was, but the bottom line is the book is worth every dollar, and just use your imagination."
2,"Not great, but some fun stuff","My husband and I bought this book with an open mind and were really anxious to try new things. However, we both found ourselves thinking ""this is really stupid"" when reading many of the suggestions. Unfortunately, most of the great suggestions were the ones that cost an arm and a leg, and would require us to get rid of the kids for at least a night. This book would be great for a couple with no kids and a lot of money, but for us, it was a little rediculous. We were able to salvage some good ideas by modifying what was there. Nice try, but no cigar!"
5,"spicy, but not scary!","Laura's books present ideas in ways that help spice up your romance, but they aren't inaccessible or scary. Best of all, her ideas help you start thinking of your own versions of seductions because the important thing is to create the mystery and take time for your partner! It's a gift that keeps on giving!"
2,Not great,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. Many of the suggestions were so expensive & required several hours of setup. Some of the tips & techniques were good, but there just weren't enough of them. My partner and I found ourselves skipping ahead to the pages with tips & techniques, because they were more interesting & fun. Not everybody has the money to spend that so many of the scenarios required though!"
2,Corny and costly,"I bought this book thinking that the information in it was going to be so fabulous that they hid it in the tear out pages. When I started reading it I was expecting more real advice on relaxing, relating and pleasing one another. It's not there. For anyone in their late 30's+, this book will remind you of the show from the 70's ""Love American Style."" The plus side of this book is that, because we made the effort to buy this book and get comfortable looking at it together, it was easy then to toss it on the floor and really really talk about how to please each other."
3,"Interesting, but a little chintzy","Some of the suggestions are good, but some were just too much and took too much planning. You must really be commited to following through and put some time and effort into it otherwise save your money for a movie night."
4,101 Nights of Grrreat Sex,"This book took ages to find having read about it a couple of years back. Was it worth the wait? Yes. It's an ingenious way to have fun with your partner, to do things together. There are 50 things to surprise the woman, 50 things to surprise the man. The fun is in the excitement of what surprise is in store for you. It helps to overcome inhibitions too."
4,Fun Book,"We thought this was a fun book. It gives you ideas to do when you get bored with the usual stuff. Some of the pages are boring, but others are really good. And it give you anticipation knowing that your partner is going to be planning something soon."
2,Silly,"Silly. Banal. Boring. I got this book as a wedding shower gift and almost immediately started tearing pages out, looking forward to the erotic delights that would await me. All I can say is, ""Say what?"" If you've been married 50 years and never really liked your partner, these ideas might work. If not, you'll find them downright laughable."
3,my books on hold...after i bought it,"Well, I work in an adult store and thought to buy it (figured I might as well if I want to recommed it to people)The problem is she should really say ""for couple who live on their own"" or something along those lines. They ask for stuff to be done in the bathroom, or car, or kitchen. Its cool if you have your own place, but if you room with people (as I do) its hard.Also some things are hard to do if you don't got the time spent in preparing for it. I work 5 days a week and well if I plan to do this ""event"" on one of my days off I only got another day to get it all together and sometimes its just not enough time.So now it just sits on the shelf...collecting dust."
2,101 Nights of Great Sex,This book is not for everyone. I have been married for 30 years and our sex life has become limited to the same old things. I was hoping this book would give us new ideas. These ideas seem to be for the younger couple with younger minds. I don't want to be a sex stripper for my husband that seems shallow but have a deep connection with romance moves that are sensible. We opened some of the sealed sugestions and they seem like they are games that a bored young person would think of. Some seem very silly and don't promote a sexual response that we are looking for. As a Christian couple it seems very worldly and not for the couple that is wanting a mature sex life that is based on loving each other because of who you are. Rather it is trying to promote sex based on lust and porn.
1,This book was boaring.,It didn't have anything new just the basics. I think making love is great. Sex can be fun or boaring. My friends and I agree that I you just experiment a little with sex that it gets interesting. But then again I don't stay with the same guy for long. Sex is just fun not really only for love so experiment it gets good. Don't be afraid to try new things even some that people might think are sick. Just have fun with it. You don't need a book for that.
2,first page was opened,"This is a book of secret pages. Each page is supposed to be sealed and the only way you are supposed to read it is to purchase it and tear each page open along serrated edges. I purchased this book for my friend's bachelorette party. When it came, it looked new. I wrapped it and gave it to my friend at the party. Much to my embarrassment, she opened the book and the first ""day"" was already opened. Laughingly she asked me if I had been a little too curious. I told her I had purchased it on Amazon and it was said to be NEW! Needless to say, I was upset about this purchase and will think twice about ordering gifts on Amazon."
3,"Good, but not Grrrreat","Laura's book is great for getting ideas, but to do some of the things to the letter is kinda tough. However, I just ordered her other book (Grrreat Quickies) because she's got some great advice and ideas, and it's a really fun concept. I actually want to put 4 stars, but since there's too many people who have put 5 stars already, the 3 stars will make the overall average more realistic."
2,dissapointed,"I got this book as a ""joint"" present for my wife and myself expecting it assist us in adding ""life"" and ""spark"" to our sexlife. We have both been fairly dissapointed, though. You are supposed to tear out one page per week and do that for your spouse sometime during that week. I was instructed for my first assignment to fill a tub for my wife with burning candles around the room. We both do lots of things like that for each other anyway. Some of the assignments are sexual, others not so much. I think I might recommend this book to newlyweds, but not for people that have been married for any length of time. My wife and I both agreed that we have been able to use our own imaginations more evectively than we have been instructed thus far in the book. I would recommend each of you writing down 20 things that you've always wanted to do, regardless of shyness or fear, and put them into a hat. That way you can really spice things up, and save 30 bucks in the process."
4,"Passion, Sex and Intrigue-reignite that spark!","Could your love life use a little spice? If so, then this is the book for you! Remember those days when you were still in the ""honeymoon stage"" of your relationship? You know, the days when the thought of making love on a bar sounded ""hot"" not messy and uncomfortable. Well, this book helps couples recapture that passion by offering 101 steamy suggestions on how to bring their partner and themselves, more pleasure. The best part? Because each suggestion is sealed, you can never be sure if what your partner is doing was discussed in the book or if they're letting their imagination take over! Although I was hesitant upon reading some of the envelopes, I took the author's advice and let go of my inhibitions-which proved to be her best suggestion of all!"
2,"Cool Idea, but didn't Perform!","I bought this for my wife and I after hearing Laura speak on a radio show. I did think the little tear out 'His/Her Eyes Only' missions were kind of cool. HOWEVER, after having gone through about half of them, I must say that many of them are silly, and only improved our relationship by injecting a good laugh into our night. It's also funny that Laura's last name is Corn......because that's precisely what fills a good chunk of this book. It was a disappointment. One this this book DOES do is get a couple to shake themselves from routine and try something a little different. For that alone I think I'd buy this book again."
5,"Good,clean fun!",My husband and I got our copy almost a year ago and out book is so thin it is hardly reconizable. We have had more fun with it than we thought we could. We look forward to tearing out a page every Sunday night to see what next week will bring. With both of us working more than full time it keeps our sex life from turning into a quicky right before bed. I highly recommend Laura Corn's grrreat book!
5,So far I love this book,"I have just started this book and I have been sooooo happy with it. I love the idea of doing those things to my husband, but he absolutely drives me wild with anticipation when it comes time for him to do his. We have done things because of this book he wouldn't consider doing before. I am very very happy."
3,"More like 3.5 stars, but still worth a read!","I've looked this book up several times and finally got the nerve to buy it. (Not that we needed the book, it just seemed really fun, you know?) The book is thick and just screams...""Hold on tight!"" I chose the first ""idea"" and boy, was I completely annoyed with how hard it is for small, dainty, lady hands to rip those pages out. They look perferated, but they only minimally rip along the dotted lines. I nearly ripped the whole page out by accident! And then you have to rip the top and bottom off too. Argh. It was annoying. The task involved buying arm-length lace gloves...""at the mall"". I don't know where Laura Corn buys her clothes, but no mall near me stocks ""arm-length lace gloves"". And pearls? On a budget? Get real. Let's just say I spent $... on a nice lingerie set and improvised. Purchase with high hopes, but keep realistic in mindset. I can't wait to try more!!"
5,Great book to spice-up your sex life.,"I bought the book to get some ideas to find different things, and found a whole lot more. My wife is glad that I bought it."
1,Bad waste of good money,The ideas in this book are repetitive and quite simplistic. Not much in the way of anything exciting if you already have a life.
3,"Great for the women, but...","This book has great ideas to thrill the womwn in your life, but sorry gentlemen you will be GREATLY disappointed by the suggestions for the women to follow for the men. They are merely more ideas for the women... Laura has a good sense of what a women likes and by the way - these ideas have been great in that regard - but not a one of the suggestions for your S.O. are any good."
2,"Good concept, but no follow through","This book looks very intriguing but when it came right down to the actual ideas they were very basic. This book would be great for those who have no imagination or creativity when it came to their sex lives. But for those of us who do, been there done that!"
2,Ideas too expensive,"I felt that many of the poor guys' ideas were too expensive and took an awful lot of time for them to do! Unless all you have to do all day is seduce you significant other, this book is not too plausible. Some of the ideas seemed pretty dumb."
2,Not for everyone,"101 Nights of Grrreat Sex assumes that:1. You both have white collar jobs and a LOT of money.2. You own your own LARGE house.3. You both have the same days (and nights off)If you do not meet these requirements, you will need to do a lot of revising on the suggestions in this book to pull them off."
2,Good book for the open minded.,"I bought the book after hearing about it on the radio. My sex life was dull. My wife tried it for a while. We would each pull a page, one for him, one for her. Slowly thought the wife wanted to cut back, when I was having a great time. 2 each week, then 1 each week. then 1 every other week, till she said ""Let's not do the book anymore. It's not me"" Make sure if you buy this book that both people are open minded and agree to do what the book says."
2,"Its ok, Very corny","I got this book from a friend who used it for a while and didnt like it, but knew i was into this kinda stuff, so I gave it a shot. allot of these things are very corny and a bunch of them risky . Such as #21, these kinda things could get you in serious trouble, such as being arrested. and any of the ideas i liked are stuff my boyfriend and i already do, or are really exspensive."
4,amazing value,"I was a little skeptical about what this tool would look like for 26 bucks and change! But I must say after using it on a job, that it performs as well as the expensive ones! We'll have to wait and see about the longevity, but at that price you could buy 3 or 4 replacements! The only changes I would make is on the battery and swivel. I wish it could have a lock on it so when you put it in your tool belt that it would stay facing forward,and it is also kind of hard to get the battery to release from the tool unless you have a very large hand! otherwise it's a great tool for the money."
1,Picture is Wrong,"this picture totally misrepresents the actual package. there was no basting brush included. Also, it ended up being more expensive than I would ever have paid.....never again from an outside vendor"
3,Maxxis Locust Tire,"These tires are a great all around on and off road tire. Very low rolling resistance and work great on most off road conditions. Their weak point is that they tend to load up in mud conditions. But this is pretty much exactly how the manufacturer describes them. For the late season cyclocross races with wet and muddy conditions, I would like to get a tire with a more open pattern to more easily clear mud."
4,nice readings,"marcus say things like ""we must do for our selfs"" and one god , and one love, thats very true.."
2,"Some interesting nuggets, but overall an arduous and dated read","I purchased a used copy of this book in spring 2011, after my interest was piqued on another site. There are some interesting bits within this book that caught my interest. But I just couldn't get much beyond the first hundred pages. The book focuses on the late 80s, early 90s in the U.K. There's not much relevant to the U.S., despite the subtitle. The writing style of most of the authors is quite dry and dull - just not very readable. I've seen many other books on socioeconomics and policy that are more compelling - after this one, the reader is left thinking ""So what?"" I'm in the middle of too many books, and my reading time is too limited, to justify continuing on."
4,Its Cheap & It Works!,"Product is cheap for the price, only con is the product does not include a rotor screw. For about $10 to $15 dollar more, I would go with OEM. If you're short on a budget, this is cheap and you can just get a screw for the rotor at the dealership for around 60 cents."
2,Carefull Cross check part,The AZ part finder is not always accurate. This part does not fit a 1998 Accord 4Cyl. as indicated Use the part finder at manufacturers webs site to determine the correct part.
2,Made in Japan but no where near OEM fitment,"I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. After removing the cap I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap that came with the cap, see my other review. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. This rotor was a PITA to remove! Due to the lousy cap, the rotor was rusted on and had to be cut off. Even after installing the new one, I tried to remove it just out of curiosity and it was very hard to remove. I've never had this problem with OEM parts. I won't buy this rotor or the matching cap again."
5,Get a hold of this book,This book is totally worth the money. Things you didnt know about credit you will find out in this book.
5,Excellent useful guide,"A very useful well-written and interesting guide to a sometimes-overlooked city.Lille, 3rd (Bradt Travel Guide)"
3,"Wonderful photos, but not much else",The photos are great! There was little information to really tell about each gun pictured.
2,"not the best, but a nice looking book","this reveiw of history's firearms has one glaring ommision. the glock was not the first polymer framed handgun, however it was a major leap forward in the world of guns. hecklern and koch did it first, but glock made the concept of polymer frame usable and affordable.in addition to the lack of glocks, i also disliked the tone of some of his articles.note: his book, the gun: a visual history, does include mention of the G17."
1,Title is misleading,"I'd rather take my chances at the casino with the money I spent on this book.I did not like it at all. just like many other books it just gives you an overview of percentages and rules of each game. It doesn't get too deep into strategy.I was hoping for a great strategy for roulette and craps, but those 2 sections are only a couple of pages and 85% of those pages are to explain percentages and how to play the game"
1,Not recommended,"Excellent orchestra, excellent singers. However, Mozart's heavenly music is in constant dissonance with acting. Nothing is left for imagination: stupid touching of breasts, initiating women jumping on men in Hollywood style is cheap, scandalous and disillusioning.Alterations to the music do not improve the harmony either.Again a performance that may satisfy the taste of the rotten, materialistic elite, whose 2000 years old enemy, the cross is still alive and centre.If you are looking for real Mozart, this is not for you!"
3,"good book, would of been better if i had all the pages",good book plenty of worksheets and problems is straight to the point. would recommend it is way cheaper than the college textbook.
4,Relief at last!,"I am in my 1st trimester of pregnancy and to have found these is just awesome to me! I was prescribed some tablets to take but they make me really drowsy, no good with a 3yo running around! Quick relief so far.. making life a little more bearable :) Pharmacist said they are safe during pregnancy so long as you take as directed. Music to my ears! Would recommend these to anyone in my boat!!!"
1,"100,000% Shovelware","From a historical and economic and sociological perspective, this book is utter propaganda.For example, from page 340, ""To date, India's engineers and entrepreneurs have had the most success following the path Wiener chartered for their country's advancement, and while their numbers are still small compared to the whole of their population, they are reaping many of the benefits Weiner envisioned without the drawbacks of older models of industrialization.""Joke!There is categorically no relationship between India's newfound economic success and Norbert Wiener. None. Na-da. Nothing. Zip-0!And that was just a single sentence from this text. Just imagine what else lurks in 400 pages of writing from what are two absolute fools. Flo conway and Jim siegelman are the stupidest writers ever!"
1,typo city,"I bought this edition of schaum's ad calc toreplace my beloved but dog-eared first edition(by Murray Spiegel alone).Luckily I held onto the original because thisversion is a disaster in terms of typos introduced -especially in the sections on transforms.On top of that, the publishers inexplicablyplaced Murray Spiegel's name second (and evenout of alphabetical order!!) on the cover. This isan unforgivable disrespect of scholarship and ofthe memory of a terrific author who wassingle-handedly responsible for most of theoriginal and excellent math texts from schaum's."
5,Ideal (solved examples) companion to your calculus textbook,"If you are studying calculus, the books from Schaum will certainly help you to develop your problem solving ability.This is NOT a real analysis textbook inspired on Bourbaki topology. So that some readers do not consider the material really advanced. I think they were expecting 18 ways to express the Axiom of Choice (Zorn Lemma for example) Godel conjecture, Fixed point theorems, path and non-path conected sets, differential forms, more terminology (homeomorphism, diffeomorphism, manifolds) etc...The book has an approach similar to Piskunov or G.B. Thomas Junior books, that is, more elementary approaches (but note that elementary does not mean easy). Many solved problems.Look at table of contents inside the book at amazon to grasp an idea of what you will get.Overall, very good companion, practical and with many examples."
3,Tough book,"This book is definitely more challenging than the ""Demystified"" series of review books. It doesn't do a great job of reviewing some of the building blocks that you will need to really solve every problem. I had to go online to check up on some trig IDs for a couple of problems, and I should have been able to look those up in book, but they were nowhere to be found."
1,Moves too fast. Does not spend enough time on each topic.,"My Advanced Calculus class covered only the first two chapters. While we were spending time on detailed analysis of different types of infinities, this book did not cover it at all. This book was almost no help. Make sure the style of the teacher matches the way this book is written, otherwise it may be a waste. My class would have been a lot easier and less satisfying if it had been conducted the way this is written."
5,Christmas present,My son got a new guitar from 'Santa' and he took of the one that came with it and switched to this one right away.
4,Great Look,"This guitar strap is fantastic, I have very long arms so it's hard for me ti find straps that hang the guitar low enough for me. But this one has a great length to suit pretty much anyone. I have it on a les paul with some new strap locks and it is fantastic"
5,Melelana by Keali'i Reichel,"On a recent trip to the Big Island of Hawaii, my husband and I were continually hearing ""Ipo Lei Momi"" from Melelana, wherever we went. When we couldn't get it out of our heads, we headed for a local bookstore for a copy of this fabulous cd. This purchase has truly become one of the best souveniors of our vacation as it brings back the spirit of the Hawaiian people and their beautiful language. Thanks Keali'i Reichel and keep the beauty of your language and music coming!"
5,Keali`i Reichel is Hawai`i.,"Keali`i Reichel is one of the best well known popular recording artists in Hawai`i.He is the multi award winner of the prestigious Na Hoko Hanohano Hawai`ian music awards.And the kumu hula of the Halau Kea`alaokamaile on Maui.His music ranges from inspirational Hawai`ian chants to stunningly beautifulcontemporary Hawai`ian songs.He has a unique warm charismatic voice, accompanied by the best musicians in Hawai`i.That transports you to Paradise, The Hawai`ian Islands.Out of all his CDs ""Melelana"" meaning floating song is his best to date. (5 Stars.)It contains some stunning Hawai`ian contemporary songs and lovely traditional hula mele.If you love Hawai`i and it`s culture. Keali`i Reichel CDs are must buys.To enjoy an excellent selection of his music ""Kamahiwa"" his best of Vol 1 (5 Stars),and ""Kamalei"" his best of Vol 2 (5 Stars) are both highly recommended."
5,Wonderful Memories,"I bought this CD when I was on a vacation of a lifetime with my son. We both agreed that it was the BEST vacation we ever took. It was after a long, cold Chicago Winter both outside and in our souls. This music takes my heart and soul back to wonderful memories of warm breezes, gentle spirits and beautiful landscapes. This music moves your heart and soul. Perfect to play on a cold winter night."
5,Best Hawaiian Singer,"I had 3 of Keali'i Reichel's cassetts, which I purchased in Hawaii in 1996. They have since fell apart from playing them too much. I am now replacing them with CD's. ""Melelana"" was the next one (by recorded date)that I needed to purchase, it is number 4. I love his voice. I love the music. I love the Hawaiian chants. These songs and music just put me back in Hawaii. They are so mellow, and so is his voice. I love his chants, he is really keeping his heritage alive. I will eventually buy all his albums."
3,Not the Best Bang for the Buck,"Roxy Music is one of the greatest bands in history. However, the exact same live footage, plus additional songs, can be found on another DVD called Best of Musikladen: T-Rex/Roxy Music. Luckily I was able to rent this title before purchase. Otherwise, I would have been upset as the description does not give you enough information to figure this out."
3,Make that 3.5....,"I'm surprised that there haven't been more reviews of this album. Stereolab's first release in quite a while is more in line with their 'Switched On' series than their studio releases (NOTE: this is not a new studio album), so it's tough to know who to recommend it to. If you're a little turned off by their electronic shenanigans, then it's a great opportunity to hear a more stripped-down Stereolab relying more on their instruments to make their sound. If, like me, you're thrilled with their more polished and eclectic works, this might be a bit of a letdown. Nevertheless, it's two discs of solid pop tracks that include some new versions of their best songs. For fans, it's a must-have (natch), but it might not be the best introduction for newcomers. That said, if you like them more live than you do on CD, then this is the Stereolab album for you."
5,Not for non-thinking Christians!,Wow! I was blown away and so surprised by Books & Culture. It's wonderful. One word of warning: have a dictionary handy. The writing can be fairly lofty at times.
3,The weakest of the trilogy,In my opinion he should have kept The Salterton Trilogy in Salterton. The characters in Europe where too real. I enjoyed the caricaturish Salterton characters much better. This book does seem to have a bit more of a plot than the first two but I'm not sure Davies is that worried about plot in his books. Guess I'll have to read the other two trilogies to find out.
4,Good buy,Book wasn't in great shape but that was fine. It was a fantastic read and arrived earlier than expected. Thanks!
3,"A ""women's"" book for men too","The thing I most appreciated about this, is that, going beyond what is certainly a laudable and needed concern for violence against women, Ensler had some sidebar comments about how women have all too often essentially ""downloaded"" their security needs onto men without wanting men to talk about their own security needs.That said, while the overall content of the book is decent, and does have some bits of reflectiveness by Ensler, there's just not a tremendous amount of ""there"" there all the time."
1,Audacious ..... and idiotic,"This book is a sad and doctrinaire excuse for analysis. Ms E. blithely equates a reasonable concern for security with a paranoid, life-denying obsession without missing a beat, and in doing so sets up a transparent straw man. It is a dishonest argument, even a dangerous one. It is a caricature of a thoughtful exploration of the issue. Ms E speaks often of the value of the ability to think originally and understand all sides of an argument. Aside from giving lip service to these laudable attributes, she shows absolutely no interest or capacity to do so. Her energetic (and of course, undocumented) litany of the crimes of modern America do little to persuade the attentive reader of their correctness or (not that it seems to matter to her), their relevance.The issue of the security is a complex and vital one on many levels. Ms E's diatribe makes no contribution to the discussion. Actually, more than any book in memory, the cover sums it up perfectly."
3,Light on details,"There is interesting material in this DVD but I found it is very light on useful marketing details. The marketing information is targeted at the real beginner. The producer spends too much time demonstrating largely outdated software but skims over the marketing decisions.For example (and this is just one example) he barely mention price (""I like to sell DVD costing more than $40""), does not discuss affiliate percentages, customer discounts... which are all important decisions but he spends a lot of time showing to fill in the screens in his 5 years-old shopping cart with those details.It would have more useful to discuss the pricing strategy, how to use discounts to market, etc. and leave it to us to figure out how to use current software.Again there are some useful ideas in the DVD but there's probably no more than 15 minutes of them. The remainder is a long demonstration of outdated software."
5,my grandson can't play this often enough,"I gave this gift to my 3 year old grandson for Christmas. Long after the other toys were left behind, he played constantly with this one. It's set up as a matching game, which stimulates his mind while appealing to his love of Thomas the Train. This game gets parents involved too--what could be better that a family playing together? I highly recommend it!"
3,Pretty Good,"This is the first Susan Wren mystery I've read, though it isn't the first in the series. Charlotte Weir proves herself to be a very good writer. She writes very clearly, and is an interesting and pleasant read. Characters are varied and very well constructed. There were a couple cases where I thought she phrased something strange (like the cold ripping her face off, or something akin to that). That would take my concentration away from my reading. I think she crafted her plot very well. But I think in this book she used too many characters. I was losing track who was who. I was setting the book down a lot and not getting back to it for maybe a week at a time. Maybe the character confusion came because of my slowness in reading it. I'll buy another and try it."
1,Misunderstood,"The title of this book suggested to me that the author was willing to address the cogent subject of the text, but I was mistaken. The book can help my studies to some degree, but at best the material is superficial and inadequate.I was also hoping for a brand new copy, however, I received a used one."
2,"Great design, poor workmanship","I love the design of this toy and so does my son. BUT, I sent the first one back because one of the crews was stripped and kept turning. I sure didn't want it to fall out one one and my son finding it. It had some paint marks on the inside and piece of wood on the inside was broken. Then, I got a replacement one that has one screw stripped once again and the 4 screws to screw the top were missing altogether and of course more paint on the inside. Made in China with lots of paint which also makes me nervous. Their quality control sucks, I can't believe that two out of two products are both defective. I feel bad for Amazon paying for shipping back and forth to send me new and will keep the second one, but will NOT purchase any more products from Anatex. This toy cost around $100 and for this kind of money, I expect quality. And this product is not quality."
1,Poor Quality,"You would think paying $129 would get you a nice quality wood toy, but this thing arrived with stripped screws, two sharp edges and the stickers on the PLASTIC gears were not even adhered properly and were already falling off. So much for made in the USA. :-("
4,Very nice toy,I bought this for my 10 month old grand son. He plays with it several times a day but it will probably be better when he gets a little older. I had one problem right out of the box. One of the holes for a part you have to screw to the toy was damaged (to big). I had to take peaces of a broken tooth pick and put them in the hole along with super glue and then put the screw in. That fixed it. I would recommend this toy.
4,Wonderful Toy and very much worth the money!,"This is one of the best toy in market these days. We just bought this yesterday and my daughter is loving it already. It has so much to do on it and will keep her busy for a while I am sure. Talking about the quality, I think we've got much improved version of it as it seems very solid and no stickers...infact its all painted now so it looks very high quality. A must have for every kid!!!"
5,My 11-mo old loves it!,"When my husband & I first thought of getting our son a bead maze we did a lot of research. This one was rated fairly well so we decided to get it. We're so glad we did! Our baby loves it!!! He plays with it all the time.From what I can tell, it's very sturdy as it stands up to him shaking it. :) I also love that it's educational."
3,Well made toy - but doesn't excite our daughter,"In an effort to avoid the sea of generic plastic toys I purchased the play cube for my daughter. She has shown very little interest in it.When she was first standing, she would use the metal ""maze"" tracks to pull up on. If nothing else, it's a testament to how sturdy they are. At different times she played with the gears and top maze.Overall though, this has been one of her least used toys. Even the various cheap toys she has received as gifts get pulled out of their bins every now and then. The cube, however, is just taking up space.It's certainly a high quality toy, but it just may not excite every kid - which hurts a little given the cost."
3,Pretty Darn Fun,The spinning wheel sticker was damaged when it arrived but both of my children love it and they are 3 and 9 months.
3,Poor quality toy but fun,"I just received the toy yesterday and upon initial examination I was quite disappointed. The wood on one of the sides had completely cracked from top to bottom. Some of the paint chipped off the wheels. I found one of the wooden cogs to be stuck. Also, one of the washer like things on the top of the toy was cracked. I am returning this product today. It's such a shame because my 9 month old daughter LOVES this toy."
2,Make sure yours was made in the usa,I bought this toy 2 years ago for my sons birthday. I paid more because it said it was in the usa... mine was not made in the usa. I had too much going on at the time to send it back. It is a great toy but I would not have bought it if I knew it was not made in the usa.Just make sure when you get yours that it is in fact made in the usa
4,Bryce's Mom,This is a great learning toy for young children. My Son loves to play with the beads on the roller coaster and the gears. I love the alphabet with pictures on the spinning blocks. My Son is only one and we are starting to work on all these fun learning activities. We hope to have many years of fun and learning with this item.
1,wow! This was AWFUL.,"I ordered this for my 18 month and 3 year old daughters. I get that the title says mini but I was really surprised how small it was. The top didn't sit on the box properly and the peg maze didn't move fluidly at all. It was like it was made by child labor in a third world country and passed off as a nice educational toy. I returned it the day it arrived. Really, this thing is almost a joke. I truly can't understand how anyone could give this a good review. It's just terrible."
1,Not worth the money,My son received this toy as a birthday present. The beads were damaged to the point where I needed to saw some of them off so they wouldn't injure my children. The paint is horrible. Over all this is a horrible toy.
2,WARNING PAINT COMES OFF!!!!!,"The paint came off of the green metal and I pray to the lord my 1 year old did not eat it!!! Also, the edges are extremely sharp and not safe, she fell while playing with the toy and cut open her head by her temple."
3,Entertaining,"Although our daughter loved the one she saw in the doctors office, she is only mildly amused by this one. I find the gear side a bit ""dangerous"" as it's easy to get a little figure stuck in the gears... other than that probably the top wire raceways are the only things she really is into at this time. As she grows, we'll have to see if anything else on it interests her..."
4,Good educational toy.,"Bought this for my 20-month-old granddaughter. It's one of her favorite toys and she plays with it every day. The only problem I encountered was that the wires on the bead maze were so compressed the beads wouldn't slide through the maze. It was difficult to pull them out to correct the problem but, once done, it worked fine. Other than that, it's a great educational toy."
5,Kid's Activity Cube,I bought this for my 1-year old granddaughter and she loves it. Best yet her 3-year old brother can play on one side while she's busy on another side without conflict. Lots of activities to keep them busy!
3,It is a good toy but...,"I wish it was made like a table. I was buying it for a child younger than 1 year at the time. The things that didn't work out for us that great are: 1) it didn't encourage my child to be standing up, and since he was constantly interested in ptactising with standing up at the time he didn't pay that much attention at the level of his feet where all the cubes, wheels, etc. are; 2) when he was standing up with its help holding on the wires, it was falling on a side (it is hollow inside and not that sturdy); 3) it has massive corners, so falling near this cube was making me extremely nervous all the time.Generally, the product is made for a good purpose. It is also made in the USA. I am sure my child will get back to it later. Such toys don't lose its purpose until closer to school maybe.Thanks!"
4,great! but small issue,My 22month daughter loves this! She's been playing with it since she received it on christmas. Its a great size and can move it around easily to fit in many areas. The reason why I didn't give it a 5 was because one of the alphabet letters were screwed up!!! The letter C had a picture of a grape on the back and the word grape...wwooooooww. for $99 it would be nice if everything was RIGHT!!....so I had to create a picture of a car and paste it on the back of the letterC TO COVER THE PICTURE OF GRAPES.
3,Not Worth the Money,Product was not as nice as one would expect for the price. I would go with a cheaper version if I did it all over again.
4,"Fun yet boring, Colorful yet dull.","I originally bought a 'fun cube' at Target and it fell apart (did this 3 times) and returned them all. I did a mega-google-search and compared MANY 'fun cubes' and read ALL the reviews. I settled on the Anatex because of the solid build and the included activities (but mostly the solid build). I am going to take many of the activities off and my wife is going to paint a more appealing background on the sides. My child was very interested in the box from Target, but not so much this one, yet the activities are very similar - I am not sure why. So.... Solid build, Many activities, Colorful Activities, Boring side 'colors', and the child is not as interested as hoped. I like spinning the gears!"
5,Taking Werewolves and Vampires to a Whole New Level,"This novel tells the story of Brit Chambers, a woman who serves as a consultant to a whole menagerie of were-creatures. A were-tiger friend offers her as a gift to the vampire Lord Daison, who uses her as a blood donor. She's also sent on a quest to destroy the legendary and supposedly indestructible Sacred Scepters -- devices that have the power to eliminate all magic. Whoever wields them could rule the world.What makes this novel refreshing is that A.B. Wallace drops us into a whole new world of swords and sorcery as well as vampires and were-creatures -- and not just wolves, there are creatures of all sorts. Brit Chambers is a strong female lead who could fight easily fight side-by-side with either Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Conan the Barbarian. The story is engaging with plenty of twists and turns and a satisfying conclusion. This one is well worth checking out."
1,"One star because they smell good, but DOES NOT WORK!","We had mice invading the house last winter (2007-2008 season) and nothing was working to encourage the guys to pack up and move.Due to the quantity of pets we have, we wanted something that wouldn't harm the dogs if they contacted it (so Decon and snap traps were out).We received these and placed them around according to the package instructions.We had no decline in mice populations in the house.In the end we ultimately had to resort to snap traps baited with caramel candy.These got one star because they smell like spearmint gum when initially opened, but the smell fades within a day and then you have a cloth packet that does nothing."
1,Is it just me?,"So, after the electronic gismo didn't work, I came across Bonide Mouse Magic. I bought the four pack (just to see if it would work) I placed one pack where I've seen a mouse come into the laundry room. Within one hour it was gone, the mouse had carried it off!! So, thinking more is better, I placed the other three packs out and waited. I actually saw a mouse crawl right over the packs. Now, I am afraid its poison or the flame thrower."
1,very dissapointed,We placed Mouse magic in our garage to repel mice. I hate using other ways to get rid of them and this seemed ideal. They have been there three days and today I found mouse turds all around a packet and they had bit a hole in it. They had been attracted to it. How was this tested? It did leave a nice smell in the garage.
1,Attracts mice,"I put six packs in my motor coach. before mouse magic I caught one mouse in one of three snap traps.. after mouse magic was distributed I caught 2 mice, one in each trap. next day, two more mice in traps. third day two more, fourth day only one. I set each trap next to a mouse magic pack. I guess they really like the smell."
1,does absolutely nothing,"Well, almost nothing. I suppose they make my cabinets smell somewhat pleasant (though strongly minty). As for the mice, no, they crawl all over them. Before the repellent I can catch 1-2 mice a day. With the repellent I can catch 1-2 mice a day. Nice idea, but save your money."
1,No Good At All,Joining the crowd of folks who were totally disappointed in this product. Returned it to the store today.
1,Disappointed,"We bought these walkie talkies for my 5 year old grandson's birthday and they did not work. Even being right next to each other, we could not hear anything but static. Had to return them to Toys R Us. Little Tikes is usually the best. Very disappointed."
1,Piece of junk!!!,My son received these Walkie Talkies yesterday for his birthday. He was so excited as I told him we could play hide & seek with them. We put in batteries that we already had and they didn't work. So early this morning I went out and bought brand-new batteries...and they still don't work!!!!!!!!! All you hear is static...and can only hear a muffle of another voice if the person yells. I will try & return although they were received as a gift.
1,Not what you expect from a name like Little Tikes,"I have come to trust most anything that says Little Tykes. Durable, reliable, researched, but am totally disappointed in this purchase. The kids enjoyed the buttons and making the morse code come through on the walkie talkies, however they were not able to get a good signal in any way to hear each other talk. Do not waste your money. Give them two cups with a string and they will learn more."
1,Frustration is all you will get,"I bought two sets of these for three kids - age 3 1/2 to 7 to play with - we thought it would be great - each kid could have one and a grown up could have the fourth. I put the batteries in before wrapping them and we tried them out - couldn't get them to transmit anything. The only way we can get them to where you can hear the other person talking is to stand face to face. We have tried now for over a week to solve the issues - they just don't work - I expected better from ""Little Tikes"". There's nothing you can adjust - we unplugged all the other electronics in the house in case something else was on the same channel - nothing works. Save yourself the frusteration and upset kids. Buy something else."
2,LT Walkie Talkies,"My 3 and 5 yr olds played with this for 3 minutes and dropped them on the floor.. the range is OK, but the kids didn't find it interesting... and the 3 yr old didn't get the concept of holding down the buttons to talk and releasing to listen. Perhaps it is intended for older children."
1,Didn't even work!,"I bought these for Christmas a few years back for my son. When we opened up the item and put batteries in it we realized that one of the walkie talkis knobs was busted, so you couldn't use it. Very poor quality! We returned it right away!"
1,Are you sure this was made by Little Tikes?,"We bought this toy as a Christmas gift motivated by our kids always pretending the baby monitor was a walkie talkie. Obviously since our monitor is not a walkie talkie type, there was a lot of yelling going on by at least one child. This toy was worse. They were so excited to get a ""real one"" but that only lasted until we put the batteries in. This toy just would not work. Unfortunately, we opened all the gifts and disgarded the packaging before we realized it was a piece of junk. Therefore, since it is an electronic, without the packaging even with the receipt you can only exchange it. It took a visit with the Toys R Us manager to get a store credit instead. So, learn from my mistake and do not just save the receipt but the packaging as well when buying electronics until you know it is going to work!"
1,Same as all the others,"We didn't put batteries in for a month and we had more fun with them before we did put the batteries in. They do not work at all - no trasmission, no reception, only one even gets static. I had a walkie talkie set 30 years ago when I was a kid and it worked much better than this set."
1,Not pleased with this toy at all!,"I bought these for my 4 year old son. He was very excited to have real walkie-talkies all his own. Too bad they don't work. You have to scream into them for the other person to hear you, and even then it is barely audible. I'm surprised that a company such as little tikes would market such a junky product. I will think twice before purchasing a product made by this company again."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I agree with all the other reviews. My children received them as a gift. Wish I would not have thrown out the package, cause they would be going right back to the store. What a terrible probuct Little Tikes made this time around. They absoulutely do not work. No reception and you can't hear anyone or even try to talk. Please don't waste your money, these are worthless toys.Unfortunately, they do not offer an option of not putting in any stars, so I had to put one star in each category even though there is nothing to want on this product."
4,"Simple, yet Elegant","I really enjoy the necklace that was sent to me. It is fresh, sexy and elegant all rolled into one. I hope it lasts a long time and does not tarnish."
5,awesome brush,These hair brushes were the rage when I was in junior high. I have had one since then. It is a great brush and lasts forever. Worth the price!
5,isinis brush,I have had one of these brushes for 20 years. I finally got tired of my daughters borrowing it so I ordered one for each of them. It gets out the tangles without all fo the drama.
4,This Horn is SILVER - Not BLACK and NO RED STRIPE,"If I wanted a SILVER colored horn like in the picture I supplied, I would have bought one of those. There are many of them for less than this.Fake! I am obviously upset.** UPDATE **: So, it is Dec 2012 and I am updating this. I found this exact same horn at the local auto parts store. It was black with the red stripe, and I bought it. Got home to swap out the horns and noticed the one I got on here was an FIAMM brand. So, I would guess whoever shipped me my stuff simply sent the wrong item. I never thought to check that it was the right brand, though.I have updated my star rating to 4. Can't find myself able to give it 5."
4,Works as advertised,"I purchased this to put on my 2002 Honda 919 motorcycle. The speaker is very similar to stock with the exception that the terminals are near the bottom of the speaker (the stock terminals are at the top). This required a little extra wiring. This isn't a big deal, just something to note. It works as advertised and definitely looks better than the stock horn."
3,"deceptive picture, good horn","The horn itself works as expected, however the picture is incorrect. Pictured is a 310-2T. The 300-2T is the disc style."
2,Disappointing,I listened to the brief excerpts available on Amazon and was convinced I would find this uplifting and was regrettably disappointed.
4,"Nice pickup, nice price","This is the first acoustic pickup I've bought, and I'm very happy with it. It is nice and solid, well made, and sounds very good, no hum or feedback. I tried the cheaper Duncan pickup before and this one is a big step up. Really works well with electric strings on my humble Alvarez. I haven't tried adjusting the poles yet, but that was a big motivator for choosing this model."
4,Abandon all hope,"No one plays this kind of soul-crushingly bleak gothic/death/doom metal quite like My Dying Bride. The UK-based band buries the listener in a tomb of sonic darkness so complete that light can neither enter nor escape. My Dying Bride has really perfected this sound, especially on later releases, but I still prefer their early work, which tends to have more death metal elements than gothic elements. Trinity is a perfect example.Trinity collects all of the early (and out of print) My Dying Bride EPs - Symphonaire Infernus, The Thrash of Naked Limbs, and I Am the Bloody Earth - onto one disc. Peaceville's 2004 reissue of Trinity adds two bonus tracks - Vast Chorus and Catching Feathers - making this relatively low-priced disc an even better bargain.Trinity is a must-have album for fans of this kind of music, and is the perfect starting point for anyone unfamiliar with My Dying Bride."
2,Romance set a little after the Regency time period,American Heroine who manges amongst other things to get caught in a man trap. Lots of social issues. Mention of Peelers so definitely post Regency unless the author has her details wrong.
2,"""WHERE'S JOE?""","My two sons fell in love with ""Joe Scruggs-From Deep in the Jungle"" so I ordered this tape for more Joe fun. The problem is, this is a tape of cartoons. My kids asked ""Where's Joe"" throughout because, although Joe Scruggs sings the songs, he only appears on the video at the very beginning to introduce what's to follow. The ""Deep in the Jungle"" tape is so wonderful because it's taped from a live performance with a lot of inter-action with the audience. ""Joe TV"" may feature some good songs but the cartoons accompanying them are second rate at best. My kids walk away from this one after the third song."
4,Nice Item,I got a great book at a fair price. It was in a little tougher shape than I expected but I am very happy with the pruchase and the speed of delivery.
4,US history,"I found this book to be very helpful. Before I used this book, I had a low score, but after I used it my score increased by 160 points! This book gives the reader the ""big picture"" that is extremely useful for the test. I couldn't have done it without this book."
5,I Love Burton Watson's Translation.,"I have read many different translations of Chuang Tzu. I find many of them either too awkward, wordy, biased or incomprehensible. Admittedly, it is not possible to learn Taoist philosophy without a teacher's explanation. Unfortunately, books do not always answer questions. However, given that limitation, this translation is the clearest I have ever encountered."
5,The book is clear relative to other books I read,"The book is relatively clear. The translater does some times misunderstand the author's intent. Some things could be translated better, to accommodate humor that I believe the author intended"
2,Non-Hygienically Friendly DVD,"Not a Natural Hygiene video in any sense. They use Raw, Natural Products w/ Salt, Agave Necctar; etc that is counter productive to proper food combining rules. This Video will suffice for those who have never ate Raw in any way before, now wanting to transition to even a subtle, but non-condusive change."
1,too wordy,"Okay, too wordy may seem ridiculous, it's a book right?Only if you want the doctor's version, give me the layperson'sversion."
4,good information,informative and pretty close to what I was thinking as far as addressing the issues in my life
5,Good Read,"I have been into nutrition for the past 40 years and consequently I have read many books and articles on this subject. While I do not feel the diet is IDEAL, it is a more pragmatic approach that the average dieter might follow and surely better than the fast food diets of millions of people. I did learn a few things and the content was a good review in other areas. I plan to check out this:Banaba Leaf."
4,Reader from DC,"Excellent book! I have only recently heard about Cortisol and the roll it plays in weight gain, and Talbott does a good job of explaining how it works. I feel as though he were writing about me. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I felt he could have explained more about eating on the plan itself, instead of just giving an example for one day of meals."
3,"Excellent guitar, indifferent songs, poor vocals","This is a guitar player's disc for sure. Landau was known as one of the core session players in the 1980s-90s LA scene and, like a top session guy, he crafts his tone well. The playing is a mix of Hendrix and SRV, which is delivered with flash if also in a somewhat overbearing way. The one exception to derivative playing is the final number -- Killing Time -- which is an extraordinarily beautiful solo with an Octavia that shows what Landau can do when he steps part his influences. The singing is awful and the tunes only mediocre (save the Hendrix cover (which is in no way superior to the original, by the way!)). Landau's music nowadays is much more his own thing, his tone can continued to mature and, oh, that reverb! Only a studio pro could dial it in so well. Three stars because saved by the guitar."
5,THIS DUDE IS REALLY GOOD,THIS MAN CAN MAKE IT TO THE TOP.I LIKE HOW HE EXPRESS HIS SELF IN TELLING ABOUT HOW HE LIVE
2,Too Much for too little,"I'll have to be honest with you, I hadn't had a set of these in years, and when I recently purchased a Fender American Deluxe Precision 5 stringer, I bought a pack of these to restring it.The results were pretty dead sounding right out of the package in standard tuning. I tuned it down a step and they were even worse. The tension wasn't beefed up enough for my tastes and the sound was way to warm, almost dull."
5,The best bass strings in the world,"These are without a doubt the best strings in the world. I have used them exclusively for over ten years. I used to use rotosound strings, not too shabby of a string either, but, these babies blow them away. Great monster tone and nice flexability. They last longer than most strings I have used in the past. Try them you'll love them."
4,4 & a half stars!! A must have for any Metal fan!,"This is Mortification's best CD in my opinion among all of them, even though Scrolls of the Megiloth is actually heavier. Post Momentary Affliction is great metal CD because the songs are brilliantly crafted, the double-bass pedals of Jayson Sherlock are incredible, and the death growls of Steve Rowe fits this sound. The entire CD is not filled with death metal growling, but most of it is and it is better for it! The standout cuts are: From The Valley of Shadows,"" ""Grind Planetarium,"" and ""Overseer."" Take a chance in 2004 and go back and buy a CD from over a few years ago. You will enjoy it."
4,"Skimmed it once, then read it cover to cover. Informative.","The first time I picked up this book I just skimmed it. It was so interesting that I then read it from cover to cover. Informative, interesting. The author covered the subject very well.I would read parts of it again and again."
4,"It's Perfect for the Base IR Combo, but Expect to Use another set of Headphones","I purchased this unit knowing full well I was going to be using it for the wireless base and portable unit only. When I first received the unit I was bold enough to try out the headphones that came with the unit. All I can say is wearing the headphones was like water torture in a Chinese prison camp.The IR combo is fantastic for what it is. Sure it's a little noisy. Sure it has a limited range. Sure you can't put a giant cabinet between you and the base unit. But how many other units let you use whatever headphones you want instead of the garbage they want you to AND doesn't cost an arm and a leg?Great job Koss, but why the Chinese Torture headphones? You could have just thrown in a set of cheap earbuds."
3,OK for the money,"If you're not looking for high end fidelity, and you aren't moving around the house when using these headphones, then this product is pretty good for the money. We use it to watch TV while exercising on treadmill so it's a perfect application. The advice from others to keep the main unit's volume as low as possible is a must or you will get a horrible distortion. But once you set it up correctly it sounds fine. I like this unit because you can use any headphone, not just the cheap unit they provide."
1,Worthless,"This product is horrible. If you use it next a plasma tv, there no way to describe the horrible noise that comes out of these things. Used with a normal tv, there is just the obnoxious hissing sound that most other people describe. This hissing sound wasn't helped at all if standing 2 inches away or five feet, and changing the headphones didn't help at all. Please don't waste your money."
1,A good idea but...,"It just didn't do at all what I wanted. I just wanted my mom to be able to listen to a cd without having to carry around a cd player, but no matter where she put the transmitter she'd get static if she walked more than a couple of feet for it. On top of that, I've been trying to return this product for a month now, and haven't heard from PC Universe so I finally had to contact Amazon. Just not great overall."
1,Intolerable sound,"Intolerable sound. The noise is a single frequency, I don't know why they couldn't have built a filter in to eliminate it"
3,Works good but - Ouch!,"The headphones pinch my ears and tend to fall of easily I've had to go back to my old headphones after only an hour or two of use. On the bright side, any set of headphones can plug into the wireless transmitter. Otherwise works good."
2,"Cute, but there must be a better solution out there!","Pros: Stylish, smallCons: Does not provide a stable platform, does not include a charging light, Blue Light remains on, awkward connection point for cables, difficult PDA connection socketWhen I bought this, it was the only desktop charging cradle available. I needed one, so got it. Since then I see other 3rd party units have come out that include a charging light and are about half the cost. It functions and looks cool - hence two stars. Otherwise, I am not pleased with it - too hard to get the PDA in and out of the unit, no charging light, and most importantly it is not stable enough to allow for accurate writing on the PDA as it constantly moves and tilts with just the slightest pressure."
3,Nothing Exceptional !,"The cradle comes with this rather bright illumination, (perfect night light)that stays lit 24/7, but otherwise nothing exceptional !!"
1,Very bad quality product,"I was used to old Palms which used to have a cradle included in the package. Well, I bought a T5 with no cradle and decided to purchase a cradle separately. I got two of these kits and I am very disappointed: both sync-buttons didn't work and I had to open the cradles and fix them; and, unlike the old ones, the base is very unstable. Worst: I wanted to complain directly to Palm, but there's no E-Mail address for customer communication! Where's the quality control? No customer care policy??? Unfortunately, there's no alternative for the ones who need a cradle for the T5. Palm should care more for its customers and have a more responsible quality control policy. Better thinking, there's an alternative: buy a Pocket-PC!!!"
5,"Tungsten E2, T5 & Lifedrive Compatible","Rated the items 5 stars, but have not had a chance to test it as my LifeDrive has not yet arrived. The rating is based on price/features. This is the same drive Palm is selling. While the title suggests it is for the Tungsten T5, the packaging confirms it is compatible with the Tungsten E2, T5 and LifeDrive. Thanks K.Santomas for pointing this out, and to Amazon for offering it."
3,Cradle me Tx?,"When my last Vx died, I bought a TX. It's got lots of cool features, but the cradle charger/sync device isn't one of them. It's functional, but no where as easy to use as the cradles for the V and earlier series. That may have to do with the more complex connectors, but whatever, it does require greater care and attention to what you're doing than the older ones. That said, it's not a reason not to purchase -- just my opinion."
3,Not with a leather case!,"The cradle will not work with a Palm in a leather case. The cradle I had for the T2 did work with a case. Luckily, the power and sync cables can be removed from the cradle and plugged together (there's a little connector module) into the the TX. I would have gotten the vehicle charger instead if I knew this."
1,Did not work. Too busy to return it.....Not Happy,This item did not work with my Palm TX.I am not happy with the product at all.
4,Functional,This device does what it is designed to do. I was suprised that the cradle does not have the smooth connect/disconnect as other Palm devices have.
1,Won't work with TX,The TX locks up when you put in the cradle regardless if the cradle is plugged. Mine went straight into the trash. Very annoying.
3,Was about to return it but got it working,"I purchased this cradle to use my Palm TX as a music player, like the iPod cradles.The first 4 times I tried the cradle, with only the power cord since I don't intend to use it to sync, my Palm TX locked up. At this point I decided to return the cradle and went to the Palm website to get the name of the cradle patch file that I no longer need. I deleted the cradle update, but decided to try the cradle once without the patch.The Palm hasn't locked up since, so I hope that the problem was the cradle patch. I will test it thoroughly over the next few days to make sure it is working properly.HOW TO DISABLE THE LIGHT!My Palm TX syncs perfectly when using the original sync cable connected to the cradle. One bonus of using the original sync cable is that the cradle charges my TX, but the cradle light doesn't come on. The light only comes on if I connect a power cable to the cradle."
3,"Works well, but...","I agree with the other reviewers, the base for this unit is very lightweight plastic, feels cheap. It works just fine, however, and considering I couldn't find a charger/synch cord anywhere in the area, I'm grateful to have it!"
1,Instantly retired the cradle,"Fifteen minutes after I opened the box, the cable it came with is plugged into my TX and the cradle is in a drawer. With the cradle, I had to take the TX out of the flipover leather case I bought for it, which is a struggle. Luckily, the cable works without the cradle so the purchase wasn't a complete waste. If I'd paid list price for it, I'd have definitely returned it."
4,Nice Cradle,"It looks really neat on the desk and when the PDA is in the cradle, it almost looks like it's floating over the light. Yeah the light looks cool but is pretty annoying when the room is dark. I unplug it if it gets distracting."
4,Palm Charger,"Good product, can be used without the cradle, can be used to charge without the sync chord."
4,Should have come with the T/X,This is a great reliable way to sync. my palm. I don't know why this doesn't come standard with the new palm T/X. The light stays on all the time which means electricity is flowing. I recommend plugging into a power strip that you can easily turn off to save the greenhouse gas.
4,Cradle is nice... I find the light annoying,"I would suggest this to anyone who plunks down the cash for the Tungsten T5. The cradle is reasonably sturdy/heavy/unlikely to fall over when your PDA is sitting in it and looks reasonably nice on your desk. I also think it is much easier than messing around with the cheap adapter and USB cable which comes in the box.The only thing I don't like about it is the annoying light that is ALWAYS on! If you look in the picture, it is the light gray/non-silver part. It catches the corner of my eye and has been surprisingly distracting -- so much so that I have had to unplug it. Otherwise, I'd have to say it's great and give it all five stars!"
3,Style over function...,"The Palm cradle accomplishes the task you want it to: it syncs your Palm while propping it up. However, with no place for the stylus it is not as functional as the old cradle (Palm Vx). Palm touts the ever-glowing white light as fashionable, but it's not - it's polluting.All of that said, it's probably the best ""bang for the buck."""
5,Rev. Jerry Plotts,"Great bargain. I had it hooked up and syncing in less than 5 minutes. Staples has the same item for $50.00, so saving 50% for me was well worth it. The cradle light stays on, so that may bother some, but it does make a good night light at my desk. :-)"
3,Lifedrive cradle,"The cradle works fine. My one complaint is that the white light on it is always on, even when the computer is turned off."
5,Excelent product,"its very important to have a portable source of energy for using in long trips. It was very easy to find in Amazon.Amazon, simple and powerful. Thanks a lot to youRussell"
2,Poor quality cradle,"I bought this because the T5 is my fifth sucessive Palm PDA, and it did not come with a cradle. The device came with multiple plug adaptors and a universal power supply. The Cradle looks well and has a rather bright light, but the connections are very unreliable. The HotSync button is a poor quality item and frequently does not work. I find I am frequently just using the cable alone to synchronise."
4,tungsten e2 ipod cradle,"Received the cradle within 4 days of ordering it. The sync worked a few times. the charger works all the time. The main problem with the sync is not the cradle but the Tungsten software and the 64 bit vista operating system on my laptop. When I used the 32bit operating system on my desk top, the syncing worked fine. In the end I had to use the bluetooth operation to sync."
4,"On balance, a very useful product","The cradle is far easier to use than one or two cables that would otherwise be required. And it looks cool, which frankly counts for a lot. It is not nearly as well built or easy to use as the ""Universal"" cradles I bought for my Palm T3, and that's disappointing. Also the light is very annoying, what a horrible idea. On balance, since I love my Palm TX, and the cradle is a substantial improvement over dangling wires, I say go for it. THANK YOU Amazon for the substantial discount from list price.Art"
5,Palm Desk Dock,Does precisely what it says it will do. Backlit dock is a nice touch to make it easily locatable on the desk.
1,Cradle for Palm TX,"I did not feel this was a quality product. The Palm often did not fit in the cradle easily, and I had to press the hotsync button more than once before it made the connection. I eventually returned it."
3,Not quite what I expected,"The PDA actually sits well on top of the connector. Virtually all the mechanical strength of the connection is the actual electrical connection itself. I don't know how long it will last, but the Axim it's replacing had a better looking connection that actually failed twice within two years. So...hopefully this will be stronger and more durable than it appears."
4,A must for TX palm users,"Highly recommend this docking station for Palm TX (and other compatible Palms). It allows you to use the original sync cord for either an alternate computer...or even better yet when you take your palm on a trip. I have purchased three of these docking stations (yes, I have three computers and I sync on each of them!) One of the docking stations, however, has a sticky button. It does not work as easily as the other two. I called Palm for a replacement, but they would only do so if I sent in mine first (at my expense.) Because it was new I thought they should send me a return mailer, but they would not. This is the only reason I give the product four stars instead of five."
1,Cradle garbage,I've had the same problems as others. It freezes my TX. Took hours to figure out that it was the cradle. The Palm fix didn't work so now I'm back to the wire connection thing. A waste of money. Buy something else.
4,I love it!,I love the cradle because it will charge at the same time as syncing. The only thing I don't like about the cradle is the lack of support for the palm and the fact that I have to take my case off so that it can fit in the cradle.
3,A product that can be better,"It's a good product but the handheld can't be firmly attached to the cradle, it only sits on the connector and only this supports the device this result in a lack of balance and hotsync malfunction. The connection cables are the exactly the same that came with the handheld. So it could be included when you purchase a new Palm as it was with earlier models."
2,What a crock!,It looks very nice..but it doesn't work! Palm has identified a problem with the sleep/wake cycle and issued a patch..still doesn't work. Everytime you use the cradle it freezes the screen and then you have to reset the unit manually. :(
3,Palm TX freezes in the cradle,"The service was great. However, my Palm TX freezes about 60% of the time when I put in in the cradle, and I need to do a soft reboot. I do not, as of yet, have a fix from Palm."
4,I'd have given it 5 stars except for one irritating feature,"There is a light that ALWAYS stays on and it is distracting, as others have noted. Otherwise, it is great. Good design, works well, no complaints. But that light...WHY did they design it with that?"
1,Wait for the next edition,"Although published in '97, this book is already quite dated - the Mars and Jupiter system maps are based on Viking and Voyager data. Given the cost of this book, I'd wait until an edition came out which integrated the Mars Global Surveyopr and Gallileo data. Also, the detail of some of the maps leaves something to be desired - most of the locations listed in the Gazeeter are not marked on the maps. Finally, too much expository text is included (in a large type with generous spacing). I would have prefered these pages to be filled with more maps, rather than text I could have found elsewhere."
3,Love the show...too much of a range in the book.,"I absolutely love What Not to Wear on tv and I love Clinton and Stacey. That being said, I'm not so thrilled about the book. It covers every, and I mean every, different type of body in the book. Sounds great, but one ends up finding very little information that is specific to them.For example, one might have wide hips. There is a section devoted to this issue in their book. That section covers a few basics and that's really it. One might find a couple of other sections that apply to them, but the rest of the book wouldn't be helpful, unless looking up information for friends.Not a bad book and some nice ideas in there, but not very comprehensive."
3,Expected more,"Bought this book to gain ideas on the best look for my body type. I loved the concept of photographs of real people trying out various styles but the script is lacking in detail. I would have preferred a wider choice of clothes with colour coordination for each body type, accessories to match a look and various ways to wear an item to suit more than one occassion. I would also have liked advise on what to wear for each particular age group. So often we see younger women overdressed and older women dressed as ""lambs"". The book has humour, it is set out nicely. Reading it is fun. I did pick up some ideas but I felt I was getting too little. Obviously more detail would mean more printed text. That could be solved by publishing a book for men and women separately."
2,Not as good as I hoped......,"I love TLC's What Not To Wear TV program with hosts Clinton Kelly and Stacy London, but was somewhat disappointed in the book. While the book was well done with great photography and tips from the two, I found it a bit general for my purposes. I was looking for something a bit more specific to more than one perceived body flaw. And while it was interesting seeing all the models in their bathing suits, it may have been more appropriate to see them in Work / Weekend / Evening clothes of their own choosing before Clinton and Stacy got a hold of them."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Don't get me wrong, I love the show, however, if three pages of fashion advice is enough for you and for all of the places where clothes and fashion matter; i.e. work, school, beach, dates, out with friends, lounge around day, rainy season, snow season, sunny season, and everywhere in between, knock yourself out. Otherwise, I would highly recommend the Lucky shopping manual. Trust me, your money will be better spent."
4,if you want to look great at all times...,"this book is for YOU...Stacy and Clinton have been seen on my TV as long as ""What Not to Wear"" has been on TLC, and I've loved every moment of it...if you've seen the show, then you will get just what you see on TV in book form. I love the fact that there are pictures of each body type and suggestions for what to wear with those certain body types. Want to look your best? Then buy this book..."
5,Dressing Your Body Stylishly,"If you are a fan of What Not to Wear, you'll love having the stylists studyguide in your hands to see and review their advice whenever/wherever you like."
2,Incompleto,"Sinceramente no me gustó, a pesar que soy fanatica del programa, y a mi parecer el programa es bastante bueno, sin embargo el libro no lo es, las recomendaciones no me parecen acertadas en algunos tipos de cuerpo, además busqué el mio y solo puedes aprovechar 3 paginas, no más, las combinaciones y las propuestas no me gustaron, si quieres un libro de estilismo y con buen gusto recomiendo mejor alguno de los libros de Trinny & Susannah."
4,Clinton rocks <grin>,"Decent info, well presented. Pretty much a rerun of the show, but since I love the show... I also liked the book"
1,very disappointed,There was exactly 4 pages to read for my body type. Why do I have to pay for the rest of the pages?!
1,The best for body shape,"This is by far the BEST book I've seen showing how to dress for your body shape! It transcends age and occupation and really focuses on how to dress for your shape (curvy, bigger on the bottom, etc) and height...as in, not all plus-size women are petite."
2,justlookin_44,Hardly worth the money considering it is mostly a picture book. You can get the same information out of a newstand magazine for $2.00
4,"Love the show, love this book ....","I love the show and I love the book ... read the advice for what works and doesn't work for all the body types to create your own personalized list of rules. They pack a lot of good info in to each section. My style slipped in the past decade or so as I went for comfort and convenience. I still have comfort and convenience but I don't look like quite a ""Fashion Don't"" anymore."
4,Very interesting,"Many helpful tips that can be applied to all body shapes. Written with a sense of humor, making it enjoyable to read as well as informative."
4,Interesting and useful information,"I think they should have added a few more body types, and maybe some more goals for how you want to look. Still, the information behind their selections translates to some excellent advice. I got this for my wife and found myself enjoying it as well."
2,Not Much,"I was expecting this book to help me find out what body type I had and give me a good start to choosing clothes that fit right and certain things I should look for while looking for clothes that looked best on me. I was wrong. It had a total of 3 pages per body type, and on each page was just ONE single item to wear, and if your anybody you know that its impossible to wear the same thing for every occasion and not even the same look. This book took me a total of 10 minutes to get all i could possibly get from it and I only recommend it to someone who is desperate to find something that looks good, because most people can figure this out on their own."
1,Total waste of money,"The only reason I gave this one star is because I couldn't figure out how to give this NO stars. I love the What Not to Wear show, I really do, but this book did not give me ONE tip I can use. It's so padded it's not funny. The authors (whoever they are), really had to STRETCH to figure out what to write next to the few full page pictures they have in this tiny book. The clothes they choose to feature aren't even that attractive --and most of them are way too expensive for most people to be able to afford. Much better are the books by the British What Not to Wear ladies. I use their books all the time, especially their latest, which is chock full of things I never knew about how to dress and accessorize. (And I'm 45 and thought I knew it all!) Do yourself and a favor and give this American version a miss. I'm ashamed of Clinton and Stacy for putting out this drek, I admire them on TV but not in book form."
1,Sin Afan,"Sin afan de ofender puesto que yo soy uno y a mucho orgullo, este libro pareciera que esta escrito para latinos o afros es un libro muy tropicalizado sinceramente no me pondria nada de lo que recomiendan a menos que viviera en Miami y trabajara en Mcdonalds si buscas un buen libro para vestir compra algo de Kim Gross no te arrepentiras!!"
2,Limited in Scope,"I really wanted to LOVE this book since I am fan of the show, but I must be honest and say that once you find your own body type, the book is pretty useless. There is limited information on style itself (beyond body type) and limited information on where to shop, etc. You'd honestly come out cheaper going to a local bookstore (i.e. BORDERS), grabbing this book, looking up your body type, taking a mental snapshot of the info and putting the book back on the shelf because that's all you'll be able to do with it once you get it home.I will keep and use as a reference guide for friends and family with OTHER body types, but as a guide to consistently refer to over time, it is very limited. This is more of a BASIC BEGINNER's guide. Don't expect this one to be full of dog-eared pages from consistent use. The Lucky Style manual has MUCH more depth. If you're like me, and you rely on product reviews to help make purchasing decisions, take solace in the fact that I wouldn't steer you wrong."
2,"I had high of expectations, but was let down","This book should be purchased with friends of different body types. I will say that for my body type the book was informative, but when I picked up my next month's issue of a fashion magazine, they had the some stuff in it. For each body type, there are 6 pages total. 3 have bits of facts and the other 3 are pictures of the people. The book focuses on shape of clothing, but not really on color. YES, there is a section about men, but the body types that they list are very broad like Athletic, not athletic, skinny, husky. If you have $13.00 burning a hole in your pocket and you LOVE Stacy and Clinton, buying is up to you. I am going to stick with my fashion magazine subscription."
2,Not enough relevant content,"The book offers advice for very specific body types, but as a result, there were only 3 pages that are personally useful. I could have looked at this book at the library (not even checked it out) and gotten everything meaningful. Buying the book was a waste."
2,Better options elsewhere...,"Like everyone else, I bought the book because I enjoy the show and find a lot of their advice (even if it's not aimed at my particular body type or skin tone, etc.) to be interesting and helpful. Instead, what I ended up with was a picture book that only had 10-12 pages of relevant information for me. I'd like to see them do a book of outfit ideas. Say 12-15 possible work ensembles, business casual, weekend, beach, holiday and so forth. It's the grouping of various pieces, and their particular philosophy behind it, that seemed to be missing from the book. Disappointed all the way around..."
3,What Not To Wear,"Hey this was a great help. I still have some questions, but this helped me get through some of the issues I had and didn't have answers to regarding clothes. I don't know if you need to purchase, but check it out of the library by all means."
3,A little more content would have been nice.,"What made it a great book was the little information they gave you, granted they were chunking the entire (almost) population into a small coffee table book. I really liked what was there and can't wait to buy Stacy London's new book, but in all, about 4 pages were about my body type. I bought it used, so the price was definitely right. :)"
2,Not worth the cost,"I love the show , so I bought the book , but there really was only about 2-3 pages that really pertained to me , I could have read those at the local book store and saved the money."
2,"Love the show, but the book?","While I love the show and find it extremely helpful, the book was not. Once you find your body type, the rest of the book is a waste. I didn't find it helpful at all. The Lucky Shopping Manual is like a fashion bible! so much more helpful and explained what you needed to have a complete wardrobe."
5,Dressing for your body type,"I love the show TLC's ""What Not To Wear"" and this book really helps you figure out what sort of styles to look your best, given your body shape and more importantly, WHY these styles help correct and balance the proportion for a more pleasing effect. The examples are true-to-life and the attire featured is not outrageously priced, nor hard to find, as is often the problem in fashion publications. The photos are beautiful, the book is a quick read, the comments are fast and fierce - a nice resource to have on hand. A real treasure!"
1,A magazine article writ large,"Unless you have more than one body type, this book will give you a mere three pages of advice for how to dress. I was pretty disappointed. My fashion advice: don't pay for a whole book when you get a magazine article amount of information."
2,Tries to cover too much in too little space,"This book should either be longer or broken down into several different books based on shape. The attempt is nice, but I would rather read a book intended just for people shaped like me than six pages of a book for everyone."
2,I expected more...,"The book had some good advice...but most of the book is broken up into chapters based on body type. Therefore, the book had only one chapter (about 10 pages) on my body type (and the same amount for everyone else). It gave some good advice but I bought an entire book that I really only needed a very small portion of. Also, I didn't like any of the clothes that they picked for the model of my body type...petite curvey. I watch the their show...""What Not to Wear"" and love it. Just a little disappointed in the book."
2,Pay attention to the dissenting reviews!!!,"I love What Not to Wear, but I was very disappointed in this book, especially after reading the reviews. The In Style or Lucky Manual has much more useful information. While this book has information for all types of bodies for men and women, as well as a must have wardrobe list, it is seriously lacking because there will not be more than three pages that pertain to you. If you can borrow a copy from a friend or library, and then take notes on the tips, then do that - because buying the book is a huge waste of money. The information is so limited that will be of any use to one person that it quite simply is not worth buying."
3,Pretty Good But not Enough,"I am a big fan of the show and the book was wonderful but I found that it lacked specific recommendations for all categories of clothing. I would have liked them to be more direct and say buy these sorts of jeans, these kinds of shirts, these length skirts, etc etc. The glossary of terms was helpful at the end and the list of essential wardrobe pieces was great."
3,It's ok,"I bought the book because everyone on the show ALWAYS looked better after. I must say I was disappointed with this book. I read it once and haven't really looked at it since. I do like that there is a section for men where most style books don't have this, but like other reviewers say, if you aren't a specific body type.. you may still be scratching your head about what to wear. I guess I just wasn't very impressed with 3 total outfits pictured for each body type. I think I must be a visual learner. For me, the Lucky shopping manual was much more helpful."
1,Very disapointed!,"I LOVE to watch ""What Not to Wear"" and I expected the book to have more info. It literally has 4 pages of each body type and that is it. I definetly wanted more of a guide line for my body type."
2,What not to read,"I am a huge fan of the TV show but was very disappointed in this book.It took a total of 5 minutes to find my body type and height. They offer a few do's and don't and show you three styles for work, evening and weekend. Once you have read those 6 or 7 pages the books is done and is of no use anymore, just pass it on to another body type. . . very disappointing. I was hoping to get info on how to shop, where to shop, fabric info, cuts, designer who are best for me and designer secrets. Pretty much no new info."
3,Mediocre,It wasn't in quite as nice of a condition as I had thought it would be but it was okay I guess.
1,"Great Advertising, but.......","I was very excited to order and receive this product, with anticipation that my 45 yr old eye bags were going to diminish. After all, that's what the advertising bragged about. Um, not so much!! I applied Relastin faithfully and... NOTHING. My advice - don't waste $70 on this product. I wish I hadn't."
1,Waste money. It's not working at all.,"I bought this product and used it for over a month now. Nothing is working, it actually makes my eye bag and wrinkles even more visible. Don't buy this product. You are wasting your money!"
2,Doesn't live up to its promises,"I've been using this product for a little over four weeks and haven't noticed any improvement in my eyes, in either fine lines or dark circles. For a little background...I don't have real dark circles, but I'm getting wrinkly eyes when I smile. After searching for a product that would help improve the elasticity of the under eye area, I chose this product based on the good reviews, but have to admit that I see NO change in the elasticity of my skin. The only reason I give it two stars is because it does feel really silky on the skin when you put it on. I don't plan on buying this product again."
2,No better than anything else,"I've tried many many eye area products and this one is no better than any of the others. It feels really nice and ""silky"" going on your skin, but as for wrinkle appearance improvement....I didn't see any and I used it for about 3 weeks."
4,My Anti-Aging Amigo,"I'm rapidly approaching 30. I don't know if it's my kids, my job or just nature taking its course, but I've got a fine crop of wrinkles starting around my eyes. I just started using Eye Silk a couple of months ago and, let me tell you, it's helped a ton!"
1,Relastin Eye Silk,"I bought Relastin Eye Silk due to the fabulous reviews from Allure Magazine and other people. Relastin burned and dried my lower eye area out terribly. I looked horrible with dark red patches. My skin is normally not sensitive, and this really surprised me. There must have been an ingredient in the formula that I was allergic to. Fortunately I was able to make a return."
3,"Good, but too expensive","I've been a longtime subscriber, and the recipes are definitely worthwhile. However, in these economic times, the price no longer justifies maintaining the subscription. The latest $19.95 price is appealing; I've paid the full $25 in the past -- but we're talking only 6 issues a year, folks.There are also too many ""sponsored"" recipes (i.e., from groups like the Louisiana Sweet Potato Commission). I'm no longer feelin' the love."
5,Baby Beluga,"We love this book! With the accompanying CD of the same title, we can ""sing"" this book to our 11 month old twins which makes it unique in their minds. Now, after a few readings, they have started to say ""baby baby"" when they see the book or hear the baby beluga song."
5,Great,"Wonderful book and arrived very quickly. I have this book for my Son when he was young, now his son,my grandson, has his own. One for Grammies house and one for his house. He loves the song and will start to dance when you sing him the book."
5,Bedtime for two-year old,"Our two-year old son loves it when we sing this book to him, and we enjoy it, too. The illustrations are lovely and rich with details - lots of fun for families."
3,When???,"When can we Byrdmaniacs get a DVD compilation that includes all of the Byrds early appearances on shows like Ed Sullivan, Hullabaloo, Shindig, Big TNT Show, Ready Steady Go, etc? There must be some footage of the Byrds at Ciros or during their tour of England, something, ANYTHING with the original Byrd line-up? A worthy DVD is due for one of the most innovative and ground breaking rock bands there ever was. Until then, I guess this will have to do -- A somewhat sloppy scrapbook of some 70's era Byrd performances. Oh well."
1,Byrds DVD,"I agree with some of the statements already aired in that there is a real need for a comprehensive Byrds DVD to come on the market. There must be plenty of material around from TV shows/live gigs/festivals and long-time Byrds fans like myself have been crying out for something for years. Please can somebody, anybody, do something about this !"
2,worth seeing at least once,"Rick James never fronted the Byrds. He was in a Canadian band called the Mynah Birds with Neil Young, but never the Byrds."
3,Street self defense 101- multiple attackers,"The video is kind of cheesy, but the information seems to be right on with everything that I've personally learned about fighting. Don't expect fancy moves, you will not see them. As any one who has ever been in a really bad situation will know, unless you practice those fancy moves religiously, you probably won't use them. This is more like what the average person may do to fend off attackers: down to earth."
1,A Tree Died For This?,"How sad. 2 of my favorite authors, Debbie Macomber and Judith Bowen, participated in this very boring book. I didn't like any of the characters. Perhaps because these stories were shorter. but the protagonists personalities just didn't come thru. Plus the falling in love forever in 2 weeks or less just doesn't hold my interest.In all 3 stories, I kept waiting for something to happen. It never did. The 3rd story was the worst. My Secret Valentine should have been left on the editorial cutting room floor. What a mess. I like stories where I know what both sides are thinking. The heroine is of the TSTL variety and I wanted to slap her just about every other sentence.Dull, dull, dull describes this book and these stories fully. I know Ms. Macomber and Ms. Bowen can do much better. I'm not sure the other author has a clue on how to write an interesting story.Save your money unless you are a masochist."
5,Easy to install,This brace is particularly good if you can't get to the area above. I was pleased how the ends will attach into the wood beams to ensure good attachment. Just wish I found this years ago.
2,Plastic,"Did not like the plastic ends, went and bought another one from the local hardware store that was all metal"
5,Just what we needed,Need a brace for our heavy chandelier and these fit the bill perfectly. Very fast service and I am pleased with the brace
5,Caught a 2.75 Large Black Bass,The Zebco ZF200 CP4 Fish Finder does like it says. It will tell you if there are fish with in radar reach. Caught a 2.75 Large Black Bass the first day using it. Made believers out of my son and I.
3,belt,"came in on time, little hard to open, bit heavy, doesn't fit, ordered wrong size, guest belt size differs from this type, not fault of seller."
4,"A Nice, Simple Scale","This replaced an old Krups of similar design, which we dropped and broke. I find that the inverted bowl can slip sideways when removing the scale from the cabinet with one hand, so we are going to store this one in the box. If it were designed so that the bowl was more secure on the base, it would be even better, but my first loaf of bread looks great, so the scale did its job perfectly. I like it!"
2,Scale,"I'd have been a lot happier with this scale if for storage, once you turn the bowl over - it should snap onto the scale - it doesn't and ends up flopping all over the place - kind of a pain"
5,Best So Far!!,"This season was the best so far. If they keep improving on what they did during Season 2, this series will be around for a long time. Happy Fna."
3,What you need to know about Smallville,"The first season was prety decent by regular standars, but this season does not make much sense. I really like character development in a show, also sense of continuity and solid reasons/motives behind characters actions, and this show is laking just that. Its a fun series, just remember to shut down your brain in most of the episodes."
3,It's... OK,"I'm not a comic book purist who spouts off when Hollywood slaps long-time fans in the face. I'm used to it.I give the DVDs 3, 'cuz it's 50/50. Half are good, half aren't. I have a hard expecting something GREAT everyweek, so I take what I get. Considering that this is a Hollywood rendering of Clark growing up, that is geared to a 'Dawson Creek'-y teen culture, I think it's alright.If I want something better, I'll got buy the graphic novels. (Honestly, the books are ALWAYS better ;)"
4,Lionel Luthor - Evil,I'm smiling right now because Lionel Luthor is evil...even while lying in a hospital bed. Kudos to the creation of a great character...especially in this version of the Superman man story.
3,Second Season Smallville,"The year two is a continuation of the first. It reveals more and more about the Kent's and the town in general. It is of course a little hoaky and unrealistic, but entertaining."
4,smallville complete season two,I love the series it's something new each episode. the quality is excellent and amazon does a great job of getting it to you quickly and cheap.Highly recomend it.
4,Superly Done Season 2,"I think I am addicted to Smallville. I bought the first 5 seasons on DVD at one time and I was hooked at the first episode of season 1. Season 2 continues the saga of the coming of age Clark Kent aka Superman. It has some really good off the wall story lines as well as the continuing developing story line and relationships between the main characters - Clark, Chloe, Lana, Lex and Pete. All the seasons are good on their own but to get the full effect of Smallville you need to watch it from the beginning."
1,I don't receive this product yet!,"I don't know what happen whit my purchase, Already received the third season of smaville. It's bought on the past week but the second season until not I receive.To that number I can call to review that passage with my purchase?My telephone number is 00-52-998-2092146 by any thing."
3,"Smallville, the show that ruined Superman","This is not the real story of Clark Kent in his early years, most of the episodes are made up. And the use of the green kryptonite is getting a bit too stupid. When this show first aired on CBS, i thought that the major incidents that happened in Clark's life would be shown, but they just had to destroy it. This is not the story of Clark Kent, it's a story of just a man strggling in his freakin' teen years tryin to get a girl but he can't and befriends a bald rich guy who doesn't even know hos role in life. As far as i'm concerned, the show should be called 'Stupidville the boring pointless years'"
1,smallville season 2,"Got my package fast, but when i tried watching disc six of the smallville series the disc was not readable.."
5,smickey,"Item is in good condition , no scratches, case in good shape . I rate them 5 stars and would order from them again."
3,Bad Case,"Case wasn't in as good of shape as the ad said. One disk didn't work because the case wouldn't hold it in place. Though a good deal, I got a broken case that ended up ruining a DVD before it got to me."
3,Smallville Second Season,"I received it fast, but the case was in bad shape. When I opened it everything just fell out. Disc are in ok shape."
3,Addictive,"Still in love. I hate the theme song, am throughly sick of the meteor rocks and the annoying love triangle. But I keep coming back for more, I definitely consider it worth watching (and buying) even if I don't love everything about the shows. So far they keep you interested, can't wait to get next season."
5,A more interesting focus in the second season,"After a rather superficial season one (with a an evil counterpart possessing some superpowers), the creators of the show kind of got to the more interesting aspects of the story: the relationship between Clark and Lana. And I think they were successful. Together with these developments, the series became much more intense and interesting, the highlight being in episode #222 ""The calling"", when Clark finally showed his feelings for Lana. The relationship between the two teenagers has also been supplemented by some great score music by Mark Snow. All in all, this season entirely overshadowed the first season, in terms of storyline, humor, excitement and, most importantly, relationship."
3,The case was ripped apart.,"The DVDs worked great! However, the case thing it came in is barely holding together. I guess the main part of this purchase was the disks, but I was still a little dissapointed on the shape the case was in."
4,Surprisingly entertaining,I'm very much enjoying the Smallville episodes and Season 2 is still excellent. I may wear out before I get through Season 10 and I'm already wishing they wouldn't graduate since upcoming seasons look more extra-terrestrial which I'm not crazy about. Most long running series get strange as they go along just from running out of ideas along the original theme. We'll see!
5,Our Favorite Season of Smallville,"We have purchased all of the smallville seasons and were are currently on season 8, however this was our favorite season. I love these characters and they truly come alive in season 2! Buy all the seasons, it is a great family show (for children age 11+). We love smallville!"
4,Smallville: Second Season,"The second season of Smallville continues where the first one left off; with Clark's friends in danger. After a conclusion is reached to that climax, the running storyline throughout the season delves into Clark's origins: Who is he? Where did he come from? What exactly is the ship? And who are his parents? All of these questions culminate in the season finale, which is a must-watch for fans of the show."
4,If you're a fan; you know it just gets better with every season.,"If you're new to Smallville, don't feel left out, it sometimes takes a while for people to figure out what it is. Oh, and you better start from the beginning. Hope you have Season 1 already! Smallville Season 2 (whoa): better than Season 1 (cool), not as good as Season 3 (ooo) or 4 (holy crap)...but hey, they just keep gettin' better :D"
2,"Low quality, hard to use and too expensive","This item dissappointed me very much. The construction is flimsy and cheap, the headphones are too large for a child's head - my adult headphones fit her better. Everything about this screams cheap and poor design. You have to remove 6 tiny screws just to change the batteries. Please do yourself a favor and buy another brand. This is not worth your time or money."
3,Riffs for days but not much else,"This is the inaugural burning water CD, which I purchased while in Germany when it first came out. I agree with the prior review about the riff-dominated songs. If you are a guitar player, the limpidity of Landau's playing in the blues-rock vein will be enjoyable and somewhat humbling, but the songs are weak and vocals poor. Landau's forte is well-honed rock tone and here he tries in a way to surmount his own taste and to play rawer than his own technique can allow. There are a lot of notes and very little structure. This must have been an LA thing back then, when studio guys like Landau were trying to prove that they could 'go street'. Three stars for the guitar, but it's important to be realistic. If your favorite Richard Thompson or Jeff Beck disc is 5-star, then this is surely at most 3-star material."
4,Great CD-ROM,What made this book a good one was the templates and tutorials. It has everything to help you get on your way to designing your own web pages.
4,A good starting point for new people to the HTML language.,"I found the tutorials useful. This is the first time I ever bought a book on CD. I liked the templates, they gave me ideas."
1,Bad seller,"I had this book and it disappeared. I loved the book and hunted for a long time for another one. I have Cross Stitched many sweatshirts for the men in my family and a few friends from the patterns in this book. Everybody loved them. However, I didn't get to buy it off Amazon. The person that put it up for sale on Amazon.com sent me a message that they didn't have it after all. I had also found a copy of the book of another site that I had to look up. I did get a copy from the other site and at a lower cost."
1,If I could give it a lower rating I would.,"This is possibly the most horrible book I have ever read. I finished it, just because I kept thinking that it might get better. This is the first book I read by this author, and I have to say that I will never read another one. Books that I think are really terrible are few and far between, but this one may be the absolute best of the worst."
4,Another book for Rabbi Small fans,"If you are like me and read all of previous Rabbi Small books, you will be happy that there's another one. Though this wasn't as fun as the others, it was still an enjoyable reading.If you have never read Rabbi Small mystery before, I strongly suggest that you start with his first book. This way you can truly enjoy his books. I got hooked and I had to read every book he wrote"
2,Slow...,"Rabbi Small resigns from the synagogue in Barnard's Crossing and takes a teaching job in Boston. The new rabbi takes over, and becomes accused of murder when a professor from the college is found dead next to his property. This is the same person who was caught peaking in the window the of the rabbi's bedroom when just his wife was at home. Rabbi Small ends up figuring out who was guilty of murdering the professor. Slow book, and the murder doesn't even take place until over halfway in the book."
2,Pleasant but plodding rabbi mystery -- there are better choices,"I suppose the ""Rabbi mysteries"" are popular and well-known, so I thought I'd try another. I'm even from Massachusetts, so it's pleasant to recognize the places (both real and made-up). But Kemelman just takes too long to set all the pieces in place, with the only spice being some beginner-level explanations of Judaism. The ending is clever and unpredictable -- I'll give him that. But if you've got a few hours to spend on murder mystery, and want something up-to-date, skip the Rabbi and go for Monk."
1,Very disappointing work from an author I enjoy.,"Let me begin by saying that my edition of this book had 263 pages. The murder occurred on page 166. Much of what went on before could have been omitted. Mr. Kemelman's last few books have not been up to the standards he established with his first few. When he began, his books were tighter. The character expositions seemed more plot-driven. With this book, there is just exposition. Rather than read this book, read (or re-read) ""Friday the Rabbi Slept Late""."
3,"Good Moisturizer, Not Helpful for Fine Lines","This is a package of three products: A daily serum, a daytime moisturizer and a nighttime cream. You use the daily serum in the morning with the daytime moisturizer and then at night you use the daily serum again with the nighttime cream. I love the daily serum, I like the serum texture which is a clear fluid not a cream and smells wonderful. The daytime moisturizer isn't unlike others that I have used, a light lotion with UV protection. The nighttime moisturizer is a heavier cream. If you are looking for a new skin regiment, I would recommend them as moisturizers but haven't noticed a real difference in my fine lines. I did notice a difference in the general appearance of my skin, it seems to look smoother. I think an added wrinkle cream for around the eyes is necessary too."
3,Great opportunity to try the Regenerist line,"I was really happy to have an inexpensive way to try the regenerist skin care line. I use some other skin care items by Oil of Olay and have been intrigued by the regenerist products.The set includes the UV defense regenerating lotion, deep hyration regenerating cream, and daily regenerating serum.The tubes include clear instructions for use, including when to use, and in what order to apply the products. The tubes include enough product to get a good idea as to whether or not it will work for you.It has a very nice scent and feels good on the skin.Unfortunately, I did not find great benefits from the product. In all fairness, I have very difficult skin and it has taken a lot of experimentation and a mix of products to come up with a routine that works for me. I was glad I didn't have to buy full bottles in order to try the line."
3,It's OK,"I wanted to try these products to see if all the hype was true. I didn't notice much of a difference except my skin felt drier and the one with the sunscreen made me break out. I think if you don't need a lot of moisturizer then this is a nice, cheap skin cream."
1,Royal Philharmonic Orchestra Plays the Music of REM,None of the tracks on this album were worth the $15 I spent. It sounded as if it had been performed by one man laying down several tracks with a synthesizer rather than an orchestra. Extremely disappointing.
2,"Good product, but not good for classroom","I do like this product, however for my needs, it is not sufficient. I am a first grade teacher and the major downfall with these mailboxes is that the the slots in which the paper is to go into is in no way secure. They are propped up by four little metal pegs and are easily knocked off the pegs by my students when getting their papers. They then have a difficult time putting them back on the pegs. I also feel the black plastic strip where the labels are supposed to go is way to small. Not even the labels that come with the product fit well on the black plastic strip.My product was also a little nicked in places due to delivery. One wooden piece had the corner snapped off. I was able to call customer service (Discount Office Items) and they sent me a new piece with no problem.After spending at least $100 dollars on this product, I'm sad to say I will go back to using my cardboard Classroom Keepers mailboxes that were actually perfect for the job!"
2,Not so great for classroom use,"As a literature organizer used by adults, this might be fine. However, I bought this about three years ago to use as the student mail center in my first grade classroom. It has held up all right, but it's frankly not ideal. First of all, papers fit inside the compartments but folders do not, so the students have to bend them to make them fit, which is a bit of a challenge at the beginning of the year. (Eventually, they get the hang of it.) The area to label the compartments is really small, so you have to tape on labels that hang down and invariably fall off. Worst of all for me, the shelves sit on pegs and aren't fixed in place, so they're constantly sliding out when a student takes out his folder at the end of the day. So, I'm going to repurpose this as a paper center and spend more of my own money (sigh) on a new mail center with fixed compartments large enough to accommodate folders."
1,Not enough pegs included in package,Granted this thing sat unopened for way too long. When got around to assembling it there was not enough pegs for the unit. I have no idea who to contact about this. Plus I hate even having to waste my time on stuff like this. I have no complaints other than that the product is just as advertised.
4,solid construction,"this organizer has good, solid construction. it's very dense particle board covered with the usual veneer. the shelves are a good quality masonite cut to fit the compartments, and the shelf pegs are an attractive antiqued red brass color. My only gripe is that there are holes for 60 compartments and I would have liked more pegs. I've emailed the company to see if I can order them separately and will update my review if they are flexible enough to do that."
1,Description is wrong,"This is the listed Product Description:Make your work life E-Zier! Quality-built, premium steel unit has a strong steel frame, shelves and dividers with a solid fiberboard back. Interlocking design of the shelves and dividers add extra strength to hold up to the heaviest load. Wide shelf fronts serve as generous label holders. Unit features 72 letter-sized compartments. Each compartment will hold up to 750 sheets.Scroll up and read the specifications published directly above the product description. It says it's made out of wood.Houston, we gotta' problem. (reason why I gave it one star. The actual product, made out of wood and which I bought a month ago, is great.)"
4,Very happy with this product,"I really had a hard time spending $100 on this item to organize my office area at work, but now that it has arrived and I have put it together (very easy) I am very happy that I did spend the money. This item looks good and is very, very sturdy. I can't tell you how many times I was on the brink of ordering a cheaper paper sorter, but didn't because reviewers revealed how flimsy the items were. It is clear that this item will be with me throughout my work life and beyond. I will be ordering another soon. Why four instead of five stars? The cardboard backing. It's just plain old cardboard. I wish the back was made of the same product as the shelves."
4,"Safco Products Wood Adjustable Literature Organizer, 36 Compartment, Oak.","This product was easy to assemble. Price of the product seemed reasonable; however, shipping price was high. Plenty of compartments to handle my business needs at the moment. Didn't really care for the labels that came with it. I used a labeling device to make professional looking labels for each mail slot. If needed, I will certainly order this product again."
5,Great storytelling,I was raised in the community in this book and know the places and faces very well. This is a very fun and comfortable read. The author will warm your heart immediately with the recollections of his youth and how this summer was a turning point for him. He looks back with a twinkle in his eye. I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.
4,great heroes of the sky,"This documentary, clearly exemplifies the great courage needed tho complete every mission, i do not think that today you can find people that can do this kind of flying, because it took a lot of guts, just to climb one of those planes and cope with the limited technology that existed in that era, and the ods of returning safetly where not that great, and you were aware of it because you saw a lot of your friends die in every mission, and a lot af brave crews where also lost, somethimes a crew was aware that it was going to die in a mission that had no return, but the value of fredom gave them the suficient forcr to push forward."
5,Good product.,I have a large yard so I love these balls. If you do not have a large yard these are not the balls for you. These balls go alot farther than any other practice ball I have ever hit. My average drive is about 290 yards and I carry these balls about 110 yards. Also I can hit my 5 iron 75 yards. If you do not have a big yard you will be losing golfballs.
5,Highland Ramps,"I compared this product with others. I looked at metal and some that I could make out of wood. I like the fact that they arch which makes it easier for loading my riding mower, which by the way weights about 700 pounds.The ramps are sturdy and easy to handle. The sides help keep my front tires from going off the ramps and there are ridges to provide traction for the tires. I do a lot of research before I buy and I like these ramps a lot. The vehicle that use the ramps on is a Ford F150 and my mower is a Wright Sentar Sport 36"" cut."
3,Mower deck cannot get past raised edge when at top of ramp,"I have a Craftsman 20hp 42"" cut mower. When trying to load it onto my 04 F150 4x4 the mower deck gets stuck on the raised edge at the top of the ramp. Yes, I have the deck all the way up. I bought these for the longer length and I thought the raised edge would be helpful. I'm not sure what to do now. I have had them too long to send back. Also, they are very heavy. If I had it to do over again I would take my $233 and find something better."
1,Very disappointing!,"You know you're in trouble when a cookbook begins with ""Please don't expect exact cooking terms because I don't know any."" If you really are a novice cook, and don't know how to make a chef's salad (cut up lettuce and add deli meat, grated cheddar and some veggies) or a tortilla pizza (put pizza sauce and cheese on a tortilla), you might find this book helpful. Otherwise, you'll probably find it very disappointing."
4,Good Pencils,"These are great mechanical pencils for everyday use. Too bad they don't sell them in drug stores like they used to. These are harder to find now, which is probably why they are so overpriced here :("
2,Looks good. Bad performance,"This is a high price for 6 pencils. A 4 pack at Staples is $4. They look nice, but dont relly work that well. A retractable pencil needs to be well made to perform. Get a fixed point if you want a quality experience. Otherwise you will need to spend more for a good vanishing point."
5,Toucan puzzle,My family had so much fun putting this impossible puzzle together. Many man hours but the final was well worth it!! Bravo.
5,We loved it!!,"My daughter had received a bank like from a friend for her birthday when she was younger and her brother who is autistic accidentally broke the wheel off, we were thrilled to be able to replace it for her for a reasonable price."
4,Very cute!,Got this for my 2 year old who loves George...wouldnt hold up to him playing around with it...so i keep it on a shelf...so cute though!
3,Solar Timer,"This good and works with incandescent, halogen or fluorescent others dont so if you want to run energy saver style bulbs this is the one. I only gave it 3 stars as the front panel I feel will break and there is limited programing compared to others and no security (random mode)etc"
4,Just one suggestion for improvement,"I really like this product. It came with clear instructions and installed easily. Programming was easy. I just wish this timer could be set to turn on a set number of minutes AFTER sunset, and turn off a set number of minutes BEFORE sunrise. I find that the lights turn on while there is still quite a bit of daylight and don't turn off until it's been light for 30-40 minutes. Other than that, It's a great product. The change from standard to daylight time involves only a few button presses, just don't lose the instructions because the procedure is not intuitive."
2,"Worked well at first, but died too soon.","I've used this switch for the past year and a half or so, and it did work well. Unfortunately, it just died and now I can't even turn the light on manually. I assume that the internal battery is dead, but looking inside, I see that it is soldered in so not readily replaceable.For the price, I would have expected more than the time I got out of it. It also would have been better if the switch could still be used as a manual switch once the battery runs out. Now, I have to shell out another 35[...] to get a new switch. It didn't save me that much money in electricity over its short little life."
5,Nice little gizmo for my outdoor lights,"I love these switches! I bought three of them and they've worked great for 4 months now in turning my front and back porch lights on/off. The solar timer leaves a little to be desired as it turns the lights on about a 1/2 hour too early and a 1/2 hour too long in the morning. But I bypassed the solar feature and manually programed it to the time I want. I just update it once a month or so. Very easy to program. How long they will hold up I don't know, but these are doing the job for me now. I can go out at anytime and not worry about the outdoor lights coming on. They're shining bright when I get home. Just need some basic wiring exprience to install these. Not hard at all. I highly recommend them."
1,Download this book for FREE,This book is out of copyright and therefore free to download at archive.org and other places on the internet. The introduction may be the only new addition to this book.
4,Hubble: 15 Years of Discovery has fascinating information,"I was very pleased with information in this movie and how it was presented. The animations and images were fascinating. My kids and I watched it together, and we all learned a lot about both the Hubble and the history of the universe. The narration was a bit dry at times, but the soundtrack livened things up and added a lot to the film."
3,A potentially great job dumbed down,"I give it 3 stars ONLY because of the overwhelming beauty of the pictures shown. But the production of this DVD is at a very low standard. For the slightly interested layman like me there wasn't bit of new information. Not to mention differing cosmological theories (electric universe versus gravitational/ big bang etc.) The speaker was boring to the max, he is probably a scientist with very few social skills. It would have been better to hand a script to a professional speaker who may even had more enthusiasm while he is explaining the unfolding of the universe.Its the standard model for highschool kids."
2,Amateurish and trivial,"The production quality and narration of this video is amateurish. I wanted to see a lot of spectacular photos and videos made by hubble, but there wasn't much of that. Instead, this video is mostly comprised of basic information about the hubble and basic general astronomy. It's actually pretty dissapointing. I thought that there would be so much more to see, since hubble is supposed to be the best telescope."
2,Some Critical Data Missing,Perhaps I expected too much from this book. There are three long chapters (166 pages) on updating the data base. What is missing is information and examples on handling the inevitable errors that can occur. Too much time is spent on inept ways developers approach design and not enough time on making a good approach (timestamp) robust by defining appropriate error handling methodology. I typically reuse good examples in my code but I have not found a single routine that I can put into production code.
5,Excellent,"I am a programmer by profession. I knew very little about ADO.Net. After reading this book, I am very comfortable with the material and can now write an ADO.Net application easily.This book is easy to understand, explanations are thorough, and examples are complete and to the point."
5,Lots of practical advice,"I got this book a few days back and since then I have been completely immersed in Sahil's lucid and understandable presentation style. He takes one of the most important parts of .NET and presents it in simple and understandable concepts broken down by task oriented chapters. I really like the number of practical tips and tricks, real world scenarios, and the lots of accompanying code available in this book. What I like the most is his easily understandable presentation style. I find myself glued to the book, coming back, turning page after page. I think finally I've found a good well balanced book on ADO.NET."
1,Not a good book,"When I first read others' review, I thought it's a good book about ADO.Net 2.0. But after I bought, I found it is difficult to read. It is not well organized. It is one of worst books I ever bought."
5,Sidhe suprise!,One of the best books about the Sidhe (Celtic Elven and Faerie kin) ever created. As a big fan of Celtic myth and legend I loved these books. A must for anyone who loves Lackey or ever wanted to be an elf.
3,Brilliant concept but ...,"Brilliant concept, but Lackey pulls the same trick here that she does in many of her other novels -- lots and LOTS of exposition that ultimately slows down the plot. Pages and pages of descriptions of streets, of trees, of car racing engines, followed by chapter-long discussions between characters in which each quote is half a page long. Who really speaks like this? And who really wants to sit still and read that much overblown dialogue?But when Lackey gets down to brass tacks, her action and magery sequences are edge-of-your-seat entertaining and absolutely top-notch. I just wish there were more of those and less talk.If you liked this novel, you'll love ""Chrome Circle,"" which follows Tannim in a life-or-death adventure Underhill. You'll probably also get a kick out of Lackey's Diana Tregarde novels, including ""Children of the Night"" and ""Jinx High."""
1,"Moral irresponsibility, whee!","The basic plot is, child prostitute who's seriously into unicorns meets nice wizard (in a bar); wizard gives her money, says ""make your own magic,"" and stresses constantly that magic can't fix your problems; child prostitute is angst-ridden, shot at, and kidnapped for two-hundred-fifty pages; child prostitute is touched by her unicorn and suddenly her abusive parents are saints and everything's quite all right.At once point, child prostitute's internal monologue explains that escapism is a myth and she reads fantasy to find *solutions*.Hopefully child prostitute never reads this book.(Oh, and there's also some stuff where evil elves make porn films by kidnapping other child prostitutes and taping monsters raping/eating them, if you're into that. We even get to sit in on a brainstorming session. And good elves playing with racecars, as usual.)"
2,Barely readable.,"Somebody didn't allow page space for the binding, consequently (unless you ripped the book apart) half the sentence on every left page disappeared into the binding as did half the sentences beginning on every right page. Luckily I have other books to corroborate and add to the story being told."
1,Horrible cliched piece of crap,"Even though I am 22 I like to read young adult novels sometimes and this one had a great premise (or so it seemed from the back cover). Too bad it was executed horribly. It was trite; it was boring; it was even offensive. The man character kept calling junior police officers ""Narcs"" which is offensive when you figure how many police officers have died in the line of duty. THe characters are carcitures, plain and simple. I didn't even bother to finish it. DON'T BUY THIS WHATEVER YOU DO! It was a total waste of hard-earned cash!"
1,Cheap cheap cheap,"This mirror looks great in the picture. And for 200+ dollarsi expected it to be a heavy durable metal frame and pedestal. It is a cheap, plastic, item. I would say its about a 30 dollar item. I am returning it for a refund."
4,"Great looking mirror, but on the expensive side","Unlike the other reviewer, I think this looks quite nice. I suppose I don't have much experience with these kinds of mirrors to compare it to, but I've had my bronze vanity for two years now and I really like it. I haven't had to replace the light and have not noticed any paint chips or anything since I've had it. It's pretty sturdy and has a 2 prong plug on the base which I haven't had to use, but is a nice feature for those that might be light on outlets and use lots of electronic ""equipment"" in the bathroom. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star review is because it does carry a hefty price tag which might be a deal-breaker for a lot of people. However, I have to say I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and would buy it again. I would also like to point out that when I purchased this I was expecting more of an oil-rubbed bronze look. This one, however, appears more like a solid black color."
5,Gut wrenching depth of emotion.,"This poetry shows where this man has been, and that he not only is not afraid to admit it, but he never wants to forget it. It explores the deep emotions that many feel, but few wish to revisit if it can be avoided. I think it is a brave facing of issues and situations and SELF, and at the same time a finding of self, viewed through the media of poetry. Gritty at times, strength giving at others, and definitly not for the weak of heart. Be ready to face your own self before you open the pages....."
4,Just wow...,I was lucky enough to get a an autographed copy of the book online and wow....the first poem gets you and for me really held my attention. There were some i didnt like as much but over all it is a great read. If you have the extra cash its worth purchasing this book.
4,"Life, as viewed through an amber colored bottle...","This is an incredibly hard edged, raw collection of poems from an obviously difficult time in Mr. Easton's life. Even through the haze of alcohol and/or drugs, he still felt the pull of the written and spoken word, and was able to project that life to us in an eloquent, albiet blunt, way. I truly hope to see more poems from Mr. Easton, this time from a perhaps more sober and introspective view. My favorites are Poem 37, Pictures, Tantalus and Love Letter. Bravo, Mr. Easton, and thank you.(A word of warning - the rawness and crude language of many of the poems are not for everyone, please keep that in mind. Even still, it's a great book of poetry and may remind many of their youthful party days)."
5,Very Interesting soul searching,"I am a huge fan of Michael Eastons, have been for a few years. Reading this book, which Iwas lucky to get off eBay, I haveto say there is a great deal of pain in there, but some poems I laughed out loud at. I know thatI will be reading this book many more times--I liked it very much."
2,Honest and Real Poetry,"I usually like more traditional poetry, Donne, Keats, Shelley, but Michael Easton has written a beautiful, real and honest book of poetry about his life. It is not all hearts and flowers but very powerful and moving nonetheless. I hope he finds the time and the muse to write another book of poetry. His honesty and truth were quite refreshing."
4,No Secret,"All the soft-headed New Ageies who fell for The Secret and believe that quantum physics proves that thinking happy thoughts will make you rich need to read this book to get a clue. This book is targeted at children, which is perfect for the New Ageies."
5,best folk implosion yet,I bought this record when it first came out in the early 90's and I loved all 25 minutes of it. I can't tell you how many times I have jigged to Sputnik's Down and wiggled to Slap Me. Would love to hear more of this from Mr. Barlow and Mr. Davis.
1,Moody Blues EP,The only good item on the DVD was the Nights in White Satin and that is available on the Legend of a Band DVD. I was very disappointed. The cover artwork is very misleading. It makes you think that you will see more of the later Moodies Music.
1,"Moodies great - rest not worth the $$$, not even 1 Star","This is a lot of money to spend on a minimal Moodies exposure. I was very disappointed and it makes me hesitant to purchase any like items for Amazon or any other on-line vendor. The system needs a ""0"" Star option for true review!Let the Buyer Beware!"
