4,I've Never...the Game of Truth,Tons a fun for adults! The board game has a few warm up questions and then some naughty questions! In addition there are about 4-6 blank cards that you can write in your own truth or dare questions!! This game was THE HIGHLIGHT happy hour w/the ladies
1,too expensive,"When I bought the book however, I thought that the content would make upfor the price... not so. A lot of the information in the book I had already foundonline. The interviews in the ""book"" aren't all that indepth and again merely restates what is already in the book (or what you may know from having done some searching online yourself). In fact the whole book seems to restate the same things over and over again).But to be fair, there was some good information."
1,Not worth a hundred bucks!,This book is overpriced and outdated. Much of the information about search engine algorithims is not in line with the current standards in the industry. Not worth the high price tag!
2,It is polypropelene. Made me sweat.,"It was on the bed for three days before it came off. Couldn't sleep because I was soaked. At first I though I was experiencing early menopause. What a relief when I took this off the bed. Is this a problem with ALL allergy mattress covers? I sure hope not!Easy to put on the bed, easy to take back off..."
5,"Strip, Baby Strip!",Genius! QA is the real deal folks! Great musicianship paired with stellar vocals! Please Tour the U.S.!!!!!
3,overprice,"seller was fast...no problems with them. item is overprice, stand probably made for another bb model, a little big for my bb8300 curve. car,travel adapters worked well. should be selling for somewhere 10-15$"
2,Not what is expected,"I ordered this and took it to work to share with my Chinese co worker who drinks green tea all day, she said its fake and that its not the good stuff. It does not taste that great and looks different than the picture shows."
3,cheap green tea,Fairly cheap mediocre green tea from china. The flavor is not bad but not special. Needs strained when poured. Almost certainly not authentic DragonWell.
3,al little too powdery,Leaves are easy to be broken and slipped out of strainer. fresh enough.tastes good enough. not so storng.
4,A surprisingly enjoyable read.,"I hadn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did. Bentz's characters seem real, especially Hugh, the crusty old father whose illness is the hub of the story. The writing draws its power from a focus on unsentimental and believable characters reminiscent of so many people we know, too often even ourselves."
4,Great Character Study,"""If you won't take me home, then I'll get my other family to do it"" are the words that starts off this well-crafted character study by Joseph Bentz. Each chapter is written by a different member of Hugh Morris's two families, himself included. His current wife, Vonnie, knew, but kept it a secret. His three daughters knew nothing of the son and daughter he had nor the first marriage that produced them. The son and daughter from the first marriage knew little or nothing about their father. When they all meet, there are sparks, there are tender moments, and we watch the progression to a melding of the two families. While it seemed to drag a bit in the middle, the ending was heartwarming and had a lesson for all."
1,So so,"Not as good as I had hoped-- it was ""put down able"". As a hospice nurse I had hoped for a little more insight but no such luck...."
4,Good Product,"Hardware was good, packaging was poor, when it arrived the box was a broken out and had be re taped in transit.They just put hardware in box and shipped it.lucky part was pretty sturdy and was not too badly damaged just little bent up but usable.This was sold be amazon shipped by someone else."
3,glaring omission,"Nice collection, but conspiciously missingis his signature song: That Lucky Old Sun.And, on this CD at least one of his bestknown songs: Moonlight Gambler is a poorad-libbed rendition that does no justiceto the original recording on Columbia."
4,Granddaughter likes it,My Granddaughter likes this book and I can't say one way or the other because I have not read it.
4,Fun,"It has lots of good ideas for keeping it together, the author is in tune to today's teen, I think my niece will enjoy it."
3,full of great advice but...,"what she writes in order to console teenager girls penetrates only the surface. i think the author needs to realize that adolescent girls that actually read don't need anything dumbed down for them, as this book has done."
4,Easy to read good advices!,"This book includes short and valuable message for young girls. The easy, flowing style and the short pointed messages attract the attention of our girls, who don't have the patience to read through long articles and complicated messages. I was harsh judging Ms. Ford's new book because I was comparing it to the book that she co-wrote with her mom: ""between mother and daughter"". However; given Amanda's young age, the content of her messages, and the likable style absolutely redeemed this work in my eyes."
3,Young author,"I would not have purchased this book had I known it was written by a 21-year-old. Having said that, I have two 14-year-old granddaughters who receive NO beneficial information on maturing, sexuality, dating, etc., from their parents. I left this book in their bedroom at my house, and they asked me, ""Is that book for us?"" I said yes, and they responded, ""That's good, because we have been reading it."" They seemed to like it, so it is a useful tool for stimulating discussion at the very least."
1,Not Impressed,I purchased this book for my daughter 13 yrs old. I could of done with out the buddah prayer within it.
4,Pleasant light entertainment,"These are fun. A remarkably young Roger Moore takes on a variety of villains in this crisp black-and-white set. The video transfer is excellent and the monophonic sound good. Now, nobody has ever accused The Saint of being highbrow entertainment, and these early episodes are no exception. ""Danger Man"" is more intelligent, while ""The Avengers"" are more offbeat. I enjoy them all for what they are."
3,is ok,"I didn't care for a quesadilla I made I think I could have done better in a pan or griddle. Maybe I left them in too long 20 min. Too dry.But I did like the corn dogs I made with corn muffin mix and hot dogs - 10 min. I bought this machine because my grandkids are coming for two weeks this summer. Just for making the corn dogs alone it is worth it to me. So far that is all I have made. There is NO RECIPE BOOK that comes with the machine, so I had no idea on how long to cook the quesadillas. It CLEANS UP REAL EASY that is a PLUS."
3,Not for thin sandwiches,"Love the look of it and it does work ok; I find if the sandwich is thin, it doesn't toast all that well. If you try to cook it longer, the middle slant will be hard and burnt. So if you're trying to eat leaner better forget this one."
5,No-mess and loved by guests @ my cocktail party,"Used these for a 50 person party, and multiple people loved them! I combined them with bamboo ""boats"" in the 4.5 inch variety to serve appetizers with less labor time spent on making them bite size--it allowed me to serve family style! awesome."
2,"Work for a while, then its a gamble.","[...]Plenty of cautionary tales for the 6V Porsche owner.I myself have had three, and that third one was the last I'll ever own.They work really great when they work (I gave it three tries!) but when they fail they'll leave you dead at the side of the road. The first failure was <300 miles after installation. Luckily, I was skeptical and kept my original points in my glovebox. The second time it failed more gradually, and I got home, but again swapped back for the points. Third time I got one as a gift. Pertronix II 91847AN6. It worked for <100 miles. Then the voltage threshold was too high and my car wouldn't start.I have friends with 12V systems that swear by them. Race cars, VWs, 356es driven in Mojave desert heat. All worked fine. You pays your money and you takes your chances."
3,I would pass on this book!,For the first 140 pages the main character dealt with rude and mean daughter and mother. I was ready to give up on the book at that point. Then the book did a turn around and Carly found her voice and decided to fight for her life. She has to save her B&B and make the cute ghostbuster believe that Mary the ghost is real. I was just getting into the story and then it stopped....
3,There is always a plan B,"I normally like the books that susan mallery writes, but I thought this one was not up to her standard. It was OK. And I was really bored so I read it. But, some of the situations were not as believable as could be. However, her relationship with the daughter and the ex-husband were good."
3,Back to Plan B,I alway enjoy reading anything Sasan Mallery writes. But I was disappointed in this one she left you hanging at the end. What happened with her teenage daughter? tHE 2 new men in her life?
1,So disappointed,I have read quite a few Susan Mallery books. What a huge disappointment. I was literally mad when I finished. She leaves so many loose ends in this book. What happens to the men in her life? Does the brat of a daughter get her act together? DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! 0 stars in my opinion but you have to give at least one.
4,HI: A Very Good Magazine,"Horse Illustrated is one of my favorite magazines and I have subscribed to it for many years. They offer good info on English and Western riding, horse care, and many other topics. It seems to lean a bit more to the Western side though. I really enjoy reading their articles, and the magazine is really colorful and attractive to you eye. So why do I rate it four stars? Because their are many ads throughout the magazine that take up most of the page."
3,Horse Illustrated,"I started reading Horse Illustrated (HI) when I was a horse-crazy kid and I loved it. But now that I'm an adult and have gotten more serious with my riding, HI doesn't cut it anymore. It caters to both western and English riders and provides general horse care information. That means if you're looking for in-depth riding articles, you'll want to try discipline specific magazines like Practical Horseman, Dressage Today, or Horse & Rider instead.My biggest gripe with HI is that none of the articles stick with you. Nearly every topic the magazine covers can be found in any horse care book. Also, the magazine is rather thin with LOTS of ads and breeder listings in the back.The bottom line: If you love horses and just want a general horsey mag, you'll like HI. If you want to read something that goes more in-depth, you might want to look elsewhere."
3,"""fashion mag""","HI is the industry's fashion magazine. There isn't really any depth, you just look at it for the pictures. Sometimes there's nothing wrong with that though."
4,Horse Illistrated,I am glad this is not full of inappropriate ads so my daughter can enjoy it. This magazine is full of a lot of useful information.
5,Great service,I ordered Horse Illustrated in the beginning of April and have already received 3 issues by May 3. Other magazines take 3 months to send you the first issue. Very informative and great pictures.
4,Great for Riders and Admirers Alike,Bought this subscription for my daughter with gift certificate and she loves it. Great for all people involved with our horse friends
1,A junk magazine,"Illustrated indeed. Lots of advertisements, poor writing, terrible advice. Don't bother. Now wonder they're marking the price down."
4,"Fine, but not as good as their first","This is a reprise of the wonderfully successful first album these two did together. It is worth having not only for their obvious enjoyment working together, but for the terrific job in ""Let The Good Times Roll"".Otherwise, this is not as good as the first effort, which I thought had much more wide range of songs. Make that your first purchase of these two."
5,BB King at his best!,"I have been listening to this record for over 25 years, BB:s tone on this record still strikes me as it did the first time I heard it. One of BB:s outro:s in one of the medleys on this record is a fantastic value for the price paid for this alone. You can hear a young BB play really loud and strong making his amp sing in fantastic overtones on this one, not that nice and sweet studio tone. The two artists, BB and Bobby, works very well together and if their first record together was Bobbys, this is definitely BB:s."
2,NOT ABOUT LEO BUT AN ANNOYING BIMBO RUNNING AROUND,I have this on an english tape and This video didn't have any actual footage of leo but pictures that most massive Leo fans should have already.There was a SO called Leo look alike that didn't look anything like him. This video is mainly about stupid so called fans wanted to get on telly.It's worth buying if you really love leo like me.And it's a laugh at the bimbo's expense. This is aimed at the younger Leo fans.
2,"Good for info ABOUT Leo, not FROM Leo",A badly made fan film that gives facts and shows fans giving their opinions on various things. Basically Idalis runs around like a preteen trying to find Leo's house and goes crazy when she spots his car. You follow her and see a supposed Leo-look-alike. The lowest point of the video is the footage of his highschool when Idalis takes a piece of gum under Leo's old desk and puts it in her mouth.
1,Why don't they leave the classics alone!!!!,"I purchased this book for my two year old daughter for Christmas. I was shocked to see how much the tale had been changed. It is no longer a papa bear, mama bear, and baby bear - it is a big bear, medium bear, and baby bear. In the first picture, the big bear is carrying a purse and the medium bear has pliers in its hand. Later the big bear still has a purse and is smoking a pipe. The book later refers to the big bear as a him and the medium bear as a her, but the illustrations are enough to cause me to throw out the book. I want my child to know that a father can be manly ( not carrying a purse) and a mother can be feminine. Get rid of the gender neutrality!!!"
3,does the job!,Well I think I got a good phone for the price. The handsets are a little heavy and the coloring is quite dull. Overall nothing fancy about the phone. Works fine and four handsets for $39 was probably ok especially for people who do not care for looks!
2,Only 2 expansion sets and not 3 as mentioned in Amazon,The phone comes with only two extra handsets where as the images depict 3 extra handsets apart from the handset for the base unit. I called up amazon and they were ready to refund me 25% of the price because of a missing expansion handset.I needed a total of four handsets for my use. I am returning it back for a full refund.
4,"For managers, not the developers - and very practical","Like the other reviewer, I picked up the book hoping for WebMaster tips, but found that it is really not geared toward the technical aspects, but the larger organizational issues. This book is aimed at the business people who are making decisions about whether or not to have a Web Site, who to give the development work to, and how to avoid getting caught up in the hype associated with the ""net"". Although the book is 2 years old, the author was smart enough not to mention specific products or technologies in great detail. Instead of telling you which products to use, she describes how to sort through the facts (and the hype) for yourself. This book is about sound IT management - it won't be out of date next week. Oh... and it's also written with wit and style that makes it an enjoyable read."
2,Fairly superficial primer to web site design,"As a professional web developer, I hoped to pick up some tips in this book on the management of sophisticated web sites. I was disappointed. For my purposes, the book was dated (written over two years ago) and superficial. Although readable and well organized, a more accurate title for the book might be ""a 1996 guide to building web sites""."
3,"Looks cool, could be better","When I bought this the only description on amazon was ""large enough for the whole family"" which would lead one to believe it's larger than the 19"" high, 12"" diameter it is. Construction-wise it's about the quality of something you'd buy at ikea. The stainless steel sheet for the sides is pretty thin and would dent easily. There's a seam you'll want to face the wall. I find it humorous that one of the bullet points on the side of the box says it can double as a bathroom stool to sit on. I guess if you weigh 90 lbs. it might not crumple."
2,"Looks cool, but...","My girlfriend got one of these for me for a Christmas gift. She simply wrapped the package it arrived in (shipping box).When I opened it, the hamper was pretty much smashed from delivery. The box was highly damaged as well. None of this is really the manufacturer's fault or Amazon's (although I did return it for credit), but the construction is quite weak. Just a light hit will permanently dent this thing.In addition, while I didn't use it, the size was rather small. I would have had a hard time getting more than 2 days of clothes in it. That's really the opposite of what I would use the hamper for.I think I could make my own out of sheet metal that would look as cool and cost less--plus wouldn't dent as easily and hold plenty of clothes.I guess I would say: Keep looking."
5,Great Product,I have an InSinkErator garbage disposal that is still going strong but the rubber baffle had warn out and broken away. This removable sound baffle is an easy solution to replace the broken one without having to go through the trouble of removing the disposal to replace it. It snaps right in and fits perfectly and the cool thing is your can easily remove it to clean. I highly recommend this product!
4,"Prompt, and as advertised","Hard to get excited about a disposal rubber splash guard, but the company delivered well before the advertised date."
1,not correct item,this looks like the correct splash guard but it is not. I could not make it fit. I tried to return it to the shipper but could not. Some things just should not be ordered online.
5,InSinkErator Baffle,"My disposal rubber guard was looking terrible and hardly functioning after 14 years. Most of the rubber 'fins' had broken off and food came gushing up when I turned it on, never mind the loud noise. My plumber suggested this product after confirming that my disposal was in fact an InSinkErator mechanism, even though it has a different brand name on the rim. If yours is old but not leaking, etc, try this baffle rather than having a plumber take apart your disposal, risking opening a can of worms. It truly is a three minute fix, kills the noise, holds back the grinding food, and looks great. Just snip off the remaining rubber parts on your existing guard, clean the gook out from under the rim, and ease in the new one on top of the old rim. Everything should be this easy and inexpensive! It's also easy to pull out to clean periodically."
3,Clay pot cookery obtuse,"When I ordered this book, I had hoped to find some basic, practical recipies. Instead, many of the recipies are based on ingredients that might do for special occasions, but not for everyday family dining on a modest budget. For instance, the author seems only to like ""boneless, skinless"" chicken breasts; I find that these ""supremes"" do not hold up well cooked this way - too dry. It's almost as if she is attempting to devise recepies that cater to the health- concious fanatics and yet produce an entree with a bit of flavor left! I tried the one whole-chicken suggestion, but found the anise had lost most of it's flavor by the time the bird was done. What a pity. Perhaps I'll do my own book-""Basic Meals in a Clay Pot"""
3,"different, but stupid","This movie wasn't the funniest movie of all time but an okay one. I'm not saying don't watch the movie because it does have a different story line. Its just kind of like making a cake, and the icing looks good, but when you bite into it, it taste like dog doo doo. I wont give away too much of the story, but it's about to under cover cops. Dressing up as white women because they have to stop this man that kidnaps women or something like that. There are some funny parts that will make you kind of chuckle, and make other split their sides. I was going to really give this a two because the movie is very stupid. But some of the actors were good. SOME OF THE ACTORS.I'm glad I rent these movies before I buy it."
4,Unexpected Laughs,"This movie was very funny. The best one I saw in a while. The Wayans brothers were so funny acting like women. They had masks and fake boobs. The bathroom scene was the best, it had me rolling on the ground laughing. So many times they almost blew their cover. The younger brother ended up on a date with a famous black guy. The brother had to act so rude to get him away and nothing worked til he revealed who he was at the end of the movie. The other one went on a date with a reporter. They got fired for acting the the Wilson twins. At the end they caught the bad guys and got their jobs back."
1,RACISM!!,"How can these racist producers get away with making this vile filth? If two white guys tried dressing up like black women, not only would the film not get made but if it did, the NAACP would be protesting it. These left-wing racists need to be spit on and boycotted."
4,"Now, This is entertainment !!!","A very funny movie indeed that treats the audience to very funnystuff that will make you laugh again and again. This movie wasnot made to insult your intelligence with cheap jokes or toilethumor like most comedies these days.And for a Bonus,,, its good for multiple viewing.Top notch acting also....Great stuff...enjoy"
2,kinda good but failed to meet my expectations,this isn't scary movie. sadly it's not even close. i expected laugh out loud funny comedy but the entire first half was so incredibly dumb that it was sickening.
1,the worst,"Saw this movie at a free screening, didn't really want to because it looked lame. I should have stayed home and cleaned my toaster oven. I mean is Hollywood this desperate for material. They didn't look like any white chicks I've ever seen. They looked more like back up members for Marilyn Manson. We all know the cost (for 2) of seeing a movie, and with drinks and popcorn it's a pretty penny. Trust me stay home, rent a movie at your local vdeo store and bake some brownies. It's going to be a much better and more affordable night, because ""White Chicks"" ~is one of the lamest comedies to come around in a loooong time."
1,Garbage a waste of your time,This is pure racism and should be thrown in the dump where it belongs. It really takes a lot of effort to pick on teenage girls - bet they think they are tough.
1,Who comes up with this stuff?,"I really don't understand why anyone would make this film. The Wayans Brothers have made me laugh before with films like Scary Movie, but the writing, the acting, and the characters are really bad. The jokes are not funny. The worst part about this movie is that the characters are so dumb, that they don't understand that their white girl friends are really black guys. The unrated edition adds one scene that actually gives me the ability to give this one star. The movie is so rediculous and so farfetched and so over the top that it really is not funny at all. It's definitely a dark spot on Hollywood cinema. I hated it."
4,A movie worth watching!,"I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it is a very pleasant and entertaining movie.White Chicks brings to the screen the story of two FBI agents who go ""deep"" undercover in an effort to prevent two wealthy girls from being kidnapped. Along the way, they get into all sorts of trouble resulting in a great comedy!Though not a masterpiece, White Chicks is a very funny movie, guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs. The casting is very good, and the story is very well written.On the negative side, the unrated version is only in relation to language...Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!Strongly recommended for an evening's entertainment."
3,"5 stars for comedy, 3 overall however.....","the movie is hilarious, i will give it that....but the plot is just SO stupid and not believable at all. I mean, if you look past the plot problems and the believablity issues, the movie would be great. But i couldnt see past it. Although some of the scenes did have me laughing hysterically, it wasnt enough to make me enjoy the movie THAT much...Thats just my opinion"
5,Not to be taken that seriously...,"It was a light hearted silly movie, not to be taken as anything more than that. To heck with the harsh critics on here. Loosen up and enjoy the parody-- because really, that's all it is... There was nothing that I found to be particularly overdone or offensive in terms of underlying racial statements. It's just meant to be a silly movie to bring about a few laughs, so that's how it should be taken; if you don't like the Wayans brothers, racial parodies, or aren't familiar/ comfortable with the work they did in the early 90s series ""In Living Color"" then just stay out of the theater. It's as simple as that."
2,OK...But not that funny!,"I rented this movie expecting so see a laugh-out-loud comedy from the Wayans--this didn't do it for me! The Wayans brothers' FBI job seems a little bit unrealistic, and the voices they use to impersonate the Wilson sisters get pretty annoying by the end. They sound too gabby!There was one part where I laughed when Latrell started singing the Vanessa Carlton song in car...That was my only LOL...If you want to rent a funny movie, don't rent this one. It drains along with not much plot to go on, and tries to have a heartfelt message at the end. Not what I wanted to see."
5,Gotta love the Wayans brothers,I could watch this movie a million times over and every time I would laugh my butt off. The Wayans brother are funny as heck!
4,Not the best but ok.............,ok......for those of you who saw the movie but yet called it awful and racist...you guys have no sense. What did you think the movie was gunna be about black CHICKS.. I MEAN C'MON...why are you people getting offended. Do you act like that..if not..get over it..its a movie..and all ur controversy is making people want to see it more...so KEEP IT COMIN. the movie is not a racist movie. it shows black people in a negative way also. The people who say this movie is racist. I must wonderin if you yourselves are.
1,No Laughing Matter,"This is an awful movie, and not a laugh anywhere. Actually, it's quite disgusting. Not only is it racist towards whites, but it stereotypes blacks. All African Americans should be insulted, and the Wayans should be ashamed of themselves. I truly wish I could rate it zero stars."
5,Extremely hilarious,"I have watched this movie 4 times in Theatre, and would not mind seeing it the fifth time. This movie is lovably funny and nice. You can laugh till your hilt for the 1 hr 45 min. I do not care about what critics say, but this movie is a must see for people who love sense of humor and fun!!"
1,DVD Broken,"Our DVD arrived broken, I had posted a review before the gift had been opened since the DVD arrived in adequate time, but did not yet know the condition of the DVD."
2,Stupid But Watchable,"White Chicks is a stupid, mildly funny film that is actually watchable! The film may not be as funny as ""The Hot Chick"" but its still managable! Watching The Wayans brothers embarss themselves was quite amusing! Otherwise, its just a mildly funny film."
4,Not Oscar Material But a Good Laugh and Entertaining,This is a funny film and good if you are looking to be entertained and have lots of laughs! I am a blonde white chick and I was not offended at all!! Forget about the bogus accusations of racism! It is just for fun!!!!!
5,white chicks great movie,"First of all, anyone who thinks this movie is racist needs to seriously re-evaluate the purpose of making this movie. The point of this movie was to make people laugh. That's why it's called comedy. Sure, there were a few jokes that were aimed at stereotypes, but it was all a big joke. Nothing here should be taken seriously, let alone offensively.All in all, great movie. Many laughs. 5 stars"
4,This brothers make everything funny!,"I usually don't like american humor. But i really enjoy this movie, i think the wayans brothers are the best. It wasn't that stupid humor neither corny. It was intigent and very funny.it's a Must see!Plus, in the future selections, u can see how they did all the makeup, it was a very hard work!"
5,Love this movie!,"This movie is fantastic, though it is HIGHLY inappropriate for younger audiences. The unrated and uncut version includes fantastic scenes not shown in theaters that add to the overall comedy of the movie."
4,"Funny, stereotypes and all.","A very funny video, with all the typical stereotyping, from women and clothing fitting, lactose intolerance, to the parodies of the rich society girls (i.e. Hilton sisters) are hilarious. Some may find some of the crudity of flatulence rude, but it works in a cheap way, and in reality its part of human qualities,, and human existence. So laugh, because its funny."
5,So Funny,"This movie was so funny I could not stop cracking up, thats how good and funny it is , This movie is worth getting."
4,Hilarious!,My husband and I thought this movie was hilarious. We couldn't stop laughing! The Wayans brothers were great.
1,Are you serious?,"How is it possible this movie is averaging 3 1/2 stars? Jesus people did you actually watch the movie? I'd say it's the worst movie ever, but I've yet to see ""Little Man"". Man, that one has got to take the cake.But as for this movie: the plot is ridiculous, the racism atrocious, the acting makes Paul Walker look like an Oscar winner, and the premise just so lame it makes me want to castrate the writer. I can just hear him thinking: ""Hey I've got a great idea for a hilarious and original comedy! We'll have two MALE fbi agents go undercover as WOMEN! Hahaha! Histerical! Because really, they're men, but everyone will think they're women! Except the audience, and we'll all laugh at the pranks they pull on people! Oooh oooh wait wait wait... Even better idea! They'll be two BLACK men pretending to be WHITE women! Christ I'm a genius! Instant comedy gold! And completely original too! I smell a hit!""Blehhh. I smell excrement. Ditch this crap."
1,OMG!!!,My favorite comedt. Got the movie and was so excited to watch it. Opened it only to find the dvd was broke in half..... :-(
3,White Chicks,"I just watched this movie for the 2nd time today. It was pretty funny. So I give it 3 stars. Not extremely funny, but not horrible either. The Wayans act pretty good, having to act as girls and I think that they did a pretty good job of it. The storyline, you know just the typical one for this type of comedy. One of the funniest parts was when that black guy was dancing blowing the whistle, LMAO! That sh** made me seriously start bustin out. But if you want a decent comedy movie worth checkin out, then check this one. Its not bad. But it was kind of cheesy how they made the Wayan brothers look like girls, its like if you seen people like that really then you would know for a fact that they were fake and had costumes on lol. But decent movie."
4,Terry Crews stole the entire show,"The plot of this movie isnt good, the makeups are bad.....but the movie by itself is really funny...specially when Terry Crews appears...........the part when he sang a ""Thousand miles""....make me laugh so hard that my stomach hurts a lot after that......Very entertaining movie...is recommended if you want only a movie to make you laugh with a plot nothing seriously...."
4,Entertaining,"As I sat down to watch this movie, I wondered who would be the brunt of the jokes, blacks or whites. To my joy, it was neither.It seems this time the high class, dingy rich snobs are the ones put down and in quite a humorous way.The Wayans brothers play FBI agents, who despite trying so hard keep messing up. Finally, they see a chance to redeem themselves and foil a kidnapping of two rich sisters, due to take place at a weekend at the Hamptons. Taking the white rich sisters place,made-up to look like them, the fun begins.This movie had some good chuckles in it,and I found it entertaining.Shirley Johnson"
1,Racist,"I have to agree, this movie is racist and unfairly stereotypes white women.Don't buy this piece of $h!t."
1,Awful movie,"The movies sucks, as expected. The premise is racism.Lets balance it out and show a movie where white guys dress up as black girls, eat fried chicken and watermelon, speak street slang, and basically act loud and uncouth. It would be particularly funny to see the makeup and the pathetic ""black hairstyles"" with weaves, etc..Would be very funny indeed."
2,Hit and MISS comedy,"This film has sooo much potential and could have been much more funnier and it just annoys me that the Wayans bros did an utter and complete s**t job at this. It was stupid..painfully cliche,jokes are TASTELESS and just...crap.I think that if this film was placed under different cast/director, it woulda been much better. The Wayans brothers aint as funny as they used to be and I think they know it too..hence 'White Chicks'.I'd say the only part to just about smirk to, is the part when they start having a mother dissing match and the 'white' chicks are like 'oooh u wanna talk about moth-errrzz!!..', yeah that deserves a snort or 2..everything else in this film is just a waste of budget money."
4,Daughter LOVED it!!!,My daughter loves this movie and although we are able to get it on Netflix whenever she wants to watch it she just had to have it in her collection!!!!
3,Fairly funny,"The two main actors had to lose weight to fit into their new roles as white blond girls, and the effort shows. Except for their hands, their appearance was rather convincing. The storyline is also fairly entertaining, with some funny bits and dialogue. Not a movie I would want for my collection, but it was entertaining as a rental."
3,One of the Worst Movies Ever! But it was OK Anyway,"Anyone watching this movie has to be smart going into it and realize that they're going to be watching a baaaaaaaaaaad movie. If you know you'll be seeing a baaaaaaaaaaad movie you're going to enjoy this because it's so bad it will be held up as a comparison for other bad movies that come down the pike, so bad that it will achieve legendary status in the bad movie hall of fame, so bad that it's absolutely hysterical about how bad it is. From horrible acting to horrible story lines to horrible make-up to horrible stereotypes to horrible jokes to horrible sexual innuendo this movie has something for everybody to hate!It's really bad. Enjoy it!"
5,White Chicks,White Chicks was one of the funniest films I have seen. It is not to be taken seriously as it pokes fun at many controversial issues and really has no plot--it is just plain humor. I think it shows that talent the Wayan brothers have.The Wayans are cops who are always screwing things up and they finally get a job taking two rich girls to the Hamptons when they end up wrecking and the girls got scratches so they wouldn't go to the Hamptons -which would mean that the boys would have screwed up their job again. So they pose as the girls and cause all kinds of fun!I think I laughed through this whole movie I will say it starts off slow but it picks up when they becoming girls. I found this movie to be worth 5 stars because I personally found it hilarious!
3,scary movie was better,"It did have its comical parts, but it also had its slow parts with absolutely nothing in between. I love the waynes brothers, but this is not their best work. The movie was also stupid because the guys are taking the place of 2 girls and every one believes they look just like those girls and are fooled by their disguises when in fact they look nothing like the girls and you can tell they are men in drag, and black"
1,Racist movie,"""White Chicks"" is a completely lame and racist movie. If this movie had been named ""Black Chicks"" (with two white guys impersonating two black females), the African American community would have raised holy hell. Personally, I am tired of these double-standards. Save your money until ""Spiderman 2"" comes out...you will be glad that you did."
3,Surprisingly amusing,"White Chicks is actually kinda fun. While some jokes fall flat, others leave you laughing out loud at the boys' antics. The makeup is sooo funny as well as their mannerisms. The dance-off is hysterical and don't even get me going on the black athlete pursuing one of the chicks! Its worth a look when you have nothing better to do and will probably leave you with a smile."
5,The funniest movie in a long time!!!,This has got to be the funniest move I've seen in awhile. I've never sat through a movie and laughed the whole time. I can always depend on the Wayans brothers to do a good job. I look foward to seeing them play The Munsters!
2,Not the worst comedy ever,"I rented this last night at the request of the wife. She thought it was one of the funniest things she has ever seen but she really likes potty humor. I laughed about twice the entire movie.The movie wasn't terrible but what really turned me off was when they put on their white chick dress, makeup, and fake faces/body parts. It looked terrible. You might not be able to see it on a smaller TV but just looking at them almost made it unwatchable for me."
3,Actually Good,"White Chicks is actually a pretty funny movie. While it wont make you pee you pants, it will entertain you."
3,White Chicks,It is not one of my favorite movies but I still like to watch it once and a while. It is funny at some parts and hard to believe at others. I think it is worth seeing it at least one time!
3,A great light read,"Don't get too excited, it's ment to be sarcastic. For those of you who know much about how to not ruin your life, this book wittingly reminds you that you're lucky to know such things. And for the young person still in school or learning their way into the world, this book might just be more convincing to get your act together then a prechy self-help book. Just don't forget to look for other books that might be more helpful in a more serious way after you put this one down."
4,How to Ruin Your Life,"I liked this book until I realized that the subconcious doesn't understand a negative. While consciously I enjoyed Ben Stein's snarky but humorous tone, subconsciouly I just became a jerk. Well played, Mr. Stein."
4,Good reinforcement tool,"This book is quite funny and can be revisited whenever you need a reminder about what is important in life, I had a good chuckle over the P.Diddy comment."
1,liberal trash,"Ben has become nothing but a California liberal. He is an Obama supporter. For some reason Stein has become a BIG govt.,Big tax and big global warming freak.I stopped watching him on FOX and stopped buying any of his books."
2,Bad quality,"Usually, buying jewelry online is either a HIT or a MISS, i guess in my case this time, it's a miss. Theses pearls were all clearly blemished, and it's very creamy color (NOT LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWN, which look like perfect white pearls), the luster is true, medium as stated. However, there were a lot of pearls by the knot were chipped, those pearls looks kinda like it had been cover with cheap nail polish and now starting to peeling off. If you are looking for a pearl necklace to treasure or to show off, this is NOT it. Trust me, spend a couple more hundreds, you can find a much better pearl necklace that you can treasure and be proud of it later. My plastic pearls strand looks way better than this one (which cost me less than $5), and it looks better with my outfit too."
3,Sloppy not so bizarre,"This is the first book I have read by this author and I have heard great things about him. This book however was sloppy. There were so many typos it made it hard to read. There is even a typo on the back cover. The language was interesting, but just when you got into the flow of it there was another typo. Hopefully some of his other books are better and hopefully all the typos were not intentional. I ordered All the Mutant Trash and will read it and give this author another chance, because there was alot of potential in this book."
2,Ancient Text,"I should have paid more attention to the details of the book. It was published in 1980. Because of this, it does not reflect current materials or practices. There was absolutely no problem with the seller or shipment."
5,Plumb your own bathroom,"I borrowed this book from the library and wish I had my own copy. I literally built and, with the help of this book, plumbed my own bathroom with no prior experience. Everything works; nothing leaks. Logically organized, elegantly understated, Blackwell tells you exactly what you need to know about PVC pipes, fittings, and adhesives. Should be the prototype for all do-it-yourself books"
1,Poor Ernest,"I saw this at the American Film Market, while i was working/ slaving at it. HAHA. well, it is awful. I sat and watched it with the actors and the film maker. and poor Ernest Borgnine. Of course had to tell them i liked it. but it was god awful. Very fake looking and hokey. A very poor rip off of ET. Even Mac and Me is better. But they did give out stuffed turtles at the screening and i still have it."
1,"The second-worst film ever made, and it's good no one knows what it is","I cannot even mention this movie while keeping a straight face. It is so, so terribly and disgustingly pathetic that even kids will cry from the pure sadomaschist images seen on screen. The people didn't even try to make Mel believable; it's like the production desiger said, ""let's take some of this crap latex and stick it onto some metal parts. Take apart this Electo-set motor and form it into a turtle."" Seriously, did director Joey Travolta honestly think the mechanical turd was convincing? You can freakin' see the skin flopping around over the mechanics! And the visual effects are so, so poor that you'd think Uwe Boll would use them in his next mockfest. Ernest Borgnine was definitely on drugs to believe he could save this atrocity. Miss this, and if anyone tells you to see it, kill them."
4,"Thoroughly enjoyable book,with believable characters.",I really enjoyed this book. It made me want to go to Sri Lanka . I enjoyed learning about an exotic locale. What I especially enjoyed was the fact that the characters made realistic choices for the time and place that they lived in. I thought the two main charcters were very well drawn
2,Disappointing,"Enjoyed Funny Boy; was disappointed in this second effort. I couldn't help wondering if Shyam Selvadurai had someone from M&S breathing down his neck to come up with something, FAST. The writing is pedestrian, cliché, emotionally distanced from character and plot. Although writing rules are, and should (with discretion), be broken, Cinnamon Gardens suffers from a lack of adherance to the ""show, don't tell"" rule. I hope this novel won't harm Selvadurai's reputation too much. The talents demonstrated in Funny Boy will surely emerge again."
2,too long,"A novel set in the upper class of the gracious, repressive and complex world of the 1920's.Cinnamon Gardens is a suburb of Colombo and was built by the colonial masters for the purpose of gain. In these and around the gardens were exclusive homes; in two of these homes were related family members. This book tells of two families and their stories are intertwined. There is the uncle Balendram, who must suppress his secret desires and urges. And Annalukshmiis, a young teacher and niece of Balendram, whose family has arranged marriage to a man she does not love, causing her to be torn between family honor and her own independent nature.I found this to be a mature complex read of 400 pages. Fascinating read of the 1920's."
3,thoroughly enjoyable book,I read Cinnamon Gardens and enjoyed learning about life in Sri Lanka . I thought that the two main characters were engaging and believable. I especially like the fact that they both had to make realistic sacrifices.
4,The Buggles/Adventures in Modern Recording,"Although ""The Age of Plastic"" was a great album, Adventures is much better. The title track is very good, as is the rest of the album, but I think the best cut is ""I am a Camera"". Anyone else who likes this song may want to pick up the CD ""Drama"" by YES(ATLANTIC 16019-2) and listen to track 4, ""Into the Lens"" Same song,different spin. I highly recommend Adventures. Well worth the purchase price!!"
3,Buggles - 'Adventures In Modern Recording' (EMI) 3 1/2 stars,"Duo's second and final effort - gracing our ears for the first time in 1982. Think I might actually like this album a bit better than their first one 'The Age Of Plastic' (see my review). Tunes here I dug the most were Trevor Horn's ""Beatnik"", ""I Am A Camera"", the should-have-been a hit ""On TV"" and ""Rainobow Warrior"". I happen to catch Asia's all-four original member tour as support for Yes - here currently is what inspired me to check out these two synth-pop novelties. Some music junkies (including myself) have simply written the Buggles off as a lame-o musical project of years gone by. This isn't quite true - these two musicians actually had something to say. If you have the time, do listen for youself. Glad that I did."
5,1981 LP,"The 1981 LP is a five star album, so is this 2010 CD release. Included ten bonus tracks would make a whole new CD. Three of them are alternate versions of the first heard songs; another one is two part song. No unusual (but interesting) sax part (as in the bonus tracks in 'Age of Plastic' reissue) in any of them.Song credits and essay in booklet give the impression that 'Adventures' is a Trevor Horn solo album with Geoff Downes playing in several tracks. No lyrics in booklet can be considered a drawback.Artwork is fine. Tracks 1 - 12 sound good; Horn's British voice comes up well in demo tracks 13 - 19."
5,What a surprise,"Best music, gets better with each listen. This is a must have for those seeking new music. many hours of fun listening!"
4,Just like I remember it,Brought back some memories. There's some really good music on this album. It seems Geoff Downes had moved on to Asia and this was mostly Trevor Horn's baby.Favorites:Adventures In Modern RecordingI Am A CameraVermillion SandsOn TV
4,Superb pre 80s pop,"I recently acquired this cd and I am very happy I finally got it! it's AWESOME!! I love ""I am a camera"""
5,Oblivion,"This was an incredibly well-written book, but of course I mean 'well-written' in the David Foster Wallace sense. Many of these stories take a more serious turn, and prove that even without his expansive sense of humor, Mr. Wallace is a cut-deep writer. I like the fact that he seems to be kicking post-modernism/minimalism in the minimalistic pants. I find Mason, Ellis, Raymond Carver, and that crew pretty tiresome. In their world, nothing has meaning except meaninglessness (which is usually a meaningless pose). Mr. Wallace does take the self-conscious narrator route that John Barth used, but instead of ending up meaninglessly looking into a warped mirror, Mr. Wallace pulls his fiction out of self-reflexiveness by parodying that pose and pushing it out into ultimate meaning. Spiritual, emotional union among human beings is in my opinion the crux of his stories, even if that union is best portrayed by its absence that crushes people's souls."
2,Too Depressing,"A friend told me that David Foster Wallace was a great author whom I should read. Because I found this one in the library I thought it would be a good one to start with. Well, I have MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) and researched later to find out that this author killed himself because of his own mental ilness(ess). I struggled through this (mainly just to be able to say I did) but it caused me to use alot more of my anti-anxiety meds to do it! It seems that what many people call ""irony"" (from a review I read of the book) just seems to be more to be miserable about to me. Too dark and oppressive, I think. Not sure if I will try more of his work later. Maybe it will be lighter."
4,Smart enough for you?,"This collection of (not so) short works by DFW rates 4 stars based on its intelligence alone, but ultimately the works are less affecting than the pieces in ""Brief Interviews with Hideous Men."" Wallace seems too caught up in himself, his own theories and mind, to welcome the reader in. Yes, another mind is unknowable, as the difficult layered works here point out, over and over again. But if there is a gateway to understanding, it comes from compassion and empathy in combination with intellect. Whether it was the disease of depression or the diseases of academics that kept Wallace from attaching the sense of feeling present in his other short works (fiction and non-) to these is hard to say. In the end, the stories are a little less satisfying as a result and not for anyone looking for something more than hard work and hard thought."
4,"DFW Greatness, as usual","I haven't picked up a DFW book in a while, probably since ""Brief Interviews with Hideous Men."" I've always enjoyed his work, although I usually turn to pulp after reading it to cleanse the palate.This is a good collection of stories, written in his usual manner -- although fewer footnotes than previous works. The only gripe I have is that some stories seem to end just before they hit their stride. Many just stop. You feel that he's about to go somewhere, and then the story just ends, like he got sick of writing it and just said, ""aw, to hell with it."""
2,More of the same,"There are writers who engage almost solely a reader's intellect. There are also writers who engage almost solely a reader's possibility for emotional response (of course these latter often peddle to softness and sentimentality). Then there are writers capable of doing both, and doing it smart. I was hoping for a little of this bothness in this collection, hints of which I had seen in DFW's earlier stuff. But, alas, nada. These stories mostly sacrifice story for style and a systems-kind of cultual crit, which is great, if it can be woven into something where you give damn about what you're reading. I found these stories to be mostly tedious and a retread of previously covered ground by the author. If you're a fan, you'll probably love this, but if you are, like me, only one of the curious many, regardless of your personal tastes in writing, there just isn't much here to hold you in."
2,"Read this to study for the GRE, but not to be entertained","This is fiction of a style I would label A.D.D. prose: there is very little action yet we spend pages reading about dribbly insignificant details. It is easy to lose focus while reading this book. Wallace writes sublimely detailed sketches of the characters, but it is only a still life; there is no action, no dimension. The one redeeming quality is the English of this book; extremely erudite, it is like reading a dictionary."
3,Linnaeus biography for young readers,"This is a biography of Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, for ""older boys and girls."" I would estimate it at a middle school level. The book has 192 pages of text and no illustrations."
5,Samba Masterpiece,I'll probably never know how representative of samba this album is but I'll never care. This ranks up there with Bob Marley Legend and the Gypsy Kings Greatest Hits as one of those albums in which every track is an old friend that you are delighted to see again and relive the memories of days gone by.
1,no clue,"I love Brazilian music. This album may be by various artists, which is fine. How can I make a choice of this album if I don't know what songs are on it or even how many recordings I would be buying? If I have missed something please inform me so I can change my rating."
1,Didn't work for me!,"Purchased Natural Chemistry Stain & Odor Eliminator in hopes of removing stain and odor from brand new carpet in brand new house--Puppy accidents. I followed instructions on bottle, but it did NOT work. In fact, I now have larger, more obvious stains than I had before. I am trying to minimize the staining created by this product by using my old stand-by, Nature's Miracle. It is slowly lessening the stain, but I can still see it. I am completely dissatisfied, as you can imagine! Now I have a worse appearing carpet than before I used this product, and there is still odor. It failed on all counts!"
4,I love it.,"I get complements on it all the time! Unfortunately, though, the tip of the crown snags everything it comes across."
2,Turned my finger green,Obviously this is not a high quality product. I wore it for less than a day and it turned my finger green. I do not have any kind of allergy and I've never had this problem with my rings before. I am really disappointed because I like the way this ring looks and I love the design but now I have a ring I really can't wear. I will not be recommending this product to anyone.
3,nothing like the picture,"I REALLY LIKED THE PICTURE,THE HANDS WERE PRNOUNCED AND HEART STOOD OUT-SAID 1/2"" WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD SIZE,QUITE DISSAPOINTED WHEN i GOT IT,IT IS VERY SMALL,MORE LIKE FOR A 10YR. OLD,HANDS ARE BARELY NOTICEABLE AND RING SEEMS LACKING FROM WHAT I EXPECTED,SORRY."
5,A must for any scientist!,"This book tells the story about Polywater. It shows how scientists can follow trends and publish nonsense. I think it is a lesson that every scientist should learn - be more critical, be careful when you follow trends.The writing is very nice and entertaining. I really like the analogy with Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle book."
3,Good Album,"I had this on tape, played it alot. Sound of Silence is great. Helloween like with Forever Young, Crossing the Border, and The Fifth Season. Has Keyboards, I don't mind them on this album, but typically dislike keyboards. Memorable songs. High tone singer, light guitars. mellow metal I guess, Iron Maiden's Seventh Son. Youtube for samples. Progressive Metal."
5,Inspiring and an engrossing story,Engrossing and moving. Dr. Clements shares his personal observation of the war's impact on those willingly or reluctantly involved in the combat and those who are simply overtaken by it... all while he struggles to maintain neutrality. I found myself totally engaged and drawn along rapidly by the story. I am humbled by Dr. Clements' active demonstration of great courage and compassion.
4,Recommendation for the Publisher... (and Note for purchaser),"The book is exactly what the description says that is. The only thing I wish I had done, before rushing to purchase: Click to look at the paperback (or hard cover) edition and ""Look Inside"" at the Table of Contents. If I had done that I would have realized the book's focus is on U.K. & European Union Publishing Law. If I had read the editorial reviews, I probably would have been able to guess the focus would not be on U.S. law.I would recommend the publisher update the product description to reflect the body (or bodies) of law that the publication focuses on.I'm keeping the book, as the information will still be extremely useful to be able to reference & research."
5,Finally! About time,"I bought the entire set from Australia, not knowing they were not ""region free"" as stated. Been watching them on my PC. Fabulous! What can one say about Roger Moore that hasn't been said. Can't wait to finally watch them on my TV!!"
5,Foxfire 4,"Fiddle making, spring houses, horse trading, sassafras tea, berry buckets, gardening, and other affairs of plain living are the topics covered in this volume. Learn about them here in a great book. An excellent history of the Appalachian Mountain folks."
5,FoxFire 4,"This book is still revelent today for those of us who do not wish to forget the old ways. The articles on spring houses will be forever needed when we have no electric, gardening will keep us fed when there are no supermarkets, horses will still be here and get us around when we can not pump gass. Sassafras tea will be the new soda pop. This book will keep me and my family prepared for the unsure future."
5,Nice for the money,"I have 3 of the books I purchased off Amazon. I am very pleased with all. 5 stars Andrew Lloyd Do you have other editions used in the firefox? drop me a note through Amazon, and tell me. I only have 3 of the volumes.Many thanks Andrew Lloyd"
3,The Undead,"I love almost everything the Zombies recorded and like the rest, so the musical rating here is obviously a five, but this collection is far from necessary, hence the three stars. This may have an identical track listing to an album issued in Holland and Japan in 1966, but it really is a pointless addition to most Zombies enthusiasts' collections. It's basically an amalgamation of their UK debut, `Begin Here,' and their eponymous US debut with a few middle period singles tossed in. Anyone who already owns Begin Here or The Zombies would be better served to get the Decca Single double disc or, of course the end all in Zombies collections: `Zombie Heaven:' every track the band recorded in its all too short career is represented. If you're new to the Zombies this may be alright for you, though it neglects quite a few of the better early songs that appear on the US and UK releases. Then again, why not start out with the absolute masterpiece: `Odessey and Oracle?'"
3,Needs more Rothrock in it.,"Not a bad B-Movie thriller, but it clearly needed more actual suspense by the female killer (Lisa Comshaw). I would have liked to see more Cynthia Rothrock in this as well, but overall not a bad movie."
4,Inspiring...,"Excellent and quite uplifting documentary. We follow a small group of blind Tibetan teenagers on a journey to climb a mountain right next to Everest (23k feet in elevation... no easy journey); a daunting task for anyone, let alone someone who is blind. As we follow this journey it seems like the goal of reaching the summit is impossible, and this is why the movie works so well.I found myself rooting for these people so much it almost hurt. That being said this movie also presents an interesting perspective on how different people and cultures view life... the journey towards the peak in this case being a microcosm of life itself. Is the most important thing about the hike getting to the actual peak... or is the journey itself what is important? This one is just what the doctor ordered for a nice dose of inspiration... and to put things in perspective. I loved it. 4/5 stars."
5,"Moving story, great characters, interesting structure.","Author Fenton Johnson tells a moving story peopled with colorful, believable characters. Raphael, the gay son of Tom Hardin, returns home to his dying father. Each chapter is a complete and satisfying story. The stories are told from perspectives of various family members at different points in their lives. The chronology is not linear, engaging the reader's attention in interesting ways. Johnson convincingly presents the emotions of human relations, against the detailed backdrop of one southern family. He transports the reader into the world of a son striving to come to terms with his father before it is too late."
4,Still a Goodie!,"In its day, ""Midnight Lace"" was a stylish suspense shocker. As with any of its genre, once you know the twist, it never can have the same impact. But all the elements (the cast, the writing, the luxe London lifestyle that serves as the backdrop) are so first-rate, it still holds up remarkably well. I was disappointed that it would only play on my computer, but was warned of that possibility from the start. I'm surprised this little gem from the early '60s has not found more widespread release on DVD: it's a chestnut, for sure. The cast alone is worth watching: Doris Day (at her dramatic best), Rex Harrison (earning his nickname), Myrna Loy, John Gavin, and even Roddy McDowell in his best unctuous cad mode. Also Herbert Marshall in one of his last screen roles, and Hermione Baddeley doing her best Hermione Baddeley. It's all great fun. If you've never seen (or heard of) it, you're in for a treat. (I only gave it 4 stars as someone who already knew the surprise ending.)"
5,Midnight Lace,I love this movie but I could never find the DVD. I saw that it wasavailable at Amazon so I ordered the first one on the list of available suppliers. I was unaware of what region 2 was but when I put the DVD into my recorder it put on a message that said that it was not compatible with my dvd player. I was unable to rate the product but I gave it 5 stars because I like the film
1,Does not play in my dvd player,"I did not realize that certain dvds do not play in certain regions. Therefore, a Region 2 dvd will not play in a region 1 dvd player. tried to change format but it didn't work. live and learn."
1,Disappointed,"I was bitterly disappointed to find that this DVD is in a foreign language. I don't want to read subtitles, I don't want to hear Portugese in a strange voice. The ad says nothing about this DVD being in a foreign language. I have returned it to the supplier (not Amazon) for a refund. It is in unopened condition. We will see it I am given the consideration requested."
4,Midnight Lace,"This DVD is one of my wife's favorite movies and she had some difficulty locating one. Initially we were reluctant in purchasing it since it wasn't classified as ""Region 1"" but we took a chance anyway. Boy, are we glad we did!! The DVD is excellent and we have no major complaints. Neither the DVD Jacket or the menu are in English but that's no big deal. The DVD is in English and the Portuguese dialog box can be eliminated via the menu. I would recommend this item to any Doris Day fan."
4,A very interesting film.........,"I am not a huge Doris Day fan. I never really enjoyed her Rock Hudson films. However, there is something about this film that I truly enjoy. I love how sinister Rex Harrison is. Doris is absoluetly wonderful in the part of the harrased wife.The always fabulous Myrna Loy lends support as her Aunt.The film keeps your interest throughout.Hope it is released on DVD in this lifetime...lol"
3,A bit misleading,"This product does *not* contain the Nature's Miracle enzymes that break down specific pet odors like urine (to stop the behavior recurring). I didn't find this out till I found the ingredients list on another website.What you *can* do is use regular Nature's Miracle. From their own website:Can I use Natures Miracle in my washer?Yes, Natures Miracle can be used for laundry. For general cleaning and deodorizing, use two cups of Natures Miracle in place of laundry detergent in cold water only, on delicate setting. Do not use a dryer or hang outdoors in the sun to dry, as heat can weaken the enzymes in Natures Miracle and render them ineffective. If you have clothing with a strong urine odor, it is advisable to soak the garment in full strength Natures Miracle for 10-15 minutes, and then hang indoors to dry naturally. Natures Miracle can also be used as a pre-wash to freshen your regular laundry."
1,"Giving French poodles everywhere a bad name: Book not truthful, subject would make a horrible role model","The subject is a horrible mentor and the book is a farce, rosily presenting things to portray this person in the best possible light. In reality I would never want my daughter (or son) to be like this person - manipulative and dwelling in the past and on past successes, unable to learn or grow, and increasingly unable to function despite being a control freak. If you want to inspire your child, there are plenty of better ways to do it than dumping this book in his/her lap, unless you want your kid to be a narcissistic prom king/queen."
3,As An Am - Guitar Brillance,"Side A - Recorded May 5th 1982 in KolnSide B - Recorded Halloween 1981 in Palladium N.Y.C.Please note: I am a recent Zappa convert.This album, which features Ray White, Steve Vai, Chad Wackerman and Tommy Mars (formerly known as the 82 crew.) at their best. I believe that the album is a bootleg that Zappa bought and re-released in order to get back at the theives.Black Napkins and Young & Monde are both excellent instrumental selections with amazing guitar work over them. As a guitarist, I was truly impressed.Also includes a version of Sharlena and a Halloween installment of The Torture Never Stops.I am sure this is a must for the Zappa enthusaist."
3,Quality control please,"I've heard that Zappa bought this 'boot-leg' album and then re-released to so that he wouldn't be losing the royalties on the songs. If that is true, which it seems to be, I really don't understand how a man so obsessed with perfection could do this. If you are only listening to the instrumental parts/songs then the album seems okay but the vocals are terrible. If you really like Zappa and want a copy of the 'The Black Page', as I did, then go ahead and get this album otherwise I would advise you to stay away."
5,easy to read,"Short, bulleted chapters make for easy reference, but it is also interesting enough to just plough straight through. Definitely appreciate it as a brand new practitioner."
4,a must have!,"Although very different in style, i loved it! I think its one of those few indispesible books that ED resident should not miss in his library ...Just get it!"
5,"I'm not a doctor, but...","...I just like to read everything about medicine, because I hope to be a doctor one day. I found this book in the medical library at our university, and I liked it a lot. Compared to any textbook I have ever read, it is very clear and basic, but still covers a lot of information, and has a good balance between the weird trivial information that probably comes up occasionally, but is good to know about when it does, and the basic stuff. Also, some of the doctors who write chapters actually have a sense of humor, which makes the book interesting to read. Check out the chapter about bites and stings by Lee Shockley, which is particularly entertaining."
1,All five reasons except the simple obvious one,"If you've been to Tsukiji, as I have dozens of times over decades, you will find this book utterly pompous and almost absurd.Bestor will explain why many women who work in the market marry men who work in the market. He uses half a dozen tribal, kinship, religious and other anthropological explanations when a simple reason will explain it. Proximity.The rest of the book is arduous, academic and a waste of time. Tsukiji is a business, a wild and hectic business and nearly all behavior simply occurs for commercial reasons."
2,Bob,"I have been following Bob since his days with the Scab's at Steamboat in Austin. We went to every show and even some after shows during south by in the mid nineties. I have yet to see a performer put on the show that Bob did back then. When Lonelyland came out we stopped going to his shows because Steamboat closed and it was too long of a line to get into Antone's. Instead we would sit on the porch, drink beers till the sun came up and listed to Lonelyland. I even heard his stuff being played in Phoenix while on vacation, but unfortunately like all Austin musicians of that time, he fell into a void and his music lost something. In 2004 my roommate bought ""I'm good now"" and that was the end of being an avid fan. I believe Lonelyland is a must have for everyone and hopefully Bob finds his swagger again."
5,Fantastic From Beginning to End,I love everything Bob does but the gritty rock styles of The Californian make this far and away my favorite of his Cds to date.
4,Good Stuff,"If your a Bob fan, you'll like the album. It's mostly older stuff that he performs live but has never put on a CD. There are a couple of good new originals."
4,Rockin' goodness,"I purchased this CD based on the fact that Lonely Land and I'm Good Now are two of my all time favorite cds, I would easily give each 5 stars.I was initially disapointed with this cd because it was so different from the previous two, but it's one of those cd's that for me took several listens to before I finally got it.Bob rocks on this cd, and it's good, real good and it's well worth the $9.99 I plunked down for it.If you like Bob, buy this cd, if you don't like it the first or second time you listen to it, don't give up, if you're like me, it'll grow on you."
3,An album for Bob's live fans,"I like a live Bob Schneider show as much as the next gal, but for the most part I'm a studio recordings fan. Lonelyland is my favorite Bob album -- my husband and I even used ""The World Exploded Into Love"" as our wedding processional -- with I'm Good Now closing in as a close second. The Californian feels kinda unpolished to me for a studio effort, although I realize that was the intent. Definitely some good songs there, and a no-brainer buy for all Bob fans, but for those less familiar with his music I'd recommend the two wide-release albums mentioned above.On an unrelated note, I find the cover art seriously creepola, but that's neither here nor there."
3,Not that great,"This CD, while not bad, is nothing special. I got hooked on Bob Schneider after hearing Lonelyland- probably the best album I had heard all that year. It was truly outstanding- an easy 5-star rating. I kept on the bandwagon for I'm Good Now, which was decent (a 4-star rating). Now, the Californian takes another step down to a 3-star. Lots of throwaway songs, and only 1 or 2 songs that you'll be listening to over and over. It's just not at the level of Bob's best work. If you're a fan, you'll probably buy this regardless. If not- definitely stick with Lonelyland, and if you love it like I did, move on to I'm Good Now. This is Bob's weakest album, so skip it if you're not a big fan."
3,Not his best effort,"Maybe this review is colored by the fact that I saw Bob in an acoustic show before I bought this CD. I much preferred the acoustic versions to the studio recordings here. And, of course, 'Ralph' is best when it's an audience participation piece. But that applies to most of his less serious songs.'The Californian' is a good disc, but in my opinion, not one of Bob's best efforts. I much prefer 'I'm Good Now', and if someone new to his work were to ask me which of Bob's CD's to start out with, 'The Californian' would be third or fourth on the list."
3,Very slow shipping - but prompt customer service,"Although I was notified my shipment would be delayed for weeks, after contacting the company ~ they agreed to refund my money and cancel the order. So for good customer service and prompt refund, I rated them 3."
2,Not worth the pricw,"First, the screen on this ""computer"" is tiny (and I mean small!), dark and difficult to see. There are a few games to play, which my daughter found difficult to figure out at first. The games are not very fun and simplistic. She played with this off and on for few weeks and it sits unused now. Defintely NOT worth the price."
5,This book is worth it's weight in gold for coffee startup's,"I am currently opening a coffee shop and this book has been, by far, the best book for information. The book is a comprehensive book and covers just about every area. It would even be helpful for existing businesses. Not only is it a good book to read through from beginning to end, but also as a reference. I find myself constantly pulling it out again and again. The more I learn about this business, the more I have come to appreciate this book.I have gotten to know Bruce Milletto at his coffee school and found him to be very knowledgable in this field and he is extremely well respected by his peers. You will not be disappointed with this book even though it is pricey."
5,Like being at a banquet tasting other writer's ideas.,"I stole this book from my mother, who is also a writer, to carry on vacation, meaning to feel virtuous. Instead, I was captivated. The book truly is a collection of wonderful (it might be hubris to claim ""Best"") writing about writing--how it feels, how it works, how it doesn't, how it claims you and how you own it. I had to have my own copy, to keep rereading, and so I could underline. And, if you write, or want to, and ponder about the writing life, you should have a copy, too."
5,An enchanting mystery,"To begin, Deby is a friend of mine. That is no bad thing, because otherwise I might never have read The Magister's Mask.A murder-mystery in form, a fantasy in style, this book includes believable and likable characters and a colorful, vivid and consistent settings. It's a place that I enjoyed visiting, and I intend to visit again. (I don't know if Deby intends to write a sequel, but I sure hope so.)I hope you'll give this book a chance to enchant you as it did me."
1,I'm just not into it.,"I picked up this hardcover for only a buck and found the writing style to be a little stilted. To be fair though, I have never read anything else in the Forgtten Realm series, but this work hasn't even made me remortly curious."
5,Very cute! Strawberry and friends cooking up fun!,"This was a very cute movie both my neice (3 1/2yr) and I really enjoye this movie. It has some catchy little songs that you will find yourself singing throught the day...even if you don't want to. This video shares fun recipes that your daughter will want to make with you more than likely because it's Strawberry's and the insert has 2 printed out recipes. This movie isn't all about cooking. It has a story where Apple Dumplin has a dream that she is Strawberry's age and Strawberry and all of her friend become the babies and she has to ""take care"" of them. My neice really enjoyed that story and she was really excited that all of Strawberry's friends were back for this movie since they were no where to be found in the Berry Fairy Tales! Your little one will be pleased with this movie."
2,Not One Of His Best,"Shakespeare's Planet is about a geologist that just got thawed out from being frozen for one thousand years on a spaceship. The ship actually has a mind of its own. Literally, three! It is trying to find a planet that can hold human life. But of course, he is not alone, his trusty robot Nicodemus is there to help him when needed. This book, even though it is short, feels as if it's like 400 pages. Not only is it slow, but also a very confusing read."
4,Alone on a distant world.,Imagine landing on a strange deserted planet then encountering a series of other beings whom are as marooned as you. The title refers to one of the characters not the Bard himself. On the psychedelic edge of sci fi.
2,A weaker single than most,"Eh kind of single from a great bandMoving right along - ok song, very safe sounding songLife of the party - ordinary b side, the last 1.40 of the song is just an organ outtroAshes to ashes - acceptable cover of the bowie song, piano and acoustic version but lacks the uneveness of the original that made it so goodHanging on the telephone - a blondie cover this time, well lets face it anything is better than a blondie original.overall spend up cheap or spend whatever if your a completist"
4,Great piece of furniture for the money,"I purchased this bedroom vanity for my daughter's room. Shipping was fast and well packed. All solid wood pieces not any pressboard. Easy to assemble, only had to put on the legs and the mirror with a few bolts and screws.The only drawback that I have is that I thought it would have been a larger piece of furniture"
3,good one,"good price and nice quality, except the stool/bench legs break easily. but still a good one coz the table and mirror are worth it."
3,a bit disappointed,i think the sender could have rewrapped this item. it looks like it was a returned item so when i received it the protective coverings were all torn up.i also have a large scratch on the desk.other than that the vanity is ok.
5,Great Value!,"This set is beautiful! It does look best with a bedroom set that is of a smaller scale. But it is comfortable and sturdy enough for adults - you won't feel like it's a ""kids' set"" sitting in it. The mirror that is often offered with this (as well as my own furniture) is a bit more ""red"" - but it still looks great. Packaged wonderfully and so easy to put together!"
2,Oh fer pity sake.,"I ordered the vanity on Feb 19. It arrived in a timely manner. I had to laugh reading the other reviews because it did seem to take 1/2 hour just to get into the package. Once I got into the thing, I found it was missing a leg for the vanity entirely, and a couple of others we unusable on both the vanity and stool that came with it. They did replace the parts, but it took forever, and they sent damaged replacements. Finally resolved on Apr 11. It took 62 emails back and forth. I gave 1 point for what is a really cute piece of furniture and 1 point for a really good customer service rep. Otherwise, it was a complete nightmare. I'm pretty sure they shipped me somebody else's return. I was leery about ordering furniture online, and don't think I would do it again. This was an utterly exasperating experience. They refunded me a 10% discount, but you know...."
3,Fine quality. Simple assembly. Delivered damaged,"I choose this due to the size of my apartment. It fits great in my small apartment. My girlfriend is now happy that she has a place to get ready and thinks it is very nice. I am taking one star off because it is a bit plain. Still very nice, however. The main reason why I took off any stars and really the only reason I am writing a review at all is because this set was delivered (timely) with damage to the drawer. I didn't want to go through the hassle of filing a complaint, shipping back an oversized package and waiting for a new one to be delivered, which would be late for Valentine's day. I was able to simply fix it with wood glue and you can't see any damage luckily. But the damage upset me enough to at least write a review. I would still recommend this to a friend"
4,Queen Anne Vanity,I recieved the order in excellent condition and it was very easy to assemble. The unit appears to be very well constructed with the possibility of the mirror attachment which attachs with sheet rock screws. All the legs are heavy bolts and appear very sturdy. The finish is excellent.It is al little smaller thane expected but the price was right.
4,just what we expected,"My oldest wanted this for her 8th birthday - she spent a lot of time looking at all of the vanities and chose this one as soon as she saw it. The vanity/bench/mirror we received looked exactly like the photos and is very sturdy and beautiful. She is very excited and is able to use the drawer for hair ties, etc. with drawer organizers. It took about 1/2 hour to put together, but it felt like most of the time was taking things out of the box - it was packed very well. Very satisfied and glad to have a happy 8 year old!"
1,Table is kid size not for an adult,"Very bid disappointment for this item. I was researching different vanities for a month and finally decided to get this one, looked beautiful with perfect price. When I receive it I was shocked to know that this item is very very small, look like a vanity table for a kid. I tried to return this product but for some reason it not qualified to the return, so now I am stuck with it :( Disappointing because I was really looking forward to it."
2,"Nice, until you find the legs are uneven. Does not come with a sugar packet","Lot's of pressed board (which is the rule these days) and the drawer does not have guides, just sort of sits in the hole (Not the rule)... but still, I was fine with this the quality of this item and would have given it four stars until the final step of the assembly was completed. The legs are uneven. No it's not my floor, I tried moving it around and it wobbled the same direction no matter where I put it. I tried disassembling and reassembling, moving the legs around to different spots, etc. It made no difference, still wobbled the same exact way. Obviously the holes were drilled in the frame just slightly off. It would still have worked, if only they had included some sort of leveling feet, but there was no such animal in the box. I think that's a two star deduction. I'll try adding some felt tabs or leveling feet to the two short legs."
3,vanity,Missing some of the hardware in the box.. Wood finish was as posted and well done. Stool needed reinforcing also as this is for a small teenage girl
4,Nice for smaller women,"The wife likes it so that's all that matters to me. Easy to put together so I don't know what all the fuss was about. I guess some just aren't mechanically inclined. Anyway, it was a good buy."
3,Easy to assemble but the color of the wood and fabric is wrong!!,"I was able to put this vanity together in just over an hour. It was rather easy to assemble and the quality of the wood is good. There is one slight chip on the back of the vanity which doesn't really show and the entire piece was very well packed. However, this vanity is NOT CHERRY. It's darker than an cherry color. Also, the fabric shown in the picture DOES NOT match the fabric on the stool. The fabric showin in the picture actually matched my bedding perfectly but the fabric on the bench I received is something I would see at my grandmother's house. It's awful. I will have to reupholster it myself. It just wasn't worth shipping it back for this reason. Sigh."
5,"Nice looking, affordable vanity","While this wasn't my first choice for a vanity, I needed an inexpensive alternative for the interim. It is small, so if you are very tall it is probably not for you. Otherwise, this piece of furniture is beautiful - really beautiful; and it has a trifold mirror; which is one of the reasons I purchased it. It looked dainty in the picture, but it is SOLID...and so is the bench that comes with it. And it is VERY easy to assemble. It was also nice that the price included the table, mirror and bench. Most others I found had separate pricing for each. I highly recommend this set."
4,Nice but too small,The product was delivered in a timely manner and it was very appreciated.I like the desk and the chair that it comes with gives it a very elegant touch to it.One down side to it is tht it's not big enough for me to work with.Thank you.S.S
2,Much Better Introductions are Available,"Aside from an attractive dustjacket and artwork within, this book is not worth buying. I got rid of mine as fast as I bought it. If you're looking for a pictorial, gift-type book with an easily understandable overview of Christian mysticism, then I recommend Ursula King's Christian Mystics. For more indepth, non-pictorial, introductions to Christian mysticism, I highly recommend Bernard McGinn's ""The Foundations of Mysticism"" and Evelyn Underhill's ""Mysticism."" The latter is a classic text and the former (along with the other four volumes in The Presence of God series) is soon to be. - Brad Clark"
5,These guys are awesome,since i dont feel like typing a lot in order to convince everyone to buy this album...just go out and buy it! it will rock your socks off!
2,"Break out the cookie cutter, kids!","I bought this album without real high expectations, but even my low expectations weren't met. This album fights just to be decent. The first two songs get it going right, and the fifth song ""Phoenix With a Heartache"" is great, but *all* of the other songs sound the same. And I thought they were supposed to be a hard rock band. Well, if they are they need to get out and show it, cuz this cd sounds like another Christian rock band leaning way to hard on the praise and worship scene. The lead singer has a very unique voice, but I'm not exactly sure if I like it or not... and his screams sound a little to much like a squeeling pig at times. The guitar is lack luster.If you want to get some truly unique punk-rock-hard-rock-emo check out Blindside, Anberlin, Skillet, or Showbread. This will only disappoint you if you want to listen to some quality music. If you don't care about listening to something that sounds like everything else, go ahead."
1,Have you heard of Thrice?,"Have you ever heard of Thrice, Story Of The Year, The Used, Thursday, Taking Back Sunday and every other emo out there? If so, then Kids In The Way is nothing new. It's a good record it just sounds like everything else that is out there. I would go buy an original cd by Thursday."
1,Kids go home!,"Kids In The Way are nothing, but a Christian Cliche. Remember Whitecross, Barren Cross and all the other glam bands in the 80's. Kids In The Way are the 2000 version of Christian Glam Metal"
1,Just awful to manipulate children this way,"What possessed the publisher to put this into print? It is a massive guilt trip for kids. Distasteful and ... sacrilegious? ... maybe that's not the word I want.Totally irreverent, toward God as the Creator, and toward the Earth, and toward authority.Skip this book."
3,AMELIA....lost in direction,"Many ways to categorize this film. A potpourri of bits and pieces that invite the viewer to reminisce on the life of an avid aviatrix. Flashbacks, newsreels, and narrative with fantasy like travails into the wild blue yonder. It's not as much confusing as it is pointless. With a historically predestined finale we are left with the image of a determined feminist, glimpses of marital misconduct , and the affectations of a bygone society.Hilary Swank is in top form with a rather sedated Richard Gere. Supporting players are credible and worthy. Excellent cinematography. Editing, well you got to work with what you got and what the director wants to accomplish.There's a lot to want here and a quite a bit to wish for. But the end product is not rewarding.Best to see it and form you're own opinion."
3,Amelia,"Great performance by Hilary Swank. Very good story about the life and mystery of Amerlia Earheart. A tiny bit boring, at times, but overall, enjoyable."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","This is one of the most boring movies that I have ever seen. You could watch it with out the dialog and it would probably be better. Summary of the movie; girl dreams of flying, woman sits in the back of plane while flying across the Atlantic, woman becomes famous, woman gets married, woman cheats on husband, woman flies by herself."
2,Disapporintment,"I was looking forward to a magnificent epic but came away with the following:Negatives:Acting was forced, broken into short artificial segments and stiff. Dialogue was simplistic and seemed contrived. Story seemed incomplete, full of holes and failed to convince me of any in-depth understanding of Amelia.Positives:Nice touristy scenic aerial photography. Old film clips were the highlight of the movie."
2,"I love Amelia Earhart, but not this movie!","I was looking forward to sharing Amelia Earhart with my 9 year old spit fire of a daughter. I love the story of this pioneering woman! But this movie was a terrible disappointment. We had to keep explaining the plot to my daughter AND to each other. My husband and I were constantly asking each other ""what was THAT supposed to mean?"" The flow was so muddy and inconsistent that at one point we replayed to make sure the disk hadn't skipped forward. Amelia came off as a weary celebrity more than a gutsy barrier-leaper. There was a lot more ""making money so you can fly"" than actual flying, which may be how it really was in real time but not what a viewer wants to watch. The romantic relationships were time-consuming but not interesting. The story was BOOOORRRRING. Where was the sense of wonder that made her famous? A wasted opportunity."
2,Factual But Routine Biopic,"""Amelia"" is a biopic about the career of aviatrix Amelia Earhart (Hilary Swank), who broke many records in the early years of flying and was the first woman (and second person, after Charles Lindbergh) to fly solo across the Atlantic. Mira Nair has directed a routine biopic, when her subject calls for far more. Earhart was a feminist, a flier, a worldwide celebrity, an author, and a self-promoter, but the movie portrays her life in ho-hum, linear fashion. It relates the facts -- her championing of flying, and her relationships with publisher George Putnam (Richard Gere) and TWA founder Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) -- but never rises above a celluloid Wikipedia entry. Swank's portrayal is curious. She employs a Katharine Hepburn-like accent and speech pattern despite the fact that Earhart was from Kansas, not New England. Blu-ray and DVD extras include deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage."
4,Amelia - a review by Pandora,"Hi, all you movie lovers out there!I saw this great movie at New York City's Kipsa Bay Theatre and was enchanted by it! The movie was real, captured the look and feel of the 30's, and had plenty of romance and excitement in early flying to keep you interested and glued to the big screen. Hillary Swank's acting was fine and authentic as Amelia Earhardt and Richard Gere portrayed Amelia's supportive husband wonderfully. The photography and colors of the movie were terrific! The ending was very moving as Amelia realizes she will not survive her last flight as her plane, hopelessly lost, drifts over the great ocean, yet she struggles to stay brave and strong despite her emotions. What more would you want? This movie is a good flick and a must see!"
2,it has so much potential,"weak script, hollywoods obsession with sex makes this potentially great movie boring, mediocre. few flying scenes, historical hicups will keep you from getting to ivolved in the incredible life of this amazing women. save your money and watch this on hbo"
3,Worth it for the Planes alone,"You see planes in this film that you never knew existed but were major ""players"" in their day so in that it is worth an initial watch if you are into aviation history. The movie is a bit too deadpan imo. Not something I would watch again."
2,Enjoyable,"remember hearing about her as a young girl. Think I even read a book about her.Hilary Swank did a good job, always like Richard Geere."
5,Amelia,"Amelia Earhart was a woman before her time in many ways. This movie gives insite into her fierce independance and determiniation to achieve her goals. It is a snapshot into the past with antique aircraft, old cars, and powerful newspaper moguls. I enjoyed it very much."
1,Inconsistent and unfocused,"My wife and I watched most of this movie on Valentines weekend - we ran out of steam about 3/4 of the way through and I left it for her to watch without me. Although I have liked all of the lead actors in other movies, I found the characterizations and vocal accents inconsistent throughout this one. The director seemed undecided on which aspect of the story was the most interesting, so she constantly switched focus. This film was an extreme waste of some very talented people."
5,Amelia,"Like I wrote earlier, I love anything about aviators, especially the earliest one.Amelia Earhart was one of the first most successful flyers, and probably the first very successful woman in aviation. I wish I knew for sure what happened to her and her navigator.Would recommend to anyone interested in Amelia and aviation in general."
3,"Good movie, but slow.","The movie was good. Quite honestly I'm not sure how much accuracy it had with what historically truly occurred, but the movie was not too bad. The big problem in my opinion with the movie is that it have a VERY SLOW start. It takes about half of the movie to get through until you can finally begin to get into the story. I agree with some of the other reviewers that if alot of the ""filler"" would have been taken out, this would have been a much better movie."
1,Mindnumbingly uninteresting,"This was a boring, tedious, dull, uninteresting, dreary movie. The only positive thing I can say is Hilary Swank looked a lot like Amelia. Again, this movie was lackluster, tiresome and mind-numbing."
2,"Dull, Dull, Dull!","Amelias love story, little solid aviation, Poorly directed for todays audience.Dull, Dull, Dull!"
2,Boring Movie,"This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. How many scenes did they think we really wanted to see of those two gazing into each other's eyes. And, wasn't he wearing a wedding ring when he met her and a woman who was apparently his wife was seen in the background of one early shot. Then the ring disappeared with no mention of a wife and what he did with her. The movie was a very good example of exploitation on a grand scale of a woman with very little actual expertise or judgement and there just wasn't anything else to the story. Richard Gere's eyes have always been way too small and too close together but the glasses just made it look worse. This movie is a waste of everybody's time. The makers and the viewers."
1,I Pan Amelia,"Not a very good movie. The actors tried I guess. They were bearable.The movie itself was badly flawed.It did not move along smoothly. The old ""Spirit of St. Louis "" movie, of this type was far superior.It was biographical but it wasn't interesting. The costumes, color,lighting, was great.I couldn't help wondering how we won the air war in the Pacific with the technology shown in the movie."
2,amelia,"I picked this movie without question.because who doesnt love richard gere and hillary swank is an excellent actress as well and a first for the two to be paired up, but have to say i was very dissapointed. It definately proves that it takes more than an award winning cast to pull off a poorly written story. It started off very slow and did very little to keep your interest throughout the whole boring movie. Richard needs to stick with julia roberts, debra winger, etc. No love lost sparks with hillary......"
2,disappointed,"This plot should have focused more on the historical aspects of her accomplishments and some of the fluff should have been cut out. unremarkable performance by Swank, Gere & McGregor"
3,-----The Flying Scenes and Music were really Enjoyable---,"Overall this film was pretty good. Hilary Swank looked a great deal like Amelia Earhart and that was a plus. She played the part as a tomboy type of girl who in many ways was a free spirit. Richard Gere as her promoter and eventually her husband was also good, but I'm used to seeing him in roles where he plays a tougher and stronger personality and his character seemed a little weak for a successful promoter. I think the problems were with the way the story was written and directed. There is very little of Amelia's early life and not a lot of character building. I really just couldn't get into Amelia herself and understand what made her tick. I wanted to know more about her!Now, having said all that, if you enjoy seeing flight sequences, see the film, but don't expect to get a real biography of Amelia Earhart."
4,"Good, but short, interview with Hilary Swank","If you like this movie, or Hilary Swank, this is probably worth a look. There isn't much I can really say about, except that it is mostly an interview with Hilary about her portrayal of Amelia. Hilary shows her usual poise in the interview, and comments on Amelia's life, as one might expect."
2,Conventional Hollywood Biopic,"""Amelia"" (2009) takes the remarkable life of aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart and turns it into a disappointingly routine film. Hilary Swank and Richard Gere try to enliven the lackluster script, but not even director Mira Nair can sustain viewer interest. Stuart Dryburgh's impressive cinematography is wasted. A two-hour catalog of missed opportunities."
1,More modern dance than ballet. Excellent gymnastic dancing to truly ghastly music.,"This disc has been a no. 1 disappointment to me and opens with monotonous, unappealing music. The flexibility of the dancers is most impressive but hard to sit though because of the excruciatingly unappealing music. To me anyway, your take might be different.Later scenes are better but IMHO dollars are better spent elsewhere. It is obviously an impressive production so maybe it appeals to someone else who can give a more positive review.POSTSCRIPT: I thought the first bit was sped up but I've been assured this is not so. It has obvious appeal to some so I might try it again sometime. If I change my mind I'll let you all know."
3,Not what I expected.,I purchased this book on the strength of the reviews. If you are a Diana Palmer fan this book may disappoint. We have four different stories of people and their romances. I was not expecting as many sexual scenes and felt the story could have been simpified or expanded.
5,CD Tracks & I really enjoy this CD a lot...!!!,Here are the songs on this CD: Be Thou My Vision . We Will Glorify . A Mighty Fortress is Our God . Great is Thy Faithfulness . Fairest Lord Jesus . Amazing Grace . How Great Thou Art . Just As I Am . I'd Rather Have Jesus & The Lord's Prayer.....It always helps to have the Tracks Listed to decide to purchase a CD.
2,This book is basic and lacks any intermediate techniques.,"If you don't know how to kick and have never thrown before - this book is for you. If you are currently taking hapkido lessons, are beyond your first couple of belts and want to supplement your master's curriculum - I wouldn't reccomend this book. Mr Shaw makes some broad statements about the history of Hapkido which may not be supported by the entire Hapkido community. However, Mr Shaw provides a very knowledgeable account of Korean history and lots of clear photographs."
3,Nice decoration,I wrapped the garland around a candle and it looked quite nice....some of the leavesdid fall off when I handled it but all in all was just what I was looking for.
5,"A labour of love rich with photographs, stories and more.","'O&CB: Streetcars of Omaha and Council Bluffs' is a complete history of streetcar operations in Omaha, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, Iowa. Author Richard Orr takes great care in making the book detailed and interesting, with lots of anecdotes, photographs and maps adding to the experience. A must have for all fans of streetcars anywhere."
5,Small Fender Review,"Excellent purchase experience; just what I ordered, great value, and right on time!"
3,A great way to start out; broad but shallow,"This book aims directly at folks who have never used Access (or any other database software) before. For its targeted audience, this book is a fun read (even if the jokes are a little weak, it beats the monotonous tone of the books aimed at the veteran users). It gives a fine introduction to a complex topic and presents a broad view of many of Access' features. But it doesn't go into depth on any of them. The critical reviews I've seen here seem to come from people who thought this was a reference book. Far from it! This is strictly a tutorial. When the reader is through with this, they won't be intimidated by the book they'll purchase next if they need to do anything challenging with the software. Power users can skip this one. You newbies, jump in! (P.S. I teach MS Access to CPAs and use this for the class text. I have read a dozen books on the subject and could have chosen any of them.)"
2,simple databases for people who don't often use computers,"The beginning of the book was informative and helpful. It defines the way data should be characterized and input (but NOT in-depth). I would not recommend this book for anyone who is trying to utilize Access for more than creating phonebooks and other simple databases. I should have read more of the other reviews before spending my money. The author used to many jokes to try and make the book seem less dull. But what do you expect, it is a learning gude for Databases! I would rather have had the book boring and dull with information i could use, than jokes and information that does not help accomplish my goal. This book DID NOT effectively help in trying to create databases in a professional environment."
1,Too useless,"Compared to the other Dummies books, this one was virtually worthless. It is too thin in content and not worth purchasing. I bought it, but it couldn't tell me anything useful. Very thin on information and examples for me to get some work done. Upon recommendation, I immediately purchased Access 97 Bible by Gary Prague. Much more detailed, also easy to understand, more useful, good examples. Access 97 for Dummies is so UNDETAILED that it wasn't useful to work with. Too many jokes, not enough content. Definitely go with Access 97 Bible. Very good stuff, and my database right now is looking great."
1,"Not very good,poorly organized and inconsistent.","Windows Access 97 for dummies, if you paid money for it your the dummy. I recommend Microsoft press Access 97 and Access 97/VBA. They're much easier to follow."
2,"Really basic, weak for $","The other dummies books I have read have been much more informative than this one. I was brand spanking new to access and it helped a little, but as soon as I needed to really do things with any power to them, the book stopped short. It is a brief intro into a wide variety of topics, it barely scratches the surface, I admit I am disappointed. Maybe not a bad place to start if you can pick it up fropm a used book store, and definitely don't plan on it being the only book you use for access, no matter how basic your work with access is."
2,lacked progression and learning structure,"Disappointing book. I bought it and tried to follow it but it ""jumped around"" too much; the jokes or humor are unnecessary. It is frustrating at times when you trying to learn something new and concentrating and then you discover the passage you just read was a joke! I need some structure to learn and need to know why we are doing something not just ""this is what you do and that's it"". I'm currently looking for another book since this one was not helpful."
2,Extremely basic with too many unnecessary jokes,"This book disappointed me from the start. I bought this book the day I began working with Access. After reading the first 50 pages, I really had not learned anything very useful. It was returned."
1,Enough with the jokes!,"Too much of this book is taken up by distracting jokes and remarks. It seemed that just as I would get into some ""technical"" detail, a joke or snyde remark would throw the book back into the realm of uselessness. Further, I found the technical level to be very superficial - which is a sad commentary considering that I'm a beginner with Access!"
1,If Zero Stars Was An Option...,I was never so disappointed in a reference book as I was in this one. The author tried too hard to be funny and should have spent more time trying to be informative. I don't feel the basics were covered well at all.
1,Its a waste of time and money.,"I wasted my time going out and buying that book,than I wasted my money buying it and than again I wasted my time going through the silly jokes that the guy is trying to explain rather than access."
1,not impressed,"I purchased this bar sink for my RV. It looked great from the photo and description. The sink cost a fair amount, when it arrived it I was disappointed to say the least. (apparently Ackralac is greek for ""ridiculously overpriced, brittle black plastic""). I may have kept the thing but the drain hole was drilled off center as were both of the faucet holes. what a joke. sent it back immediately.on a positive note, amazon took care of business and refunded my card quickly."
1,"Poor alarm, sounds like a childrens' toy",Don't believe the description of this product. It does not have a loud 'alarm'. it is the same volume as the door chime and is difficult to hear through a door/window. I bought two of these thinking I could put them on a little used entrance way to provide some security against intruders- I think any intruders would laugh at the noise coming from this!
2,Not a good first line of defense.,"Can't really be concealed because it has to be in the open to detect motion. I tried to conceal it in a DVD cabinet between discs, but when the alarm goes off a light blinks and an intruder will be able to spot it easily and can turn it off in seconds. Not loud enough to be heard on a different floor and also goes through batteries quickly when left on."
1,Returned - Keeps going off,"I had to return the product the same day. After putting in a 9v battery, the Motion Detector Alarm/Chime kept going off. The Chime or Alarm setting didn't make a difference. The alarm kept going off by itself in an empty room... NO Motion. A waste of time."
1,Poor Product,"This alarm can absolutely malfunction and trigger a false alarm, and did for me. It was either broken when I bought it, or it is so sensitive that a bug walking by could've set it off. Needless to say, we were awakened in the middle of the night, terrified, thinking someone had broken in. No one had broken in and absolutely nothing had happened.This product is more of a hazard than a reliable defense mechanism. Spending more money on a system like SimpliSafe would be a safer bet for your personal protection!"
4,Hoping for more Sarah,"I totally agree with the previous reviewers. Most of it was great. Some of it needs to be cut. What makes it great is that it is different in that it isn't the usual someone is dead, find the killer kind of mystery and that I truly cared for all the characters. I stayed up most of the night finishing the book. I hope Jodi continues this series."
3,Too Much Detail Burdens Story,"I read this book before the 37th Hour and thought, ""Oh, no. I needed to read the first book to understand the story of why her husband, Shiloh, is in prison and 'Shorty's' story and subsequent murder.""Too much detail (about any and every thing) interferred with the basic plot line. And all those flashbacks to the night of Shorty's murder and why Sarah was protecting the real murderer made ME paranoid. I can understand Sarah' jitters.And, I don't think a cop in trouble with her own dept. and under suspicion of murder would further jeopardize her career by becoming intimately involved with a suspect that her Lt. wants her to investigate, do you?I gave the book 3 stars because this is the author's 2nd book. Compton had time and the learning experience to address: 1) too many details on plot, subplots, and characters 2) better cohesion of stories within the story. Cut 1/3 and you'd have a 4 star book because I really did like the protagonist, Sarah."
4,Interesting concepts,"I'm new to Deepak Chopra's theories and I have to admit that I'll probably have to watch this several times before I grasp everything Dr. Chopra was proposing. While some concepts I was able to get instantly, others I felt like we were bouncing around at hyperspeed and I couldn't see what some ancient cultures had to do with another, but before I could process that we were off to some scientific anaology. Through it all though, I wasn't bored. Overall, viewers need to come with an open mind to watch this."
2,Dog is God spelled backward,"Though doubtless well intentioned, this manages to reduce the ideas of one of the sharpest and clearest conceptual thinkers of our time to muddled fluff. Read the book instead."
5,always good,"There is such clarity in this. Just get it. If you like it try the book called ""Thoughts are things"" by Prentiss Mulford. You will love it - and Mulford died in 1891. There is no such thing as ""New Age"". The truth has always been here."
2,"Might be a good video for the layman, but not for the science or meditation literate","In this video, Deepak Chopra describes general concepts from around the globe about God and Gods and mixes it with basic science. If you know basic science of atoms and space and are looking for a deeper understanding of how to find God or the meaning of life you should continue with other videos' of Chopra's. After viewing other videos' of Chopra's like ""Deepak Chopra: The Essential DVD Collection"" I found this video very shallow, but I am a scientist so have a very good grasp of Quantum Physics, so my view may me skewed. I learned much more from his other videos'. You will also learn more from his videos' if you have tried some meditation and read some on eastern religions like Buddhism. He obviously has a foundation in this but does not, which another writer complains of, describe these techniques for learning how to understand how to get to the places he talks about."
2,Just okay,"First of all I've been into the study of hindu metaphysics for at least 10 years now so my viewpoint may be quite different from the general population's that watches this. I did't gain any new information in watching this and my focus was mainly on its production value and how uplifting it was (as claimed on the dvd jacket)Unfortunately I didn't feel excited watching this or uplifted. The dvd just felt very monotone throughout and I realize it wasn't done on a large budget, but the graphic effects were mostly below par.This dvd may be more ideal for introducing someone into eastern spirituality. If you want something uplifting I'd recommend 'The Secret'"
3,Some good advice given but this is not a recipe book!,"Clear, easy to read and useful. Most of the advice is common sense. This is not a recipe book, so be warned."
5,There's Much More Best of Joe But This is a Good Start,"I'm posting this in part to balance the review by one-star guy. His review reminds me of an old friend of mine who once panned a movie because the theater was too cold. These are all great tunes and a good introduction to Ely. There's plenty more where they came from. The one truly inexcusable (and inexplicable) omission is the version of ""Boxcars"" from ""Live Shots."" I would also have included ""West Texas Waltz,"" ""If You Were a Bluebird,"" ""Wishin' for You,"" ""Are You Listening, Lucky"" and ""Gambler's Bride"" just off the top of my head, and surely this CD would have had room for them."
4,i think the cd kix major...um... BUTT!,"i happened 2 love the cd... like any other true punk... the whole cd wuz great! when my friend let me listen 2 it my first reaction was! ok... WHERE DID U GET THIS CD! i was nuts about it..,. i dont care what the other people think in the other annoying and critical reveiws... tisss... i mean, what do they know! you like the kind of music u like so stick w/ it and be true 2 yurself... it doesnt matter what other people think of the damn music... as i always say... GO 4 IT!"
5,Awesome CD,"That's all there is to it. This is a rad CD. They don't get much better than this. This is the best compilation you will ever find. I dare someone to come up with a better one. It's not too possible. Buy this. It's a must. I wish I could watch the show, but we don't get it over here in california. This is a cheap CD with awesome as hell songs. I request AAA, Anti-Flag, Atom, AC, Bruisers, Anti-Heroes, In My Eyes, and well, just about every band on this CD."
2,So not what I was hoping for,This product does fully scan your items but it is not at all easy to organize them once they are scanned. I wanted something like this so that i could scan my bills when they come in and keep track of them electronically but it was so hard to use and access the docs that i gave up and am still working it old school.
5,A must for the CMA exam.,"Book is very well organized and makes studying by topic easy to follow and to understand. The book is organized by 10-exam topic followed by related questions, very similar to those on the actual CMA exam; some of the questions are taken from CIA exam.I think it is one of the few books that offer comprehensive material I found in the market on CMA exam. It is a must if you are serious on passing the exam. The Gleim CMA software is a highly recommended tool. Good Luck."
3,The Horns of the Moon,"It is not that the book is all that bad, it just was not the book I thought I was looking for.I receive the book very promptly.Thank you."
2,Dull and uninspiring,"There are so many fine books on the market on writing, that I am surprised that this book continues to be in print. Though it has some general good writing advice, I found it to be of extremely limited use. Ironically, this book which professes to teach 'the art and craft of novel writing' is itself written in a dull and lifeless manner. I was particularly struck by the author's list of ""must-read"" novels. Had I read his very macho, white bread reading list first, I would have realized his ideas about writing were quite different from mine, and saved my money."
5,LOVE this record,"These raves are all right on the mark - this is transcendent. Funny thing is, it kind of took me awhile to get it. I liked, but never loved, my lp, but a year or two after getting the cd it all clicked into place. I think sometimes exceptionally profound music takes a while to sink in. I'm sure glad I stuck with this, and trusted all the folks who said it was a classic. It's now a treasured favorite."
2,Two Steps From The Blues,"If you liked this, you'll love Texas Johnny Brown's Nothin' but The Truth, he's the man that wrote Two Steps From The Blues. He is awesome."
5,A great CD mirrors the soul of this great singer,"Though his singles never did particularly well on the pop charts, with just one Top 20 hit to his credit, Bobby Bland is without question one of the all-time great blues/R&B artists. Bobby's earthy, gritty and bluesy vocals lacked the smooth, cotton-candy type of singing that would have had crossover appeal but his voice was always true and expressive of the troubles and sorrows of everyday folk. Each track captures Bland's raw soul, especially ""Cry, Cry, Cry"", ""Don't Cry No More"", ""I've Got to Forget You"" (perhaps the best cut on the CD), and ""St. James Infirmary"". This early 1960s album is the definition of what soul really is, long before the advent of Motown, Stax and the Philly sound became the music of choice of black America. A true pioneer, Bobby Bland offers the best of pure, unvarnished blues that the bands on this disc offer."
3,"Great, but not up to date","This book was great for me, but a little disappointing, as it was pretty out of date. The copyright was 2002 and a lot of the careers listed don't even exist anymore. Furthermore, I paid more than the book was worth because it was out of print, as well, and hard to find. My copy came out a public library! Overall, it was good to get some general idea of new career directions for a teacher, but it was just good as a directional beacon. To really dig deeper would require more research, via the internet."
4,More good than bad,"Having read four logic books before, some of which I've read a couple of times, made reading this book easier than if I had approached the book without prior learning. I think that beginners will struggle with this book and would have to reread many of the later portions over and over until concepts sink in, which is not a bad way of learning either.I don't think that many of the rules of inference have been explicitly laid out.Another thing I didn't like is that there are no answers for the exercises at the end of each chapter.One thing I liked was the use of math to demonstrate logical arguments. It's also easy to read.In any event, the book still has value and is worth getting."
1,5 hours of my life that I'm not getting back,"I've recently started another book by edited Etchison and the name was hauntingly familiar-- all I could remember was that he wrote a lame book that was my misfortune to read many years ago. And this was it. Move on, move on, move on."
5,A great voice carrying great songs!!,"The first time I ever heard or saw anything of Sarah Slean was as support for Ron Sexsmith in Frankfurt/Germany. There she played a couple of solo numbers from her new album. What can I say: I was mesmerized!! A great voice carrying great songs.So right after the concert I bought the CD (not yet available in your local record store). Though the sound on the CD is somewhat different, as she's not solo, I was positively surprised: the rest of the album is as good as the stuff I heard her playing live. And if there was a live solo CD available, I would most definitely buy that as well.A great CD - so go on and buy it today!!!!"
4,Pretty Good,"This is a good CD. I love about half the songs, but the other half are just okay. 'Lucky Me' is a great song and makes the purchase totally worth it though."
3,far from excellent,This book has a lot of interesting information but its written in such a dry manner that it will bore you silly.
1,an expensive version of the pee sticks....,"please dont waste your money. this does nothing more than read the sticks you pee on and chart them on a 'graph', which has three levels, low, medium and high. it is extremely complicated and if you miss the 'window' set up by the monitor for testing every morning (because you forget, or you wake up late, or in my case, you worked through the night!) you mess up the whole month. stick to the ovulation predictor sticks, i feel sick that i wasted money on this. as for some of these reviewers who say it 'worked first time', that's confusing. a monitor doesn't get you pregnant, your partner does. i also believe there are some reviewers here who work for the company. please, please, dont buy this extortionate 'toy'."
1,No one takes responsibility for the product that does not work,"The first cycle I used it was in August and it worked fine until 2 weeks later. After that day it marked a telephone, a square and a exclamation (!) sign (that means it does not work any more) . I left some messages at the 1800 but I did not get any answer. I have been looking in Clearblue web page and I have not been able to find an email address where I can write looking for a solution. I wrote to BioMed USA Co. (the seller) Last week and did not get an answer. I am concerned nobody takes responsibility for this product."
3,Works well,It solved my purpose so I like it a lot. The only problem is as per the product specification it cannot be reused or pass it on to the friend and family. Which I don't understand because after all it's an electronic product. It looks like to me a marketing strategy so more people buy their product.
2,Inaccurate during the first month!,"The first month that I used this, I followed the directions exactly. It gave me a low fertility level until day 22, when I got two days of high fertility, and then it dropped back down to low and never got to peak. According to the instructions, this means that I did not ovulate, so I assumed that I could not get pregnant that month. BUT, my period never showed up and it turned out that I did get pregnant that month, and I am now 6 weeks along. Most of the reviews seem to say that people got pregnant using this the second month, so maybe it just takes a month to figure out your personal hormone levels. Beware that it is inaccurate the first month!"
4,Easy to Use / Accurate.,"I have been trying to conceive for about 6 months now & was following the traditional tracking BBT & CM methods. However, I wasn't that lucky. I bought this product last month & gave it a try & I conceived the same month (unofrtunately it ended in an early miscarriage 3 weeks but that's a different story).The product did what it is meant to do. It tells you your fertile period with 100% accuracy. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who plans to be on the family way.I personally had a little trouble in understanding when to tell the monitor when you start your new cycle. Ideally, the 1st day of your periods is when your periods start however per the booklet, if your periods start during day time you tell the monitor the next day. Didn't make sense to me or maybe I didn't understand it properly hence the 4 stars else it is well worth 5 stars.Eitherways, I'd highly recommend this product."
4,getting use to,Give yourself some time as this takes some getting use to. Read the instruction manual thoroughly at the beginning.
3,Works...when it works,"I've had mine for 5 months now and 2 of the 5 months it's timing was off because it didn't ask me to insert the stick on the 6th day. I'm well within the 3 hour window for testing. So now, I need to go spend more $$$ just to be sure of the right day...It's a good product if you are irregular or don't know when your peak fertility period is. It's not necessarily ""easy"" to predict yourself. However I don't think it's very reliable. I wouldn't spend the $$ on this again and would try the digital sticks. Those seemed to work well."
5,Got my BFP!!!,I got my BFP today!!! I'm telling you this monitor does not GET you pregnant but man does it take the guessing game out of when to try. I have a 31 day cycle and O on day 17 yea not all at text book like that why this monitor is great!! If you have trouble conceiving i would buy this monitor it might take a while to get pregnant because of maybe medical problems you have but at least you know your Baby Dancing on the right days...LoL. For me a healthy 25 year old It took only the 2nd try. Now I'm 4 weeks along and just told my Husband this am =D
5,Great product-lousy service,Clear Blue Easy fertility moniter is easy to use and shows promise. It confirms what I already know about my cycle. I am not pregnant yet but hope to be soon.The only thing I have to mention is I originally bought this through Amazon and I was HIGHLY disappointed when it arrived all the fertility sticks were outdated but 6 months. I had to send everything back. [...]
5,Fine writing on a fascinating topic,I found the story intriguing and the author was able to capture my attention and curiosity through a strong narrative voice. Her ability to utilize symbolic details to colorfully illustrate the situations added depth to the story. This is an excellent introductory book for those with curiosity regarding love ones who have past on. Highly recommended.
5,Wonderful new voice in film music,"Hopefully we'll hear a lot in the future of Alexandre Desplat, because he's a very nice new colour in the realm of film music. His score for the Queen is majestic, sophisticated and haunting, beautiful, moving and elevating. It deserves all appreciation and is well worth listening to on and on again. Bravo maestro, I highly recommend it to all."
4,Desplat call to Piovani,"If you like Nicola Piovani music composed for the great screen, this is a CD for you.....otherwise you will find the London Symphony Orchestra at the top. I have not seen the movie yet, but I am sure the score match fine in the british world."
4,The Queen,"I would have chosen a different actor for Prince Charles--in person he is not handsome! If the story is true to life, shame on the whole family. The Queen Mother always seemed to be a sweet old lady. In this film she definitely not sweet. I have been anxious to see this movie and was not disappointed. But still, I would like to know how true the story was."
1,Unbelievably Boring,"This film should have been a made for TV movie. Normally, I love British drama, but this was shockingly dull. All we see are endless telephone conversations between various politicians; everyone is in a tizzy because Diana has died and Queen hasn't reacted appropriately. That is the entire plot of this film. It was like watching an episode of the West Wing except everyone has an English accent.Helen Mirren, in my opinion, did not deserve an academy award for this performance; she spends most of it looking stunned. I couldn't even finish watching this movie as I kept falling asleep."
4,I-Dogs,I got mine for Christmas and I absotuley love it. Parents I might just be a kid but I really love it. So get it now!!!!!!!
1,not a new one,"I buy the i-dog for my kid, I order a new one, but I got a used i-dog. the customer service change one for me, but it is still the same old one. I have to go back to other country, so I have no time to call the customer service. not a good experience."
4,Tucker loves his teething keys,"Although he is now six, Tucker has had a set of these teething keys since he was a puppy. (Well, he's on his fifth set now.) He doesn't chew as much now as he did then, but in times of stress, these are a comfort to him."
4,Key Chew Ring,"This Nylabone teething key ring has lasted quite well. Although it is not my dog's favorite toy, she has played with it some and not destroyed them yet."
4,So Far a Good Chew Toy For My Puppy,"These key rings are pretty good chew toys for puppies. I have been trying to find a chew toy she will actually chew to divert her from the things she is not supposed to chew. This chew toy keeps her attention for a bit, which is unusual for my dog, and she seems to enjoy them."
1,dangerous - parts of toy easily chewed off - no stars,"One chomp by my puppy removed a sliver of this toy. MAYBE chunks are ok, but a sliver is never a good thing. It's a hard toy, so the slivers are no slackers. The size of the keys themselves were not too large (min. poodle puppy - 3 mos.).Get a ""puppy-sized"" Kong. Indestructible.Skip these, no matter how cute they are! mb"
4,A favorite of the canines...,"My dogs love these keys - in all sizes - but I stopped purchasing them because, after awhile, they start eating the plastic. However, my new Welsh Corgi puppy (3 1/2 mo.) was teething and needed some toys to chew on badly, so I bought another set. He loves them, and they're holding up well - the trick is to keep them away from dogs with heftier teeth! These, along with two other nylabone toys, are immensely helpful - he'll play calmly in his kennel or in the middle of the room for nice lengths of time without becoming bored. Definitely recommended - just keep an eye on them and replace when they become too worn."
3,Not for aggressive chewers,"I have to agree with Cnat's review: these keys are too soft. It's surprising and disappointing given Nylabone's stellar reputation, but I guarantee these keys won't survive long if your dog is a large breed and an aggressive chewer.Don't get me wrong, my Lab puppy LOVED these and they lasted for a while when we first got him at 8 weeks old. But by the 10 week mark he was chewing chunks off the keys and I was worried that he'd choke on a piece or have a piece get lodged in his gut somewhere. You're really rolling the dice with your dog's health if you give him a toy that he can chew chunks out of.It'd be great if Nylabone continued to make this toy for more gentle chewers but added a version made of a harder plastic for strong chewers like my Lab."
3,soft,"My puppy loves these keys. Unfortunately, they are so soft that she destroyed them very quickly and I find the remnants as I am cleaning up her waste in the yard."
3,"Good Teething Toy, But Becomes Hazard Afterwards","This was a very good teething toy. My dog loved it. However, some time after he stopped teething, he was able to snap one of the keys in half (he was playing with the large size) and almost swallowed it."
3,Not his favorite,"My puppy didn't seem to really enjoy this compared to his other available chew options. It might be because it's a bit too large for him at his age, 14 weeks."
4,Great cotillion gloves,"These gloves are a beautiful satin and looked great at my daughter's first cotillion class. She is a very skinny 9-year old and the gloves fit her well. They are advertised as fitting 8-14 years old, but I don't think they would fit a girl older than 11, unless she was very small."
5,washable and much loved,"My granddaughter adored getting these white gloves, and wears them to church, sometimes just for playing dress-up. They seem to wash very well and come out clean, also no wrinkles."
2,RUNS VERY SMALL,My normally sized 5 year old can barely squeeze her hands into these gloves. Word of advice by the bigger size.
3,"Good Story, Important Batman Developments","I enjoyed Cry For Blood. Its a nice little tale, even though Rucka is usually capable of much better. The simple artwork suited the Godfather-like theme of the story which revealse a little more about the Huntress's crime family background. It makes you care a little more for Huntress and makes you undertsand her motivations better.The Question makes an appearance but his motivation for helping Huntress seems a little vague. Still, the two characters work together very well.If you are a Batman or Huntress fan, this collection is good to have because it includes developments which have changed the relationship between Huntress and Batman, which were previously improving. It also reveals some of the flaws in Batman's ideology, from the point of view of another person, Huntress."
4,Who is Huntress,"Despite the co-billing, this is predominately a Huntress story. While there is a mystery element to it, it is more of a character study than a detective yarn; who she is and how she came to be. We learn of her family history and early tragedy, on through to adulthood and her transformation into the Huntress. We get a glimpse of her frustrations with Batman and he with her. His part in this play is purposely reduced in order to let Huntress take center stage, and while this decision is understandable, it unfortunately becomes the major weakness of the story. Why reduce the roles of Batman and Nightwing, who also has a history with her, to only replace them with the bland and boring character the Question. The story drags at times because of this and doesn't fully recover. Overall an entertaining and in depth read about the demons and passions that have driven this woman to become the person she is today."
4,"Excellent book, but 3 in one binding","I have already read the first Book of the series of 3 and I wanted to get the other 2. I found it very uplifting, and it raises some very important questions about the meaning of life, and your own life. Even if you don't agree with everthing in the books, it challenges you to discover your own beliefs. I would recommend this book if you are willing to be open minded and change a bit, while discovering yourself. The only downside is this book is literally 3 in 1, and heavy to carry if you're reading it on a train or a bus. Unless you're planning on reading it at home, i would recommend buying the 3 books separately. This way, you can share a book with a friend as you finish reading each one."
5,The Complete Conversations with God,"This book explains many of the questions that I have had, with answers that I can relate to. It is valuable reading for those who are still searching. It brings God back into our hearts and releases us from the fear and need to suffer, that has for so long been associated with many mainstream religions. It explains who we are and why we are here and points out that we are not sinners, as we have been taught. I did first watch the DVD, which was a powerful experience in itself. Having an understanding of how the book came about made it easier to accept."
2,Not what I was Hoping For,I'm only half way through the first book and already I'm tired of it. The different colors for him talking vs. God makes it hard to read. It also seems God is saying what the author would hope he would say. Very little so far has given me something to ponder on.
3,About this edition specifically...,"I will assume that if you're looking at this book you're already familiar with the series. So I'd like to make a comment about this actual edition. I feel the images here on Amazon are misleading. The book comes in a box. The box has a nice picture on it, (shown above), but the book is very bare bones. It has no picture on the cover, no dust jacket, and the quality of the paper is... debatable.I'm not saying it's going to fall apart, but I think it was a very low-cost or cost-cutting venture and it's not that high quality. Had I seen this in an actual store I don't think I would have purchased it. That said, I am very glad to have the full index and that is a boon. Even still, I am not that impressed, and miss the nice art from the original books (on the covers)."
1,Conversations with God,"This book is 100% rubbish, not only does it go against Christian Doctrine but tells it's reads to willingly go against true biblical teachings. All I can say is if anyone is talking on behalf of God, you should be very carefully to know all the fact behind the person's agenda and intent."
5,More than a conversation,"I purchased this book after I saw the movie......the movie was the appetizer and the book (volumes 1-3) is a delightful, savory, thought provoking, life changing main course that you can't get enough of. This is an important book for this time, I pray that people can really wrap their heads and hearts around this and affect a positive change in their individual lives, the planet and in the universe. This book could affect a ""do over"" for humanity if people open up to all this love, drink it in and pass it on. His new book ""Happier than God"" I think will be a sumptuous desert. I recommend this book every person on this planet."
5,life changing,"I have read this book and I was completely touched by it. Donald Walsh is an incredible author, asks the perfect questions and has very clear and clever style. This book has changed my life altogether. Even if you're a skeptic this deserve your attention as it will make you think hard about the way you've been taking life.I will re-read this book over and have made every conscious effort to live my life by its words. In his conversations Donald exposes us to the other side of traditional beliefs, challenges our ideals and mores and pushes us to look at the bigger picture. Oh boy! how big that picture is...This is an incredibly enlightening book that will alter any person's small way of thinking. If you understand it and enjoy it, then this book was meant to fall in your hands.Blessed are the ones that are lead to this series of books. This is a trilogy; all 3 books must be read and preferably bought as a set or as one large condensed book like the one described above."
2,good start,Like many of the recent reviewers of the separate books these books are a good general starting point on the spiritual search. They will start the mind to open to other possibilities. They are however just that- ideas to start but not much depth which is probably a good thing at this stage of the journey. A more advanced reader will however find nothing new here but rather old and simple.
5,OH MY (Conversations With) GOD!,"Well, if you have read any of the ""Conversations With God"" books then you can relate to my enthusiasm. But what a great concept, to include 'Books 1, 2, and 3' in this volume. Whether you utilize it as a reference to revisit the wisdom of the series, or give this collection as a gift to a loved one who is being introduced to the series for the first time, this is a priceless ""must own"" in my opinion for everyone's library. This is far and above the absolute BEST book(s) I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing!"
2,"How can you call this the ""Complete Conservations""??","This is only Books 1-3, yet the title says it's the COMPLETE CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD. If so, it should have included Friendship, Communion, New revelations, Tomorrows God and CWG for Teens! Very misleading title."
5,Conversations With God-a delightful book,"Before purchasing this trilogy, I had read the first book (Book One) and found it entrancing. I had previously thought that ""The Aquarian Gospel, by Levi"" was the greatest book I'd ever read, It now takes second place."
4,Breakthrough revelations,A brilliant book with deep deep insights on who we are and what is our purpose on earth.I am so grateful to have read this book.
5,only for the open minded!,"when i was told about this book i laughed...because of the title i thought it was a 'geek'... but a friend asked me to 'trust her on that and just give it a try' so i did. picked up the book at barnes&nobles and couldn't stop reading.... there was a moment when i wanted to throw it against the wall or burn it (since i have been raised on the holocaust trauma) but i decided to continue reading... if you let yourself think outside the box and leave aside all the judgments you've been taught to accept as truths, you will find this book extremely interesting and liberating. thank you mr. walsch for your courage in the world where everyone wants to impose god made in their image on us..."
5,Good deal,"All three books together for a Great price, they were in good conditon, no complaints here! Good pick for anyone!"
5,"Conversations With God, Books 1,2 3","This book has earned a permanent place on my book shelf. (I keep giving away copies and buying more - but one will always be in my possession!) It's one of the best kept secrets. Why haven't I heard about this book before?! It is revolutionary, deep, and can change your life. A must read!"
2,Walsch is his own God,"This is a clever and well written book that will appeal to anyone who wants to create God in his/her own image. It is not the God of Islam or Judeochristianity, but rather the God of hedonism and self. If you're into this sort of thing, this is the trilogy for you!"
1,Use caution,When a book strongly goes against the Bible I know that prayer is needed to discern who this man was speaking with. God always has and will be holy. Can anyone really think that a just and perfect God will let a mass murder of many Jews enter in heaven? Jesus always has and will be a perfect judge! Could this man have received info from Satan instead of God? If there is no judgment day then why have any law civil or divine? Remember the old saying let your conscience be your guide!
1,Reader Beware!,"Does anyone wonder why this author is so popular? Why all the high ratings? Is it because the books made people 'feel' good about themselves and their beliefs? I stopped reading this series when I couldn't stomach any more of this guy's stream-of-consciousness hot air. Where are the skeptics? They're not here debunking New Age dribble like 'Conversations With God' because it's not worth their time and effort. Please, people, read something like Carl Sagan's 'Demon-Haunted World; Science as a Candle in the Dark!' Where is your skepticism in this incongruous world? Just because you 'feel good' about something doesn't prove it has truth to it. And to think that Mr. Walsch is filling his coffers over and over again selling this garbage!"
1,He's NOT God!,"This guy is not God and he can not answer these questions from God's point of view. Anyone who says this book will change your beliefs clearly does not have strong Christian beliefs. With many answers the author simply gives readers what they want to hear, not Bible-based answers. There is a difference between right and wrong and God forgives all of us. The author claims there is no difference so there is nothing for God to forgive us for. Please don't let this book fool you into thinking you are reading the words of God. If you'd like to truly learn God's word then pick up a Bible!"
5,It can only be God's message.,"I just have to thank God I had the chance of reading such a wonderful book. I recommend it to everybody. If one knows a little about the Bible's content, or the Upanishads, or any other holy book, feels that they speak the same language as in 'Conversations with God'. It's intelligent, innovative, truthful, consistent, and a lot more. I can think of no one else but God to have designed such strong and shaking messages. I believe that when you are ready, the book ends up in your hands for you to read it, not before."
5,Walsch,This set is a must for anyone on a journey to improve your life and soul. It's a great addition to anyone's spiritual and inspirational library.
5,The complete conversations with God (Boxed Set),"Beautiful presentation. Fantastic book to read....it sets the mind ticking over. It has made me look at life differently and to think differently. I now think with my heart and soul and I do not take what people tell me as gospel....my belief in God is now so strong, I am no longer confused and afraid...a must book for everyone to read."
5,Fabulous spiritual guide to the modern life,"I started reading this book at the age of 18, when I was very confused with my life. After I finished the book, I realized that my attitude towards life is changed and found that life is full of happiness and love rather than sadness and fear.I recommend everyone who is looking for answers in his/her life to read this book and just read it as you read a novel and enjoy it. Later, you'll realize that it is a very precious series of books."
5,Great triology package.,This triology would make a great gift for someone you care about. This one really makes you think about what we have been taught our whole lives.
5,CwG - Boxed Set,"Having read the first book twice and starting a third time when the complete set arrived, books 2 and 3 were as thought provoking as the first. Currently on second re-reading of 2 and 3 as the more I revisit these conversations the more, it seems, I get out of them. For those that have questions about God then these texts offer some of the most exciting and lucid answers I have ever come across. A must read for anyone, of any denomination, that is searching as this will enhance your conversation with God."
5,Conversation with God series,This book is a must read for everyone. Keep an open mind and enjoy the messages provided in it's words.
5,Inspirational Reading,I bought this book as a gift for my best friend. She loved it so much she suggested that I read it and I did. I'm not a religious person and I enjoyed it deeply.
2,BIT DISTURBING,"While I loved the movie and was very interested in the different perspective, I found myself rather disturb by the word-games that essentially contradicted themselves through out the portion of the book I have read thus far. For example, early in the 1st chapter, the writer indicates that God told him that we are NOT here to learn...and yet in the same chapter some pages later, he indicated that God told him that we are here to experience. Learn=experience, that is what experience is all about. I am finding myself becoming suspicious of the content. I am happy for the man if it improves his life, but there are some very ""esst"" new age kind of stuff in here - ""every one is responsible for hunger"" for example. Not sure this is the book if you are looking for clarity and truth on a spiritual domain. Something feels ""wrong""."
1,What a bunch of self-righteous crap!,"No true Christian would ever buy this. God is not saying any of this! The author is projecting his own opinions as the voice of God. These books are false doctrine! What is sad is that people truly searching for God's word may come upon this baloney and really believe these are God's words, especially young people. These are not God's words! And shame to Scholastic for carrying these books at their school book fairs! I know there is freedom of speech, but if you are going quote God, you had better get it right. You will have to face God on your judgement day!"
1,Danger,"Read Galatians 1:8-10.Not even an angel can dare to speak for God. According to Jude 3, the Faith was once for all delivered. The Bible is God's final word to mankind and stands as well now as it did when it was written. It is terribly presumptuous to dare to speak for God outside His Word. Hebrews 4:12-13 tells us His Word is living and active. God speaks through the Bible to people today. There is one message for all mankind. That message is that Jesus saves the obedient who let Him be their Lord and do not assume they can rule their lives. John 20:30-31; Matthew 10:32; Luke 13:3; Matthew 28:18-20;Acts 2:36-38. How fearful to make up words for God to speak! Hebrews 10:30"
1,Wow,"""This book represents the outcome of twenty years of work by a distinguished international research group whose members have been communicating through psychic transceiver, Phyllis Schlemmer, with an enlightened circle of universal beings known as the Council of Nine."" and it's out of print......?"
1,... discriminates against readers opinion-Longmont Co.,"Why would ... not provide voting options for my review? I am a customer who has read this book. Even though I am the only one who has given an accurate review of this book. Maybe their sucked into the astral stuff as well. If you want a good counter balance to these other opinions, I recently read The Stargate Conspiracy by Lynn Picknett/Clive Prince. These Nine are just astral pranksters in my opinion and are using the channeler- she does not have the discretion to know the difference in astral and real cosmic LIGHT beings. This is so obvious if you really READ the book. The recent book Stargate Conspiracy goes into detail about their mis-information which confirmed what I already believed- it's just plain old garbage- designed to manipulate the naive into a hidden agenda.Let's see if ... prints this."
2,Disappointed by the Bard,"Wish there was a 1 1/2 star option, because this is definitely not even a 2 star book.My main problems were her poor characterization of Puck, the absolute inability to ever include the ""r"" in any instance of the word brought (which happens to occur on just about every other page,) and the general lack of editing. The story itself wasn't bad, and I even found myself wanting to know what was going to happen with Will, but in the end, I was just completely underwhelmed."
3,Never finished,This book was judst not for me. Not sure why but just couldnt get into it or stay with it. Never finished it
2,Cool but...,"This would be a cool little gadget if there weren't so many negatives. Takes a long time to charge, over 12 hours and you have to use your computer. Lot of issues getting it to work right. Whatever you do don't call Archos customer service, they'll make it worse. Relatively inexpensive initial purchase but if you want the full features plan on another $300. Can't record without the DVR station. I returned it, just too many problems. Didn't want to spend hours trying to get it to work properly. I must say that Amazon's return procedure is fantastic. Very happy with Amazon not with Archos."
4,Best bang for the buck,The memory card slot allows me infinite numbers of movies. I can record them off the tv with the dock and watch them on tv or the Archos. It can display all my photos. I think it the perfect portable entertainment device.
2,good but misleading,"First, the good news. This player does an excellent job of playing movies, and the music quality is superb as well. It allows for easy access to the controls, organizing your music can be as simple or complex as you want, and transferring files is very easy and fairly quick. Having the SD card slot allows basically infinite storage space.Now, the bad news. I bought this over many other options because it could access the web thru an Opera browser, so said the ad copy. This is probably true, except that the browser is an additional purchase via the archos site, for an extra 29.99. This would not be so bad, except for the fact that the 605 is a discontinued product and archos no longer sells the browser. Furthermore, they are the only authorized retailer for the browser, so no one else sells it either.So, if you expect to perform half of the functions in the ad, forget it."
3,great !!!,The 605 wifi flash with sd slot works great. Only problem can not get it to work with sd card.
2,Questionable product stability,The first unit I received had a complete failure on the touch screen after a couple of weeks of usage. Amazon was very prompt in replacing the faulty unit.The second unit will mysteriously freeze on various tasks. In general the product should have been delayed in its release to the market given the numerous problems I have encountered so far with the product.
1,I Should Have Listened to the Negative Feedback!!!,"My son wanted an MP3/Video player that wasn't an iPod, and had a large screen. The Archos 605 seemed like a great choice. My research revealed some positive reviews/feedback, and plenty of negative feedback and horror stories. I wanted to believe the good reviews... but shouldn't have! Within 48 hours of receiving the unit for Christmas, it had frozen. We stepped through the recovery procedures on the screen, but nothing worked. We returned it to Amazon. Amazon handled the return extremely well. Stay away from this product!!!"
2,Portable Media Player,No matter how many times we load this player it keeps on droping everything.It was returnHad it 1 week then put it back in box
5,ARCHOS 605 WI-FI PORTABLE MEDIA PLAYER,IT WAS GREAT AT FIRST. IT WAS SOMETHING ADVANCED FOR IT TIME. SINCE THE IPADS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THE UNIT IS NOW OBSOLETE AND I DO NOT USE IT ANY MORE.
5,Excellent !,This product is perfect to record video and music.It's easy to transfer our record to our PC too. Excellent !
2,"Reliability issues, non existant support","Bought a used one ( I have had several Archos products - 604 wifi, 704 wifi, another new 605 wifi)and really liked the bright screen and it's performance with video playback. For mp3 music, the volume is a little weak. Was working fine until suddenly it went into a death loop (a well known and documented one in various forums) - the dreaded error message and it asks you to repair, format but nothing happens regardless of which option you pick. Basically, I think the hard drive is not sturdy and once it crashes, it's done for. So, although I really like the unit, can't recommend it especially now that so many other units of similar functionality (including Android and new Win 7 mobile systems) are available from other reputable vendors. I believe Archos is a French company and I think it's true about French being stuckup and arrogant because their support site is worthless."
3,That's quite a stew!,"Rene Goscinny, Asterix and the Laurel Wreath (Dargaud, 1972)Vitalstatistix's brother-in-law comes to town, and during an argument, Vitalstatistix claims that he'll make a stew seasoned with Caesar's laurel wreath. Asterix and Obelix to the rescue! The problem is that, in order to get into Caesar's palace, they need to pose as slaves in the slave market, and get bought by an exceptionally odd family... one of the minor Asterix books, but it's a lot of fun, a very enjoyable read. ***"
5,A good Collection of Asterix Adventures,This Bind-up contains the following stories: 1)Asterix the Gladiator 2)Asterix in Switzerland 3)The Mansion of the Gods 4)Asterix and the Laurel Wreath 5)Obelix and Co. This collection of stories complements the other bindup books namely: Absolutely Asterix and Asterix Forever. A fun read. Will keep you entertained.
4,Adventures Could Have Been Better Selected,"Every Asterix adventure is a fun read, so I loved all 5 adventures in this collection, viz., 'Asterix and The Laurel Wreath', 'Asterix in Switzerland', 'Mansion of the Gods', 'Obelix and Co', 'Asterix The Gladiator'.However I thought the stories could have been arranged more thematically. None of the adventures in this book share any common theme. Eg, 'Asterix and the Laurel Wreath' and 'Asterix and the Chieftan's Shield' belonged together in one collection, or, 'Obelx and Co', 'Asterix and the Roman Agent', and 'Asterix and Caesar's Gift' belonged together, as they all deal with the Romans' attempts to sow discord in the Gaulish village we all know very well.But, on the whole, no regrets with the stories themselves. All rate 5 stars!"
5,Still the best after all this years.,Just read it and you'll find out why several people still read this humorous comic book.
1,Save your money - learn how to wash your horn!,Spitballs don't do much toward cleaning brass instruments. Ask your teacher to show you how to take apart your horn and explain how to wash it in the bathtub. It's easy and much better for your instrument!
2,gets stuck,"Hey everyone, its your band buddy vamp again. I don't recommend this product because the spitballs get stuck in the trumpet/brass instrument. I don't know if anyone has ever taken a trumpet completely apart to get one of these out, well other than me of course, but it is darn near impossible to ""snake"" these out once they are stuck. I had to run the valves under the bath tap (at full pressure) to get the darn ball unstuck. When the spitball gets wet, it expands...yea. So just use a snake rag and call it a day."
2,not worth it.,sounded like a neat idea for the low price I got it for. doesn't really do much and got stuck in my lead pipe right before I had to play. The idea is cool but better off cleaning the standard way with a pipe brush when needed..
1,waste of money!!!,"This is a waste of money. They didn't work on either of my trumpets, the 27 year old one or my 1 year old horn. The spitballs got stuck in both of them immediately. Also, they are a pain to get out. Don't waste you're money!!!"
1,Get your trumpet cleaned!,Need I say more...if it is dirty get it cleaned at a music shop. Ifyou play your horn a lot you will be best to bring it to a music shop once a year and pay the $30-$50 to get it cleaned. If you have a professional instrument it will cost more. I know these sound appealing and seem so much cheaper then a cleaning. Let me know what you think when they are stuck inside your instrument... inevitably these will not clean much at all and you will end up at the music shop.
3,OK for studying but not much use for signing out,"I bought this book with high hopes based on the promotional material from the publisher. But this text seems geared more for the medical student or resident learning hematopathology. The text is very concise but hardly encyclopedic. The images are in color and adequate, but a practicing pathologist will get many more useful images (and ""tips"") from Foucar's text. This book was inexpensive, and I occasionally pull it off the shelf.....but I almost always have to pull another more ""meaty"" text to answer difficult questions. Sometimes, you get what you pay for..."
4,Glimpse Into Humanity,"On several occassions, I found myself getting choked up while reading this book. It is intensly personal and we're lucky to be provided with an up close view of what Bruce Edwards and those who loved and worked with him went threw. Experience is a hard thing to acquire, unless you actually have it. This book offers a rare exception to its reader."
4,Everyone loved Bruce,Very good insight to the life of Bruce Edwards and the meaning of friendship. Good read.
5,walked past this book in every airport but finally.....,"I like Feinstein's writing (especially his book about the US Open) but I didn't see a whole book on this subject. Finally stuck in an Omaha airport, I broke down. And it has been an enjoyable read. You really come to care for Edwards and appreciate his love of the game, his profession, the Tour atmosphere and Watson. It is a book that is hard to put down and one that is hard to leave behind once you are done."
5,Caddy for Life: The Bruce Edwards Story,"The book all golfers should read, find out the men behind the clubs and the man that not only carries the bag of clubs but is really a big part of the game. Bruce Edwards fight again ALS and the fight that goes on behind the scenes of the game of golf. A must read-Larry Hobson - Author- The Day Of The Rose"""
5,Rather Gehrig's disease than Liberace's!,"Never quitting what he was passionate about, that was Bruce Edwards. Certainly he was passionate about caddying, about caddying for Tom Watson, passionate about always being upbeat and humorous. ""AT least Lou Gehrig was a great athlete. I'd rather tell people I have Gehrig's disease than Liberace's disease.""He set standard for pro caddies before finding out he had this dreaded killer.This consumate team which had been through so much thrilled the sporting world at Olympia Fields. Watson's passion for his friend and his plight.Feinstein's wordsmithing of this unique relationship and its unfurling from a fateful incident where hhe missed out caddying for veteran Dale Douglass only to chance upon a new upstart yound college grad from Stanford.The rest is golfing history and told so well in this engaging and emotionally charged book.May it inspire much good in the game and for this dreaded killer of a disease."
4,Good book--but....,"This is a good book. If you want to find out more about the terrible disease that killed Bruce Edwards, readHIS BROTHER'S KEEPER: A STORY FROM THE EDGE OF MEDICINE by Jonathan Weiner."
5,Pure Trombone Goodness,I find myself listening to this marvelous CD day in and day out. You will not soon grow tired of listening to J.J's fanatstic sound and simply superb improvisational skill! He is easily one of the best jazz trombonists ever.
2,Disappointing. They really cheapened this product!,"The ""most critical"" review says:Do not buy for the Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange!The picture and description is NOT accurate for this product as the shipped package replaces Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange with Wild Berry and True Blueberry!- - -A few years back I bought a box of 6 packages of the Fruit Tea Sampler and it was different. As stated above, they have now replaced two of the flavors with cheaper fare. I looked at the graphic before ordering a few days ago and it said 18 tea bags. I wondered how they could do this. What I got before was 5 flavors, 4 tea bags each. Yes, 5 times 4 = 20. How did they get 5 flavors and only 18 tea bags? Well, I found out today when I received the package, the obvious fact being that two of the flavors only have 3 tea bags, being two of the better flavors, Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion. Doh!"
2,Not as pictured.,I was looking forward to try cranberry apple flavor but when I received my samples the boxes contained blueberry and mixed berry flavors instead of cranberry apple and tangerine orange. Quite disappointing.
1,Big Disappointment,The Fruit Sampler Tea was a big disappointment--more than a year past the freshness date! I'm a new Amazon customer and didn't realize that this is the type of product they sell.
2,Terrible Hot - Kind of OK Cold,"I did not enjoy a single one of these flavors as hot tea. They seemed way to sweet and too strong of a flavor even in a large mug. Cold they are better but not great. To me it almost had a watered down kool-aid taste to it. So maybe a good choice if you're looking for a healthy alternative that kids will enjoy drinking. Other than that, I would not recommend."
5,It's Tea! ! !,"What can u say about a herbal tea sampler that hasn't already been said. Tasy, smooth, satisfying, good value,. . .i think that about says it all."
1,Not the flavors that were promissed...,"I bought this sampler specifically because I already love the cranberry-apple flavor and thought I would like the others too. Well, the package I received did not include the cranberry-apple (as listed in the product description) and it also did not include the tangerine flavor which I was looking forward to trying. Instead it has blueberry and wild berry, both flavors that I'm not excited about. I have tried a few of the flavors and they are pretty strong, fake fruit taste which is not what I was going for. In the future I am going to stick to the cranberry-apple, which is delicious."
3,The variety leaves much to be desired.,"I am a big fan of Celestial Seasonings fruit teas and I can say the same about the sampler. However, the product is not as described, as you will not receive the Cranberry Apple Zinger or Tangerine Orange Zinger. Instead, you receive Wild Berry and True Blueberry, the latter being a flavor that I'm really not fond of. The proportions are also not equal, as you receive 4 teabags in 3 flavors, and 3 teabags in the more popular flavors (Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion, two of my personal favorites). Also, the price has increased from around $15 back in September to almost $18 as of today, and it isn't worth it for the limited variety."
1,GHOULISH CHRISTMAS,This Christmas book is good enough -- certainly better than the TV movie later made from it. But please remember that the story is only barely fictionalized; the person on whom the author based her narrator was a real person who always thought the characterization borrowed more closely from his words than the author had originally indicated she would. So realize that this cutesy tale is also in extraordinarily bad taste -- as much about grave robbing as about Christmas trees.
3,The Christmas Tree,"I thought the book was a sentamental flick. It's a good quick book. I guess it was nice and interesting. Not quite boring but then again not the action-packed book. It was a heart warming story. Any age would like it, but it's most effective if you read it around Christmas Time."
2,Deceiving...,This product said it was a brand new edition in great condition...that was a lie. Not only did it have water damage it also had spilled red ink that stretched across approximately 10 pages.
5,Wish it were still in print!,"This is a sweet, wonderful story! I received it as a gift in 1997, and ever since have been givings copies to friends at Christmas time."
5,Harry Belafonte brings back to me my childhood,"I heard this song when my father played it in his gramophone during the Nigerian civil war. I was thrilled when, as a 4 year kid, I started dancing to the tune. Especially the song ""Day O"". I am looking forward to the day I will meet Belafonte. I will thank him for reserving the memory of my childhood as a 35 year old man.Fred Ejike Anigbogu"
4,A review,"I ordered it, it came within a week. Condition was very good. I was charged just what I had agreed upon."
2,Harry Belafonte,I am a great fan of Harry Belafonte but this CD did not match up to his others. Just did not have the feel of Belafonte.
4,One of the finest Arctic-themed memoirs in years.,"Crisply written, with just enough self-effacing humour and personal narrative mixed with the action, to draw readers into comfortable familiarity, ""Snowshoes and Stethoscopes"" is a wonderfully insightful chronicel of the author's adventures as one of the last true ""Flying Doctors"" in the frozen frontiers of the Northwest territories. The reader is drawn into a personal unfolding of this immigrant doctor/pilot's fears and excitement as he tackles isolation which most doctors and pilot's would shy away from. ""Snowshoes and Stethoscopes"" was a book that has kept many readers entranced fron start to finish and the only crtiticism has been a desire for more stories of this frozen north. The pictures are beautiful and haunting and very real, all well described and fitting into the narrative. The book is a lovely production and the cover design has been entered in a competition by the printer. Good value. Diana Haschke (Nelson)"
3,Good for review but not as an initial learning book .....,"I bought this book because it was a requirement in my Con Law class. However, I quickly found out that this isn't a book to use in order to actually learn Con Law. First, I just didn't find the book readable. I became lost in the cases and couldn't see the point the authors were trying to make. Secondly, although the book includes each major topic and the relevant important cases(s), the explanations on how this relates to the black letter of the law were difficult to understand. I agree with a prior reviewer that Chemerinsky's book is superior in this regard. So, if you are lost in the subject and want a guide to quickly bring you up to speed, this book will not help. However, if you've kept up in class or already have a basic grasp of the subject, this book is a decent quick review to refresh your memory (i.e., ""I remember that now"" - type of thing). I found this book much more useful after reading Chemerinsky first."
3,Getting the most bang for your Nutshell buck,"Although the Constitutional Law in a Nutshell is helpful, I got a lot more out of the Constitutional Analysis in a Nutshell book when preparing for my Con Law final. For those on a tight budget who don't want to spring for both books, I'd say spend your money on Constitutional Analysis, rather than this one. Use the case book and the analysis book for best results."
3,Its ok I like The Nicholas Strunk version better....,"Kelis is one of those artists that can make a hit and have it go for a while but when she teamed up with new comer uk artist Nicholas strunk from Michigan it was a blast better than the original album version. ""Millionaire"" was a blow up hit for Nicholas Strunk and Kelis Rogers. Hopefully Nicholas's Second album does way better than his first entering the charts at no.9"
3,these 2 should make a cd together,"I dig their colab dracula's wedding from the love below disc a few years back dre, and kelis sounds good together they have good chemistry to me anyway."
4,Great Product,I purchased this for air travel and I am so pleased. We were traveling to a colder destination and I was able to put our coats in with the carseat. After getting the bag off of the baggage carousel I was very glad that I had purchased it for the carseat because the bag was filthy. Had I not had this bag my carseat would have been the one with the filth. I am going to be traveling again next month and I look forward to using it again.
2,Synthesized Re-Recording,This album contains synthesized re-recordings of tracks from the movies. These are not the actual tracks using real instruments.Buy this album if you want to use it to sample some of the music from Arnlod's movies. Once you find tracks you like go buy the real album for that movie.
2,Not for serious dancers,"This tape is good for someone who wants to get to know the most basic steps in the 5 or 6 ballroom dances. If you don't know a thing about the ballroom dance and want a sanppy demonstration of the most primitive steps, go ahead and spend the... [money]. But if you are looking for at least a couple of moves in each dance so that you don't look like a robot on the dance floor, this tape will greatly disappoint you."
3,It was ok.,"Not bad, though the instructions are not that easy to follow at times, and you have to rewind the damn tape to view it again. Overall, you get your money's worth."
5,Fantastic,So much like my mother-in-laws food. Natives of Sao Miquel will love these recipes. We have enjoyed many of them.
4,Wonderful Introduction to Portuguese Cooking,"Buy this book for the stewed chicken and rice recipe alone... this one was a huge favorite at our house. This book is a great introduction to a wonderful but little-known cuisine, and should provide you with hours of cooking fun. One small caveat: the wine chapter has next to nothing about Port, Portugal's most famous contribution to the world of wine. I'm not sure how the author missed this... she did a fine and thorough job on everything else. But overall a fine book and one which even Emeril's mother Hilda could enjoy :)"
5,Beautiful book,I wanted to find a book with true authentic Portuguese cooking. This is is!! I had forgotten about some if the dishes from my childhood. This book brought it all back. The recipes are easy to follow. Well written. Love all the pictures and history too.
5,Authentic Portuguese recipes! Just like Avo made!,The best Portuguese cookbook I've come across. All recipes are authentic and easy to follow. It's a must in any 2nd or 3rd generation Portuguese household!
5,Brings back memories from my chllhood,"Finally, a Portuguese cookbook filled with authentic and culturally correct recipes from the mainland and the islands. I remember the delicious meals that my mother used to make and often I wandered how wonderful it would be to write down the ingredients to the tasty dishes before they were forgotten I thank the author for her wonderful work. We boiled a dozen lobsters last sunday using the ingredients found in this book. Everyone agreed it was the tastiest lobsters we had eaten. I have purchased a second copy of this book for my son who's getting married soon."
2,New Testament Bowdlerization,"WARNING: This self-proclaimed Scholar's Version (SV), would be more appropriately entitled the Politically Correct Version (PCV). If you are considering purchasing this book, you would do well to read these previous reviews: Buyer Beware (10/29/99), The Faulty Scholarship of the Jesus Seminar (09/03/00), A Collection of Gospels - What's All the Fuss About (12/03/00), Great Idea, but I Hate the Translation (04/19/01)."
2,New Testament Bowdlerization,"WARNING: This is not the self-proclaimed Scholar's Version it purports to be - it would be more appropriately entitled the Politically Correct Version (PCV). If your are considering purchasing this book, you may wish to read the following reviews: Buyer Beware (10/29/99), The Faulty Scholarship of the Jesus Seminar (09/03/00), A Collection of Gospels - What's All the Fuss About (12/03/00), Great Idea, but I Hate the Translation (04/19/01)."
1,Buyer beware!!!,"This book is not scholarship. In order to justify its political correctness (and make more money no doubt) the Jesus Seminar's minions continue to hand an under-informed society steaming piles like this book. It would be nice if this group of writers, which is so lacking in faith, would at least look at the facts. Unfortunately, the ""scholarly methods"" of the Jesus Seminar are so arbitrarily biased that I doubt this will ever happen."
5,Excellent Tool for One's Own Faith and Sermon Preparation,"I do lay preaching on occasion as well as a great deal of Bible study. This book helps with both. The broad range of ""possible"" gospels which are translated with good footnotes force on to reconsider what one thought was the bedrock truth of the church.Early Christianity was vibrant and far more varied than is the current version. It is good to know. The early Christians were trying to understand of what it was they were a part. The early gospels as well as other letters and scraps of documents illuminate faith exploration.After sermons, I have had a number of folk comment on how the information in this book made them think about their faith, rather than simply be somewhat robotic and zone out during the service."
2,This is a misrepresentation as a scholarly work.,"The Complete Gospels purports to be a translation of the Gospels that is ""free of ecclesiastical and religious control"", thus implying that it is free of bias from these sources. It is, however, replete with the editors' own elitist biases, including a slavish adherence to modern mores and political correctness."
2,But Can He Play the Organ?,"He may be a writer, but he can't play the organ...LOL! This is a nice little thriller centered around actor Miguel Ferrer who loses an organ and tries desperately to keep the other one. Though the theme is a little far-fetched, Miguel and heart-throb Leilani Sarelle Ferrer turn in quality acting performances...and a steamy relationship. The cover of the DVD box implies it may be a horror film...not so. It's just a quaint drama for adults. Miguel reminds me so much of Jack Webb of TV's ""Dragnet"" fame in the 50's. He rarely smiles...and has a cold demeanor."
3,the wife sure likes it,"I got this one for the Mrs. It made her really happy, which is nice. Brought back lots of fond childhood memories of sunday mornings, bacon and eggs and Jon Denver records. good times"
4,One of his best albums,"In my humble opinion, this is one of John's best albums, and one of my favorite. Every time I hear it I am transported back in time to listening to my parents' LPs as a kid on our junky little turntable. You can't listen to Back Home Again without feeling a little nostalgic for a simpler time when music was less about making a statement and more about feelings and love, family and home."
5,Every American needs this CD,The CD is great. It's all-American. The condition of the CD was great and the seller is reasonable.
1,Waste of Money,"After realizing mostly every song was a on a pervious record, I was very dissapointed. I thought this cd would be much better than his previous ones, and I couldn't wait to listen to it. In fact, I wish that I hadn't even wasted my money on this cd. If only I had ead the tracks on it before opening it, I'm sure I would have returned it. This is probably the biggest disappointment ever, and worst cd ever created..the fact that people are actually paying money for this is f*cked up."
5,Nelly is the Realist MC,"Sup playaz, any nelly fan needs this album, Derrty it up with Nelly and his hit Iz U, tha bomb all over. I was disapointed with the Country Grammar Remix...it sux. all though the Kings Highway is my Favorite, and Everyone needs to Bump this CD loudest!!!Play on."
1,Boycott Sellout Rappers!,"In ""Ova Here,"" his song dissing Nelly, KRS-ONE gives us some great advice: boycott sellout pop rappers and go to their shows to boo them off-stage. Let's start by boycotting this terrible album. Nelly has no skills and should not even have a contract, let alone a platinum album! If you want to hear some real hip hop, check out Immortal Technique's ""Revolutionary, vols. 1 & 2""!"
5,Nelly is back in action,If your a fan of rap music you need to add this to your collection. I wouldn't say its the best but its one good album to play over and over again. I like this album because its all reinventions. The best song is E.I. because its just one of the songs you can memorize easy. You should get Nelly Da Derrty Versions:The Renventions.
2,Nelly lost his touch,"i hate when rappers come out with a remix of their best tracks, it's so boring you've already heard the tune be4 but it's just fliped---nelly just changed some beats and added a fewe artist---there is a good side to the album tho' becuz it has the new hit single Iz U---even tho' this isn't nelly's greatsest track nor is it the worst-- the only reason you should buy this cd is you're bored of the original verson and wantto her the remixes or as nelly likes to say the renivationsp.s. go cop nellyville or country grammer first so u kno the differences w/ the remixes-"
1,Piece of Crap,"He just put a cd of songs he already made together. This cd sucks, he is jsut tryin to make some easy money."
2,No good,This Album is nothing like what I expected.I was expecting the same songs just with new people singing their own verse.Nope.It's almost the same words to diff beats.I'd understand if nelly was dead{as with the nu-mixx 2pac cd}but come on here he's alive.Make some new songs don't just edit ur old ones and call it a cd.
2,Not Worth It...No Effort,"This CD is not worth your money. Nelly has lost his talent obviously because now his CD's are going to be ""Reinventions"" of his old songs. Even ""Iz U"" is a terrible song, and it doesn't even grow on you. In my opinion, this CD is just another way of giving Nelly more money for nothing...Don't Buy It!"
1,Worst remixes I've ever heard...,"and I own SWV: The Remixes. The best of the new songs is ""King's Highway,"" and that's just being nice. The only redeeming guest spot on this album (with appearances by Kelly Rowland[just because she was on the original ""Dilemma""], Justin Timberlake, the man who thinks he's Mr. Biggs, Ronald Isley and others) is David Banner on ""Air Force Ones (RMX)"". And Nelly is the worst singer since P. Diddy tried to sing (see ""Pimp Juice [RMX]""). And this album is platinum?"
1,The Point Of This Album Is....,Who knows? Nobody wants to hear these songs for AT LEAST 6 years. Why would I want to hear songs I've heard a kabajillion times over and over? Moreover REMIXES...which aren't that good anyways. The songs are played out right now to the point of being annoying. We don't want to hear ANY of these songs for a long time coming. Nelly should just drop a new album and be done with it because he has enough catchy jingles to last a lifetime. Oh yeah... NO MORE REMIX ALBUMS for you Nelly!
5,Derrty,"This CD is awesome. All of the hits-re-done. ""IZ U"" is gonna be the new explosive hit from Nelly. The new ""Ride Wit Me"" samples John Mayer's ""No Such Thing"", one of the best tracks on the disc. ""Pimp Juice"" with Ron Isley gives a whole new meaning to Pimp Juice. Most every thing is reworked. Only ""Country Grammer"" is basically the same. Buy the CD, it's worth it, even if you own all Nelly anyway. You won't be disappointed."
1,Good for a laugh!,"If you want a few laughs, listen to this poor excuse for music. Trash like this is starting to make me miss the days of teen pop like Britney, Christina, Jessica, Mandy, NSYNC, BSB etc. Compared to Nelly they're all classic!"
2,Not as good as the originals,"I love Nelly but this cd is pretty disappointing... I was expecting this to be kind of a compilation with pumped up and funkier versions of his best stuff but to be honest, the originals are much better. I wish I had listened to a few tracks before buying cause I wouldn't have thrown out the cash."
1,Double UGH,"I totally agree with the reviewer from Anchorage, Alaska. This is one of the silliest books I have ever read and I cannot believe I plowed through the whole thing. Somewhere along the line, I have bought the next edition, The Nightingale Legacy, and I don't know whether I can stand to go through it or not.Sorry, Ms. C. I'm sure you are a best selling author, but your historical romances, at least that one, are for the birds. I'm currently reading The Target and it is a little bit more interesting and believable. Marcus, in the beginning was not remotely believable."
1,Painful...,"It's been a while since I've read a book I had to give up on half way through. The er...hero? Marcus is an abusive and immature man. Mocking his wife when she tries to get him to stop raping her, verbally abusing her after she does everything to help him, flaunting his mistresses, blaming her when she gets pregnant. This wasn't a romance. It was a study on the minds of abused women. Putting up with abuse in the name of love...ugh. I was to disgusted to continue reading, although I skimmed the last few pages and rolled my eyes at his inevitable declaration of love. Disturbing."
1,This book is more a tragedy than a romance,"I can't believe how wild, petty, and such a brood Marcus is. The new earl is such a child in character that I got bored after a hundred pages and threw the book away. This obviously was not thought out by the author. This is not a romance, but a calamity.Boo! Boo! on the author. This is terrible writing. I do not recommend this book."
1,blah,This book was so boring that I couldnt even finish it. Just because it's a romance novel doesnt mean that it has to be so badly written. In the time it takes you to read this book you might as well have written one of your own instead because just about anyone could do as badly and you'd probably have more fun writing your own anyway.
3,Just O.K...,Wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Marcus & the Duchess gave me many laughs but there wasn't really anything that made me want to keep going. There was a couple mysteries going on in the book & I didn't figure out who the villain was but I would've like better cliffhangers & more action. I was hoping to hear in the end that the 2nd mistress was made up but that never happened so I'm assuming that she was legit. Oh well! I hope the next 2 in this series are better then the first.
1,"Yeah, whatever...","Usually I like Catherine Coulter a lot, but this book was just plain weird. The characters made no sense at all, and Marcus was the most petty, meanspirited man ever. There was no reason for the two of them to have fallen in love, and the plot was so dull I can't even remember it. If you want to read good Coulter, try The Nightingale Legacy or the Bride trilogy."
2,okay...,"I am not really a big romance reader, but a friend told me I had to try Catherine Coulter. Well...I can see how some love her books, and how she apparently is such a popular writer. The Wyndham Legacy seemed more well-written and dimensional than most historical romances I have read. However, some of the characters were inane (Trevor??? and Aunt Wilhelmina?!!) and the romance...well, it seemed more the beginning of a domestic abuse story. Personally, Marcus (the lead love interest) seemed to me a horrible, abusive man whose only assets were his good looks. Also, Catherine Coulter seems to have uncontrollable urges for repetition...did we really need to be told again and again how ""still and lovely"" Duchess was? On the whole, it was an okay read...I think some people will probably love it, and I see why, but it's just not for everyone."
2,Typical yet different,If you like quirky stories and odd characters that aren't quite believeable; this is for you. At least not a struggle to read.
4,Great book...some Jacket wear,"This book is great. I was impatiently waiting for it but it took almost a month to arrive. I realized it came from overseas. Book has some very valuable photography, history of India from Independence until 1990's. Lots of older pics."
4,"Good writing, bad printing","I like the way this book is written, and I like the fact that the chapters are short, since many of my professors seem to like to pile on a lot of reading. The writing style is easy to read, but sadly the book is somewhat outdated, which happens rapidly in this field.What bothers me greatly is how badly printed this book is. The screenshots are faded out and a bit blurry because it looks like they copied the book rather than printed it. The chapter numbers on the right edge of the pages are partially cut off when you get to chapters with two digits, which happens when you make a copy of a copy. The grays are faded and the book looks like they were running out of toner when they used a laser printer. At this price, the book should be printed using a normal printing process, not some cheap copying method."
3,"Content is good, but book looks photocopied","The content in the book is good, just seems I was sold an bootleg or a photocopy of the actual book. The cover is more orange and faded, the inside pages are not in color at all, and all the pics look straight up photocopied. I really think its a bootleg book !"
5,Great workout pants!,"I love this athletic workout pants...they're very comfortable for the gym, to sleep in, or to just run errands. They are light weight and cut off just about the ankle (I'm 5'6), the only thing to remember is to order your correct size. I ordered a larger size and thought they might shrink in the wash...they didn't..so my pants are a little baggy...but still worth the price!"
4,workout pants,I do really like these pants. The only thing was that the length was odd... not quite long enough but not short enough to be capri. I ended up just cutting them about 4 inches to be shorter.
2,"Clown Pants, Not appealing enough to wear out of the house...","Personally I think the Russell Athletic Women's Gym Capri Pant should be known as the Russell Women's Maternity Pant. I have two options in wearing them - I can either allow the waist band to sit on my waist, unfortunately this means the crotch hangs at around my mid thigh. Or I can pull them up, but I really don't like pants that sit along my ribs, (from waist to crotch the pants are 13 inches!)The pants have a drawstring which is fairly redundant because the waistband is elasticised. I'd never wear these to the gym, and even as pyjama pants they're very unflattering. I like the colour and weight of fabric, but that is all."
4,capris,"Overall I am very happy with this purchase. The fit is great except they are longer then I expected. I may just be a little on the short side though so maybe it's just me. Very good for working out or just lounging around. Very comfortable. The price is great for what you get, I bought 2 of these. One blue and one gray. Color is true to pictures which is not always true for online shopping. I would recommend to others."
5,Versatile Capri Athletic Pants,"Being from the southwest...where we get quite warm tempuratures this light weight capri is just the ticket! Covers without being constricting, moves with you. I ordered several pair and am very happy with the product. Please note these are very lightweight some other reviews were disappointed with that however, I find that to be a benefit especially being from such a warm climate most months of the year. Washes well and I hang to dry."
4,Long pants for short people!,"These are comfortable, but be forewarned that it you're short (I'm 5'2"" with a 27"" inseam) they're going to be nearly full-length. The XL comes to about my ankles. (Yes, I know this happens when you're short, but even for capris, they are long. :) )."
3,OK garment,"the product was OK, the sewing at the end of the garment was weird, but overall the product is OK"
2,Capri? These go to my ankles. Thin material as well.,"I'm 5'4"" and ordered these XL so I have plenty of room for Tai Chi. Thing is, they really go down to my ankles. I don't usually wear petite sizes so this was strange. Also, the material is very thin, almost T-shirt thin, like inexpensive pajama bottoms. Had I not ordered them very large, I would have been embarrassed to wear them because they would show *every* *flaw*. As they are so loose on me they drape, as I ordered them, it's not a huge issue. I won't be returning them but chances are I won't be ordering any more, either.(Granted... they may be really long because they are too big, but I'm currently wearing a size 14-16 and XL is normally just loose. I've never had problems this bad with length before. I mean, look at the picture, I should have to go into 2X or so before they get long enough to touch the top of my feet.)"
4,"Great price, a little lightweight","I like these pants, and the price was great. The fit isn't as awful as other reviews made it seem. I did order it a size smaller, which was fine but now I'm afraid to put them in the dryer. They are pretty lightweight, though, which is fine if that's what you need. I also ordered the New York Laundry capri, and I like that slightly better (the NYL pair has racing stripes)."
5,Great for Homeschool,"While this game might not be the one the kids beg me to play with them, it is great as a change of pace from the usual math lessons with my 6 year old. I was pleasantly surprised with the durability of the cards."
4,"Yerba Prima Bentonite, Detox Pint","Very good for the skin, especially works good to prevent acne and to fix the one that just appeared. Probably best detox."
2,Didn't work for me,This product did not help my system but everyone reacts differently. It just upset my stomach and tasted pretty terrible.
4,Works!,I recommend bentonite for people that have bowl problems. I used it for only three days and have been very satisfied with the results. Psyllium tastes gross and made me gag but it helps the bentonite get the job done.
1,really really bad,this cd is the worst ever it has no point it does not concern The Lord Jesus Christ i am dicrased that this cd is concederd christian
4,It will be a great surprise,A Mother's Day present for my daughter. She has talked about this music for years and I found it on your site. Many thanks......
3,A blast from the past,"Mr Mister were the first band I liked enough to spend money on, and though my tastes have completely changed since then, I still can't resist a singalong to my old faves. Mr Mister, although slightly preposterous, pompous (especially the third album) and still known really only for ""Broken Wings"", knew how to write an energetic, dynamic and strangely funky tune, with a smidgeon of lyrical interest that should be no embarrassment to anyone who likes them."
2,the secret society of demolition writers,I was dissappointed. Many of the stories were based around sexually explicit themes. I was looking for something more imaginative than that from these authors.
5,Best aftershave ever!!,I have used St. John's Bay Rum for many years. It is without a doubt the best aftershave ever. My wife loves it because it smells fresh and clean without the overpowering odor you get with other aftershaves. I like it because it refreshes me after every shave and leaves me feeling refreshed and masculine. I wholeheartedly recommend it to any man who wants to break away from those aftershaves you can smell from 100 meters away.
1,Not worth the money,"This is a barebones edition that never should have been published. The original contains some 67 photographs, including a few very useful maps. They add immensely to the pleasure of reading Maillart's narrative. Aside from the cover, this edition contains none.Much better to search out an independent bookseller through [...] and buy an earlier edition with the photographs in parallel with buying an earlier edition of Peter Fleming's travelogue for the same trip. Though both authors describe the facts of the travel from Beijing to India along the southern Silk Road route, their descriptions of their inter-personal interactions and among the people they encounter along the journey are very different and complementary."
5,Excellent introduction to philosophy,"[I have a different, older edition of this book, so I can't comment on this particular publishing.]The Story of Philosophy is excellent. Durant provides pretty thorough and surprisingly interesting overviews (anybody who has read academic philosophy knows how boring and difficult it can sometimes be -- just try reading a few pages of Kant-- this is not so in Durant!) of many of the greatest philosophers, aptly tying them together and analyzing each. Read this along with Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosopher (broader, but less in-depth) and you will have a pretty damn good introduction to philosophy!There are some odd omissions, like David Hume or John Locke, but this is the only problem I can find in The Story of Philosophy. To contrast this, he includes some philosophers on whom you are less likely to find information, like Santayana (one of my favourites, though strangely unheard of in much of academic philosophy!) or Croce."
3,Good substance tainted,"While this work remains a fine compilation of the history, life, and writings of many fine philosophers, I could not help but be turned off by the unabashed arrogance of the author. Many times he seemed to almost pity the world's greatest thinkers, often insulting their character and suggesting that one must be a failed sociologist in order to be a philosopher.I would recommend reading it, for if you like philosophy you will appreciate this book as much as I do. Even the harping 'wit' of the author fails to sully this intriguing story worthy of at least a quick peek."
3,enough with the meandering digressions,"First of all who rights these books, Will or his Wife arieal? Im tired of them sharing credit cuz we both know they arnt both this prolific. The Durants are obviously well educated but when is someone going to put a stop to their/his/her desultory discursives. STAY FOCUSED. The author needs to introduce more structure into his work and stop talking about the Lyceum in one sentence and the influences of tuetoic incursions upon Aristotles ephemeral nature of the fully realized existance the next instince. Its like Bill Murray said in Strips ""when you start these little stories please have a point in mind."" Please."
4,Almost immaculate,Though the book was printed several decades ago but it looked like never been used and read. It was like brand new and well above my expectation.
5,a magnificent workthat will entice u to read more philosophy,"although a renowned scholar will durant and his wife ariel write like no other; with crystal clarity and conviction that make even the most complex and sophistocate ideas available to the ""layman."" I started this book before i read any philosophy and couldnt put it down! Will is a incredible writer and without any knoweledge whatsoever with philosophy i was able to understand his summaries of even kant! THis book drew me to philosophy so much that i sought out the original (but translated) works of most of the great western philosophers (voltaire, kant, schopenhauer, bergson, russel, etc.) and am now seriously considering becoming a professional philosopher!"
5,"I'm no book critic, However......","Will Durant takes years of boring philsophical history and turns it into a refreshing review of insight from all of the world's greatest philosophers. This book is intruiging, views each philosopher in different lights, and opens your eyes to the world around you. Whenever I finish reading this book, I start all over again, each time more interesting than the last."
4,Great Western Philosophy Intro.,"This book provides a great overview of western philosophy through discussion of the lives and opinions of the various philosophers. It insightfully draws connections between the events of the times and the way they helped shape each philosophy. It traces the development of western philosophy, showing how the differing views built upon each other. This is a great way to learn the core ideas of the philosophies, as a possible branching out place for further study; it does, however, require a bit of basic historic and literary knowledge for full comprehension."
3,Not expected condition,"3 stars because while this books may preserve physical integrity, aesthetically, it is terrible (ie nothing ""good"" about it). If I wasn't dying to continue reading this, it would be returned. I would have much rather paid an extra couple bucks for a copy that didn't truly show its age, such as this one does."
3,Old and limited,"This book is nearly 100 years old now. While called the Story of Philosophy, it really only covers European philosophers. It is, however, quite readable and a good introduction to the subject."
5,interesting handbook on a legendary flying wing,excellent reprint of the pilots manual of the yb 49 flying wing of the legendary mind of jack northrop.
2,Morgoths rng,"Most of book is made up of paragraph sized revisions, which was if I remember correctly not stated in book description. A portion of this book gives details and insigts that are just spectacular."
2,The taste needs to be revised,"Probably a good product but the taste is undesirable. Haven't used it much because no matter what you mix it with, the taste is always there/"
2,Post-it Notes Pads,"I thought I was purchasing 3 X 5 Post-It Note Pads with ""lines""...... I guess I should have known the definition of ""Original Pad"" .............Additionally I would have thought each pad would have been wrapped individually .............. but no......... they were all just put in a shipping envelope loose..........."
5,Added to the whole series.....Putting on The Ritz!,"I just returned from London where I enjoyed the ""Ritzual"" of Tea in the gorgeous Palm Court. This is my second time and even with the insane prices with the weakening dollar I would still do it all over again. This book is a great reminder of that very special event for my 50th birthday. Try to collect the whole series-wonderful, wonderful!"
2,somewhat disappointed,"I purchased the London Ritz book in the hopes that it would give me more ideas on how to host a tea party...I did see some (not many) tea sandwich receipe...mostly information on how tea parties were held in ancient times. My opinion, if you are trying to do a tea party and need ideas on ""how to do"", this is NOT the book for you."
2,Tiny book,I must have misread the book discription as I was expecting a coffe table book and received something the size and thickness of a children's book. This will not be the Christmas gift that I had intended it to be.
1,"Sacrificed Quality for the Sake of ""Pretty""","Unfortunately this book fell way short. It had a lot of recipes in a type of font that was so fancy you couldn't read it. I think they valued the curly cues of the font more than the legibility. The majority of time they squeezed two recipes on one page in a 4 x 5.5 book.I understand Afternoon Tea is supposed to be delicate and dainty, but does a book on Afternoon Tea have to be delicate and dainty too, or can it be a little more practical. I felt I needed to have some form of chiffon on my body just to read the book, which I couldn't read because the typeface is too small."
5,Good things do come in small packages,"Lots of easy, great recipes. If for no other reason, you should buy this book just for the basic english muffin recipe and scone recipes."
2,Two Masters,"I loved miss Ramsey first album great voice. this album disappointed me thought she was a gospel singer and now she is singing for the world which is not good you can not serve two masters you are either for him or against him ""No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."" Mt 6:24 And this is true I use to be a big fan of worldly music until i found Jesus. This album gets 2stars for her voice."
2,Self Titled by Tarralyn Ramsey,"The winner of Vh1's American Idol-esque competiton, Born to Diva, was *gasp* someone who actually deserved to win. Tarralyn Ramsey proves on her debut album that she indeed does have the pipes it takes to ""diva"", however she doesn't have the material to back it up. The album is very generic, over-produced hip-hop style R & B with a hint of a ghetto twist, evident on tracks such as the Murphy Lee featured ""Baby U Know"", ""Dolo"" and the albums opener ""Where You Are"", all of which sound like out takes from Christina Milian's debut. The album stumbles along the entire time being saved only by the incredible ballad ""Up Against all Odds"" & another ballad ""Made for You"" which showcase her vocal ability all while featuring a catchy melody. Good luck to her in the future, but with material like this I don't see life in the industry past this release."
2,Hummmm,"I have been waiting for this CD since she won Born to Diva! I have checked this site repeatedly to see when it would go on sale. I even asked Tarralyn when I met her here in Atl. I knew this was going to be good so I listened to it. Listened again and again. I cannot figure out how such a beautiful and powerful voice could get stuck with terrible songs! The two songs from Born were excellent (Against All Odds and Made for You). After that it is hard to digest. There are two or three other songs on there that you can sing along to while you clean, but nothing that you will hear and say, ""This is my song!"" Tarralyn's voice will give you chills, but unfortunately her producers did not have enough confidence in her to let it stand out. She sounds like the young Whitney Houston singing Backstreet Boys songs (overproduced and generic)."
5,Job well done,"I didn't know of Tarralyn before she appeared on Born to Diva, but quickly fell in love with her voice. She is indeed a truly talented young lady, and her cd allows her to show everyone just that. Don't get me wrong her debut self titled album (which i found out about after BTD) is good, but I think her voice has had time to mature and she know has more control of it. This cd is one you can put in, press play, and take it all in. She not only sings on the cd but makes you feel something on several tracks as with ""Made for you"", ""10,000 thank you's"", and of course ""Up against all odds"". You also get to see how versatile she is with a few up tempo songs such as ""Baby u know"" and ""Dolo"". Overall, I would recommend this cd to anyone who has a ear for music and knows what true talent is. Tarralyn, you have out done yourself, but one thing....... don't make us wait so long next time!!!!"
4,what it says,I purchased this game to replace the one I already had that had a crack in it and lots of scratches.
1,Shipping!?!?!?!?,"When i ordered this game, is was really happy to get it because it had the D-Day mission. When I ordered, I chose standard shipping 3-5 days. Guess what. I recieve my game 1 1/2 week later. The game came LATE! Still the game was fun but dissipointed on shipping"
3,old school...emphasis on old,Ol graphics ol action and ol experience. These games should be redone in new format and new graphics and they would be great again.
2,A poor representation of great artist,"Hold out for better, guys. This thrown-together collection is mighty weak and will only satisfy the beginner fan. I must agree with the naysayers: so much is missing. How bout that hot live version of ""America"" he did with the juicy horn line? How bout ""Partyman""? What about that outstanding live version of ""Anotherlover holeinyohead"" (with another killer horn line)? ""Batdance"" showing his own original concept of good vs evil? Plus the ones already mentioned by other reviewers? All of these were released as videos back in the day. How bout those killer appearances on the AMA & grammy shows (baby I'm a star then purple rain, respectively) in the mid 80's? Some behind the scenes stuff would be nice. That's what DVD format is made for, folks. If u don't do it right why bother? Warner Bro has all these videos, I assume. Why play a major artist (and his fans) so cheap?"
3,You call this a collection?,"All In got to say is, WHERE THE HELL IS ""WHEN DOVES CRY""? That'sthe main reason I purchased this so-called collection (and I use the term ""collection"" loosely).I was very disppointed when I saw that it wasn't on here.That is Prince's most famous song. But on the other hand, you get some classics like ""kiss"",""rasberry beret"" and ""little red corvette"". But don't take my word for it, buy it yourself.You might actually like it."
3,THE ARTIST deserves better,"the songs offered here are not the best of Prince's catalog and these videos are not the best of what he's done. Where's 'When Doves Cry""? Where's any performance of ""Purple Rain""? The selection of songs are weak! I'm a devout Price fans but ""Cream"" and ""Uptown"" should be on NO ""hits"" collection."
5,Prince is the Best,I give this DVD 5 Stars because...Its Prince! It has a great selection of music videos and shows the timeline of Prince's talent and performance! MUST BUY!
1,"""When Doves Cry"" Is Missing?","Then why bother? This is terrible for the true Prince fan, Warner needs to come out with a better DVD compilation... Truly disappointing!"
2,I thought about buying this but,"There were just to many GREAT videos missing! Why U Wanna Treat Me So Bad, Sexuality, Automatic, When Doves Cry, America, Mountains, Anotherloverholenyohead, Glam Slam, I Wish U Heaven, Batdance, Scandalous, Partyman, Thieves In The Temple, Money Don't Matter 2Nite, and The Morning Papers. Glam Slam was a great video, and Batdance was a #1 Hit. I'm also disappointed that it did not have the Thieves In The Temple video. The Graffiti Bridge DVD only includes the edited version."
3,Only if you LOVE prince,"This dvd is just ok. The quality of the performances is uneven. the collection streches from his early immature persona (controversy) right on up to his more polished presentations (7). there is no systematic ordering of the material, so watching the dvd offends the senses. There are no special features to speak of. No dolby digital here... linear pcm only. In addition there is only 61 minutes of entertainment, pretty weak considering the immense talent (and history) of this performer."
2,A grave dissappointment.,"I am surprised an artist of Prince's supposed stature could allow such an embarrassing, poorly chosen, badly transferred selection of ""hits"" to be released under his name. Most of the best songs and videos are omitted, and instead there are loads of awful filler tracks filmed in mock-concert style - yeuch!The worst of the 80's are here. Such a missed opportunity - it could have been brilliant."
3,DRAMA & MORE DRAMA,"I enjoyed reading Sonia Caulton's ""No More LoveMaking"". We meet Dede who is currently ""in love"" with Stephan her boyfriend of 3 years. She is having major problems with him and confides in her co-worker and backstabber ""friend"" Dionne. Dionne is tired of listening to Dede whine about her ups and downs with Stephan so she tells her best friend Charlotte Although she doesn't feel like she is being disrepectful in her friendship with Dede....Charlotte decides to take this little bit of information and run away with it.This is a good read and I actually would rate it a 3.5, however it was a little drawn out and could have been a little more neatly wrapped up in the end. I wish continued success and blessings to Sonia Caulton."
5,My very first record at age 14 and became my jazz standard,"After seeing this movie with my buddys, we all put balloons onfor our bicycle spokes and became the RRBC(Red Rebels Bicycle Club),named of course after Brando's BRMC.When the 10' vinal came out (had Roger Short and Manny Shelllisted as two the arists on the back), I bought it on the spot and listened to it over and over well into my adult life. I am age 63 now and still I listen to this CD in my car often. This jazz is part of what makes me who I am ...to my very core. I have also purchased alot of Shorty Rogers and other bebop and West Pacific jazz of the 50's and love it all almost as much. But THIS music is most assuredly my standard for really good listening jazz."
3,The Wild One not so wild,"I was electrified by Leith Stevens' superb score for this 50's youth-in-rebellion classic. Unfortunately, release recordings for film scores don't always measure up to the scores actually featured in the film--even under the composer's direction. The selections on this album simply lack the wonderful anarchic energy and pizazz with which the movie itself rocked. I was also disappointed that some parts of the score, such as the meloncholy finale, were not even represented here. If you haven't seen the film, you may still enjoy this recording."
3,not so good,"i have the greatest respect for Dr. King. i expected this book to take a philosophical view towards measuring a man--- a philosophical view that emphasizes more on a certain methodism that values reason over passion. now, i understand Dr. King is a preacher and strongly believes in christianity. this book is a sermon. therefore, as someone who accepts christianity but not really endorses it to visit the church every sunday, i wouldn't have bought this book if i knew what perspective it would take. so this book is an excellent measure of a man, but it would be more preferable if it takes a different central figure other than God to measure a man. at least to me. its a very thin book by the way, more like a long essay."
4,Small and Handy,"Small and slim, fits in the back of pants pockets just fine.About 50-pages, with 10 or so pages in the middle solely having various photographs of King and followers.I read it in about 15mins, taking my time.Buy it used for the best deal. Paying full price for something so small that could probably be downloaded off the internet seems a bit much.It is very thought-provoking, as all of King's work, and is worth reading. Would make a great gift for anyone.I recommend ""A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr."" for a more complete work of Dr. King."
3,a bit too short,"King is as eloquent as always, and I knew this was a short book, but it was filled with a lot more pictures than I expected and it was more purely theological than connecting theology with his nonviolent philosophy. I'd go for something else if you want to read King."
4,quick delivery and quick read,I expected this book to be thicker and have more of the writings of Dr. King. Other than being disappointed in the length I was very pleased with this book.
4,Much nicer in person!,"I bought these for my Matron of Honor. I thought they were going to look childish, but they turned out very pretty!"
1,Never agian!,The cd won't play because it it a region 2 disk and was told by the company verry rudely after buying and trying to play it that it is for other countries like africa and japan. Now I'm stuck with it because they told me that they WON'T exchange it for one that will work . All I wanted was a movie for my 2 year old because she loves the show. p.s. they force you to put a star!!!
3,head of the family,"A pretty fun little movie that feels like one of the many horror/comedies of the 1980s. The characters are well drawn and the acting is above average. There isn't much gore if that is what you are looking for, however Jackylnn Lovell gets naked quite a bit. Overall this is a fun little movie that plays better with a nice little buzz."
4,Head,"I'm starting to see that Full Moon does 2 different types of movies: The Subspecies kind that are supposed to be full on horror and movies like this that are supposed to be weird, scary and comical. I really enjoyed HOTF. I liked the makeup and the story kept me interested. Good characters in that family. Oh yeah, that blond chick was pretty happenin' as well. Nice job by Charles Band and co."
4,Evil genuis,"By all accounts, this shouldn't be a great movie, or even a good one for that matter. And yet, I was amazed at how quickly I accepted the premise, the place, and the people in this wacky world. This is a carefully controlled, purposefully constructed film from start to finish. They created a world where all this lunacy makes perfect sense, and they didn't deviate from that one iota. I think that's why it works. They had a conviction and went with it.....with wild abandon. Everything matches, all the performances, the story, even the cartoon music that accompanies it; everything is pitch-perfect. It's hard not to have a begrudging admiration for what they made. They made a BIG head believable, and more importantly, funny.This is one time I'm glad I took a chance and went with all the glowing reviews posted here. I wouldn't have missed the opportunity to see this movie for anything. Bonus, I get to keep it for future viewing!"
3,Video and Audio transfer were both very good.,"The video transfer was excellent. No noticeable noise or other affects. The picture was crisp and clean.Audio was Stereo, 2 front speakers, but it sounded very good."
5,very pleased!,"Be sure to follow the instructions, and preheat the tortillas in a microwave with a damp towel first. It takes them considerably longer to bake than the instructions say (I set my timer at about 14 min.) However the result is excellent. Even my very picky 7 yr. old grand daughter liked them!"
5,Works great,Works as advertised. I don't understand how some are having a hard time figuring out how to use it.Another great Chicago Metallic product.
3,Great concept with little success,"Short and to the point. If you can keep the tortillas from sliding off of the rack it will crisp them as advertised. The problem is, they want to slide right off and fall on the rack or the bottom of the oven...Maybe some little ""teeth"" or something could help hold the shells in place?"
3,Chicago Metallic Baked Taco Rack,"It doesn't seem to do what I would like - a fresh, crispy corn tortilla; the ones from the grocery store are usually too stale, even when reheated, so I thought this would be great, but I am disappointed in it; I'm going to keep trying; perhaps flour will work better, but I've never used the kind you buy in the refrigerated section, so we'll see"
5,Love it!,"I love this product! The taste of a truly fresh taco is wonderful! It does take a bit of work as some of the other raters have mentioned. But to me it's worth it to have a fresh, healthy taco shell."
3,Probably Works w/Moderation,"I have the same problem with following the instructions to make corn tortillas more pliable. Others have suggested ways to make it work with wet paper towels in the microwave. It so much faster and easier to do this:Preheat oven to 325 F. and place yellow corn tortillas on the wire rack (centered over 2 wires with edges UNDER the others). Bake until they begin to turn a darker color, about ten minutes. They will curl around in an upside-down fat `U' shape to make perfect taco shells that make stuffing easy. Crunchy and chewy perfection.This is going to the Goodwill next opportunity so someone else can enjoy something ""brand new""."
4,Healthy Tacos Shells!,This is a great baking rack for small tortillas. I've baked only flour shells and they are crunchy and delicious. Something to keep in mind is baked shells will never taste like or have the texture of fried shells. If you're looking for a healthy option and are willing to give-up a little bit of the taste and texture - then get baking with this pan today!
3,"Nice idea, but it takes some work to get the tortillas to stay put...","I have been making my own corn tortillas and taco shells for a while now by frying them. But that method is a pain, and I wanted something a bit healthier. So, I ordered these taco baking racks. After warming the tortillas to soften them, I brushed them with a light coat of oil and put them on the racks. I had several of them slide off the racks and several cracked. It was work to get them to stay put on the racks until they were softened enough to take the shape of the rack and begin to crisp. I am going to try again, and this time invert the pan and use the V shape to hold the shells (at least that way they can't slip off.)"
4,Tacos Anytime,"Great Product for taco lovers. The design is nice with the ability to bake 4 tacos a time. The only draw back that I had hence the 4 stars instead of 5 is the non-stick coating. It has it's plus side with the easy clean-up, but the downside I had was the Tacos kept sliding off. I did find a solution for me by laying the taco on Al Foil with a 1/2 inch hem at both ends then hanging them over the peaks. It works for me because I wanted the taco shape without frying them (trying to control my cholesterol). Glad I bought it and would again."
2,Not Happy,"I bought this so that I wouldn't have to buy the stores Stale Fried, taco shells. But since most of the tortillas either break right down the middle and fall off of this baker, or the get REALLY HARD. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at this point."
2,Not worth buying,"Unless you make tacos every day this is not worth buying. It might be because I didn't know how, but I could never get all the shells to stay on the thing long enough to get it into the oven. I think I finally dampened the middle of the shell and kept them on. It's been a long time since I've used it, but I'm putting it in my garage sale whenever I get around to cleaning out the attic."
1,Worst ever product,I followed the instructions to the letter and could *not* get the tortillas to stay on the rack in order to bake them. I am returning this product as it is useless!
3,Not sure about his one,"My taco shells turned out tough. I'm going to try a couple of ideas for possible improvement, because I think the basic idea of this product is worth giving it a few more tries."
4,Nice rack!,This taco rack is good for forming your own tortilla shells or to use as a holder for loading your tacos up!
1,COMPLETELY UNUSABLE UNLESS....!!!,"We followed directions exactly (preheated corn tortillas in microwave with damp paper towels), but all the tortillas remained almost flat and unfoldable and when we tried to put them on the racks they just slided off!! We tried bending tortillas, but they only broke. We tried spraying tortillas with butter spray, but that made it worse.I was going to buy a steamer, but seemed expensive just for tortillas. Then I googled how to steam tortillas. Easiest method THAT WORKS is to put slightly damp paper towel on plate, add stack tortillas then put another damp towel on top. THEN put ANOTHER same size plate upside down over all. Microwave 45 sec to 1 min and NICE SOFT TORTILLAS that DO LAY OVER the racks. I haven't tried cooking them yet, but at least there is now a chance this may work."
3,Kept My Interest,"""You really had me fooled, didn't you?"" Andrea shrank away from him, appalled by the depths of his hatred. ""You've got to believe me!"" she cried passionately. ""I never cheated you!"" Less than a month ago, Stuart had loved Andrea with tenderness and passion, but now he had come to despise her and to regret ever having married her. How could she ever make him understand what he had seen her with Ronald? The task that lay before her seemed impossible, yet she had to try!Comment: The usual Big Misunderstanding, however, she was set up and certainly looked guilty. Hero was a big jerk of course; seems like he was cheated on before Remember this is an older book. What bothered me a bit was they married quickly without really knowing one another. She's in dire straits; he's a writer and needs a typist. Seems like she was much younger as well. Obviously it's been some time since I read the book, but plan to reread it again."
3,Solidly middle of the road but well-crafted,"Every detective fiction author has some unique ""conceit,"" or character and setting that have a trendy background. Although that is lamely predictable, it can be done well, and Yarbro has. Some silly political and social mantras aside, the writing peers into modern life with a skeptical flashlight, and the mystery is well-paced enough to unravel like a bungee jump - the jolt is at the end. Charles Moon is enigmatic as the solid character who steels himself against his own emotion, but there's a wrinkle: he's also a mystic. Here is where Yarbro triumphs: writing a mystical detective story that isn't complete garbage like some of the more popular ones. I'd recommend this to experienced readers of entertainment-level detective fiction."
2,Derivative hackwork,"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro (is that a she, a he, or a committee?) is an expert fad-surfer; although the vampire novels are reasonably adept, this attempt to cash in on the popularity of Tony Hillerman's Indian detectives falls flat. The writing isn't bad, and the mystery is intriguing enough -- but when Charlie S. (for Spotted) Moon uses magic to discover who done it, I found myself squealing ""That's CHEATING!!"" Don't bother to track this novel down; unless you're a collector of rare books, it's not worth the effort."
5,Great Stuff!,I absolutely love this book and audiobook!It's like going on a wonderful vacation - but you don't have to rush around trying to take in all the sites and then come back home tired. This 'vacation' is for the mind and soul. It is simply heaven!
5,One last visit with friends,I enjoyed my visit with Miss Read and all her friends. It was like going home again. I feel I also know all of the people. I wish that this was not the last book.This maybe the last book but you will find it is a new beginning for all of us.Get yourself a cup of tea and sit down and enjoy yourself with some old friends.
1,DISAPPOINTING TEXT AND PHOTOS,"I was very disappointed in this book. The author is just basically rehashing information from her previous book.This book is simply redundant. It does not do anything to help a photographer working with infrared acheive anything that he or she couldn't do by reading other and better infrared books out on the market today.The idea of visualizing a scene in infrared has been written about before, as has just about everything in this book. Save your money and look for other better books on the subject."
1,Huge disappointment,"I thought Laurie White's first book on infrared photography was a must for anyone interested in IR. This new effort does expand the scope of the first book, but fails to go into needed depth where it is crucial. For instance, exposure - it is barely covered and offers no constructive place to start for different lighting conditions. And what is the point of listing alternative developers if you don't include development times & temps. Too bad."
1,UNIMAGINITIVE AND UNINSPIRED,"This book is just not needed by anyone shooting infrared photos. Right from the start, the cover photo is a giveaway that the photos contained in the book are not creative in the least! Poor composition and no imagination used to shoot the images. If the author is explaining how to visualize how a scene will look in infrared, then why choose as poor a subject as penguins in the snow to shoot with infrared! The other useless information includes shooting infrared with a pinhole camera? How arcane is that? Also, there is a section on developing infrared sensitive eyes? Give me a break. Steer clear of this book. A waste of time and money."
3,Great Book But Not Much New Information,"The author has an excellent infrared photography book, however it is not much different from her first book which I also have. Either of these books are great, but there is not much need to own both."
4,A Solid Rolf Harris Collection,"To me, ""Tie Me Kangeroo Down Sport"" evokes memories of a jukebox in my favorite college bar. Though the version on this CD is not the one from the original 45 -- the derrogatory language directed at Aboroginies was replaced and a new verse substituted in -- it is still an excellend collection.This CD shows the versitility of Harris, his works ranging from folksy to humorous (the cover of ""Stairway to Heaven""). But a warning -- once you start listening to this CD, its hard to get some of the tunes out of your head."
4,A wonderful collection of some of his best work!,"I remember watching his t.v. show when i lived in England back in the 70's. My parents had a tape of his (that actually has some slightly different recordings of some of these songs) and we used to listen to it in our car on our road trips. Needless to say i know all the words to the classics. The only song that isn't on this one that i wish was is ""Fijian Girl"" That's a great tune. If anyone knows where i could find that old tape i'd appreciate it. The newer stuff is fine too, and stairway to heaven is a riot. the whole album makes me feel 10 again!"
3,good. want more.,"I was hoping to find a few other songs on his greatest hits like 'in the wet' , 'sir maximilian mouse','big black ball, etc.A good record all the same.I wish more people were turned on to this guys work-it would be easier to find. I love the led zeplin tune. Bryan S Whelan"
4,Ace!,"All the great Rolf songs I remember from my childhood, plus a bunch of standards. There are a few lachrymose tear-jerkers (Sonny, Sylvie, Two Little Teardrops) that I could do without, but many more that I love, especially: Tie Me Kangaroo Down; The Court of King Caractacus; Six White Boomers; and the borderline inappropriate Nick Teen and Al K Hall (which is a kids song, supposedly cautionary, about the joys of smoking cigarettes and drinking).My children (5 and 7) are lapping it up. And it's great to find a kids' CD that doesn't make me want to hide under my bed."
3,Some good songs,"We wanted some Aussie style songs to play at a BBQ. Most of the songs are more serious than I liked, but the few fun lighthearted songs were nice. We used only 9 of the 23 songs during the party, so I'm not sure if I would buy this particular album again.Good songs:Tie me kangaroo down sportCourt of King CaractacusIko IkoWaltzing MatildaWild Colonial BoyBotany BaySun Arise - Didjeridu style music, really niceWar Canoe - nice heavy beat, but serious lyrics - not really ""fun"" musicJake the pegTry a John Williamson album for more kid friendly Aussie style songs."
5,A page-turner!,"Aha! My exact word when I found Karen's book sitting on the shelf. I couldn't wait to get it home and start reading! Not surprisingly, I finished it in 5 hours of non-stop reading. This one was definitely a page turner! I couldn't stop!"
4,Exciting and Wonderful!,Unforgettable characters who are SO likeable--Loved the author's sense of humor. I chuckled throughout the book. Looking forward to Karen Ball's next book!
4,Present Company by Janis Ian,"Present Company by Janis Ian - Sixteen cuts on this CD from 1971. Prior to her hits of the mid 70's. Many young female singers should give early Janis Ian a listen and then study her 1993 and 1995 CDs. Starting out by her own admission as a ""Snotty Teenager"" Janis display here her talents of Writing and Performing. Her songs are well written and thoughtful, if not pertinent to her era. Now, go get and listen to her adult versions of her views and experiences. WOW! Breaking Silence and Revenge will impress you if you appreciate writing and performing talent of one of the foremost female singer songwriters of our time. Only a few write wonderful words and music, and then perform at this level. This music on Present Company is the beginnings of this Great Talent."
3,Cute bedding,"Got this bedding for my 8 year old daughter. She really likes it, but was really disappointed by the fact that the description said it came with a decorative pillow, but it didn't."
3,so-so,It may work better for other cats. It may just be that my cats are spoiled with the real stuff. They don't completely hate this spray but they aren't drawn to it the way they are with dried catnip. Worth a try in my opinion.
1,Choose another book for twins,"I was very disappointed in this book. I read this book while I was pregnant and expecting twins and found that instead of being a general guide for Moms expecting twins, it was one woman's narrative of her own experience being pregnant and having twins. She had a ""near perfect"" experience, full term twins and a natural childbirth. She does not even discuss prematurity at all! She doesn't discuss C-sections. She was never on bedrest, so she does not discuss that either. If she didn't experience it, it is not in the book. Sleep training? Not even mentioned once! My own experience carrying and giving birth to twins was so radically different than hers, that this book was 80% useless for me (and unfortunately I spent time reading the entire book!) I suggest Juggling Twins by Regan-Loomis as a more general and informative alternative. By the way - there aren't even any great tips in Twinspiration. Very disappointed and confused why it otherwise has good reviews."
2,Not very helpful,"I am newly pregnant with twins and checking out every book I can find on twins. For me, this one was a dud. As someone else mentioned, if this isn't your first child, there is really nothing new in it. It is more anecdotal then informational and I did not appreciate her sense of humor. It is obviously a matter of personal taste. Check it out from the library first to save yourself some money!I recommend the book Twins! by Connie Agnew, et al, if you are looking for detailed facts about twin pregnancy and birth. It is a few years old, but it goes into great detail about the different stages of pregnancy."
2,Good for a laugh,This book was good for a laugh and that's about it. It helped some when it came to traveling with twins but other than that it was more funny then helpful.
2,Starts off a little weak but gets better,"Revised review- 4 stars: It gets better after the first section! I was disappointed in the beginning of this book- I found it lacking in medical knowledge and patronizing. Much of the advice was very general and one-size fits all- with justifications like ""why risk it?"". For a good guide to your pregnancy, I would highly recommend ""When You're Expecting Twins, Triplets, or Quads, Revised Edition: Proven Guidelines for a Healthy Multiple Pregnancy"" which provides a lot of medically accurate information and is written in an engaging, mature style.I have revised my review because I did find the second half of the book quite helpful. The author is much better talking about the day to day work of raising, feeding, and coping with twins. I have enjoyed reading her advice and stories about her experience. I changed my rating from 2- 4 stars based on the second half of the book."
1,Skip this one,"I did not like this book at all. I hated the authors style of wrting, her personal views & found it very diffcult to read. Don't waste your time. Instead, try ""Twins!"" By: Connie Agnew, Alan Klein & Jill Ganon - it was a GREAT book if you are having twins!"
2,good if you have never been pregnant,"I guess this book has some pretty good info., but since this is my 2nd pregnancy (my 1st w/twins), it just wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for a book explaining the differences between singleton vs. twin pregnancy, prenatal twin diet info., bedrest if needed, how to handle 2 babies and a toddler simultaneously, etc.. I felt like I was just reading ""what to expect when you're expecting"" over again w/some different names and stories. This book was recommended to me from someone who has only been preggers one time,(w/twins, obviously!), so it was great for her. But not for me! So you may love this book, but don't get it if you already have been pregnant!"
3,"3 stars, wouldn't recommend to others...","I would summarize this book as a very long ""pep"" talk for parents who are getting ready for multiples. I probably wouldn't recommend this book to other parents.The book focuses on parenting from the ground up, not just the twin perspective. I was hoping for it to focus more on the differences of a twin pregnancy and parenting challenges. A lot of the advice was summed up as ""you will have to make the best decision for your family when you get there.""I felt that a lot of the advice had no research or knowledge to really back up the claims. The author then put a caveat ""this is just what I did, you do whatever you want."""
5,Great Advice,"This is an easy to read book that is dedicated to tips for twins. If you are expecting twins, this is a must have read."
3,"Good album, not great","While recomended, ""Ecstasy"" is not a good starting point for those seeking early Westbound era Ohio Players. This album has tremendous strong points, but overall it lacks consistency and focus. I like this album. You should buy this album. But ""Pain"" and the compilation entitled ""Orgasm"" should be considered first. If you are new to Westbound Records, The Ohio Players is going to have to wait- Funkadelic's ""Funkadelic"" is most definately THE best funk album of all time and a necessary introduction to The Ohio Players' ""Pain"", ""Pleasure"", and ""Ecstasy"" recordings."
3,"Beautiful, interesting and an original take on the sandbox game",ScraplandA brilliant little sci-fi sandbox game that falls short on populating the engaging world it has creating with enough things to do.
1,good game if you're 6,"I rented this game cause all the online game sites describe it as ""GTA with robots""It's more like GTA for little kids. The graphics were ok for like three minutes and then its not impressive anymore. The voice overs were rediculous, I mean its like watching some futuristic sesame street. The gameplay was just pointless. They tried being really imaginative but its just stupid in the end and has no redeeming value. ""Take one of my CRRRrrazy bets!! I'm the CRRRrrraZZZY gambler!""Give me a break."
3,A lost kid,"A lost kidShelley A. Barre wrote this book.The theme of this book is that Terry's mother finds this kid that has no place to go and is starving. Whenever terry's mother tells the family about Chive, Terry seems to be instantly suspicious about this. Then, over terry's protest, his mother brings Chive home to dinner. Terry thinks its some kind of racket, and he's not going to let his mother get conned.Yet before he knows it, he is giving him presents and teaching him how to skateboard. But he still knows nothing about him. It's no secret that Chive is poor, but what else is he hiding?Before Terry's mother finds Chive he is just a kid struggling to make it in the harsh world, getting food from anywhere he can. By the time he meets Terry's mom at the supermarket, he is a half starved street kid with no place to go."
4,Amazing and fresh songwriter,"T Randolph Scott is a breath of fresh air in todays trendy and politicaly correct music scene. His music is very easy to listen to as I have enjoyed listening to it from beginning to end several times. There are no boundaries for where he finds his inspiration, from serial killers to alien abduction. I trully enjoyed this entire CD and look forward to whatever this artist has coming in the future."
4,Great after a little installation trouble,"I bought this so I could pair a Bluetooth headset with it for use with Skype. I use XP Pro on my laptop. During installation the MS driver got installed instead of the Linksys one on the CD (not sure how - I *think* it's a bug but maybe I did something wrong). Nothing worked correctly, but the symptoms and error message gave NO clue. Finally a call to Linksys tech support identified the problem (took the senior tech support guy 45 minutes to figure it out) and I got the right driver installed. Once the adapter was working correctly there were still a few problem getting the headset working right, but that wasn't Linksys problem. Headset documnentation is still 100% oriented toward operation with bluetooth enabled handsets, so it took a little work. Now I'm a relatively happy campler - sound is acceptable but not great, the effective distance is 15-20 feet."
3,OLD TECH,"Would not work on my system, as this one is for OLD equipment, and 90% of most hardware,will have surpassed this piece easily by several years."
5,Stayed connected for hours,I purchased this used cheap. I paired it with a SENA Parani SD100 serial port bluetooth device in an industrial setting (connecting PLC's). I was very skeptical about the quality of the connection. I remained connected at 57.6k for over two hours with no problems. The only issue is the driver doesn't install well and there is a trick on the internet to get the driver to install properly. Well worth the money.
5,Not much to say about this,"Just plugged it into my Mac and off it went. Couldn't be easier! No drivers to install under OS X, just 100% plug and play."
1,Does not work. No help from tech support.,"After installing the software and adapter according to instructions, the adapter does not work. We called tech support, and after holding for more than 30 minutes, reached a representative who does not speak English. We then e-mailed tech support. The auto response promised a reply within 24 hours. This was two days ago."
3,Pros and Cons,"First the cons:1. Disconnects every now and then from my headset! There have been instances that it runs smooth and easy while chatting for almost four hours, but these are very rare! Can any one from Linksys address this? Why on earth is the functioning sporadic? I am yet to try this with multiple devices.2. ditto.Now the Pros:1. Smooth installation.2. Easy to use.3. Good range for communication.I am happy that I bought this from Amazon. I am impressed with the customer service. They have already shipped a replacement on 2nd day air. So will try my luck with the new one shortly and will update if required."
5,Easy Way To Synchronize Mobile Phone and PC,"After researching different websites on an inexpensive way to connect my Sony Ericsson T610 and PC via Bluetooth I ended up choosing this product over others...I made the right choice! While the software involved isn't the most user-friendly, it does the job relatively well. I was able to synchronize my phone contacts and notes from Outlook with my phone which took literally seconds to transfer. Like I mentioned before, the software (especially initial configuration), takes some time especially if this is your first experience with Bluetooth. But once it is setup, it is very easy to keep your phone's information up to date. I definitely recommend this product!"
5,Works for me!,I'm using Gentoo linux and this worked for me straight out of the box with the appropriate bluetooth kernel sources compiled in and the Bluez drivers up and running. It works great as a bluetooth receptor for me though I can't necessarily say the same thing about peripherals I use with it :'(
3,Second time was the charm,"Step 1: Got it, installed the software, plugged in... nothing happened.Step 2: Uninstalled, plugged in... nothing happened.Called tech support. The guy on the phone was polite and knowlegeable, but he led me through the step 2 three more times before agreeing, an hour later, that I must have indeed gotten a defective gadget.After that, it was almost a cakewalk. Amazon made no fuss about replacing the product and sent me a replacement a week later. That one worked the first time. I use it to Skype with my Jabra headset. It works fine all over the first story of my house, and even out in the backyard. The only trouble is that I keep forgetting to mail the defective one back. I can see why Amazon would require its return, and the shipping is free, but I'm about to be charged for it, which wouldn't have happened if it worked the first time."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!,"When I first bought this product it was great and worked well then after 2 weeks of use the antenna connected to the device breaks off and did not work. When I called Linksys about the problem they called it and I quote ""The device must have been put under unusual conditions."" They also refused to give my money back. Well in the trash it goes!"
2,"If you have SP2, this is not for you","This adapter will not work at all with Windows XP SP2 - despite any promises from the Linksys website, this cannot be setup - buy the Anycom adapter instead."
3,works fine but not what i expected,I bought this product coz as this says it is a class 1 device and it has a 100m range but when i actually tried using it from a distance it doesn't have a long range...other than that it works just fine!!!Anyways I swear by Linksys products as I have a good experience with them....!!!!
4,almost perfect,"after a long search i found out this blue tooth adaptor is the only one with this range, and its one of the few that come with the required software. after following the directions to install you must reboot and go to device manager and click on update driver, then browse the cd for the driver, this is the only way to make it work because windows wants to use its own drivers instead of the ones designed for the device., . .this solution took me 7 weeks to figure out, but now it works perfectly."
3,Wish I could give it more stars - but wish it would work too,"Now that I finally have it working, this is a cool little device. I use it to sync my Samsung i730 via Bluetooth and ActiveSync to Outlook on my PC. Installation was a nightmare. Tech support via phone (from India) was absolutely hopeless. They had no idea what was wrong and assured me the device would NEVER work with ActiveSync. After figuring out the install flaws by myself, I finally got all the pieces working as they should, including ActiveSync. However, after all is said and done, as long as the BT adapter is connected to my PC, it will not go into Standby (just ""wakes up"" again instantly). Pull the BT adapter and the PC behaves as normal. No resolution from Linksys (via email, won't even try phone support). So, the product is temptingly close to working...just fell a bit short of plug and play."
4,No problems,The adapter works well. I use it for gaming with a motorola headset & vent - no issues. Plug and play usb keeps everything simple.
1,Never worked,"After excellent review from friends I decided to purchase the adaptor. tried to install it on 5 different computers and kept getting the message that it was not a recognized device. Call Lynksis customer service, hours of waiting time, finally able to chat with someone and after some test recommended to return the item as it was broken"
3,"Nice Hardware, Annoying Software.","The adapter works great, I have great coverage over the entire condo (and back yard). My only complaint (pet peeve) is the software, which LinkSys has decided you will love so much that it puts a link both in the system tray and on the desktop, neither of which you can delete. Desktop cleanup involved a little RegEdit and a lot of cursing... I'll definately try another brand before buying any more Linksys products."
2,Not Pleased,Product was easy to connect. After two weeks it stopped working. I have a keyboard and number pad. Worked fine at first. Then it started loosing connection to the point where it will not connect at all.
1,Frustrating device,"I installed the device in two diffetrent PC's both with Windows xp sp2 and it didn't work. Then I found out that the xp sp2 installs its own Windows drivers, something that should be alerted to the consumers. After manually changed the drivers in my pc to the Linksys drivers, my Palm Zire 72 is working fine and smooth. If you want access to the Web and your Mail you will have to configure your PC to share internet connection through the network adapter that has the acsess to Internet. Someone must write a book on this issue."
2,Careful with the antenna,"The adapter works great, but the antenna is flimsy and broke in the first week that I had it."
1,"not worked with samsung t629 and windows vista, messed up my system!","I bought it to link a wireless laptop with a blue tooth cellphone to have internet connection to go. It didnt work and messed up with my computer. i had to do system recovery to get rid of the crappy errors after that USB installation software!!very nice and good customer service, they advised me to install and update such and so, it was not helpful at all. Thanks God my computer was warranted and Thanks to the Amazon , was return without headache! I bought a cable to do the job and get rid of the software incompatibilities!! I wish it was working, I wanted to be wireless!!"
3,Linksys USBBT100 Bluetooth USB Adapter,Worked good but did not have any further range than the previous one I had with the built in antenna. I would have kept my old one if I knew this.
2,Not fully supported by Mac OS X,"The Linksys USBBT100 does not support the headset protocol with Mac OS X. Otherwise it seems to work fine, but if you're planning on using a bluetooth headset for Skype or iChat AV, you're better off going with the D-LINK BT120 even though the D-Link has only a 10 meter range."
5,"Works great, but follow dash-o's advice with XP SP2.","Thanks to dash-o's excellent review and advice, I was able to install this device without a hitch. I seems to work as promised. I'm able to connect to my Verizon v710 and dial out with it. No more need for a USB cable. I can also use the laptop's microphone to voice-dial the phone, but I haven't figured out how to get the phone audio to play through the laptop speakers yet. Still, handy tool if you have a v710."
3,It's an OK television for the price.,"The picture on this tv is decent for the price, but there are a bunch of little nuances that make this tv more trouble than it's worth. The processor inside is very slow, and that makes everything take a long time: booting up, changing channels, switching between video inputs.. all very slow. The menu isn't set up very well, and the tv itself looks kinda bulky compared to others on the market.I got this tv cuz i'm a cheap bast'rd and couldn't bring myself to spend a grand on a decent tv. but i had to have a flat-panel, so i compromise by dealing with the annoying navigation.Also, in case you didn't read it anywhere else, you can't use universal remotes with this badboy because none of the codes are compatible with this device."
3,Just didn't draw me in,"This is a review of the free Kindle version.Oddly, as much as Caesar interests me, this version just didn't do it. I didn't think it was possible to read a book about one of the most important people in Western history, and to go ""meh"" once done. The author did a wonderful job of sucking the interest out of the story. I think my issue is the author's religion creeping in, but that isn't too surprising for a 19th century work.For free, sure get it, but I'm going to see if I can find another freebie that fits the bill better."
4,living in the right century,"an excellent example of the steve miller bands continuing effort to bring all genres of music to every new generation of listeners. My kids really enjoyed it also. Cant do much better than ""behind the barn"", or ""big boss man"". And the title track is very catchy. A great addition to your cd collection."
4,Slinky is NOT to be Missed!,"Well, the album in its entirety is just OK (maybe 3 of 5 stars), but one track on it, ""Slinky,"" is an instrumental ditty that should NOT be missed by guitar afficionados. Every time I've seen Mr. Miller live I've begged him (by screaming it whenever I could) to jam ""Slinky"" but he never has. Therefore, its one of my all-time life fantasies/goals to hear him (or actually anyone) play ""Slinky"" live (and for longer than the 2:40 track).If nothing else, buy this album to hear ""Slinky."" You won't regret it!"
5,Fluted Tortilla baking pans,These pans are a high quality product. They are made of thick metal with a non-stick coating. I have been able to feed my family healthier meals by baking ordinary tortilla shells instead of using the ones that are fried.
5,tortilla shell forms,Excellent product. Produces taco salad shells just like in Mex. resturants. Am ordering more so can serve more at same time.
5,make the best taco salad ever,"I purchased a set of these over ten years ago and use them often. When we have guests, I simply bake as many as I need ahead of time. When dinner time rolls around, I place them on plates, set out dishes of ingredients, and let everyone fill theirs the way they want. Now I am buying sets as gifts for others because of the rave reviews I received. A wonderful gift for anyone. If you do not like tacos, try filling them with some of your other favorite ingredients. Lemon pie, chocolate, etc."
5,Took a While to Receive (Back Order) But Worth Waiting For,"These tortilla pans were on back order and took several weeks to arrive, but they did arrive much sooner than Amazon's estimate.I tried them the other night with flour tortillas, and they worked great! Some reviewers have mentioned microwaving the tortillas for a few seconds so that they hold the mold shape better, but I didn't have to do that. I'm looking forward to trying other recipes using these pans! I only wish I'd gotten two more so that I could bake four at a time."
5,Great product,We use these very often. They make nice crispy salad bowls with no frying or grease. We use the fat-free tortillas and enjoy a healthy meal. They are very durable and clean up is quick. We have since bought some to give as gifts.
4,Works Great,I love them. Would refer them to a friend. Makes a wonderful gift for a person who likes to cook.
1,Horrible,"This book is not worth the paper it is printed on.There is a lot of the text that is corrupted, making the book worthless.There is also drawings inthe original(1885) book, none of which are in this re-print.Look for an original."
5,This is a bad a** movie,"If you like westerns, and you like tales from the crypt, this movie is for you. Three tales held together by a common character, and a corpse that won't stay down! this movie is the best!"
4,Read the fine print...,"Should have paid closer attention... Ever seen tires made of NYLON ?!? Mine certainly ARE!! They simply don't smell, look, feel or react quite like rubber tires.Still, they more or less function as planned for the little, light trailer which I put together.Note: the picture on the page of this review is NOT of the tires I received. Mine have actual 'knobby' treads, not these more industrial-looking ones."
1,Don't buy from Northern Tool,Supplier delivered the wrong product and has not responded to requests to return wrong item. I would not buy from this supplier on Amazon.com again.
5,Wheel for hand truck,Works great for a good price. Easy to install and is as good as the original equipment. Would buy again when needed.
3,"Home on the range. (Yes, I know it's corny)","Back Cover description: Cowboys were her weakness. Madeleine Harmon was finally going to visit the West. After years spent nursing her grandfather, she was going to live for herself-take sunrise breakfast rides, learn how to rope, have adventures and watch the desert stars. Only she got picked up by the wrong cowboy at the train station. Instead of vacationing on a dude ranch, she found herself taking care of Stuart Anderson's house and his daughter. Maddy was a sucker for a strong and silent man in denim and dusty boots, and she was an even bigger sucker for being needed. Stuart and his daughter obviously needed a woman. And how they needed her love. But hadn't she headed West for freedom?I agree with the reviewer from IL in that it could have been better, but for an easy, quick read it's OK. Nice bunch ofcharacters. Both Stuart and Maddy are likable, the daughter is not annoying and all ends well. Great book cover--is it a photo or painting?"
3,:|,"Madeleine needs a vacation after taking care of her grandfather until his recent death. She heads out west, but is picked up by the wrong person and goes home with Stuart who thinks he is picking up a housekeeper. After seeing how desperate Stuart and his daughter were Madeleine decides to give up her vacation and stay on at Stuarts instead of going to the dude ranch like she intended.Madeleine and Stuart develop feelings for one another, but neither wants to admit it.The book starts out great, but goes down hill from there. The middle of the book is about the things that they all do together. It is not until the last few pages that things start to wrap up and just like that its over. The story had a lot of potential, but fell short at the end."
1,Simply Garbage.,"Its hard to believe anyone would publish something like this. To all prospective buyers, save your money and purchase ANY other book than this one. One star is a generous rating."
1,Vague Information At Best,"I consider this a very poor addition to my collection of Discus books. I found it to be poorly written and devoid of any really useful or unique information. All information in this title was handled, much more thoroughly, by earlier publications from Jack Whattley and Bernd Degen. Save your money for one of the better written titles."
4,Nice book,A quality primer supplement for the formal study of Hindi. Gambhir shows a wonderful ability to convey the less formal aspects of speaking Hindi.
1,Not as Pictured,The stones in these earrings were so light in color they looked almost colorless. I never wore them because I couldn't get the post through my ear. I compared it to other earrings I have and the post was much thicker. I was very disappointed and returned them.
4,hallucinations,"Although it was a bit difficult do get into, once I did, it was non stop. I knew that it was somewhat based upon factual occurrences but the ""hallucination"" parts were a bit disconcerting. He talks of escape a number of times and these can vary between mental as well as physical escape. It was a bit mind-blowing when I finally finished and had time to process the entire story. Wow."
5,The Best Book by the Best Authority on State Legislatures,"Prof. Rosenthal's book is the best analysis of state legislative process. His book deals with all 50 but makes distinctions in process among the states. Nor does he make the mistake that they are all just ""little Congresses."" He has spent his life studying state legislatures close up, and his understanding shows. He is neither an apologist or a critic of state legislatures but, rather, a careful observer and presenter. His writing style makes the book easy to read while presenting valuable insights. You don't understand state legislatures until you have read this book."
4,A long wait between Albums but it was worth the wait,Always have been a chisel fan and to listen to the Last Wave of Summer was great.
5,Simple and Easy to Use,I don't use it much but I have used the tables in a training exercise and they were worth the price.
3,Shoes,I love the look of these shoes. The only problem that I could say is for everyone to buy a 1/2 size bigger then normal.
2,"Often inaccurate, some far-fetched, Not good for beginners or young kids","I took out 3 stars because: 1) Of more than 5000 characters in use, this genealogy only lays out perhaps 1000 pictographic explanations, most for traditional form of characters. The rest are simply and often incorrectly treated as pictophonetic characters (i.e., with one element indicating meaning and the other sound). 2) Many translations are close but inaccurate and some explanations are far-fetched. 3) Compared with other mnemonic tools, such as Hoenig's 2178 mnemonics or geniusChinese 5467 mnemonics, this one may be too technical for beginners or young learners.Two stars are given for its very good price (even free at its website) and excellent presentation of the genealogy.Although I only gave 2 stars, I still use it sometimes. The author did an excellent job at his time."
2,I would like it more if I were in prison,"This would be a terrific resource if it weren't the fact that you can get it all online, for free and much more conveniently through zhongwen.com. So yes, the dictionary is... helpful. But it is also online. Don't waste your money. Unless you are being sent to prison or can't get access to the internet for some other reason, I would not recommend buying this product."
3,Some critical remarks,The dictionary is indeed perhaps the best book available in English which attempts to present mutual relations between the Chinese characters.The sole problem is that it is based on the first character dictionary compiled in the beginning of our era when the bone script characters were already lost. Without knowledge of the bone script a genealogy (or morphology) of the Chinese characters can not be consistent as the character shapes have changed between 700--200 B.C. much more than ever after. So I would call Harbaugh's dictionary a traditional genealogy not a systematic (or argumented) genealogy.
4,"This book is actually good, but one caveat though...","This is a revision of my initial unfavorable review of the book. After realizing that a certain liberty was taken for the sake of ""orthographic economy,"" I have re-evaluated this book to be quite good for my Chinese education.My only caveat is how this book handled the vowel ü, which was very nicely explained by reviewer Zhou Hanqing. I recommend reading his review before trying to pronounce the ü and u vowels.Pronunciation is very important. :)"
3,i planned to use it as a dictionary,"but there are others that are better for that purposeTom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC(...)"
4,Useful in some respects,"I bought this book when I began studying the Chinese language and after I had become acquainted with the author's excellent website. Unfortunately, this book is mostly useful for students learning the traditional character set. It does include the simplified versions of characters; however, the layout and organization are heavily biased towards the traditional way of writing the characters. For those students who are learning the simplified way of writing characters (the set used by mainland China), I recommend the Concise English-Chinese Chinese-English Dictionary by Oxford University Press that can be found elsewhere on amazon."
5,Unique tool,"A unique tool for searching chinese characters for foreign language students. It's easy to read. The book includes all the possible ways of looking for words: by English entries, by Chinese sounds, by stroke counting, by stroke order. The body of the dictionary is designed to illustrate how Chinese characters are actually constructed starting from radicals."
5,Essential _learning_ tool,"This dictionary is of extreme help for me in learning Chinese. I always loved the etimological approach in language-learning, and this is even more true for Chinese.When encountering an unknown character, if you recognize any of the components (not only the radical), the search in this dictionary based on these components is easy and fun. I looked up one character, and found myself flipping through several pages for others. Great for getting used to characters: meaning+meaning, meaning+phonetic.Problem is that if you only know the simplified form and no pinyin or meaning, you'll have difficulty with this dictionary. The simplified forms are given, but you first need to find the traditional one... Sometimes the 'etimological' explanation may not be 100%correct (as other reviewers said).Altogether, still my most used dictionary when learning!!"
4,Very good book,"This book helps a lot learning mandarim, realy very good and better than any other dictionary, buy it. Buy 5 because it will dissolve if you use so much, its paperback and the pages have not so much good quality..Editors.. make an version in hardcover and good quality paper pls.Four starts just because the poor paper.Saludos,"
4,An Worthy Companion in studying Chinese,"Although the same material can be found online at zhongwen.com, this book is useful when you need to work with chinese away from a computer. The lookup system, requires a little more hops than most dictionaries; however, once you find the information, related words prove very useful in conveying the alternative usages and the connation of the word."
5,The easiest and the most informative dictionary available,"I found this dictionary incredibly helpful in my Chinese studies. It breaks down the character promoting the understanding of the root characters. In my study of Chinese, I found that I was able to decipher words that I have never seen before! What is also great is that one can use many different method to find a word. Thanks for a great dictionary! Keep up the great work!"
5,Great minimalist bag,"I don't take the whole desk with me when I go out and I wanted a bag that was unobtrusive and stylish. This is that bag! I've had it for 4 years now, still works and looks great. Fits my MBP perfectly and has just enough storage for a small HDD and power cord."
2,brochure not book,"At thirty-two pages and several pictures on each page, I wonder if it can really be called a book LOL. If you are a beginner like me, a book with more details would be much more helpful. I've been enjoying books by Alwyn Crawshaw and Elizabeth Horowitz. They take the time to explain supplies and basic brush strokes."
4,Great for beginners and advanced artists,Bought this just to brush up on skills so I could teach a class. There are helpful ideas in here but you have to have a little bit of a painting background to undrestand everything.
3,meeeee,"This book had a half price book sticker for 1.00. I paid 4.00. However, the work in this book all seemed to be from caribbean islands so I really didn't think it had relevant projects for me."
2,review update,"Being a first time user, I found it very practical and it worked ok (but totally ruined my Tshirt with brown spots!). It works fine but kind of gives me some itching in the area, which goes away after one or two days.I'd like the dye to stay a bit longer.Update: I developed an unbearable itching just when applying the dye, it doesn't go for two or three days. I stopped using the product as I ended out being allergic to it."
3,PEACE PENDANT,PEACE pendant is nice - a bit big but OK. Seems to be of reasonable quality. Works for the costume trying to create.
2,If you like a zillion closeups....,"Rent this movie. Don't pay the 9 or 10 dollars it's going to cost you to get in (unless you're old like me which would mean 'only' a 6 or 7 dollar admission). It'll keep you interested for about the first 45 minutes. After that I become distracted by the endless closeups (full-face, profile, eyes only, mouth only, top of head, hands) and pained expressions which substituted for meaningful dialogue. Frankly, my mind began to wander..wondering why Redford didn't stay out of the sun in his youth, why Dafoe's skin is beginning to look like linoleum, why there was only that one shot of the dog, why Helen Mirren would sign on for such tripe. I'm giving it 2 stars for the actor playing the detective. He was good. His assistant had one line. I'm always curious about such shenanigans."
1,The Clearing,"I saw this and thought it was so dull. It was boring and slow-moving; crinkling the movie's receipt was more fun. The only part that brought light into this movie was a grandchild's birthday, but that lasted a few seconds. Although I thought this movie was a snore, I wanted to see how it ended. To my surprise, it didn't end the way I wanted it to."
3,Quietly disturbing.,"The Clearing is a quietly disturbing thriller about a very violent topic--kidnapping. The main characters-Willem Defoe as the kidnapper and Robert Redford as the successful business magnate and victim--spend a lot of the film in conversation. We get a picture of how an intelligent charismatic businessman would try to persuade his captor to let him go. The businessman's wife, played by Helen Mirren, discovers unpleasant secrets about her husband during the FBI investigation. Ultimately she discovers the core of her love for her husband during this difficult time.The Clearing is edgy and suspenseful but has the hushed concentration of an art film. I enjoyed watching Redford and Defoe together. They both excel in quiet intensity which is what this film called for. The eloquence of Mirren's acting is a joy to behold. This strange movie is worth watching for the brilliant performances by three greats of the screen."
3,"Interesting character study, but only worth a rental...","Helen Mirren, Robert Redford, and Willem Dafoe all have better vehicles deserving of permanent space on your shelves. ""Clearing"" is an interesting character study of a kidnapper, a victim, and the kidnapped victim's family. This film depicts the crime from all angles, which is one of it's best aspects. The stretching of time for one storyline and collapsing for another is at best confusing and worst heartwrenching if you are involved with the characters. While both Dafoe and Redford gave an excellent performance, I believe that Helen Mirren as Redford's wife was the heart of this film and the heart of the family. Kudos to her for a standup performance."
2,Wasted talent,It was the great cast that gave me confidence that I would appreciate this film. No such luck. I was bored and unchallenged from beginning to end.
3,Boring With A Horrible Ending,"[Spoiler Alert]The Clearing is about a goodie goodie rich guy(Robert Redford) who's kidnapped by a depressed, down and out guy(Willem Dafoe). The wife(Helen Mirrin) of the rich a$$ must stay strong as possible. During the kidnapping, the rich guy and the poor guy talk to each other and discuss how much they have in common and how much they don't.This movie is boring, but most of it is interesting. Then there's the ending. The ending proves nothing except that there's no point to the whole film. Willem's character kills Redford's character and purposely gets caught. All the conversations, the crying, the depression, only to see the hero of sorts get killed. Redford should've known better. I'd expect Dafoe to pick a bad role(he played Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ), but he actually does good. The ending comes so quick that you never really figure out why Dafoe's doing this and why he waited all day to kill him.Was this review helpful to you?"
2,The Clearing,"A very confusing movie to watch. I had to watch the director's commentary after watching the movie to explain exactly what transpired. There are many obvious present moment and past moment movie scenes, but there is a twist that was not exciting, thrilling or even remotely entertaining. I did not watch this alone, the other two guys who watched this with me felt the same way. The script, concept and actors are wonderful. The direction and editing leaves the viewer confused and feeling like ""We will never get that time back again"". The DVD jacket describes this movie as an ""Intelligent Thriller"" by The LA Times. Maybe a little thrilling but absolutely not intelligent."
1,So many for sale - wonder why,"This was a disappointment, a real bore. Overall a surprise considering the talent involved. I waited for a twist, something exciting & entertaining, and you won't find it here unfortunately. Best of 2004? Not a chance."
1,"TALKY, PRETENTIOUS AND BORING","The poster showed a man's bound hands. We could see only part of a face, but it was clearly Robert Redford's. Audiences assumed THE CLEARING (Fox) was a suspenseful thriller about how Redford's character was going to get away and perhaps punish his kidnapper, a slightly unhinged but determined Willem Dafoe.Nothing could be further from the truth.This finely acted but dreary, affected, character driven melodrama gives it's ending away in the first act and all the rest is talk, talk, talk. And if that's not bad enough, the staggeringly pretentious commentaries from writer Justin Haythe and director Peter Brugge layers the sophomoric rhetoric into realms of suffocating self-aggrandizement rarely heard in a lifetime of ordinary conversation.Remember, time wasted on bad movies is gone forever."
1,Absolutely awful!!,"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robert Redford, Willen Dafoe and Helen Mirren walked through their parts. This movie is so boring that you are actually happy when its over and you get to leave. It's not even worth a rental price and I am sure that it will break the land speed record heading towards video. If its in the theatres another week I'll be surprised. Willen Dafoe kidnaps Robert Redford and takes him up a mountain to kill him. There is no reason given for the kipnapping and you have no empathy for Redford because his character is never really brought to life. As for his wife, played by Helen Mirren, she doesn't even shed a tear when her husband doesn't come home. She goes on with her life and hardly gives the FBI agents the time of day. PLEASE don't waste your money."
2,THE CLEARING is Disappointing,"Upon finishing this film, I could hear Peggy Lee singing, ""Is That All There Is?"" 95 minutes of a kidnapping (Redford's) and the resulting FBI and family drama associated with it (kind of standard TV stuff)and an ending that, while somewhat surprising, left me cold because I simply didn't care about these people. I'll give you the fact that Willem Dafoe plays creepy guys better than just about anybody, but even he didn't inspire much terror or pity in this one. Helen Mirren (always interesting to watch) and Robert Redford go through the paces as the rich married couple at the heart of the story, but the whole thing just seemed a big waste of time. Several reviewers have gone out of their way to try to put a good spin on this film, talking about the emotional revelations and layers revealed as the plot moves forward, but I still didn't come away with anything except regret that I wasted 95 minutes and a few bucks at the rental store."
2,Not One of Redford's Best,"It seemed like it would be a good movie. Redford, as always, was great, and the supporting cast were very good too, though I think Willem Dafoe was a villain without a character. And that is the real problem, the script. All they did was march Redford through the woods while the families had soft and painful moments in their luxurious McMansion. There were, basically, only three characters, with a few family members added at the end. The end left plot details unclear to me. It was billed as a struggle between good and evil, fate and luck. I thought it would never end."
3,a good renter not foer keeps,i saw the clearing it was okay movie with good story if you like robert redfordthis movie is for youit is good movie to rent for aboring weekend
2,A Depressing Movie,I am a big fan of Robert Redford but this is the worse movie that I have seen him make. The plot of the movie was quite confusing and never really gave answers to several questions. Such as why was he kidnapped? The ending was also disappointing. I'd like to see him make another movie with a happy ending. I came out of the theatre depressed.
3,The Clearing,"This was a masterful job of acting by the three main characters, Mr. Redford, Mr. Dafoe and Ms. Mirren and is worth watching just for that reason. It has a masterfully intertwined plot that leaves the audience gasping. But after all of that, I know I could have come up with at least a thousand ways for this tale to end other than the way it did."
1,This has to be one of the dullest and least interesting movies,This has to be one of the dullest and least interesting movies I've ever watched. I feel like I wasted my time.There was no point to this movie. The lines are poorly written. Anyone could have written this dreaful story.
2,Where is WebSphere performance in this book?,"I found this book promising but extremely disappointing. Websphere has a lot of tools available for performance monitoring, but this books only mentions the most obvious of these in the last 14 pages. This is typical of the book, where it tends to address how to tune hardware and Windows / UNIX, but not WebSphere or even the JVM.For an excellent introduction to WebSphere Prrformance see: Barcia, Roland et al. IBM WebSphere: Deployment and Advanced Configuration. Prentice Hall PTR. ISBN: 0131468626.For performance and scalability, see: Roehm, Birgit et al.

5,LOOKS GRATE,IM A FRIST TIME AUTHOR AND WANT TO SELL MY WORLK. IS THIS BOOK FOR ME.? THANK YOU JANETPOE@AOL.COM
4,Makes learning Japanese great fun!,"Interactive Japanese 1 makes learning Japanese fairly easy considering the difficulties this language presents to the beginner. Despite its title, Interactive Japanese 1 is excellent for studying the language on your own (as I am doing). It definitely makes you learn the hiragana and a couple of kanjis as you go along but misses out on the katakana. However, it is a little slow in its progress in discussing grammatical issues. Now, I am waiting for volume 2!"
3,"Interesting, but certainly not to die for","I expected better. A very thin book with very little space devoted to actual suicide notes. The introduction was written by someone who doesn't really seem to understand the suicidal mindset. There were a couple pretty interesting chapters, such as the golden gate bridge jumpers, but I'm glad I interlibrary loaned the book rather than buying it. Many of the notes are very old, like 1900-1920. One intresting quote which I will paraphrase here says that mentally healthy comfortable people don't want to write and that to want to write is a sign of mental problems. It really says something about me. I get excited just seeing a fresh notebook."
2,THIS WAS MY IDEA>>YEARS AGO.,"I must have gotten drunk and let the cat out of the bag at some point. It is, of course, conceivable that somebody could have had the same idea but I feel as if I've been slighted. Maybe I'll do it the *right* way."
3,Interesting,"The suicide notes themselves as well as the similarities between them were quite interesting. The author's comments about the the narrow vision experienced by the suicicidal, while perhaps being psychologically accurate showed a complete lack of understandign of the emotional experiences of the depressed. His tone implied that he felt those who committed suicide were not intelligent enough to see any other way out of their situations. The author himself doesn't seem to have any idea about what it is like to feel so completely lost and desperate. The commentary was also rather repetitive and didn't seem to offer much insight other than the fact that suicidal people see no other way to end their suffering."
3,Sadly Interesting,"I read this book purely out of careful curiosity and was therefore mildly offended by Mark Etkind's initial comment about the reader...""you are a sadistic voyeur"". I thought that was very inappropriate.The content itself is definitely lacking and could have benefited from less commentary. I reached the end pages all too quickly, although not from enthusiasm. There is a good variety of notes included but simply not enough to allow one to become totally immersed. I found some of the notes to be incredibly sad and I felt they reinforced just how vain suicide can be.This book gives you the choice to utter a callous chuckle as you flip the pages or to attempt empathising with those poor souls. Despite being brief and a rather sad read, it was interesting and quite useful in providing a glimpse into the mind and motive of a suicide. Valuable reference material."
4,Amazing Voice-Great Politcal Folk,"Venezualian Soledad Bravo uses her amazing voice to express political views in 21 songs, composed by such great artists as Violetta Parra, Daniel Viglietti, Rolando Alarcon, Silvio Rodriguez, and Atahualpa Yupanqui. Some of these songs have been recorded by other artists like Angel Parra, but the different versions serve as foils to each other, each different, each great. Perhaps singing about Che or Miguel Rodriguez is not timely today, but the messages are still thought provoking. These people lived and died for what they believed, not like the poor singer(s) referred to in Pobre del Cantor, and regardless of personal political views, their sacrifice must be admired. WONDERFUL CD, I recommend it for any fans of Canciones Nuevas and the popular folk movement of the 1960s and 70s."
4,Pretty good,"This headset is really nice looking, and also performs the basic functions that any headset should perform. It has decent sound for when you want to listen to the MP3 files you uploaded, and is also great if you don't feel like picking up the phone everytime somebody calls. The D&G logo and shiny golden design make it even more sleek than usual, and it grabs the attention of everyone around you. I highly suggest this to anybody who has the matching Razr!"
3,Run-of-the-mill thriller,"Down-to-earth thriller without frills but with solid grounding in reality. Good acting by Rachel Hunter, whose 'street look' is exactly what you would expect from the detective character she plays. The film moves along at a fair pace, but the lack of an exciting storyline weighs heavily on the action. In the end, little more than a time filler.Rated R for violence, language and brief nudity."
5,Outstanding,"Comprehensive, thorough, and fun. The use of humor takes the drab and boring out of the ususal DVD faire and make it entertaining for staff. Can be customized to your facility, or use as is...............thoroughly enjoyable and informative."
1,Bloodborne Pathogens-annual update for healthcare,This DVD is silly and dated. Wish I could have reviewed it before purchase. The search continues for me. Would not recommend this for staff training.
5,Postmodern Military,Definitely interesting book. In this book Moskos outlines his paradigm for the postmodern military along the lines of 5 organizational changes and a number of emerging trends for the military. The book is written from a sociological perspective and examines the emergence of these postmodern trends in different militaries around the world. This is definitely an insightful and fascinating book and so is its examination of other nations. Definitely a read for military sociologists and officers alike.
2,Repackaged psychoanalysis,"The basic idea of this book is that problems in marital relationships are caused by childhood psychological wounds. Those wounds are unconscious, but, according to the author, we all had them. Many of the exercises (e.g., listening exercises) would be helpful, but they are basic, and many of them are not really based on the theory. The author says repeatedly that we were ""whole"" humans in the womb, but we were damaged as children, and we need a healthy marriage to make us whole again. Some of the examples in the book reveal a patriarchal mindset. For example, in the section about ""rewriting scripts"" for arguments that a couple has repeatedly, the author suggests two alternatives that give the man what he wants, but no options for giving the woman what she wants. But if I object to that, I suppose that it must be because I was wounded as a child!"
3,What you lacked in childhood effects who you are now,"What you lacked in childhood effects who you are now - that is what this book is based on. Some people hate that theory. I was indifferent about it.It did have some valid points - but it was no life changing lesson in my opinion. However, we are seperated, so maybe our mind-sets are different."
5,BEST Relationship Book I've Ever Read!!,"I sat down with this book, and four hours later, I had made it through the first section -- with a pen and a highligher. Could NOT put it down. This is the most impacting book that I've ever read on relationships, and I've read a lot.... This is a must-read for anyone interested in succeeding (and ready to work) in a relationship. Very easy to read -- not clinical mumbo-jumbo -- and it's so practical. I read about 'myself' all through that book. Material is instantly applicable, and very eye-opening as to WHY we choose WHO we choose as partners. Explanations and examples are extensive and detailed to help the reader clearly understand the concepts. This has been extremely helpful as I'm going through a divorce. This book may even SAVE your marriage...."
2,Water damage and marks,"the book is very good, but the condition, which the seller said was very good, even excellent, was poor.There was water damage and many personal marks in ink and color markers all over the text.The rating by the seller was misguiding and a lie."
4,great book.,a great learning tool. I read it cover to cover and I think it will help me now and in the future.
4,Getting the Love You Want,"This book really helps you focus on your relationship with your spouse. It helps you to dig deep into the thoughts and reasons behind your behavior that probably never entered your mind. When you understand why you act a certain way in response to a situation, it can only serve to make your relationship stronger."
5,Getting the Love you Want,Getting the Love You Want allowed me to grow in my relationship with my exhusband and with human relationship in general. I constantly buy more copies hopping that family and friends will enrich themselves with this view of relating with others we care for and love. Lourdes Ferragut
3,Freud revisited,"There are some worthwhile observations in this book, but often it rehashes the old line about how you are the sum result of specific, defined experiences you had as a child. This type of generalization simply does not apply to many cases."
2,Getting The Love You Want,"This was an interesting book that focused on the theory and practice of two people involved in a relationship learning how to be become passionate friends.The book is divided into three parts. Part one focuses on attraction, romantic love and the power struggle. Part two focuses on a marriage that is satisfying and part three focuses on teaching you how to deal with the obstacles presented in part one and two.Part three presents a series of step-by-step exercises that you can complete in the privacy of your own home. These exercises claim to not only help you gain insight into the problems but also to help you resolve them.Does it work? Well, that is a question you will have to find out for yourself.This is an interesting book overall and you will definitely gain insight into your partner if you follow through with the exercises presented in this book. You may even surprise yourself and gain some insight into yourself."
2,Simplistic and repetitive,"Mr. Hendrix makes a few interesting points and gives a fresh spin on why we marry but he relies totally and incorrectly on one theory instead of the range of reasons that make marriage complex and wonderful just like life. Also, Mr. hendrix needs to write a book about the death of his parents so we , the reader, aren't forced to hear whinings of a totally different topic. This book may help people but only a very small number in my opinion."
5,best book ever,"Finally some one gets the whole picture! And puts it all in an easy to read book. Harville Hendrix not only explains the hows and whys of dying relationships he also has the cure. Most others only scratch the surface, he goes deep down. It can only be helpful to read it.I want my daughters to read this book before they begin a marriage!"
1,Why do the remixes have to be so elusive?,"At least a half-a-dozen big club remixes were done for Night of My Life, including mixes by Junior Vasquez and LEX, and all we get is one mix on a 10 dollar import.The US record label should have the smarts to release a domestic maxi so they'd actually MAKE some money after paying all these remixers, rather than having fans and music collectors download them for free...after which they file lawsuits against us for stealing music they never even released."
4,"""Come Tomorrow"" a Throw Back to By-Gone Yesterday","This time round this pleasure inducing couple has gone retro. ""Come Tomorrow,"" the second single release from Streisand/Gibb's ""Guilty Pleasures,"" is a throwback into the sixties complete with ""doo woop"" and a Motown pop feel. Though not the best track off their CD, ""Come Tomorrow"" tells a moving tale of two lovers trading lines of joy on the eve of their wedding. As always, Streisand's golden voice is a highlight, although Gibb sounds shakey with age getting a better hold of him. Also, as added heft is the inclusion of the Love to Infinity Mix of the rather mundane dance track ""Night of My Life,"" of which the original version can also be found on ""Guilty Pleasures."""
2,Ordered 2 bottle and only received one bottle of NingXia Red,The actual product is great for detoxing and increasing your energy level. I orderd 2 bottles and only received one that is why I am only giving 2 stars. Not sure for the price if this is comparable to Acaiberry juice or other antioxidants with high orac value.
1,MY Negative feedback was erased by Amazon or someone from this company,"I few weeks ago I made some negative remarks about this company's product based on an experience I've had with it. This product caused me to have a case of Diarrhea and based on that and the fact that no specific instructions is given on the limitations for how much you should drink in a given day. I left negative feedback and come to find out someone, somehow obtained my account information, logged in and erased my negative feedback I gave this company. This company like most companies don't allow dissent towards it's products."
5,The Cost is ridiculous....,"I am willing to buy this book $25 used, $35 new...that's it. If you want to sell your copy of this book to me for that price, just reply back to this review."
4,Executive 3-button poplin suit,"This is a grand looking suit. It fits well, and looks good on me. I have received numerous compliments on it. This suit is a tradition in the south."
2,Voices of the Loon,"As someone who spends summers in British Columbia and who has fallen in love with the loons on the lake there, this is a precious cd. There is no addition of music, thankfully, so loons are foregrounded; this is pure loon call. The most helpful part of this cd is the narration, which instructs the listener in what various calls mean. Now when we know when they are feeling threatened, when they're mating, and the nuances of their communication. And it is hauntingly lovely to hear their calls again; this recording will tide us over through the winter until we can return to the north and its loons."
1,Poor Quality!!,"I was excited about my new dual purpose baking pan. It makes great banana bread and I just used the other half for a meatloaf this week. The pan was in the sink overnight, not soaking, just residing. I was in the process of hand washing it just now and all the non stick starts to peel off the lowfat piece. I was so sick I immediately booted up the computer to come on here and prevent another from investing in this particular product. Save your money and try to find same concept by different manufacturer."
2,Disappointed Dieter,"I was so excited when I first tried my new 2 piece loaf pan and found it to make moist less fatty meatloaf. After using it 3 to 4 times and promptly washing/drying it each time; I put it away for a month or so. It rusted slightly in the corners of the pan and then when I used it anyway, the coating bubbled and peeled off while I was cooking at 325 degrees. What a disappointment for a great idea to be ruined by a poor coating! I suggest you seek this pan from a different manufacturer!"
1,Peeling Coating,"I had the same problem with this pan as others, the coating started peeling after only a couple of uses. I threw the thing out."
5,Finally meatloaf that isn't greasy,I have always enjoyed meatloaf but not the greasy feeling you get after eating meat thats been cooking in its own fat. I bought this pan a couple years ago and absolutely love it. We eat meatloaf all the time now and its never fatty or greasy. Just tonight I made some and drained the fat from the bottom pan into a clear glass jar. There was close to two inches of fat in the jar (disgusting). I highly reccommend this pan it works great and has help up wellover time.
2,Peeling Teflon,I loved the pan. Great concept. Used it three times and the teflon started to peel off in sheets. I'm afraid to use it now. Guess I will throw it out like the other users. No idea how to get a replacement without the paperwork.
2,Loaf Pan,"Used as intended this device works well to produce inedible meat loaves that taste like cardboard. Used without the upper pan it is a decent, but not terribly durable, product."
2,2-Piece Meatloaf Pan Set,"I bought this set of 2 pans inorder to eliminate as much fat as possible from my meatloaves. I have used this set about 4 times. After the last time I used it, it showed rust. Now I want to throw it out and replace it. I may use a glass pan with a rust-proof metal grating on the bottom. I might buy a George Forman hamburger maker that drains fat."
4,Not as bad as all the reviewers' venom would have you believe,"This book intends to be funny and sarcastic, which it is. True, as another reviewer mentioned, it offers little by way of suggestions as to how to combat empty language (for that, see The Evasion English Dictionary by Maggie Balistreri), but the author's purpose is met and she does a fine job. The tone is an amped-up NPR commentary, maybe an underground radio rant. Perhaps some of the negative reviews here have to do with the subtitle's curse word. People, if you're scandalized by cussin', judge this book by its cover and leave it be."
3,good book,"a good, easy read on the subject of corruption, greed and exploitation. if you're new to the subject, this is a worthwhile investment. but if you are aware of how we are being exploited by corporations and government, the book offers nothing new. different singers, same song. there can always be books written on the injustices of political/corporate greed and power. ms. penny does acknowledge she has no solutions to the problems. maybe at this stage of the game, there isn't. i hate to be cynical, but i don't see anything that will bring balance to a culture and society so out of balance. i recommend the book if you're not familiar with the topics, otherwise, skip it because you've heard it all before."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I picked up this book with great anticipation, but was slightly let down by its reiteration of ready-known facts. Like most authors from the left, Penny takes aim at the usual suspects, namely big business and - of course - the Bush administration. Though the book is very well written and thick with wit and sarcasm (sometimes TOO much sarcasm), it preaches to the choir much like other books of its nature (in fairness, Penny concedes as much). What I found especially eye-rolling is that in her attempt to expose the right for its exaggerated and deceptive (re: bulls**t) wordsmithing, she anchors her arguments by cherry picking facts and examples that are equally exaggerated. Overall, an enjoyable read, but if you've read these kinds of books before, don't expect to learn a great deal you didn't already know."
3,Could use a more accurate title...,"Highs: Witty, funny at times. Effectively hits it's many targets. Well-researched and documented.Lows: Typical GEN-X slacker English and distracting overuse of slang. Predictable left wing bias.Verdict: Could have gotten five stars with a more balanced skewering. Should sell well among the lefty/socialist set."
3,Your Call Is Important to Us: The Truth About Bullshit,"Some well stated trruths however, don't look for any cures. A fun read."
1,Worst book of the decade,"...and there's a lot of competition! Ill-informed, whining, poorly-written, poorly edited (if at all), politically biased. I'd call it sophomoric, but that would insult sophomores. Utterly lacking in wisdom, taste, discretion or readable prose. How this misshapen thing every found a publisher is a mystery. I want my money back!!"
4,Good Collection with Two Excellent Praise Songs,"This is an album full of solid, Scripturally based lyrics and rock music.There are several good songs on this CD with two that are superb. 'King' is a catchy tune that is very well done. The version of 'Blessed Be Your Name' done here is fantastic. It has lots of guitar, lots of rocking, and lots of praise to the Creator of the Universe.If these two songs were the only ones on the album, it would be well worth the price. As a bonus, it contains several other enjoyable songs.If you like praise music with lots of passion, this CD would be a good addition to your collection."
3,This music is good but is this what Christian music has.....,".....steeped to? I mean, people, if Bono from U2 wasn't a semi-decent guy with moderate views on the faith, he might just file a lawsuit. Tree 63, on both of their cds, has made in no secret that they basically copy and paste on many of U2's songs. Case in point: Blessed Be the Name. If you haven't heard U2's 'Where the Street's Have No Name', from their Joshua Tree cd, give it a listen and then come back and play BBTN by Tree 63. The background music is almost a direct spin-off. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but to act like their isn't a direct World to Christian music influence is laughable.This isn't the first time, either. Delirious has used U2 as an influence. Some of you will probably hate this review but I'm not out to earn brownie points but rather, tell it how it is. Like it or lump it, Tree 63 is not original.But their music is still good."
3,A little power and a lot of emotional beauty.,"This is the album from the hit currently getting play time on the radio BLESSED BE THE NAME. A lot of people and groups have done this song but TREE63 has an excellent version. From South Africa, this band has been knocking around since the mid-90's. This album is a credit to their faith and their determination.Some say their music is influenced by U2. I also think that if one listened to SONIC FLOOD SONIC PRAISE you might hear some stylistic sameness especially with their emotionally beautiful songs in the second have of the album. They have intro'd for SF. They have also intro'd for the NEWSBOYS and REBECCA ST JAMES.You can listen to their whole album on their website and I think you will conclude that they have the talent to make good rock music and great worship music where the sounds just carry you away wrapped in its calm and beauty."
3,Not as good as the last one......,"Symphony X simply put, blew me away with Divine Wings of Tragedy. This CD still has that kind of sound but the songwriting just doesn't grab me like their previous release. I hate to be critical of a band with so much talent, but this one never really gets off the ground so to speak. If you're trying out Symphony X for the first time, I'd definitely recommend starting with Divine Wings."
5,Good Prog,"I have most of the CDs of this band, but I would say that this one is by far their most superior with the track ""The Church Of The Machine"" a standout for me.For Prog to hold a listener's interest ( with its tendency to long songs ), tracks have to be tuneful and melodic. For me this is by far the most melodic CD from Symphony X. 'V - The Mythology Suite' ( their last CD ), being the one that suffers most from meandering twiddly-ness and lack of tunes.But check out this CD ( 'Twilight In Olympus' ), I am sure you will find something to like and sing along to."
4,Good but not their best.,"Title says it all. I like the album overall, but clearly the band was just coming into their prime. Smoke and Mirrors is my favorite song from this one. As you'd expect there's plenty of killer guitar riffs and solos.I'm not going to go into attempts to sell potential new fans on Symphony X. Its your loss if you dont check them out."
1,dream theater wannabe's,"Dream theater is a hard act to follow and Syphony X is doing their best.Musianship is more than great,but feeling is not coming to them as naturally as it does to DT.We all loved Malmsteen when he burst onto the scene with FBTS,but not much has changed since then,other than vocalists.Symphony X is heading in the same direction if they don,t broaden into more atmospheric horizons.Listen to some Pink Floyd guys for christ,s sake."
1,This review pertains strictly to the re-release.,"This review pertains strictly to the re-release. These new re-releases of the Symphony X disography is a terrible concept. Inside Out records has packaged the music to where there are no individual tracks. Merely one large one. It's a bummer because you can't rip them onto your computer so that you may place any of the individual songs on a ""best of"" type CD for you car or Diskman.Go with the regular release."
5,Fantastic album!!,Symphony X is starting to show more of their unique style on this album -they are truly an amazing band with great musicianship-and more importantly-great songs. All Dream Theater and Rush fans should give his band a listen. But-this band is different-not a copy of anyone. They are best best band to come along in very many years-you will not regret giving them a try!
3,"First Graders at The Potomac School in McLean, VA","In our Lower School Library, six- and seven-year-olds enjoyed this ""Ready-to-Read"" title introducing the unlikely friendship between a pig and a wolf. Although some found the like-sounding character names a bit confusing (Fitch and Chip), most first graders were quickly engaged in the storytelling built upon the pig's silly questions and the wolf's sensible answers. Students were divided on the proper audience for this beginning chapter book; half thought it best as a read-aloud to kindergartners, and half suggested first graders read it themselves. All agreed that the watercolor-and-ink illustrations suited the whimsical text and appreciated the changing format --close-ups, birds-eye-views and double-page spreads. Our young reviewers are anxiously awaiting more adventures of this preposterous pair!"
2,Spicy but not much chocolate flavor,I love this brand of teas but this version is more of a spice tea than a sweet tea. Not my cup of tea! But if you like spicy teas then this is for you.
2,Where's the Chocolate?,Nice spicy tea -- but I wanted a chocolate caramel tea! Can't taste any chocolate and the bit of caramel flavor is drowned out by the strong spiciness. I won't buy this flavor again.
2,Teach yourself Yoruba with a headache,"Being a European woman living with a Yoruba man, I wanted to learn some of his language and bought Teach Yourself Yoruba. Unfortunately, I found that this booklet makes things extremely complicated. Although it is precise and correct, it starts with the first 6 chapters only dealing with the different tones. The examples that are given are probably useful when learning tones, but desastrous when you want to build some kind of vocabulary or practise making sentences. You have to be quite persistent to make it to chapter 7 ('Greetings' - e.g. good morning, good afternoon), let alone chapter 20 ('Numerals' - e.g. one, two, three, four, five).I've learned many languages in my life (6 European languages, Chinese, Japanese, Swahili, Tibetan etc.), and although in most of them I never gained any fluency, I know from experience that this is not a good way to learn a language."
3,Caught up by the Knitting Bug!,"I bought this book because it was getting such rave reviews.The book is portable and has a nice cover picture, the cover is hard with an elastic strap to hold it closed so it won't get bent up when thrown into your bag.I was disappointed that it didn't have pages to keep track of completed knitting projects. There is a calendar and graph paper and a page to keep track of needle inventory.I already own the Knitters Companion that contains everything in this book and more so The Knit; Personal Handbook is just excess baggage."
5,My secret guilty pleasure,"Although I typically prefer my music to come for the 60's and 70's, I have to say that Hootie and the Blowfish are my secret guilty pleasure. I just love this band. Love the songs, the members, the voices - just the whole package. I also prefer Live recordings versus studio recordings. I have everything I love in this CD. Thanks guys for a great show!"
2,It's not the complete show,We ordered this believing it was the Rock N Roll Show as seen on PBS.The songs that are on it are the same as on PBS but there are at least a dozen songs missing from this tape that were on the original PBS show. Not happy about that. Would not have ordered it had we known it was incomplete.
1,Not even worth rating for use in US industry,Might be great if it were actually translated into American standards
2,Too confusing for 4 years olds!,"I had always heard great things about Reader Rabbit software but I was very disappointed in this one! My four year old got frustrated after 5 minutes and gave up. She found the instructions to be too difficult to understand because they were very detailed and spoken too quickly. The premise is that you're supposed to gather items for a surprise party. You need to obtain a specific amount of each item and it goes into an empty room once you gather enough for the party. You need to go to different areas to make cookies, wrapping paper etc. I don't know how a four year old could do this without adult supervision. This software will sit on the shelf until my daughter gets older. Hopefully then she'll enjoy it."
4,A nice change from domestic US drivel,"I was first exposed to Rogue Traders with their song Voodoo Child, featured in the episode of Doctor Who ""The Sound of Drums"", originally aired in the UK on 6-23-2007. As a long time fan of electronic rock, it was a pleasant surprise to hear a band of this style. If you were a big fan of euro-alternative in the 90s, I highly recommend this album."
4,Why no American release?,"I am simply astonished this music is not released in America. This is a great pop/rock album with loads of hooks and catchy songs. I discovered the band by accident and shelled out extra for the import. Anytime I'm playing it, people ask me who the band is. When I tell them, they always say they'll run out and buy a copy.BUT THEY CAN'T. At least not easily here in the States. They're new album is out and, as I understand it, doing very well elsewhere. What's it gonna take to get a USA release?"
4,Unique sound- This band will make you dance!!!!!!,"After hearing the first single 'Voodoo Child' i had to get this album and it is amazing!.Totally kitch but in a good way, If this wont get u dancing nothing will!Natalie has a unique voice and the stomping beats set it off perfectly. Instantly catchy infectious electro pop at its very best. BUY IT!!!"
2,Just kind of boring,"There's nothing on this album that stands out--there's a lot by Heart that I love, but this album feels lifeless and listless, and it's not one that I would choose to listen to over many other albums. ""Little Queen"" is much more satisfying, and of course, ""Dreamboat Annie"" is always listenable. This one, though, will stay on my computer, but only just in case I meet someone who wants to hear it."
4,What is serial number for original version,"I have the 2nd version of Magazine, and have loved it since it originally was issued. I'd like to find the original LP version to hear the different song versions. If any owners of original Magazine LP's read this, could you post the catalog number from the original issue? Thanks!"
3,Could Have Been Better,"I was anticipating the release of Heart's next work following on the heels of Dreamboat Annie and I saw this at the record store. I later learned that it was a release that the band did not recognize as legitimate because of a dispute between them and their label. I must admit while the music starts off good, it soon lapses into just filler by the label to put out a product. Still though had the band fullfilled their obligations and completed this, it would have been a great thing nevertheless. Despite the short commings and limited work, it is still a good CD and worthwhile to add to Heart's great music."
4,The Mushroom version was better.,"I have to wonder why Heart even bothered to make their ""own"" version of Magazine. I found a copy of the original Mushroom version in (what was then West) Germany in 1980 (and I found it strange they didn't wrap their LPs in cellophane, like in the US), and later found the ""official"" version released by Heart.I always got the impression that the changes made for the ""official"" version were made simply for the sake of change. This version is OK, but the (for lack of a better word) magic was gone. Heart would continue to put out good albums afterwards, and really should have let this one go."
2,Mostly Filler,"There is one fine song on this collection, ""Heartless"", and it can be found on best of collections that are a much better choice for all but the most devoted fans. Aside from that, only a couple of songs are worth hearing. The title track, ""Magazine"", is adequate, and their cover of Badfinger's ""Without You"" (Nilsson made it a hit) sounds like a demo but holds some appeal. The rest is completely disposable. This package was thrown together by the record company from various scraps following a dispute with the band. My advise is pass it by."
5,I just like Heart,I just like Heart. Not everything they do but most of it. I enjoy this collection a couple times a year when I get in the mood for Heart. Recommended.
3,live versions are edited and studio tracks not original mixes,"Great album, but when you hear the original release this one is a whole other album. Both are able to stand on their own, but, when you hear the live original version of songs, the reissue make the songs lose all credibility of what was being performed. Shame on the person/s who would edit the live version and use the edited version, not the original. If you hear the original you will know exactly what I mean. Original 5 stars. this one 3."
3,Let's get off Mushroom please.,"Heart ""Magazine"" #17 (1978).This was an album of songs that got them out of their contract with Mushroom. ""Heartless"", #24 was the classic rocker, top-tier Heart. ""Devil Delight"", was a good high number. Their live version of ""I've Got The Music In Me"", is just great. Not the best of early Heart, but it is passable."
4,A must have for Heart fans,"I bought this LP way back in the 70's when it was under the Mushroom label, but the CD sounds so much better. Hearing it again is like revisiting with an old friend. Great re-makes of cover songs, but the original songs written by Heart are the standouts on this CD. No one can sing like Annie can!"
2,"Poor quality, 8 tracks",Pros: it wasn't too expensive. Cons: only 8 tracks and the audio quality is so bad that a digitized version of the LP would be better. Missing the best tracks.
4,Vinyl Collector's Item,"This album was released in 1978, but not many people know their original record label released several thousand copies in 1977, with all different recordings (except for the live track). We're talking vinyl here, CD's weren't around until about 1982. I have a copy of the 1977 version (not for sale), which I actually prefer to the 1978 release. I also have a copy of the 1978 release on picture disc. They were a hot trend in the late 1970's. If you like Heart and are seeking collector's items, check garage sales or used record stores for vinyl. If you see a copy of this LP, flip it over and check if the copyright date is 1977. If it is, pay them whatever they are asking and RUN!"
4,Like the Album Cover,A friend of mine looks just like Mojo so I bought the album for him. As it turns out the guy aint half bad. Mojo has a great sense of humor and you can figure out by looking at the titles to know what I mean. Definitely recommend to those who are not easily offended. Not for mixed company or children.
5,Gret knive covers,"These covers are excellent. I bought them to go with the JA Henckels Classic 4"" paring knife and the Classic 8"" Chef knife for my job working in a production kitchen. These knife covers have been an excellent way to keep my knives sharp and to keep my co-workers safe from accidentally cutting themselves on the sharp blades."
2,Overall not the best,"Other than the main event, the rest of it was pretty boring. Get wrestlemania 6,7, or 8"
5,WM12 IS ONE OF THE BEST WRESTLEMANIAS YET,"in WRESTLEMANIA 12 the 2 most awesoms battels took place 1the iron man match Shawn Michaels vs Bret ""Hit Man"" Hart{CHAPION} in iron man match is where both guys have t wrestle for 60 minites the one with the most pinfalls or submission is the winner iron man match is a classic match the other big match is Big Daddy Cool Diesel who faces the man from the dark side the Undertaker this match is also a classic battel also WM12 has Goldust vs Rowdy Roddy Piper in a Hollywood Back Lot Brawl this match took place in 2 places 1 out side and the othere in the ring this match was truly a Brawl WRESTLEMANIA 12 is a classic a most buy for any wrestling fan."
4,HBK Rules,"HBK and The Hitman for an hour. What else can I say? That alone is worth it. Piper and Goldust are funny and it is strange to see Austin before his days of 3:16. Great to see the future ""Game"" lose to the Ultimate Warrior."
1,Only Good if it is the original video not the WWF remake,This video stinks if it is not the Original coliseum release. you dont get the feel that the original gives you. the video quality is no good either
5,A Boyhood Dream has come true,"The longest Wrestlemania match ever and the longest match of all.1.Vader, Owen Hart & British Bulldog def. Yokozuna, Ahmed Johnson & Jake "" The Snake"" Roberts.With Vader score the Vader Bomb on Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts. 7/102.Rowdy Rowdy Piper battles Goldust in a Hollywood Backlot Brawl.It ended by Piper stripping Goldust and deliver more punches on him. 8/103.Stone Cold Steve Austin pinned Savio Vega 6/104.The Ultimate Warrior make his return to Wrestlemania and defeated Hunter Hearst Helmsly less than a minute. 7.5/105.Undertaker pinned Diesel with a Chokeslam, following the Tombstone. 10/106.Shawn Michaels pinned Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart with over an hour of wrestling and become the new champion. 10/10"
3,A one match show,"OK, I may recieve criticism for the ranking I gave this event, however, I am not rating the main event, rather the whole show. Now, I truly do believe that the Michaels/Hart Ironman WWF title match is one of the greatest in history, and a true five star match. Aside from this, the other matches are below average, especially the Back Lot Brawl (and Im a big Piper fan). The Taker/Diesel match was slow, and it felt that they didn't work hard. The return of the Warrior for the last time was good only because it was for the last time. the six man tag to open the video is a decent match and the second best of the show in my opinion. So 1/3 of the tape is 5 star, but the rest 2 star average. I recommed buying this for the Ironman match."
5,ONE MATCH TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY.,WHEN I FRIST SAW THIS VIDEO AND THE MAIN EVENT I THOUGHT THIS WAS BORING. ESPECIALLY SHAWN MICHAELS VS BRET HART IN A IRON MAN MATCH.ONE HOUR AND A MINUTE IT TOOK.THE UNDERTAKER VS BIG DADDY COOL DIESEL [KEVIN NASH].A GIANT LIKE KANE AND PSYCHO SID TO BEAT DIESEL IN A ONE ON ONE MATCH. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WHY WHY DIESEL LEFT THE WWF.NOW WE KNOW THAT KEVIN NASH IS COMING BACK.THESE TWO MATCHS MADE WRESTLEMANIA X11.P-S I KNOW RAZOR RAMON [SCOTT HALL] AND XPAC ARE NOT IN THIS TAPE.PS GET THIS TAPE NOW.
4,HBK and The Hitman,"What else do you need to know? They are worth the price alone. Piper and Goldust are funny. And it was wild to see The Ultimate Warrior demolish the future ""Game"". It was strange to see Austin before the famous 3:16 was in effect. HBK rules."
2,How things change....,"Austin a jobber? Triple H losing in 30 secounds? What is this? Jokes aside, this WrestleMania is decent. The Main Event is a FIVE STAR classic, but the rest is pretty bad. Diesel/UT is bad, but fun. Not worth it, but see the main event if you can."
1,One Of The Worst Wrestlemanias I Have Ever Seen.,"I Did Not Like This Wrestlemania Event At All. I Did Not Like The 60 Minute Iron Man Match At All. I Think HBK Did Screw The Hitman Out Of The Title. Bret Is One Of The Best Wrestlers Today. Also I Did Not Like The Undertaker And Kevin Nash Match. I Would Buy Wrestlemanias 3,4,6,7,8,9,10,And 11. Don't Waste Your Money On This Tape."
5,the best book on publishing I've ever read!,This is a must read for anyone who is already in or thinking about the publishing field. Mr. Monti's experience is evident throughout.
5,Adventure plus,"The Spanish Language version of Hatchet by Gary Paulsen, is a great adventure/survival story for middle school readers. Alone in the wilderness with only a hatchet to aid him, the young protagonist faces exterior forces and his own inner fears."
5,Juvenile Delinquency,"I enjoyed the book very much. It arrived promptly, and it arrived in a very good condition. The book was exactly what was needed for my class in Sociology."
1,false advisement,the book that i was looking for is the book thats in the picture. But when i finally got the book it was not the book thats shown. false advisement
2,Business and not football,"This was more of a business and preparing for the battle type of book than a book about football. It was an alright book to read, but unless you are looking for some direction or you really like Bill Parcells, then I would not purchase this book."
4,Great Resources,great images from all over the world (mostly europe and western countries. awesome graphics and photography.
3,Sweet and Fun,"This third entry in the enjoyable ""Hot Flash"" series brings back our buddies Faye, Alice, Marilyn and Polly, in a sequel that takes them through the year, from holiday to holiday.We follow the women through various triumphs and travails, from the appearance of Marilyn's elderly mother Ruth (a wonderful new character), who has become just a bit dotty, to the birth of new grandchildren, unwelcome family changes, relationships begun and ended, and other realities in any woman's life.The story, as always, is endearing, not too meaningful, not too heavy, not earth-shattering, but terribly sweet. I would like a lot less graphic descriptions of the characters' sundry hot flashes, and a bit more fleshing out of their grown children's strange (in many cases) relationships, but on the whole, I have no complaints.A lovely, heartwarming read, nice for an evening alone in front of the fire, or while lounging in the shade on a summer's day."
3,OK romance,"typical romance but a good group of women my daughter's ages, they fit in some of the categories these women fill."
3,Not what I perceived...,"I mistakenly thought that the checkerboard pans could also be used separately as baking pans. WRONG. The pans are quite shallow and aren't as nonstick as one would wish. The actual checkerboard pan is ingenious though, but I care naught for such a cake and returned the pans.Also, upon shipment, all the pans were stuck hard into each other. It took some time to pull them apart."
3,Checkerboard Cake Set,"I have only used the actual checkerboard set once, but more recently I have been using the cake pans by themselves. After a cake I made overflowed into the oven, I measured my pans and discovered that they are only 8 inch pans. I know these are the pans that came with the set as they are the only cake pans I've ever had and I still have the box (labeled to contain three 9 inch pans). I don't mind having the smaller pans, but it would have been nice to know that ahead of time. So if you are going to use the cake pans regularly- double check the size of the pan."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I was very excited to try these! When I received them, I was worried because the pans didn't feel like the typical non-stick pans. I brushed aside my fears and baked away. The first cakes stuck to the bottom of the pan. I tried another time with the same result. Very disappointing."
1,Gourmetware? More like junkware.,"These are the worst cake ""non-stick"" cake pans I've ever seen. Their surfaces are rough. In fact, I'm pretty sure a non-coated pan would work better than these. The pans came jammed together; I had to use a knife to pry them apart. Also the one crammed into the top had two dents in it. I would return them if it wasn't for the sunk shipping costs."
1,You get what you pay for,"I was very disappointed with this product. When it arrived, the pans were dented in and the plastic ring had one leg broken off. The overall quality of the cake pans was very cheap and flimsy. I returned them the next day and ended up finding good quality ones at my local Michael's craft store for $12.99. Think twice before buying this product and then decide otherwise."
5,Beats Baby Einstein movies,I much prefer these movies to the Baby Einstein movies. I love that my children are listening to praise music. And if I don't want my children to watch TV we just listen to the music without the TV on. It is also very uplifting for me to listen to while my children are playing.
3,More excitement please!,"My son doesn't care for these DVD's. They are more easy going and relaxed sounding. He likes more of upbeat music. Good songs though. Overall, C- rating for me!"
3,Sweet,This DVD was given to our daughter as a gift. The kids and illustration is cute and the music is sweet. It is far from Baby Einstein...I would suggest this as a gift!!!
3,Good but not great!,"Say You Love Me was an enjoyable read, for the most part. The hero, Luke, and the heroine, Jacie were a little too perfect and the love between them was too instantaneous for my taste. I prefer reading about the progress of a growing love rather than have the all-encompassing love be fated and inevitable. In my opinion, the sexual scenes weren't too detailed but the language was too exaggerated and flowery. (An orgasm was described as reaching ""celestial bliss,"" for example.) The plot was quite good as was the dialogue and the imagery was well described.******* SPOILER ALERT ******** The ending was good but I wish that Jacie could have been reunited with her mother.Overall, this book was a nice, light read and I would recommend it to others."
4,A good read,"Although this story dragged in some places, the concept was good and the love story grabbed me. I am a lover of western romance and this book was right up there. The characters were right up there and the storyline although a little wobbly at times was well thought out."
3,Good book,Looks amazing said was used but came looking brand new the book is okay for light reading not much plot
2,Not as good as I had hoped . . .,"My daughter loves the Little Bear show--I like it, too, so I bought her this game. Unfortunately, this game is really old (in computer years) so the technology is outdated which makes it more difficult and frustrating for my daughter to use. It also doesn't load on anything with an operating system newer than Windows XP, so it works on our old desktop but not my husband's new laptop. I would recommmend looking for a better game."
1,Large retractable dog leash,Took my 15 lbs dog and the leash came apart. I'm glad I didn't take my 80lbs dog. Not happy with purcharse
1,"""Judging Amy ""","Amy wasn't bad in the 80's and 90's, but this collection makes me think she's stayed too long at the Ball. I'd like to see her do another studio album of all original gospel music, but I guess that ship has sailed. Maybe this should be her swan-song ( pun intended )."
5,Cool!,Jessi is honored and surprised when she's asked to participate in a swimming competition. Will Jessi win the competition?
2,Lacks Reliability,"I bought this recorder for use in my college classes. It did not last two semesters! I am unable to transfer 50% of the files to my computer using their Digital Voice Manager software. I get an error message that says there is a 0 value. For the most part I am able to listen to the corrupted file on the recorder. However, I'm not sure how much of the recording I am able to retrieve. For example, on a 3 hour recording, I was able to hear all but the last 30 minutes of the lecture. It was caught in a loop. I'm now having to buy a new recorder since this one is unreliable!"
3,good product....,"while the product was perfect, it is a bit complicated to use...i recommend going through the instructions step by step several times...there are too many steps to do just one aspect of using it!"
2,RCA digital voice recorder 5022b,Only records for 2 hours and 8 minutes! Why do they advertise 26 hours??
4,I don't regret buying it - but it could be better,"I had an analog tape recorder before this and the audio quality was unbearable. This digital recorder is much better. There is some background noise from the recorder itself, but everything can still be heard clearly (even if the source is a long way away). The playback volume can be made surprisingly loud.The computer software that comes with it is light-weight (as in it doesn't use much memory or disk space) and reasonably easy to use. The interface for the recorder isn't very intuitive; it took me some time to get comfortable using the recorder. For example, the play button doubles as the on button and the stop button doubles as the off button (but they aren't labeled as ""on"" or ""off"").Overall, I like this recorder and I don't regret buying it."
1,Do not buy RCA RP 5022 or 5120 digital recorders,"RCA made poor voice recorders. I bought two and went useless (full and no room to record even no files in machine) in couple months. When I contacted RCA ""support"" department, I got unprofessional and useless reponse. I wish I have read some of your users' reviews before the factRCA Rp5022 64 Mb Voice Recorder With Usb. Now I buy Olympus."
2,Not What I Ordered,"If you have looked at the big box stores and want something better than they offer, this is not it. If you Google ""Franklin Brass D190-5BS"" you will get to the Liberty Hardware site, which describes this as ""commercial bath hardware"" and ""stainless steel curved shower rod"" with ""bright stainless steel"" finish. The thing that I received had no mention of Franklin Brass or Liberty Hardware on the packaging. It did not have ""bright stainless finish"", just thin steel tubing with chrome plating as you see in the home improvement places. The ends appear to be chrome plated zinc die cast, the hardware is not stainless steel. There are no installation instructions at all and no warranty, not a piece of paper of any kind, in fact.The quality is about what you see at Lowes or Home Depot. Amazon offered to return this for free but I kept it as it has a one-piece rod where the others have a two-piece, adjustable rod. Even without instructions, installation is fairly simple."
5,Phenomenal Double CD,"I purchased this CD just a couple of weeks before Yma Sumac's passing (on November 1 2008). There are 54 songs here, several of which I did not have (recorded in Argentina in 1943). Even with the primitive recording techniques of that time, Ms. Sumac's magnificent voice can be heard in it's formative (but still formidable) stage. Included here are her three songs from the very rare Broadway musical, ""Flahooley,"" which she appeared in. The liner notes are excellent, & there's an early B&W photo of her that's fascinating. For those of you who have all her LPs & previous CDs, this set is a must-have, just for the 1943 recordings alone. For those of you who haven't heard Ms. Sumac's singing, be warned that she is an experience like none you have ever heard before."
5,Essential reading on agrarianism,"This is a little gem - it provides a wonderful history of agrarianism in Western culture, illustrating how the concept has been adapted over time for different purposes."
3,Chef Hat,"This chef hat is cute and stylish. It is comfortable and fun to wear. If you want to look like a chef, this is a good choice. If you want to get something inexpensive and reasonable, however, I don't think this is the hat for you."
1,bad,"I bought this tv only 3 weeks ago and already there is several problems with it. right out of the box the power button on the tv did not work, the picture started flickering pink and blue within two weeks of the first use, and it would randomly shut off when ever it felt ike it. I WOULD NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT RECOMENDING THIS BRAND TO ANYONE!!!"
3,Tru Calling Seasons 1 & 2 DVD(s) Review (Part 1),"Now don't get me wrong. I love TRU CALLING. I'm a particular fan of the concept, and I love the actresses Eliza Dushku and A.J. Cook. Unfortunately it didn't live up to its potential for me, and I think the responsibility I'm sorry to say is that of the creator.The first season was pretty average, and the stories were good. They just didn't go as far as they could have done, particularly in the emotional scenes. Recent dramas like Ally McBeal and Buffy that have really tapped into emotions have set the bar really high. A bar a little too high for Tru Calling.That is Tru Calling - the first season. The second season on the other hand is a whole different story. So much better. It was released together with season 1 on DVD in the UK too. You can check out my review for season 2 when it's released in the US.TO BE CONTINUED..."
4,Another Great Show Axed,"At least the first season of this show was released on DVD. I really enjoyed this show. It had an interesting premise and Eliza Dushku is a great actress. This is just another example of TV executives cancelling another great show, while leaving TV viewers with more mindless reality shows and sitcoms to watch. Congrats FOX.Pick up this DVD it is great."
4,tru calling 2ed. seson,"arrived in great conduction, have not started watching it yet, sure it will also be great thanks."
3,repetetive & lacking argument,"tru calling is entertaining, but a bit repetitive, i can see why there wasn't a second series , it wouldnt have gotten any ratings at all. after all once youve repeated you day umteen times and saved the dead guy, what else is there ??, a feeble atempt to introduce a little intrigue with her father is weak and doesnt wash , but what the hell , easy viewing where you dont have to thing , just watch and switch oiff"
4,Tru Calliing,I enjoyed the show until they started showing Jason Priestly's character as evil. I think the show would have been better if they had shown both sides of the argument of wether it was right to save people and let the audience decide what was right.I loved the show until then though and will probably by the first season on DVD.
2,Uninteresting show,"The DVD release will probably be good for fans of the show, because Fox usually does a good job on their TV DVDs, but I did not like this show at all. Eliza Dushku is a talented actress, but it seems pretty clear that she only took this job for the money. The show itself is some tangled cross of CSI and NYPD Blue, using the most cliched elements from those shows and coming up with nothing fresh. Admittedly, the 2003-2004 season was a poor one for TV, with only 24, Alias, and Joan of Arcadia being good shows, but I recommend that those seeking something more sophisticated in TV than Dushku herself look elsewhere."
1,Don't wast your money.,"Tru Calling is an awful show. The concept is limited and the writing is poor and full of plot holes. The main character of Tru Davies is bland and whiny and the actress that plays her has absolutely no business playing the lead role in a tv show. The supporting cast of characters is weak as well. The only one with any potential was Tru's sister Meredith played by Jessica Collins, so the producers in their infinite wisdom wrote her out of the show abruptly in the middle of the season.If you are looking for an engaging fantasy show with a strong interesting female heroine...this isn't it. Go get Wonderfalls, that will fill the bill. Fox canceled Wonderfalls after just four episodes while letting this crappy show run for a full season. Unbelievable."
4,Tru Calling,"A decent series but nothing special.Tru Calling is about Tru Davies who dead people ask for help when they are murdered, good idea in theory but it's not good when your characters are very two demesional and your actors aren't that good.(saving Dushku and Gilafanakis (can't spell his name.)) The series takes off decently but the plots get repeatitive and you start to get bored and they do a very contrived plot twist and there are a few more plot twist afterwards. However! There are some really good episodes my favorites are Past Tense, The Longest Day, Murder in the Morgue. But unless your a Dushku fan I'd say rent it."
5,"foxey star, engaging scripts","Eliza Dushku is superb is the lead role; in fact, her wit and beauty make the darker moments of the storylines quite jarring, especially when you think you've figured out the plot but really have not. You root for Tru right from the start. The supporting cast is also first-rate. Production-wise, this DVD gets a five-star rating as well. If FOX had given the show a better, consistent time slot, it would have found a true calling from an audience. Thankfully, this boxset is available."
4,I miss this show,"It's interesting to watch the first season again. They really were working out a lot of the kinks, and they *did* seem to be on the right track for Season 2. It's too bad the plug was pulled.Overall, this package was very satisfying. The menus are easy to navigate. The character shots are nice. And the special features, while not mind-blowing, were nice to have. (I don't tend to find special features mind-blowing anyway, so from me, ""nice to have"" is a high compliment for special features.)This show was really going somewhere, and while I'm sad that it never made it, I'm glad I own what they did make to watch anytime."
5,Tru Calling a huge ratings winner!,"Hey all you people that don't know anything about the stuff you like!! Tru calling has not been cancelled!! it has been picked up for a second season(1/2 season)and will be back next year...for whatever reasons it has been delayed - thats all!! the show was a big rater, averaging around 4.6 million viewers per episode(with its peak being over 7 million viewers for one episode)- this all being quite impressive for a new show! the show itself is excellent and picks up where shows and films like Quantum Leap & the Butterfly Effect left off...a must see for Time Travel fans...Solid acting, solid stories, with every few episodes really packing a punch!!! Long Live Tru..."

2,Snoozable,"Carter has done some great space opera, some exciting series in the sword&sandal; genre. This tries. It takes place on a dying Earth, millenia hence. A mighty hero with an origin and a destiny clouded in mystery strides the world. He teams up with a timeless wizard, an eager lad, a warrior-cat, and, well, it hardly matters. Somehow, the toings and froings, saving this city and vanquishing that horde, never engage me. Plot? Well, since most events could be taken in any order, I'd call it a series of isolated episodes rather than a developing sequence of events. And all that mystery around Silvermane just has no effect on anything that takes place.I guess Carter needed the money. I really like a lot of his other work, including theGreen StarandCallistoseries. I just won't be coming back to this one.- wiredweird"
1,"Weak, watered down mathy metalcore","This band, though from the hot spot that the current crop of technical metalcore bands has sprung up from, is a poor representation of the genre. Simplistic drumming with hardly any fills, inaudible bass lines, boring guitar parts, and weak production (though that's not really a fault of the band) make this album a snooze - And not one of those pleasingly boring albums; this thing just sinks like the Titanic. There are a few points with interesting guitar parts, and the vocalist definitely has a grasp of his vocal style, but aside from them, this album definitely is not worth it, and as said above, is a very poor representation of this genre of music."
3,Vier Minuten soundtrack - personal review,I appreciate the electic collection of tracks on this album as glorifed from one of the most dramatic movies i've ever seen. The multidimensional tracks range from percussion rhythm to a piano solo is absolutely breathtaking.
2,Pan coating sticks to the bread!,"I've tried this pan at least a dozen times now to cook or daily bread. It's the perfect size for our sandwich loaves and I chose this pan because of that and the great reviews. I can't recommend this pan though, at least not for yeast doughs. I only lightly grease the pan when making sandwich breads and every single time, a bunch of the pan coating stays on the bread! I don't understand it since this is an 'uncoated pan'. It looks like Teflon flakes cook into the side of my bread. Plus, it doesn't cook as evenly as I find darker bread pans too. The top of the bread will look perfectly brown, but the bottom is often white and undercooked. I've been taking it out of the pan when the top of the bread is done, and putting the loaf back in the oven for another 5-10 minutes to get the bottom fully baked correctly. Off to find a better sandwich loaf baking pan. Tired of scraping metal off the bread every time."
5,Perfect for Yeast Breads,"This has been a great loaf pan. I haven't had any issues with bread sticking. It cooks evenly and cleans easily. No rust or warping either.Update: This pan is still going strong. I make sandwich bread regularly with zero sticking. I literally wipe the pan out with a dry or damp cloth and put it away. My breads cook evenly every time. I don't love the pan for cake-type breads. I prefer glass or ceramic for that, but it is perfect for yeast breads. HIghly recommend!"
5,1-lb Chicago Metallic Commercial Loaf Pan,Product arrived quickly. Was in excellent condition. Would order from Amazon again. I ordered 2 loaf pans.
2,Metal residue on pans,"I am a frequent home baker. After years of using non-stick pans, I was super excited to get some good old metal pans. I bought four. The pans are nice sized, heaby duty, conduct well, etc. I am pleased with their baking performance. HOWEVER, I have had the pans for over 6 months now and the pans still have a metallic residue. After a good washing, when I pick up the dry pans, my fingers are gray. I have to wipe down the pans before using every time. I called the company and they said the residue should go away after a good washing. I have scrubbed by hand, by wash rag, scrubber, dishwasher, on and on to no avail. While the pans may work well, I don't like the idea of some sort of pan residue baking onto my food."
3,"Good, but Be Safe..","I use these perches with all four of my birds...a Cockatiel, Quaker, Senegal, and Conure. It helps to have a different kind of surface for them to walk on during the day, and this perch was recommended by my vet for my Quaker, who has arthritis. The perch appears to be very comfortable for them. That said, the birds also like to chew on it (it is very colorful!). So, it is necessary for me to trim the perch on a regular basis so as not to create a foot hazard from lots of loose string hanging out all over the place! (I had not kept close enough of an eye at one point, and my Quaker got his foot stuck in excess loose string!)"
5,Great Perch,"My birds love these perches!! Received super fast, and great quality!! Very easy to put on the cage, and the value you cannot beat!!"
4,Great perch,Purchased the small sized one for my love bird. She really likes it and it almost seems as if she is always happy now. I recommend this to all my friends who have birds!
3,My parrot chewed right threw it within days!,"I guess I made a bad choice buying this for my cockatoo, just thought it would be more comfortable for his feet!"
1,"OK for huge birds, NOT keets!","I bought this for my keet thinking it was keet size, NO WAY! It is big enough for a BALD EAGLE! I had to return it for credit."
2,Who edited this book?,"Well, this book is filled with lots of interesting stories, but it's so disorganized it seems like it was written by an Jazz age drunk! Better editing would have done wonders for this book which has great stories about some of the celebrities of the 1920's, but flows sloppily from one anecdote to another."
5,Great Green Tea,"This tea ia great if you are looking fro DECAF GREEN TEA which is pretty much the best thing you can drink besides water, great taste, you dont need ANY sweeteners!!!"
4,Yum Yum is true,"For fans of the Violent Femmes, Danielson Familie, They Might Be Giants and such this is a refreshing treat. Joy and celebration with a twitchy edge."
3,Better than getting the Special Edition CD,"The Ewan Pearson Remix of ""Enjoy The Silence"" and Cicada's remix of ""World In My Eyes"" are very much worth the price of the import. You can get it domestic (and why Amazon isn't selling the cheaper domestic release is beyond me) and you will be pleased. These mixes get DM fans on the floor fast."
1,Not for me...,"I was filled with anticipation when my book arrived and was looking forward to reading it. What a disappointment! I didn't even get past page 8. It bored me to death. I think that this book is such a waste of time. I was so disappointed with it I immediately sold it. If you're planning to read some erotica, better read Anais Nin's 'Delta of Venus"". Now that is a good book!"
1,Oh my gosh!!!,"I thought this book transended any kind of morals or values that my mother taught me. This kind of work can hardly be called literature, and definately not a classic. I do not believe in banning books, but if I did then this would be at the top of my list."
1,I wish I had not read it,"I wish I had not read it.Very, very cleverly and smoothly written to seduce you into thinking this sickness is erotic. Pages and pages of philosophical claptrap that seduces the reader to ""buy into"" a few pages of very arousing scenes.After you have read it there is a bad kickback due to the impersonal cruelty of the men, the self-humiliation of the women, and the the corruption of the child. I recently shredded my copy.I wish I had not read it."
2,"Mediocre, at best","I read The Story of O after seeing it referenced a few times in someone else's story. The idea was good -- get a peek inside this particular lifestyle (and for some people, it really is a lifestyle or way of life) and O's head at the same time -- but the writing was only so-so. It read like a high school boy's fantasy. The material itself was not the least bit shocking to me and I was not offended by any of it. But I've read fanfiction that was written better. I was not impressed. I'm glad I didn't pay to read it."
2,A Great Disappointment.,"To give this book any more than two stars would be a mere act of pity. This book is more a psychological study of a disturbed woman, and a bunch of extremely domineering males than any sort of erotic tale. I was far too busy wondering when she was going to grab the riding crop and beat Rene and Sir Stephen until they cried for her mercy to get any sort of enjoyable sexual charge out of this story. I also found the writing style to be extremely redundant, and the ""plot"" to be no more than a series of the same beatings and sexual mistreatments in different settings. And the issues above are nothing compared to the fact that they cut off the ending. You don't get to find out what happens to O, much less poor little Natalie, an impressionable fifteen-year-old who is sucked into this world by Sir Stephen. The summary of the missing conclusion is one sentence long. I think that speaks to the importance the book places on any sort of plotline. As I said, a great disappointment."
2,"Oh look, she's getting gang raped - *again*","My fantasies tend to be of the very perverse and violent nature, so I was looking forward to reading L'Histoire d'O. I had a long plane ride, and was hoping it would help me while away the house.Alas, O proved to be boring in the extreme. My thoughts were pretty much ""Oh look, she's getting beaten again"" and ""Oh look, she's getting gang raped again"" and ""Oh look, she's being sodomized again."" How boring. How dull. There was no tension at all in the book, because there was no conflict. O just accepts everything that happens to her. In order for a story to be interesting, there must be some sort of conflict that needs to be resolved. There is none in this novel.It seems to me that the author tried to get by on the shock value alone, which is not enough in and of itself to make a book worth reading. Plot helps, too."
2,Time had sullened this great book!,"The story of O could easily had earned a 4 or 5 stars rating when it first came out decades ago. It was one of the very first books of its kind, and it had a huge shock value as well as creative value back then. But during the intermediate years from its published date to our present time, the sexual revolution had already made a lot of changes to the SM landscape. Many new theories and techniques on SM literature had been developed since, which in turn had made the ideas and writings in 'the story of O' seem very primative and out of date. My bottom line is that it's not worth awhile to spent money or time on this book unless: 1) you are doing a research on the history of erotica/literature 2) you are an avid collector and want to collect all the erotica writings there is"
2,zzzzzzzzzzzz,"Ugh. This is so boring I haven't been able to finish it in over 8 months.I usually read it before I go to bed at night, not to get turned on, but to help me fall asleep. Seriously. My mother had a hidden copy of this book, and it was a BIG DEAL that I never go near it because of the ADULT story. This naturally only made me want to read it more. I should have known it was just a big snooze fest. Maybe it was shocking in the 70's but to read it now is just a let down. O is one of the weakest and most pathetic characters imaginable. I guess it gives you an idea of what a bdsm relationship might be like, day to day, but I could have done with out."
5,"A Great book, a twentieth century classic","Some reviewers criticize this book as not being an accurate portrayal of the 'S & M lifestyle.' It should be pointed out that this book was never written to be such a book!Don't lay your expectations on this book, and you'll likely enjoy it. Whether or not you believe the events to have actually happened, it is very possible to suspend your disbelief and read it as biographical. It is a very well written book (both in the original French and the English translation).Those readers who slag it for not being 'accurate' are just reading to see their own take on the whole issue. They would like to see their own lives in print. Well, this is not the book for them, and it is NOT why Pauline Reage wrote it.Toss your expectations, open up this book, and prepare to be entertained, shocked, repulsed, and turned on."
5,Definitely a Classic!,"I read The Story of O a few years ago and i've read it a few times again since then. This is definitely NOT a guide to s&m acts but a very serious study on human behavior and to what lenghts people are willing to go for their true love. Very disturbing at times, especially since i've never read anything on this subject before, but excellent read!"
2,One woman's fantasy,"In a nutshell, this book is really sexy if you share the author's fantasy, and really boring if you don't. It's endlessly repetitive, and there's no plot or real characterization; in fact, nothing happens in this book, other than the constant sex and abuse. If you're just looking for a competently-written story about a girl getting sexed up and treated poorly by a succession of masters, you'll love this book. Otherwise, your time would be better spent on erotica that does cater to your tastes."
2,just couldn't get into it,"I won't even bother to make an argument about this novel's disregarding the ""safe, sane and consentual"" credo of the BDSM community. Hopefully readers who haven't ""dabbled"" in the scene for real will still realize that this book is disturbing and unrealistic. My gripes: the style of writing is a little euphemistic for me, epsecially when it comes to descriptions of bodies. The clothing descriptions are long and tedious. I don't see why every single erotic tome in the world has to include lesbian scenes. And none of my five senses came alive as they did when I read 9 and 1/2 Weeks. The only thing I liked about ""O"" was the setting in France. There are far better novels about power play in relationships."
4,Deliciously erotic,"I have always been a fan of light S/M (aka D/S)and even though 'O' transcends the level of play I have always found enjoyable it is still an excellent read and trip into classic erotic lit.For a nice intro to S&M Try ""Sensuous Magic : A Guide for Adventurous Couples"" by Pat Califia. An excellent book to learn the ropes with! :p"
3,"""O"" is definitely different","This was my first experience with S&M literature and it was quite an experience. First, to see how this lifestyle can indeed BE a lifestyle and how far one can be drawn into it. The second amazing fact was that this book was written in the 1950's. I imagine that there was, and still is quite an underground following for this book."
2,What about the ending?!,"I purchased the Story of O with great excitement and could not wait for it to come in and read it. It was everything I had heard and hoped it would be, HOWEVER, after you're reeled into the story and you want to know more the ""FINAL CHAPTER HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED"". I was not happy. I still have no idea what happened! Before purchasing I suggest you contact the seller and see if it has a suppressed ending or if you are purchasing the full book. Good Luck!"
4,not to be taken at face value,"most people seem to get offended when they read this book. O does victimize herself, but it's a willing surrender, she is detaching herself from her body, desensitizing herself. i don't agree with what she's done, nor can i understand that sort of mentality. however, that makes the book all that more interesting, to see viewpoints and thoughts of others."
3,A true classic.,"The Story of O is a guidline for all dicipline minded erotica. However, I felt the moments of passion could hve included a more involved description of O's own feelings. I know it's supposed to be a classic but I felt too much time was spent describing the actions and not enough on the emotions."
2,Not as Titilating as People Think,"Sure, it has moments of fantasy hotness. But by the standards of what people I know are doing in their own bedrooms these days, much of O is really quite tame. It's the ""thought of it"" that titillates our naughty bits. The book touches on various concepts and extreme practices, like shaping-corsetry and branding, but in a glossed over manner.Read it so you can say you read it, and then go read one of my own books to read something far more engaging, detailed and realistic.PEEPER (Gethis: History of a Planet)The Healer (Gethis: History of a Planet)"
2,not my favorite book,"I didn't like this book as well as I thought I was going to. I was disappointed in the ending. It was very hard to read, jumping back and forth from English and French and points of time. A lot of imagination had to be used when the writer described things."
1,Story of...-O,The first 20-30 pages of this book kept my attention. I agree with the other lessor reviews in that this book went nowhere. I kept expecting it to get better and it never did.There was no character development. The abusiveness was repetitious. There were no other characters that held my attention. Those involved in this lifestyle must like this book simply because it justifies something for them... disappointing are the best words I can think of to describe this book...
2,not what I expected,I just couldn't relate to O. She did everything I wouldn't. I was just bored with her story although I did finish it. I guess I thought that it might get better and that O might wake up one day and realize that she didn't have to live this terrible life. The torture didn't even seem to turn her on. She just seemed miserable. It was a miserable tale.
1,nothing of the classic ive been told about,"yuck!! after all the hype, i set myself down to read a riveting story about one womans journey thru this lifestyle and got up a few hours later thinking whats the draw in this one??? i believe that the fact that this was written so long ago is one of the things that people find so appealing about this...perhaps im wrong, however, i found this, The Story of O, to be a total bore and im none the better for reading it..."
4,sexual metaphor,"As far as the structure of the novel itself goes, The Story of O is amazingly engaging. I say engaging because as one reads, one becomes intrinsically involved in and empathetic to O's experiences and situations.However, one searching for eroticism should not read this book; despite the events in the story, this book is neither sexual nor erotic in nature. Much more prominent are the male vs. female , human vs. inhuman plots that occupy life. Additionally, the tone of the book and the characters lead me to suspect that this story was written by a man and not a woman, which serves to alter the reader's appreciation and understanding of the novel."
2,adult book,"This novel is very well written. It's a very unusual erotic s&m novel written by a woman in a time when this was pretty much unheard of. I was a little disappointed in the book because it was very short and glossed over everything instead of going into more details of the characters. I felt it did not delve into their motivations or backgrounds or really let you know them. There was no hero or heroine and no one that you cared about. What really upset me about this book though, is that one is cheated out of the ending! This book is missing the ending. There supposedly are two but they have been censored from this edition! I would not buy this book again and do not recommend it because of that. I feel as though I have been cheated and would not have bought it if I knew that I would not get the ending ahead of time. Shame on Amazon for not warning customers that the ending has been censored out of this book!"
4,Intriguing Story!!!!,"Book is very erotic and intriguing. However, extremely sad also. The author is extremely descriptive in explaining what the setting and surroundings look like almost to a point of loosing interest because you want to know more of O's thoughts and feelings not how she dresses and what the french apt. looks like and the 20 different flowers that are in the courtyard."
3,Underwhelming...,"I may be jaded because of the more freely written kink we have access to now, but the book seemed disjointed in SO many ways: character development, story line, purpose of relationships and lessons learned from Dom to sub... I can only imagine some of it is because of being translated, but honestly I was disappointed in what I'd anticipated to be a revelation in a sub's journey to become who she was meant to be.It seemed so very similar to The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy, only as a much MUCH more watered down version. Then again, maybe I'm just spoiled with the reading I have such easy access to, and this book was written by a woman in a time when the topic was beyond taboo, much less the thought of writing a book about said topic.For what it is, and the origin of the book, I'm giving it a courtesy of 3/5 stars."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Fairly gratuitous erotica but would appeal to those who enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey. Clothed in respectability as a novel but in reality, soft core pornography."
3,"The Story is Enthralling, but the Lack of Ending Upsetting","I'm not sure what ending other versions of the book come with, but this one includes two one liner type endings that just kill you after reading such an absorbing book. I definitely reccomend the book, but not this edition."
3,Dissapointed with the ending,"This is a beautifully written story, but beware: if you're a stickler for a good ending, like me, you WILL be disappointed. I was turning the pages as quickly as I could, engrossed in my curiosity of what would happen to O next, and then the story was over without any sort of resolution whatsoever. The last page tells you that there were two final chapters written by the author, neither of which is included in this book. And I hated not having the slightest idea of what became of Jaqueline. All in all, it's an enchanting story, but the abrupt ending was such a disappointment for me that I will probably not read it again."
3,not that good,"The people that said this book is ""erotic"" must also consider a kick in the nuts to be foreplay. There's very little that is erotic or even sexy in this book. Some crazy broad named O likes getting abused for no reason. In the end, her lover dumps her for a model. No surprises there.Want erotic? Read Delta of Venus, by Anais Nin. Way better."
1,beat me daddY,"Silly but harmless. Amazing how this has survived so many years, as it isn't a ""classic"" or ""deep"" - although there are some for whom it is a life changing event. Who knows - perhaps it will be for you also? But you may find the dark side pretty crowded already when you ""cross over."" You might be surprised at who has read this supposedly sexy but actually cold little book. So many of your friends and co-workers. Your boss. Your Mom's lawyer. Your real-estate person. The guy behind the counter at the convenience store. Everybody in fact. Or almost. What a strange world we live in. Soon it will be spring."
1,one of the worst books I have ever read,"I have read a lot of books, but this book is the worst I have ever read. I am no stranger to erotic books but this book just left me cold; There were no positive emotions between the main characters. Do not buy this book."
2,Very hard story to follow,"I read 50 shades of grey and was told this book was better. I was disappointed that it was not. A waste of money in my opinion. Too hard to follow, scenes not vivid enough, writer definitely cannot write good scenes. Made no sense whatsoever."
5,Past Reviews,"This book was not written by an anonymous man. It was written by Pauline as a way of telling her husband that women CAN write erotic literature. Her husband wrote the introduction to the story of O in some editions. I believe that one pof the essays were called Happiness in Slavery. One night, while lying in bed, her husband told her that only men can write erotic literature. One year later, on his birthday, she gave him the story of O. Which he wrote the intro to and had published.They know that hse had written now because they found her beforfe she died with the original manuscript written in her hand writting.She wrote this book."
3,Well-written but I hated it,"I am into S&M myself and I hated the Story of O. It was disturbing to me and rapidly became a complete turn-off. I didn't get past the first 2 chapters. One of the reviewers said this is a story of love. I couldn't disagree more-- what a twisted idea of love. O gives up her Self, becoming merely a thing, to the point that she is offed at the end of the book. How can there be love when there is no self? Does one love a possession? Do you love your T.V. set? I don't think so.This is obviously the sort of book that you either love or hate. There is no middle ground.One of the reviewers mentioned open-mindedness. S&Mers can be as closeminded as anybody, and then some. I told a fellow pervert that I hated the Story of O, and she said that people are going to be puzzled by my ""strange"" concept of domination and submission. I didn't find that very open-minded. Physician, heal thyself."
5,It's fantastic!,"I am very new to the world of S/M, but certainly in for it. I read this book to help me see what it is that goes on inside of me, though the book appear really hard and scary at times, there is so much truth in it. There is a certain amount of greatness and joy in submitting totally to other's will and to find yourself - at last! - freed from the weight of your own lusts, interests and complexes! I strongly recommend it."
4,Not for the faint of heart or those looking for a sex fix,"Definitley an interesting read. Delving into how one can give themself up so completely and utterly... in it's own frightening way it can actually make you feel liberated in knowing how and why you give yourself up to someone (albeit not necessarily in such a fashion as O). The erotic content is subtle and is masked behind the rest of the story as well as what O endures... and that is part of the erotic content. If that is not understood it's just a story about a woman being tied up, used, whipped and branded. Not too erotic if you think about it. But in the context of the story, she endures it to show her love and devotion, and that is where it becomes erotic. Delving into the human psyche and uncovering that little part in all of us that wants to give ourselves completely to the one we love. However, if your looking for a quick, one handed read, this will not provide it. It's thinking erotica, definitely"
5,"""The"" classic novel of the dominance/submission genre","By far the best novel of the dominance and submission genre, or if you will, the sadomasochistic genre, The Story of O captures its reader in the bonds of its dark world of sexual slavery. As O is drawn further into the enticing confines of total submission to the men that use her, we the readers find ourselves unable to put the book down, as we are horrified and delighted simultaneously. Although not for the fainthearted, anyone with a strong erotic imagination will certainly enjoy this classic work of fiction"
3,So-So O,"I must say I was disappointed by this book. Parts of it were arousing and well written, other parts just gratuitous sadism. It is my understanding that there are people who enjoy that sort of thing, and for those people I would highly recommend this book. For those of you looking for a ""blindfold and feather"" book, look elsewhere. This is a story about riding crops, bullwhips, and even branding. For those of you with a weak stomach for sexual deviancy, I would advise you not to read this book.I found the characters unrealistic. Their personalities vary widely from chapter to chapter, and this makes for a confusing read. At least it's a quick one. Unfortunately, I just didn't really like it. I'm sure that there's plenty of more gratifying erotic literature out there. Thise one left me wanting a different ending."
2,Disjointed story with violent themes; insider-only appeal,"I am fascinated by BDSM myself, and I still think this text is weak with limited appeal to a fringe audience. While it's true that the detail in description of the scenes was sharp, the description lacked a window into the heroine's mind, so that the scenes are only tintilating if acute descriptions of gratuitious violence are your thing. The storyline jumped disjointedly from one inexplicable turn of events to another, without any insight into what would make the characters behave in such a way. In short, it makes a frustrating read for those interested in power exchange but turned off by extreme abuse, and a mystifying read for those not already familiar with the sexual cliches of BDSM."
1,Rule of Bondage,"An Important rule of Bondage is ""If you break your toys, you aren't allowed to play with them any more."" In this book, O isn't treated as a toy so much as an annoyance to reduced, abused and disposed of. I do not reccomend this book."
5,A really intense read.,"Okay, I would say this is BDSM but AMPED up. The story really goes into some darker territory than I am used to, as this is about total submission, along total enslavery. It starts out innocently enough, then gets darker and darker. While this isn't one I'd want to read over and over, it is good and a classic read. So, yeah, I'd recommend it, along withThe Claiming of Sleeping Beauty."
3,"Inspirational, but silly at times","In my opinion, this is a good ""romance"" novel. I don't mean it's one of those crap fest books with a picture of a shirtless man on the cover, but the content is comparable.What I liked about it - The vocabulary. The vocabulary of the book helped me out greatly because I'm always in search of different words. Also I found her similes incredible. Truly stimulating. Full of ideas that have changed my sex life for the better. My girl friend sends her gratitude.What I didn't like about it - I found it rather dry and corny at times, hints to why I slightly compare it to a traditional romance novel. To give one of the many examples : When O leaves the chateau and arrives at another location, she begins to go through the make up Rene (her lover) has chosen for her. I guess you'd have to be me to get it, but I found that rather silly.Over all, I highly recommend this book, but I'll most likely never read it again."
2,Provokative or Provincial?,"Maybe it's because she wrote the book so long ago, but I really got the impression that Reage was trying too hard with the shock effect in this novel. Any initial shock wears off shortly, because sexually explicit descriptions are so indiscriminately employed! Therefore, by the fifteenth page, The Story of O loses any potential eroticism it might have suggested at the beginning; actually, I found the story pretty banal by the end. It's still worth the read, though--if for no other reason to discover what all the hype is about, and for those first fifteen-or-so pages."
4,The classic S&M story,"You can say what you will about BDSM, and you can say what you will about whether what happened to O in this book is realistic. The fact remains that it is the reference for all the BDSM/erotic stories that have followed. In that respect, it was a true groundbreaker and deserves to be read. The translation is true to the style of the original -- intimate but never prurient or dirty (only incidentally so).I personally found the story intensely erotic, and it remains that way for me even after multiple readings. As a fiction, the plot moves along at the rate of a typical French story (i.e., slowly but with interior reflection and attention to detail). As a classic piece of fiction, I recommend this book. A primer on BDSM it's not, but it's still fun to read."
2,cold and unfeeling,"I wanted to like this book, really I did. I had heard so many good things about it. Then I read it.The story lacks passion/lust/love/hate and it shows. I just wanted to shake O and say ""FEEL something damnit!"" Thank god most real D/s relationships arn't this cold or we all would be suffering from frost bite."
2,The Story of O,"I started reading ""O"" with the expectations that this book held many of the secrets of what makes a submissive/slave submit. It was interesting, but I found myself forcing myself to read further, hoping I might get to the ""good part"". I know that it was considered provocative at the time of its release, it is rather tame to anyone who has read amateur erotica published today. After reading it, I passed it on to a ""friend"" ... would I suggest anyone buy it. NO. But if you can borrow a copy or own a copy, share it freely."
2,"O is for ""Ouch""","Perhaps I'm coming at _Story of O_ from a completely different direction, since I was hardly compelled to feel anything toward the characters in the novel. The translation of Reage's novel is bumpy and broken, and often it is difficult to follow thought patterns and dialogue of the characters. If readers do manage to make sense of the prose, they will find a story of whips and chains, S/M, bondage, and so forth--actions still considered taboo in most social circles. Readers will find the central character, O, enigmatic, confounding, and ambivalent: Why would anyone submit themselves to such emotional and phyiscal pain? Love would be the most obvious answer, but surely Reage was thinking of something more postmodern ... Of course these are purely subjective thoughts of mine. One must remember, while reading this book, that one's dislike of pain is another's passion."
2,Nothing more than slightly senstionalist.....,"One of my friends told me this was a really gripping story of human emotions and what people can be driven to... I wish she had told me she was joking BEFORE I bought the book! This is, at the very most, basic sensationalism.This book does not even have an ending!!! It builds up towards a huge finale and then stops dead, apparently because the last chapter was banned years ago, c'mon give us a break!!!!!!!!Trust me, only teenagers will be left amazed at this particualr book!"
2,Almost Tame By Today's Standards,"It is hard to believe in this day and age that O does what she does - giving herself so completely over to a lover. I am still not sure what her motivations were. The story is quite choppy and I can imagine that it was risqué when first published, but it is almost tame compared to what one can see online today."
2,Interesting &#65533; but not a must read,The story of O is really just that. A story of a lady named O who is in an S&M relationship - although you get the feeling that she wouldn't choose it. An eye opener to see how people who are into S&M live - but not a literary work of art though.
3,Fickle,"Many others say that this book is about more than just bondage and S & M, but a tale of love. I think it is more about discipline and submission and how men truely do like that, than it is about ""love"". O is fickle when it comes to her lover(s), which leads one to believe she isn't really in love with any of them. The novel did not distub me in any way, but it also leads one to believe that most people find this okay, which we know is not the case. It definately fits the genre for whom it was intended, and for that I agree it is a work of fine fiction."
3,Exciting stuff but ultimately boring,"The individual scenes in this book can be very erotic and powerful. However, beyond the description of the actual events, this story goes nowhere. In the end, the things O is willing to have done to her stretch the bounds of believability."
1,A Story About Slavery,"I come to this book for love and sex. I was wrong. It has nothing to do with love or even sex. It is a story of violence and slavery. And how effective violence is, in the author's whimsical imagination, in enslaving women. Just like history of slavery and colony rule in 19th century and early this century has shown us, slave owners always justify themselves by that slaves enjoy being exploit by nature. That slaves enjoy to be whiped, used, exploited, and disposed at owner's will. That is why O was told to be always available, accessible, and obedient sexually to her owner Rene. She was finally given away and exploited to death. I wish I have the opportunity to exploit the author the way Rene exploit O, no matter the anonymous author is a male or female. That satisfys my feeling of revenge and probably the cruelty inside me."
4,"Excellent, a compulsive page turner","Since my girlfriend and I are into the D/s lifestyle, she really identifies with the power of the heroine. The story is written tastefully yet vividly.A classic that needs be in most every well-rounded library"
2,Disturbing,"The Story of O wasn't what I was expecting. I thought it would be a love story describing the intense, kinky, sensual, relationship between a dom and his submissive parter. However, it wasn't - it was about a woman who was used, abused, and discarded. I was impressed and was disappointed."
2,STORY OF O..,"WRITTEN VERY ""EUROPEAN"", THE STORY LINE IS DECENT, THE S AND M IS MOSTLY WHIPPING, IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A HOT READ TRY BLUE THE COLOR OF DESIRE, WHICH IS A LITTLE MORE RAW. IF YOU WANT A MORE TAME READ THIS MIGHT BE FOR YOU. I PERSONALLY DONT FIND DESCRIPTIONS SUCH AS ""FLANKS"" AND ""NETHER REGIONS"" TOO STIMULATING."
1,An aberration,"This story is horrible, disgusting, filthy, dehumanizing. An aberration, a perfect depiction of evil. It's good for what it shows about what evil is and what evil cand do to a human soul.I'm not one for censorship; let people think, write, read, do as they want when not in violation of the law or the rights of others, but also let people call things for what they are. And, as someone wrote on another review, if you have felt guilty for having wanted to subject another human being to any of these things, then you should feel guilty. Try to figure out where that comes from and address it. You are too precious to live like that. Don't let anything or anyone lead you to believe otherwise. ""To deny the dignity of a human being is to deny the dignity of every human being."""
1,Eh... Didnt like it,Im all for S&M...; but this book was kinda wordy to me...Not to mention it was hard to get into.I'd rather read Anne Rice
3,Ok read,"So this was not what I expected and I dont think it lived up to the hype. It was very erotic in places, exciting, and weird in others and flat out CRAPPY in some places. And the ending blah. That being said if youre curious about S/M it is worth the read.3 1/2 stars is better but that wasnt offered.Ps :Check out Power Exchange (Christina Brashear)..that book has a bit of everything including genuwine affection.LOVE!"
3,Not worth the money,"this book was suggested to me to buy,,,, probably due to I had all 3 Shades of Grey books and loved them. This one isnt even on the same level. Waste of money, sorry........."
2,Not for me.,"I loved all three Fifty shades. It was first of all a great story with characters that were compelling. This is not a story with understandable characters. Not because of the subject of the material, but the author doesn't give even minimal insights into the nature of the characters. There is only ""they did this, and they did that"" with no ""why"". If you want to read something after Fifty Shdaes, I would not bother with this one."
2,Not really what I expected,"I don't quite know why this book was actually considered one of the best French books of the 1950s. Yes, it talks about sexual slavery and people taking seriously their fetishes, but to be honest, I found it quite beyond boring, and it was almost a torture to force myself to keep reading it. I am planning to rent the movie soon, maybe it ends up being better, but the book is slow, it's about two hundred pages of a story that could be told a lot better in just twenty!"
2,Those who like this sort of thing will like this,"This book started promisingly with a description of how O's boyfriend removed her underwear during a taxi ride; this was good, sophisticated erotica. After this, there was an awful scene where O was whipped. There was more good stuff as O had to go about her normal daily life with no underwear or suspenders and to roll the tops of her stockings to stop them from from falling down. However, after this O was treated more and more cruelly and eventually mutilated with a red-hot branding iron. This required a strong stomach. Beware - only read this book if you can stand such writing. I doubt that this book was really written by a woman; it doesn't have the right feel."
3,Vol.3 goes beyond the original work.,"This,the third volume of Guido Crepax's illustrated series of books based on the classic ""Story of O"", goes beyond the original work. It relates the Story of O, obviously after her return to the chateau. At this point in her life, she seems to be using her sensuality and what she has learned with Sir Stephen to target and destroy certain individuals, apparently for hire. This is not as good a book as either the original text version, or his two other illustrated volumes, although it is good enough that those who enjoyed the others will probably like this one. More Crepax than Reage, and it shows. Finally, this volume appears to anticipate the ""New Story of O"", which has recently been published."
3,O is well..........OK,"Great shocker when the book was first published, for 2013 makes for slow reading. But for my 8 hard earned dollars, I will finish it!!!!!"
4,One of my favorites,"This book was my first introduction into the world of submissiveness. Before I read this, I had no idea that there was a formal separation of power between a man and a woman. Obviously, this is just a casual book about an affair in France that would be thought of as nothing today. But, when I read it as a young American woman, I was mesmerized that a woman would go to such extremes to please a man. It makes me blush just thinking about it."
4,a good books,"I have read this book many times. It is very sexy. It is not at all a phantasy, since men and women do quite strange things to one another. it is well written and not really disturbing."
3,Disappointing Ending,"I was enjoying this book to the end, and they deleted the ending. It said that the end was removed. There is just a paragraph or two to summarize the end. Very disappointing."
3,"If love does not lift,it is not love.","I rate this book average because it is the thoughts of most people. This is not love,it is victimization,self-abuse and a power stroggle from a man. Even if a woman participates in these kinds of things,her motivation is love,in the sense to do anything to keep this person. Sad,that we would become so desperate for someone.I feel if we love ourselves eventually we will see that we do not need that excess stimulation.O died,not for love but because of torment."
1,Am I the only one who ordered this.......,"....and received a comic book about O? Did I miss something? I'm reading reviews by others about a novel which contains chapters and what I got was a black and white comic book. This isn't what I thought I was ordering at all. I'll send this back, but I'm wary to buy other books online. There should be clearer descriptions."
5,Louis L'Amour books,I bought this book for my Dad last Christmas. He loves western books and also Louis L'Amour is one of his favorite authors. He loved it.
2,Extremely inconsistent group of new Cthulhu Mythos tales,"This is volume 4 from Chaosium's series of Cthulhu Mythos fiction. The Cthulhu Mythos was created by H.P. Lovecraft in a series of short stories published in the 1920's and 30's. In this mythology, the earth was previously inhabited by alien, ""godlike"" entities who will return ""when the stars are right"". Many writers have added to the underlying mythology since Lovecraft's death including Robert Bloch, Ramsey Campbell, and Brian Lumley. This book contains little that is of the quality you'd find from those authors. This volume contains 16 new works of fiction & 2 stories from the 60's, one by Hugh B. Cave and one by Ramsey Campbell. These two older stories were the only ones I enjoyed very much. Many of the rest were extremely amateur. You can find on the WWW short stories of equal quality that will cost you nothing. Overall, not a book I would recomend."
1,I contest the will!,"If these are Cthulhu's heirs I contest the will. This was summarilly the worst expression of Lovecratf's weird fantast genre. The imbecilic overtones and dishwater plots reflect more the 1980's ""Nightmare on Elm street"" style of teenie slasher films far closer than any resemblance of the erudite and late Mr. Lovecraft.It is a sheer marvel that these works could be published under the aegis of the continuation of Lovecraft's deeply intricate world and mythology. The book is an insult, it demeans use even as liner for a parakeet cage."
4,Good safety glasses,"I've used these for years. Have used the clears, I/O mirrors, and full mirrors for work and motorcycle riding. I don't feel they scratch easily like others have said. But they ARE plastic. And they are available from many safety equipment suppliers for half the price. For $2.50-3.00 a-pair from them, I can afford to throw them away when they get a scratch."
4,Good Quality Safety Glasses - Recommended,"These Pyramex safety glasses are great when working with power tools around the house or at the range. The glasses are very comfortable and, most importantly, provides good eye protection even on the sides.Recommended!CFH"
3,WHITE LION LIVE,"This is the new white lion line up featuring original lead singer Mike Tramp and this is a live hits album featuring some of white lion's classics performed live.Many bands change band members all the time and we continue to follow them and in the end when its all said and done Mike Tramp is the voice of White Lion and truly is and always will be White Lion. Some people seem to get confused by the band name 'Tramp's White Lion' but the band is White Lion and the only reason why the alternate name was used was because of legal issues with former members but by the time 'Return of the Pride' was released in 2008 the band was once again known as ""White Lion""."
1,Yet another 80's band trying a come back,"Just what we needed a rehashed 80's band that only has 1/5 of the orginal lineup and then they release a best of album, but this time it's ""live"". What a joke. They just followed what Poison did and Axl did with G N' R, but at least the orginal lineup was there with Poison. Don't get me wrong I love 80's rock, but if you make a come back with the orginal name have the orginal line up or almost all it and new music too."
4,Listen & Learn & Love It!,"This book is almost worth it for the CD alone. I've listened to it many many times in my car. Oh yeah, and a great book comes with it! ;-) Lots of great bios along with the music in standard notation and tablature.Nola (Muriel Anderson) and the Star Island Jig (Harvey Reid) are my favorites, and the only two I've spent time learning so far. Harvey uses a partial capo on this - available from Shub, or from Third Hand Capo. Buster Jones is amazing, but I can't even imagine playing like that. Chris Proctor, John Miller, oh, and Tim Sparks ""Dance of the Sugar Plumb Faries"". Lots of great stuff in this!The only reason I say 4 instead of 5 stars is these folks are top of the line, so some of it is beyond my ability."
5,I really enjoyed this book and it was worth getting!!,"I had gotten this book for a class and had not heard of Mr. Swindoll at all. However, after receiving this book I now will definitely be sure to carefully apply this to my daily life. I enjoyed everything about it. The way that the author approaches each principle is great. I will surely use this as a part of my walk with God."
5,Excellent Job of Spiritual Guidance,"This is one of the best 'spiritual guidance' books I have ever read. I think because his thoughts and points of view were coming from his personal experiences, rather than what he thinks things should be like. I definitely look forward to reading another book by Swindoll."
4,Excellent resource on spiritual disciplines,"Readers of Charles Swindoll know what they're in for - a well-written, scripturally sound treatment of the subject at hand. This is, to my knowledge, the first time Swindoll has tackled spiritual disciplines, and he's as insightful as ever. Excellent review for mature Christians, and a good beginning text for those new to the faith."
3,Watch out for the glue on the labels!,"I received my set of two Chicago Metallic Commercial 16x14 cookie sheets from Cooking.com in record time. Unfortunately, both had large labels stuck on the cooking surfaces with large globs of some incredibly strong glue. Hot soapy water wouldn't touch it. Oil wouldn't budge it. Acetone didn't work. Paint thinner took some (but not all) of the glue off, at the expense of the surface. Cooking.com said they had no clue how to remove the glue. Finally, a customer service rep at Chicago Metallic (phone number provided by Cooking.com) offered to simply replace the cookie sheets. So...no, I haven't used them yet, because I haven't received the replacements. But I've already put quite a lot of time and effort into these items, so I surely hope they work well!"
5,Baking Sheet,This is the fourth baking sheet of this brand I have bought. It is perfect for baking cookies of any kind and Wonderful quality. Just rinse with hot water after baking and wipe dry. No greasing is ever needed. I love these.
5,amazing baking,"WOW, this pan lived up to its billing, plus, and continues to do so. It makes me look like I am professionl ! great results, eve browning, every time. Highly reccomend you give it a try if you are 'on the fence' about this pan."
2,spend a little more to get something nicer....,"I was surprised when I opened the package for this product -- it wasn't anything like how I'd imagined it. This cookie sheet is very flimsy and cheap feeling, almost like a one-time use product. Plus, everything sticks to it relentlessly. I'm not sure I'm going to get much use out of it, and I wish I'd spent a few dollars more to get something more substantial."
4,Not quite 'perfect' browning....,"This past Christmas, armed with every kitchen aid I could imagine, I baked several batches of Toll House chocolate chip cookies. I made sure the baking sheet was cold, that the oven was the correct temperature and that the dough was properly chilled. None-the-less, almost all the cookies were a little overdone on the bottom. I would still recommend this because there is nothing out there that is as affordable, quality produced in the USA, and as widely available.As I mentioned in my recent Matfer silicone/fiberglass baking sheet review, I will be using it to line this cookie sheet prior to baking a new batch of cookies. Will update with the results."
5,Cool Cookie Sheet,"This matched up with a Chicago Metallic cooling rack is a great combo. Our cookies really do come out better, and this pan never warps even though it is fairly thin. Bent edges make grabbing it with oven mitts very easy."
2,Very Disappointed,"When my cookie sheet arrived, it had a product label glued on with some sticky substance that was all over it. Getting the glue off has been a nightmare. It was sorta like hard rubber but didn't want to come off the cookie sheet. I've used everything I can think of to remove it from the cookie sheet. It's now scarred from Brillo pads and various implements to remove the glue. I guess somebody at the factory must've had a bad day or something and decided to plaster the glue everywhere. I won't be ordering anything from this company again."
1,Made in China,"I bought 3 of these pans, and while they are very high quality, I would rather spend just a little bit more and get the same pans made in the USA. These same Chicago Metallic pans are also sold at Williams-Sonoma, but the ones there are made in the USA rather than China. I have already purchased them and will be returning the ones that I bought at Amazon."
1,defective,"Never even got to try this item - it came with a label that was attached with glue that wouldn't come off the sheet. the more I tried to remove the glue, the more the metal sheet got damaged. I asked Amazon for a replacement which they sent and it happened again - TWICE. Both cookie sheets needed to be thrown out - what a waste."
1,There's a Reason This is Only $12,"With some products, you get what you pay for, and this is one of them.I think Wilton is overcharging at $12.This sheet is worth about $1.50.The edges are not finished, and so are unnecessarily and dangerously sharp.Not a good quality in something you have to handle a lot.I think this is where they got the price down to $12.The coloring is too light; a good cookie sheet needs a perfectly balanced finish color, dark enough to brown cookies, light enough to not scorch them, not too light so as to not provide any color to edges and bottoms.It's heavy, but that doesn't mean it's good; that just means it's heavy.It's not usable at this weight for this size.Save your money and your time, and get a decent cookie sheet at double the price.It will make every cookie experience a joy, instead of a headache and a guessing and hoping game."
3,Sharp edges,"I was surprised that the sheet is produced with edges that are blade-like considering its ""commercial"" moniker which I misinterpreted to mean heavy-duty and easy to work with. Taking it out of the oven is tricky when using any kind of mitt or oven pad. It's a fine sheet and probably fine for the initiated but definitely not a ""bake with you kids"" kind of product. It was pretty expensive even discounted."
1,Pans warp in 350 F oven,"I purchased two of these pans and both of them they started to warp within 5 minutes of being placed in a 350 F oven. The two opposite corners would warp up several inches causing an uneven baking surface. Once I take the pans out of the oven, the pans relax and are flat again.Terrible product as it is difficult to evenly cook anything when the pans fold so badly. I returned them to Amazon."
1,Too sharp for me,"Before I purchased this item, I saw it had mixed reviews. I inquired as to the country of origin for this cookie sheet. I wanted to make sure it was made in USA. I was told it WAS made in USA. When I got the item, I took it out of the box and I was stunned. The edges were so sharp that I could easily cut myself. This cookie sheet was made in China. I returned the item. Way too sharp for me."
5,good stuff,"these heads are very nice, the price from amazon was hard to beat. Very powerful currents the reverse flow could be a little stronger but i guess if it was it would suck up all my fish =)"
3,good,really made my tigers happy. they were jumping when i got it out of the box. i might even get a lion now.
5,My favorite brand,"The best hang on filters and one of the best power heads on the market.Unbeatable price and quality, real value for the money. My favorite brand."
4,Fishs,"My husband has a fish tank and he wanted this to add more current to the tank. It did and he was very pleased, the fish liked it as well."
4,"Very nice, with minor exception","I purchased this for a 55-gallon aquarium, to power an undergravel filter (to be used in combination with a Fluval 405). Overall, it's very nice, operates quietly, and I've had no problems with it.However, it is not that adjustable. You CAN adjust it using a slider control, but it doesn't change the flow rate all that much. You can also adjust the air intake, which is a nice feature. I have not used the reverse-flow feature, so cannot really comment on it, but I do fear that the intake might suck up smaller fish should I decide to do that, to reverse waterflow once in a while.It is well-made, and has a number of adjustments to fit it in position, which is nice. Overall I recommend this, but feel that the flow rate should be a bit more adjustable."
4,Powerhead works great!,I recently purchased this powerhead to help with circulation in the tank. We were getting that protein film on the top. So far this is a quit powerhead and really gets the water moving. I also purchased the AquaClear filter that attach to the powerhead and have even noticed a big difference in the clarity of the water. The only issue I have is with the attachment to hang on the side of the tank. It feels a little flimsy and feels like the powerhead is too heavy for it. I am currently using this method and have had no problems with it yet. I might switch to the suction cups that come with it though.
1,"For its price, it's noisy","I works, but considering the price it's noisy. I bought a much cheaper one and it's quieter."
3,Super sensitive and stiff at the same time,"It is really difficult to get the settings to have the speed/intensity of water to exact personal wants. I can only seem to get mine to either blast the fish out of the water, or just kinda sputter every other second for an uneven current. Its kinda hard on my halfbeak fry who need/want a current while they're growing. I imagine there are other powerheads that might be easier to set, but this one has been pretty difficult."
3,it's ok,i buy these every 6 months. it just doesnt last if you are running this 24/7. must have for fish tank.
4,A fun story arc,"This book collect the climactic issues from one of the ealiest storylines in Peter David's historic 11-year run on the book. While at first glance it seems like a standard adventure story, there are some great insights to the character of the Grey Hulk, who's very different from the green version averyone is familiar with. It also has many other good characterizations, and has a few historically significant moments in Hulk history. In short, it is well written. The art is done by a young(er) Todd McFarlane, at a time when he hadn't quite become famous, but was getting there fast. It shows a stylistic flair without becoming bogged down in style, a criticism often aimed at his later work. In summary, I like this collection quite much, as it shows the beginnings of two great careers in an above average adventure story."
4,Collects issues 340-346,"The Hulk I knew was green, angry and not so intelligent. This book was a suprise to me since Hulk was strong, grey and intelligent. Point is, he is no Avenger type of guy, more like someone nasty and mean.Some issues are unsung gems, like the one with man-bull and one with Betsy/Hulk dialogue. Story goes strong, although my fave Peter David's stories are X-Factor 70-90 or so.Tod McFarlane fans, what are u waiting for?"
5,One of the best and most iconic Hulk stories ever,"Written during the early height of Peter David unheralded run on the Incredible Hulk; Ground Zero stands as one of the best and most iconic Hulk stories ever. In this TPB, the Hulk is on a mission to stop the production of Gamma weapons, and his arch nemesis the Leader stands in his way along with some of his warriors. Everything about Ground Zero stands as classic Hulk: from the operatic action and superb dialogue to the David's vision of the Hulk himself. For newbies to the character, this is not the uncontrolable, green-skinned monster that we all know; instead, this is the grey-skinned, intelligent, and deadly weapon of destruction that is truly a force to be reckoned with. Not to mention that Ground Zero features wonderful art by a pre-Spawn (and even pre-Spider-Man) Todd MacFarlane, and you already know what you're getting here. Ground Zero stands tall as one of the best Hulk stories ever crafted."
1,Brainiac DVD Debut Disappointing,"Disappointing DVD transfer of the classic turkey, The Brainiac. Beverly Wilshire released this DVD in 2000 and it's too bad they just picked up any old copy and transferred it to the digital medium. The video is scratchy and there are several places where the audio skips. There is even an inexcusable long pause during a reel change. I guess you get what you pay for. Maybe someday one of the better companies will release The Brainiac in all its glory. Until then, we're stuck with this copy. Abel Salazar is turning over in his grave!"
5,"Great DVD, Great Classic","First of all I would like to mention the quality of the image and sound, is superb. This movie was made in 1962 and you will never notice that, what a great job doing the transfer.The Villian of the movie get's killed by fire when the movie starts and swears to come back and kill the descendants of those who took his life, and no he is not Freddy Krueger ;)Two hundred years later he comes back to fulfill his promise. Of course this time he can transform himself into a ""horrible"" monster, of course is a very cheesy one and it will make you laugh a lot, This classic has all the elements of a fun campy horror movie, cheesy monster and FX's, some bad acting, some not that bad acting and specially ""The Look"", you will understand it when you watch it :D"
3,"If you are into this genre, this is a MUST HAVE! (cheap too)","Well, it's cheap, cheesy, but a good laugh. I especially liked thescene with the big bowl of brains -- the ""good guy"" slurps a spoonful. I assume that since this movie was made in Spain that they are real brains (calves brains?) and not Jello. Yuck."
1,Deserves a ZERO for being dangerous. Here's why:,"After baking several pies, all three of the pie pans we bought began to flake off their ""nonstick"" finish! This product certainly lives up to its name: its nonstick finish doesn't stick. Instead, it ended up in our pies. Now its in our trash. Save your money and possibly your health and pass on this bad product."
4,Chicago Perforated Pie Pans,"These are just what I have been looking for, pie came out with perfect crust."
3,not a deep dish pie pan,"This is not a deep dish pie pan... maybe I didn't read the description very well, but it seems to be rather small. The kids are using it to heat up their pizza slices and rolls in the oven because the perforations allow quick warming. Make sure you pre-spray with pam because if you burn something in it, it does not clean very easily."
5,"Essential for Barrett, Browning fans",I have been a fan of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning for many years. This book brings their amazing love story to life. Absolutely loved it!!
4,hats off to kevin smith,"this was a great read! if you're looking for a funny swashbuckling adventure with some heavy dialogue...this is the book for you! it is pretty light hearted most of the way through, although it has some heavy adult and dark humor. the artwork is fun, although not what i consider classic. don't get me wrong, it's very visually appealing, especially colorwise, but it's a little cutesie. the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's not a huge sweeping classic that leaves you begging for more...but for what it is it is awesome. worthe the money."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Kevin Smith returns the Emerald Archer to life. A character that is a lot of fun, because he has a very different personality to lots of his counterparts, and hence clashes with them often.A flawed man in many respects, but still a hero, he is happily dead, until an old friend, now wielding great power, comes calling."
5,Epic Arrow Come To Life,"This is exceptionally written and executed book which resurrects one of DC's most lovable but overlooked characters. Green Arrow - ever a fan favourite - but never a major player is perhaps one of the most complex, interesting and human heroes to walk the DC landscape.Kudos to Kevin Smith and Phil Hester for taking a potentially complicated backstory (something that I feel DC tends to stumble badly in with other books) and making it very real and personal. But most of all, they pump new life - literally - into a dead character.Green Arrow's appeal is his vulnerability and the only other series that matches this level of writing is perhaps Daredevil - which Kevin Smith has also worked on. Both characters are similar.Having read a couple of other books in this series - this is probably the tour de force, striking a critical balance between heroic nostalgia and contemporary relevance in its story telling."
4,Right on Target,"Okay, the art takes some getting used to, and Kevin Smith has written better. That said, Green Arrow fans could not hope for a better resurrection. And it makes sense ... as much as anything can in DC's continuity.You've got Batman, Superman, Black Canary, and quite a few other surprises in these pages, but let's face it -- the draw is that liberal, womanizing Ollie. Smith doesn't forget that, either. GA may be back from the dead, but he hasn't changed a bit.If you've seen GA on ""Justice League Unlimited"" and wondered what he'd be like in his own book, this is a great place to start. Then go back and hunt down all the Green Lantern/Green Arrow stuff from the good ol' days. You'll be glad you did."
2,Green Arrow comic or JLA comic?,"I picked up this book at a Borders I flipped through and thought it would be a good one. The art is good But the story line is hard to grasp. To fully understand this book you need to know a lot about the history of the Dc universe. I thought it was cool at first but then it just became silly with the ""death"" of green arrow and his spirit in heaven."
4,Honda Headlight assembly,"The price was good for this item, although the handling charge was high. Still cost significantly less than a local purchase. The vendor shipped the assembly quickly, and it arrived within the specified time.The assembly installed without any problems, and has worked well since installation. The fit was not as precise as a Honda original part, but at a third of the cost of the OEM part, this assembly was a good buy. This is the second headlight assembly (deer!!) I've purchased from this vendor, and would certainly buy from them again."
5,Still thinking about this one years later!,I read this thriller many years ago when I could still stand to make myself scared silly. I still think about it sometimes! It was that gripping! I now just buy it for all my kid's friends who say they like scary books!
3,"Comments on ""The Cave""","Frankly, I was shocked by the descriptions of torture in this book. If you are disturbed by tales of physical torture, then I would not recommend this book. It is very graphic. I had never read anything like this before. And, I really don't want to read anything else like this again.But, once I started reading the book, I must admit that it was hard to put down. I wanted to know what was going to happen next and if the victim would survive.You would like to believe that people like this do not exist in the real world, but reading the newspaper and watching TV you are all too aware that they are out there.Larry E. MatthewsProfessional Geologist"
3,Not to the level of suspense I was expecting,"I'll admit it: I like a good scare! I was expecting to get a really good scare with this one, but alas, was somewhat disappointed. The set up was good, the imagery was great but the repetition of the main characters thoughts was a let down. How many times do I want to hear her ""head thoughts"" that are just the same words rearranged? Too, it was almost as if the author thought she had to explain the evil in depth so that we could understand how it was coming about. Instead, she should have allowed us to use our own intellect to ""see ahead"" into the mind of the monster in this novel. Imagination is a powerful monster in itself---I wished she had let us use our own."
4,Outstanding!,"Just when you thought is was safe to sleep with the lights out...... ""The Cave"" takes the reader down into the dark underground world beneath our feet and scares the hell out of you. If you like this book don't miss ""Tales of Dirt, Danger, and Darkness."""
4,Not Bad,"I just bought this television at Best Buy and I was impressed with the quality of the picture. The sound was what was bothering me so I'm taking it back. It sounded loud at the store, but when I got it home, I had to turn it up almost half way to get any volume out of it. Then, when you do that, it sounds really bad. Maybe if this T.V. was a little cheaper it wouldn't bother me as bad. I think its worth more like 225.00-250.00. Not 300.00. I thought there was going to be such a dramatic difference between flat screen and regular direct-view. There is a little, but not so much that its worth an extra 100.00. In all, the picture is fantastic, but if sound quality is a must for you, this is lacking that certain something."
4,Great buy,"This is the first flay screen TV I have purchsed, and the first Toshiba. I have always been a SONY fan but I have to admit this picture is as good as the SONY 20"" flat screen that I compared it to. The picture is extreamly sharp with very good contrast. The stereo sound is only fair, but that is probably to be expected with the small closely spaced speakers that come with televisions of this size. It has front video and rear video inputs, as well as rear component and s-video imputs to take advantage of the high quality picture that a DVD player produces. I don't think you'll be dissapointed with this one."
3,"Decent overview, not enough practical advice","My 10 week old won't nap, yet nowhere in this book can you find any help on how to get your baby to take naps. The all important ""Sleep Solution"" I'm looking for can't be found here."
5,A practical book with real solutions,"You're tired. The baby isn't sleeping properly and you need help NOW! That's why this book is great, because it gives you ideas you can try today, implement right now. And if the first idea doesn't work, there's often another one, too, sometimes a whole list of ideas.I like the fact that this book talks to real mothers about real sleep problems and gives real, practical solutions. Ann Douglas writes like your older sister or best friend would talk to you, gently and with humour."
2,Don't Buy!,"I thought this would be a good book since it represented more than one view. Basically all it does is repeat over and over there is no one right approach and don't beat yourself up, trust your gut. Heard that a lot, doesn't help with a 10 month old that has yet to sleep through the night. It took over 120 pages to get to the part that presented some ideas, but it doesn't really explain the various thoughts on how to get your child to sleep. I know there is not one answer, that's why I thought this book would be helpful, however, it wasn't. All the information presented could be found through an internet search. Very disappointed! I read many reviews before I bought the book, too bad they weren't accurate!"
4,sweet autobiography with some ritual,"This book is mainly a journal from several years of healing ceremonies, including her own many-year battle with cancer. It's fascinating now to glimpse the world of the native healer in the late 1970's to early 1980s. Evelyn is a beautiful writer with a grateful and peaceful way of describing her life and activities.While the book does include some information on Medicine Wheel rituals, it is mainly a lesson in peaceful and responsible living, and preparation for dying."
3,Children of sixties,The artist is similar to Procol Harum or Donovan.There is not a lot of rock on here. More folkythan rock-filled. You get a nice blast of whatthe sixties were about on this slab. The albumcould play and end before you would notice it.You have to pay attention and be knowledgeableabout music to appreciate Love & Poetry. I likeit for its obscurity and for tracks 14 and 15.They belong to a NUGGETS collection.
2,BEWARE KOREAN LP MINIATURE!!!!!,"The Korean Limited Edition LP Miniature doesn't have 21 songs, it has only 13 songs and the CD is the same 2004 re-issue from Green Tree (GTR 629). At least is 300 Limited Edition and gatefolded with a lot of information about the band."
5,Great book,"This book is full of information and very good pictures. If you are wanting to learn about herbs, this is a good book."
3,Nice color,"Nice materials (physically), do not expect a lot of details of the herbs. The color and pictures pleased me good for your coffee table."
2,Excellent reference,I took this out from the library and found that I HAD to own it. I do a lot of herbal remedies so I find that a quick reference is absolutely great to look up what I need and what ELSE an herb might be good for. This book has been very useful for this.
1,I agree this item is mislabeled!,"I did not read the comments before I ordered (lesson learned) - so I was fairly shocked when my pan arrived so see that it is a ""12 cup MINI popover pan."" Of course, I have the option of returning the item, but I would have to pay shipping. After waiting for over a week for my pan to arrive, I can't tell you how disappointed I am. MINI clearly didn't fit in with my popover plans! I will make a trip to Linens and Things or Target to find what I really want - so much for convenience!"
1,THIS IS A MINI PAN,BEWARE!! This is a MINI pan NOT a regular size pan.. The description SHOULD SAY THAT!! Too much of a pain to return..but NOT WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING!.
1,Poor description of web site.,I was looking for a full-size pop-over pan and the description didn't say it was a mini. Maybe some people would know that full sized pop-over pans don't come 12 pans but I deidn't. So I sent it back and bought one locally.Ed T
2,It looks like MINI is noted... let's talk spot weld,"I don't think it's fair to bust a product for a lack of keyword. My problem with the product is inadequate spot-welding. The cups began to separate from the frame not long after first use. I didn't give it 1-star for this flaw because the cups are still usable. However, I recognize inadequate product testing and inspection when I see it. Seriously, guys, how hard is it to spot weld properly? I'm a frigging computer programmer and I know how to spot weld."
1,Junk,Piece of garbage. Also not as advertised. Easier to through it out than return this piece of crap.Amazon usually gets the script correct but they sure missed this one. I will think twice before ordering through them again.NOT RECOMMENDED unless you just need the aggravation and a full trash can.
2,Not full size,"No where in the discription does it say this is a mini pan. I was very annoyed because I read and read making sure it was full sized. ""MISADVERTIZING!"". Pan is good quality and I will not pay for return shipping, but change the discription!!"
3,Another Pan ? Is this really needed ?,Start your recipe in a cold oven in your muffin pans and use the cupboard space for something else you can buy with your $$.
4,good popover pan,"This pan produces wonderful popovers that fall right out, not even a hint of sticking. It is the slickest bakeware I've ever owned. The only problem is the quality, one weld broke between the rod and the popover cup, but it still works great. Highly recommend. I'm going to check out other bakeware from Chicago Metallic, since Calphalon's nonstick line uses a new non-stick coating that is horrible. The original calphalon dark coating couldn't be beat, so I'm hoping I found a replacement in Chicago Metallic for all my non-stick bake ware."
5,YORKSHIRE PUDDING PAN,"IT MADE EXCELLANT YORKSHIRE PUDDING, I WAS USED TO USING A MUCH SMALLER ITEM, BUT I WAS ALWAYS SPILLING THE BATTER AND GREASE IN THE OVEN. NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS AT ALL AND THE YORKSHIRE WAS FANTASTIC."
5,Great Medium Sized Popover pan,"This is a nice size popover pan that ranges in the medium size. I have the large popover and the mini-popover pans and this medium size is great for entertaining.Someone rated this pan a 1-star because the description apparently didn't mention it is a medium pan and I don't agree. I have nothing to do with Amazon or this company, this is a very good buy and a 5-star product."
2,Beware of flaking paint and detached cups!,"I gave this pan to my mom as a gift about three years ago. It always worked fine until late last year. At that time the paint began flaking off into the popovers. About a month after that one of the cups broke off. It seems the only way to get the paint out is to cook something in it. She always used oil or cooking spray on the pan and didn't use a scrubber on it. (I used a scrubber to try remove the paint from the pan, she did not.) I think a pan, even a low price pan, should last a decade or more when its used less than seven times a year."
4,Decent entry level surround sound system,"This is a decent entry level unit. This surround sound system is o.k. with the satellite speakers I would recomend that you get some decent floor speakers and a different set of satellite surround speakers, and sell the ones it comes with. The satellite speakers that it comes with are sh.tty only the center channel is worth keeping. With the whole new speaker setup you get alot more power. The reciever with the new speaker setup gives you enough power to not even have a subwoofer.Any Philips package you get will be even nicer with floor speakers and different surround speakers. Subwoofer is not a necesity with powerful floorspeakers. Surprising power for a 5x60 watt reciever."
3,"A Heavy, Dense Book","This is a meaty, tough, serious book not to be read by the casual dilettante. It requires effort, sweat, devotion, and work. Having said that I am persuaded by Horsley's argument and found a new appreciation for the evangelist Mark. This is not an easy book and pastors, busy pastors, might not want to expend the effort needed in order to understand what the author intends. However, I found the devotion needed to work through the book more than paid rewards in appreciating both the author's knowledge and expertise, but also the gospel writer's abilities."
1,BEWARE!,This product caused severe allergic reactions in four dogs when used at the groomer. My two dogs were itching and bleeding from the skin after this product was used. We had to rinse them several times to remove and still it left scars from where it set in thier skin!This product should be recalled!
5,Fantastic!,I bought this to make french baguettes and it works wonderfully. The perforated wholes help cook the bread evenly and then you can simply drop it in the dishwasher for easy clean-up. I definately recommend this product.
5,baguette pan,"Chicago Metallic Professional Nonstick Perforated Baguette PanI love to make home baked bread. This pan helps to make the bread crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I make italian bread with it all the time. I have two of them and I can make 6 loaves and freeze them. Thanks Amazon, I looked in a lot of cooking and kitchen stores and could not find anything like this. Ann Philbeck, Providence Forge, VA"
5,"Makes Great, Crisp Baguettes","I make a lot of bruschetta, and find the bread I make in this pan to be perfectly sized for bite sized bruschetta, which are great for entertaining. The perforations allow the bread to develop a crisp, golden crust all over. As the Italian Food Host at BellaOnline, I make homemade bread on a weekly basis, and this pan is one of my favorites to use when bread baking."
5,baguette pan,We ordered this product from a recommendation of a friend. It works great with our bread machine dough. We'll never buy bread at the store again! Easy to use and easy to clean up.
1,Holes Make Removal of Bread Very Difficult,"I used these pans for years. The big problem is that the dough seeps into the tiny air holes and basically seals the bread in the pan at hundreds of tiny points. Too often I had to literally tear the bread out, leaving huge chunks of bread literally riveted to the pan. The only way to clean the holes is to poke them through the other side with a small pointed object, not a fun project. They have a ""non-stick silverstone coating"" which is useless. Even when slathering oil, I had tremendous sticking problems. I finally threw mine in the trash today after ruining 6 beautiful baguettes."
3,Handle with care!,Used once and item performed very well but after washing I noticed several scratches where it touched other items in the sink. I don't throw items into the sink and this was no exception but still it scratched way too easily. Now I need to reconsider where to keep it as I usually keep all my pans and the like together in one big drawer. This is clearly a problem in protecting the non-stick coating.
1,bread pans,This product did not even approach what was described. A bagutte pan needs to have a decent-sized curvature so a bagutte shape will be obtained. This pan would have produced a fairly flat loaf.
5,A must-have for bread bakers!,"I purchased this product about a year ago, when I was trying to make my own sub buns but couldn't quite get the height I wanted making them free-form. This is perfect for that! I get 6 large sub buns or 9 smaller ones. Nothing is better for your lunchmeat or chicken breasts than putting them on a fresh bun from your oven! I have since made the baguettes and use the pot of boiling water and spraying the inside of the oven mentioned in previous reviews, and they turn out wonderful! I have NEVER had a problem with the bread going thru the holes as mentioned previously, and all I do is spray lightly with Pam. This is a wonderful addition to the bread baker's kitchen and for the price you can't beat it."
4,Don't Use Too Much Dough,"Another excellent product by Chicago Metallic and a must if you bake baguettes - or want to. One warning, don't use more than 12 oz. of dough or it will overflow the sides and you will end up with one very odd shaped loaf."
4,Nice accesory for breadmaking,"It works as intended, helping to keep the shape of baguettes and allows even cooking. However, it is no substitute for good ingredients (mainly flour) and proper procedures.Henry"
4,Great video!,Pretty awesome quality video of Megadeth. Sound and picture quality are excellent. Megadeth in top form with Dave on Bass and Mustaine right on the money with vocals and guitar.
4,"Good concert, but...","Bluray audio and video quality is awesome. Megadeth and metal fans must buy this. However, performance wise, it is a bit lacking. The Warchest DVD (with menza and friedman) is the best Megadeth concert video, followed by Rude Awakening. The lead guitarist plays the solos flawlessly but he seems to be smiling throughout, so you can't ""feel"" the solo like when Marty played it. The bass drum is using trigger and is too loud, plus there is a lack of ""feel"" in the drums as well. Mustaine and Ellefson are the only one who are able to perform (though dave seems to be loosing his voice). Even with all these issues, it is still worth to buy in bluray. Because it is Megadeth."
3,"Great performance, terrible camera work, dubbed vocals?","Straight to the point: the performance was awesome. A truly great show. But the blu-ray/DVD is plagued with horrendous camera work. The camera is constantly panning, zooming, and switching from one to another. You never get to focus on anything. Even during the many guitar solos, you'd think the camera would stay on Broderick but instead you get to look at Ellefson from a side shot 15 rows back over the audience. Despite that glaring negative aspect, the video does look amazing in it's high definition form. As for the audio, everything is mixed very well I think despite other reviews that say otherwise. I have read, however, that Mustaine's vocals may have been dubbed. I didn't notice this until I read it and even still I'm not completely sure if it's true or not. If the vocals were dubbed, then that is definitely a shame."
2,Terrible sound... It has to be a mistake...,"I like Megadeth, even more because Mustaine has shown a new way of life. However this blu ray has a very bad audio. The 5.1 DTS is terrible, with too much VOICE sound on LEFT BACK speaker (what???). This is really annoying. And in general audio is only bass, nothing clear or cristal. The stereo track is ok."
3,Great Concert with Bad Audio,"I purhased this along with the 1 nite in Argentina DVD. As many have said, the audio mix is kind of funny. I have a Jamo HT top of the line with Reference monitors and the Kick and Bass are more prominent through the entire mix. I am surprised that the DVD passed such an important flaw. It sounds like a club mix than a live areana mix. The surround sound of the crowd is literally non existent. I would have given it 1 more star if not for the bad audio and another star for the pakaging.. For a 20th Anniversay DVD this was cheap."
3,"bad vocals, bad mixing, bad camera, good musicianship","this dvd was a dissapointment. The vocals were HORRIBLE(try to imagine Dave Mustaine singing without a tongue... seriously). The camerawork was too crazy, I wouldve liked camera work similar to rude awakening. The guitars were badly mixed, Daves guitar was much louder than brodericks.on the good side, the instrumentals were flawless, and broderick is a beast, though he doesnt seem to show any real emotion other than smiling and nodding during solos. Ellefson is a beast on the bass, his Five Magics performance was awesome.The only real reason worth buying this is to see the entire Rust in Peace album live, other than that, Id go with Rude Awakening or That One Night."
3,Ok but very little fun,I thoght this game is a dud. Most of the levels you can't come close to winning and other are a piece of cake. 3 stars is probably the best because the easy levels are sort of fun. I would highly recomend this game. If you think i'm lieing then you must think crazy. This game is not how good it looks like on the cover.
1,Complete Fluff,"I am only a few chapters in and the author has complete proven himself to be a fool. He poses as an Atheist convert and an Ordained Minister when he talks about the book of ""Revelations"" and points out all his ignorance and close-mindedness. Robert Blake is a classic Atheist, one who dismisses God because of Miracles rubbing against science and dismisses faith as ""Childish."" Don't hesitate to read it though, if you want to shake your head in disgust."
5,One additional comment!!!,in addition to my previous review!! one word of warning. if you sit close to tv and have volume at low levels there is an audible buzz i assume comes from the amplifier. i am about 8 feet away and it is no problem because volume is up enough to not notice. but if your set up or viewing preference is close to tv and low volume levels it could be annoying!! still rating this unit high because i have no issue here but you may.
1,disappointing,"I've heard Berlitz is widely recognized for language education.The exercises in this workbook are good challenges forpractising French. However I am disappointed to see theanswer key has several incorrect words, spellings and usage.Why provide answers if they're wrong?"
5,Powerfully Enlightning!,"Where do I begin......this book has been extremely informative. Specifically in regards to the ""public"" school system. I am a 31 year old single parent of an 11 year old boy. Recently I have been dealing with various issues within the public school system. It alarms me to know that the experiments to ""distruction"" of our black children still goes on. Moreso, how we continue to allow are children to be ""test cases"". We can no longer turn a ""blinds eye"" to our African American children (specifically boys) any longer. This book has encouraged me to continue to be a ""visible"" advocate for my son as well as other African American boys. It has compelled me to become more pro-active in my childs education. It is imperative that we as African Americans put an end to this ""Progressive Genocide"" in the school system. We can no longer afford to be complacent! I pray that you recieve the message this book has to offer. It is time we ""Rose"" to the occassion!"
4,Kill them before They Grow,"The book was right on, regarding the school systems and the teachers that work in it."
2,Should these rust?????,"Less than a year ago, I purchased two 9 x 9 Metallic pans. Already, one of them seems to be developing a spot of rust. Hard to believe that should be happening with a pan that is supposed to be so ""durable."""
5,Would recommend for all,These are some of the heaviest duty pans I've ever used. I bought it as a gift and wish I had ordered another for myself.
5,Great pans,"The pans are very sterdy and I love that they are dishwasher safe!! I used them this weekend and they worked excellent!! I needed a 9"" square pan for a wedding cake I was doing and it worked great!"
3,Small Media Bag,"Decent small media bag...the drawstrings are not worth using. I use a small cable tie instead. They don't hold much, but they are a good way to add fresh charcoal to my power filters. I rinse the main cartridge and then use them over and over till they cannot pass water easily. The bags keep a fresh supply of charcoal or ammo carb in the filter. I was using my wife's discarded panty hose and this was fine, but I decided to just buy some cheap bags. If I need more bags I will probably get a larger size with a (hopefully) more manageable closure."
5,"Bought it, Read it, & Loved It; Can't Wait for the Sequel!!!","I bought the book over the Internet, read it, and loved it, and I can't wait for the sequel. This author writes about the ordinary and brings it to life. She takes a small town/city and turns it into high interest. She puts you right in the heart of Strawberry Town with her, and she makes you care. This is a Southern literary memoir set in Louisiana, and I didn't want to put it down until I completed it. It is a page turner that will move the reader emotionally and make you cry as well as laugh. So, get ready to cry with Magnolia, but don't worry she'll cheer you up again as you laugh at the eposides she gets herself and her sister into. A light, easy read you'll enjoy that will take you back to a time when life was simpler and much cheaper. Don't miss this should-be classic piece of literature."
3,"OK, I'm a Geek","Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Buffy. But this season just seemed a little forced. Once they left HS, it seemed like they struggled with the writing and story lines. Probably a result of moving it to the WB. But, (without spoiling anything) - the last episode really does rock!"
2,Lacking the Greatness of the Former Seasons...,"Now, I just recently got into Buffy, and I have to say I'm thoroughly disappointed with the 7th season. I miss the focus on our main three characters, and thought that should have been the point, especially in the last season, but no, the entire focus was shifted to the Potentials, who, by the way, bored me to death. I mean, don't you think this should have been brought up AGES ago, if it was going to be this significant in the final season? Urgh. It's like the final season is a whole new show, one I don't really care for. Nothing happens. Everyone's character is twisted, and nothing like themselves. Everything was just done wrong.I'm still going to read the season eight comics, just to see if those improve, and I'm really hoping they do, because this was just cringe-worthy."
3,"Don't like it as much as previous seasons, but...","Buffy has been my favorite show since I first caught it on TV in the middle of season 3. I don't like the final season as much as the previous ones, mainly because Buffy/Spike seems to be the only ones getting screen time, and Xander/Willow/Giles became sort of like special guests. Also, I kept waiting for some big surprise and climax in the final episodes, which in my opinion never materialized. On the other hand, that I don't like it as much doesn't mean it's a worse season than the other ones. Maybe I just don't like growing up..."
4,Potential unmet.,A must have for all Buffy fans but still feels rushed. Can you really say that they planned to end the show before the season began? It was obviously decided after the some episodes were shot. That is the only way to explain the plot points that were dropped. We begin the season like Dawn at the rebuilt Sunnydale High is going to be integral only to never see much of her again after a certain point in the series.Spike still carries the show but instead of going down the path of originality they recycle Angel's storyline in season 7. James Marsters is still a great actor and carries his part while doing his duty.A very interesting villian and sidekick help give the season some good moments but overall it feels rushed.Top 3 eps.Beneath MeConversations with Dead People.Lies my Parents Told Me.
4,"Soul, Love and a Champion","This season isn't the best there is, but it's still awesome. After season 3 and 5, it might be the most gripfilling season of the show. The dev. of some characters (Anya, Spike, Dawn, Andrew and Buffy) are really shown, especially with such great actors as Emma Caulfield and James Marsters. Bringing in DB Woodside from the woodwork was a great idea as the ""guy you don't like"", and the whole B/S storyline makes tears brim viewers eyes in almost every last 5 eps (especially in End of Days and Chosen). Storyteller is most probably the funniest ep of all time, and you also have the drama you might itch in such eps (Beneath you, Lies my parents told me, etc...). Also, last note, bringing back one of the coolest characters in Faith was pure genius. Kudos to Joss."
3,"Not the Best Buffy Season, but still good!","""Going back to the beginning"" was the theme for this, the seventh, and final season of Buffy on television. And, while there were bright points of greatness (""Conversations with Dead People"" and ""Chosen"" are well-paced and nicely done), this final season should have had better, more cohesive character arcs. Instead, all we got were somewhat disjointed stories, inconsistent character-writing and never-realised ideas.Don't get me wrong, though, a bad episode of Buffy is still higher quality than standard television fare.While watching this DVD set, though, it seems the episodic nature of the season-long arc doesn't feel as drawn out as it did when it was aired, probably because there would conceivably be no long gaps between episodes."
1,Bad season... great show,"Season 7 of Buffy is pretty crappy. Even the season closer, ""Chosen"", pales in comparison to the ending for season 5 (IMHO). Seasons 1-5 of Buffy are THE best t.v. I've ever seen. The funny thing is... the show actually ended at the end of season 5. It had a great ending too. Why did they bring it back? Even Buffy was mad she was brought back to life, as part of the plot in season 6. I couldn't blame here; I was mad too.Season 6 is worth purchasing just for the excellent ""Once more with feeling"". There is nothing to recommend about season 7."
3,A must watch for all paranormal lovers,"I came to the show Buffy the Vampire Slayer late, actually well after it was canceled. I watched seasons 1-3 over a two week period and was blown away by how great it was, but slowly but surely seasons 4-7 got weaker and weaker as I watched. I still love the show, but I can see why it was canceled now. RIP."
1,Great disappointment,"You won't find a bigger Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan than me. I absolutely adore the show and I adore Buffy Summers above all. The seventh season completely destroyed everything she was, every positive aspect of her personality, and all the other characters and their relationships to boot. It wasn't Buffy anymore, and it was so painful to watch. Buy this set to complete your collection, but chances are you won't be breaking it out to watch any time soon. Joss knows I haven't. The writers were burnt and it showed even more here than it did in the sixth season. If you want to see why people spend day in and day out reading and writing about these characters, check out seasons 1 through 5 and you'll understand; watching the final two seasons will leave you puzzled, without a doubt."
4,A bittersweet end,"**some spoilers*It wasn't my favorite season but it was a good ending! Very emotional. It's nice to see how all the characters developed. Loved that Angel,Faith and Joyce had a final appearances. I miss the show! So every two years or so I can have my Buffy marathon! Thank god for DVDs. I also enjoyed the special features on disc 6 (Buffy wraps party, Joss Whedon's 10 most favorite episodes, etc)."
4,A landmark TV show comes to a close,"The last season and one last chance for a fun episode which has very little to do with the overall plot of the season. That would be ""Him"", about a high school boy wearing a magic letterman's jacket which causes any girl to fall under a love spell with him, while Percy Faith's ""Theme from `A Summer's Place'"" plays in the background. The ""him"" is played by Thad Luckinbill (""8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter"", ""The Young and The Restless""). Willow turns into Warren in ""The Killer In Me"" and nearly re-creates the shocking ending of ""Seeing Red"" (from Season 6). ""The Killer In Me"" provides the only way we could ever get to see ""Warren"" being sorrowful for what he did. A landmark TV show that gave us a variety of horror, comedy, soap opera and even a musical, one that gave us fictional monsters and real emotions, comes to a close in ""The Chosen""."
5,"Not a stellar SEASON, but rated high for content!","Well, I have to say, as a Buffy addict from day one, that this season is not my favorite. I understand what Joss and Co. were trying to do with this season, and of course, I have to respect that since Joss is a GENIUS, but this season for me was pretty dull up until the final 2 episodes. I thought it moved slowly, and that there was a lot of unnessecary repetition as far as establishing what The First is, slayer mythology, etc.HOWEVER, I gave this season on DVD a 5 star rating because of the content. The commentaries are great, and I love that they included wrap footage as well as a tribute to Buffy fans. I did, however, think they should have tried harder to get an interview or at least one commentary with SMG, since she has not been in any Buffy-related press since back when Season 1 was airing.So anyway, great content, ok season."
1,Slim Poor Quality,"I didn't like this product, I think that it has a very poor quality, its definitly not a good product. The episodes are amazing, but the product itself wasn't well manufactured."
1,Do not slim,Do not get the slim sets anymore because they repackage them so that is why they are cheaper. Now they are just a stupid normal DVD case and not a regular slim set.
4,Bittersweet end for Buffy,"I've gotta say it, because I know you're thinking it. It's not as good as what came before it, but season 7 is a must-have for the completist. There were definitely high points, such as ""Lies my Parents Told Me."" I look forward to seeing this show in a much higher quality than the poor broadcast signal I got on CBS (they played UPN programming in the afternoons). The special features, no doubt, will offer the most complete summary of the series so far. I look forward to Joss' commentary on this season that saw Buffy emerging as a strong individual who at once needs her friends but stands alone. I couldn't stand the ""slayers in training,"" but maybe they appealed to the younger set. All in all, it's a worthy buy, and a steal at Amazon.com."
5,7 Years of Excellence,"First of all, every review I saw on the first page said that Iyari Limon (Kennedy) was a bad choice of actress and a bad character, I completely DISAGREE! Iyari Limon is an amazing actress and from what I know, a pretty spiffy person.Secondly, EVERYONE else affiliated with Buffy the Vampire Slayer are great people, they're geniouses and gods/goddesses in my mind.And last but not least, season 7 is awesome. All of the episodes are wonderful and the extras that are on the DVD are cool. I love how they have the cast and crew answer certain questions (i.e. season 6's job questionnaire). That's all I've got to say for now. BUY THE SET!! You'll adore it!"
3,Series Winding Down?,"Apparently, they realized that Sara Michelle Gellar was getting too old for this role. They seemed to run out of story line with Xander's character. Willow's addiction to the dark arts was a plus, because after so many season's of ""miss goody two shoes"", I was ready for the darker side of Willow. Buffy, however, was no longer the cute, sassy slayer, and the whole Spike story line...... let's not even go there (Buffy's love sick lap dog!); I miss the Spike of old who forged 2 slayers, or was it three?"
1,"Season is great, too bad that the set is completely ruined.","I recently purchased all the Buffy seasons. In order to avoid paying over a hundred dollars I purchased the seasons used. Usually I do this and everything turns out fine, in fact all 6 other seasons are in pristine condition. Season 7 came to me water damaged, with food spills and so many scratches it would take years to count. Very disappointed, most likely will never order anything used again. I guess it serves me right for not seeing the actual product before buying. Moral of the story, don't buy used. EVER."
4,great ending to a fantastic show,"Although this season wasn't the best, it certainly is high in the ranks. This season takes a full circle and brings back most of the crucial characters from the past six seasons. But, they did miss one important person. All through the season the villian morphs into past and present characters that have died, but they never mentioned or showed a version of Kendra, the first slayer to replace Buffy. All in all, this was a good way to end the series. There were just a few things that could have been done better, or at least different."
2,Buffy Should Have Ended with Season 6,"I have always been a huge Buffy fan up until the 7th season. I could barely stand to watch the Buffy/Slayer wanna be's and Spike torturning himself over his returned soul. I am a huge fan of Spike and would rather him go souless and retain his character's great, quirkey and sexy personality. Besides, Buffy never knew she had it so good with Spike. Who needs Angel. Season 7 was a huge disappointment with the actors walking through their parts. Josh really let his loyal watcher's (no pun intended) down."
3,Buffy's Worst Is Way Better Than Angel's Worst!,"Season 7 is definitely the worst season of Buffy but in hindsight it's way better then season 4 the worst season of Angel.The only real problem with season 7 of Buffy is that some of the acting from the whingebag potential slayers was absolutely dreadful and the big bads weren't as good as previous big bads but this season does have some good episodes and the acting from the main cast like Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, James Marsters and others is as great as always!"
3,Starting to show signs of age,"Sadly, my favorite TV show was starting to show some wear and tear by this point. It was still brilliant and great and all that other stuff, but it lacked in a few areas. Mainly, Spike just wasn't as believable as he had been and I never bought his thing with Buffy.And the writing was a little weird in places."
3,Weakest Season But Better Than Any Average Season of a Network Primetime Show!,"This is a great show. Season Seven is the weakest season but with that said is still better than any season of any common network primetime TV show!I can't believe the previous reviewer hates this show just becasue Willow is a lesbain.As a straight reviewer who liked Willow's relationship with boyfriend Oz before she decided she was gay I really don't have a problem with Willow being gay and I think the homophobes need to get over it!Anyway, I liked Willow's first girlfriend Tara (seasons 4 -6 but I didn't like her second girlfriend Kennedy who Willow hooked up with in this final season Seven. Tara was so sweet and Kennedy had an annoying abrasive personality!"
3,What do you expect?,"If you expect the brilliance of the first 3 seasons (and the occasional episode thereafter), you're not going to find it here. Season 7 is a good (but not great) conclusion to the best television show that wasn't 'Twin Peaks'.That said, if you made it through seasons 4-5 (which had the worst story arcs), you'll probably enjoy watching this. The primary story arc is strong (read other reviews for details). Spike is still a great character. Riley is finally gone.But the wittiness is gone--I know, I know--the characters matured. Spare me--it was the cadence of the conversations that made Buffy what it is. The show thrived because of the peculiar relationships between the ancillary characters like Cordelia, Oz, Angel, Drusilla, Faith, the Mayor and Ethan Rayne. With new characters came new interactions, and I just don't think they measured up.That said, there were some fantastic episodes in the last two seasons, and if you were a fan of the show, you ought to see how it all ended up."
5,Going Out On Top,"The last two or three seasons of BtVS came in for more than a bit of fan criticism, primarily because some fans refused to grow with the characters and the series. It's not that the show *always* made the best decisions, but for television, they did extraordinarily well and they generally stuck to the primary themes which made the show great. The show continued to create new characters and plot lines that expanded and enhanced the original vision. This season and the 6th were an overt challenge to viewers and in the 7th, the producers had to decide to wrap things up. As the show developed over the years, boogey-man physical villians became the villiany of power, the challenge of simply living, and the existence of evil itself. On each occasion, the writers were true to the show's roots and in this final season, it leads to a finale which left me crying and cheering, and asking one of the questions the show has always been asking in different ways: ""Are you ready to be strong?"""
2,Love Buffy but hate dvds that dont work properly,The last disc in the season dosent work right which is a bummer since its the end of the show & you dont get to see it all.
3,Eeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...............................,"So season seven wasn't an amazing testament to Joss Whedon's creativity.However, it's not the worst show you could watch, and the funniest filler episode is on disc 3 or 4."
4,I LOVE IT SOOOO FUNNY,"If you have watched Buffy from the begining, or if you have just caught a few of the reruns, you will love this season. Past lovers will find that there is quite a bit of humor about past seasons. New comers will find the humor of the show just as funny as it has been over the years. Those writers are amazing! Anyways, i recomend you get this season almost as much as a recomend you get season six. SPIKE AND BUFFY FOREVER MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Thank You, Joss!",This is one of the BEST TV shows ever! I own all the DVD box sets and will finish the collection with Season 7. Thank you Joss for one heck of a show!!!
4,BUFFY-SEASON 7-REVIEW,Length:: 0:21 MinsBuffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season (Slim Set)
4,Not the Best Season but has it's Moments!,"Okay this wasn't the best season of Buffy and the potential slayers were obnoxious and took away from the core group and the First was a boring villain but I think Caleb was very creepy and a much better villain and I liked the acting by SMG and James Marsters and Marsters along with Anthony Stewart Head, Nicholas Brenden and the guy who played Principal Gibb were some great eye candy for the female fans of this show! So sad that this was the final season but at least it can live on forever on DVD and syndicated TV reruns!"
5,Sad to see it go,"The plots are great. More and more you start to see the nontraditional Buffy plots. This variation gives it a little more flavor to pull it through the season.I couldn't help but watch the whole season in less than two weeks.With all the evil you think ""well this is the big test"". And somewhere in the back of your mind you wonder if, being the last season, the character is going to die or not. Or who will die. Or what will become of everything.And as viewers, you won't even know until that last five minute segment.More Spike too!"
5,Buffy Ends,"An excellent end for the best series on television. Although the soon-to-be removed crutch that we still had Angel to hang on to made it easier to let go, its passing was nevertheless difficult to bear. The most imaginative series on television marked and highlighted real issues in demon form throughout high school, into college and beyond. Certainly not without missteps along the way it still always braved ahead and we were able to take courage as our own person fears took evil shape and were slayed. If it had to leave us alone in the dark it went out as a show worth remembering."
4,Buffy 7th season,"Although I feel this wasn't one of the best seasons of Buffy it still brought heart and soul to the characters that we have grown to love these past 7 years. I feel that this show although ""medieocre"" to some was still the best on television to date. So Hurrah to Joss for giving us seven of the classiest,well written,well acted out shows on television."
5,The Box is a Horrible Picture,"Okay, the season itself was great! But who wants to see the horrible sixth season picture...again! The pictures were horrible,they should've had Buffy and Willow, I know SPike's a main character, but it should end the way it started, which the series itself did. The box though is a total throw off, and doesn't nearly show the beauty of sarah michelle gellar. They should've cut a picture from an episode, and putit on the cover, as they did with faith's picture on the season three box. As stupid as u think this is, i feel strongly about it. And by the way, buy the dvd. It's one of the seven best tv seasons to watch. You will not be able to take ur eyes off of it."
2,Worst Season,"This season was terrible, i love the show, but this was pathetic. Stick with seasons 1-5"
1,Never should have been made,"Godawful tripe.If Season 6 of Buffy did not convince you that Joss Whedon is past his prime, then this will convince you that he is already a has-been.Once good actors are reduced to phoning in their parts. SMG and AH look like they would rather be anywhere else. And since when did show become all about Spike?This was the lowest rated, most critically panned of all the seasons. Easy to see why, the writing is inept, and too much focus is placed on nobodies like Spike and Andrew, not to mention a house full of redshirt potentials that Whedon seems to enjoy killing with the glee of school boy around an ant hill.Save you money. Save your time."
3,Semi Good and Bad,"There are ALOT of good points in this season that clears alot of things up. OKay now i'm not saying they were great, but the did get the point across. A really good episode is when Faith first arrives. If your a big fan, watch Angel season 4. GREAT EPISODES. Also, if you want to buy the ""Chosen"" books, go ahead....they're not TOO bad. Just, alot of mistakes and contradictions. For instance in the first chapter, buffy says to dawn,""That's okay, I missed the heart my first time too."" then she thinks,""Just a little white lie"".....SHE Did miss the heart. You can see this in Season 2 Becoming Part one, where angel 1st sees buffy."
3,Not the best season by far...,"...but still enjoyable! The gang throwing Buffy out, epsiodes that seemed to star Andrew and Dawn's whining, and an incorporeal villain, all make this season less than stellar. However, there were redeeming parts such as the return of Faith. Definitely recommended for rabid fans and completists, but others may not feel the need.If you're craving more vampires since Angel and Buffy went off the air--try FOREVER KNIGHT, starring a vampire cop searching for redemption--yes, they did it first!"
2,Bad Ending!!!!!!,"God, I was so disappointed with this show's ending!!!!!! Here they are fighting the ""first"" but then you never even see the ""first"" in person!!!! Why is that?!!!!!! I was hoping Buffy would fight a big ugly thing in the last episode but it's just a battle with all those vampire demons, and no ""first"".Plus I don't know what those potential slayers were all about. That made no sense to me at all. Another thing I could never tolerate was Willow. I hate her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She's real annoying, and she's a lesbian for god's sake. That time I saw her make out with that other lesbian I almost had to vomit. I started watching the show many weeks later to get my mind off that hideous scene but then I saw them make out again!!!!!!!!!! I almost kicked my TV screen in!!!!!!!! Oh well, that must be the work of the devil getting into Joss Weddon's mind and giving him that aweful idea like that. Anyway, I just wish there was more to the ending, like an actual ""first""."
5,It ended way to soon~,"Buffy, Season 7 was not a lot of viewers favorite. I have to tell you I thought it was a fascinating final Season, although the last episode cut the end Series Finale to short, but regardless of the poor reviews you may read about this season, this is a PHENOMAL Series Ending Season."
2,watch it while reading a magazine,"i watched it because i had to finish the series. this season was hard to get through. i didn't care about the potential slayer plotline or the rest of the nothing that made up the bulk of this season. there's like a huge streak of crap episodes in the middle. i thought at any second the bored-looking actors were going to look at the camera, throw their hands up and say, ""i give up!"" i did like the finale though. buffy, overall, is an excellent show. seasons 2 and 5 are the best. i just like to pretend this season doesn't exist. seacrest out."
1,Season 7 Sucked - Serious Lack of Story,"Where's the story? There is none, and that's the main flaw. We learn in episodes 1-2 that there's a ""First Evil"" for Buffy to defeat. Then almost nothing happens until episode 22. It's like season 7 = A BIG NOTHING = a real drudge to watch. ======================= Myself, I prefer the superior seasons 2 through 6, and I recommend you spend your money on those first."
1,Should've bought Weather-Tech,"These are made of cheap hard plastic but worst of all they refuse to stay where they belong. I thought the Husky liners were just a less expensive alternative to Weather-tech, WRONG! You get what you pay for I guess."
3,Great concept but mine didn't last for long.,"I was surprised by how hard it is to find a device that can interpret a variety of ring patterns. Unfortunately, as noted above, mine didn't stay working.I hesitated when first buying because the price is fairly high. For that reason, I was surprised to find the company using a cheap Dymo-label on the front. It fell off shortly before the product broke."
5,a good choice,"This book is a great place to start when looking at art theory, thought and a small smattering of philosophy. The works chosen are well thought out, good length and generally have good food for thought."
1,A cheap printing of a fraction of the work,"This is a lousy edition by some New York bandit publisher, pages misaligned, uneven print; contains many of the soppy poems and not all the better ones. Better off looking for an older, used edition."
5,Outstanding resource for Advance Practice Nurses,"This is the best Physical Assessment book since Bates. I would recommend this book to all Nurse Practitioners. It is definitely an asset, and a wonderful source of current information. It also suggests implications for the culturally diversed patient."
3,It's painless but not practical,"This product does exactly what is says. I had a pain free experience with the product, and it's quick and easy to use.That's not the problem I have. After using the product, I got red bumps that lasted for 2 days. Then, just 11 days after using it, I got red bumps again when some of the hairs start to reappear. Note, not all of them are reappearing yet. And, once they all have reappeared, I have to wait for them to get to 1/4"" to use the product again. I estimate that will take about 2 weeks, since human hair usually grows 1/2"" per month. So, best case scenario, I can sugar wax with this every 25 days, but of those 25 days only 9 days would I be without hair or red bumps. Note that this scenario is probably not different than it would be for waxing, and I would prefer this to waxing if it was the only other option, but I don't think I""ll be using this again."
5,great,"This was a gift for my wife, and just to see her face light up when she opened it was delight enough for me to love it,"
3,Premise Hard to Swallow...,"With futuristic or paranormal movies the viewer can accept just about any premise and any turn of events, but won't beable to with a human drama such as this one. The hospital premise is just hard to believe; in fact, almost immediately wenotice that it is so absurd that we start thinking it is just an artificial setup for something else. The second plot failure occurs when thefather's boss pays for the father's defense after he gets in serious trouble. How convenient, but I won't say why. And the third plotweakness is the father's holiness, in spite of what he has done. Acting is great, but the supposedly moral issues involved are not reallyelaborated so we are constantly asking: ""Yes, but..."" I would not recommend this movie which wastes the real talent brought on board."
5,Great perfume !,"I simply love this perfume, as well as people around me. Many times people have complimented me on the way i smell or asked me what i'm wearing. I think also that the bottle is beautiful and original. I would definitely recommend Contradiction to anyone who's looking for some new, nice fragrance or still debating whether to get it or not. Buy this one and you'll not regret :)"
1,Shipping Box Oversized,"GOOD PRODUCT BUT BAD SHIPPING PRACTICE.This is a great parfum for women, I gave it to my wife as a gift 2 Years ago and she just loves it and keeps asking for more. I ordered it from amazon for the first time, and this is going to be the last time I will order it from amazon though, as it was shipped in a box about six (6) times the original parfume box size,which is 2"" X 2"" X 5"". Because of this,it costed me lots of money for the freight as the final destination was not in the USA. The box came with enough paper stuffed in it to fill a one and a half gallon bucket.Sorry, but I think that amount of packaging was not called for."
5,bueno,"buenisimo esre perfume la atención fue muy buena, el tiempo estimado para la llegada del mismo fue el indicado rapido"
5,Contradiction By Calvin Klein For Women Eau De Parfum Spray,I bought this for my daughter as she loves this perfume. I rather like it myself the men's cologne is also very nice.Thank you
3,I am not convinced,"no me convence, no creo que sea el perfume original, huele distinto a los que compre anteriormente del mismo perfume. No me gustan las imitaciones."
3,Contradiction Parfum by Calvin klein,It seems like the parfum wears off on me right of way! i'm disappointed with it. the scent doesn't stay with you that long. i did noticed when i shopped around for it. CHEAP prices AFFORDABLE! for anyone to buy. maybe that's why? it wears off right of way. and i haven't had any complements on it too. :(
4,A solid cookie sheet,"I've been using this pan for a few months now. I baught it to try out the manufacturer. It's a good pan, and I'll buy from Chicago Metallic again, but it's not quite the uber-pan that some reviewers seem to have stated.It will come out of shape, in this case just over 400F. It pops back into shape as soon as it's cooled (I've never heated it over about 450F). You can lower the baking temperature on cookies, but it makes no real difference for (for example) garlic bread. In fact, I relocated my baking rack to take account of the higher heat transfer of the pan.Beyond that, it does what any quality pan should do. Holds cooking food and cleans up easily."
4,Good solid cookie sheet,"I really do like this cookie sheet. It is very solid, no flexing. The non-stick surface works great. I only rated it four stars because just rubbing against something else in my cabinet scratched the surface. I wish 4 1/2 stars was an option. Make sure you only use plastic utensils. Really, this the best cookie sheet I have ever used."
5,this is what christy moore is all about,"if you ever had the priviledge of seeing Christy perform live, you will know that his albums don't come better than this. Christy doesn't need a band, he is one all by himself (although you might only see him play the bodhran and the guitar). LATP gives a perfect example of what Christy is all about: the ballads, the humour, the wit, the terror, the story-teller. Highlights: the intro to ""Fairytale of New York"" and revised versions of ""Delirium Tremens"" & ""The Knock Song""."
5,Great CD,This is one of Christy Moore's best CD performances. It was done before a live audience in Dublin and the excitement of the live performance shows throughout the CD. One of his best alltime performances.
5,wow!,Christy Moore is brilliant. So is this particular cd. I would heartily recommend it to anyone. Rush right out and buy yourself a copy this minute. Peace.
5,Testament of Devotion,Thank you for the prompt service in getting the book to me and the good packaging. I would use this service again in ordering a book.
5,A Thing of Beauty,"Call it a ""classic"" if you like, but to me, this book is a thing of beauty. There are few books that compare to it.I once gave it as a graduation gift to a seminary student. She later commented that there were lots of things she agreed with. What?! There is no agrument or proposition here! You let it take you, lead you places. You immerse, wrap yourself in its beauty.The 1941 edition with an intro/bio by Douglas Steere (also reprinted in 70s or 80s) is MUCH MUCH preferred to the Richard Foster edition. He not only adds his own intro, but does editing of the original. Blasphemy. Skip his ""version"" and find an original."
5,Simple Devotion,"As I read this book, I thought, ""This man had a lifetime of learning to live, think, breath and walk in the presence of God."" However, at the end of the book, in the biographical section, I learned that Kelly really only began to live the life he describes the last few years of his life. It was not that it took him that long to achieve such spiritual levels, but rather, he apparently was busy with life and never tried.I found this encouraging--that a life filled with God's presence does not have to take decades to find. Rather, it can begin to be experienced little by little day to day and in a relatively brief time, moment by moment as Kelly describes.This is a great book. Kelly is not pretentious in any way. He plainly and simply gives clues of how to live a Christ-filled life in today's busy society."
1,Who do I complain to?,"The DVD transfer has been done at the wrong speed. The dialogue doesn't suffer too much, but the songs are slow and, consequently, at the wrong pitch.I recommend that you don't buy this DVD set. I'm returning my copy."
