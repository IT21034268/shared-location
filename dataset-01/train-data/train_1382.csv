3,Good not great,"If you are thinking about this knife, take a look at the tojiro line first. This is the same steel offered at a quarter of the price. The Damascus pattern looks nice, but looks are not important when it comes to tools. Also, the warrantee policy on these knives is all but nonixestent when it comes to shun."
5,Outstanding,"Shun makes the best kitchen knives I have ever owned, bar none. While I have a set of twelve, this is the one I use the most. They all come with a razor sharp edge right out of the box and are easy to re-hone with just a few strokes on a steel (well worth purchasing to accompany this knife). The damascus pattern, scalloped edge, and perfectly crafted profile chop through darn near anything (food-like anyway) with ease. I strongly recommend using a quality hardwood or bamboo chopping board to protect your investment. Courion or other hard substances are much harder on the blade edge; you'll have to resharpen it much more often.The weight and balance of this santoku knife are perfect. It is designed for right-handed chefs with an ergonomic d-shaped handle that won't twist or slip in your hand. There is a leftie version available too. My favorite kitchen knife; very highly recommended!"
2,Blade chips easily,"This knife is very sharp and holds an edge reasonably well. Japanese-style blades really do cut more sharply than western-style ones; this one was a pleasure to work with. However, the steel used for this blade chips very easily. I've had this knife for about two years and at this point it's pretty much beyond saving. I've had it professionally re-sharpened several times, but it has chips up and down the edge of the blade. I baby my knives (a half dozen Henkels, a couple of Wusthofs, and one Global) and this is the only knife I've had this problem with.If you're on the market for this style knife look instead at Global."
5,Hard to beat a Shun,"It's art and it's sharp. It'll cut tomato as thin as a piece of paper. That's true with all the Shun knives in my collection. This one takes an ancient art, combined with a modern form. A great knife and a joy to use.When you get a Shun knife, you should already know how to use and maintain knives. Shun edges are hard and thin, at 16 degree. It's for cutting soft objects, not frozen chicken."
5,nana,Excellent knife. Fits your hand for comfort and great size for lots of prep work! I have had other knives but have found that the Shun knives are the best. They remain sharp if properly maintained. They are easy to clean and maintain. Would highly recommend this knife.
5,Perfect all-round kitchen utility knife,"PROS: Excellent edge. Great weight and in the right places. Classic design.CONS: Use only on a wooden chopping block (you could very easily damage edge otherwise). Special needs sharpening.NOTES: You're gonna have to relearn the way you chop if you are used to using the tip as a pivot (this knife is very effective in a direct down chop and from heal to tip).As always, Amazon experience flawless."
1,Got rusty after using 3 month. It was sold by Amazon.com LLC,"Huge disappointment.Purchased this, Shun 7-Inch Santoku Knife on May 27,2012, and it was sold by Amazon.com LLCThis knife has been used only for normal house cooking.Also, it has been treated very carefully, because $160 was not cheap price for a house cooking knife.However, got rusty everywhere on the knife after using 3 month.Please check below linked picture.[...]"
5,Great Knife,Best knife I have ever used by a mile. Well weighted and super sharp. Also great looking with excellent blade life.
4,Nice knife.,This is a beautiful knife. It was very sharp new and holds an edge well. It is my first Shun knife and I hope to purchase additional Shun knives in the future. In the two years I've had the knife it has developed a few minor nicks in the blade. I attribute this to (1) the thin edge of the blade; and (2) the abuse I subject it to. I use this knife daily. It is the first knife I grab from the drawer whenever I cook. The handle and the surface of the blade are as new as the day I bought it. I use a sharpening steel to keep it honed but I think I need a whetstone or Japanese water stone to keep it in prime condition. I gave it 4 stars (instead of 5) because it requires more care than similarly priced kitchen knives.
5,My favorite knife,"Bought this knife a few years back (not from Amazon). Love it so much I actually found it here just to create this review. Dangerously sharp, holds an edge real well. Feels nice and solid in my hand."
5,Super Sharp Shun!,Love the knife! Also purchased the Shun honing steel which I use sparingly. A nice addition to my kitchen toolkit!
5,Schone Shines Again!,"A fabulous short story. Schone's knack for creating the flawed, scarred hero is marvelous. She brings depth to her characters and develops an intricate plot within a short story quite well. Only Ms. Schone could bring a eunich and a widow together in a moving, believable plot. I loved it. Definitely a keeper."
1,Erotica or Nausea?,"Within the first story a character, a clergyman, admits to behaving sexually with his sisters. If that's not enough to turn you away from this book I don't know what is. There is erotica and then there is nausea."
2,this book seems to be missing something,Bertrice Small's and Robin Schone's stories were the only ones that were decent read's in this book. I think that it is very hard to develop the sense of being in the book when the stories are short. I feel like there is some plot and character development the ends up left out to make the story shorter; I will so that these stories are hot and if you like to turn up the AC and steam-up the bathroom then you will enjoy this book.
4,"Fun, well made toy","My son got this for his birthday to go with the Black Pearl Flagship Battler. This one is just as well made, and detailed. He loves playing with it. One complaint; the cannonballs on both ships really launch (over 15 feet) so we have lost a lot of them. I think they should have adjusted the mechanism slightly so they didn't shoot so hard and far."
3,Pleasantly Surprised,"Though Taken by surprise with the occasional insert of the English Language, I was pleasantly surprised by this recording. Purchasing it with the intent to laugh and poke fun at it, I quickly found myself moved. It was nice to listen to this prestigious piece without understanding the lyrics.Not overly impressed by this recording's Valjean or Marius, I was pleasantly content with the ripe performances of the other performers.Most enjoyable to me was Fantine's I dreamed a dream. In my opinion, it is one of the better potrayals, second only to Randy Graff's performance on the Broadway Album.Worth the price? For me, yes. You be the judge."
5,Great Recording!!,"This is a very good recording of the musical. It contains nearly all of the material, as compared with the London and Broadway casts. I would not recommend this recording to new listeners, but for those who already appreciate this monumental musical, this is a great experience. This was one of two live albums of Les Miserables released in Japan in 1994. The other one, known as the Japanese ""Blue"" Cast, is very good as well, but this one has slightly better performances from the main actors."
2,Textbook of Ve...ter...inar...y....Zzzz....Zzzz...Zzzz,"This text was a required book in my first year vet anatomy course. I must say, the pictures and diagrams are only adequate. Meanwhile, the actual text itself was laborious to read and so full of jargon and unnecessary detail that it literally gave me a splitting headache each time I attempted to read it. Please, please, if this is not a required textbook, don't buy it! There are much better anatomy texts out there!"
3,"Very detailed, covers everything","This book is great if you have time to sit down and have a good read of it. It is not useful for quick checking of anatomy, yet this is what an atlas is for. If you take the time to read sections entirely it gives you a great understanding of the ""big picture"" and explains functional anatomy well."
5,Must read,Real life wisdom most of us ignore until we are miserable from denying our own needs to the benefit of others.
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"I received the book, I was disappointed on how yellow the pages were. Is this book really that old or was it not taken care of? I have started reading, but have not finished, so far so good."
1,I was disappointed,"I'm sorry, but I thought that both women in the book, Joan Anderson and Joan Erikson, were not only uninteresting but also annoying. Joan Anderson struck me as totally self-centered, and Joan Erikson as too ""cutesy"" and even conceited. I find it hard to believe that weaving little pieces of cloth using colors to represent life stages would so suddenly unlock the mystery of Joan A's life. Reminds me of adult ""Brownies"" . . . Too cutesy for me. Sorry."
5,Journey for Seekers.......,"From the stranger on the shore to becoming the beloved mentor, JOAN ERIKSON, is the driving force that allows Joan Anderson to truly push the boundaries further from the traditional role she played, to unveiling the ?unconventional woman? that Joan is today.The book is perhaps a tribute and ?thank you? to her playful and witty friend who helped Joan weave her way and; in turn, provide the gift of ?unconventional wisdom? that she received ~ to women curious enough to seek. Joan's writings are always enticing, and she continues to expose her frailties, as well as her triumphs, in ?A Walk on the Beach."""
2,"Corny, trite, and you've heard it all before","Joan Erikson is the magical old lady who spouts platitudes and wears funny straw hats to help the poor Joan Anderson deal with the privilege of having a mid-life crisis in a lovely beach house. They weave tapestries that represent life stages with different colors and they bond with seals. Their first meeting involves bits of wisdom about fog, and growing old, and being carefree, and nowhere do either of these women speak like real human beings, at least not human beings you don't want to smack or run far away from. The book is cloying and tries way too hard to be fraught with deep meaning. Poorly written and insulting to the intelligence, the middle-aged, and the elderly. There's nothing real or revolutionary about any of them. Two stars because I did manage to get through the whole thing but that's probably due to more to my book club than the book itself."
5,Vicarious Mentoring,"This story portrays the strength of friendship between two women who met by chance on the beach and changed each others lives. Joan describes the life lessons she learned from her mentor and best friend, who just happened to be the wife of Erik Erikson (famous psychologist).Each chapter left me feeling like I had just learned a valuable life lesson that needed time for digesting before moving on to the next. A very thoughtful, encouraging book...I will return to again and again."
1,"Self-centered, whiney...",This author came highly recommended. What a disappointment. I read several of her books and found them to be whiney and self-centered. Really enjoyed the stories about her mentor...the author should stick to writing children's books. Boring for adults...
5,powerful,"This book allows you to see theology beyond the basics. It should be recomended for all theological students, as it addresses reall issues in christian ministry."
2,Where are the lesbian scenes?,"What the heck is going on here? When you make a film about a cloistered nun and the cover picture even shows a nun apparently putting the moves on a younger woman, you expect at least one good lesbian scene! But this film doesn't have any! How can that possibly be?The beautiful young woman in the photo is the newest nun in the convent, and several of the older nuns cast covetous gazes in her direction as she removes her stylish clothing to change into her nun's habit. One slightly older nun in particular shows an interest in her, and later even tries to seduce the girl, but nothing comes of it as the girl refuses to comply. We also see a brief glimpse into this older nun's room where she happens to be entertaining another (nude) younger woman, but again we don't really see anything but that brief glance.Again, why make a film about a beautiful young novice surrounded by older women and then not include a single good lesbian scene? I don't get it."
2,fooled again by the packaging...!,"Although the young female star of this film is extremely attractive...Capt. Freaky is very disappointed in this Italian 'farce'!There are no lesbian scenes, no hetero-sex either...this film barely makes it past PG-13. The fact that it was released on to DVD should have never occurred. What is the point of '70's Euro Sexplotation films if they don't exploit?I gave it two stars....one for each of the young actresses incredibly beautiful (natural) breasts.Otherwise...the story gets ""0"" stars from me. It lets you down on every level."
4,"Product billed as ""signed"" copy","I bought this book on Amazon.com mainly because it was a ""signed"" edition. It wasn't signed."
5,Rainbows,Rainbow sandals are the best! They are totally comfortable and form-fit to your foot..plus they last forever. I will always own a pair!
5,Great sandal,Love this sandal. Got them for work-on my feet for hours. One of my customers recommended them. Glad I listened.
3,Not what expected,"This was my second pair of Rainbow sandals/flip flops, and the fit and feel are different from my first. The look, too, is different. I retuned the pair, thinking I might have the wrong size, and the second pair is just as disappointing.On the good side, the sellers had excellent service and response time to the issuesI'm not sure what happened, but the new Rainbows are not what they used to be, and just don't feel as comfortable; narrow and too snug."
2,Vastly overrated,"I owned a pair of the smooth leather Rainbows and loved them for two years, until the leather began to rub away to the spongy center layer. I tried the premier leather version, but they felt like wearing cardboard. The straps aren't soft enough to stretch and mold to your feet. Stick with the smooth leather version, or buy Reefs. They tend to be cushier and easier to break in."
4,just try it,"my dark brown actually turned out to be a lot lighter than the picture. anyways, with the rave about rainbows here in california, i had to try it out. to be honest, they ARE overrated as the best sandals ever. they are comfortable & fashionable but nothing that makes them worth that $40 price tag. what i do love about them is that i was able to wear them to disneyland (and you KNOW how much walking that is) a week after getting them - no blisters but a horrible slipper tan!i wear a size 7 in vans & got a size medium. i have wide feet yet they fit well. i tried on a size small and i could barely squeeze my foot into those glass slippers."
5,YAY!,"This is my first pair of Rainbows and I absolutely love them! I really like this color because it was different than the tan ones I normally see everyday at my high school. The were a little awkward at first but after I broke them in, they were so comfortable! The only con is that if you leave it in the sun or get it wet, it will wrinkle and shrink. But they are worth the money! I haven't had it long so I don't know how long they last, but I've heard they last several years! I recommend this product to all my friends :D-"
5,Rainbow fan,I can never get enough of Rainbow Sandals. I bought one for me and my boyfriend because it was about time to retire our old ones.
5,Great Product,"This is the second pair I've owned, I lost the last ones :(Super comfortable and very durable. I live in Florida, so I spend a lot of timein sandals...These are my fave!"
4,Cute sandals,"Really cute sandals...but they really hurt in the beginning, it takes time to wear them in. Although the tan colored ones get dirty REALLY easily, so take care of them! They sent them in on time and everything was great."
5,So comfortable!,"These flip flops are so comfortable, I look forward to the weekends when I get to wear them. They are a treat for my feet, just the right fit. The strap is wide and falls flat on the foot, doesn't dig into the skin. For my foot, the shape of these is perfect. I love them!"
1,SO narrow,These are so incredibly narrow. I waited too long to return them so I ended up giving them away. I've heard now from another friend to buy mens Rainbows if your feet aren't narrow.
5,I'd give them 10 stars if I could!,"Rainbow is such a great company!!!! I've worn flip flop sandals for years and never come across a brand as good as these! If you have ANY problems with them contact Rainbow. They are soooo helpful and courteous! I can't say enough! I've had three pairs. My husband wears them. My daughter had a pair that was getting really worn out after a few years of wear. They replaced them! How cool is that??? No hassle at all! I do recommend you know your size first. I personally prefer the wide straps. I first had the women's fine straps and they wore out a little more quickly. I am hard on shoes especially if I love them. This last pair I got was a men's small. I'm an 8.5 women's size street shoe, and this fits me PERFECTLY! Also, the womens' sizes are a bit narrower and my foot spilled over the sandal. The men's is a bit wider."
4,Best flip-flops,I wear mine like every day! They're so comfortable and durable. I recommend them to everyone I know and those who also buy enjoy them just as much
1,ODD,"I've been wearing and loving Rainbow sandals for well over 15 years...I can walk miles in them comfortably. These that I ordered surprised me as one sole was longer than the other! I had to return them, needless to say."
1,tremendously dissatisfied,"They do not start off telling you that these shoes run smaller sizes. You get the item and what would normally fit, doesn't. Then there is the idiotic restocking fee. How hard is it for an idiot to put it back on the shelf? I was very angry to have to deal with this problem. I sent them an e-mail to tell my feelings, but still had to pay the restocking fee to return the stupid shoes. I was very unsatisfied with Florida Footwear. People, buy these rainbow sandals locally!"
1,Rubber cover that surrounds ball joint ball on surround speaker mounts is VERY fragile,"After a couple of years, Rubber cover that surrounds ball joint ball on surround speaker mounts is VERY fragile and they are responsible for fixing it in the right position (standing up) lost the rigid mode and the speakers have felt down. NO replacement available in the marke since the plastic is part of the speakers. All of them (4) presented the same problem in a range of 1 year (after the second year of purchase). I lost my money. I have sent emails but no answers. Run out from Infinity. Their products are not serious."
3,The Chuck Norris of gaming,"Shadow Ops is nothing but a plain FPS. If anything, if is much like the formulaic action movies that plagued the 80s and early 90s.The plot is, as with the rest of the game, stock action-movie filler. You are some superbadass soldier. There is a nefarious villain with a nuclear device, You jet around the world, performing missions in the jungle, the snow, war-torn buildings, a train and the Eiffel tower.The enemy AI is pretty weak and it is not much difficult to kill them. Just shoot them in the foot, arms or torso, there is no difference. The tempo of the game is quite good however. I did not feel like there was dull moments maybe because I breezed through the game in 5 hours.There are better games and there are worse games."
3,OK,If you like Tom Clancy games you'll like this. It is a very intense thriller-style game involving a nuclear bomb and terrorists.
5,Best tongue scraper ever!,"I had this exact one and it lasted a long time. Somehow it got broken and when I went to buy a new one, I could not find this peticular one. I tried many other types and threw them all in the trash. This is the best one out there. Everyone is getting one of these in there xmas stocking this year."
3,back to AC/DC basics,"Their first three records showed that these guys were die-hard AC/DC lovers and with Rock The Block they're back on the track.They tried to change their style and follow the different metal-fashions, but it just didn't work. Singer Marc Storace is the only one I know that comes close to Bon Scott and in my opinion it wouldn't have been a bad thing if he had taken his place instead of Brian Johnson. And thanks to Marc Storace this album gets three stars. The songs on Rock The Block are not as catchy as the ones on Metal Rendez-vous (still their best) or Hardware, but the contrary would have been a miracle ! The only thing that I really don't like about the album is the demo-quality drum sound. The guitar work is fine, but more straight forward than in the early years and this makes them even more AC/DC-like than they've ever been ..."
3,Almost 4 stars!!,"Singer Marc Storace have rejoined Krokus! On ""Rock the block"" (2003) the band seem more mature and we get an album of AOR (Adult Oriented Rock). But don't despair, it still sounds like a more melodic AC/DC on many tracks. It's well produced and well performed, and even `tho the album contains as much as 14 songs there's no filler. Musically it's not as hard rocking as ""Hardware"", but nor as soft and slick as ""Change of address"". I'd say that Krokus have released a strong album on the verge to 4 stars. Instant favourites are ""Mad world"", ""Looking to America"" and ""Throwing her china""."
2,COPY PROTECTED,"WHAT ALL THE OTHER REVIEWERS DON`T MENTION IS THE FACT THAT THIS CD IS COPY PROTECTED.THAT MEANS FOR 30.00 DOLLARS YOU GET A CD YOU CAN`T MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF.SO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT OUT IN THE CAR,BE CAREFUL.IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS DISC.THE MUSIC IS GOOD BUT 30 DOLLARS TO GET COPYGUARDED.WHAT A RIP OFF."
1,Can't reveiw,"I ordered this album (cd) Feb 6th 2003, I have not yet received it, but when or if i do, i will give a review, both of the album and the service"
2,Not a canoe chair,"The chair is ok, the back is a little to short for me. I am 6 feet tall. I am not sure why they call it a canoe chair, there is no way to attach it to a canoe? If I had not been leaving for my trip the day after it came in the mail, I probably would have returned it and found something else."
4,Wish I could play guitar like that.,Cannot stop playing this dvd. Have purchased a couple of other SRV dvds but this one has me playing it over and over. The only negative point I can think of is that it is too short considering it is a combination of two separate concerts.
3,A bit disappointed...,"I had taped this show when it was on PBS several years ago. It is actually a compilation of two different shows. I thought that the DVD would have, perhaps, a few more songs, etc. Much to my surprise, they actually cut songs out! I was very disappointed in that fact and would not have even recommended this DVD at all except that there is a nice compilation (Bonus Video-Little Wing) that is NOT on my tape from PBS. It's a combination of still photos and video, with Stevie Ray playing ""Little Wing"" in the background, and very nicely done. So, it's sort of a compromise... I have more songs on my VHS tape I made from PBS, but the DVD has the ""Bonus video"". I believe the ACTUAL footage from each seperate PBS show is probably longer than even the tape I made. I just wish they would produce a DVD that includes everything from those two shows. I think the the band, and Stevie, would have wanted that."
2,Great preformance but sound quality is poor,This DVD deserves five stars for preformance but for technical quality I would give it one star. I don't know how Sony could stamp the Dolby Digital logo on this disk when it sounds as bad as it does. When I play it on my Onkyo DS-595 I get no center channel output and the bass is terrible. I have the SRV box set and it contains a DVD with songs from the same 1989 concert and it sounds like Dolby Digital should.
5,Great footage of a true Blues master.,"Pay no attention to the 80's hairband moron who wrote the bad review. Stevie proves that you don't have to play a Paganini Caprice at lighning speed to play with heart and soul. If you love the blues or simply love to see an true artist express himself with complete abandon, buy this DVD."
4,Amazing..,"I showed this video to my father-in-law who is neither a blues nor rock fan and even he was impressed. If you are a Stevie fan and haven't seen him perform you really should get this video. I don't know how you could truly appreciate how good he is without seeing the close-ups. He is lightning fast but speed is only a small part of his talent. Everything fits and his runs aren't just ornamentation. The pictures are good, not great. Seems too dark, especially the early scenes. His last performace is significantly better than the first. He looks more relaxed and seems to be enjoying himself and his music more. His eyes are open more and the sound is more soulful. There is a bonus cut at the end which is the remake of Hendrix's ""Little Wing"". It stayed with me for days. I can only guess that God wanted a private performance."
1,"Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble: Live From Austin, Texas","Played this through Technics AC500-D DTS/Dolby digital processor and Onkyo 919 receiver. Had to immediately turn off Velodyne sub because of very excessive low end (could hear almost nothing else). Never had trouble with any media (DVD, Laserdisc, CD, VHS, etc) before. Listened to 2 songs...turned it off and called Sony (number on back of DVD) to ask if defective copy or just bad mix. Awaiting answer from Sony."
5,A New editing is needed,"Not too long ago, Austin City Limits played a show of all the SRV ""outtakes"" that were not originally aired, such as ""Couldn't Stand The Weather"", ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" and ""Superstition. Somewhere, somebody needs to get the original SRV release and mix it together with the outtakes for a complete DVD."
1,Great performance. Poor audio quality!,"I enjoy the music of Stevie Ray Vaughn but this DVD was a big disappointment. The preformance was very good but the audio quality was Very Poor!!In 2 previous reviews, one agreed with me about the poor audio quality and the next that said how good this sounds, particularly on his 5.1 dolby digital player. I wish I would have understood the tech notes. This is not recorded in dolby digital 5.1. It is recorded in dolby 2.0. There is a Big difference! We tried listening to it as 5.1 dolby, Pro Logic, and straight stereo. None sounded good.If a superior recording engineer can bring this baby back to life, I would absolutely want to own it. But until that time, it remains on the shelf gathering dust."
5,Amazing.,"This is an amazing DVD of one of the greatest musicians ever born. If you have even a passing interest in the blues or guitar, do yourself a big favor and grab this."
1,Leave this one alone.......,"The audio and visual quality are very poor. I'm a big fan of SRV, but this was disappointing. Unless you're just a huge fan, I'd let this one slide."
5,Great find!,Love Stevie Ray and this Austin City Limits is great. He was gone long before his time.I received it in record time too.
3,OK for collectors but...,"I enjoyed this DVD, but I agree with the others that it is not well produced. And the 1989 show was much better than the earlier one - refined, light-hearted, and powerful. So, if you want to get a better glimpse at his 1989 ACL performance, get the SRV Box Set. The fourth disk contains six fantastic songs from that show and they rock. It's a smaller collection but the performance, video, and audio are superior!"
3,"Decent song selection, not great sound quality","I purchased this DVD for my father. He is a big Stevie Ray fan and had recorded the Austin City Limits ""outtakes"" from these two shows a few years ago. He watches this tape constantly, so I figured that the real show would be quite good too. The set from the first show is great! It is the ""old"" Stevie. Great songs, great sound quality. The second performance isn't as good. The songs were not as recognizable and the sound just wasn't that good. It was quite muffled actually! I'm not sure why the quality dropped off between the two shows but it was pretty distracting. My father and I watched the video together and both commented about how it didn't sound good. Maybe it was just the DVD I got."
2,Produced by chimps?,"This is the most badly produced concert of any sort I have ever seen on any medium in my life. To say the sound is brutal is giving it too much credit. I give it 2 stars because it's SRV, and I am a big fan. However, if I had produced this I would be too embarassed to release it. It doesn't say much for those who take credit for the production."
4,Excellent,"I loved just about everything about this dvd, the video is great, the sound is great, and of course Stevie Ray Vaughan is more than great. The one bad thing about it is that for some reason the sound and video are a little off-sync. I don't know if this is the dvd or my drive, I don't think it's my drive because I just bought a new one. So that's just one thing to keep in mind, but all things considered it's a small price to pay."
4,"Great DVD, sound not so great.",This DVD is a must for anyone who is SVR fan.The sound on the first part is pretty good but not great.The two Austin City Limits appearances are legendary and rightfully so.
3,SRV on the Austin City Limits Show,"If you're looking for a DVD of SRV just for enjoyment and appreciation of Stevie's talents, this is a good one. The DVD is advertised as showing some of his earlier performances, and then contrasting some later ones. I was hoping to see the growth and development of his playing over time, but I didn't find it in this DVD. The tunes are the basically the same, the playing is routinely the same, so I decided I would give the DVD to a younger player who might just watch it and feel some sense of inspiration. But its really not for the mature guitarist looking for more ideas."
2,"Travel and storage is great, but not a well made product","We have had this bed rail for about 6 months and it is already broken. It has not been misused, but my child would frequently roll in to it in his sleep. I assumed it would be designed to take this kind of pressure, but it broke at one of the plastic joints.It was great for travel because it breaks down, but I had a hard time dismantling the pieces.I will definitely be replacing this with a different brand. Very disappointed."
2,Bed Rail,"Great quality; however, rail it so wide that it hits the floor. I had to return this product."
4,Just what Grandma needed,"This set of bed rails is just what I needed for my toddler grandson's conversion from the crib to a twin bed. They are sturdy and tall, and the fact that they are connected together under the mattress seems to make them even stronger. As a babysitting grandma, I only have the toddler for naps a couple times a week so I haven't needed to change bedding as often as a parent would. He actually sleeps on top of the comforter, therefore, I can't fairly judge them on the ease of changing bedding with the one drop down side. By the way, I am using this product on a twin captain's bed so to avoid the problems of the recessed mattress, I raised the platform so it is flush with the top of the bed. It works great."
2,would be perfect,"this would be perfect if both sides were enforced at the ""elbows"". one side is and is perfect. the other, well it worthless. ended up breaking completely in the first 30 days. wish it would've lasted longer."
5,Excellent CD features an all-time great cantaor,"One of the best singers in the history of cante flamenco is Nino de Almaden, whose talents are highlighted on this wonderful disc of traditional flamenco song and guitar accompaniment. Almaden is supported on the guitar by Pedro Soler, his favorite player, as the two were regular companions at the peak of their artistic careers. This flamenco series is as good as the more popular ""Chant du Monde"" collection but seems not to have reached as wide an audience of aficionados. Almaden's and Soler's collaborations are included on other anthologies in this series but here the entire program is devoted to these two performers and the music illustrates why they are considered among the best interpreters of flamenco song and guitar playing."
4,Filmed in the Lake Tahoe area.,"The picture was filmed in and around Harrah's Club at Lake Tahoe Nevada. Nice outdoor shots of the lake, from the California and Nevada side. First movie filmed atDisneyland, which is the weak point for adults (slapstick for the kids) of the movie. However it is a good photo history of the park from the early 1960's. Cute story with a great cast including Phil Silvers, nice family movie."
4,Awesome,Great movie. Awesome picture quality. I just loved the scenes around disneyland. I highly recommend this movie to any Disney fan mainly because of the really old footage of the Disneyland park. I would have never known this movie existed if it wernt for miceage.com for showing pictures from the film. The movie overall I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.
1,Bad disk?,"I just got the DVD for ""40 Pounds of Trouble"" and the disk doesn't work, so I can't tell you how good the movie is. I tried it in both my laptop and my DVD player and it wouldn't play in either one."
3,"Fun movie, poor DVD","This is a fun movie for its time and it actually stands up pretty well. The only disappointment is the quality of the DVD. There is a tendency to seeing comb lines when played. It is rather poor. I had expected better quality. It is nice to see it in original format, but the fuzzy transfer is not acceptable. I bought three other Vault Series recordings, and they all suffered from the same inadequate transfer."
2,Great Disneyland shots,"The story is weak, the acting marginal; however, there are great shots of 1960s Disneyland. There must 20 minutes of views around Disneyland. The best shot is a fake in which the actors disembark from the monorail and look down Main Street. To this day people believe there had been a monorail stop on Main Street due to this film. There are some great period shots of what it used to be like boarding an airplane, a United Airlines DC-7, and the long since halted helicopter service from LAX to Disneyland directly. If you're a Disney collector, its worthwhile. If not, don't bother."
4,"For 20th century music fans, this is a must have title!","Berg journies into the fracturing madness of a relationship where ""Wozzeck"" (a soldier undergoing experimental medical treatments to supplement his meager salarie) discovers that his lover has cheated on him with another soldier in his unit. This rest of the story unfolds to reveal the devastation and mental anguish of the entire affair. The final scene is easily the most heart wrenching and anguish filled of modern opera. WARNING: Composed in 12 tone atonality, excellent study work. At times the cinematography is less than perfect, but it was recorded live. EXCELLENT VOCAL PERFORMANCES of incredibly difficult music."
2,"Needs to be updated, not enough information",This seems to have been written for the previous iteration of the BCMSN. There are some inaccuracies and I'd say that 40% of what's covered on the test is not in here. You will NOT be prepared for the test if you have only this. The Cisco Press and Exam Cram 2 are good but some practical knowledge is also required with the new test.
2,A sloppy production,"I used the Cisco Press CCNA Certification Guide to pass the CCNA exam and then used the Sybex BCMSN Study Guide to study for the exams. Not only I found big different between the contents, I also found the production quite sloppy. Found some misprint in the book but according to sybex.com, there are no updates to this book, while there is a 4 page errata to the Cisco Press BCMSN Certification Guide, which I eventually pay an extra $50 for. Did the exam and found some terms which I have never found in the Sybex book while some of the chapters were not in the exam at all. Very surprised.All in all the Cisco Press books are a much better candidate for CCNP and this book did not closely match the exam topics published by Cisco. I would not recommend this book to anyone studying for CCNP."
2,A bit dry,"Some of the videos in the famous authors series are wonderful. I particularly like the Emily Dickinson one. However, this one was very dry. For a man who is so interesting, this video made 30 minutes about him seem very long. The students I showed it to were unfortunately bored."
5,daily help for parents,"buy a copy for your bookshelf, and some for gifts. Great advice on daily ups and downs. This book is full of things to relate to as a parent and a human being.I only wish I had it the first time around. Mrs. Solberg has filled this book with ideas, stories, advice, experience and friendship.Keep it close at hand, read it often.."
3,Not what expected,"I thought that these gloves will handle well working with gasoline, but wasn't that way. Specifications did not say that will not resist gasoline, it is written in the box of the product (which you cannot see until you have it in your hands).They don't resist puncture well either after working with them for a while."
1,"Very thin, break easily. Avoid!",I use these gloves for auto repair but they break so easily. I would recommend another product over this. Just too thin!
2,work gloves,I purchased these because they were described and useful for automotive work. Maybe writing up automotive estimates but not work. They fell apart in 35 minutes. I am very disappointed.
2,marginal,"Ok gloves.I dont know why the glove shown on the box was purple and they ship blue ones instead. I really wanted purple to seperate my blue ones, which I use for another purpose. Not that big a deal, but it is some what misleading . The gloves will get you buy, but light tasks only, or they will most certainly rip."
2,Good gloves but don't like the powder.,"The gloves are about the same as other Nitrile gloves that I've used as far as strength. I decided to try the powdered gloves because once you use a pair of normal gloves and they tear, you generally have to wait a few minutes to put new gloves on because of sweat.Unfortunately the powder on these gets on anything that you're working on (interior or engine or whatever). If this doesn't bother you, then these gloves are great.Because of this, you'll find me recommending the ""SafeTouch Nitrile Exam Gloves, Non Latex, Powder Free"" gloves that I bought after these."
3,NIght time Racing,Great for beginning racers. Based on night time. Drifts are not like the real ones but that's what makes it easier.
1,the fast and furious,this game sucks it not real drifting and the game play is pain. When doing drifts the cars do not react as they would in real life. A waste of money.
2,Mr. Disapointed,"The game did not do the ""Fast and the Furious"" name credit. Visually to rough for the eyes, not smooth. Sub par graphics. Did not feel any real sense of speed. Gald I didn't pay $39.99....................."
5,Brilliant!!,"I couldn't put this book down!! What an amazing debut for this young author. It is a psychological thriller/love story, and then there is the final, sardonic twist at the end. Who really is the author of this book? I loved reading THE MUSE ASYLUM. It is definitely my memorable novel of the summer of 2001."
4,Big Themes,"The best thing about this book is that it deals with some great 21st Century themes:The Nature of Self and IdentityIn passing:Twins StudiesParallel universesQuantum theoryBut it is not a mature work. The first chapter is vividly written but the style goes downhill after. The book is too long, it is really an O'Henryesque short story aimed at a surprise ending. Lara should have been minimized or edited out; she is boring.All the characters talk alike. I have known schizphrenics and let me tell you, Andrew does not talk like a schizophrenic.If this seems too harsh and you would challenge me to do better, see my novel Qualiens for sale on Amazon.If this guy is really only like 25 and only four years past college and his mother didn't write this after long years of doing his homework for him, then he has GREAT potential. Pray that he drops out of medical school"
2,Human interest story ruins yet another good plot,"DO NOT BE FOOLED! This book is not about the search for an enigmatic author. It's about a love-triangle between a loser reporter with no direction in life, a young woman searching for meaning by sleeping around, and a mental patient. Three ... college grads pretend to have problems, if I wanted that I'd have stayed in the real world."
4,BANG SCREW,Go get u some purple drank n some indo n let it play overall a sicc cd if u r a screw fan this is a must have
2,Shallow on J2EE security !,"I was quite disappointed in this book, which is both drawn-out and shallow in its coverage of j2ee and web services. With 425 pages (11 chapters), the book only talks about J2EE component security in 2 chapters (Chapter 9 and 10) and stops at high-level with spending pages on configuring tomcat and weblogic 7. The author comfortably skipped discussing content over complex issues and finally completely forgot about illustrating real-world security issues and measures.Although the book covers some very basic aspects of Java security, ultimately it provides a dreary drawn-out overview of j2ee security which is better found more in google and elsewhere."
2,A little bit of everything,"The title is, definitely, misleading: it does not cover the subject of J2EE security. One cannot build a secure application with this book! There are lots of great books on the Standard Edition security, and there is no need to go over it again, particularly when J2EE presents so many new issues and problems one needs to take care in order to build a commercial application. Otherwise the book is easy to read and understand."
1,Disappointing !,"I am not new to J2EE, but I purchased this book for understanding J2EE security based on the good reviews it has received. I was quite disappointed in this book, which is both repetitive, drawn-out and shallow in its coverage of J2EE as a whole. Although the book covers the basics but it missing the real world complexities such as Single sign-on, JAAS Authentication and Authorisation in J2EE, Integration tier security etc. The book is completely lost in Web services security as it considers only SOAP-RPC security, repeating the similar examples from Axis and Verisign. BTW, This book only covers obsolete versions of Axis, Weblogic and Verisign. As a result almost nothing is covered in great detail, and the ages ultimately provide a dreary drawn-out overview of J2EE security which I find better elsewhere. Now the book stays on the shelf collecting dust, while I google around the Internet for answers."
2,It's great while it works...,"...and then it falls apart. Bought the unit, had it less than a month, had it replaced and still no joy. The basic problem is that while the sound quality on hearing your caller was always superb, the volume with which the other party can hear you worked fine then diminished to a whisper--and no amount of fiddling with the microphone position or warranty repair could correct the problem. Additionally, the ergonomics of the unit (considering that the mic has to be practically IN your mouth to work when it worked at all) are very wonky. In the first few weeks while the unit was working properly, I still ended up wrapping the cord up and over my other ear (as I used to do with my freebie earbud hands free) to stabilize it. Overall I can say that I am a HUGE supporter of the noise cancelling technology they are pioneering, but that this product is an equally HUGE disappointment."
3,backboard and hoop are separating from the base,When filled with water this basketball net has good stability. We have had plenty of teenagers playing ball in our pool and it has stayed stable on the concrete decking. The problem that we are having is that the screws that hold the backboard onto the base have pulled out of the plastic holes and will not stay in. We have even tried using wall anchors to hold the screws in - that didn't work either. The molded plastic is very durable but doesn't hold a screw very well.
1,no more than 6 month!!,"!!!backboard and hoop are also separating from the base!!! same problem of DONNA,unfortunately this review was not on the web when i bought it.The screws that hold the backboard onto the base have pulled out of the plastic holes and will not stay in after 2 month of use. I have even tried using wall anchors to hold the screws in - that didn't work either. The molded plastic is very durable but doesn't hold a screw !!.don't loose money"
5,Great resource,Really helped me to come to terms with channeling and was really pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is and that anyone interested can do this work. Thanks to the authors and their guides!
5,Great book to learn from,Opening to Channel is written like a workshop in a book. It has basic information in regards to channelling and expanding awareness. It includes a good number of exercises to prepare a person to become a channel. A very useful book.
5,great book,"this is my first book on channeling, and im very happy that i picked this one. its very easy to read, and it keeps the exercises as simple as possible. there are no big long extravagant rituals to memorize and im thankful for that! like i said, im a beginner, but now i have hope of consciously contacting my guides. maybe in the future i will write another review on this book and its impact on my spiritual path, but im sure this book will always get good reviews from me!"
2,"What this book teaches is light meditation, not channeling.","It's a start for beginners, but don't expect this will put you in contact with higher entities."
5,This book was everything I wanted it to be!,"From the author of ""My Truths, Accepting Higher Knowledge""... One of the best books I have ever read. There is an absolute abundance of information provided in this book for any one who wishes to learn to channel. It was the source of inspiration I needed to pursue my interests. I've referred many to this book as it is truly an excellent work. I am so appreciative."
5,Brilliant!,Absolutely fantastic. It does help you strenghten and develop your connection with your guide!
3,Not what I expected,I was expecting a more detailed section of how to channel. Just not what I wanted but not bad for someone trying to understand channeling.
4,LOOKING FOR NEW OPTIONS,"THIS BOOK WAS RECOMMENDED AND I AM HAPPY I GOT IT.JUST KNOWING WHAT IS POSSIBLE, KNOWING WHAT OTHER OPTIONSARE OUT THERE IS VERY EMPOWERING..TO ALL SEEKING TO CONNECT....''"
5,Lights...,The books emits light of comfort and consolation.It is a journey to the depth of your soul.A companion on the road of perplexity. A light at the end of the tunnel. Read it.
1,What a joke,"This book is RIDICULOUS.I FULLY believe in channeling but this book is half ""written"" by ""Daben"" (one of the author's spirit guides), and half from the authors---- nonsense.After reading over half of this book talk about how wonderful and easy it is to channel if you just ask (and Daben ""says"" he will help you meet your guide if you just ask him), and giving you some ""pointers"" on how to start meditating--- it's not any different than any other ""beginning meditation"" book, except it is ""written"" by the authors' ""spirit guides"" too-----I wouldn't waste my money on this one--- try someone else. This one to me, is useless and simply ridiculous as well."
4,Old Workhorse,"I learned basic, old-style, nongenerative, phonology that was intended to prepare the way for developing a useful orthography for a hitherto unwritten language from this book. Actually, I never did plow my way through the entire book, but did manage to prepare an acceptable orthography during the final 2-week project at SIL-UND in 1970.The author, Kenneth Pike, was Professor of Linguistics and President of the Summer Institute of Linguistics for many years. His work as a consultant contributed to the productivity of hundreds of linguistic fieldworkers serving preliterate peoples throughout the world."
2,Empowering Human Resources in the Merger and Acquisition Pro,"The book only provides a small amount of good, basic information about the role of human resoures in M&As. The majority of the book simply reviews the results of a survey that the authors published - certainly not one needs to read in order to learn about HR and M&As. The book also many times restated what was written in the first few chapters. Certainly not worth the high price of the book - maybe worth $15.00?Buy it only if you are willing to pay a high price tag for a very basic, simple, brief introduction to M&A in the HR profession."
2,"Fast reading, but not the best I've read","Some might find this little novel ""hilarious"". I found it mildly amusing and somewhat contrived. The heroine is believable only if you place her age in her early 20s. The characters are shallow, and the reader is left knowing almost nothing about them except their sexual orientation. This book was given to me. Having read it, I would not recommend it for purchase. There is a lot of excellent lesbian/gay fiction out there. Only when you've finished many of them--fiction and non-fiction--would I recommend picking up this volume."
2,okay,"I found this book okay but disappointing. The characters felt hollow andnot sympathetic or interesting. The action did not grip me,and one of the sex scenes was a bit nauseating. I could not understandwhy someone of such an interesting background as Schulman's wouldwrite something so simple and way over the top with downtown ""cool""stereotypes. But there was a flow and rhythm, and maybe Schulmanhas done better work afterwards."
5,Make Time to Sleep,"This book is well written and expresses common sense by reinforcing our sleeping habits to gain longer lives and greater energy for conducting family, business, and sports/exercise activities on a daily basis. Many people do not sleep enough, particularly young people below 20 years of age, business people with high stress responsibilities, and athletes. I enjoyed the book and the recommendations made. This book should be a must read for everyone. Sincerely,Dale Jensen"
5,Superb read - an unexpected pleasure!,"I was skeptical but a friend told me to try it and I can't put it down! This is an excellent book, well written and captivating. A wonderful and honest memoir."
5,Raw and Honest,"A must read for anybody, but moreso for every gay man who's made the journey from straight life to gay. It has a bit of everything that we all can relate to---dealing with inner struggles and daily reconciliations. It takes you from an insulated world, through the marines, sex, drugs, rehab to landing on one's feet."
5,Shameless story of a private life,"Secrets of a Gay Marine Porn Star delved deeply into the heart, soul and mind of a young man who was a student at Bob Jones University, which rejected anything remotely known to have homosexual overtones. Mr. Merritt tells of his stint as a U.S. Marine, his times as a gay porn star, and how he came to reconcile himself in this crazy world of ours. It doesn't matter what you do, but who you are that counts."
5,the value of one's story,"The most gratifying aspect of this book far exceeds the prurience surrounding the ""porn star "" stuff. Merritt tells his story completely and honestly; this is truly a life examined. It is this wllingness to gaze clear-eyed at his complex journey that has stayed with this reader. This is a brave, inspiring and ultimately compassionate memoir, worth the price and effort."
5,Awesome debut!,"I was spell-bound. To be from the same city, with much of the same background, it was like looking in the mirror. The first 125 pages or so are my story too. When I meet someone, I always want to know things like ""when did you KNOW"" and ""how did you come out."" This book answers those questions and many more, so by the time you hit the back cover, you really feel like you are a comfortable old friend of Rich Merritt! Cudos, Rich!"
5,an edge of your seat read,"This is one of the most touching insightful books i have read in a long time. i could hardly put it down. i would read it at work just because i couldn't wait to know what would happen next. i highly recommend this book and after having spoken with the author via email, i have found him to be a really down to earth guy. someone i'd be proud to call friend"
5,Best Honest Autobiography for the Twenty-First Century,"""Secrets"" demonstrated Mr. Merritt's ability to not only show us the inner workings of a gay man, but to give us an understanding of how religion and society can influence and try to destroy people that are different from their norm. Mr. Merritt's honest look at himself and his upbringing should make all of us look inside ourselves and change our concepts of human/gay rights in this country. I congratulate Mr. Merritt in writing a piece that is so heart rendering."
5,Story of a Survivor,"I bought this book because of the similarites between the author's life and my own. Both of us came out of repressive, abusive Fundamentalist Christianity, both of us served in the military, both of us battled substance abuse, and both of us are gay. This is one man's story, and it's the story of a survivor...in short, it's my story, and the story of countless others as well. There, but for the grace of God, go all of us. Rich Merritt came through the fire, as have so many of us. Well done, Rich! This is a helluva read."
1,I got it because of the title,"I won't deny that--the title itself is very intriguing (and funny). Unfortunately that's the best thing about the entire book. The author goes into tiresome detail about EVERYTHING in his life. Again--EVERYTHING! It doesn't matter if it has nothing to do with the title--it's all about him. Some of it is interesting but, after a while, you get bored. By the last hundred pages I was basically skimming just to FINISH the thing. This book needed a real good editor. As it is it's unfocused and frankly just boring."
1,Just Who Was He In Porn?,"I think the Advocate had every right to discriminate against this book. Clearly this guy was trying to sell this book based upon his so called ""porn career"". However, he obviously didn't make an impression in that arena because there is no mention of who he was in porn in any of these reviews. So I'm guessing he made 3rd rate films for a no-name porn company. You would think since he is hawking the book by way of his prior porn-status, he would have been ""named"". Pass this book up guys, who really wants to read another sob story of a loser? He gives all gays a bad name. Not all gays do drugs and are alcoholics. Just the low-life ones."
1,out-dated and boring,"This book absolutely made our whole class hate psychoanalysis. It was so boring and antiquated. Because it is so old, it just goes into excruciating detail about Freud's theories that really doesn't reflect modern psychodynamic approaches. If you want to have someone hate psychoanalysis, this is a sure way to go."
1,Get your hands on the original!,"Nothing can take the place of the wonderful original film starring Terrance Stamp as Billy Budd. Sure, it's in black and white, but that just adds to the theme of the film, that there is no black and white where justice is concerned. I hope Amazon will be able to offer the original for sale soon!"
1,No shame,"The original 1962 Billy Budd, directed by, and starred in by Peter Ustinov, is a classic. One of my favorite movies of all time. I remember seeing it while serving in the US Navy. The story is very compelling and heart-wrenching. I've been telling my wife all about the movie and set out to search for it, but the only Billy Budd movie I could find is this one. I was very dissappointed because an opera, to me, is foolish and annoying. I hope Amazon can offer the ""real"" movie soon. I will be the first one in line to get it."
2,"More appropriately, Mr. Happy Policeman","The cover makes you think it's a good book.I could have sworn a man wrote this phallically oriented dreck. The thing I remember the most about this story is the Doctor Who reference and that embarassingly bad section about the ""greptusian(whatever the heck those aliens were called) handshake,"" a term the author invented to describe oral intercourse. Ick."
3,It's Okay,"This is a nice way to organize all your recipes. The book comes with several dividers, cards and empty pages. It has a nice ""retro"" look to it as well. However, the letters on the front were not properly glued down and began to fall off... now it doesn't look so nice."
4,Retread of an older album for a good cause,"Produced by the same company as the ""Snap Your Fingers"" CD below, and even borrowing the cover art, this is a track for track copy of that CD. The difference is, according to the label, that some proceeds from this division support a charitable trust."
5,Gore Vidal is a witty chronicler of American History,"Vidal's latest book is a criticism of American history, and how imperialism became the dominant factor in American foriegn policy. Vidal has many unique insights into America, and more of these can be found in his article for the latest issue of Vanity Fair. Always witty and stylish, Vidal goes against the grain yet again. Here is an intriguing new book by an American master."
4,"Clinton brings out the ""crazy"" in people","Vidal is Vidal. Bill Clinton, fortunately or unfortunately, brings out the expostulating craziness in people, the tendency toward extravagant en passant paranoia. Caveat lector."
2,smells more like soap than Tee Tree,"This deodorant goes on nicely, it's a little moist, but it smells like a slightly masculine soap. Desert Essence makes a tea tree deodorant that actually smells like tea tree and works great."
1,Replaced by a different product,"I used this every day for decades. When my local co-op stopped carrying it, I special-ordered it for a while, then decided to buy it here. This product has the same name as what I've used, but a different appearance (new label, white cap instead of brown), and a completely different scent. Where the old one was subtle and herbal, this one is pungent and perfumey. It makes my eyes water for hours. Can't use it."
3,"This thing is on, right?","I bought this since it's all natural agent that helps neutralize unpleasant body odors, inhibits bacterial formation and perspiration. Sure, but for how long? Now to be honest, I never tested how long this lasts however I did notice my under arm odor hit full blast during strenuous activity. Now for me strenuous is yoga and it can get pretty sweaty but it's not incredibly strenuous so I can only imagine it getting worse the harder you workout. As I'm writing this, it's 15:42 and I did a direct inhale at my arm pits without any odor and I applied it around 06:00. This item is definitely not long lasting. All I wanted was something to work for a whole day but I do notice odor before I turn in for the evening. I'm going to try and reapply before my pilates class tonight. Wish me luck!Pros: All natural, inexpensive.Cons: May not work under strenuous activity. May require numerous applications."
1,New formula is terrible,"This deoderant is a diffrent formula from the Queen Helene Vitamin E Deoderant we've used for years. Even though it's advertized using the same picture, the actual package is different, it has a much longer list of ingredients which are different from the ""old"" formula (I compared it to the ""old"" deoderant), and a much stronger smell. It makes my husbands underarms itch and burn. His skin is red and inflamed. I'm afraid to try it."
4,canine physio,"A good introductory book for the sports minded Physical Therapist. Was a little disappointed in the simplicity of it, with the majority of persons buying this book already liscensed PT's the author could have been a little more technical."
2,Ballet Dance,"Saying that this DVD was a disappointment would be an understatement. The quality is poor,filming amateurish and it doesn't show much dancing. There are far better DVDs out there for beginners even though they are aimed at girls."
5,Great resource!,"For anyone looking to learn about Oracle 10g, start here! Excellent resource for Oracle veterans new to 10g, as well as folks new to Oracle in general. Easy to read - concise and clear. Covers all major facets that you need - database, networking, sql / pl/sql, etc.A must read for Oracle DBAs!"
2,Useless and confusing,"This book tells a lot of notions about oracle db, and this can be at first interesting for beginners, but without a logical order: there is no structure, there is no logical consequence in what is written, sometimes even in the same pageThis aspect is particular evident in the bakup and recovery section: the authors have written a blob of informations totally unrelated with each otherThe choice of the topics is very strange too: there is nothing about fundamental topics, like oracle installation (not even for windows) but there is place for very advanced topics, not so useful for beginners, like xml in oracle db and data partitioning.The result: this book can be attractive for the large numbers of topics discussed, but it can be very, very confusing"
1,Not a good book. Not a solution for any problem,"I know beginners need a book wich talks about only a few topics, the most important. And it must be clear and not too deep way. But it doesn't mean you can take a time with each topic. This book passes over every chapter at the speed of light, leaving many issues unexplained.To all of this, it must be added the fact that the book costs as much as other really wonderfull and longer books.It's been frustrating that feeling I had while reading, as I have wasted my money and I'll have to buy another. Any search in google for oracle tutorials gives more information than that book."
2,Definitely not worth the money,"I have been a SQL Server DBA for years along with FoxPro, DB2, etc. But I still found this book very confusing.Is it just me or did the examples not match anything in the Oracle 10g sample database that I loaded? Plus the EM did not even look the same. What's with that? Kind of hard to do the examples when nothing matches.Worst beginners book I've ever read. If it wasn't for the fact that I was familiar with some of the concepts already, this book would have been totally useless.If you are a true beginner, look for a different book. This one won't help."
1,Very Poor Guide,I have been studying DB structure and SQL for years. I mainly purchased this book to learn more about the structure of Oracle's 10g product. This book is extremely poorly written and very confusing. The examples in the book are not correlated with the Oracle sample DB's included with the 10g platform. I found myself many times becoming confused about topics that I already have great knowledge about and have studied for years because the explanations in the book are very poorly done. I read 75% of the book then tossed it in the trash...
1,Possibly the worstbook - ever,This is possibly the worst book in this category I've ever seen. I'm an experienced SQLServer DBA and thought this book would be fairly useful as a starting place for getting into Oracle. Its a total dud. It looks like the authors have picked a whole bunch of random bullet points out of the Oracle help files and thrown them together with a mild semblance of organisation. I would bet that a 'dummies' book would be better!!!!!!!!!
3,Oracle 10g: the complete reference is way introduction,"After reading both books, I must agree that this one has a lot of mistakes in it and can sometimes be a bit confusing. If you don't want to spend too much money but need a practical introduction then choose this book, if you plan on spending anyway, just buy 'Oracle 10g: the complete reference' straight away. It's better structured, everything used in examples is explained well. It's not a bad book but compared to the complete reference it's confusing. If you just installed oracle 10g on your computer, be sure to unlock the HR, OE, PM, IX, SH schemes if you want to be able to reproduce the exercises. (I found that nowhere referenced and it might be a bit confusing for a total newbie to find out)"
2,Oracle Database 10g: A Beginner's Guide,The examples use very different tables. No table creation and table insertion procedures are in the downloadable sql examples. This makes the reconstruction of the examples almost impossible.
1,Disappointing,"I am not a fan of the style in which this book is written. I find it distracting. There's something about the presentation of the information that annoys me. And what's up with all the .tif files? Am I supposed to have coincident online access to get the most out of this book?Also, there are enough errors that I find them both annoying and sometimes simply confusing.This book contains a strange hodgepodge of incomplete topics. To me it seems hastily conceived and I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Really poor...,"Just like other reviewers have written, it is really a poor guide... from the fisrt pages you know that the book is missing it's target..."
5,I love this program.,"I watched this show on local PBS until they took it off and I intend to get every DVD that is issued. The show has a 30 year history and anyone in the family can watch without being shocked by something. To bad that the US networks WON'T come up with something like this. Who would have thought, clean laughs and no violence. What a concept."
4,Clean & Funny British Humor,"Last of the Summer Wine is funny, relaxing, great scenery,I have been a fan since 1996, I watch them over and over.Marvelous characters with funny sense of humors."
4,last of the summer wine 1977,nice british comedy sit-com with wonderful scenery of yorkshire pity there are very few dvds of the series.
4,The Last of the Summer Wine DVD,I bought this series for my dear friend as a birthday gift.She loved it.
5,Last of the...,More good episodes. I just wish they would release more in each CD I can't believe a whole year of this show produced less than 10 episodes...
2,Jewels don't stick for long....,"The girls (3 & 5) had fun sticking everything on, but they needed lots of help handling the small jewels. They did not stick very well to the smooth surface of the pig. Overall, it turned out very cute, but I find another jewel poppped off just about every day. Pretty soon it won't be very cute anymore. Also, the tutu looks funny because it is stuck on with these gel adhesive things that are still visible after it is stuck on so it doesn't look so good."
2,Cute premise - but didn't work out.,None of the charms/decorations stayed attached for very long (maybe a day)- it looks pretty bad. The bank itself is fine and still intact.
1,Waste of a buck!!!,Game would not work.Would load then either freeze up or I would get a notice saying the disk was dirty/defective.
1,It smells really bad,I'm really used to use daily products like that. But this one smells really bad and it doesn't make easier to shave. I don't recommend.
1,Bad and not worth the money,"I was looking for a short story book to read to my husband before bed. He has severe dementia so an ordinary book wont do. These have to be the stupidest, incomplete stories I have ever read in my life. You are reading the one or two page story and it just ends. You are sitting there thinking ""what the heck happened to the rest of the story"". Some of the 'stories' are not stories at all but just a mass of words that make no sense what so ever. I cannot believe anyone would have the nerve to actually put their name on this book. And I am sure it had to be self published as no reputable publisher would touch this with a ten foot pole. Do I recommend this book? Hardly."
1,Dreadful collection,"I simply can't believe that this collection got such good reviews.Pretty much all the stories are absolutely awful, heavan knows What the authors were on when they wrote them.If you are looking for good writing, plot, characterisation, you wont find it in this collection. If you enjoy mindless, rambling writing, you will find it here in abundance.For me, this book was a complete waste of time and money."
2,Not my cup of tea,"It was alright. There was a special on NPR about a movement in ""Hint fiction"" (1-paragraph stories)--that's what I expected this would be, from the summary I read. It wouldn't have been disappointing, except that the stories didn't come across as particularly inspired to me. None of them held my interest, but to be fair, I'm a tough critic, especially when it comes to fiction."
5,"Fast, Fun, & Furiously Inventive: 75 gem-like tales!","Every practicing artist knows that limitations can be inspiring, and the 75 artists gathered here offer an inspirational look at what can be done in the smallest of spaces. From Spencer Holst's perfect ""Brilliant Silence"", which opens the collection, through such masterworks as Allan Gurganus's funny-yet-wrenching ""A Public Denial"" & Bernard Cooper's enigmatic ""The Hurricane Ride"", to ending with Larry Fondation's eerie ""Deportation at Breakfast"", there isn't a runt in the litter. Frequently provocative, at times hilarious, and always satisfying, you simply won't get more bang for your book dollar than this anthology. Would-be practitioners of fiction take note: here's all the textbook you'll need. It's got it all: instruction AND delight"
2,OK But Not Great,"I haven't read any of her other work, but judged as a mystery and a horse novel it was OK. I wasn't particularly impressed by the plotline as it tended to be slow in many places. The ending, however, was an excellent surprise. This isn't a bad book, but I wouldn't read it again."
5,Great!,"Well, who doesn't love Willie Nelson! I purchased this to get just one song that I could not find on any other Willie CD I have or any other CD out there - that song is 'Are You Sure' and I HAD to have it after watching one of the first episodes of 'Lost'! It's like the first or second night they're on the island and it's the closing scene song - beautiful, heartfelt song."
5,At last.,"I was most disappointed when I found I could no longer play the original game on my system and was really pleased when I saw this game for XP. I am enjoying playing it, nothing has changed and it is as much fun as the original. The only drawback is that the amounts are all in American dollars and seeing as they ship globally you would have thought there would have been a currency option. Having said that, it is still really good and I spend many happy hours in my own theme parks!"
4,A Blast to Play!,My son (14 yrs. old) has wanted this game for a long time. I was afraid I waited too long and he'd outgrown it....but he played it for hours the night it arrived. I like that he is learning as he is playing.
3,good game,"it`s a good game, at the beggining you can spend hours playing without getting tired. but after a few weeks you notice that everything is the same....you just have to build parks in different locations and give them maintenance, the same thing only different scenarios"
2,Game caused computer problems,"I installed this game on a Dell XPS running Windows XP. This game caused various applications (web browser, online game, e-mail) to freeze and need to be closed. These problems ceased when I uninstalled the game. This version of Rollercoaster Tycoon did not originally run on windows xp. Apparently there has been a fix applied to get it to run on win xp. It did not work for me."
4,Fast cheap and easy to order!!,I purchased a game for a pc. It came within three days I believe. It was fast cheap and easy to order!! I would recomend buying from this buyer!!!!
4,"Reference, not reading","Like so many other fabulous DK books, this is for reference, not for reading for hours at a time. Lovely photos, great suggested routes for driving or biking and recommendations of vinyards to visit. Take it with you when you travel, keep it with you when you decide you can't possibly leave France and settle down there for a few years..."
5,"Simple, clear steps to follow","As an active minister of a church and spiritual growth center in Southern California, I have had the opportunity to use Ms. Raiguel's book both in teaching (ministers and practitioners) and in counseling situations. The information is presented in a clear and simple way- so that topics, which might normally be a bit overwhelming within themselves, are more easily received.I recommend this book to other ministers, counselors and churches. It has become a 'must have' for me."
1,Junk from a Has Been,"The arrogant Van Preston got what she deserved. She works as a realtWHORE now selling crappy real estate around Nashville. This is what happens when you have no talent, can't play an instrument and try to BS your way into the music industry, Without studio tricks and pitch correction, her voice is horrid, off key, and strained. Her offensive song ""Toy"" is about her vibrator. It's more feminist clap trap that states who needs a man when I have my battery powered piece of plastic. Let's see if your vibrator pays you bills like a man does, MS. Preston. Anyway, there is a reason why a follow-up album was never recorded and she plays open mics in the basement in strip clubs, playing mostly to empty chairs! The reason is because her stuff is just plain awful IMO"
4,Does exactly what it's designed to do!,"I purchased this template because I needed a way to reliably and acurately draw project plans for woodworking items. Probably not what the designers had in mind, but if the shoe fits...I needed a cheap, dependable, and accurate template. This fit the bill on all requirements. I have been able to utilize the arcs on both ends of the template as well as the circles in the center. The only drawback I have noticed is that the plastic is kind of flimsy. Not terribly bad but it can move out of the way of the pencil if you put pressure on it from the wrong angle.I purchased a variety of templates from this manufacturer and they have all served me well. 'Nuff said!"
4,Works well,I bought this to have on hand for when I may need it. Have used it and is a good product.
2,Muffled,"Thought Polk would actually get a center channel right this time, so I took a chance and bought the CSi40. Muffled sound with sparse mid-to-high end sound reproduction. Terribly disappointed, especially since I wasted $... for the darn thing. Go with a Klipsch center for the type sound reproduction a center channel is supposed to provide."
5,WOW...,"IT WAS SO GOOD WATCHING THIS CONCERT, IT MADE REMEMBER A LOT OF THINGS; ALL THAT I HAVE TO SAY IT'S WOW... IT'S AMAZING, GREAT VIDEO AND THE SOUND MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CONCERT."
3,Not a high definition concert,"I got this blue-ray concert, but I was really desappointed after find out that it was recorder with digital cameras and not high definition cameras, I would had enjoy it better in high definition. Also the cameras were just focusing on Roberto Carlos all of the time when some more shots could be taken from the rest of the musicians and the audience, the backgroud was to simple. But his songs are amazing, his one of the best latin america's singers."
5,Live!,I just love this concert. He is one of my old time favorites singing all his best songs. It's a must have for spanish speaking lovers of music.
4,Beautiful photos of India,"The book shows wide and different perspectives of India. The quality of the photos is, in general, very good.It's not a book for professional or artistic photographers, but for people that are interested in having an idea of what India looks like"
5,Sturges' Continuing Family Relationship - As we grow up,"A superb example of natural people doing what comes naturally captured in a wholesome way. Through Jock Sturges' images, we see what we see around us every day - families growing older. His nudes are prime examples of beauty - of which Jock captures with a particular reverence. The subjects represent whole body acceptance - something our society lacks today. The book is well done, and the images crisp and of excellent tone."
4,Lovely Work,"Well crafted photographs of naturalists, mostly in the seemingly obligatory beach milieu. Many of the subjects are living 'the last day of summer' -- that is, the particular halcyon moment of adolescence wherein anything is possible. Yes, they are predominantly nudes, but photographed with respect and compassion. A special few are among the finest portraits I have seen, truely bringing forth the soul of both photographer and subject. My only complaint is that some of the pictures in the book inexplicably cross the fold in the binding, disrupting the image. A slightly smaller format on just one page would have been prefered."
5,"A beautiful masterwork, visually stunning and sensitive.","In ""The Last Day of Summer,"" photographer Jock Sturges brilliantly attempts to capture the emerging, radiant beauty and sexuality of adolescence. Although most of his books have been derided as ""child pornography"" by certain conservative forces here in the U.S., they most certainly are not. To fully understand his work, one must not simply look at the pictures but delve into the many articles that accompany his art in his books. These girls and boys come to Jock, year after year, with their parents' consent (and their PARENTS even pose nude with their children in many of these images). This is the epitome of TRUST between subject and artist. This is not pornography. There is no sexual intimacy portrayed anywhere. It is a celebration of the beginnings of adolescnent life...a celebration of the beauty which Nature has given. It is a return to the sensual and beautiful works of the past. -JLC, Virginia"
5,The lighting and contast of the content is excellent.,"I am a student in Canada aspiring to become a professional photograher and find Jock Sturgess,s work of supurb quality. I could only hope to achieve such personal works in my future career. I would like to know more about the author not mentioned in this hardcover or in radiant identities. Once again thanks to Jock for the quality of tasteful material in artistic expression."
5,An endearing memory restored,"Ruffian was magic to those who love racing and horses. She was the Billie Jean King of her time, good enough to beat the boys we thought until her fatal race with Foolish Pleasure. It has been 30 years since Ruffian's death, but Lyn Lifshin has reconnected across the years to make it seems like yesterday. And it's a good memory. You will smile with every page."
4,***RUFFIAN***CHAMPION FOR THE AGES***,"RUFFIAN, is truly a breath taking epic of a true champion.When we lost RUFFIAN, we lost more than just her. We lostpart of ourselves as well."
5,boxerbriefs,I love these one of my friends sugested that I get a pare. If you have not tried these you need to.
1,they look cool,I wear boxers but boxer brifes look sexer so every one start wear boxer brifes that way you wont get pantsed or get a wegie.
4,Good air cleaner,"It's obviously of higher quality than the standard air filter. Not knowing very much about air filters, I did not know that, not ititially, but eventually, when you clean it, it involves putting oil on the air filter. You can buy air filter oil for just a few dollars more but I just did not get any instructions on what is involved in cleaning the filter when it does eventually have to be cleaned.But looking at the quality of the product, I would say that it would apparantly work better than the average air cleaner."
5,I felt the moment,"Man this honestly is my favorite song i've ever heard from Eminem......you know a song is a classic when you can hear it almost three years after it's been released and still get chills hearing it.......his insight into music and the entertainment industry is intertwined perfectly with the Aerosmith sample,this song is classic.If you haven't heard it yet,you're in for a surprise."
2,This is a really poor example of Black Uhuru.,"On this DVD, the band sounds unrehearsed, and they lack the original hypnotic groove (They sound sloppy), that made the songs good in the first place. The vocals sound forced, and the sound quality... Awful!!!If you want to experience them for real, buy there cd's, (Red, Anthem, and Sensimilla) instead with the original line up."
1,Stopped working after a year,"We received this frame (the EX1011) as a gift. It worked fine for a while, but recently it stopped working. It will only stay on for a few seconds, and then it shuts itself off. I contacted Kodak, but they told me it would cost $136 to repair the frame. I would much prefer to buy a new frame that will last than to sink money into this one. Searching around online, this appears to be a common problem with Kodak frames. I will not be purchasing another Kodak frame in the future."
1,NOT LONG LASTING!!,After 15 months it stopped working! But Kodak can repair it for you.... for only $150. That's just WRONG!!
4,A good buy,I bought this for my wife so she could have nice slideshows of our son and dogs to look at while at work. The pictures look really awesome and because of the size of the frame they really stand out. Had a little bit of trouble getting the frame to sync up with my network(ended up have to reset my SAP password on Linksys) but once I got it going it worked great. We already have Kodak Easyshare on our computer so everything worked really well together. I'd definitely recommend this product.
2,Meh,"BAD- Choppy AVI playback, contrasty screen with NO shadow detail, cheap plastic feel, no random arrangement of slideshow capability, the auto-on auto-off feature would be great if it didn't turn on with the audio volume set at 60% no matter what it was set on before it turned off, no battery, cheesy slideshow transitions (no fades).GOOD- Easy setup, WIfi works with a PC (not with a mac)."
1,Beware: Not OS X MAC compatible!,"The specs say that this unit works with Macs and OS X. It doesn't. There are no driver to make the wi-fi work as it is tied to Microsoft Media Player and you can not use an IPOd as again it must be MP3 on the Windows Media Player. Kodak support was useless and they said sorry but had no downloads or help get this to work.The screen is nice but the software needs work.Also the packaging from the seller "" Ace"" was really poor, no offical Kodak box, parts just but on box, along with manuals.Maybe these are gray market goods?"
3,not ready for prime time,good screen not bad price but falls after that wireless support very week uint hangs up with too many pictures on the flash card. Forget support the take forever to answer email and when you call they just read the book then they say i guess thats a problem.their support web site is also poorsave time buy somethin elese
1,Don't buy this if you use a Mac,"Yes, that's right. Don't buy this if you use a Mac. I am not computer illiterate, but suffered several hours of frustration with this unit. Even the manual (what there is of one) gives the wrong web address for Kodak's help section for digital frames. And the updates are img file format rather than dmg. Thanks for nothing, except the hole in my budget. That's all I have to say about it."
2,Very disappointing,"Short story: this product is unreliable and annoying; it reboots every 2 or 3 hours and loses its configuration so I have to reprogram it before using it again.Long story: I was very excited about this product; I've never been willing to tolerate the housekeeping of moving pictures into a wifi card in order to view them, and knew that eventually I'd be able to pull them directly from my computer. With the release of this product I thought I'd finally be able to have things the way I want.Setting up the frame was easy. Contrary to some other reviews, it does support encrypted wireless. I was satisfied with the images.Unfortunately, in use the frame fails regularly. Every 2 or 3 hours it reboots. And when it comes up, it's lost its state (my specification of which computer to get pictures from, which pictures to show, etc). So I have to enter all that info again before the frame can go again. So, it's pretty useless. I'm hoping to return it if I can find the time."
2,Did NOT love it! Would not recommend.,"At first glance, the frame is nice looking and rather simple to use. You can play videos and display photos that you download from your camera. However, it randomly turns itself off. And after a few months of use, it has completely broken. Only random (1 of every 20 photos) will play. Otherwise the screen shows black."
2,Not a good pick!,"Just a disappointment for ease of use, especially considering it was going to an 85 year old person.It cannot be managed without a remote that is too small for anyone with vision or dexterity issues, and the commands are not intuitive.Design and features geared more for the ""thumbs"" centered culture and not for the aging.Paid too much for a used product. Makes me rethink the value of shopping with Amazon as if they are a screen for best prices and products."
4,Great Digital Frame but Wifi Not so good,The frame and everything about picture viewing works great. The Wifi just will not connect to my router. I have a Netgear and an Apple Tile Capsule with Airport built in and I can not connect to either one. Other than that its a great product.
1,"Horrible product, worse support",The EX1011 acceptance of JPEGs are random so you'll spend lots of time discarding JPEGs that won't show and you won't be able to show all the pictures you want. Support - how about chat support that averages five minutes between responses? This is probably the worse product from the least supportive company that I have ever bought. Look for another manufacturer!
1,Stay away from this product,I have had this frame for 13 months. It broke. I went to get it fixed from kodak and they told me that it is out of warranty and it would cost $150 to fix. I refused to pay them another dime and will buy another manufacturer's model for that same price.
1,WiFi functionality does not work as advertised,"It's a normal picture frame just like many other on the market, but I bought this one because of it's wireless capability. The claim is that it can be synch up with a home desktop via wifi so that it does not store any images locally but rather gets the from the desktop. THIS DOES NOT PRACTICALLY WORK! The bug is that you can make the two connect and start the slide show. However, whenever there is any minor network or a computer slowdown, that happen a couple of times a day never mind power outages, the slide show stops. The only resolution is restarting the show manually. There is no automatic restarting of the show. Unless you want to be restarting the show several times a day wait till this product matures."
1,AVOID -- Kodak online policies changed,"I purchased the EX-1011 as a great way to share photos with my family and friends. I bought two frames for my parents and my wife's parents. After spending $600 (they were more expensive in Dec08) Kodak is now changing their online policy -- now they require a regular photo printing purchase or they will delete the photos in your gallery.Kodak, are you kidding me? I spend $600 and then you try to nickle and dime me out of more money with a blanket policy.If you're buying this for online sharing (and why else would you pay this much for a frame) then I'd look elsewhere. Who knows what the next policy change will bring."
2,WiFi is subpar,"I like the picture frame but the WiFi doesn't work well. It works but not like they lead you to believe if you want to run pics directly from your computer. In that mode the scheduler doesn't work, the sorting or random play doesn't work(you will always see the oldest pictures first and follow in chronilogical order) and and frame will lock up often if it doesn't like a pic. Overall very poor firmware. Support said they are releasing an update soon, but who wants to wait and who knows if it will be better. So I returned it."
4,"Much better than lower quality, cheaper frames - you get what you pay for.",We have been very happy with this product. The image quality is fantastic and the menus are very easy to navigate. The ideal purchase price for this is less than $250 (if you can get it for around $200 - you are getting a real steal).Just a couple of things:(1) The wireless does not integrate with Apple computers (Windows only).(2) It does not work with the newer HC-SD cards.Well worth the investment as it is much better quality than similar sized frames by other companies.
4,"Great Product, BUT","This is really a great gift for people who LOVE to take photographs all the time! However, Wal-Mart sells it for $179.99. I wanted, for convenience, to buy it here, but for $30 savings I was willing to run out to the local Wal-Mart!"
1,Lousy photo frame,"I bought the kodak EX-1011 digital picture frame for its size and the wireless capability. I am greatly desapointed.The software install crashed my computer and I spent 2 days recovering from it. Luckily I have a good backup system. I finally downloaded the kodak Easyshare application from kodak.com and install just that.The frame turn on and off by itself few times during the day. I guess it respond the tv or stereo remote control .You could copy picture to your frame only by sharing them through microsoft media player... And even that is painfully arcane.The frame crashed and rebooted twice when I select many pictures at the same time.There is no way to push the picture from your PC to the frame directly. You have to select the picture through the frame remote control then copy them, again using the control.The picture quality is bad and the viewing angle terrible.And yes I updated the frame to the latest firmware!Not a product I recommand...."
4,Cool!,"Very cool, great picture. Not super user-friendly... well my mom hasn't figured out how to really use it yet. But great product!"
2,Don't buy it yet. The product is not mature and support ... none,"I bought an 8-inch model a month ago and like the photo slide show. But it does not play AVI video as it claims. After I found out that was last year model, I returned it and ordered the EX-1011 from Amerson. EX-1011 has a bigger screen, and that's all the good news. The features that I like in the old model (dissolve in/out slide transition and random slide play) are not in this new model. The slide shows photos in the same order every time. It gets boring after a few showing.It still does not play AVI video. I emailed Kodak technical support. They suggest I try with a new memory card, try with a different camera, try ... I finally attached the video file with my reponse back and never heard from Kodak's technical support again.I didn't bother to try the wireless function after I read the negative comments. It is a pity, EX-1011 has a nice screen. I will wait until Kodak fixes the bugs."
2,Great frame but the wireless capability is VERY week.,"Great frame. Great picture. The wifi set up never worked and contacting Kodak for help or information is useless. I emailed them a very specific tech question on set up and on how long can I keep the frame runnig, and they sent me a link from the Kodak page that doesn't answer the questions. They say that they will contact you in 24-48 hours, but both times it took over 5 days. To use the wifi they suggest being in the same room with your wifi. If I was in the same room, I would run a cord!Picture quality and look of frame- great! Wireless capability and Kodak help- poor. Will update information when/if Kodak will contact me."
1,Broken,"Very hard to read, many broken thoughts, for what I read.Does she have a Web address or audio version?"
5,Kenny is a real kid pleaser!,"Ok, it would seem that a story about a girl who keeps a pet shark in her home would be just too much, but hey, it works! My kids love Kenny. He's a smart mouth, he loves being pampered and walks on his back fins...just too cute! I actually haven't met a kid who doesn't like Kenny. If you are looking for a gift for any kid ages 4-8 or 9...Kenny might just fit the bill."
1,an outdated priest looks at his outdated church,"When this book was written in the 1960's, Father Kavanaugh may have had some meaningful criticsms. Forty years later, it just sounds bitter and ineffectual. I bought this book for research for my own forthcoming ""A Returned Catholic Looks at His Church"", but it is utterly unusable. Instead of serious discussion of Jesus's (or St. Thomas's or St. Augustine's)written and oral statements about clerical celibacy, divorce, abortion, war, capital punishment, our responsibilities to the poor, sick or weak among us and a myriad of other important issues, Father Kavanaugh resorts to lame caricatures of Catholics who find no solace in the Church but find great warmth and understanding in Kavanaugh. A good subtitle for this book would have been ""examples of why I, father Kavanaugh, am good and Godlike, while the Church stinks to hell"". Sorry, I wish I could be more positive. I wanted very much for this book to say something valuable, but it failed."
4,The beat that fell unto perfection,"Spaced between a somber album and world money maker, this album proves that the playing of Philip Gould was much like the force that keeps matter together.Each member plays well and the musicianship is very good for a live performance. But the crown jewel belongs to Hong Kong native, Philip Gould, who plays with a control and vibrancy that few could ever emulate and no one could ever match.No candle burns forever, but the light that burned off of Philip's playing on this CD shines with every revolution inside my CD player...He is just that good."
3,Wrong Planet!,"I was excited to find this item on Amazon. Too bad it had nothing to do with Uranus at all. The entire DVD was devoted to Voyager II's encounter with Saturn. While that was very interesting, this was not as advertised. That and the DVD was all of 27 mins long. Beware."
3,Mediocre Fare,"This was not one of Ms. Napier's best efforts. As always, the romance between the two characters sizzle, but I guess the characters didn't get to me as much as they do in some of her other books. I didn't really like Anya all that much and I felt that the back story with Scott's daughter was more annoying than touching or anything. I liked the girl fine, but it felt weird to be reading about it. It didn't flow very well with the story. It's an OK read, but nothing I'd spend too much money on."
1,not as good as the picture,"they look great, but it is just looking, the size and the material are not as good as I spected"
3,Tiesto asia tour,The dvd shows Tiesto and his band travel around Asia -- so while you do see some of the clubs he performs at -- you get to see what the hotel rooms he stays at... inside and outside... even on a beach stay.I liked the look of the city - the various asia people at the clubs
2,Unsatisfied,"I thought that this DVD was a show, or several parts of shows around Asia, but it is only a documentary about the tour... Very Unsatisfied!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"This is one of the most touching books I have ever read. As a mother of two girls, this book teaches them that they are special and created by God. It teaches them that it doesn't matter what others may think of them, God will always love them and that they belong to him. I have used this each year in my 2nd grade Sunday School class to teach the children about how much God loves them and that he created each of them to be different and beautiful inside and out! Lucado is fantastic!"
5,Great for children and adults.,"The pictures are great, and my daughter seems to really enjoy them. The story is heartwarming, teaches an important lesson, and speaks to members of any audience."
5,Awesome blessing for my children and granddaughter,"I know so many adults who have been blessed by this book's message; PLUS many of my own children, my granddaughter and the nephews that I have shared it with. And of course, God blessed me with it first. Thank you Jesus!!"
5,Love this book,There is not one time when I read this book that I don't cry. It is a great reminder that God loves us for who we are. My children also love it and we pull it out and read it whenever they have self-steem issues. Thank you Max Lucado for this wonderful book!
5,You Are Special,"You Are Special is a very special book. It helps children to adults learn to deal with hurtful words and actions. It will help you realize that you are special just the way you were created. Because, God doesn't make mistakes."
5,A beautiful story about how to trust God's love for us.,It is a wonderful illustration of our special relationship to our Creator. It touches and reaches the hearts of many who are hurt by the hurtful marks of others. It truly depicts a perception of how God our Creator loves and cares for His own.
2,Teeny Tiny Book,"Be careful when ordering this book, it is very very small. I was stunned when my order arrived as I had bought this book before (not from Amazon) and it was a big and beautiful children's book. This version is way smaller than what I was anticipating and hoping for. On the other hand it is the perfect little size to slip into a Christmas stocking or use as a package decoration. But I will be returning it myself."
5,It touch my heart.,"This book was great. My children truly enjoyed it , we cried. It truly made me stop and think about how I am living my life. I will give it often as a gift. Food for thought."
5,"Powerful message leads all people back to thier ""First Love""","How wonderful for the wandering heart to know that he/she is made for a purpose. My Son and his wife were missionaries to China for two years and they gave this wonderful book out to the village people on a daily basis. It's these kinds of literary works that pave the way for the true ""Peace that Passeth all Understanding"". Author/Illustrator"
5,Must Read,"This is an awesome book written by Max that is heart felting and reminds me that my imperfections are really God's prefect design for me. I currently own five of his books including ""You Are Mine"", ""Because I Love You"", ""Just The Way You Are""(which made me cry!), ""Tell Me The Story"", and ""Tell Me The Secrets"". Yes, I am a big fan of his children's books and it all began with the first book of his I've ever read ""You Are Special"". I was touched ever since and it touched my students, my husband and every other person I'd share it with. The best part of owning these books is that I get to share them with everyone I know. As a teacher I enjoy reading these inspirational stories that share the messages of hope and love. Best of all, it really doesn't matter what religion, age, sex you are to enjoy these books. Once you get one, you'll probably want them all!"
1,Disappointed,The download does not have any pictures (only words). Love the story. Just not the same without pictures - sad about it.
4,I loved this book as a child!,"This book always made me feel good when I was little. I bought it for my daughter for her to enjoy too. This book does have a very strong religious underlying theme. Even though we are a pretty unreligious family, we still enjoy the book."
5,Touching,"I am a school counselor at a parochial school and am reading this to all my K-5 students as an end-of-the-year message. They ALL are ""getting"" the message that Max Lucado is trying to send - love and care for one another without judgment for only our God is qualified for such a task."
5,Can even teach us old college students something,"as a senior in college, I first heard this book read to us at Prime Time christian fellowship at my university. there was not a dry eye in the house, this lesson needs to be taught to everyone. excellent book."
5,Amazing,"this book is so precious. i think it makes you look at how you look at people sometimes by judging them. this is a perfect children's book because it teaches kids to not only not judge people by their cover, but also they shouldn't worry about what they look like to others. be yourself."
5,Confidence Builder,This book has a wonderful message from God for children in a delightful story. It's a real confidence builder by teaching children to be themselves and receive unconditional love. I hope all children have a chance to hear or read it and never let the dots or stars stick!
5,A great reminder of whose opinion really matters!,"Max Lucado does a super job of reminding the reader of whose opinion really matters in this life. The Wemmicks just don't seem to know better. They go around deciding who's special and who's not by the clothes they wear or the words they speak or even if someone else thinks they're special. Fortunately for Punchinello, Lucia has already gotten to know her maker, the woodcarver Eli, and she knows the secret to happiness in life. Lucia points Punchinello in the right direction and in the process reminds the reader to not always be so caught up in what other's think but instead to think about what God thinks . . He created us . . It's His opinion that matters. Great book but not just for kids. Adults are really the ones it's written for, if you ask me!"
1,"Buy the paperback version, not the hardcover","My best friend has this book for her children and I loved it. I wanted to buy two copies, one for my children, the other for my son's preschool teacher. When they arrived I was MORE than disappointed. In this smaller format, it loses ALL of its charm as a children's book. 48 pages?!?!?! It's wordy enough and can be difficult to keep a small child's interest, but in the format of a young reader's book, it's near impossible. Could not be more disappointed to wait for this book to arrive and receive this nonsense in its stead. It should be mentioned further up in its description that it is small and not a charming picture book like its paperback counterpart. When you purchase a hardcover book, you expect it to be as good, if not better, than it is in paperback and more durable, you do not expect it to have most of its illustrations taken away and have it be 48 pages of young reader material."
1,Doesn't belong in a public school,I was pretty surprised when my daughter brought this book home as homework. It's a thinly-veiled attempt to push the creationist agenda and shouldn't be anywhere near a public school.
1,It's a picture book - Where are the pictures?,This is a kid's picture book but no pictures downloaded to my Kindle. I only got the words.I got a refund.
2,Size was small,"I have one of these stories and love it. I wanted a storyboard book that I could use in teaching a class of preschoolers. I was surprised when it came and it is a tiny little storyboard book. I probably didn't read the description well enough. Oh well, still love the story."
5,excellent product!,"LOVE this book - perfect gift for an adult or a child - beautiful pictures and wonderful, meaningful story."
5,A Wonderful Book,"My mom found this bood my senior year of highschool. She brought it home and we curled up on the couch as she read it to me. We were both almost in tears by the end. Even though this is a children's book, she gave me a copy for graduation, I've brought it to college and let my friends read it. It is a wonderful book for anyone of any age who at some point has felt like they are not important. Ever felt like that? I know this book has been an insparation to me many times."
4,Not a bad read,"Honestly, I read this book. I felt it was very down to earth and a very easy read. Zach does his best to make incomming freshmen at ease with their transition into college life. For the most part it is humorous and has enough wit to keep most readers interested.I will say that it doesn't give the most complete look at college life. In order to impart your college freshman with a complete point-of-view of the college experience I recommend (in addition to this book):Been There, Should've Done That II : More Tips for Making the Most of College by Suzette Tylor. (ISBN: 0965608611 ) Decent advice, and a quick read.College 101 : The Book Your College Does Not Want You To Read (ISBN: 0966412206 ) by Guy Stevens. The advice is spot on and any book hated by college administrations can't be all bad! Also some of the stories are pretty classic."
4,Great Alternative to Water Delivery - Save $$$,"Once I realized how much I was spending on bottled water delivery, since the prices had risen along with the price of the gas it takes to deliver them, I knew there had to be a better solution, both for my bank account and for the environment. And this PUR water bottle is the solution. It will last for up to a whole year (with the included filters) and it costs less than what I spent in one month on delivery bottled water. And the water tastes great. Even better, not only am I doing something good for my body, I'm doing something good for the environment by not buying bottled water that burns tons of diesel fuel being delivered all over the city. Municipal water systems are far and away the cheapest and most environmentally-friendly way to get your fresh water, and with the PUR water bottle, it will have the purity and taste you expect from a delivery bottle. This product is a win/win solution."
1,BAD SELLER,"The seller claims, ""Each Filter cleans 320 gallons of water, lasts through approx. 1 year of regular family use""; however, the filters last 1-2 months and filter 151 Liters. I wouldn't have bought this if I knew it lasted 1-2 months AND the replacement filters aren't manufactured anymore."
3,The filters are still made,"The filters used for this product are the same standard 2 stage filters (PURCRF950L1) that are used for other Pur filtration systems. I do not have this product but I use these filters in a 2 gallon ""Pur water dispenser"" and have been using the dispenser for 7 years now."
1,Don't Buy This,"This product is great, but unfortunately it has been discontinued by Pur since last year. You are going to have a hell of a time finding replacement filters. Even Proctor and Gamble does not make them anymore. They have some in stock that they ship out as a courtesy if customers complain enough about it. But good luck finding replacement filters."
3,"Easy to use, yes! Pure water, not so sure.","I purchased the Pure Water Bottle about a month ago for use at home with a cooler. It was really easy to prep and setup. I have used Brita filters before and this is pretty much the same thing.I dont think the water ""tastes"" the same as the bottled water I am used to at work. It has funny after-taste. I'm not sure if this is due to the Pure Water Bottle or the new cooler I bought at the same time from Amazon (made by Pioneer)."
1,Knock Off stay away!,I just received this Apple knockoff from SF Planet. The advertisement was for an Apple data cable not an Apple compatible data cable. This is a false advertisement and a scam!!
5,Pick this up if you have an iPod and are a road warrior,"I bought this cable to not only charge my laptop on the road (with the AC adapter) but to sync mp3s to my laptop (which only has USB 2.0). You would probably be best off with a second cable (since the Firewire->Dock connector cable is attached at my home computer) if you don't want to unplug and replug in every time you go out on the road. This is the same price as the Firewire->Dock connector cable, so you might as well get the included USB 2.0 cable too."
1,NOT BY APPLE!!!!!!,"I wanted an original apple usb cord for my iPod, and the description said this is, but it isn't. So if you're like me and you want the original, don't buy this one."
1,Not an authentic apple product.,"I ordered one of these, and it wasn't an authentic Apple product. How can I tell? The usual slogan written on authentic Apple iPod products goes like this: Designed by Apple in California Assembled in China *The fake cable, purchased here, doesn't have this printed on it.Don't buy. Not ""100% genuine Apple item"" as advertised."
4,Ipod Data Cable,"It works well, problem is that you don't always have a computer to use to charge your ipod."
4,Will not charge 3G iPod via USB alone,"I am reasonably sure this cable will NOT charge an iPod unless the firewire portion is plugged into the iPod power supply. USB only delivers 5V, and the iPods this cable fits needed 12V to charge (Firewire). So don't buy it if you think you'll be able to travel without the iPod power supply as well as the cable."
2,Frustrating,"I live in England and finally picked up a 20gb ipod the other day. I got home all eager to get my songs on there and then realised my home PC doesnt have firewire, which i thought it might as it is only a year old.So, i had to go on amazon and buy the USB 2.0 cable which im hoping comes tomorrow. I wish Apple would make it more clear that those with a PC may need this cable, as i was left in the dark. I paid 300 for my ipod, the least they can do is tell me about the cable, if not throw it in for free."
3,questions,"I am in the process of buying an ipod, but very confused. First off I understand the ipod mini comes with a USB cable in the box, cause that's what it says. Wouldn't that be all you need to connect your ipod to your PC, having you do own a PC & not a MAC? and second I am kinda confused with the word ""Dock Connector"". Is the word dock connector referring to the bottom of the Ipod Mini, or is it a whole different type of adapter one needs to be able to hook up the USB cord from the ipod to the computer. Thanks."
3,not quite,"This recording is in 1978, and Sutherland just a bit past her amazing prime as the greatest coloratura soprano of our time, plus she was having a bad day. The high notes not brilliant, and ""Casta Diva"" is shaky and off key, and sounded pushed, much like Callas...instead buy the diva's 1964 Norma released by decca with Marilyn Horne as her equal partner."
3,"Not bad, but not her best","This Norma is slightly better than the 1981 version, but far worst than her live recording and her 1964 studio recording with Horne.This was an off day if this recording was recorded in 1978 as it said on the cover of my copy. The casta diva was droopy and pushed. The high notes not quite secure. The coloratura not accurate. It's not bad though, but not a hit.However, if you want to hear La Stupenda when she was the reigning queen of bel canto, I would recommend the follow VHS tapes. The singing in those are magnificent.The ""Voice of Firestone"" The ""Bell Telephone Hour"" The ""Age of bel canto"""
5,absolutly fab,"Norma is my favourite opera together with lucia di lammermoor with Dame Joan Sutherland in the title roles and this dvd is great, i'm totally happy with it"
3,Great Singing Very Poor Sound Quality,"I am surprised this DVD was ever released with such poor sound quality. As another reviewer or two mentioned, the sound fades in and out and there are times when you cannot hear Joan Sutherland's voice unless you wind up the volume only to be blasted backwards a few bars later when she sings loudly. It totally distracts from the listening and viewing experience. That said, Sutherland is in fine form, even if not her greatest Norma. Its a shame this opera is not performed more often as it has a lot of wonderful music. Elkins is an excellent singing partner with Sutherland and overall the cast is quite strong. My advice is dont buy this DVD UNLESS you are a BIG Sutherland fan, which will enable you to override the frustration with the sound and enjoy her performance."
3,LEM,"This is a good pictorial history of the development of an amazing flying machine. I would have liked more text as the only writing is captions on each photo, some of which have not been well edited. If you want to know more about the technical side of Apollo read 'Apollo' by Charles Murray and Catherine Bly Cox."
4,Moonships,I liked this book. It had a lot of pictures I've never seen before and went into the places at Grumman that you never see in other places.
3,"A disappointing book, but all in all nice to have","When I received this book I was disappointed. I really expected something else.I wanted a well documented manual digging into the ""behind the scene"" of such an enterprise of building a LEM.Instead, all I got was a booklet of pictures with notes. Not a single story, not a single tale or interview, nothing written.It's just a collection of pictures, period.Then after someway I changed my mind because those pictures are something rare, but I don't think this book is indispensable. Eventually is a nice to have book, but it costs too much for what you get.What's more, some of those pictures are not fine printed (you'll see picture boundaries cut off at the borders of the page et similia).All in all there's nothing much to say: if you want a series of (rare and good) black and white pics about the LEM construction and concept, each one coupled with a brief note about the image, and you think the price is fine for you, go for it."
5,Soapbox The Bahama Basic Bag - Black,"I love this little bag! Looks a bit like a purse, so it's discreet to carry anywhere you need it. I carry all of my stage makeup with me in this. All the little straps hold everything in place perfectly. Even loaded up with Ben Nye, eyeliner pencils, cleanser, baby wipes, and a hairbrush, there is plenty of room for a can of hairspray, a few highlighters, and a well worn script. This is pretty much all I take to the theatre with me performance days. Plus, if something gets spilled on the outside, just wipe it down with a wet cloth and it is good as new. Fantastic bag! You won't be disappointed."
3,OK Older Printer Fit My Needs,"I purchased this old style printer because it matches equipment that I already have. It seems to work OK. It did not come with a power cord though, which I thought was odd. I should be able to find one at Radio Shack."
4,Well worth the time,"The first act is excellent! The second a little less so, but still good. I wouldn't necessarily purchase it, but if you can find it at a library definatly watch it!"
2,Works great for several months,"We have gone through two of these in the past year. Works great for a while, and then it dies an ugly death. Hi, Blair. Hopefully we will be able to get them fixed under warranty."
3,Good - No problems but ...,I've just bought a 10X20 Chromakey Backdrop. Everything was OK in the payment and shipping process but the product arrived with wrinkles because the the folds.
1,NO RAW SUPPORT,"No RAW file support. I was told by a coworker that these are great storage devices for a DSLR but if you shoot in RAW you are out of luck. Now I'm looking in to Epson P-3000, P-4000, P-5000 units because they have RAW support as well all the other functions of this unit (as I can tell). Perhaps these devices just serve different purposes. This seems to be marketed as a portable media player whereas the Epson units will play video, audio/mp3, and store photos but aren't marketed as mobile DVRs."
3,Archos 504 mp3 player battery life sucks!,"After returning my first Archos 504 to Amazon.....Whose customer service was GREAT!! They sent me the replacement even before I returned the first one...The battery life on this thing is very poor. It will barely last on a flight from Atlanta to Fresno. I like the player OK, bulky though, but the battery is not good at all."
1,Archos 504 : buyers beware !,"I have had Archos 504 for one week . Here's what I have to say about this product :The Goods : solid built , easy to operate ,good screen and colors .The not so goods : customer support is very questionable , can not buy additional battery , cannot play many popular video formats without extra spending ( currently $ 40 ) and I have waited for 3 days but not yet received the activation code via internet download ( I wonder why it takes so long ? ).In all , there are other products on the market with quite better performance and features that one should check out before buying this Archos . I am somewhat frustrated and probably return this product ."
1,not just anyone can work it.,The archos unit is very hard to operate and tech ser are not very helpful when you need them.
4,Archos 504,This product is little bulky but has a bigger screen than a ipodIt doesn't have Wi-Fi nor a browser so you cannot connect to the web which is necessary for downloading online content. We need a optional DVR station to connect and record TV programs.
4,Worked well for two years,I loved my archos 504. it worked excellent for two years til i dropped it and the screen cracked. the only problem i had besides this is that i had to hunt down a update file on archos website when my player froze on me.
1,Horrible customer service,"If you ever have to talk to the archos customer service, and you will, because this product will break good luck. I have never dealt with more incompetent and un-professional people ever in my life. I had the 504. Everytime you touch this product it sends a shock through body of the unit causing it to reset, shock it enough times by merely touching it, and then you have to try to get the product fixed. Archos will tell you that they'll fix it, which then you waste more money shipping it to them, just to have them turn around and try to charge you more money. Sorry, but I already spent enough money on a media player that worked for three months, why would I want to pay another $250 for another 2-3 months of glitchy frustration? Long story short, avoid this company, there are many other manufacturers of media players."
4,"Amazing, but.....","Amazing picture and video quality.needs plug-in for certain video format ($20).Sound quality above average but not as good as the Gmini-120.slow charge time unless you buy the power supply, an irritating way of Archos to make more money.the device is slow to load, but hey it is not a PC.Battery life is ok, need additional battery if you want to watch movies on long flights ;-)80Gb is a dream volume, much better than 20Gb I had in Gmini-120.can't think of a better player, much better than iPod, but Archos was very nasty having people have to buy plug-ins and a charger."
4,Good product.,"I like the 504, but It has a few disappointing issues with it:1. Takes a while to start up.2. If it starts to play a corrupted file, unit will cut off and restart.3. Controls, while adequate, could be arranged a little better.4. Archos ""nickel and dimes"" you by making you purchase everything separately.5. Built in speaker useless, unless you're in a quiet room.On the upside:1. Display is large and bright.2. Lot's of storage space.3. Plays lots of formats4. Good battery life. Got 9-11 hours playing music.5. lots of accessories."
2,good product-lousy service,"this unit performs well when it's new, but God helphelp you if it needs repairs . Two hours on the phone,5 representatives later, they said the LCD had frame damage from an impact(lies) and not covered under warranty. The unit was only 9 months old.They offered to give me a $30 discount towards a new one, but you'll still have to deal with the same old company.DON'T BUY IT!!"
5,Archos - LOVE IT!,"After purchasing 2 other players to record movies on for a trip i'm taking, i was really disappointed. I asked my ""computer guru"" what he recommended and he told me Archos. He was right! I got the 80 gig and have about 10 full length movies already saved on it for vacation. It's easy to download to, just drag and drop. Picture quality is great, sound great! i don't use it for music at all, only movies and it certainly does what i need it to do."
2,Not Compatible for Pocketdish,"Unfortunately I when I put searched ""pocketdish"" on the Amazon website, this product came up leading me to believe that this was compatible with my dishnetwork DVR -- it is not. I am sure it is a great product, but not at all what I was looking for."
3,Archos 504 80GB,"Screen gets 5 stars, awesome picturehad to pay more money to get access to all video codes's, but at least xvid & divx are supported with no conversionsoftware interface gets only 2 stars - Archos needs some major work here. If you're going to offer a player with such a large HD, the SW shold make it easier to manage a huge file collection.Have had to reset & re-download all files a couple of times, as the unit locks up.If this didn't have such an awesome screen & requires no conversion for divx & xvid, I would have returned it. If apple get's the ipod touch up to this file capacity, I will likely change. Wife love's her 32G version....The software, the screen, & the intuitive interface are plain awesome on the ipod touch."
4,fantastic,"Have used it on a few trips now. Crystal clear screen.Get the battery adapter, which comes with the AV lead to plug in to a TV when on holiday. You can't plug the AV lead in to the unit itself. If you do that, it tell you to buy the batter (or av) adapter!Have to pay for plugins like browser and to view DVD VOBs, which is a bit of a rip (especially for the browser!!! Can understand if you have to pay extra for licence fees for VOBs).Overall though, awesome bit of kit, love it."
2,Nickel and dime stuff hurt a good product,"The basic unit is pretty good, but after downloading the first movie to the unit I get an error message that it does not play MPEG-4 movies without the optional plug-in, even though it is stated through the ads it plays MPEG-4. Well the MPEG-4 plugin is a additional cost item, as is the AC power supply. These are items that come free with almost any other player. I called Archos about this and they replied "" we did not say you wouldn't need an optional for cost plug-in"". Questionable ethical attitudes like this and their nickel and dime philosphy is often what makes or sinks a company. Right now I would say Archos is a sinker, even if they have a descent product."
2,Sheesh...,"Sure, this song helped sell a few thousand shoes, but it's really not that appealing. Listen to the chorus: ""Give me two pur (pair)/I need two pur/So I can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones."" (*sigh*) Maybe Nelly was trying to create another ""My Adidas"" or something. And another thing, there's nothing worse than when a wack rapper has his even wacker crew on a song, so that's another downfall. This song IS better than ""Pimp Juice"", but that's not hard to do.Anthony Rupert"
4,A nice and simple album,"Corea and Hampton belong to different generations. But his album bring us a very emotive and sensible jazz cooperation. One can easily recognize Hampton`s joy and bliss while playing with Corea, and things really work between them. Corea, in a good moment, plays a brilliant interpretation in FIESTA, coming back to his hispanic origins.Despite this is not a cult album, it has a very interesting cost-effectiveness ratio, and hour of pure happy jazz is achieved.Roberto Teixeira, PhD, Sao Paulo, Brazil"
2,An extraordinary experience,"Corea is one of the most interesting piano players nowadays. This meeting with Hampton is something. The energy that comes from the tension between two generations is amazing.The old ""homecoming"" Hampton style mixed with the extraordinary technique of Corea bring an irresistible balance and swing.Sea Breeze is a tune that celebrates the joy of beeing alive and breathing. It is gorgeous in its simplicity and joy. One can perfectly feel the happyness on Hampton's performance as he scats along the melody. Corea develops a interesting solo sometimes runnig for and to Hampton, Hampton travels in his solos to and forth Corea, and then finally they meet in a chorus that concludes in joy. A remarkable recording."
1,Extremely poor service in every aspect of the vendor to customer relationship,"46 days after the order ""shipped"" and I have still not received the book. I have emailed them repeatedly, and only get form email responses. I will never use these people again, and would recommend that no one purchase any products from this vendor."
5,Haaaiiiiiiilllllllll to the chief.,"Note to Dr. Weil : Although you suggest Osteopathy and Rolfing for certain conditions I think you may be underprescribing them. Without exception, they would be beneficial to anyone regardless of their health and have yet to receive their full appreciation by the medical community. Contact averbic@aol.com if you need the opinion of someone who has experienced the above therapies or help promoting them.To negative reviewers: You didn't read the book, manage to absorb it properly, or suffer from obsessive skeptic disorder(OSD). Try Ginkgo for concentration."
3,shipping,"book was wrapped in xmas paper, which didn't survive postal services so it took a long time to receive due to poor shipping method."
1,Don't consult this book!,"Not too long ago Mr. Weil appeared on a television show giving healthy eating tips. It was apparent that Mr.Weil was carrying lots of extra weight while the interviewers were trim. Wake up America, this guy is bogus. This book is especially riddled with bad advice. He totally denigrates any weight-lifting (crucial for women to elevate their metabolism and ensure healthy bone mass). He also advocates trimming your protein consumption to a bare minimum. Current wisdom is shifting to the value of good supplies of low-fat protein. Don't buy this book."
5,pleased customer,I am a pleased customer.I would use this supplier again.The book came before it was expected and in better condtion than described.
4,Practical Guide to Health,"This book is practical, it isn't overly critical and it practical for Americans to follow, while keeping all of the key points to good health in it. It supports some harmful conventional drugs in small areas such as Acne, which he supports accutane, but hey you can't kill them all, especially coming for an M.D rather than Holistic Practitioner. Great Book."
1,Not worth the read,"I received this book for Christmas one year along with a few others and this one was a dissapointment. First of all, if you're already a pretty healthy person with some knowledge of how to eat right and take care of yourself then much of the information won't be new to you. I found myself skipping ahead a lot for that reason. He also has a very narrow minded viewpoint and like another reviewer mentioned, he's not really much better than your typical allopathic doctor. It seems he's just cashing in on the trend of people interested in a more natural life style.I could find a lot of faults with this book but what I particularly didn't like was his dismissal of a lot of diseases as ""faddish"", and his complete dismissal of coconut oil which is actually very good for you. A much better book in the same vein is the ""Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine"" which I received at the same time and would highly recommend."
4,Good resource on natural health,"When I first read this book, I knew little about natural medicine. Now I keep it as a handy resource for its valuable information on preventing common diseases and natural solutions to common problems. The ideas in this book have reformed my view of health entirely, and I have much more control over my health now than ever before. My only fault is that Dr. Weil often relies heavily on his own experiences and can be very opinionated at times. But overall, this is an excellent introduction to the field of alternative medicine."
4,Refreshing and Informative,"This book is a great resource for everyone looking to empower themselves in their health and wellbeing! I have recommended this book to many of my patients and I find Dr. Weil's perspective on integrative medicine both refreshing and inspiring!Giovanna Capozza DHMHS, RHN, RhAHomeopathic Doctor, Holistic Nutritionist[...]"
3,We're all going to die!!,"I'm considered by others to be pretty up (and fairly fanatical) on health issues, though I do go for the occasional bag of chips. This book made me feel like a downright slacker! It also strikes me as being very, well, of the American culture of fear. Everything is terrible and going to kill you. The air you breathe, the chemicals on everything... you should bathe in filtered water?? Come on!We all know it's not an ideal world, but this book will have anyone taking it too seriously in a real tizzy as you can't do a thing without causing yourself and those you love some grievous bodily harm.It's interesting, but take it with a grain of salt. Oh wait-- NOT SALT!!"
5,Good Advice If Used Properly,"Dr. Weil has always given good advice. Alot of it is common sense, which is in short supply nowadays.I would like to comment on others that have said that Dr. Weil is against weight lifting. This is 100% untrue. He is not against weight lifting or strength training. He disagrees with bodybuilding to the extent that it's more about appearance than health. He states in his book that women who do weight-bearing exercises have better protection against calcium loss and osteoporosis and have increased metabolism.There is no author/doctor that you should blindly follow. Do your own homework and use peoples' advice where it best fits your own situation. Read a variety of authors such as Dr. Weil, Gary Null and others. Learn about your own situation and what would be best for you to do. Sometimes natural health is the way to go and sometimes you need a conventional doctor. Even Dr. Weil will tell you that! :)"
4,Great Live Set,"So here we have a reissue of Gord's only live album ""Sunday Concert"". The album itself has always been a treat and really shows you a taste of an early live set. Not a bad point here at all. The bonus tracks are treats as well. The cover of Dylan's ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"" is exquisite (and not available anywhere else for you completists). Definitely worth a spin."
5,A great live recording of Gordon,"Although I don't have this pressing of ""Sunday Concert"" I do have the EMI ""Acoustic Highway"" CD from 1996 of this album and the liner notes on that pressing are great, the sound is great on the album, and it features Gordon performing a sampling of his ""best"" early songs and it features a few great songs that are not on the ""UA Collection"" including ""Ballad of Yarmouth Castle,"" ""Leaves of Grass,"" ""Lost Children,"" and ""In a Windowpane."" This collection does also introduce 2 songs he did record separately originally in a medley which he did later record in the studio in 1975 for ""Gord's Gold"" for ""I'm Not Sayin'"" and ""Ribbon of Darkness."" If you actually have this pressing, you may or may not enjoy the bonus tracks that appear on this issue."
4,an excellent continuation from a fantastic choral group,"I purchased Cynara after buying almost all the previous Anuna albums. It is one of the best of their recordings so far in sound quality and instrumentation, and the re-arrangement of Christus 2000 is especially powerful. The album ""Omnis"", because of its lush vocals, and the specially ordered orchestrated ""Behind the Closed Eye"" are my personal Anuna favorites, but this album shows just how beautiful the group sounds. They can perform in many different styles, songs written or arranged by the leader M. McGlynn, ranging in period from the 12th century all the way to the twenty-first."
5,the best of the best,"For all of you Anuna fans out there, this is one CD that you DON'T want to leave out of your collection. I'm up to six Anuna CDs now, and I can honestly say that this is their best work. Omnis, Invocation, and Anuna 2002 come close, but this one takes the cake. Congrats to Michael and crew for another wonderful masterpiece!!"
5,Great James Garner Movie,I don't think James Garner ever made a bad movie. This is an excellent comedy western. You won't be disappointed.
4,Fun 70's western,James Garner mugs his way through this amusing western. His personal appeal carries this comedy. Its a familliar character for Garner (the Handsome self centered con man full of wise cracks but always the good guy). For all james garner fans its a must see also check out Support your local sherrif (the sequal).
2,Silly Western Movie,This movie was somewhat entertaining for an hour or so. At some point it took a turn and went from entertaining to goofy. Like watching Tom and Jerry. Disappointing is the word I would use. If you like the goofy stuff then you may like this movie.
2,Low-grade western farce,"This is a farce made as a followup to a fantastic western farce, Support Your Local Sheriff. The plot in this film is weak and gets its laughs from a few lame gags. Harry Morgan is not up to form in this film. The whole film seems poorly written and made in slipshod fashion."
2,Don't waste your money,"If you're looking for a clean, funny family-friendly movie along the lines of Garner's Maverick episodes, this isn't it.I'm frankly quite surprised that this is a G-rated film. Families should be aware that there is quite a lot of language in this movie. D--- and h--- are sprinkled liberally throughout. Add it to the innuendos and the riotous dance hall girls and you've got a movie that should be at least a PG.The film has a few humorous moments, such as when Garner's sidekick assumes the tough steely-eyed persona of the famous gunslinger Garner finagles him into impersonating. However, these bits of laughter aren't enough to relieve the monotony of the plot. Overall, this film is simply not as clever or entertaining as many of Garner's other appearances. And the gun-slinging pants-wearing wildcat tomboy heroine is really overdone and annoying. :DSave your money for something else."
4,Entertaining,"One reviewer said he had to ""turn it off after the first five minutes because of nonstop profanity."" I thought ""Well yeah that can spoil a good movie"" but I'll give it a try & see. Didn't hear a word of profanity in the whole movie & it was almost a 5 star entertainer - but not quite. Highly recommended!"
1,Support your local Gunfighter,I can't give a review on this movie because I still haven't received it yet. Can someone please let me know when I might expect to see this.
4,Great western spoof!,"This film,a follow-up of Support Your Local Sheriff,this comic spoof/parody on the western is very well made.Great cast including James Garner,Jack Elam,Harry Morgan and a guest appearance from Chuck Connors.Also well-written!First time I saw it,it was just okay,but the second time it was funnier.It really proves it's a spoof in the end.Can't wait to see Support Your Local Sheriff!"
5,My Favorite Garner movie of all time,"For a fun, family friendly movie, that you'll want to bring on a trip in your motor home this is one of them. Ranking my Favorite James Garner movies came down to the two Support your... movies for number 1 and 2. I had to good with the one that had the sidewinder, Susan Plesette and the X-Rifleman and Cub second baseman Swifty Morgan.SYLSheriff came in second because he was just passin thru on his way to australia anyway."
3,TRAILER WARNING,"Not quite as good as ""Support Your Local Sheriff."" The trailer, by the way, gives away the whole movie! I hate that!"
4,Recommended,"Almost as good as Support Your Local Sheriff. Excellent sequel. If you liked Support, you'll enjoy this just as much. highly recommended."
3,Leatherman Juice S2,It is the perfect size to be an edc tool. Quality seems lacking from other larger Leathermans I have owned. The knife blade came duller than a 2x4. I ran my finger along the edge and you could feel the burs. I do like it because it has just the items I wanted and not multitudes I would never use. It is also right sized to everyday carry.
5,Great all in one tool,"Bought this for my dad's birthday. It has everything you need for your daily tasks. I personally have have the Leatherman Super Tool 300 and I knew the high quality Leatherman has so I got this one. Plus it has a 25 year warranty. I bought the leather sheath that goes with the Juice S2 from Leatherman's website, its a few dollars cheaper than amazon."
5,Love It!!,"I love this leatherman! I lost my first one, after several years, and promptly bought the exact same one again. My only complaint is that I am having trouble closing it easily, but I think this may be because it is brand new. I am hoping that after I break it in it will line up correctly to close more easily. Currently I have to make sure I close one side down before the other or it won't close. I returned it when I got it because of that, and when I got a replacement it did the same thing. So I'm thinking it just needs some time. But I Love Love Love it! Use it every day!"
4,Good tool has replaced my Swiss Army Knife.,I've carried the same Swiss Army Knife for 30 years. The Juice has replaced it. The Leatherman isn't the perfect pocket tool but it's close.
5,The best of the best.,"I wanted a pocket multi-tool that was truly useful. The Juice S2 is that tool. Sure there are pocket multi-tools that include up to a hundred functions, cost a mint and weigh a ton, but what good can be said for carrying around a beast like that with some fuctions you may need only once a year, if ever. On the other hand a simple pocket knife may provide perhaps 50% of all the pocket functionality you need. The Juice S2 provides all the functionality of a pocket knife plus a small collection of truly useful tools which may provide as much as 95% of all the pocket functionality you need. The cost may even be less and the weight hardly any more than a quality pocketknife. Get the S2. You'll be happy with it forever.Review update: 4+ years later. I still carry my Juice everyday and have used it countless times. It is showing wear on the edges where it comes into contact with pocket change, keys etc. Still works perfectly. Best tool I have ever purchased!"
5,Great tool,"I've never been a fan of the big multi-tools because they weigh too much and thus I never have them with me. But I carry the Juice around every weekend. The pliers are solid, and squeezing them tightly won't cut your hand open. I use this thing all the time."
3,The tool required thorough oiling before use...,"The tool came dry and stiff. It required thorough oiling with WD-40 before it got functional. Otherwise, its quite handy, although I prefer its smaller brother (Squirt PS4) for daily use."
4,Not for delicate fingers,"I purchased the Leatherman Juice S2 for my wife to keep in her car. The pliers, blade and cork screw are easy to access and use, but you need another tool to extract the three standard screwdrivers and the phillips screw driver which is a little frustrating since they are most likely the tools she would need."
1,Poor QC,The one I bought from a local store had its flat screwdrivers mounted so tight that I needed another tool to pry them out.Pretty sorry for a $50 tool. Stick to full size LMs. At least you can adjust the pivots on some of them.
4,Designed to make OCD people twitch,"No doubt about it, this thing is well thought out and finely engineered. It is a beautiful little thing, and once you get it in your hands, you can't stop playing with it. HOWEVER, one part of the handle is uneven. When you close the tool, on one side the handles are flush with each other to a tight tolerance. But on the other side, this is designed to be slightly uneven. This really makes no functional difference to the tool. Some have even argued that this makes the tool lighter and better. But for some people, this will break their souls. It is even worse because some variants of the juice DO have even handles on both sides.But don't worry, this is something most people get used to. And functionally, it makes no difference and even makes the tool lighter. But I kinda wish someone told me beforehand..."
4,"Good, but not the best.","This is a great product for light duty work. However, it does have limited capabilities. I just prefer a SAK"
4,Great lightweight EDC multitool,"I have a Leatherman wave that i love. However i thought it was a bit to heavy for everyday carry. The size of the juice is excellent and so are the selection of the tools provided with the tool. I wish the tools locked into place like the wave does. I also wish they had more choices for cases. Overall, i recommend you buy this multitool preferably from AMAZON, they had the best price. A multi tool is very handy thing to carry."
1,Can't understand the good reviews.,"This is the most 'padded out' technical book I have ever seen. I can't see why anyone would be impressed by this. I notice that most of the positive reviews for this book are pretty brief and don't give any particular reason for buying the book only that they ""passed the exam"". Perhaps I am just a cynic... There are surely better ways of setting about passing this exam. The fact that the only good material in the book is pretty basic LAN stuff suggests that the authors are not of a sufficient level. I thought Sybex were good for the CCNA, but now they seem to be getting out of their depth. Let's hope they don't start writing CCIE study guides next. Or if they do, that people are not naive enough to buy them."
2,There is no 'real-world' experience in this book...none!,"This somes up every chapter in this book: Pages and pages full of unexplained cut and paste show commands. Tuns and tuns of show commands listed in line, no real-world troubleshooting experience given to add some meaning to the commands.The book reminds me of my college essays I used to do: Filled with padding to get to that mimumim required number of pages, and done at the last minute, without having done any 'real' research."
3,Not Sybex's best bot a good study guid,This is not the usual Sybex study guide quality but it's still a good book. I purchased it with the expetation of being a great book and it fell short. To me there was a lot of filler that didn't need to be there. I would have liked to have seen more meat and less potato's...I know potato's fill pages but the meat is what you need to pass the test.This book will help you prepare for the CIT exam but will not get you there.
1,Unacceptable absence of detail!,"This book just pastes in the output of Cisco commands without any adequate explainations. Obviously the authors know less about the material than many of the readers...Notice that all the ""positive"" reviews give no details as to what's good about this book. I guess Lammle and Co. are going to have to submit more ""reviews"" to compensate for this bit of realism..."
4,"A good book, but you need the course material to score high","A good resource book, I used this book with the course book to study and pass the CIT exam. You need the course material and experience to pass this exam."
4,Experience Life in the 17th Century,"The Violent Friendship of Esther Johnson, by Trudy J. Morgan-Cole is a fictionalized account of a true story. Esther Johnson was the lifelong and closest friend of Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels. Some historians believe that they may have been secretly married, but they never lived together. The book isn't action-packed, being an account of an ordinary life, but it is interesting reading. It offers a vivid glimpse into 17th Century life that is fascinating, and also an examination of an unusual and mysterious relationship. And it brings Jonathan Swift to life as a real person."
2,Interlude by Francis denney,It arrived in a timely manner and the contents were original but the spray apparatus was sticky in the beginning then broke down at about when the bottle was half full.
4,good,This product and shipping are awesome and I would strongly reccomend this product to friends. I bought this product for my dads girlfriend and she loves this scent. Thank You.
5,Always been a favorite,"This is a fragrance that has been around for awhile. I have worn this fragrance for 40 years and I still get complements that ""you smell so good!"" It is very hard to find in stores. This is a light fragrance, musky, not too sweet. I get headaches from a lot of fragrances -- not this one."
3,Under strength.,My wife thinks that this cologne is not of the same quality as the cologne that she has been buying for the last 25 years.
4,Awhole New Light by Sandra Brown,"I really enjoyed the book, however, I wish it would have stated that the book was re-issued from years ago. I read the book when it was written, and did not remember. You have to be very careful with Sandra Brown's books, and also Nora Roberts, they re-issue books from when they were not so famous. Thank you.Mary Loris"
2,Could have been better. 2.5stars,"Now, I usually have a BIG PROBLEM with love stories that involve a lover whose spouse died and they take up with a relative or best friend, however I can admit it, I did enjoy this book despite myself. Although, because of my convictions, I can only give it 2.5 stars. I think the same story with a similar premise and without the best friend thing would have been much better. I'd read it again though. But Mrs. Brown has penned better."
4,"Easy, thoughtless reading","The original story was released in 1989 as a paperback. It recently came out in a hardback edition. So really, I read an old story in a new format, right? Anyway, I typically do not read this style of book even though I do like Sandra Brown. This is one of those lover stories where couples of course end up happy. It is actually a good story and requires no thought whatsoever. Quick read with a light story. Sometimes I need a no-brainer book and this is one of those. Besides, the author lives nearby in Arlington, Texas. How can I pass up a book by a local author?"
3,Touching Love Story,"A simple love story that was well done and touching. I read it quickly and enjoyed it. I do, however, wonder where Sandra Brown gets her ideas for her character's names. They are always very odd and unrealistic. Other than the odd names she always has in her books, I thought this was a good, fast read."
4,Haven't read the book yet..,I just started reading the book and so far it is ok. i hope it is one of Sandra Brown's good books. She is one of my favorite authors so am hoping it is one of her good ones.
3,review,"the book was in good shape, I just hadn't remembered that I had read it before. But I gave it to my granddaughter to read"
5,Enjoyed,Love her action and sensitivity in her writing. I have not enjoyed her collections of other authors as in Murder for Love.
4,A Whole New Light,"In waiting for the next Jodi Picoult book to hit the shelves, I found Sandra Brown. This is the first of her books that I have read and I liked it. Easy read and gets right to the story."
1,Disappointed,"I have read two other books by Sandra Brown- Ricochet and Playing Dirty and liked them very much especially Ricochet. However, was totally disappointed with A Whole New Light. Rarely do I NOT finish a book but this was one. It went on and on about nothing inparticular- VERY boring. Left it on an airplane!"
5,I'm Going Crazy,"this songs has to be the hottest ballad of 2005...its a very simple song...no complicated beats and lyrics, easy to follow and to sing along...her voice is very soothing and it simply suits this song very well..i hope her cd doesnt get delayed cause i'm planning to buy it for sure...anyobody know her website or when her cd is coming out?"
1,I hate it!!!1,First of all I'm not under 13.ok.well I've heard going crazy and that song is sooooo anoying she doesn't know how to sing.She is not going to be big!!!!
1,WHAT IS THIS GUY TALKIN' BOUT,"Her voice is weak, the song is BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING, and the lyrics are predictible, people are starting to like it just because they overplayed it on the radio station!."
2,listen to any 1999 song,youll find the same variations and tunes of this songits boring because its not original and her song is only good for someone working in a barsorry
5,Love the remix!!,"The dj at the club I was at last night played the techno remix to Going Crazy. Wow! It was really hot!! I wasn't going to buy the cd single bacause the radio plays the hell out of this song, but since there is a cool remix I have to get it!!!"
4,A promising new artist.,I first heard this song on the Music Choice channel and I liked it immediately. Natalie has a great start and a promising music career. This song has a beautiful flow and Natalie's voice is beautiful as well.
4,this song rocks,"I like the way the melody flows in this song. It's smooth you know. Natalie's voice is cool too. There are a lot of skeptical people that are all like ""Ooh, is she trying to follow Paula Abdul's footsteps?"" I think she's totally different though."
1,This girl cant sing!,I heard this song on KIIS FM and it was annouying. She cannot sing even if her life depended on it. Who would produce a cd like this? Man it seems nowadays anybody can be a singer. This girl is gonna be a one hit wonder!
1,Less candlepower than a birthday candle!,Very disappointed in the brightness of these lights. Next to useless. I wouldn't waste my time or money on any more.
3,Sunergy White Cornerstone Light,"First off, this is a solar light. It is for ACCENT lighting.Unless you live in a complete blackout area, it will not lightyour way. What this light does do is cast a bluish-white lightthat accents whatever landscaping you may have and can be seen even without the light. I gave this three stars because 1 of 8 lights will only stay lit for about 1hour. All the rest have been staying lit for well over 5 hours and I've yet to have a sunny day since buying them 3 days ago.I'm pleased. ...Not bad....Good luck."
1,I tripped on mine,"There is such little light given off from these...I actually tripped on one. I placed several along the walkway leading to my front door. Only about half of them work at all anymore. The rest provide very dim lighting and only for a short period of time. I live in Phoenix and we get A LOT of sun light. So, I think the solar panels are just not quite what they should be."
3,good effort - but,"I'd followed the boy's stuff on pipebears and hoped that in it's published form that it'd have a little more polish. Did anyone edit this stuff? It's disjointed, and at some points incomprehensible.He does have super original ideas - for instance the whole ""hunt"" section - but they never really go anywhere. It reads like a pornographic flip book - that never really settles down and gets serious. It's a great first effort - and I'll look forward to seeing if the boy's style and storytelling skills improve in his next book."
3,"intersting, and beatiful",This video give me a education about the other culture. The diffrent culture from our culture. Give me the new information and knowledge about society in the other country
1,Pure garbage. Crappy Picture Quality.,"The only enhancement is that it is colored. Enhance the black and white, and leave it alone. The picture is barely visible. Don't buy this. There is no black and white option on this movie."
2,Please update the language and do a new printing,I have read this book and even owned a copy. At the least the old copy was clear but unfortunately written in the 20th century boring style. I can only suggest if you want something to go bed with this is it a good sleep inducement. If the authors or who own the rights could at least do an updated edition with language update I would gladly buy it and try to read it again. I'm sure the author wanted this information out to the public in a readable edition for today's world.
3,Thunderbirds are long,"As a massive fan of the TV series, and having missed this film version over the last 40 years I watched this tonight with considerable expectation. Sadly I was mostly disappointed.The film is too long with an over reliance on film of a Tiger Moth, which whilst its is cleverly done, with real footage and radio controlled models is not in keeping with the TV series. The long Skyship flight was over extended and the traditional main characters were largely under-used.That said some of the TV series strong points wrere still evident: Good music, occasional humerous moments and clever models with a particularly impressive explosion at one point.Its also interesting to note that when the film was made in 1968, the vision of 21st England was that Dover would have a very large missile base. Ah the joys of the cold war - halycon days!"
4,Supermarionation beats cartoons.,"This is an excellent entry of the Thunderbirds series. In my opinion Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation shows (Supercar, Fireball XL5, Captain Scarlet, etc) are far superior than cartoons. The sets and story lines (especially as the technique evolved through the years when the shows were in color) are so good, you often forget you're watching puppets. Hopefully other shows now on DVD in the UK (ex. Stingray, soon Joe 90) will be available in the US......FAB"
2,Their other movie is much better,"Like most of Gerry Anderson's puppet series, the Thunderbirds makes for great viewing for all ages; I like it and I'm 45! But Thunderbird 6 is clearly one of the lesser works; the short episodes are better, and the full-length Thunderbirds Are Go movie is far better than this. I've not yet seen Thunderbird 6 on DVD. The brand new VHS tape I saw was not a good transfer; it was grainy and poorly shot, the complete opposite of Thunderbirds Are Go! on DVD, which looks beautiful."
4,Thunderbirds rescues Skyship One,"Second Movie to be based on the FAB TV series. Not as popular as the first, Thunderbird 6 has it own charm and tongue incheek attitude. A must for the fan of Supermarionation and Special effects. END"
4,Thunderbirds Are Go!,"Gawd, I miss this show.I remember growing up. I have many fond memories of watching the Thunderbirds television program, but, surprisingly, most people my age never heard of it. They were too busy with SPEED RACER and MAGILLA GORILLA to take Supermarionation seriously, but I never missed an episode.THUNDERBIRD 6 is the video collection telling the story of Brain's ill-fated Skyship One; once again, the International Rescue team is the target of familiar puppetry terrorists, but they save the day ... but not without an ample supply of pyrotechnics applied to hundreds of miniature missiles, tanks, and fuel silos set for an incendiary climax. Supermarionation, cleverly mixed with live action photography, make T-6 the film to watch ... with some absolutely spectacularly aerial shows of the new Thunderbird 6 plane in action.One great flick that's as spectacularly entertaining as it is laughable (every watch a puppet shot through the heart fall from a balcony? you catch my drift)."
4,Who knew puppets were so talented?,"Oh, man, did I love the Thunderbirds when I was a kid. Who knew that marionettes could be so talented? And how I recall the days when technology could take care of everything--just add more rocket power! Thunderbirds was a great series, and Thunderbird 6 was the second of two feature films made by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson in the late 60's.If you're a Thunderbirds fan, you need this in your collection. (By the way, when you get a chance, buy the live-action Thunderbirds movie made a few years ago--it's a great family film that really captures the innocence, optimism, and attitude of the original TV series.)"
4,Good tool,"Leatherman has come along way since the first multi tool I bought. I bought the Juice C2 for part of a roadside kit, and I think it will work great. It's smaller size, compared to the originals, makes it less bulky, yet it has the essential tools included in it. My one criticism is that the tools are somewhat difficult to pull out, you better have longer, strong fingernails."
5,Outstanding!,"Super! Big enough to get most jobs done, but small enough to disappear on your belt or in your purse... AND, Made In the USA by Americans! Avoid cheap knock-offs. This is a QUALITY tool."
4,SO USEFUL,"I love this knife. I lost one and bought a replacement immediately. There's nothing I would change about it. Although I have heard other users (usually big brawny men) complain that it broke if they twisted too hard using the pliers, I haven't had that happen. Of course, I am neither big and brawny, nor a man.This is small enough to carry in my pocket without too much difficulty."
5,Good stuff,Got this for my brother as a groomsmen present. Sounds like he really likes it. Not nearly as expensive as some of the other multitools.
4,Great EDC tool,"Short and sweet, I love it. Easily carried in a pocket or left in the car. I probably use the pliers or the scissors the most out of all the tools, but I have used the drivers from time to time too. I'd be careful of the car opener, looks flimsy, don't know if I'd trust it."
2,A little under engineered,"Perhaps I am being overly critical, as one of the main reasons I bought this was due to the size. However; I must say that I am a little disapointed in this tool. The bottle opener is too thin to work well. You have to position the silly thing perfectly to get it to work and the cutter binds when cutting plastic straps. Not very impressive, I must admit. I do like the blade, but the cork screw is too thin and the straight screwdriver blades are painful to get to. I would not but this tool if I had to do it over again."
2,"Nice tool, great size, blade issue","I like this tool. It has the most common tools I require for EDC and it is the same size as most of my other EDC tools (Kershaw Scallion, Streamlight Microstream, etc). However, upon receiving the tool I found the knife (of limited use because of my EDC blade) had a heavy, pronounced burr on it which should never have made it past QC. Either this is a slip, or a poor QC process, but I am unimpressed. I have had other, mostly larger, Leathermans in the past and had a great experience. This leaves me feeling they are putting profit over quality at this time."
4,not the greatest tool for cork pulling,"The juice is a nice compact, pocket tool with most functions working fine considering the scaled down nature of this multi-tool. The cork screw function--the primary reason I got this model--requires pretty careful alignment of the lever arm with screw (once inserted into the cork you don't have much room to adjust) to achieve a direct lever-up action on the cork. I've done half a dozen bottles and must admit it hasn't trashed a cork yet. So definitely a good 'rescue' tool for road warriors but probably not your primary tool at home where you have other choices."
1,"Great Idea, Terrible Product","I purchased this case hoping to be able to keep debit/credit cards and DL without the need to carry a wallet. This appeared to be the perfect product. However, within a couple of weeks the part of the case that actually holds the phone started to seperate. It is not stitched at all but appeared to be poorly glued together. The wallet portion is very well made and the phone case portion is stitched to the wallet portion. I would not have this case even if it was free. Again I had to replace it in a couple of weeks due to extremely poor craftsmanship. Stay away from this product."
1,Too Dirty to Touch,Now I know to only buy new. The was a total waste of money. It went from the package to the trash.
5,Essential information,This book gave much basic information on the hands on issues of foster parenting. Very much the easiest read with the most essential information I have found to date.
4,ONE RED ROSE,"I don't recall the picture on the cover being part of the movie. Three college kids purchase an Irish ghost on-line. The spirit grants them wishes, but also protects them at the cost of others. The ghost, for some reason, likes to redecorate, and is not very good at it. The film is low budget. The gore sequences take place off camera to avoid the idiotic special effects that kill low budget productions. Instead they spent their money on a good script, some fair acting and direction. Better than an Asylum production. Makes for a fair rental.The movie has the same scare potential as the paranormal series, without the annoyance. The movie sets up for a sequel with some real potential.Some bad language, no sex, no nudity."
3,Don't open the box!,"In spite of top billing, actor Dean Cain appears only briefly in this horror film. I don't believe his work here even rises to that of a special guest star, more of a walk-on. The real stars are the 3 college students who buy a box online, purported to encase a ghost. The movie details the repercussions of their actions upon opening said box and releasing the ghost within. What follows is a bit weak. Few overt chills are produced (I counted only one genuinely creepy moment), the bulk of the frights are pure suggestion: did you hear that, did you see that, what was that!? Most of the victims simply throw themselves against walls as unseen forces supposedly attack them (none of this is effective). At best, this serves as how not to make a ghost story. (The idea proves more interesting than its execution.)I'm not sorry I watched it once, it held my interest for 91 minutes, but I have no plans to watch it ever again."
4,An Effective Account,"Spink has created a serious biography of Mother Teresa, which covers her life fairly comprehensively from birth to death. Mother Teresa's creation of the Missionaries of Charity, and her tireless efforts on behalf of the sick, and the poorest of the poor are well illumined by the book. Refraining from much criticism or praise, Spink also illustrates Mother Teresa's uncompromising stand against abortion, divorce and birth control. The style is a bit wandering and digressing (and as always I wish there were footnotes!), but nonetheless relays essential facts of Mother Teresa's life. The book is accessible, and recommended to anyone seriously trying to appreciate her life, in or outside an undergraduate context."
5,Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography,This book is a page turner.I am not Catholic and the terminology used to explain her beliefs slowed me down a little only because I really want to understand it clearly. I was surprised by her early life and origin. Her mission is quite focused and I appreciate that she would not train a certain group of people who did not base their work as a service to God. This is what kept her and her workers motivated.
2,A mediocre book about an exceptional human being,"There is no doubt about the caliber of Mother Theresa and when reading about her, one can only feel respect and admiration.Nevertheless - from my point of view- this book focuses too much on superficial details. I missed more insight into her motives and personality. Disappointing."
3,interesting,wanted to learn more about mother theresa and this book filled that need. It inspired me to read other biographies on her.
3,Basically a Breeders album...,"People complain all the time about the big gap between Last Splash and Title TK, but not many realize that The Amps is in essence a Breeders album. With drums from Breeders drummer Jim MacPherson and the wonderful Ms. Kim Deal, it's a must-have for any Breeders fan. Standout tracks include ""I Am Decided"", ""Dedicated"" and ""Tipp City."""
4,A shame they didn't release more records,"While I was familiar with Kim Deal's other bands The Pixies and The Breeders, I only found out about The Amps when I saw the ""Pacer"" video on VH1 Classic. This is a very good collection of songs, and I would've liked to hear more from this band. My one complaint is that perhaps this record is too lo-fi. I usually don't mind a lo-fi sound, but I think these songs (especially the title track) would've been better suited to a more polished sound. Standout tracks: Pacer, Tipp City, Dedicated."
5,Start over from scratch...,"Its like Kim Deal took all her previous experience and said ""F*ck it, I'm gonna make MY album, Breeders or no Breeders!"". It'll probably spend some time on the back of your shelf before it (because your mind can't get itself around it), but then, one day, you pop it in and it all clicks..."
5,god bless phil lynott,killer collection of vintage videos!!!!!!!!! worth it for any thin lizzy fan!!!authorized by thin lizzy!!
1,Save your money!,"If this is the same as the european dvd, it's a complete waste of money. Like the pathetic ""Dedication"" vhs the so-called ""live"" material is almost all lip-synced. Will only make you angry that Live and Dangerous isn't out on DVD."
5,Good quality and fit for 5-7 year olds,"I bought this for a 5 year old and a 7 year old, and it is perfect."
2,(Un)happy People/I Saved $14,"It was TP-2.com where R. Kelly eagerly tried to revive the ""12 Play"" days. The outcome: A cheap remake of his classic 93' release and his double-effort ""R."".4 years later Kelly again (in my opinion) goes too far by producing an entire album dedicated to various remake-versions of ""Step in the name of love"" off his chocolate factory release. Don't get me wrong, I like R. (and ""Step in the name of love"" is a bangin song), but this goes too far. If you want to listen to R. at his prime check out ""12 Play"", ""R.Kelly (his best)"" ""R."" and then maybe ""The Chocolate Factory"", but avoid this."
1,"Oh, come on...","Thanks alot for completely ignoring what I said earlier about how if you don't like it don't review it... I'll say it again. I love this double album and I'd kill to get my copy back that I lost yesterday!!!!!!!!!! If Mike's reading this, do you know if I left it at your house, Mike? Thanks.- Brian Morrison"
1,Praying or Preying?,"R. Kelly doesn't know if he wants to be a vulgar-mouthed street-thug, or a gospel singer, so he tastelessly does both (or tries to) on a double cd. Mixing God's name in with filth is sacrilege, but I guess it isn't any worse than preying on impressionable, naive, insecure 12-year olds."
4,Sweet!,"Although I havent heard the whole cd, the song ""happy People"" is definately another one for the steppers. If you liked Step in the name of love, you will really dig happy people. If this song is anything to go by, the entire cd will be... well another Kells creation: simply the bomb."
4,4 of 5,"R Kelly suddenly has a two-track mind and sex has little to do with either. No, it's all about love; romantic and religious love; as this double song set suggests. One album, Happy People; which comes right off the heels of his last club hit, Step In The Name Of Love; consists of night-time dance music for ""steppers"". The other, U Saved Me, is a collection of Christian gospel ballads; the kind of soulful testaments he's been sprinkling onto his albums for years.There isn't much in-between, musically nor conceptually, so the songs on each set generally sound alike. But that's not really a flaw because they're such good songs. Whatever you think of R Kelly, the sex freak, you can't deny the fact that he has a hell of a knack for composing benevolent songs like these, especially when he puts his angel wings on, does his best Stevie Wonder or Marvin Gaye impression, and lets the music fly up to the heavens.marcellee.com"
5,Easy Listening,I love listening to this CD in my car. It puts me in a mellow mood while I drive. No road rage for me while I listening to and singing songs about L-O-V-E.
3,r kelly happy people / u saved me review,"i give this album 3 stars overalli give happy people 5 stars thoughit is a smooth sounding cd made for you to dance to or just relax tou saved me is meant to inspire you, i only gave u saved me 1 star because the cd was too slow.There are 3 good songs, prayer changes, u saved me, and peace...everything else is too slow and boringhappy people is a mid tempo always refreshing cd which you can listen to from beginning to end because it is so goodbest song on happy people, love signalsbest song on u saved me, prayer changeshappy people / u saved me = 3 stars"
2,I use to be a R. Kelly fan,"If you want a CD with the same song played over and over again ( the first disc) go ahead and get this. I am just not feeling this new sound and image has fakely adopted. I am almost certain if he didn't have that dark cloud hanging over his head ( yes, the child porngraphy , remember) he'd still be singing those highly sexually explicit songs he normally sings. He's not fooling me.The supposely , gospel disc is ok, I don't know if its genuine but whatever.I give each disc a star, and I'm being nice."
2,WHAT HAPPENED,"I HAVE EVERY CD R KELLY HAS MADE AND EVER SINCE THIS TRIAL THEY HAVE BEEN NOT AS GOOD. TP2.COM WAS THE BEST CD I THINK AND NOW HIS CD'S AREN'T EVEN EXPLICIT THATS NOT R KELLY. THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS WAS A REALLY GOOD CD BUT IT JUST CAME OUT AT THE WRONG TIME. THIS CD THOUGH I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS, I THINK ITS A BUNCH OF GOSPEL,HAPPY, CRAP."
1,I just don't understand!!,I've been down with R Kelly since he was with Public Announcement and this is the first time I want my money back. I understand that he's trying to change his image but wow...let's not jump right into kids music. I mean I like gospel music and all but I don't want that from R Kelly...Mr. Bump and Grind has left the building!!
3,Half & Half,"I wasn't into ""U Saved Me"" at all because I'm agnostic, but I wouldn't knock it either. The man can sing and the beats were very cool, it just wasn't my cup of tea. I plan to sell that half of the cd. Now as for the other part--I'm all over stepping! My mother used to drag me on the floor and forced me to learn how to step and now I'm glad she did because this side was popping. R. Kelly is a performer but if he decided to become a deejay, he'd be GREAT because I love his intros about as much as I love his songs. I like it when he breaks it down at the end of some of the songs ""Uh uh uh...alright now...uh huh...now if you wanna step..."" you know the rest. He's just a phenomenal artist. I prefer the body knocking hip-hop feel he usually provides but I can see why he went this route. It shows how well-rounded he is too."
5,really good cd and a good buy,"first off i'm happy to have 2 cd's for the price of one. many artist don't do that. they try to make you buy 2 cd's on the same day, but that's another story.the spiritual cd is good and strong and heartfelt. and the happy people cd is good as well and is a feel good cd. r. kelly has all his bases covered on this cd...the introspective and the live and enjoy life are both present. a good effort and i think it reveals he is human and we all fall short..."
5,Double album,"I remember this album when I was in the 12th grade(just graduated). I love this album. This album took listeners on a joyful journey from the wildness of Saturday night stepping to content peacefulness of prayer on a Sunday morning. He is boldy going where most soul stars fear to tread. This album has been certified 3x Platinum. Remember,this was 2004-2005 This year of course"
3,Bitter or Sweet,"Am I disappointed or am I being a little to judgemental. R. Kelly is a man of extreme talents, but is it me, or does all of the songs on Happy People sound the same. Not to say that the music is not happy or catchy, but one song seems to have been cloned. U Saved Me on the other hand is quite an inspiration. 3-way Phone Call is amazing. At about 7 minutes in length, 3-way Phone Call is actually a 3-way Phone Call sang uniquely. U Saved Me is a nice song, but let's not be elementary with the lyrics. The same would have to go for Prayer Changes, which I happen to love. Should you get the cd. Well, if the cds were separate, I'd say buy U Saved Me and steal Happy People."
2,Not so sure...,"I have always been a fan of R. Kelly, but I have to wonder about this CD set. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are prepared to hear the same song about ten times on each disc. The Pied Piper really outdid himself this time - he must have set the record for the most variations on one beat on a single album. Each song on ""Happy People"" and ""U Saved Me"" sounds a lot like the title track, with only a couple of exceptions. If you are really in love with these two songs, then go for it, but stay away if you are looking for the variety found on ""Chocolate Factory."""
5,U SAVED ME,WELL YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE GOD FORGIVE AND I DO TO SOME PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN WHERE THEY HAVE CAME FROM ITS NOT GOOD TO JUDGE ANYONE GOD DOES GIVE A SECOND CHANCE AND ON ON ON WE ARE SO QUICK TO JUDGE WHEN GOD FORGIVE THAT'S ALL THAT MATTER .
4,Loving it!,"Great CD, beautiful tunes, men your ladies will love Disc 1, especially tracks 5,6,7 - wow! As for Disc 2, I love gospel music but an upbeat song would have made it five stars."
3,"""Happy People/U Saved Me"" Review","With a two-cd set, R. Kelly provides two sets of moods; one for two-stepping our behinds off and another CD for praise as how I like to call it. As every R.Kelly album he brings the soultry R&B/Soul to his fans needs with some hits of gospel. Aside from his past album ""Chocolate Factory"", this one brings so much warmth and realization that despite his faults, he is and still the best of rhythm and blues."
3,I expected a better follow up to Chocolate Factory,"This 2 CD set appears rushed and has a lot of useless tracks. Maybe his mind is on the pending trial but, it seems to me he put out a double CD to help offset his growing legal costs. This album could have easily been a single album and been much better and worth the 20 bucks I paid for the double CD."
5,Can't stop a stepper!,"R. Kelly has been on a non-stop roll whether by himself or collaborating with others, and he don't show no signs of slowing down. He's all over the place, now he's making a serious bid in Gospel.I was pulled in by the song ""You saved me"" which made me go and buy the CD. Every song on here could hold it's own as a single.This is just a baadddd CD. Where does this brother get these fresh ideas? Especially nice is the cut where he conciously or unconciously tips his hat to Marvin Gaye with ""The greatest show on earth"" (reminds me of ""Til Tomorrow"" by Marvin but R. still keeps it his own). Blue lights in the basement....!"
4,"Finally, some relief...","The bra extender has provided me with much relief. I wish I had made this purchase earlier (before 24 weeks gestation). The only thing is that the hooks don't line up exactly.(I didn't realize that even though my bra and the extender may have 2 hooks, the measurements in the distance between hooks is different). Therefore, there is a little bulge at both my right and left sides. It doesn't bother me too much because the little bulge is covered up by my shirt. Overall, a satisfactory product. Thank you.C.P."
4,great quick fix,"I recently broke my foot and was unable to exercise for several months. I gained a good bit of weight, and the band of my bras started to dig in and were very painful. I did not want to buy new bras because I intend to lose the weight over the next few months, so I purchased these bra extenders to give me a little more room around the ribcage. They work like a charm, no more feeling like my bra is cutting through my skin, and I didn't waste money on new bras."
2,Not great,These are ok. They are a bit wider than most of my bras but still can work. They are also hard and not very soft.
5,mamav,I am very ill and could not stand anything tight against my back and stomach. The extenders made it so much comfortable when I already am in so much pain.
3,As an implementation companion it failed!,"I bought this as a reference companion to a recent Exchange 2K implementation. Unfortunately, I ended up using it very lightly.The format of the chapters is mostly scenario concepts that dive into some details pertinent to each. The primary text being scenario based causes me to thumbs-down the general layout of the book.I was unsatisfied when looking to the index for topics that would give me practical understanding, and therefore some guidance on best practice for certain Exchange 2K topics. The book kept on about the ideas of possible implementation and specific case studies it includes.I may read through it again for some general less practical Exchange 2K knowledge, but I expected quality like that from the Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, but not so."
4,Finding ways to make the transition better.,"I have been working with Exchange Servers for about 2 years, and now I in the process of going to Exchange 2000. I thought this would be a fairly transparent transition. After reading through this book I was amazed at how much work goes into the migration and upgrade.From the planning of Exchange 2000 in an NT environment, to deploying and using Active directory services to over a 100 pages for upgrading and testing, which I found to most important reading.Also there is discussion of the clients, working with applications that integrate with Outlook and exchange as well as Terminal Server and Outlook Web Access. I have already used or will be using several ideas that I learned from this book.Finally there is a cd with tools and utilities included that help diagram the topology and another for modifying the Global Address list. Working with a couple of other people and using this book, the transition should be less complicated that I first thought"
3,Backup and Restore,"This is a great book, for consultants and how to plan, deploy and use in a test lab. The one thing that is missing is the Backup and Restore area, they give you a lot of mumbo jumbo on the requirements and RAID. What I want to know is if I have a server that drops dead, and I have a backup can I restore this to new server that I change the name. Now I am not talking about the Exchange Organization, because this is AD and must be the same. This was disapointing, not to have detailed information on something this important."
5,Learn about money with less germs,Ordered this along with addition and subtraction card sets. All were very nice. Pleased with this purchase. Good reinforcing learning about money in preschool or Kindergarden.
3,Sustain pedal,"I order this sustain pedal with my key board, but at this moment I am just begining to learn how to play basic music, I am not a the level of using the sustain pedal then I can not give a good coment"
3,no polarity switch,"I'm sure this pedal works fine with Yamaha keyboards, but not with my Casio. No polarity switch. Tried all the troubleshooting suggestions of switching the polarity, but none of them worked so I had to return. Make sure your keyboard is compatible prior to purchase."
2,Stopped working after five months,"I was happy with this pedal until it just stopped working one day, almost five months exactly from day I ordered it. It completely stopped sustaining notes, pressing on it had no effect. I checked over and over again to make sure it was plugged in and everything. I practice 30-45 minutes a day, I didn't use it every single day but pretty often. I'm disappointed, I thought it would last longer. Instead of ordering another one, I went with the M-Audio SP-2 which so far is working just fine. Hopefully I won't be on here again saying the same thing about that one."
2,Unhappy in Michigan,"I actually read and appreciated all of the reviews posted here before ordering this sustain pedal for my Yamaha keyboard and was convinced that it would be what I needed. When it arrived I was pleased with the weight and feel of the pedal.Unfortunately, like another reviewer's experience, my pedal worked exactly backward...the sustain is always ""on"" until the pedal is depressed.I could understand the possibility of this happening if I was trying to use this pedal on a keyboard built by a different manufacturer, but both the keyboard AND the pedal were the Yamaha brand.I've chalked up this experience to bad luck this time... and have ordered another Yamaha pedal from Amazon. I will return to post a review of the next outcome."
2,Default,"I've had to return this item twice now because it sustains notes when the pedal is not depressed and does not sustain when pedal is depressed. I have a casio keyboard and I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but I haven't been pleased with this purchase."
1,Doesn't Work,"Obviously the item shipped to me was wired incorrectly and they don't make them ALL like this- or else the other reviews would be bad. The pedal shipped to me has crossed wires. With no pedal pressed, the sustain is ON, with the pedal pressed, the sustain is OFF. Totally backwards. I am mostly annoyed because i got the super(slow)saver shipping and waited two weeks to get a crappy pedal that i have to ship back- and then wait another few weeks. Yay."
5,Great,What can I say. It's a foot pedal. It works just like it is supposed to. Delivery was quicker than I expected.
2,"A Great Sound, but No Control","After much research and testing, I decided to buy this Yamaha FC4 Sustain pedal to accompany my Casio PX-330 keyboard. I opened it up, plugged it in, hit middle C and the keyboard speakers filled with rich reverberation; only problem is that I wasn't stepping on the sustain pedal. Every time I pressed on the sustain pedal, it would act in reverse and cut the sustain. Likewise when I released the pedal, the sustain would resume through every note played, but with no control of how much sustain. I researched for different ways of solving this problem where I concluded it could be a wiring problem (possibly out of phase), or even an incompatibility issue with my keyboard. Needless to say, I decided to opt out and return it. I'm using the meager, but effective, Casio sustain pedal that comes with the PX-330. It's doing every thing I need it to, therefore I'll try a new sustain pedal when it bites the dust."
2,didn't work for me,"i was looking for a replacement pedal for my Yamaha DD-55 drum machine. according to the Yamaha Corp. website, either the Yamaha FC4 or FC5 pedals will function for the Hi-Hat/Pedal 2. but when i took it home and plugged it into the machine, it didn't work :( however, i'll give it 2 stars since the pedal works beautifully with my Yamaha keyboard--as good as the one i already have, which only cost me $9.99.so i'm returning the FC4 while i continue to search for what i need. i realize the DD-55 is has been discontinued for a while, but i was quite disappointed to find misinformation on the Yamaha website about their products."
2,Slips on tile floor,It slips on a tile floor. Bought similar pedal with switch that also slips but put non-skid material under it.
4,Yamaha sustain pedal,"They've been making these for over 30 years. The one I had was about that vintage when it became unusable. You could extend the playing life by opening it up and bending the thin metal strip which completes the circuit, but I was ready for a new one. Inexpensive and well made."
1,MISLEADING INFORMATION,"The product information states that it is for electronic keyboards that have a sustain jack. Well, mine does. Hence this pedal should work for me! Right?NO SO!! It does the reverse polarity thing that you will find in a lot of these reviews and all over the net. None of the fixes work. What a waste of time and money shipping this back and forth when compatibility information posted with the item listing would have avoided the issue. Very disappointing."
5,Great Pedal for Students,"For the price, this pedal is helping my daughter to learn piano with sustain. I didn't realize how important it was for her to have it. She was practicing her piano and kept telling me that she wishes she had a pedal so it would sound like a real piano. I didn't do anything for a long time until I found this pedal on Amazon.com, ordered it and now her piano playing sounds like the real thing. She is happy since she can practice at home like she does at lessons."
4,well made and working good,"this is well made one and works good - unlike some other cheaper one, whcih doesn't give real feel when you push the pedal."
4,Yamaha FC4 Sustainpedal edler Klavierlook,"This works as designed, my grandson loved it and began playing it as soon as it was plugged into the keyboard."
4,Athens,"I saw parts of this and other Bettany Hughes on Australia's public TV network, the ABC. I was surprised to find out that I cannot view the DVD because it is region specific. So what a waste of money. This has never been the case before with DVD's purchased from the US. I have assumed that if ""released"" the region specific thing was not an issue. This series is years old - why the embargo still?"
3,Great...but could have been better.,"I showed this to my world history class and it went very well with the lessons. However, the students all went to sleep and I had to spend the class waking them up. I couldn't blame them. If you buy this for yourself, you may learn some things; skip if for a class."
5,Fascinating view of Athenian democracy,"I show this documentary in my 9th grade world history class. Students find the comparisons between Athenian and American democracies very interesting. It is a long documentary to show in its entirety for a high school audience, but it is still a great resource. I use it to discuss the beginnings of Athenian democracy and how it expanded after the Persian Wars."
3,This one's a little different,This book is a little different so it's not that easy to review.I did like some of it maybe even a lot of it. There were some parts that were kind of slow. I loved the roaches part and the last part when they were searching for an intruder. I don't understand what the major point of the book was or if it really even had one. Here's the thing I wished that I hadn't actually bought the book because it's not a keeper. I would recommend that you borrow it from someone or the library just don't go out and buy it.
4,Hot Country by Lee Hodgson,"Hot Country by Lee HodgsonGiven the lack of material on this subject as compered to rock and blues, this book is a must. Each chapter is dedicated to a technique or style like the CAGED scale system or Chicken Picking and Pick Harmonics. The book contains an incredible amount of material most of which is demonstrated on the CD, although the book does follow the standard easy stuff at the front hard stuff at the back format, this is strictly not the case and it seems to jump from easy techniques to incredibly advanced techniques at the turn of a page which can be a bit off putting. But it's all here if you are prepared to work at it especially if your idea of a Hot Country Guitarist is Albert Lee or Bert Mason. Beginners may find the book a bit advanced and out of their depth but I'd advise getting it anyway."
2,Generally not very useful,This book is a perplexing mix of really simple concepts (i.e. the CAGED system and major pentatonic scales) and really difficult examples. Basically the only people that would benefit from it are people that are technically accomplished and can shred the heck out of guitar tab but that don't know basic theory or need an intro to country guitar styles.
3,"Good, but not for the feint of heart...","I agree this book contains a great depth of country styles and method. The CD is the poorest aspect of the package. He plays so fast that unless you are already reasonably accomplished, forget it. Also, the CD organization is extremely poor if you need to find and repeat tracks numerous times to get what he just blazed out. I spent a day or two with it and then put it up for a while until I catch up with it. If someone was standing there offering my money back - I'd take it. However, if you are an advanced guitarist looking to learn this style, this may be perfect for you."
4,Fun clock,"This clock is really cute. I bought it for a friend's baby shower gift, and was so excited to get it for her Hawaii themed baby room. It was a little smaller than I expected for some reason, but I probably ignored the published dimensions. I think it will be great in the baby's room though."
5,Kick A$$ Rock - Need I Say More?,"Well folks - the best CD I've purchased in some time. All that sound from a fairly unkown band too. It's driving rock with catchy hooks and melodies - what more do you need? First song to pull me in = ""Trouble Magnet."" Best song on the CD (as far as radio play goes) = ""In or Out."" Finally, my personal favorite = ""My Luck."" Tight performances, excellent production, and well-written songs. All this band needs is a glance from an A&R person."
3,Beware! This page is misleading.,"Beware! The pics on this page show 3 tools in various colors with no way to select the desired color which leads one to think you'll get all 3, but no it's just 1 tool at 3x the fair price."
4,Just darling!,"I love these slippers. They are so cute and perfect for just wearing around the house. They keep your feet warm, but they're not too hot.My only complaint is that some of the beads fell off one of the slippers after a month of two of owning them. Now, I did wear them almost every day, so they may have gotten a bit worn out. But I still love them, and you can't tell any beads fell off. Any girl who wants some slipper socks that are different, sassy, and fun, will definitely love these festive darlings."
5,Amazing Works of Electronic Minimalism,"Ryoji Ikeda has put the whole idea of minimalism into this recording through tones, blips, clicks, and other electronic noise. The sound is amazing, and if you turn your head while listening to it, the sound changes. I prefer to listen to it on headphones, because you hear the full spectrum of sounds assembled by this Japanese composer. This recording is a transcendent experience to listen to. You cannot help but to look differently at the world after hearing it."
2,not for me,i felt this book was written by a seventeen year old. the subject was ok. it has been done much better by others. could not finish.
4,Beautiful rack!,This pot rack is gorgeous. It holds all my pots without any problem- including all my triple ply stainless and 2 large Le Creuset Dutch ovens. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that the hooks it comes with for hanging it are 12in long- that put the rack too low if you are hanging a large skillet. We went and bought chain to hang it higher so my husband wouldn't have pots in his face.
5,Great!,Looks great hanging in my kitchen. Easy to install if you can find the studs.Exactly what I was looking for! Good quality that I belive will last.
3,A Cheap View of a Classic Recording,"This is a relatively inexpensive sampler of the classic EMI mono recording of the early 1950's. A good value, with some caveats. It sounds like it was taken from an LP, using a cheap turntable. This is what is happening now under European copyright law now that this recording is more than fifty years old. The first sound you hear is ""rumble"", so that it sounds like a tympany roll accompanies the horns in the overture. You do get used to it. For all of that, these are the choice excepts of this recording, at less than half the price of the EMI reissue. Karajan is absolutely on form, with Grummer and Schwartzkopf delightful as the title characters. Buy this recording unless you absolutely must have a modern stereo recording. There are other inexpensive excerpt issues. But you will never regret it if you buy the complete EMI reissue, mastered from the original tapes, and with a full libretto. My 15 year old did not believe that is was a mono recording."
4,The mini Tunable Djembe,"I really thought that it would be a little bigger. I bought it for my grandson, it's just a little too small. The sound on the Djembe was very nice."
4,Great Value,"I got this purse for my girlfriend. She loves it. She has told me that in comparison to the bags she has shopped for recently, that this was a great value. The purse appeared a little on the small side to me, but she is in love with it. This is a high-quality product, and well worth the money."
4,Discovering the Maltese Falcom,"If you are a fan of Hammett, Bogart and John Huston's film then this book is for you. I got this for my youngest son for Christmas and he loves it, he's a big fan of the book and film and Bogie. A complete fun filled background on the Falcon and Sam Spade. A winner..."
1,Not pressurized - not worth the money,Not pressurized so did not work very well -- not as advertised. Would suggest pressurized product to better preserve your power washer.
3,Not much to say - works fine,"It's not like there is any variety here, if you need Elkay clips for a thick counter, this is what you want. Not the greatest system, because when the screw is tightened, the clip really wants to twist in the wood and come loose, so you really need two hands to install. Unfortunately, when you are under the sink it's a bit tough to get both hands in there, but I managed."
3,"The Book is Wonderful, but It's Packaging isn't","The historical worth of this work goes without saying, but this edition has been poorly published as a pamphlet with only stapled binding. This work deserves more--at least an intelligent, scholarly introduction should accompany it."
4,flashbacks from my college days,It was a great book & counseling tool then & it still is. I loved it then & it still works today
4,Self-Help Book extraordinaire,"I'm O.K., You're O.K.I'm O.K., You're O.K. is an outstanding book for people with deep-seated mental problems. I'd recommend it for people such as S. Hauge who has an apparent Oedipus complex aka Scott-E-Dog. You really wonder about a person who adopts an alias with dog in it. Maybe he's trying to emulate Snoop-Dog. Poor, poor Scott-E-Dog. This self-help book could help if he could get someone to read it to him. You see Scott-E-Dog dropped out of school and has a difficult time reading without moving his lips and other body parts.Gunner July, 2007"
3,Not received,I tried to buy this book. You told me it was out of stockand out of print. You said you would refund. That's it.
3,worth pure .. and maybe one other,there are two songs on here worth you time .. the only bonus is you cant get them on Itunes .. Pure and simple over you ...
4,LAYERING CREATES A MORE LASTING SCENT,"Many like to ""layer"" their favorite fragrance, that is use a bath or shower gel followed by a body lotion then a spritz of perfume all in the fragrance of your choice. This is not only a pleasurable experience that makes you feel a bit pampered but it also tends to make your scent more lasting.This Body Lotion has the same delightful fragrance found in 'Still"" perfume. It's an intriguing blend of sweet florals (Freesia, Rose, Jasmine, Orange Blossom) spiced with White Pepper and Mandarin.One caveat: If your skin is extremely dry I'd suggest you opt for a richer moisturizing lotion, perhaps a cream."
5,Great Chemistry helper,"This book is very wonderful. If you plan on taking AP Chemistry in High School or if you are taking first year chemistry in Collge, then believe me get this book. This book is so wonderful, it's explanations are teriffic and all the calculations and meanings in the book are easy, with absolutely no nonsense. Along with this book, get Barron's AP Chemistry Review and The Princeton Review for Chemistry, you'll do great on the AP Chemistry Exam. Believe me, if you're taking college Chemistry or need an aide, then you should defintely get this book. Trust me."
1,Did not receive the product yet,It's been about 4 weeks and did not receive the product yet....will not buy from this vendor again..
4,Informative and detailed,"Fairly in-depth book. I learned well from this txt but it is pretty dense so don't expect to just pick it up and read it.It's a good quality but standard college text. Worth the money, I'd say."
2,"It was pulpy in it's story line, without real meat!",I suppose this was a good movie if you are a member of Opus Dei. I knew little of its founder however I still know little of the founder except that he was featured as a meek pious man . While the story was based in the Spanish Civil War- I felt that we needed far more substance and uniqueness such as was found in the Mission.
1,not what I thought,"This movie was highly recommended because it was about (allegedly) St. Josemaria Escriva. Well, it wasn't really about him, but his friend. It wasn't particularly inspiring either. The ending wasn't bad, in light of the rest of the film. I wouldn't watch it again, and wouldn't recommend it to others, but I guess it depends on what you're expecting from the movie too."
5,Great Movie,This was so well done. I would call it a combo of drama and action. Gives an accurate picture of JoseMaria Escriva as well.
2,Did not particularly care for this video.,I know it was supposed to be a part of the early life as a priest of the founder of Opus Dei so more about others that he was aquainted with. Would have liked to have more on what he went on to accomplish because of things and experiences in his life.
4,There Be Dragons,"A very interesting movie. It was a little slow in places, but overall, a delightful find. The history the film is based on was fairly accurate. I enjoyed that."
2,Very disappointed!,"(Spoiler Warning)This movie attempts to justify murder. The lead man, who the story is about, kills the woman he loves because it's what he thinks she wants. The fact that she does actually want to die does not justify his action. I was very disappointed in this movie, it was slow, sad, contained too much language for a family film, and the ending was not that great. It had a few tiny moments of goodness, which is why I am giving it 2 stars and not just 1. Would not recommend this movie to anyone."
5,great inspirational movie,This was a well made and historical movie. I am surprised this movie was so unheard of. Good message too.
4,Not what I expected... but still quite good and worth seeing.,"The trailer, in my opinion, was misleading. Still, it was a very good movie and I especially enjoyed the story line that concentrated on Jose' Marie Escriva. A true hero!"
3,Not bad...,"Worth watching, but not a lot to do with S. Josemaria. In fact, his story is kind of a side story."
5,"Great Movie, Great History","This is a movie that you have to watch, great message, very good performance of all actors, is great to remember the life of a Catholic Saint like San Josemaría Escriva!!!!"
5,Great intro to modern Spanish History,"Such an interesting perspective on the Spanish Civil War. I loved that there was a twist ending as well. I would give it 4 1/2 stars because I would have preferred it to be in Spanish with English subtitles, but I can see that the market is bigger with the way they did it."
2,Disjointed story line,"I expected something that would interest me, as the subject matter (The Spanish Civil War) does, but the movie doesn't flow well and is hard to follow. I couldn't watch the entire movie. I usually force myself to finish, but couldn't do so with this."
3,B rated Movie,"I don't know if it is just me, but I thought the movie was too boring and hard to keep track of. HOWEVER, my husband thought it was very good (ergo, the three stars) so somewhere I must have missed something. It did not keep my interest at all, yet my husband didn't take his eyes off the movie. Not Oscar material."
5,Divine,I could not find the DVD in a US format but I was able to view it online. Excellent movie and will buy the DVD once it becomes available in the US format. Highly recommend for everyone!
3,Pretty but tapers don't fit,"I bought this on impulse and wish I hadn't- I don't know if it is for tapers or votives - it is very delicate and lightweight and I fear the heat of a burning tealight or votive would would crack the glass- my tapers are too small without an adapter, maybe a small pillar would work? I certainly would not have bought this in a store, it doesn't even look to be worth the fourteen dollars I paid. The list price is totally unbelievable. The packaging was great, there was so much bubblewrap that it could never have arrived broken."
2,For Graham Rust fans only,"I bought this book on the basis of some of the glowing reviews here but was very disappointed. Yes, his paintings are beautiful, BUT his advice is mainly on how he makes HIS work. There is a chapter entitled 'Practical Aspects', but it has only ONE page of actual text! The rest are more pictures of the same work.If angels, clouds, and birds are not what you aspire to paint exclusively, then stay away from this book. If you are buying a book solely for inspiration, as I was, a better choice is a book featuring the work of many artists such as 'Trompe L'loeil' by Lynette Wrigley. If your aim though is to paint like Graham Rust, this book is it."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book to get ideas to paint my ceilings. Basically it was pretty much the same thing over and over again, with slight variations. Not at all what I was looking for!"
2,"i think it's a good idea, but....","i bought this used at a bookstore because i loved the idea of only cooking for myself and having shopping lists to go from each week, however, i have never cooked from this book because it simply turns me off. the menus don't seem varied enough, plus, i am the type of cook that likes to answer to my cravings and to recipies that make me feel passionate about cooking them. this book does not fit the bill."
3,Weird ingredients...,"It seems that everytime I find a recipe I want to try in this book it calls for some whacked-out ingredient. The recipes look promising enough but ALOT Alot alot of them call for ""Smoked Tofu"" something I have never seen and hadn't even heard of before buying this book. They are intended specifically to have this smoky flavour too. And what is vegetable suet? Where do you buy that? Do you really want to eat suet? I don't. Anyway, the book is a very good idea, but I just don't use it."
4,Single vegan doesn't want single portions!,"I find myself doubling the portions in this cookbook, not because they are too small, but because I've come to rely on eating my leftovers for lunch. I am a big fan of meals that keep well in the fridge or freezer - just because I often cook only for myself doesn't mean I'm not busy!!!I agree with a previous reviewer who did not like the ""meal-plan"" format...especially since dinner is pretty much the only meal discussed here. There is no table of contents, and the indexing isn't the best. From what I've tried so far, the recipes are yummy."
2,Bland food - gives veganism a bad name,"I bought this book twenty years ago when I was just getting started as a vegan. Unfortunately, I found most of the recipes that I tried very bland and boring, so I didn't get very far through it. I held on to it though and over the past year I've been rotating it with my other vegetarian cookbooks (I am no longer vegan, but still try to cut out animal products where I can). My opinion on it hasn't changed - the recipes are mostly bland and tasteless. There's no reason vegan food has to be this way!If you don't mind bland food you might like this book. The concept is good, and it's well-organised. But I would definitely not recommend it to anyone with a more creative palate - or to anyone thinking about going vegan because it will put you right off!"
2,Wish I could have looked through before buying,"I bought this book on amazon when I was first going vegan. I didn't realize at the time that the book was structured as a series of meal plans. You're supposed to buy all the listed ingredients at the start of the week, and make each meal from that as you go along. I found this a little too planned for my taste. What happens when you want to go out to dinner, or feel some other burst of spontaneity? It's very structured, and allows for only one dessert a week. I don't know about you, but I need cookies in my life. Try the New Farm book instead."
5,This one is my favorite.,"I really appreciate the author for creating this cookbook. I'm new at Vegan eating. I was pretty well done with meat, but recently visited an egg and milk farm. It was pretty sick. I wasn't real optomisitc about how to eliminate these--but still enjoy food. (I do enjoy eating, don't you?) So many vegetarian cookbooks I've seen have long ingredient lists, and things you've never heard of, so that after getting it cooked, I'm weary. These recipes are simple and delicious. I'm liking not just some of them, but the majority. Therefore I can go ahead and use her wonderful and conscise shopping list, and make it even that much simpler. She has it all spelled out like kindergarten.I love it, Thanks Leah."
2,Bland food but well organized,This book was disappointing in its plain foods and repetitive seasonings - the type of book that gives vegetarian food its boring connotations. I suspect some of this is that I am used to a wide variety of fruits and vegatables as well as more spices. It does give a good shopping menu and offers ways to use a dish more than once a week. I returned the book as there was nothing I didn't already have in a more interesting recipe at home.
3,product shows surface damage,the book case is very heavy. the surface of the product is peeling off in some areas. I will need to take a black marker and color the areas where the surface has come off.
2,Not a good value for an energy drink,"Many energy drinks are fortified with vitamins and herbal blends. OSO only provides Niacin(76% of the RDA) as a supplement. Other energy drinks such as Monster Lo-carb, Sugar-free Socko, sugar-free NOS, Rockstar zero-carb(in a purple can) and sugar-free Rockstar(in a white can) offer good taste as well as a near full complement of B vitamins and an herbal blend as well as taurine(an amino acid thought to help metabolism). OSO has an average taste in my opinion. The taste is reminiscent of a weak Monster lo-carb combined with a weak berry drink. I would recommend other energy drinks before this one. I will concede that the shipping speed on this product was excellent even with the super saver shipping."
1,Where's the beef?????,Pretty much no history of either the product or the company. Just lots of relatively meaningless pictures of board room type meeting poses. I gave the book away to a library - it was the only way I could justify the cost...
4,Walky Talky,"Like all of Henry Jaglom's films, this one is nearly all dialogue. What action exists is rather stilted. Some of the same character actors who've appeared in films from the 70s and 80s appear. This is an entertaining film about 30 something women who develop baby fever. Having been there, done that, I can testify to its acute accuracy."
1,I Couldn't Take It Anymore!,"Now, this may read strangely coming from a Jaglom fan, and a young father at that, but ""Babyfever"" was excrutiating to watch. I made it roughly midway and had to (1) stop, (2) rewind and (3)return. Sorry."
5,A must for all women between the ages fo 30 and 48,"I have watched this about ten times and every time I am overwhelmed at the emotions I feel. I laugh, but most of all I cry, sometimes happy tears, sometimes sad tears, but most of the time because I never saw my feelings expressed before the way they are in this film. Henry Jaglom and Victoria Foyt are true geniuses and this is such a moving and important film. I cannot give it enough praise except to say, buy it and see for yourself."
3,great seller.,this book was reccommend to me in the eighties and i finally got around to reading it. i would call it a period piece written by a adolescent.
5,Great,I really like my pans and rack. I use them alot! One of my pans arrived with sharp dent it in. I was quite bummed about that. Other than that I am very happy.
4,"Wow! Heavy duty, good quality.","I purchased this on the Friday sale for a real bargain price ($20) and that is quite deal.This is the real stuff - heavy duty, quality construction. I have used them with and without a silpat for baking cookies, finishing satueed fish fillets, oven roasting vegetables and many other purposes.They are easy to clean and substantial. There do not seem to be any hot spots or other problems.The only complaint I have, and I make it with reservations, is that they ARE heavy. Do not try to lift a loaded sheet out of the oven with one hand. The weight is also a good thing (see ""substantial"" above) but it easy to forget just how heavy it is going to be when you reach for that hot pad!"
5,Awesome Non-Stick Surface,"These are great cookie sheets! Solid, no popping in the oven. I made peanut butter cookies with chocolate chips and just shook the pan and they were sliding all over!! I didn't need a spatula to get them off, just picked them up!! The cooling rack is great too, very sturdy. I also bought the Exopat 11-5/8 X 16-3/8 and it fits these pans like they were made for each other. I tried to make Pillsbury biscuits on them and the bottom burned a bit even though I turned the oven down like the directions said. I think I just need to watch them more closely next time. I would definetely buy Chicago Metallic products again!!!"
2,Burned my cookies!! YUCK!!!!,"After reading the reviews I thought this set would be perfect for baking my daily supply of chocolate chip cookies for the kids. I have been using a Pampered Chef stone (which is heavy) along with a sheet of parchment paper. The cookies always came out perfect...but I was tired of dealing with the hot and heavy stoneware. Well, I was very impressed with the weight of the pans. It did not warp like my other cheapy ones. Unfortunately, my cookies turned out very, very brown on the bottom and around the edges....just the way we hate them to be!!! I even put 2 layers of parchment underneath and adjusted the cooking time!! Now I'm back to using the Pampered Chef stone. I haven't used the pans for anything else just yet but hopefully I will have a better experience with another recipe....other than cookies. Also, they were too big to fit inside my top oven properly but worked in my bottom oven. Be sure to measure before you buy."
5,Best food to happen to my dog.,"My Maltese was dianosed with ""sensitive stomach"" he could not keep any regular dog food down. I tried several brands recommended by my vet (which he could not tolerate) and then I found Hi Tor. He has been on it for 4 years and not one problem.I highly recommend it, but I also have found it hard to find."
4,good,"Audio is very good, but only Dolby 2.0 stereo, video is very good and the show is very good except for the crappy 1st 4 groups (not worth seeing anyway) that the band and orchestra obviously said, ""Your music is not very good anyway and we are not going to take the time to attempt to learn and play it"", so instead the band and orchestra sits silently while they ""sing"" to Karaoke music. My Yamaha receiver in Pro Logic Enhanced mode made the music have a center channel."
3,I guess it's okay...,"The lights were easy to put together and install. I allowed them to charge for two full days in the bright Florida sunshine before turning them on. The light they emit is a faint blue, hardly useful at all if you're really trying to illuminate something.Then, I discovered that someone else liked them more than me. A couple of months after I put them in the ground, someone walked off with five of them. Easy to install, you bet. Easy to uninstall, even more so ;-)"
1,DON'T BUT THIS. RIP OFF!!,"I can't believe Amazon allowed this rip off. All the good songs in the movie are NOT on the sound trk. Just the back ground music that isn't even good. When you receive the CD it says right on it that it doesn't include any well known artist songs. That was a waste of $13.00. Amazon should be ashamed! Whoever Wolf, the composer doesn't cut it."
1,Where's the Songs from the Movie?,"I bought this album expecting to hear Bruce Springsteen, The Who, and that song 'Ashes'; only when I put the disc in, it was all 'mood music' and none of the songs from the movie. I am taking this back for a refund - thoroughly disappointed."
1,Wasted Time,"I'm in complete agreement with the other reviewers opinions. I was hoping to find some different songs here. The movie opens with a great tune by Graham Nash, ""Simple Man"" and some other obvious classics as well as strong remakes. Unfortunately none of them are on this Soundtrack."
1,Let down,"Wow - I just watched the movie and came here to order the soundtrack.I almost clicked order, but then wanted to listen to some of the great music and so started going through the samples.I am glad I did! I had no reason to think that a SOUNDTRACK wouldn't contain the music of the movie. What a complete let down.I did find a list of all the music on soundtrackinfo."
1,Too Bad,"Upon walking out of this decently made film, I quickly raced to the store to pick-up what I assumed would be a soundtrack full of classic rock sounds and rock favorites, which were so eloquently put in the film as safe haven in which Adam Sandler's character, Charlie Fineman, lives in on what seems like almost a 24 hour basis. Unfortunately, there was NO Bruce Springstein, Jackson Browne, The Who or even Pearl Jam. Bands, whose songs drove the plot and characters in the movie. The powerful scenes in, which were sync with ""Love reign O'er Me"" by The Who, and sounds of the Boss's ""River"" album were non-existent. Why bother even putting the soundtrack on the shelves of your local store, not to mention purchasing it and putting it in your personal collection."
4,good music but not what you're looking for,"This is not the rock and roll classics you're expecting, it's instrumental background music that you never heard while watching the movie... It's nice, just not what you're expecting. You want to look for the ""bonus CD"" to find the rock classics."
1,bummed,I watched this movie the other night and couldn't wait to order the soundtrack. I wanted to hear the great MUSIC in the film - I don't even remember the Muzak on this stinkin soundtrack.
4,Elvis Has Entered The Building!,"Robert Crais' P.I. Elvis Cole is an excellent addition to the world of detective fiction. Crais shows that he is strongly influenced by Spenser creator Robert B. Parker, as evidenced by Cole's love of a good sandwich and a cold beer, as well as his snappy rapport. The Monkey's Raincoat is a great starting point I look forward to more Elvis Cole books."
5,"A hot new mystery writer, WOW!!",With the Monkey's Raincoat Robert Crais joins the greats of mystery writing. This well plotted book tells the story of drug-dealing and the kidnapping of a young child. Crais's main character is a cool LA (left coast) private eye named Elvis. Crais's characters have depth and are believable. The book (now books) are easy reads and I look forward to the next one from this excellent author.
4,Fun & Fast.,"Great combination of the loud, wise-cracking detective and strong, strange , silent side kick. A great beach read."
4,Fast Paced,"For anybody who loves Los Angeles the way it used to be before the '90s, and appreciate a good ole fashioned thriller, enjoy yourselves with this book."
2,I rate this C-,Quite boring. This book could be condensed by half and been a better read. Too much uninteresting and unnecessary verbiage.
3,wise cracking violence,"Elvis Cole starts his adventures in this book by taking a case involving a missing Hollywood producer and his missing son. Loads of violence and meaningless sex are througout the book, as well as over-the-top wisecracking commentary from Elvis. I was amused by the conversational tone, but couldn't wait for the violence to be over. I am not sure how this was an award winning start to the Cole series."
4,A good first novel...but greatness comes later...,"Crais and Elvis Cole, I imagine, will grow after this book. This was short read, but took me a long time to get through. The book didn't flow as well as Demolition Angel did. Cole however is really cool character as is Joe Pike. The odd pairing works. This book is a bit dated now, almost 17 years later. The story is not all that deep or surprising, but still fun. However, I think I will continue to visit with Elvis and his world and see how he has grown."
4,Crais introduces Elvis Cole,"Monkey's Raincoat is author Robert Crais first novel, published in 1987. It introduces private detective Elvis Cole and his partner Joe Pike. While the book has earned a number of awards, I thought it started slow and was a little hard to get into. It did, however, finish in a fury. Crais spends much of the first half of the book establishing Cole as a witty, clever and wise-cracking private detective.The case involves Ellen Lang, who comes to Cole seeking to find her husband, Mort, who has taken their nine-year-old son. Mort is connected to Kimberly Marsh, an aspiring actress and girlfriend. Mort's partner in a talent agency, Garrett Rice, has problems of his own. Mort also was having money problems.Of course, nothing is as simple as it looks. Cole and Pike soon find themselves in the middle of an organized crime feud. Along the way, Ellen, gains some self-esteem and determination, allowing her to play a key role in the outcome."
2,No Raymond Chandler,"Purchased this based on all the good reviews. Readers must enjoy books that have all the same basic features: stolen cocaine, police hostility, and graphic beatings. The author seems to think he is a modern day Raymond Chandler giving his protagonist clever sayings. However, they are not clever and so annoying and unnecessary that you feel he deserves it when he gets his mouth slapped."
2,Not worth the read,"Page turner??? Yeah, just to get it over with.I agree with Harmoni. First I thought it was too unbelievable that a detective would risk his life and go all out for a client without getting paid. Second, because of his too sarcastic (I guess he's supposed to be funny) antagonizing wit, puts law inforcement on the defensive. Pike who is supposed to be ""a fearful fellow"" gets shot just when Elvis needs him the most, so he does it alone against the mob and tough guys, duh! Yeah right! And last, having sex with the two women (especailly Ellen who is painted as an introverted motherly type) was ridiculous and not necessary to a plot that was drawn out.Shame on you Robt Crais."
2,"Decent dialogue, weak plot","This book was a bit of a disappointment to me, since I read it on the recommendation of numerous amazon.com reviewers who thought that Elvis Cole was a better character than Harlan Coben's sports agent/investigator Myron Bolitar. The dialogue is very good and quite humorous, but the plot is paper-thin and parts of the book (especially towards the end) had me laughing out loud in disbelief at their ridiculousness. The entire mystery was revealed about half-way through the book and I kept waiting for some sort of twist at the end, but there was none at all. I really wouldn't recommend this novel at all, as its good points are overshadowed by its weaknesses."
3,Interesting debut,"My first venture into the world of Elvis Cole in this, the first of the series.This is a private eye adventure set in Hollywood. Cole takes up the case of a missing husband and child not realising there is a lot more to this then it looks like at first glance. Don't want to give away any more spoilers!Cole is a sarcastic and witty (as per the requirement) but smart Private Eye. Joe Pike, his semi-sleeping partner is a borderline psychopath who is only brought in when the going gets very tough and dirty (reminded me a bit of Winn in the Harlan Coben Myron Bolitar books) but they make an interesting team. The dialogue is snappy and the action moves at a pace and the author has put some nice characterisation touches in there too.This is quite a short book and a welcome introduction into the world of Elvis Cole, I'll be looking out for some more in the series as I suspect the characters could easily grow on me."
5,on time & in excellent condition,Just as I titled this review--this item arrived when promised and is in good condition.I'm only on cassette #2 but the story is as good as I'd hoped.
3,Elvis Lives!,"I bought this because it came so highly recommended off of Amazon. It was ok, but not the best detective novel I have read. I would probably try more in the Elvis Cole/Joe Pike series, but I won't be in a rush to buy the books."
2,A pretentious comic book,This reads like a pretentious comic book laid out in prose. The characters are cardboard cutouts and the dialog is full of slang and innuendo. For the right audience but not my cup of tea.
4,Elvis is in the house.,"Typical Crais novel, well paced with spurts of action and a readable and satisfying story. Glad I finally discovered him, but I' running out of books."
3,Slow moving,"I was a little disappointed by this novel. It had been nominated for several mystery awards so maybe that got my hopes up too much. Reminded me of the Spencer ""he said, she said"" novels. While I wouldn't rule out borrowing a Crais novel from the library, I wouldn't purchase one again."
4,Not Bad!,"Since I've read all Mr Crais novels that didn't feature Elvis Cole and Joe Pike, I thought I'd go back to the beginning and see what I've been missing. I've missed really good stories involving these two. They're really good at what they do. Very entertaining."
4,Hard to put down,"Elvis Cole, the protagonist in the story, was a private investigator. He was tasked to find his client's husband and son. Originally dismissed by Cole as a simple case of husband taking off with his mistress, bringing the son along, he soon found that he was eating his words as murders, drugs and the mafia became entangled into the case.In addition to the explosive plot, what made the book enjoyable was the Elvis Cole character himself. He faced life, including dangerous situations with bravado and humour. Beneath the bravado and tough exterior, his sense of justice and loyalty to his clients made him extremely humane and appealing.I found the book to be thoroughly enjoyable and hard to put down. The fast-paced and tight plot kept me flipping the pages, eager to find out the ending."
3,Elvis Cole is Always Fun!,The early Elvis Cole books are so good for their playfulness and cheekiness. That they are great mysteries is an added bonus!
4,An entertaining page turner,This was a fun book to read. It was humorous and suspenseful; Elvis is an original and memorable character.I thought the end was too over the top with the violence. But overall it was enjoyable and I recommend it.
2,Not one that makes me want to read more,"This was a book club selection, and like most of the book club selections, I wasn't overly enamored with it. It was less of a mystery and more of a suspense novel. My biggest problem was, again, not liking the characters. The main character slept with every girl in the book and it just jarred with not only the characters, but the plot. It seemed that the author tried to cram too much into a single storyline, and came out with something jumbled, confused, and messy. It's also a little dated at this point, but that wasn't too bad. I did see shades of Miami Vice in the clothing, though... This book did not make me want to read further in the series, and I probably won't."
4,You have got to love Joe,"This is a short book, I polished off in about 24 hours. I think it is earlier in the series with Elvis and Joe. Just fun, I think this my last one until the next one, it is books like these that make me wish some authors would write more."
3,good summer read,"I enjoyed this book, but Robert Crais has written better. This book was Quite a bit slower than LA Requiem."
2,Not My Favorite,"Crais is very popular, and this is the first book of his that I've read. He seems to be trying to out ""smart ass"" DeMille's John Corey, or the late Robert Parker's Spenser. Unfortunately, in my opinion he doesn't quite get there. The plot and characters are OK, the book just didn't have that much appeal for me. I'll pass on his other books."
3,No Surprises Here,"Pretty much the same as his other Elvis Cole's. No surprises, pretty easy to figure out what's going on! Sorry."
4,The monkeys raincoat,"Another good cross book. Easy to read, hard to put down. Looking forward to reading the next book. Cannot wait"
3,first review,pretty slow moving and not at all believable.won`t waste my time or money on any other novels by this author
2,Where was Pike?,When I bought this book I really wanted to read about Pike so my question is where was he? The main plot -if you can find it among long-winded descriptions is fairly good but not enough from RC. So my lesson is not to read old books from RC.
1,Not a very good book,"I only read a few chapters of this book and therefore the review based only on that, but I decided that it was not worth reading any further. This is unusual for me, as I always try to read every book that I start through to the end. However, I didn't like the writing style, felt that it was somewhat juvenile and crass. I picked the book based on the number of five star reviews, so was quite disappointed when I saw the poor quality of the narrative."
2,I'LL TAKE ROBERT PARKER--THANKS,"NOT A GOOD IMITATION OF ROBERT PARKER---I HAVE ANOTHER ONE BY THIS AUTHOR---I'LL TRY IT AND SEE IF IT IS BETTER---PROBABLY NOT!!!LONG LIVE """"SPENSER"""""
1,Dishonest book dealer,"It's unfortunate that all Amazon book dealers do not conform to standard industry termonology. A PAPER BACK book is about 5"" x 8"". A MASS MARKET PAPER BACK book is about 4"" x 6-3/4"".No ethical dealer would send a Mass Market PAPERBACK when they advertized the novel as PAPERBACK. That is waht this lousy dealer did and they do not respond to my correspondence.Thus, their grade is an ""F.""This has happened several times to me in the past by various dealers.Alvin Holmes"
1,Not worth it,"This tuner came with part of an electric violin set I got, but after using it, I would not recommend this item to anyone. It is a complete waste of money. The batteries only last me a few tunings before dying, often at the most inopportune time, and I don't tend to carry 2 backup batteries as they're rather expensive. If the batteries would last more than a handful of tunings, this would be perfect, but you'd be better off investing your money into a quality item."
5,Great Stuff!,I received my product on time and it smells terrific!. My wife loves it! I would gladly purchase this item again!
1,You get what you pay for,"I've had this battery for a couple years now and I can safely say it's a piece of junk. It has never performed up to expectations.The only practical use for it is to fill the void in your camera while your original, high-quality Nikon battery recharges, because that's about how long the charge in this cheap battery will last."
4,Voice Of The Gods,"This is the 3rd book in the series and was well worth waitng for. Trudi Canavan has a great imagination, but an easy, readable style."
2,priestess of the white,"I did not like this series, felt like reading a religious novel. big disappointment after reading the black magician series."
4,A Very Decent Fantasy Book,"After reading the first two books in the trilogy, I couldn't put this one down. I thought everything was tied up very well in the end, and I just thoroughly enjoyed the book."
4,fantasy,Loved it. A fitting conclusion to the final book and a nice contrast to her other series. Interesting to see if she'll find a way to sequel it?
3,Interesting Read,This book was very interesting and keep my attention. I felt that I knew the characters in the book and I could see why the things that were happening to them happened. This book took a twist at the end and did not see it coming.
1,"Overly Contrived, Stereotypical","Characters are annoyingly stereotypical, without much depth or substance. Book is dated by its constant references to Rodney King and the typical white vs. black sides-taking of the issue. Characters don't seem to grow beyond their own prejudices, and all of the 'walking-on-eggshells' is tiring."
3,Modern Day Morality Play,"If this novel is any indication of Bebe Moore Campbell's talent, I think she's bound for an exciting and prolific career. Set in L.A. in the aftermath of the infamous Rodney King verdict, BROTHERS AND SISTERS introduces the reader to a banking world filled with interesting and complex characters both Black and White. Campbell has an excellent ability to traverse modern day racial complexities in a manner which is neither unrealistic nor condescending. Any Black female professional is bound to identify with the struggles and situations that Ester faces in the book: trust issues with White co-workers, dating a blue-collar man, walking the colorline, and maintaining personal dignity in a workspace where nobody looks like you. I found the novel to be enjoyable and insightful. It's perfect reading for a long plane ride."
2,zZzZzZzZz,"okay I started reading 'Brothers and sisters' thinking Im going to get into one of thoses fast paced novels and thinking it would be like Ms. Moores 'Your Blues Aint Like Mine' but I was disappointed. This book was unbelievably slow! and had waaaaay tooo many details about the bank where the characters worked/ ok, sure you give some detail about what the characters do and where they work but when you dedicate like 2 chapters towards it, it gets kind of boring. Anyways I tried to continue reading but didnt get half way until I closed it, I just couldnt take it anymore. Maybe it is a good book for the ones who gave it 5 stars but I just couldnt get into it. This is just my opinion. Take it how u want to. = )"
5,I love this!,"Came early, very good likeness, very good price. It looks and sounds just like him and is so awesome!!"
5,Simply Divine!,"This book is full of simple, heavenly, choco-holic pleasers. Finally, a recipe for Chocolate Decadence! The sauces in the beginning are wonderful."
3,Aleister Crowley,The book told me if I talked about it something bad will happen to me. Oh! No! I just talked about it!
1,THELEMA AND LOUISE or WHAT NOT TO DO ON YOUR HONEYMOON,"As dictated by the big bubble head Aiwass... uh huh, sure... More evidence of the Exploding Hindenburg that is contemporary Western Esotericism. Crowley wasn't so much a fraud as much as he was an adventurer, who used the occult as justification for his, to put it mildly, unconventional lifestyle. Would have been nice if he just kept to mountaineering and buggering North African young boys, but, alas, or perhaps ""Aiwass"", he decided he was the Master Therion announcing the Age of The Conquering Child. If so, the Child's a brat. Crowley was a wild eccentric, not the first or probably the last to spring from England's mountains green, but hardly a mystic. If Aiwass did ""exist"", one of John Keel's ""Ultraterrestrials"" maybe, the bubble head must have floated way chuckling thinking to himself...""Old P.T. was right..."""
5,Paper shattering the fetters of humanity.,"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. 93! What else can be said about this Book. It contains the single Law that can allow every man, woman, and child to achieve their True Will. The book of the ages, or at least the Third Aeon. I've been in awe of Crowley (his Magickal and spiritual works; his personal habits and predjudices are repellent) since my first reading of this book about a year and a half ago. FANTASTIC! Love is the Law, Love under Will."
3,This edition is ugly.,This is the worst print since at least the 70s. The hardback should make it nice but it doesn't. The ugly shape and doodly-lame gold embossings muss up the cover. The inside pages are way too glossy for my taste. The layout is not interesting.The high quality scans of the actual handwritten manuscript are nice though.This book is a 5/5 stars but this edition is not. I highly recommend you read he Book of the Law somewhere else. And older version or even online. Or in Magick.
1,Crowley's Curse,"The Thelemic paradigm is a literary tradition and bohemian will-based philosophies that Mr. Crowley merely popularized. Much of the will-centred philosophies & ideas leaking from Liber AL are by no means new or Crowley's own invention. Liber AL vel Legis contains no new religious or spiritual revelations to guide the human species out of it's ""dark night of the soul."" The formulas contained therein are of a Gnostic flavour, Crowley & the Thelemic cult is best digested by studying his works as if studying results from lab rats."
3,I'm still not sure what to make of it...,"Inspiration? Imagination? The rant of a disgusted young philosopher, or an initiation into a higher plane? Was Aiwass real, or was he just a construct of Crowley's tormented mind?We may never know, but I encourage anyone reading this to take the trip- if they dare. This book may seem confusing or pointless at first, but it will all make sense to you eventually... But, formost- Do what thou wilt."
2,PURPLE PROSE FROM A PSEUDO SUMERIAN DEMON,"Aiwass sounds rather like the bad poet Crowley was. Also, the ""Do what thou wilt"" was done better by Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel. Nothing really original here, but it never hurts to take strange drugs and drink wines that foam, and all of the other stuff Crowley did without having to become logos of the aeon. Crowley was a massive failure in three dimensions, so he cooked up some ""credentials"" for the credulous in the fourth dimension with the Book of the Law. Strange that this Sumerian demon just happens to speak English, with some Latin thrown in, and does it in the purple prose of the demon poet Crowley.Every man and woman is a star? Ever been to a shopping mall, Aleister?If you want the real deal in magick, get thee to Franz Bardon's Initiation into Hermetics, and P.E.I. Bonewitz's Real Magic."
2,No Match Yet,"The charger has a cross reference chart in order to dial in the Tester to match the battery you are trying to test...out of three batteries, I have not been able to match the battery model to the BatteryTender cross reference chart...I have few more batteries in vehicles I have not had problems with yet, so not sure if this Tester is worth keeping."
5,Good Toy,"I bought this for my five month old. He freaked out smiling all crazy when I pulled it out, It was big and colorful and that is all he really understood, but that made me laugh. It seems of a good build pretty durable, I wouldn't suggest testing the durability, your going to have your kid in it later. Unfortunately my rec center won't allow these in their pool. So we go to the public pool which is actually less crowded in my area and pretty cheap."
5,Fantastic Way For Baby to Enjoy the Pool,"My 8-month old loves this float. He kicks his legs, leans forward and paddles, and bounces in it. I feel safe that he isn't going to slip out of my hands too."
3,Thought Target was a &quot;discount&quot; store.,"Living in South Florida, I wanted to get my 7 month old a floaty with a shade. I found this one, and was all set to buy it, when I came across the EXACT same item at a grocery store chain for less than half what target expected me to pay for it. While I am hapy with the product, I don't know how happy I would be with it if I had paid more than double for it. Worth it, if you can find it elsewhere!"
3,Good for a small child. Not great for an older/bigger child,We got this for our 2 year old to use in the pool. The float worked well and he really enjoyed it but the shade tree was always flopping over on top of him. In the end we just deflated that part and used it without the shade.
2,Not worth it,"Flimsy piece of junk. Doesn't really work well and I would expect it not to last long either. Don't bother with this, there are better products out there."
1,Camo Hat,"Hat is uncomfortable, itchy. The mosquito netting obscures vision. Probably very good for hunting. Delivery was very slow despite the expensive charge effectively doubling the cost of the hat. I suggest you buy a net only and put it on a hat you like. No bugs get in though which is why I got it."
4,Boonie Hat With Camo Mosquito Netting,"Things get hotter under this hat.Visibility suffers some, But no mosquitos get in.rated on a scale of 1-10 8).Tested at 77 degrees would be better at 60 or below.Tends to fog your glasses if you wear them."
4,Wife of an F. Paul Wilson Fan...,"My husband's brother and sister got him hooked on F. Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack Series, so for his birthday I purchased several F. Paul Wison books that he hasn't read, two of them being the last two published of the Repairman Jack Series. There is one yet to be published, #15, and then the series will come to an end. My husband is a great fan of F. Paul Wilson and he was thrilled to receive these books that he's not yet read. I cannot give a true rating since I've not read them, but I'll chance it by giving a 4 star rating because I'm sure he'll enjoy these as he did the previous ones. In fact, as I am typing this, he's reading one of the books right now."
1,suprisingly predictable,"I have read all of Mr Wilson's books, and never before been disappointed. However, it was within the first 5-8 pages that I had completely anticipated and correctly surmised the direction of this book. I was quite angry with myself, and totally surprised that this had happened. A terrific author, with an unfortunate glitch in an otherwise spotless and remarkable body of work."
5,SG Tool aid 87675,This tool will make changing door hinge pins esp. on GM vehicles a snap compresses the tension spring for removal which allows you to remove and install the new pins then re-install the spring easily and safely.
5,Works great,"I've been taking this for around 2 weeks now and am so happy I ordered it. Overall, I'd say I'm very pleased with the melatonin.I take it about an hour before I want to go to sleep, and after an hour, I'm feeling very tired and fighting to keep my eyes open. I don't feel any side effects in the morning and wake up well rested.I have experienced a strange side effect immediately after taking it though. I feel nauseous for a few minutes, but that dissipates quickly."
5,Great for shift work,"I work nights and sleep during the days. The days when I get home and am still energized from work, theses are very effective at helping me doze off. Good taste, dissolves fast, and works fast!Generally they start working in 20 minutes, compared to the pills which take atleast an hour.I take 2 tablets, but I work start at half and work from there."
2,Didnt work,I have hard time falling asleep and any of the over the counter meds works. So after taking this i felt nothing at all but i might work for others who knows. I give it 2 stars because it doesnt make you crazy tired the next day like some other meds
2,Didn't work for me,I bought this product on because of a recommendation on the Dr. Oz program. I found that it did not help me to sleep at all.
5,Finally - an entire nights sleep!,I'm one of those who woke up predictably at 2 am and couldn't fall back asleep. This has allowed me to sleep all night long without interupption. Wake up refreshed and ready to go - I LOVE this product. The mint flavor is a bonus!
5,This stuff works,I've been using Source Naturals Melatonin for some time now and it works great. I usually can get by with just 1mg and it helps me throughout the night to get a good night's sleep. My cat will often bug me at 4:30 am and sometimes I have trouble getting back to sleep if I haven't taken my melatonin before bed. It just seems to make it possible for me to be disturbed and then get right back to sleep. I love the stuff!
2,4hrs sleep max,1st of all local grocery stores sell this product for half of the price here2nd the product works but only garantee 4 hours sleep and i wake up every single day after getting 4 hours' sleep till 10am when i got to get up and go to school.over all i think this is kinda miserablewont buy this again
1,not tired,"sometimes i don't understand the good reviews some products get, i just took one of these pills, put it under my tongue over an hour ago, it is 3 am now and i am more awake than when i took it, more money i wasted, needed tea spoons so i bought a whole flatware set, tea spoons not a regular size teaspoon, rag you wet and shake to keep you cool, just a wet rag, hair clippers, blade dull doesn't even cut after one day, not really blaming amazon, but out of 100 things i bought over last 3 years, i have thrown away half, that were total garbage."
5,Fast-acting Natural Sleep Inducer,"I bought this to help me fall asleep after suffering from insomnia post major surgery. I had been using OTC products such as Benadryl and Unisom, both of which left me with huge next-day hangovers, not to mention side-effects. While it turns out that my insomnia was caused by hormonal changes, the little sleep I have managed is thanks to the melatonin. I can fall asleep within 30 minutes., suffer NO side effects, and best of all experience NO NEXT DAY HANGOVER. And for me, one 2.5mg tablet works perfectly. (If only getting my hormones adjusted/balanced were just as easy)."
4,nice west coast house,more upbeat than the naked productions... too many bells/whistles/swooshes on the first disc - the inclusion of Migule Migs' track makes up for it. latino beats on the second disc are a warm welcome.
5,A Great Read,"Warriors is a war novel par excellence. The characters were believable, the military tech was cool, and the story was believable."
1,Poorly Written Novel,I was unconvinced that American pilots could transform the Saudi Air Force into an air force that could challenge Israel's experienced pilots. The Saudis have made a very weak showing in every war that their air force has been involved in.
1,BIG MISTAKE!,"This thing attracts so many Japanese beetles its crazy! Yea, it kills some but you will have 10 times as many in your garden than you had before!!!"
5,Jerome would be........!,"The New Jerome Biblical Commentary is a very dense, yet useful commentary which provides a good treatment of Scripture.Worth the investment and time for using it fruitfully in study."
1,Not the 3rd Edition,"The copyright date inside the book is for 1990, not 1999 (according to the publisher, it should be 2000). Even though the ISBN matches what should be the 3rd edition, the pages inside say differently. I tried to contact the site to get some clarification on this matter but that's impossible. All I could do was request a recall tag for the wrong book. Very disappointing!"
4,As expected,"The New Jerome Biblical Commentary is as you would expect the text to be-can be wordy at times, and the text is quite small so avoid if you have poor eysight."
1,Warning EWTN condemns this commentary,"EWTN (Catholic Channel) condemns this publication.Here's a quote from their site:""I want to illustrate the current state of affairs by reference to the<New Jerome Biblical Commentary>, published in 1989. This 1,500-pagework so undermines the teaching of Scripture that a logical personwho accepted its conclusions would consider himself bound to rejectthe Catholic Church as a reliable guide to the Bible.""You can find the entire article at ewtn dot com /library/scriptur/destbib.txt"
2,Un-Scholarly,"This commentary is exceptional in the amount of material it covers. Referencing this commentary on two different occasions for serious scholarship on a few tough questions has turned out not provide any adequate answers. One New Testament question and one Old Testament question was not answered properly in this text. In fact, it made light of it. The New Testament example was Jesus who rode on both donkeys implying he rode both animals. Instead of clarifying the language in the Bible as not misleading it continues on with the trickery. The reviewer who gave the commentary a 1 star review had some important things to say about this text. I'm a Catholic. The dissenting view has value and is a reasonable reflection. If you want to take a look go ahead and get it. But I didn't have to go too far with it to find it unreliable on some basic questions. The other Old testament question was in Genesis. You should have materials to cross reference before you include this in your library."
1,Jerome,"I have read many Biblical commentaries. I was looking for a Catholic Bible commentary, because I am Catholic but this Jerome commentary is the least organized and the most controversial; almost evasive in its format and content."
5,A Wealth Of Knowledge,"One thing you get from this commentary is a wealth of knowledge not only from the bible but about the church fathers, Critical views of today and the past. Its a great reference commentary to understanding the bible more clearly. Im very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to all who seek to understand the bible more clearly."
2,"Too catholic for most, low theology of The Word","This commentary on the Bible will not please those who truly love the scriptures. For one thing, it is so catholic in its interpretation that one can almost smell the incense. It also does acrobatics with the verses having to do with justification by faith, twisting and contorting them to mean what they clearly do NOT mean in order to fit in with catholic theology. Relies a great deal on modern critical methods with little discernment. The result is that very little is taken concretely and non-allegorically. This commentary has a very low theology of the scriptures. The end result is that the JBC seems to see the Word of God as something incidental to the Church, a mere accessory, rather than the church being the result of the proclamation of the Word. Sad and misguided."
2,You get what you pay for,"3 out of 4 of these things work (4th wouldn't retract). They feel cheesy, but they're inexpensive."
4,At your hip,"This is a very nice contraption, no longer will you experience lost keys or badges just attach to your belt hoop and go!"
3,seems okay,Durability of the plastic parts are not great. i have already broken one of the tabs that holds the internal spring.
1,Broke within 7 months!,"I purchased this keyboard replacement from the Brilliant Store in June of 2009. I hardly use it as my laptop is connected to a stand alone keyboard. I had the original laptop keyboard for over 5 years before I ever had a problem with it. In all fairness to the Brilliant Store, they said they would replace it but it means finding another shop to remove the new useless keyboard (and paying again for that service), sending it back to Brilliant Store and then waiting for the new keyboard to comeback. Question is, if a product they sent only lasted 7 months, do I really want to take a chance on another keyboard from that store? Not really faulting the seller (or am I?) Perhaps when buying replacement parts it pays to shell out more $$ to purchase from the manufacturer. I guess bottom line is ""you get what you pay for""."
4,Buenisimo,Trabaja perfecto hasta el momento no da problemas buen teclado y se los recomiendo q lo compren es demasiado bueno y cambiarlo es super facil
4,Good Book,"I believe this book covers the basics well, however it does not get into how to generate the leads in the first place (i.e., the list of phone numbers and contacts to call)."
5,Cold Calling Dentistry,"This is the best book ever on the subject of telemarketing and prospecting...often (and sadly) referred to as COLD CALLING. Written with a sense of humor and a healthy balance in the reality checkbook, it steers clear of the canned script ideas perpetuated by so many of the ""sales-gurus"" and focuses on achievable goals (just making the call is seen as a success) and realistic, friendly dialogue with the person on the other end. What I enjoyed most is Ms Greene's ""angle"" that the caller not be so-damn-clever and put him/herself in the listener's place and make the process enjoyable and informative as opposed to adversarial. Read the book, visit the website, subscribe to the free e-sales-tips and take advantage of the author's offer for a hour of free coaching. What a bargain! A fun, fresh and human approach to a necessary element of building a contact base."
5,Review,"Great experience, contacted me immediately and shipped item the following day. He also sent tracking information and contacted me once again to ensure everything was accurate. Great customer service, I would highly recommend his services."
3,Wake Up Corporate America,"OK. Here's a news bulletin. Women and men think differently, including business stuff. So this book was more helpful to me than other books I've read on the same topic written by men. Why? Because this one's actually funny, and she tells the truth why she's calling (a lot of men try to ""sneak"" their way into an appointment....and if you're too dumb to know when someone's trying to sell you something, then you shouldn't talk to anyone calling you).To any women (no, I'm not a feminatzi)who have to do some cold calling for their job, this is good starter. And I don't believe most of that crap about people who ""love"" to cold call. Balony. It's not fun, even if it can mean more money."
2,This book needs some serious editing,"Reading this book was very frustrating. I couldn't figure out what the author was trying to teach the reader. The first 50 pages are a waste of time and when you finally reach an area where the author seems to be teaching you don't even realize it.I don't even thnk the book really has any {chapters} it just rambles and rambles with polyanna style jokes that aren't funny, just annoying.As far as what the message in the book teaches is ... are you ready:When you make a sales call, make it conversational like you are speaking to a friend. There, I just about summed up the book. The other ""stuff"" is dis-jointed writing that will make your thoughts drift as you read.Certain section of the book are written on only one side of a page and the other side is taking space with a ""witty"" tiny proverb.I don't know if this is to give the book an appearance of having more content, but I found it very annoying.Bottom line, don't waste your money and more importantly YOUR TIME."
3,Editing Department?,"I have started a new position and this book is required reading. I am 27 pages in and feel that I have to say something about this book now. So far the content is OK and making me feel more comfortable about doing extensive cold calling. I have to say that this is the poorest editing job of any book that I have ever come across, and I am not one of those people that look for mistakes. These just beat you over the head though. There has to have been over a dozen mistakes so far, and repeating 4 paragraphs on page 27 was enough to send me over the edge. I am looking forward to finishing this book, I just hope the editing gets better soon."
5,What an amazing book!,"I've looked at several book on telemarketing. This book is by the far the most pratical and enjoyable I've read- simply outstanding for those that are new to telemarketing, or that have undertaken it without enough success or confidence. It provides you with very practical, specific and easily-applied advice across the entire range of possible interactions. Moreover, it provides two or three frameworks to use in approaching potential clients and for managing your processes to success.Toss out all the other books- this is the one you need for organizing your efforts, gaining all the right tools and managing yourself for success."
4,Great chick lit.,"'The Makeup Girl' is about Faith Wishart who want's more than what life has put her way. Ever since her father died things haven't been the same. Her sister Hope ran away to Australia and her brother Mark is anything but close to her. Her mother hasn't been the same either... too sad to deal with anything.So one day her mom has broken down and crying, Faith tells her mother she has finally met a man named Adam who's a big shot lawyer. Mom stops crying in an instant and Faith decides she must keep true to her lies or her mother wont stay happy. Then when sister Hope comes back into town with an engagement of her own faith realizes she has to make her 'made up' life become a reality.Any fan of chick lit will truly enjoy this funny heartwarming book."
5,Backyard Skateboarding 2006,"I purchased Backyard Skateboarding for my 8 year old grandson. Apparently, he is very satisfied with it. The delivery was super fast. Kudos to Humongous."
4,Danielle Steele Writes Suspense,"Highly readably. I did guess whodunnit early on, but I kept on turning those pages."
5,oy,"yo erase any confusion this is a superb single from the early nineties uk dacne act LFO Low Frequency Osciallations, not LFO, the nasty pop group,"
2,disappointed,"Pros:1.Lightweight construction.2.Smooth rolling.Cons:1.Lack of cushion: as other comments pointed out, baby actually sits on folded bars without any cusioning at all;2.Tendency to tilt in the jogging mode: its design renders the larger frong wheel to tilt the trailer upward and back, causing safety hazard.3.Too wide to pass through doorways.4.Product arrived with missing components.5.Handle comes as a separate part not integrated to the trailer; it needs to be carried separately and has to be installed/removed every time you fold the trailer for storing in car trunk.6.Mediocre safety belt design: difficult and uncomfortable to use; they do not have the convenience, comfort and safety provided by the types commonly found in regular strollers and car seats.Overall:Schwinn/In step intends to market Mark III as a higher-end product their product lines. However, it's quality and design do not justify its price and do not meet expectations. Would not recommend."
4,Great fun for the Family,"This is a great thing to have if you have small children that are too young to ride with you on their own bikes. The only problem we have is that we have to add a pillow behind our son and daughters back (aged 1 and 5) so their helmets don't hit the back of the seat. The seat back goes straight up, so when they have their helmets on they have to always look down slightly to keep it room falling over their faces. But we put in the pillow and it gives them just enough room to be comfy, if a little bit cramped."
1,Company wont fix it,First your child has to be like 18-24 months before the really fit in this trailer. I put my daughter in when she was 13 months old and she kept sliding way down and I would have to stop the bike and set her back up because she would cry because she was so uncomfortable. Other then that this trailer works good for a bike trailer. It is hard to put together each time you use it. I purchased this to also use it as a jogger. I do not recommend it for a jogger. It is hard to turn because the front wheel does not swivel. I have had this for about 9 months and have only been able to get the front wheel on twice. Both times it took 30 min. and i pinched my fingers. I called the company (instep) and they said they wouldn't do anything about it. They told me to take it to a bike shop. I say stay away from this trailer and get a different one. I have only had frustration with this product.
4,Schwinn,"Not much padding for kids and jogging arm is a little to close to the cart, other than that for the price I'm happy with the stroller."
2,Returned it.,"It just was too bulky and cumbersome to really be worth the money. We park our bikes inside and this doesn't fit through a normal door so we had to take it off the bike each time and turn it on it's side to fit it through the door frame. Also, the security straps are useless and totally flimsy. Our daughter, who is 17 months, on a 1-hr bike ride was basically lying on her side from the slouchy seat and lack of firm harness to support her upright. The ""jogger handle"" is kind of weird and just clamps onto the outside of the fabric around the back bars but I guess it would work if we found the whole in-and-out-of-the-house effort to be worthwhile. Lastly, don't plan on taking it anywhere with you! It's a HUGE hassle to fold down and VERY heavy. Not what we were hoping for and not worth paying over two hundred dollars for. -but it does work fine as a trailer and our daughter was pretty happy in it if none of the other things bother you."
5,Gerber LMF II 1400,Very happy with the LMF II. before getting it I was having mixed feelings. Some of others users thought it as some kind of ax........
3,"Beast of a knife, didn't care for the sheath","I really love the size, heft and feel of the Prodigy knife and was hoping that bigger would be better witht he LMF II. I was surprised and disappointed at what a beast this knife felt like after my familiarity with the prodigy. My disappointment is really more with the setup that came with the knife. The sheath and all the leg straps it came with left me feeling like I needed to go out on field exercises or be dropped from a plane to justify carrying the thing. It is impressive to heft and hold but unless I find a more slimmed down sheath, I don't see myself ever using it on a campout or a hike. It will take Armageddon to get the full use out of this knife. I would recommend going with the Prodigy unless you are a real soldier or you want something hard core for survival uses."
4,Solid knife,"Pros: Solid build, excellent shealth, color options, moolle options.Cons: plastic on handle will break eventually, grips feels good but can't last for very long and heavy"
5,Solid knife,"Bought this on the basis for camping, and ""I am not disappoint"". This knife is very well built, couldn't be happier with my purchase."
2,Misrepresented,"Item advertised as ""Like New"" . Not even close. No straps or belt cutter, lots of use and with many obvious signs of age and use. One good note: shipped very fast. Should have spent the extra 8 bucks and got a new one."
5,Gerber LMF,I bought this for my Afghanistan deployment. Truly well built with optimal usage in mind along with being modular in placing on the IBA or IOTV.
2,Not to happy,Blade becomes unsharp cause of the sheath when u pull it out it rubes aginst the metal in the sheath
2,Don't let the title fool you!,"Made in UK in 2000, Serial# MYSCD-144, Playing Time 73:44Even though this disc is labeled a ""best of 1969-1999"", there's a number of things that need to be said about it.First, the bulk of the disc (9 tracks out of 10) are originally on their first 5 albums (up to ""Wolf City""), spanning the 1969 to 1972 era; the only recent track is track 10, ""Nada Moonshine #"", from the album of the same name.Second, most tracks segue into one another, while the originals didn't. ""Why?"" you ask! Simple: material on this disk has been remixed!IMHO, the material should have been left alone. A best of? Hardly!"
2,Amon Duul - 'Once Upon A Time' (Mystic) 2 1/2 stars,"Looks to be a ten track compilation of Amon Duul II remixes.Not every AD II fan will even want this. I mean, for a the first few spins, it seems that cuts like ""Phallus Dei"", the thirteen-minute ""Soap Shop Rock"" and ""Wolf City"" are decent. But overall, this mediocre release is STRICTLY for the die-hards. This was the first time I've gotten to hear a tune off their reunion CD, it's title track ""Nada Moonshine"". It's okay."
2,Yet another attempt to milk the ADII legacy dry,"Recently both Captain Trip and Mystic Records with the help of Gerhard Augustin have been releasing rather mediocre remixes of Amon Duul II material as unearthed lost recordings (""Kobe"" and ""Eternal Flashback"" for example), thus ripping off unsuspecting Amon Duul II fans. ""Once Upon A Time"" at least is honest in the fact that it is no more than a compilation of older recordings, or is it? Most of the songs have been given a hasty remix and production job, so it hardily represents Amon Duul II in their full glory. Also to include the live version of ""Archangel Thunderbird"" was a poor choice since it is the studio version for this band is best remembered. This is a compilation that no one, except it's remixer and producer would find entertaining. Those who know Amon Duul II would likely go for the original versions while this compilation would more than likely turn the uninitiated off to this great band."
1,Somebody please do this band justice!!!,Yet another Amon Duul 2 rip-off. I do not understand why all the CD re-releases of a band as wonderful as AD2 stink. This one is absolutly the worst (with the remix Carnival in Babylon a close second) but the sound on every AD2 Cd re-issue is bad. I'm glad that I kept my vinyl versions. All my AD2 CDs have a homemade disk burned from the vinyl along with the legit reissue disk. I only keep the remix CDs for the bonus tracks.
5,Wonderful Discernment Resource,This book is a wonderful resource and tool for anyone who is discerning a sense of call to ministry and a GREAT help in discerning whether one is being called as an ordained or lay minister. Reverend Countryman is deeply connected to the Spirit and has presented meaningful information so to understand the importance of both ordained and lay ministries. The book is a pleasure to read and provides much to consider without becoming bogged down in too much technical jargon or thinking. This book has been a great blessing for me and was a terrific help in my discernment process.
1,Not what you would expect,"It describes this item as 100% cotton brocade. That's reallybending the truth. I am very disappointed in their decision todescribe this item less than accurately. The fabric is quite thinand plastic-like. It looks and feels like a Walmart, two-buck, rain poncho.The thin shiny material is so much like plastic that it makes crinkly noises when you move your arms. Brocade? Maybe technically they can say that,but it is not the brocade most people think of. The only reason I am not returning it, is because it is for a must-go-to, theme event that is only days away."
3,Great Book!,"A very good cold war yarn. Activities are centered on a location out of today's headlines; Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah, a military installation focused on Weapons of Mass Destruction research. An interesting thing happens at Dugway as a result of a seemingly off-handed comment by the leader of the USSR..."
3,I expected too much,"Is good for some one who has no experience with trucking business or any type of business at all,all is common sense.For me a waste of money"
4,Lime- Come and Get Your Love,"I was looking for the single ""Your Love"" by Lime and I found it on this CD. I had the 12"" record from back in the day and wanted it on disc. This disc has two songs on it - ""Your Love"" and ""Come and Get Your Love""- one version of each song is the radio air play version and the other is the long 12"" version. The sound is terrific! Just like I remember it. Ordering this CD was easy and I received it in 3 days without express shipping. I am very pleased with the product and the ease of ordering on Amazon.com. I will shop/buy more in the future."
2,Does not allow tab tops- how can that be!,What idiot designed a file box that will not accommodate file top labels. Nice looking box until you try to use it for the reason you bought it.
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I really don't like this product very much. It's rather flimsy & certainly not worth the money. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the lid isn't secure because it just rests on top of the files. I think that was an intentioal design but not a good one. If the quality was better, I could overlook it. If you're going to spend this kind of money, don't choose this product."
2,no much more than a cardboard box,"I was looking for a file cabinet, but realized they cost more than I wanted to spend right now ($100 to $200). So as an alternative I thought I would buy a file box that would look stylish and be in my price range as a temporary solution. The Cargo Naturals Dual file box is nothing more than a pretty cardboard box and it arrived with a dent in the side (showing how flimsy it is). I expected it to at least be coated with wax or something, but it's literally made of cardboard. For the quality of this product I would expect to pay about $10-15 not the $34 I paid. It does hold hanging file folders nicely and does look attractive, however I feel I paid 3 times more than what it's worth."
2,If only the lid fit better,"For those who don't want of need a regular file cabinet but need to store files that occasionally are accessed it works well. I have it on open shelves. The one drawback is the 'ill fitting' and poorly designed lid. It should have been deeper to allow for the file labels? Otherwise, it works. The lid non-function rates a two star item."
3,Not very sturdy,"We bought this to use for Cub Scouts for our graduation and bridging ceremonies. We liked it because it looks rustic and Cub Scout-ish. The handrails are very rough hewn, and would lend themselves easily to splinters if used as functional hand rails. The way they are cut, no amount of sanding is really going to fix it. The bridge rails and the fastening hardware are very flimsy if you want the bridge to be functional. We had to have a dad take it home to make it more substantial for kids to walk across. Yes, the price is good, and it looks more rustic than any of the other landscaping bridges out there, but be warned if you want to use it for more than decoration, you will likely need to make some adjustments to the hardware and the platform on your own."
1,Cedar bridge,"Didn't like this at all. All the rails were split, so there was no need in ever worrying about what it looked like assembled. i didn't measure, but it seemed short for what says 5 foot long."
1,not real pleased,I was disappointed with this product. The beads pinch and the vibration is not the greatest. It just took to much work and concentration making sure everything was in the right place. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,No excitement,Very weak and does not do any thing for the woman at all. Hopefully better batteries will help but not seeing how.
5,Awesome album!!,"A great buy for those who like progressive rock, like Circa Survive and Tides of Man. Hope to hear more things from these guys!"
4,Name-dropping fun!,"If you love horror, you will recognize just about every name in this suspenseful thrill-ride novel! Harry Shannon loves a good monster, and he puts his love to good use here, making a heady stew of werewolves, hired killers, a burned out ex-cop, a Hollywood studio employee, and others whose lives all come crashing to a halt in a town appropriately named Salt Lick. A not to be missed tour de force somewhat reminiscent of George Romero's zombie movies blended with 50s/60s monster flicks, due to the climactic battle at the end! A nicely done supernatural thriller!"
3,Bitter Sweet,"I was happy to find a continuation of the Westward trilogoy, and the first volumn ""Oregon Legacy"" was okay. But I was severly disappointed that the connection between the first volumn of the Holts picked up with the middle aged man ""Toby"", son of Whip Holt who was just a 5-year old of Jefferson Holt at the end of Outpost, the third book of the trilogoy. I expected the American Dynasty to pick up with Whip Holt, not just a token mention of him. A whole generation is lost to the reader. What a dissappointment."
1,It stunk...,"I totally agree with the other one star review. This book royally stunk worse than the garbage juice collecting at the bottom of a week old bag containing rotted garbage. To make this short, it was simply V.C. Andrews copied with boring, if not idiotic characters, and cheesy, awful dialogue. My dad's toe cheese could produce better work than this! At least it was given to me as a gift, so I at least didn't waste money on it. The only downside, though, is that it's still wasting space on my shelf. But I'm not so cruel as to give it to another poor victim...Avoid...Read Flannery O' Connor, Chuch Palahnuik, or Charlotte Bronte instead - at least they have real characters with grit! And original storylines to boot! Not to mention original prose and sentences..."
1,Dissapointing,"The book Even Angels Fall has a lot of potential, but never quite delivers on its promises. Nothing is fully explained, lots of time is spent on the building up of characters and plot, but then the book doesn't go anywhere as it rushes towards the end; begging the questions: Did Sherry Mauro run out of time? Space? Ideas?The idea was interesting enough to keep me reading hopefully through to the end, but by the last page it was disappointing, and a waste of time."
4,A THRILLING BESTSELLER!,"I thought this story was original and unique. Its about a lovely young woman named Sabrina Ayers who dreams of a better life. Her mother's family is scorned by the townspeople and Sabrina struggles to overcome adverstity. Then she meets a dashing, mysterious stranger, Richard...who is obsesssed with his dead mother's memory. But as they fall in love and everything ""seems"" perfect...Sabrina discovers his mother's diary in the attic of Richard's grieving old mansion, and she is able to unravel a dark unspeakable family secret!This is a must read for any mystery booklovers and women of all ages!"
4,"Better feeling than Converse, cheaper price","These Mia high tops go for much more elsewhere. At $13.79 they are a steal! When compared to the high top Converse chucks, they are much more cushioned and fashioned better. They seem to be a higher quality than the chucks yet are much less expensive. I recommend."
4,"Cutie Pie, but......","I do like the idea of this case for my Sansa mp3 player, but I had to do a bit of 'shaving' to the top so that my ear piece connection would fit. The top of the case is a bit thick, so had to do some carving of the rubber to remove some of the obstruction. Now it's just fine and CUTE! It's a fab idea to retro my player."
4,It's so cute,It has the feel and look of a sneaker and protects the Sansa well.The only issue is that it is thick and occasionally the buttons are hard to reach.
3,The missing song,"There are some decent songs in the movie. The best one, the one that the one reviewer mentions, that is played twice in the movie and as the credits roll...that song is not on the soundtrack. I hate when they do that. If it was good enought to play twice, why leave it off of the soundtrack. So, after 2 hours of process of elimination, that song that plays during the credits is Taper Jean Girl by the Kings of Leon. Great song. Steady pounding beat, very catchy song. I don't think he was referring to the System of the Down song Lonely Day (not Boy)."
3,"great cd, could be better!~ 2 missing songs!","correct me if i'm wrong...there are 2 awesome songs...missing!1. Lonely Day by system of a down2. Taper Jean Girl by kings of leonhmmmm...what's with that! 2 great songs are missing! i'm mad!yes, there are other good songs here, but why skip the best? the king (that's me) is puzzled! great movie however!"
3,I'm not convinced...,"We're really supposed to believe that a teenaged white boy (of 2007, that is) is sitting around listening to Minnie Riperton and Lou Rawls (or even know who they are)? Riiiiiight. What does he know about soul music?"
3,Not bad,"To me, this was a little slow moving. There was so much plot and not enough of how they fell in love and the relationship developing between them. It was a decent read with a little mystery, but I ended up wanting to know more about the interesting side characters than the main couple."
2,Disspointing book - for such a talented writer....,"I was very disappointed in this latest installment by Ms. Mullins. I have been a tried and true fan of all her previous books and I must say that I really found this lacking, even though I persevered in finishing it to see if there were any redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, I will have to agree with what some of the other reviewers have mentioned. The book stared well and it fizzled out.Lucy was somewhat of a whiner and some of her actions were rather idiotic. Simon is a hero character and you almost sympathize on him having to put up with her demeanor. I love Ms. Mullins books and am not deterred by this one, even though I was rather second-rate."
4,vote for pedro t shirt,Exactly what we were looking for. It is true to size and preshrunk. Nicely described and of very good quality.
5,"GREAT SHIRT,GREAT MOVIE!",Napoleon Dynomite is a hylarius movie! (my favorite) this shirt is a blast from the past.this shirt is a great conversation starter especially if u know someone named pedro and is running for class president!!!
4,Quick!,"I received this product within about 3 days (with standard shipping) which was impressive. Great quality but beware... it shrinks about a whole size in the dryer. Buy a size larger than you normally wear because it WILL shrink even though it claimed to be ""pre-shrunk"". Very realistic and durable, not see-through or thin. This would work well for costumes as well."
4,Vote For Pedro Tee,"Youth shirts run small, but I contacted the company and they immediately responded. I sent it back and got a larger size with no problem."
5,Excellent Read!,"This book is for every person who seeks balance amidst the hectic chaos of life. The author provides a humorous and dynamic example of how one can live life boldly and lustfully in this rush-hour world and still seek enlightenment and calmness of mind. Ken Taub's ability to find humor and humility in the telling of his own journey will resonate with anyone who has ever been a rebel at heart, yet wishes to find the middle path."
5,A Must Read for Beginning Budhists,There is always a conflict of how to pursue enlightenment within a culture of more. The author gives a solid summary of the methods amidst a great deal of humor how one individual can find their way on this very challenging journey.
5,very inspiring,"love the way he changed his life, i hope many people help themselves as i did happy new year and godbless everyone."
4,A comprehensive guide,"If you are planning to use the CotD in your campaign then this book is a must. Otherwise, the dracoliches, new monsters, dragon spells & deadly Sammaster created magic could liven any broken DM's dreams to crush an insolent party. I recommend this book because of it's possibilities, if fully explored by the right DM."
5,Stunning Video,"Just purchased this from Circuit City, and installed it. From the moment I used the S-Video output, my jaw has been on the floor. The output to tv is AMAZING to say the least, even with my 20"" CRT tv. That says a lot, not to mention that this thing can output to a monitor and tv both at once. In short, go buy this now!"
2,"Good size & specs, but tore within 24 hours","The bag is large and very functional, I really like it. However, it seems quite poorly made: it tore on my first trip - my finger went straight through the stitching as I was carrying it. My previous duffel bag (another brand) lasted 10+ years of sometimes very rough conditions, it's very disappointing to see this one fail so soon. Not recommended."
3,Good So Far,"I am on my first leg of my trip from Iraq to Chicago and so far the quality is good. I just bought a J-world bag and it didn't last one trip b-4 it fell apart!!! My only complaints are there is no shoulder strap,the handle could be longer, and the end compartment are kind of useless except to put dirty cloths in. They sould delete one of them to put a shoulder strap on it and make it so it can stand upon its own."
3,Better than previous model,I have written a previous review of a High Sierra Wheeled Duffel model (red) which was more of a canvas type where I mentioned it was punctured and stained on the first trip. This model is made of a different material (synthetic?) and appears to withstand the punishment (first trip) and was not punctured but it did suffer some staining. The bag was big enough for me with a lot of room to spare (expands). It is light weight and easy to roll. I feel it is a huge improvement over the previous model and hopefully it will last me through many more trips.
4,Marine Officer's Guide,I accepted my commission this summer and found this book helpful because it addressed some of the customs and history of the United States Marine Corps all in one location. The book is well organized and each chapter can be read on its own. Good overview of the basics. The history portion is superficial. I'm wondering if a more recent edition should be available since this book is several years old.
4,Officers' Guide,I have been using the 3rd edition since 1972. The 6th edition by Lieutenant Colonel Estes is a tremendous improvement though Chapter 22 Marine Corps Social Life is still antiquated and reeks of the 19th Century. I did not observe the use of calling cards once in my thirty year career.
4,Informative,"Dry, but informative. Do not pay more than the $50 or $60 that Amazon asks. It is certainly not worth the several hundred dollars that some are asking. Sorry the review isn't longer, but this pretty much some up my feelings. Meh..."
2,Fine Film Horrible Version,"I second the other reviewer. This is a very good movie about a very dark time in British intellingence. The acting is top notch and the story is dead on. The biggest critisism is that this version on DVD is VERY POOR. It is a bargain bin quicky that was thrown on a DVD to exploit the popularity, at the time, of Anthony Hopkins who had hit it big as Hannibal Lechtor. I will seek out a quality copy because I really find the story fascinating. That said, if you are looking for James Bond or some kind of comic book spy movie you will be disappointed. This is the real deal, with real people in a true story. John LeCarre' fans will enjoy."
5,"franks zoo , card game","Whats in the box is all you need to play (no need to buy more, not collectible).Its a really fun game for people of all ages."
1,do not waste your money,this product was recommended to me by an associate at home depot. i used the product according to the directions and i am still overrun with chinch bugs. product claims to kill on contact. what a joke.
4,The tears flow...,"I have to say, I am sad it's over. Sarah Ash has given me many hours of good reading and I cherished them all. This book I found a little different than the previous two in that things were moving along at a standard pace and the next thing you know; bam, bam, bam, it's over. It seemed like she just decided it was time to finish it, so she did. Don't get me wrong I loved it, but I felt like she left a few things out. Sarah hasn't really kept any secrets in the books and when she did they were eventually revealed. Not the case with this book unfortunately. Perhaps I missed it, but I want to know what happened with Kaspar Linnaius. Heck, I'd like to see a book about nothing but him. I hope Sarah continues to write quality material like she has, if she does..... I'll read em'. I would suggest putting an extra fifty pages in to finish the book and give us the imagery and story we love and honestly for reading the two previous books...deserve."
1,Controller does not work,"I was very excited to receive this toy, when it arrived batteries were placed and the controller which is seperate in the packaging was put in place. The game powered on but the contoller does not work. Now we have a worthless game."
1,Creepy,"I can see why people talk about the creativity in this movie. It is not like anything I have seen before. However, the ""creativity"" is actually quite frightening to both my child and myself. This movie is creepy. I would not recommend this to anyone. The only value this movie may have is for a child who is very serious about dance lessons to be able to watch the footwork."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter and was excited to get it after reading several rave reviews (including one in a magazine.) Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. This didn't keep the attention of my daughter or my 5 year old son. I even found it boring. Most of the songs have only one set of feet dancing to them. I thought there would be several pairs of feet dancing to each song which I believe would have kept us all a little more entertained - sort of like ""Riverdance"" only without the upper body. This was definitely a waste of money. It is slow paced and lacks the ""wow"" factor I was looking for."
2,Picture is confussing,"I was confussed by the picture. I thought I was getting a 54"" crate. Now I have a divider, with no crate. :("
3,good product except the lid won't stay latched,I like this contained except I literally have to punch the latch for it to stay closed. I would not recommend.
1,Just what I need--more paper!,"I realize that managing my own health and health records is important, but this book/product/ service seems likes its taking the issue to extremes. After reviewing it, I had to tell my myself honestly that I would not take the time to complete all of the information that is required both for the initial pass and to keep it updated. Perhaps if I had a chronic medical condition or did not trust my physician I'd find it more useful, unfortunately I'm afraid that this will find a dust-collecting space on my bookshelf, until I toss it--uncompleted.There is some good information here, but nothing that I have not gotten from my own physicians. My health records have followed me consistently and reliably throughout my many moves."
5,Good Radio!!!!,I got this Radio for my brother. He loves to listen radio with a good quality voice. He loved this radio and he told me that he can treasure this radio for a long time.
3,"Works great, but...",There needs to be some sort of a protective sleeve to store drives when they are removed from the enclosure.
3,Daughter Loves it,"My four year old loves it, I was not overly impressed. Had some issues installing on Windows XP computer, indicated on the box that it works with XP, but I had to uninstall and then reinstall before I could get it working. Also, noticed some odd things with the game. Directions were not always clear on what they should be doing. I was literally stuck with her on a level for 10 minutes because we couldn't figure out how slow they wanted us to move the mouse. Kind of crazy really."
1,The drivers don't work on XP PCs - Camera doesn't work,"As a result, you'd never even find out if the camera itself works. There's no place to download updated drivers (for those who hope they can get it to work).Notice the only good reviews about this product are copy pasted from some user with multiple logins to Amazon?!"
1,Innovage Mini Digital Camera,"This product is extremely frustrating and hardly worth the effort. The majority of them don't even come with the necessary drivers and software to even make them work and they are not plug and play. By the time you find the drivers, you could have bought a better camera worth your time and money. The quality is only a little better than a cellphone camera."
2,Overrated Camera,"I was looking for a inexpensive camera to help with my job on a school publications team. When i stumbled upon this camera, I was amazed how cute and useful it looked. But, once it arrived in the mail it turned out to be too small and not DIGITAL at all. The look-through viewfinder is just a small piece of plastic you push up. Also, it only holds 20 pictures at a time! I recommend this for young children (Ages 7-9), but not for anyone else. It is better to spend a couple hundred and get a more efficient camera! Hope my review helped you with your decision!"
1,We live and learn!,"I bought one of these a while back. I didn't expect it to be have the performance of a more deluxe model, but I figured it was an inexpensive way to get used to digital photography.I had no trouble installing the software, but the camera itself wouldn't work on my system (I have XP professional). In fact, the system had to do some error correction. I went to the web page to see if there was updated software to make the camera compatible with my system -- and I had to subscribe to some online stuff in order to get it -- and even then, I didn't know if it would work.I am now saving up my pennies for a better digital camera. And I'm just glad that it didn't damage my system.Caveat emptor -- let the buyer beware!"
1,Piece of junk!,"After looking all over the internet on how to get it to work because of installation problems, I finally get a message on my computer that I cannot use this device because it will ruin my PC."
2,Mini Camera,"Purchased as a gag gift, and at this price didn't expect much. I understand that the camera is actually supposed to work, but the instructions that came with this one were so brief and vague, we could never figure them out. Better instructions would have made it a better value I think. No complaints for the price."
1,This camera sucks!,"I received this camera as a gift, so I just write my opinion in order to advise you not to spend any money by purchasing this camera. It sucks! the quality of the photos is terrible, there are the worst pictures I have ever seen in my life: for the same price you can buy a conventional camera of 35 mm and you will get much better pictures and a better camera. Do not buy this camera cause you will waste your money, it's completely useless."
1,Caveat Emptor,"We wanted a camera for our 4-year-old and my husband talked me out of getting something sturdier and $20 more expensive, not to mention more age-appropriate. Right out of the box, he admits he made a mistake (thereby making itself worth every penny, thank you). You have no way to see what picture you're taking, except through a lilliputian window. There's no digital panel to show you your shot.It took way too much fiddling and jiggering to get it to take a few fuzzy, black-and-white pics before it went on to the Big Photo Lab in the Sky. Its carcass made for a fun toy to toss around and play at taking photos until it was made to disappear by the Recycling Fairy.Naturally, this is somehow my fault for agreeing to the whole thing. Now you know."
1,A cheap very poor quality camera,"I would not recommend this ""camera"" to anyone. The quality of the pictures is so grainy and difficult to view. Also the software has very few functions.... I would recommend you spend the extra money and go for one with quality pictures."
3,not great...but not totally useless,"It's really cheap, so I wasn't going into it thinking it was going to take awesome pictures. It ate up my first battery wtihin a week, and I didn't use it that much. It works much better as a digital camera or if you leave it hooked up to your computer while you take pictures. (Thankfully I havea laptop)You kind of have to have what you're taking a picture of exactly centered in the viewfinder or else it will get cut off.Not the best thing, but if your'e looking for something cheap, it can be useful if you're not looking to spend a lot of money. Just don't go into it thinking it's going to work great or take amazing pictures."
3,"Overall, bad... But for a keychain camera... ehhh....","It is what it is first of all: a key chain. This is far from anything in the mega pixel range and I'm sure the lens is cheap plastic. The software sucks and I recommend 3rd party drivers. It will not take pictures indoors AT ALL, they turn out completely black. However, it is nice to have on your key chain to snap a quick picture if you're in a hurry. It could compete with some bad camera phone's quality. Don't take important photos, just quick things you don't have a better camera for at the moment. It's sort of like a post-it note vs a high quality notebook. For writing an essay, a post-it note wont do the job. What post-it notes are good for are quick jotting down and thats sort of what this camera is. Over $15, ripoff. Under $15 and you wont feel so bad."
3,"Not good, but cheap","I bought these cameras for my nieces age 9 and 7. The cameras do not take great photos - they're dark and blurry, and the cameras lack a preview feature (of course they'd be more expensive if they had it). That said, they are cheap and better than kid cameras out there. You get what you pay for."
2,It's exactly what you expect,"It takes lousy pictures, there's no flash, and if you want anything even decent you need to use the highest resolution which only allows for 20 pictures before you run out of memory.But, it is technically a digital camera. If you're too cheap to buy a camera phone or you want a fun gadget for your keychain and have $10 to blow, give it a try."
1,Definite piece of garbage!,"I recieved this camera from my parents as a Christmas gift the day before yesterday. At first, I thought it was a cool camera, being small & all.. When I tried using it though, I was very disappointed. There was no flash, so I had to make my own lighting just to take pictures indoors. When I did take pictures, the picture came out HORRIBLE! The picture quality was the worst that I had seen, & this was from a supposedly hi resolution picture.If anyone even thinks of getting this camera, I advise you not to. The price might be great, but the camera isn't."
2,not COMPLETELY worthless,"The resolution of 640 x 480 is adequate for small photos. Downloading the pictures requires their special front end software, which is a pain, but works fine.I bought this for my kids to use so we wouldn't run the risk of damaging the ""real"" digital camera. Unfortunately, the camera needs perfect conditions to take good pictures, so their pictures turn out dark or blurry.If you want a digital camera for a youngster and you think that all of the pictures can be taken in bight light with no motion (from either the object or the shooter) then this camera might work for you. But since many no-zoom ""real"" cameras are under $100 now, you're probably better off going that route."
1,Junk - barely even qualifies as a toy,"This thing belongs in the 99 cent store. Its probably more valuable in parts. If you paid more than $5, then you should have saved up for a real camera. This barely even qualifies as a toy."
1,Not worth it,It bought the same camera at Walgreens for $10 and it is not even worth that amount. The photos come out extremely hazy and small. The pictures are worse than the ones on my cameraphone. And there is no little LCD screen for you to see what you are taking a picture of.
2,This Book Was a Massive Disappointment,"I was very optimistic when I bought that book but after trying a few of the recipes, that enthusiasm disappeared. The recipes are terrible. I cannot recommend this book."
2,Great photos,"I really enjoyed the book only for the pictures and I used the pictures as inspiration.Yes, the first reviewer was right about the repetitive pictures and the horrible grammars. This book did not have enough information on how to garden in the containers! Everything was cut very short and limited, as if it was written by a twelve year old!If you need few great inspirations from the pictures, save your money and borrow this book from a library. It is worth to read for a bit and make some new ideas for your backyard or your garden."
2,Not so great,"While undoubtedly full of helpful information, this book's writing style is so inaccessible and so patently full of grammatical error that any such useful information is difficult to appreciate. The full-color photographs are nice, but they tend to repeat throughout the book, and they just can't make up for the writing."
4,20 quart stainless steel stock pot,"This worked great for making the must that will eventually become my mead (honey wine). If you have large batches you need to cook, this is a good, inexpensive stock pot to get. Just be cautious not to burn anything as the bottom is only a single ply."
4,Cheap but not the cheapest,"I bought this item because I needed a large pot for home cheesemaking, wanting something that I could use with 4 or 5 gallons of milk at a time. This fit the bill nicely, and had a pretty decent pricetag for something in stainless steel (granted it is only a thin 1-ply pot). Evidently it's not the absolute cheapest though, because I noted another 20 qt pot at my local supermarket for $19.99. Oh well."
5,Gordon Beck is one of the finest Jazz pianists ever!!,"This live DVD recorded in 1991 from England shows the creativity and amazing abilities of one of the worlds finest Jazz pianists, Mr. Gordon Beck. Gordon is augmented by Kenny Wheeler on trumpet and flugelhorn and together with the rest of the band including Dieter Ilg on Bass and Tony Oxley on drums they pay tribute to one of Gordon Beck's influences, Bill Evans. There are some Bill Evans pieces featured as well as some of Gordon Beck's own compositions.If you are a Jazz fan, a Gordon Beck fan, or a lover of Bill Evans than this DVD is for you!!"
4,5 Stars and 3 Stars,"10 stars for the scenery and photography. 3 stars for the story.4 stars for the acting. Can't rate the DVD's quality - cuz I have not tried one. And a good old film of its era - I appreciate it for its' vintage style. But the scenery of this movie is awesome. And for that, (for me), gives me quite a bit to appreciate."
5,WONDERFULLY UNREALISTIC!,"A WONDERFOL TALE OF ADVENTURE AND ROMANCE FROM AN AGE WHEN REALISM WASN'T AS IMPORTANT AS TELLING A GOOD STORY. SURE, REAL COWBOYS WEREN'T LIKE THIS AND REAL CATTLE DRIVES DIDN'T HAPPEN THIS WAY AND FRONTIER WOMEN SURE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE JANE RUSSEL, BUT WHO CARES? THIS MOVIE WAS MADE BACK WHEN MOVIES WERE MEANT TO ENTERTAIN, NOT EDUCATE, AND IT CERTAINLY DOES THAT. CLARK GABLE IS THE ONLY MOVIE COWBOY TO ALMOST MEASURE UP TO JOHN WAYNE, AND THIS IS GABLE AT HIS COWBOY BEST. ENJOY IT."
5,"The Tall Men, a classic western","A collector's item, ""The Tall Men"" is a classic movie that belongs on all western fans' DVD shelves! Clark Gable and Jane Russell make a superb screen couple. Enjoy..."
1,What went wrong?,"This film should have been much better. Nobody is believable in this film. Especially Jane Russel is terrible with her coiffures and gowns. She is good in comedy, but not here. The story is very weary. One of the all time worst ones. Check it, if you want."
2,What Every Boy Wants To Be And Every Old Man Wishes He Was,"Clark Gable and Cameron Mitchell star as brothers and cowboys who first try to rob businessman Robert Ryan, but end up partners with him in a huge cattle drive from Texas to Montana. Along the way they pick up Jane Russell, who falls in love with Gable, but wants the rich lifestyle that Ryan can provide.The story is hardly short on action. There's blizzards, Indian attacks, cattle drives, and plenty of male/female friction. But it doesn't add up to anything particularly exciting or even interesting. It was a surprise to me, given not only the cast, but also the director Raoul Walsh, who certainly knew his way around action and adventure, not to mention how to pace a film. There are a few good moments, especially the final drive with the cattle, but not enough to sustain any interest in the characters or the story. The actors are fine, but the missing energy really hurts the film. It's a large scale Western, but the scale doesn't impress."
2,A bloated western,"I really wonder what the other reviewers saw in this picture. Jane Russell with her unruffled skirts and coiffures belongs to an another film. She was O.K. with Bob Hope, but not with Gable and Ryan. This is one of the worst films made with a lot of money. The story is full of cliches. Brian Garfield wrote very harshly about it in his excellent guide about western films. The Tall Men is a ""disappointingly hackneyed and mediocre, bloated far beyond its proper scale: overlong, underscripted, flabbily directed and downwright silly"". I agree with his opinion."
4,Great Clark Gable Western,"Gable only made a handful of Westerns, but this ranks as his best period Western film. He plays a former Confederate who leads a cattle drive with brother Cameron Mitchell. Gable And Mitchell have formed an uneasy partenrship with Robert Ryan (who they tried to rob at the beginning of the film). Ryan is also romancing Jane Russell, whose a former flame of Gable's. She joins them on the cattle drive, much to the dismay of Gable, who doesn't want a woman along because it's dangerous, but who's also still brokenhearted over his and Russell's parting.This is a very nice western with great scenery, good performances, and a simply smoldering performance by Russell in one of the alltime sexiest women's roles in a Western. Catch it when you can."
4,GREAT RAOUL WALSH WESTERN,"A sweeping cinemascope adventure thematically consistent with Mister Walsh's style.Clark Gable, Jane Russell,Robert Ryan and Cameron Mitchell are all excellent.Indian attacks,blizzards, men, women, their libidos and one long cattle drive provide the tension contained within near perfection."
3,Cute toy,"The faces are pretty cute, not weird-looking like some miniature dolls. Three stars because Laverna's head snapped off the first day, but with gentler play they will be fine. The size is so cute and fits well in my 3-yr olds hands and she now realizes that to keep Elina's head on she will need to be a little more gentle. **Toys-R-Us has these for $9.99. These are products currently F(2/2007 pre-Rainbow movie release) available at a wide variety of brick and mortars; there is no need to pay $20 or more."
2,"Cute, but not very durable","The first set we got lasted 1 day before a leg fell off Elina. The the Enchantress's head snapped off without anyforce from my daughters. The second set, Elinas head snapped off after 10 days and Sunburst head snapped after 12 days. My girls are not very tough on toys. These are cute and they have enjoyed them, but I will not be purchasing a third set. Hope this helps."
3,its alright,There are too many pieces. it's a hassle to put back together every time my daughter take it apart to chew on it. i would not recommend it.
2,Wouldn't purchase these for kids under 3,"We returned these because the letters popped out. We were buying them for our daughter , 6 mos, so she would have a soft surface to crawl on. However, the letters kept popping out. This item would be great if they did not pop out."
1,ABC Mat,I thought the Pieces were Larger! I Paid way to Much for this ABC Mat ($54) only to see it at Walmart for $12! What a Rip Off!!!
2,Not the greatest quality,"I bought this for our twins to play on in the living room but it curls and pulls apart easily. it also came missing two letters, strange. Bought a similar one at Costco and the quality is much better."
1,Not what I expected,"I returned this foam rug the day I got it. I knew that each letter square was individual and connected to the other letter squares. What I didn't know, is that the letters in each square pop out and some letters are more than one piece. Not only do the letters pop out of their square, but they pop out very easily. It was a joke, you couldn't sit or walk on it without the letters popping out of their square."
3,Missing Parts!!!,"The stand in and of itself is strong and works well, or so it seems. I have not been able to sit in it since it arrived. The shipping box arrived in pieces and 2 of the screws were nowhere to be found. Very disapointing to say the least."
1,Not what I was hoping for,"I just got this product this afternoon. It was much larger and heavier than I had expected, and would not fit in the place on my porch I had planned to put it. It seems to be about six feet across and is much too tall.It is also poorly machined - some of the parts can't be put together all the way, and the holes that hold the upper section on are too small to fit the bolts through. Also, paint is knocked off in places, with rust showing underneath."
1,Waiting for delivery,"I ordered the Omni chair stand last spring 2005.I paid for it with my Visa, and have yet to see the delivery."
3,Product Information,"I was unable to get any information on the assembled dimensions of this product. Since the manufacturer could not provide dimensions, I could not be sure of the sturdiness and/or size, so I could not proceed with ordering the product.Since then, customer reviews of the actual product have helpfully provided the assembled size, enabling me to purchase with confidence."
1,Not for shorter people!!!,"I am 5'6"" and this stand does not work for me. If my hammock chair was set at a height I could get into, then when I sat in it I ""bottomed out"" and hit the stand where the 3 feet connect. You must be tall to get full use/swing of this stand. ... one of 2 screw holes did not line up so I couldn't get full support, and ... it was all scrapped up and after just 2 days outside (one of which rained) it was starting to rust!!! ..."
3,needs some retooling,"The thing is LARGE ! Box arrived a little banged up but everything inside was OK. Putting it together was a hassle as one of the legs did not line up and I needed some tools to open up the holes a bit. Would not fit inside the house as the top was reaching my ceiling, and the legs were not level. Brought it outside to complete the assembly and hung the chair. It stands too far off the ground! You have to step up on the legs to get into the chair. Maybe after we move it on to the lawn it will sit lower. Once in, it seems sturdy, and the slight bounce is nice.The picture on the site is deceiving as it is much larger than it looks."
2,Does it need to be so large?!,"If you order it make sure you have enough space. I couldn't find the size of this stand anywhere, and since it was the only hammock-chair stand for sale I gave it a try. It is so big it cannot fit in my balcony! I will have to wait till I get a garden. I also got problems for the delivery, they had me wait one entire day for nothing, hang up on me on the phone...When I finally received the package it was in bad shape, the content was OK but very very dirty."
4,Great coffee-table book AND a good overview,"I am fortunate enough to have supported the Hubble Space Telescope (helping with testing the ground system at the Goddard Space Flight Center), so I bring an extra level of interest to this book.Which book provides a detailed background on HST, from the first notions of a telescope in space through the problems with the mirror and its resolution. It then goes into the astronomy that has been and is being done with the spacecraft, providing copious and interesting detail along with the breathtaking photographs that HST has become famous for.The result is both a great coffee-table book (for the photographs) and a worthwhile overview of current astronomy and what's being investigated. Recommended."
2,McQueen,My son didn't like having to shake as much as you had to in order to keep it going. He got bored with it.
1,"Old, expired, stinky.","I can't confirm but it seems to me this cream is getting harder and harder to find in stores because they may be discontinuing it.. In any case the type I ordered here didn't come in the usual bottle I'm used to (as seen on left) and it smelled old, not fresh. Anyone who has kept lotion too long knows the aroma I'm talking about. If lotions had an expiration date this would be way past its time..."
1,The halter pulls too much,The halter pulls too much on my neck for this body stocking to be wearable. It's definately not comfortable to wear for anything other than just standing and taking a picture.
4,VERY SEXY ...,"I gave it only 4 stars because it slightly had a cut before i even put it on !! but it is VERY sexy n my husband just loved it,, i was worried because i'M 190 pounds and 5'4 but it fits more than perfect and i felt reeeeaally sexy in it =)!! i recommend it to all z couples who want to spice up their sex life a bit ;)"
1,This is not a receiver tube cover,"This looks like what I wanted, but it is smaller. I don't know what it is, but it is not a receiver tube cover."
3,Loomans review of Eyewitness travel guide great place in europe,"This book has been a lifesaver. Although there is plenty of hotel information available on the internet, this would require some pre-planning. There is no substitute for simply having the addresses and phone numbers available in a book when travelling by car. The book lists quality places in the various touristic areas of Europe. When traveling in the off-season, you can simply rely on the book for last minute reservation while in the area.Frank Loomans"
1,Not worth it.,"We chose this stroller because we were looking for something that was easily maneuverable. We walked all around the store with it - but there's the problem. The store is perfectly flat and even. The stroller pitches forward any time we hit any kind of bump - we don't even like it on the sidewalk, let alone anywhere else.In short, this stroller is perfect for mall-walking. Nothing else."
5,inexpensive gun case solution,I have a few of these wrapping pieces I don't want to get scratched up in storage or on the way to the field. It will provide cushion for field piece. Trier is room for scopes in it. Just not sure how much protection or cushion for scopes are in one. They are an inexpensive case. They will fit a short rifle to a 54' or plus piece just draw the string and wrap the case around the butt of the gun.
4,Simple Solution,These work as you would expect. A simple sock with material thick enough to provide some protection. I was able to fit these over optics with some coaxing.
4,Red Shea...,"Just to add something to the previous reviews. I've heard that Bert Jansch from pentangle is considered the ""hendrix of the acoustic guitar"". I disagree. After to listening to the early Gordon Lightfoot Albums I really don't think anyone can touch the lead runs and gentle acoustic melodies produced by my fellow Countymen Red Shea. As a canadian I may be biased but feel that Red Shea is often overlooked as one of the greatest guitarists period."
5,Great Lightfoot Album!,"The two albums, 'Did She Mention My Name/Back Here On Earth (Beat Goes On)', seem like they're meant to be together. The music flows together well, and it could have been released as a double album.The music is great. If you like Gordon's more folky side, then you will love these two albums. They are both filled with the strength of a rising star."
5,Great Gord,"I wore out both of these albums when they were only available on vinyl.Every song on each is a winner,but if you want to hear one of the most beautiful,poignant,day-dream inducing songs:""Pussywillows,Cattails"" is it.It has been thirty years since I first heard it,and to this day,each time I listen,I am immediately transported back to my youth,and falling in love,and peaceful summer days.I think it is the most perfect love-song ever written,without the word ""love"" even in it.Give it a try.You won't be disappointed.Both albums are typical Gord: Perfection."
3,What about personal property (car) taxes?,"I was shocked when I recently moved to South Carolina and found that the state has a personal property tax on cars. Consequently, it is not uncommon for the Annual Property Tax on a newer car to Exceed a Thousand Dollars ($1000.00 +). This is a considerable tax burden that does not appear to be covered in the book."
4,What happened to the software?,Still a great book. A one of a kind. I also have the 1993 print of Places Rated. It came with a program that allowed you to define your own rankings.
2,List-o-philia!,"As long as Americans are in love with lists and insecure about keeping up with their neighbors (in some far off state in this case)...books like this will continue to prosper, regardless of whether they actually make sense.I found the weather section less than helppful as it didn't give any real information (days above 90 degrees snowfall etc) but opted for a 50 page breakdown of ""regional weather environments""??Not taking into concideration that weather can change signifigantly between neighboring cities just a few dozen miles apart.I wrote them to express my dissatisfaction with this and other aspects and I was told that a new edition will be on shelves next year and that I should just buy the next one and hope for the best.I donated the book to my local library."
4,"Well organized, covers many areas, a few ""typos"".","I found this book to be very helpful in the area of comparison, that is I could easily compare the statistics for those few places that I personally had in mind. The areas that summarize a particular category are well laid out. The graphics in the Climate section are helpful, although I did notice a significant mistake (I think)... Those of you looking at the two Charlestons ( SC and WV), it looks like the Climatic graphics and statistics were switched for these two cities. Quite a shocker to see that Charleston, SC gets 32 inches of snow a year! If anyone connected to the publisher can confirm that with me, it would be appreciated. It is also very helpful to have previous editions so that you can compare changes in a locations scores for the 1997 edition vs. the 1993 or 1989 edition. I have collected all 3. Overall, a very good source."
3,You can't quantify quality of life in a city,"The book does a great job of laying out statistical differences between places, such as population, crime statistics, and the like, but provides very little in what makes a place a good place to live. Are the people friendly? Are the school districts responsive to parents? Are there significant racial tensions? In short, you can't quanitify quality of life."
3,Unlike previous volumes,"While full of arcane but useful info, this edition does not do as good a job of evaluating/comparing taxation and cost-of-living as previous volumes. If $$$ data is important to you I would suggest CITIES RANKED & RATED, 2nd ed. Bert Sperling & Peter Sander"
3,Not as good as prior versions of this book,Had an old version of the book and do not like the way information is layed out as much as prior version. The selection of region rather than city is not good on some data fields since the region is too large. Better to report city by city. Also found several errors on the climate section (where high and low temperatures for a city climate were the same for example). Still has a lot of useful data though.
4,fascinating with room for improvement,"This is a great book. I thouroghly enoyed it and have taken into consideration a great portion of it's contents in my own relocation plans. I will say however that 2 things could/should be added by way of improvement. First, How about terrain/topography? Yes, they give a shallow treatment of the subject in conjunction with their climate chapter, but I found it extremely lacking. I live in a region of Texas where the terrain is, I think, boring and barren (which combined with the weather, creates, in my mind, a highly undesireable place to live) I want to know what a prospective place to live LOOKS LIKE. Also, how about pollution? Air, water etc.????? As another person mentioned in His/her review, this most certainly, absolutely, plays a key role in the decision making process. Still, notwithstanding, loved the book."
3,Liked my '89 edition better.,"This edition is not as user friendly as my old one (which has been very well used). The print is faint..my old one is very bold, and I miss the graphs and monthly average temps in the climate section. I liked the way the transportation section was set up in the older version..everything reached out and grabbed you..you have to strain to pick up info in the new one. All that blue background has got to go! The area with city contacts-emails was a nice touch. The book allows you to compare different areas in every way imaginable and in a fun way - armchair traveling. It's still the best of it's kind out there."
4,great for reapiring damged threads,"I have used several of the Helicoil kits before, but never the 1/4 inch one. This one also works great, but the kit does not include the 17/64 drill bit needed. Since that is not a common size included in most drill indexes, or stocked in most hardware stores, you will need to order it separately or else buy the kit that includes it."
5,Easy! Works!,"Five starts for ease and resultI had stripped threads for a bracket inside the stern of a small boat, hard to tell what it was until doing some ""surgery."" I determined that it was about 3/8"" thick, probably steel, and worth tapping, so I bit the bullet.Tried JB weld first to make threads: *bzzzt* FAILNext stop, Helicoil. SO easy, it seemed to good to be true. Drill out, quick. Tapping was a bit dicey; I have NEVER tapped threads before, and it was hard to turn at first, then real easy, like it had stripped (it had not). Still, easy. Helicoil screwed right in; being inside it was a little hard to see when to stop turning it in, but no big deal. With such a thin bracket there was a narrow ""sweet spot."" Bolt went right in, not to loose, not too snug. Done.Prosquick and easyenough inserts for many more fixessaved me LOTS of time and moneyConsenough inserts for many more fixes = $$ (cheaper kit with fewer inserts would be nice)need your own 17/64 drill, which is in most bigger drill sets"
4,Hip hop or NOT..... still a good series!!!!!!!!!,"I dont like Hip Hop or Rap but it really didnt bother me whenI watched this series. The animation is top notch! Cant beat it. The silly character is lame, It could have been more serious I thought but still a great series. If you like BeBop check this out."
5,One of the most well done and original anime series ever,"Samurai Champloo has to be one of the best new anime series I've seen in the past few years. The characters are a bit predictable, Mugen and Jin being the samurai equivalent of The Odd Couple, and Fuu as the always expected damsel in distress, but the plot and over storyline is what makes this great. The hip/trip-pop and J-Pop soundtrack is well done, unfortunately, the soundtrack seems to be missing numerous tracks, I was someone disappointed after purchasing it.For anyone who followed Cowboy Bebop, I think this series will definitely win you over as well. Shinichiro Watanabe defintely left his mark with this series. I can highly recommend this for anyone who enjoyed Cowboy Bebop or is looking for something refreshingly new."
5,'Kenshin' meets 'Pulp Fiction',"I loved it. Absolutely loved it. I'm not one to purchase alot of anime nor to give five stars lightly, but, yea, this one's up there.Its a delightful mix of fighting, story, comedy, and epic. The characters are very fun and, surprisingly, not at cliche as I expected. Its just all around fun, unexpected and refreshing for fans of the genre for sure!"
5,Samurai Champloo - Just Shut Up & Watch =P,"From the director Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Animatrix) Comes a new Hip Anime series featuring yet again a set of Hilarious characters, on a quest to find "" The Samurai that smells of Sunflowers "" ? Odd but it'll add up as the DVDs are released. Great Sword fights mixed in with as always hilarious consequences and superb Music. Fans of the fabled Cowboy Bebop and Classic Rurouni Kenshin are going to love this. So just shut up and watch! I would also like to add the Series Box and Limited Edition Bandana are well worth getting, the box holds all 7 Volumes."
3,Decent but lacking,"This anime starts out really really cool. I liked the animation style and the colors. The problem with this anime though is that it gets old really fast. Most all the episodes I saw had the travelers stumbling into a town hungry, pawning weapons for food, acting out the plot, then earning their weapons back. It happened over and over again without ever furthering the story. I could'nt really take it any more. Also, beatboxing breakdancing samurai is kinda pushin it. There are much better samurai animes out there."
1,all action... no substance,"all action... devoid of any siginficant ""truths."" What a sad state of affair... the predominant characteristic definining all of humanity.go back to cowbow bebop."
5,One of the best episodic series ever...of any genre!,"Yes, i know this is a cartoon, but I just found it to be wonderful. This was my first Japanese anime experience, and from what I've heard and seen since, I think I started with the best! You know a show is special when you truly miss it once it ends. It's witty, full of good action, a great road movie, suspenseful, and has a great ""underground"" hip-hop soundtrack. This is just great tv. I wish it was available to stream instantly, amazonprime!!!"
5,THE history of the 101st!,"Before i start... is where you will have to go to find this and other older unit histories. now...This is the only necessary history of the famed 'screaming eagle' division during WW2. Written by two platoon leaders of the 101st, right after the war, and with complete access to all division records, are 3 reasons why this is the only book you need on the 101st. It covers, completely, the history of training and combat during the war, from the top brass decisions before Normandy to the individual stories from the foxholes surrounding Bastogne. In fact, much of the book is taken from other memoirs, published by actual soldiers of the 101st, like Webster and Koskimaki. If you have any interest in this famous division then you need to find this book at ... and pick it up. You won't be sorry..."
5,UPDATE,I put an address in my above review where you can find this book but it was taken out...write me at reihm@yahoo.com to find out where to buy this book...
5,Which album was this?,"I love Ottmar, and I have all of his CD's. This was his first, and you'll know that after you have listened to all the others. Melodies created here are continued on most subsequent CDs.In fact, that's my biggest frustration with Ottmar: I can't tell his albums apart. In fact, it's very sad to say that his phenominal guitar playing, haunting melodies, creative percussion and unique arrangements all sound the same after 6 CDs. It's not that the music isn't good -- in fact, it's great. But darn it if half the tracks on ""Opium"" or ""Hours Between Night and Day"" don't sound just like the ones here.Still, I couldn't live without at least a few of his works, and this earlier CD plus ""Solo Para Ti"" or ""Nuevo Flamenco"" will leave you wanting more."
5,Solstice Wood is terrific!!!,"Sylvia Lynn is Rois' (from Winter Rose) four times great granddaughter and Lynn Hall has been left to her after the death of her grandfather. She has moved a continent away from Lynn Hall and her grandparents, because like Rois and Corbet she is half- fay. Her grandmother Iris has been the leader of the Fiber Guild, which she describes as a sewing circle, but it's more of a coven about fear -- and good food-- and binding up the rents between this world and the Otherworld.Owen, Sylvia's near -relation thinks:""The heir to Lynn Hall had just walked out of the world into fairyland. The heir to Lynn Hall, born to guard, and watch, and keep all passageways locked againsr the wood- folk, was one of them herself. And one of us.And so was the young man who had stolen my daughter's heart.""This is an excellent tale, well worth reading and owning. I liked the varying POV and contemporary setting very much."
3,ok read,"Sylvia Lynn is called home to her grandparents' house for her grandfather's funeral. Having left as soon as she was old enough, Sylvia lives on the other side of the country where she owns a bookstore. Her plan is to stay long enough to bury her grandfather and then head back home, but the strange happenings around the house pull her into its mysteries. Trying to hide her past from her grandmother, Sylvia tries to hold the webs keeping her family intact together - facing a world and history she's been running from since childhood. I chose this one because it looked interesting, and I enjoyed it as a fantasy novel, but it wasn't a favorite."
3,"Readable, but not her best work","I adore Winter Rose, just as I adore most of McKillip's work, and I was looking forward to this title.It's--ok. McKillip's prose is, as ever, beautiful. Sylvia and the Changeling are both interesting characters, and there is some truly haunting material here.However, the fact remains that McKillip is not really suited to writing with a Message (I can't think of any author that is, really), and this book has a Message, much as Something Rich and Strange had a Message.Nor does Mckillip truly expect her readers to show much intelligence in understanding the Message--it sticks up painfully all through the novel and then is announced at the end by the Faerie Queen, just in case we'd missed it.If you really love Mckillip, and you want to read everything, go ahead & read it--there are some wortwhile nuggets here and there. If you only like her, or are reading her for the first time, skip this book. Read Winter Rose instead."
5,Honors the dead,"This 1995 paperback, by David Cohen, honors the memory of 149 men and women and 19 children murdered in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 when the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was attacked.Since the 119-page book's July 1995 publication, questions have been raised as to possible connections between this devastating 1995 attack and the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Concerning those, one can consultFinal Report on the Bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah BuildingApril 19, 1995---conducted by the private Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee organized by Oklahoma State Representative Charles Key and Jayna Davis' more recent book,The Third Terrorist.The Grand Jury which indicted Timothy McVeigh, along with ""others unknown,"" including at least one subpoenaed Jordanian suspect, who had fled. The ""others"" were never found.This book is a fine memorial for the victims, and its proceeds from its sale were donated to the family of victims."
1,Save your money - all info is on the internet!,I have this book and Sander's book. Many of the designs are unusable for a wide variety of reasons. Plus you can get more info in an old issue of Speaker Builder magazine - check ebay or Audio Amateur Publications. More up-to-date and practical information can be found in audio forums. I have built ESLs and they are not that difficult or costly to build. Do a little research and add a good measure of common sense!
3,Mainly for fans of soft folky music,"For someone known mainly as a supermodel and arm candy to rock stars,Carla Bruni is actually a pretty good singer/songwriter/guitarist. The songs sound very much like lite,poppy french folk-style music. Her voice is soft and soothing,very relaxing,and her guitar work is very proficient,but does not show much range. You hear the potential,but in this album it is played safe. Overall,very good for someone with no formal training in singing,guitar,or song-writing. Good for lazy sunday afternoons even for those who do not speak or understand french. Catchiest tune is the first song. It has smooth and quick linguistic connectivity and fine guitar work."
5,Love it!,I had my husband translate the words for me since I don't speak French at all. And he ended up loving the CD just as much as I did. Carla has a beautiful raspy voice and even though I don't speak or understand French I really enjoy listening to it over and over again. Totally recommend it! Love it ... Love it... LOVE IT!
1,Carla Bruni overrated,"Oh my. How did she get a recording contract? Anemic. As comical as Tiny Tim in his day. I think it is good that she married well ...Désolé, ce chanteuse n'enchante pas !"
4,Lovely,"Carla Bruni has a unique, raspy voice and her songs are haunting and dreamy. I play this in the background while working from home and it magically makes the time fly!"
3,A little dry and boring,"This could be good for a very in tune prepared audience, but for anyone that's seeking something highly entertaining you may find yourself dissappointed. I found this to be a bit slow and dry."
5,"Excellent,","This is one of the most best songs I have ever heard, although it was a Disney song and I thought it would be more for children but it wasn't and I really enjoyed it, I hope to hear more music like it in the future."
4,C U later!,"This was a toy for my 3 yr old great nephew's birthday. He had a bendable C3PO, but it could not go to bed with him. This one is cuddly and just the right size! (His 5 month old brother likes to drool on it, too!) It's a wonderful toy for this young Star Wars fan."
2,Are you kidding?,"Seriously? When the liberal Protestant wing of Mainline churches is sputtering out, we seriously need to expand the Bible? PLEASE! People don't even read the Bible we have! This book is NOT really a companion to the Lectionary or any other orthodox Christian preaching cycle. It deliberately incorporates non-canonical texts the Church rejected as Scripture. A wasted preaching resource."
3,Good! So buy it!,"this is the sixth or seventh ""peterson"" cd I've bought and as usual i was not disappointed, although i have to say that i do prefer the 'in africa"", ""in brazil"" collections.never-the-less another cool set of tunes to kick back to on a day off or when tv is bad - which is often - or a good background party mix, etc, etc,.my personal fav's are Art Blakey - ""Alalmode"", Yusef Lateef - ""First Gymnopedie"" and of course Milt Jackson & Ray Brown with ""Enchanted Lady"""
5,Great winter socks,"I ordered a handful of different wool socks to see which ones I liked best, and these were the winners. They're comparable to wool hiking socks in terms of weight and warmth, better looking, but probably not quite as durable. They're not at all itchy. They're comfortable enough to keep on all day and night. They get too warm if I walk long distances indoors with shoes on (e.g. shopping mall). But for around the house and doing errands that have me going inside/outside in winter, they're perfect."
4,Sturdy at first glance,"Following a new fad to purchase the kind of socks that invariably can keep feet warm I bought the Wigwam Men's Merino/Silk Hiker, Charcoal, X-Large socks. Chose the X-Large for experience tells me that after the first wash, like many articles of clothing specially socks, they tend to shrink somewhat. They did, but having purchased the larger offering I ended with the right size. These socks are very warm and their built is top notch. I guess that is why they cost so much more than most other socks. I can see where they would come in very handy if the elements were at their harshest in the cold department. This is the first of this type that I personally have purchased. The last time I remember using something similar was in the good ole US Army, the very best army in the world as far as I am concerned, and I was able to keep warm there for a while in one of the most difficult areas to keep warm. 4 Stars."
5,"Warm, soft and dry","Purchased these socks because my feet tend to sweat in cold weather. If I get cold feet at work my day is shot. Based on the other good recommendations I decided to give them a try. WOW! These socks are worth 2x what they sell for easily. When your sitting in front of a computer deciding to purchase $17 dollar socks, you might be put off by the price. But when you feel comfortable all day long with warm dry feet you truly appreciate the value."
1,Good for one time...,Has it ever happened to you that you go to somebody's house and feel ashamed when you see a hole in one of your socks? Can you imagine how I felt when I saw five of my toes sticking out of the sock? And it was the second time I wore them...
5,Impressed,"These socks are truly great. They are amazingly warm and comfy, no itching at all. You can wear them around the house or outdoors, although they are perhaps too hot for near-freezing temperatures if you wear winter boots - they are designed for much colder weather. My only question mark is how long they are going to last - they don't look that great after a few washes, but it may mean little in terms of durability."
2,Go smaller or just good sleeping socks,If you have a 9.5 to 10.5 you may find these very large and they slip and slide around. I used injinji liners and never had an issue with other models but this one caused problems. I am a 9&1/2 and followed instruction for sizing on Wigwams page and REI and should have gone with the smaller size. These are getting returned!
4,Good but,"I have purchased these socks many times at different locations. They are soft, warm, and comfortable and usually come with a warranty. the price offered here is cheaper than they are usually found at retail locations."
4,very comfy,"These socks feel great. The material used, don't remember what it is, but they are soft against my tender smooth skin compared to my other wool socks that cost double the price of these."
5,Super Socks 2,"Very comfortable, hate to take them off. Made in USA makes them feel even better. Wigwam socks are now the only ones for me."
5,Worth the money,Super warm and comfortable.I wear them around the apartment with the heat turned down and am very comfortable.I highly recommend for above stated purpose.
2,Thick and coarse,These socks are well made but very coarse and ruff on the feet. They are also very thick. I would think they would be good with a silk liner for hiking.
5,Nice gift!,"I purchased these for my husband, he wears them to work and when he volunteers (fire fighter) He likes them, they're super soft and warm, providing a nice cushion between his feet and hard boots!"
3,maximum comfort; hit/miss construction,"These socks are brilliant; easily the most comfortable socks I've ever worn. I've been wearing Ingenious socks since 2001, but I switched to these merino/silk ones for this Afghanistan trip.Very warm, wick moisture away far better than the Ingenious socks, and since the liner is silk, the overzealous Fluor laundry guys can't destroy the liner with jet-blast dryer heat like they did to my Ingenious socks.The downside: despite only a few wearings/washings, several pairs developed holes in the Achilles area.Update: Of the original 15 pairs of these socks that I bought just over a year ago, I am down to a single pair. Why? all 14 other pairs developed holes in the Achilles area. Didn't matter what boots or hiking shoes I wore, within a few wearings they were torn up. The first few times, I had the socks repaired, but the patch wouldn't hold. I would really recommend Wigwam figure out some Achilles/heel reinforcement weaving technique."
5,socks,"Merino Wool/Silk socks are easily the best socks I have ever had,also the most expensive, but worth it"
5,"Excellent quality, comfort and warmth!","You won't be disappointed; this is a great product. They are comfortable, not itchy. Warm but not bulky."
5,Super warm and comfortable,"These socks fit me perfect (shoe size 12 EEE). They are the warmest, most comfortable socks I have ever owned. They have been through two wash cycles so far and are holding up like brand new. They stay in place for an entire day of walking and they are not too tight on the calves."
4,Wigwam Mens merino sock,"I have worked in cold places In the snow for hours and always cold feet even with sorrel boots and two smart would socks on each foot, so I know what cold is. These socks are supper warm for there weight, and two of them would be sufficient for supper cold. I didn't know that I was getting two pairs so I was pretty happy about that. They fell great on the feet just got them today and have been wearing them all day. They are very comfortable and I would take these of smart wool every time cause it is real wool and I can feel the difference. I would definitely recommend these to anyone and I would and probably will buy them again."
4,Great socks - the best I've ever worn!,"I'm only rating this at 4 cause the mediums are too small, there dosen't seem to be a consistent sock to shoe size chart - at least that I could find. However I still wear them and I bought 4 pairs of the large size at a latter time."
5,"I give socks for Christmas, and am loved for it","These merino/silk socks are absolutely amazing. Very soft, comfortable, decent wear-life (though not as good as darn-tough). Can't beat the feel. If you value comfort, these will serve you well. If durability is your number one deciding factor, you may want to look at darn tough socks instead. They are a step down in overall comfort, but last easily twice as long as these socks). Compared to cotton socks, these will last longer, but I buy them purely for the comfort factor."
3,Bland Rand McNally,"While this road atlas is reliable, Rand McNally continues to show a lack of innovation in its graphics and layout. Both AMC (American Map Corporation) and Michelin have more visually appealing and ultimately more helpful road atlases."
4,"super sharp, much lighter than a typical chef's knife",This knife comes very sharp. Fit and finish are nice. Feels good in the hand.This knife is very light compared to a typical chef's knife - which my wife likes and I'm not sure about. You can't rely on the heft of this knife in hard chopping. I think this will be more of a veg knife anyhow and not for butchering.I hope that super shard edge holds. If it does I'll bump this to a 5.
5,Chop-chop,"Nicely made knife, very light weight--I thought it would be heavy! Very, very sharp compared to any of my other knives.One question that should have been included is---how do you sharpen it and what do you use so you maintain the 'edge'??"
1,I too was sent the lesser knife,"I too was sent the wrong version of the knife and in my case they would not replace it with the correct Twin, so I got a refund (still to arrive-show up on my credit card bill). It was just a waste of time and a dissappointment dealing with Warehouse Deals..."
1,Knife starts to form brown spots / discolorations on one side after 8 month minimal use,"I purchased ""Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Pro S 7-Inch Santoku Knife with Hollow Edge"" in Nov 2011 via Amazon with expectation of known quality from the company. However, in less than a year and very minimal use (once a week or less since I still have my 10-year old Japanese Santoku knife), I start noticing my henckles having brown spots / discoloration on one side of the knife. This is very shocking as I was expecting a very long lasting high quality product from Zwilling. I think my less than a year, minimally used Henckels santoku knife is starting to rust!! My 10-year-old knife has newer steel than this product. The only problem I have with my old knife is the wooden handle that is falling apart. I was considering replacing my cutlery set with Henckels 12 or 15 piece set but now I'm not sure."
1,Wrong Knife Shipped,"As one reviewer states, Amazon is shipping the WRONG knife. I received my Henckels knife today and it is NOT the Twin Pro S-inch. The knife is going back."
5,Tapper,"We are actually returning this product as we have the Twin Cuisine set which is a step up from this knife. We never knew how much fun we could have working in the kitchen cooking and preparing food. We never enjoyed it before. We have had a set of these knives for two years and have thoroughly joyed them, they have made working in the kitchen an adventure and fun rather than a chore. I would recommend the J.A. Henckel knives to anyone wanting to invest in a nice knife set, but, I would recommend buying the next step up which is the Twin Cuisine."
2,Caution!,"While the product description is unclear, the first thing you need to know is that this is NOT an Apple-manufactured accessory. It's very much an off-brand item that is not made by Apple.I bought this figuring it would be a replacement for my Apple brand remote. It's most certainly not the same thing as the Apple product and you should think twice before buying. The Apple remote plugs into the dock port and then you plug the headphones into the remote. This product requires you to plug the remote into the dock port--but the headphones must be plugged into the iPod's headphone jack! That means you cannot drop the iPod into a pocket because there are wires and such sticking out of both ends. Just a terrible solution. I had no trouble getting the remote to function as it should, but the remote and headphones are visibly cheap and of inferior quality manufacture (it's hard to make plastic look this cheap). I strongly recommend you get the Apple brand remote."
4,All earbuds don't fit all ears...,"As a sound engineer for 25 years, I've tried a lot of headphones large and small and I can say that the sound of the Apple ear buds is the best in this class. The problem, is of course they don't fit everyone (me included). You can push and shove and still they fall out and/or cause pain.After several years of this, it finally dawned on me (and others, I'm sure) that you don't have to wear them in the prescribed manner. Try placing them upside down, wire pointing up, element forward and wrap the cord around the back of your ear. You may very well find that the buds will sound better, rest comfortably and won't as easily fall out."
3,NOT compatible with video ipos,"Please note that, despite the description, the remote does NOT work with all ipods with dock connector (the connector on the bottom of the ipod). The remote unit plugs into the headphone jack and adjacent connector on the top of the iPod. This adjacent connector does not appear on the top of the 5th generation video iPod.Fortunately, my husband has an iPod mini so I gave this to him. Works great with that unit. My 3-star rating reflects the incorrect product compatibility information (which also appears on the product packaging)."
3,The cord is too long. But it does what it's supposed to.,It is what it is but IMO the cord on it when attached to the iPod's headphone cord makes it dangle down near your knees. Makes it too long for average use. Could be useful when carrying it in a back pack though as it would reach into it with cord to spare. Surface of remote is mirrored like back of iPod. Buttons are easy to use and clearly marked. Should be lit however.
2,"Convenient, but design flaws","This delivers great convenience for people who carry their iPods in their bags or backpacks. However, this remote lacks durability of any kind. I have replaced this twice in a year because the cord keeps breaking. The cord does not stand any twisting at all."
2,not was it's supposed to be,"i have an ipod video, 30g, and these do not work with it. only the really old models have that extra little port near the headphone jack and without it the remote is useless. the only bonus is that i got another pair of apple headphones for about eight bucks. i bought these to use with a wired backpack and since they dont do what they say im still on the market."
2,"wires too long, connector sleeve disconnected","A short review...Don't buy this product. The wire is too long and the remote control is too heavy for the jack to hold. After a month of the remote and wire hanging and swinging about, the wire where it's connected at the jack gave out making this remote unuseable; I have to jiggle and find the sweet spot now just to make the remote work.Long wires plus a remote adds considerable stress and weight on the jack...a serious design flaw. If you want to buy this, I suggest you tie the wire and the remote using a rubber band around your IPOD to support it's weight without pulling the wire off the connector."
1,Apple Remote and ear buds,"Advertised as Apple remote and earbuds-obviously these are not-should have been suspicious due to pricing-I only know this is because I've had the Apple ones. Oh well, you get what you pay for."
2,Remote Control for the fourth's Ipod generation,"The romote control is very convenient to control the ipod. It allow to the control the ipod when the click whell is locked or not. But be carefull not to break the clip, it dosen't look solid."
4,Great Product but 45 bucks?!,"I love this remote, I can keep my ipod in my pocket while on the train and control my music, the wire is a bit long especially when coupled with the earphones but, eh, not really a big deal. Why on earth is this thing 45 bucks?! I got this with my ipod, it came in the box. Nice product but I definitely wouldn't pay 50 dollars for it. :("
2,Please invest in some quality raw materials......,"Well, the remote functions are great, they are very convenient & I have become hooked.....However that said, they really decided to spare the expense & used crappy materials to put this product together. They fall apart for no apparent reason. I am now on my 3rd remote & it has barely been a year....& why can't they just sell the remote by its self, now I am stuck with 3 crappy pairs of what seems to be the most uncomfortable ear buds ever made...they reaalllllly need to fix this & come out with something new...."
3,why the phones?,"I've a new mini, and I'd like a remote, that I, as others, consider an essential. But what stops me from getting a remote is that I can't seem to understand the idea of selling a remote with THE SAME included earbuds found on my ipod. Why do I have to get a new pair of the not-so-comfy-after-fifteen-minutes earbuds, when I already have one? When I already upgraded to the in-canals? (great sound, BTW) the remote would be much better if it'd came along with the apple in-canal headphones. Now we'd be talking!"
4,REMOTE GOOD DETAILS BAD,"The iPod remote is a very good thing just wish it was designed better. The cord is way long. I think it needs to be < a foot, with the standard iBuds you get about 6 foot of cord. Are you supposed to wrap it around your body several times ?I think the remote should come with no cord attached at all, just a in and out plug and various lengths of cable included. Pick whatever suits you.The clip is flimsy and pointed the wrong direction. [ Just like the power in on the iBook.] Is this a lefthanded thing ? I wish they had used one of those industrial metal badge holder clips instead.I LOVE the idea of a wired iPod remote SOMEBODY needs to make us a GOOD one. PLEASE."
3,Would work better if I had a ipod touch,"The headphones are pretty good, I did not have the problems that others have had with the earphones breaking. When I originally purchased them it was supposed to be compatible with ipod classic, but the remote only works with the touch and mini. Other than that for the price I cant complain. sound quality is great on the headphones. I cant say how the remote works because I have not used it."
3,Why pay more?,"3 stars = I love microplanes, but why pay more than I have to?When you can get the same product from the MANUFACTURER for only 25 cents more, WITH the slider attachment for no additional cost (these wine guys charge an extra $5) and FREE shipping, why buy it from The Wine Guys through Amazon?I usually go to Amazon first for the bulk of my shopping nowadays, but this is one of those cases where the third party seller doesn't help out the consumer here."
4,Save this book!,"Pat Cadigan's MINDPLAYERS is one of my favorite SF novels, & I challenge anybody to read the first couple of pages without finishing the book. Her ideas about designer personalities are fascinating (and they predate Prozac by several years!). Best of all, she writes with a voice like no other: sly, subversive, seductive."
3,"Good ideas, but not gripping","Mindplayers is well written, at times funny and full of cool ideas. Unfortunately it's also repetitious and, though short, still too long for it's story. This could have been a five-stare novella!"
4,So upfront!,"James Randi, former magician, is the great debunker and exposer or pseudoscience world wide... In ""Flim Flam"", Randi takes on all sorts of topics, from Kirllian photography to elves in the garden to water dowsing to spirit rappers. He doesn't just say ""this is likely fake"". Instead, he gives concrete reasons, proof, and photographs showing the people faking the effect. He is also very upfront. He doesn't spare people their thoughts or their reputations. You can find the information in this book other places, but nowhere else will you see it laid out in such detail to prove his case.Go Randi!!! Help educate the rest of the populace, and keep the perpetators of fraud in their place!"
4,"Randi's book a must-read, must-have, and must-implement","Flim-Flam! is must-read for anyone who has ever thought, ""There's got to be a trick to this."" Flim-Flam! is a must-have for anyone who takes themselves for a rational thinker. Flim-Flam! is also a must-implement, a call to critical thinking in an otherwise delusion-muddled world. Be prepared to be challenged and entertained."
2,Beliefs Are NOT Delusions!,"While I respect the writing style and the author(s) opinions, you cannot simply ""dismiss"" as delusions, various cultures beliefs and experience with the paranormal.I myself have used various psychic services, including a psychic who accurately told me my past - and foretold my future! (I cannot post the url, but the title is Psychic Tarot Spells and she is coming out with a book soon!)Too many cultures around the world have certain similarities in their experiences. Yes, there are some shysters out there, but trust me, if some of it were not true, we would discard these things in the same vein with outdated beliefs that the world is ""square""."
1,This man is not a skeptic,"I read this years ago and recently, after seeing the author make a fool of himself on the Larry King show, decided to read it again. The book is good for a laugh. This man is not a skeptic, he is a debunker with a personal agenda who is a member of an organization that has not once properly investigated a case with an open minded skeptical view. The book and the author, are just sad."
5,Indispensable,"This is one of the finest non-fiction books ever written. It should be on anyone's top 10 list! I would recommend this book for high school students because it will encourage them to spend more time reading. I recommend it for everyone else because it is a excellently told story about the ongoing war against psuedo-science. Mr. Randi is quite aware that some of actors he unmasks are naive - as a magician and human being he understands their pain, but nevertheless presses on in the interest of science and truth."
5,excellent reading,All of you who wonder is there something elseread this before you visit the local prophet.
2,debunking gets boring very quickly,"I started to read the book but I am unable to finish it. It is a variation on atheist pamphlets - similar to late Hitchen's or some such.If you are a believer in anything (the Almighty or Bermuda triangle), you will not 'loose your faith'following Randi's (Hitchen's) arguments.If you are not, you do not need read either of them. My case.So, let's find something more interesting to put on my Kindles."
5,Good read!,"Reviews of this book were spot on, I got exactly what I was expecting and I enjoyed everything about this book. I attempted to read the book with a skepticism about the skepticism (even though I am but I failed. James Randi's explanations and experiences are certainly convincing and the ironic/sarcastic angle he takes throughout the book are entertaining to say the least. I really recommend this book to anyone interested in the debunking of myths and frauds"
2,Randi's Writing style weak,"Somewhat disappointed by the hackneyed content of this early Randi book. His writing style fails, often, to flow smoothly and his contest is neither fresh nor particularly interesting. Of course, this is an old title and may serve a purpose as an early background source."
5,Absolute genius and integrity.,"Flim Flam is the kind of book you will be recommending to people for the rest of your life. This battering ram single-handedly manages to demolish the pretensions of all of those tree-wasting books that have managed to taint the word ""metaphysics."" Give ""metaphysics"" back to the philosophers, where it belongs. I would also recommend Randi's excellent book about Nostradamus.When you hear the mantra about Randi's ""close-mindedness,"" ask yourself why these people think that believing things without any evidence is ""open-minded."" They surely don't believe in the existence of leprechauns. Does that make them close-minded? It takes an open mind and open eyes to see."
4,A thorough (if one-sided) debunking of pseudoscience.,"James Randi's book is a fine reference for those of us who read claims of the paranormal every day in the newspaper and on the Internet. The only down side to the book is that Randi does not show the evidence and let the reader decide for themselves; he's already decided for you, and he's happy to tell you why."
2,Flim Flam...,"Like reading thruogh an informercial!Author spends too much time building a case for his information instead of just getting right to the point of his findings.Still some decent information in the later chapters, if you can read through the author sounding like a flim-flam man himself!"
2,They are just not that interesting,"Rory and Ita strike me as nice people who have worked hard; I just wish I could say they led lives that I found interesting. I admire Doyle for honoring his parents this way, but to put it bluntly, this was boring. Growing up, finding work, finding each other, a story that's been told a million times and most of the time in more interesting ways than can be found in this book. After 338 pages, Rory and Ita still remain ciphers, there's no real emotional depth on display; it's just the story of two people who led ordinary lives. That concept can often lead to a wondrous work of art, just not this time."
5,ONE OF THE BEST TELEPHONE SCENES EVER,"I fell in love with this movie while still in high school (1972) and it is one of my favorites. There are so many good scenes that it would take forever to list them. But two stand out and are the best in the film. The scene where Pookie and Jerry are going to have sex for the first time is sweet and honest and absolutely hysterical. Liza's telephone scene ranks up there with Louise Rainer's in ""The Great Ziegfeld"" and Barbra Streisand's in ""The Way We Were"". It will tug at your heart strings like no other scene in any movie in recent years. Liza should have beat out Maggie Smith for the OSCAR for this one for which she was nominated. A wonderful movie with laughs, tears, good music and incredible performances. Please bring this to DVD PLEASE!!!"
4,A Great Performance by Minnelli,"A gem of a little movie - engaging performances from Minnelli (Oscar-nominated, and rightfully so) and Wendell Burton, with sensitive direction from Alan J. Pakula. You have to find an indie or ""art house"" film today to enjoy a story that takes the time to explore characters and relationships in such unhurried fashion. Interesting soundtrack music, with perhaps a bit too much repetition of ""Come Saturday Morning"", but it's a minor impediment (It's performed by The Sandpipers - NOT The Association, as erroneously asserted by the London reviewer). Overall, highly recommended!!"
5,Awesome...,"I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and I simply fell in love with it's unique charm. This movie was just so...awesome! It's such a great story. I really hope it'll be put on DVD soon; it's been a long time since I've seen it."
4,I want my DVD,"This is an absolute classic film with an Oscar nominated performance by Liza Minnelli. The film was directed by Alan J. Pakula (who directed ""Klute,"" ""All the President's Men"" and ""Sophie's Choice"") - so where is the DVD? What's the hold up? There is so much garbage out there on DVD (and I'm talking foul smelling stuff that no one wants in their home) - so please, PLEASE, give Pookie/Liza her due."
5,FINALLY!!!!,"How long have fans been waiting for a legit DVD, let alone a Blu-Ray, of this wonderful, funny, sad, reflective and heartbreaking film! Practically jumped out of my skin when I saw this was going to be released. Wish there would have been an interview with Liza and Wendell, 40 plus years after its release, to talk about their experiences with this film. RIP Tim McIntyre, Dory Previn, Fred Karlin and Alan J Pakula. Thank you, Olive Films!"
3,Lisle 28500 strap wrench,"In space critical areas the tool is frustrating because of the flexing of the handle reduces the turning or holding range. If it was made out of aluminum, it would have more of a turning range and be worth paying more money for the better tool. If the range of movement is not a factor, it is a very good tool having a wide range of applications."
3,Good Read,This book was definitely a good read. Very entertaining. But it just wasn't my style. The characters really made this book what it is.
2,A NEW AGE LOOK AT DEATH FOR PRESCHOOLERS,"As a mother and early childhood educator, I found this book to be a bit unnerving, and am not sure of its usefulness with young children. Grandma is portrayed, after her death, as a heavenly, almost ghostly being, who visits earth, saying good-bye to family members, pets, and favorite earthly locations. The scenes of her visiting family members while they sleep, laying her hands upon them, are especially eerie. I question the appropriateness of leading young children into the realm of the hereafter, as this text begins to do. A questionable choice, at best, for talking with young children about this tender subject."
5,"rodrigo died in 1996, remedios now is living in san diego","I love this record and found out that rodrigo and remedios made many more recordings that were never released. After a lot of research, I found out that Rodrigo died in 1996 at the age of 47, and a great career in music was cut short. He was survived by his wife Remedios who now lives in San Diego, California. She has not recorded since. I would really like some musicologist to find her and try to get her to sing again. She is incredible and a real treasure. What a shame that an era is on the verge of dying out. I would be glad to help anyone interested, if I can...."
4,Looks Good,Nice looking o-rings Just what I wanted Package from Manf. could have been nicer For now I would buy this again
4,As Advertised,"Best deal I could find on a FIFA Approved ball, most FIFA Approved balls come in north of $100.I have had the ball for two years and played with it lightly. The surface is holding up well. The bladder leaks a bit but nothing serious (top off pressure once ever 2 months). The ball has a nice feel and flies true."
1,Poor Sizing,"This would be a good ball if it was sized correctly. I says it is FIFA approved, but it is too small. It is definitely not a size 5. It is closer to a size 4."
5,Great Ball,"I had a lower grade mitre ball and purchased two of these for use in the rec league a play in--great ball, and very rugged, which is usually not the case for higher grade soccer balls.Look for these and buy them if the fields you play on are not in good shape-- most other FIFA approved balls just won't hold up like these..."
1,Disappointed,Product is not as strong smelling as in store. Cologne seemed to be watered down if that is possible. Very dissatisfied with product.
5,nikita,"Coty has been around for a long time! The smell has not change, it is one of the best smelling musk out there."
2,Musk Perfume,"I don't have a problem with product itself. My issue with Amazon and how they listed it. There are two types of Coty Musk, one is an oil and one is a perfume spray. I wanted to purchase the oil version. When I clicked on the icon there were two different sizes listed, naturally I chose the larger size. When I received the item it was the spray not the oil. I was very upset that I couldn't return it. I take responsibility for not reading the fine print about the return policy. However, these items should be listed seperately as the are two very different products."
4,Smells Good,My wife enjoys this fragrance so that's why I purchased it. Really have no knowledge of what is or is not a good perfume.
2,Another poorly written diet book.,"I enjoyed the original Pritikin Principle book published in 1973 so I was looking for an updated version. This is NOT it.The author (the son of the original Pritikin author) seems to be fluffing up the book by repeating many concepts several times without adding any new information. The book stresses calories and doesn't give much space to other important dietary considerations such as sodium and caffeine.Another problem is that the author never explains how to calculate the calorie density of food. It does list calorie densities of many foods, but it omits many, many more.If you must read this book, buy it used. Better yet, buy the original 1973 book if you can find it."
5,Very useful,"I like this book a lot. It is a practical, balanced, to-the-point guide. I have been composing for a long time (14+ years) but I've only been studying it full time for 3 years now, and I found that the book really helped to clarify a lot of my thinking about pitch collections, 20th century harmonies, and 20th century compositional techniques.RE: The Prime Form debate. There are two methods for computing the prime form, the ""Forte"" and ""Rahn"" method. This book uses the ""Rahn"" method and is perfectly consistent throughout. While this is a minor issue, because it only affect 5 pitch class sets (of 200), perhaps it would be good to add a paragraph about the differences in a future revision to help beginniners avoid confusion."
4,WELL CRAFTED SONGS OF THE LATIN DIVA,LUCIA MENDEZ HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A QUATER OF A CENTURY . NOT MANY MEXICAN ARTITS OF HER GENERATION HAS BEEN AROUND AND LASTED SINGING THAT LONG . HER TALENT IS SHOWN IN THIS SMALL COMPILATION THAT SHOULD HAD BEEN A DOUBLE CD OF HER 25 YEARS IN THIS CARRER. HOW EVER THIS COMPILATION IS WORTH MUCH ANTICIPATION FOR A BETTER COLLECTION IN YEARS TO COME.
1,"Don't buy, missing outtakes","Don't buy this dvd, it is missing all the outtakes from the television show, particularly from playboy model kelly monaco"
1,WHAT WAS I THINKING WHEN I BOUGHT THIS?!!!!,"A COP [ERIK ESTRADA] GOES BLIND SHORTLY AFTER GETTING ELECTRICUTED. BUT, THROUGH HIS MIND, HE CAN SEE VISIONS OF CERTAIN THINGS FROM THE PAST AND THINGS THAT'RE ABOUT TO HAPPEN. LOW-BUDGET PIECE OF CRAP BEST SUMS UP THIS MOVIE. HAS JUST ABOUT NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO THE VIEWER'S INTEREST. EVEN THE FEW SPECIAL EFFECTS THAT'RE SEEN IN THIS MOVIE AIN'T EVEN GOOD! LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWER, I FOUND THIS AT WALGREEN'S FOR A VERY LOW PRICE. THIS IS MY ADVICE TO EVERYBODY WHO'S THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS DVD BECAUSE OF ITS LOW PRICE: IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET A GOOD MOVIE FOR A BARGAIN PRICE, YOU'VE SERIOUSLY THOUGHT WRONG!!!!"
5,This is a real gem. Very glad I have it in my slowly growing DVD collection.,"I found this one day a few yrs. ago at my near by Walgreen's. I believe both the other reviewers did too. But unlike them I am very happy I did. I just watched it again today. Erik Estrada was wonderful in this forgotten tv polit. The rest of the supporting cast were also very good. I especially enjoyed seeing Robert Vaughn, best non to us baby boomers as Agent for UNCLE Napoleon Solo. he did a good job considering he was the badie.I would have loved to have seen this polit made it to a full TV series.If you haven't seen this little treasure. I say IGNORE the others above. This is a real find and a very entertaining DVD.Buy this DVD. You will not be sorry."
1,so bad,"So I am sitting here and thought went through my head. What is the worst commersial movie I've ever seen? And I think of this movie, I don't remember what it was called. But now I've found it! And it is this one, Visions.. This is the kind of movie you just can't not finnish, it is truly awful. So if you wan't to see everything a movie should not be then you can't spend two bucks more wisely!"
4,Lampe Berger fragrance,Used the Lampe Berger fragrance for trhe first time this weekend and really like the clean smell it has. I have tried other fragraces and will be buying more Lampe Berger from now on.
4,Cool!,My son liked it! It's was used. But in great condition.I received it with in the time(according to the shipping I payed for).I give them 4 stars! I think that it's best for kids 5-9 and under.
2,They should have upped the ante on this performance,"I'm a fan of Audioslave. This DVD delivers on most of the songs played live, especially Tom Morello's unique and tasty guitar licks. Chris Cornell's vocals were awesome as usual.Hoewever, on two tracks, namely Be Yourself and Doesn't Remind Me, they did an amateurish job. Phil Commerford's back-up vocals on Doesn't Remind Me were horrible, and so was Chris' vocals as well. It was as if they were just jamming and trying to find their vocal key. I was cringing while listening to those two songs. The rest of the songs lived up to the expectations. Still a must buy"
5,I also loved this book so much that it hurts!!!,"Whatever posessed me to buy this book would have to be the cover. But best of all, I love the story. A perfect concoction of action, romance, a little magic and mystery. I just wanted to rant and rave about this book's cover, the designer and drawer are fantastic and should keep this up! Way to go editor Jane Yolen!And don't forget, if you read this book, you can't miss out on the sequel COURT DUEL, which ties up the knots and ends of Meliara's relationship with that evil yet plesant, calm, and also mysteriously unknown young man, whom just always happens to be just THERE, Vidanric, future king."
5,A MUST FOR FANTASY READERS,"The entire duet is a must read for anyone interested in fantasy. These books are well written, period! Anyone interested in character development will find themselves enthralled with the Countess Meliara, as they will find the tremendous personal growth of her in this book and the next."
5,Nearly Perfect...,"This is more of a note than a review: if you are even remotely interested in this book, please look for my review by Ruby Blossom also titled 'Nearly Perfect' under Court Duel (instead of Crown Duel), where I've written an extensive review that you will probably find helpful. Thank you!"
5,A Beautiful story about a beautiful culture,"Crown Duel is a beautifully written book. It is sensuous and utterly feminine, and delves into a culture that is mysterious and yet fascinating."
5,An absolutely fantastic read- a REAL WINNER,"I thought this book was amazing. My only disappointment was the fact that it had to end. I've highly recommended it to everyone I know. The poetic descriptions also made me want to go and get a fan to practice that ""fan language"". I really feel that this is one of the best books I've ever read."
5,"Wow, this book instantly became one of my favorites.","This is a terrific book, one of the best I have read yet. I am currently reading the second one which is just as good as the first so far.The characters in this book are so compelling, I just want to rage like Meliara when she was with Shevreath the whole time. Branaric seems to be one of the kindest brothers I've ever heard of; I wish he was one of my friends. Shevreath is enchanting, and I loved his snobby self from the start. His father was simply adorable, even though only came in for a little scene in the ending. Sheveath just seems as if he'd be the kind of person you just sit with all day and are comforted even by his presense. I can't wait to finish the second book. Keep writing Sherwood! Does he even read these reviews?"
5,A very entertaining story with strongly developed characters,"I've been a fan of Sherwood Smith for some time, and she just keeps getting better. The story of Meliara in several places really adds color and makes the book impossible to put down. It's a story full of magic, danger, romance and excitement to please even the daintiest of palates. If you read it, you'll be hard-pressed to wait for the next one in the series! Also, if you enjoyed this novel, you might try Wren's Quest, also by Sherwood Smith. It's a bit less developed, and obviously an earlier work, but just as entertaining."
5,Grade School Rivalry,"Meliara, the countess of Tlanth, is such a naive character. She refuses to admitt to defeat, and to a curious laid-back Marquis of Shevrath who seems to throw off vibes of interest. Meliara is such a cute person to read about.She has no clue towards why her enemy, the young Marquis, kidnaps her taking her around the woods on horseback for days, spending lonly dark nights with him in the woods, saving her from many other accounts of bad for no apparent reason (since he's a supposed enemy)is helping her, keeping her alive. I'm going to find out the outcome of their ""mysterious"" boy-girl relationship in the sequel, ""COURT DUEL""."
4,"Feisty female hero, yes!","I always love a spirited female hero--match her with impoverished and muleheaded mountain people, an evil ruler, and a mystery man who may or may not be on her side, and I am one happy camper. I can't wait to see how the revolution proceeds from the emphatic conclusion of *Crown Duel,* and look forward to seeing Meliara as she matures as a person and as a leader!"
4,Crown Duel,"Crown Duel was an excellent book. It was so exciting. After the death of their father, teenage Countess Meliara Astair and her brother must forfill their promise to him and remove King Galdran from the throne of Remalna. They revolt against the king and start a war. Meliara is captures and eludes the knig and his soldiers several times. Not only must she escape the soldiers, but also death at the hands of the evil king."
5,"Crown Duel: The Crown & Court Duet, Book I",A young Countess Melaria and her brother set out to do this impossible and take on the king without help to save a covenant created hundereds of years ago. This book has plenty of secrects and laughs. Smith has just enough details to give you a clear image of the world and its people but still leaves out enough to let you fill in things the way you want to. By the end of the book you'll be begging for more.
5,Love that book!,"Meliara is the perfect heroine: sensable, stubborn yet sensitive, and highly appealing. The Marquise is my favorite charecter. He seems very romantic and mysterious. I love the part when they were in the woods. It made me hot! If you don't have the book, go out and buy it!"
5,RUSTIC FANTASY TALE WITH A SPIN OFF,"The author did an excellent job in giving detail into the history of Remalna and its characters, it made me want to read more about it. I plan to read the rest of her books that go with this book. The way she writes them it makes them sound so real like they were a part of our history.--James N.--"
5,Great book,"Meliara seems like such a real character. She never does everything perfectly, but messes things up, like most of us would in her situation. All the characters were great, and the plot was exciting. I can't wait to read the sequel. Sherwood Smith knows exactly what I like to read, this book almost might have been written for me. If you even remotely like fantasy, give this book a try--200+ reviewers can't be wrong!"
5,The Absolute COOLEST book!!!,"I was with my friend at the library and we saw this book. I LOve fantasy so naturaly I read it.... I automaticly fell in love with this book, I couldn't put it down!! So far I've read it 3 times. I also read the next in the series and it is just as good!!"
5,The most heart touching book ever,This book must be placed on a par with Robin Mckinley's books. The book is touching as it causes you to understand the hardships both characters faced. Smith has create a story that will be remembered. I forsee Sherwood Smith becoming one of the major voices of fantasy in a few years.
2,I Hated This Girl,"Boy, did I hate this girl. The whole middle half of the book is about what an immature, whiny, thoughless, coarse child she is. There's a whole section of her fleeing where she CONTINUALLY gives up her location just to attempt to make a lame ""gesture"" against her pursuers. Towards the end of the pursuit, I was hoping she'd 'try to stick it to the Man' again and finally impale herself on a sword accidentally and DIE! She's like a textbook for doing everything *WRONG*.She also wallows in her educational ignorance and her desire not to grow up and take real responsibility.It's not until the epilogue that I have any good opinion of her and I'm getting the sequel solely to find out how things go for Shevraeth and Bran. Maybe, if things progress as they started in the Epilogue, I'll stop wishing she'd die a horrible death."
3,"Engaging, but mostly one long chase scene","This is a well written book, but the magic used in the story adds nothing essential to the story and the plot is mostly an extended chase. It was an interesting read, but it pales in comparison to Lloyd Alexander's books, or Philip Pullman's."
2,If you're really board.......,"This book was alright, it had a pretty cool story, but she spent all of the book bumbling around half dead, or stealing meat pies. This story line is really good but I don't think the author really pulled it out to its full potential. The heroine messed up so many times, it was a real drag. I felt like instead of a hero we had this insane flake. Well it isn't bad if you're super board, but wait till it comes out on paperback so it's cheaper."
5,WELL CRAFTED TALE,"There can be few greater pleasures in the world than reading Sherwood Smith for the first time. The Tlanth Castle, the Renaleus Court, the Hills, the ballroom - within the confines of these what a universe of emotions, of meaningful gestures and movements she creates. As well as being a master of language, here Sherwood Smith displays her mastery of the art of the novel; she teases the reader along one path, only to startle him in the end with an another. This novel confirms view I have long held : There may be novelists greater than Smith, but none so perfect to create such a touching fantasy."
5,A fine start to a GREAT series,"Crown Duelis one of my favorite books ever. Although the writing is polished to shine like a glinting sword. The book drew me into the world of Remalan, which I believe was somewhere mentioned in the Wren books, am I right?.When I read this book I was exactly Meliara' age (about 17?) and felt an incredibly strong empathy (no pun intended) with Melaira. The world is rich and detailed. If you've ever dreamed of escaping your life and doing something exciting, this is the book for you!"
5,A VERY well written book,"For anyone that might be reading this right now, I'm telling you to read ""Crown Duel"". It's a story about a young woman struggling with happiness, sorrow, and love in her life."
5,A royal teenager weaves together her emotions and thoughts,"This was one of the most cleverly constructed books I have ever read. Deep, hungry emotions and confusing, new thoughts. An array of everything in need for a coming of age fiction of a teenage girl of royalty."
2,not worth it,"The item took a long time to arrive, and when it did I was very disappointed with it. It cost a lot of money and the content was pretty much what you read in the books. The few pictures of the characters in the book are good, but not worth the price. I can see now why there are no preview pages for this book!"
2,Would not touch this one with a barge pole,"Sound from this unit is fair...nothing to call home about. In the Washington, DC where the station frequencies are quite crowded, tuning in to my favorite stations is impossible. My boss has an older Philips unit that tunes in with no problem. The units are separated by about 20 feet and are both sitting in windows on the same same side of the building. If you intend to use the radio, forget this unit."
5,Good Read,"Ordered this on the advice of a friend. Good blurbs, great cover. The story did not disappoint. Ron Shade's a believable hero. A man's man. He solves the death of the illegal with good pacing and plenty of action. Never a dull moment. Enjoyed the kickboxing. Interesting characters. I'll pick up the next Ron Shade when it comes out. Good writing. I recommend it."
3,Where credit is due.,"Aliens Labyrinth is an outstanding tale , probably the best spin off novelization from the original movie bloodline. I don't want to give the plot away too much but as the name suggests there is a labyrinth ...the story itself, the scenarios tightly weaved , the sharp twists and turns and surprise ending . I personally found that much of the 'horror ' of the story disturbed me immensley , It captures the original desperate spirit of the original movie and expands upon it ,leaving your skin cold and blood chilled. Here is an important detail ... I'd like to commend JIM WOODRING for writing this truely outstanding story , when you buy this novel you may note in the small print a mention of his name , alternatively you could look out for the original graphic novel version of this book , beautifully illustrated by Kilian Plunkett and proper credit given to the storys true author ."
5,Horrifying...And A Very Good Read,"This is a truly creepy novel. The way the Aliens are portrayed is astounding. I am a huge Alien fan and I must say, this book impressed me. The ending where Crespi and Sharon McGuinness were in the maze with the Alien drones running around was awesome. And Paul Church is truly a freaky character. If you're into the Alien movies, comics etc. this would be a great book. I especially like Crespi and Churches flashback scenes to their previous encounters with the Alien. This is a definite must read."
2,Schlock falls off,"Previous reviewer makes an excellent point: the aliens have got boring because they are nothing but schlock machines, the plots nothing but grunge-generation. Once shock and disgust wears off, nothing is really left. By contrast, Larry Niven's ""The Man-Kzin Wars"" have aliens - intelligent tiger-like creatures, who have a taste for human flesh but are much more than grunge-generators. They can actually interact with humans, think, and have complex characters of their own. The result is something a good deal more lastingly interesting. A Man-Kzin story, with Kzin characters like Scarface, Chuut-Riit, Traat-Admiral, the Vaughn Tiger and the Gutting Claw's Telepath, is a story you can go back to (also the science is better and the humans are a lot more interesting, too). Nobody wants to read an ""Aliens"" more than once unless they are a really dumb sicko."
2,I wanted so much for this to be good.,"Lionel Hampton & the Golden Men of Jazz live at the Blue Note is one of my favorite jazz CD's. I really was hoping this DVD would be of the same quality. Unfortunately the mixing is really bad. Sometimes all you can hear is cymbal. Clark Terry's flugal sounds muted all the time like it has a rag in it. The overall mix is terrible -- you can barely hear the horns when they are playing together. When a soloist begins, it takes a while before they turn up the microphone. Definitely not of the quality of some of my other favorite DVD's --- Diana Krall live in Paris or Count Basie & Diane Shure. Get those first!"
3,A lyrical film-ballet,"This is one of the only two videos which record Mr. Vasiliev's choreaographic talent - the other one being ""Macbeth"".Anyuta is in a more lyrical vein. The title role is danced by Ekaterina Maximova, who happens to be Mr. Vasiliev's wife. The story is rather sad and very Russian, being based on a short story by Tchekov.It was recorded in a studio and not on a theater stage. Mr. Vassiliev himself plays the role of Anyuta's father, and does some character dancing in the ballet. The language is that of traditional ballet and the style is gently realistic.A film with rather subdued emotions but still charming and worth having."
5,Consider yourself lucky,"If you manage to get your hands on one of the early prints of this consider yourself lucky. This is a dark, moody, hypnotic, and very compelling disc of music. I have no doubt some film director somewhere will hear this and want it embedded into their film. This is because, musically, it creates such a powerful feeling. This is the kind of music that makes you emotional and introspective. Killer natural drum riffs kick in as well as startling vocal parts. This is still underground and mostly undiscovered. H.U.B.E. is a special piece of work, and I look forward to future works."
3,These are great,"very sharp and great for electrical work, the only down side is that they are a little pricey, but still worth it"
4,"Good, but not invincible","I bought these for the kids to use, because they are billed as being very tough. I prefer plastic for the kids, but my wife read an article that made her think that plastic cups will turn the kids into aliens. So now we need glass cups...We have had about 3 drops. 2 of the drops did not break the glass, but one drop shattered a glass. These are good, but don't expect to play catch with them!"
2,Glasses Arrived Grimy,"I love Duralex glassware & have ordered Duralex via Amazon.com before.That is why I am shocked, by what I discovered upon opening the box.Three of the 6 glasses I ordered arrived dirty/grimy. 2 had an oily residue on the outside of the glass (as though they wear handled by lotioned hands) and one had spots on the inside (as though it had been washed in a dishwasher).Since I ordered them for a party and did not have the time to return them, I ran them through the dishwasher with vinegar a few times to remove the grime.Ick Amazon!Where is your product control?Disappointed"
5,very nice..classic..durable,these look like you would find in a nice cafe...seem very hardy...my friends have a habit of breaking my glasses..these have held up well
5,perfect picnic glasses,"These are the perfect glasses to pack into your picnic basket. They nest, don't break, feel good in your hand, and are so much nicer to drink wine from than plastic. We have used them for years. We entertain outdoors frequently and I am finding I need more. In fact, I'm ordering extra, just in case they go out of production, again."
2,Not perfect,"I owned these glasses for many years. They LOVE to chip around the rim. This leaves sharp edges! The solution is to use emery paper and sand them smooth. They no longer look perfect but they are useable again.The original shape for the bigger glass was MUCH more graceful and nicer to hold. The ""juice"" size glass are short enough you will want to stack them, but do not. This seems to contribute greatly to the rim chipping problem.This is a product that is NOT like the original ones 30+ years ago. Very sad."
1,Not as durable as I expected,I bought a set of 16 7/8 oz. tumblers and was pleased until one audibly popped and literally exploded in my hand into glass cubes all over my kitchen and dishwasher.Luckily the cubes weren't sharp and cleaned up easily with a vacuum.Some Google'ing indicated that this failure could be due to NiS impurities and inclusions in the glass. [...]Seems like there are some quality control issues with this otherwise decent product.
5,Good stuff,"Bought these as a gift for my son, who needed a new set of glasses and is also very interested in products from other cultures. These are made in France, and apparently are in common daily use there. He loved them. Be aware that although they hold a full cup's worth of liquid, they are quite short. They are also probably too big around for little kids to hold easily. But they're heavy, sturdy, and attractive. Recommended."
5,Best glass I have used,"The Duralex Picardie tumblers are the best set of glassed we have ever had. They clean well, fit in the dishwasher nicely, they are tough and resistant to breakage, attractive, and fit your hand and mouth well. I would recommend them highly."
4,Nice glasses but seem smaller than described,Very nice glasses. Very sturdy as well. They are a bit smaller than I wanted them to be so i purchased a 16oz set of Rocco's. those were just right. These are nice too so now I have different sizes for different ocasions. Over all I am satisfied.
5,small glasses stack nicely,"These glasses are the right size for a 4 once portion of juice in the morning. They also stack quite well, appear rugged and have the attractive appearance of French drinking glasses."
5,Seriously Unbreakable,"My very intoxicated significant other tossed one of these down on concrete. It survived. I love these glasses. The 7.75 ounce glasses are a great size for water, and they look great. They are pretty contemporary, so they match our Mikasa French Countryside plates pretty well. Great find!"
1,Defects in glass - bubbles & Big Chip,"I received and unpacked the glasses; Washed them and filled one with ice water. And, . . . then I noticed that there were little bubbles in the glass. I expected the rest and four out of the six glasses had these bubbles. I would expect that type of defect from a less expensive product--but not when you pay around $5 a glass. I bought the small 4.5 ounce glasses and there were no problems with those. Boy!! what a disappointment!!It is one day later, I placed the glass in a soapy dishwater with 2 plastic bowls and 1 glass and it comes out chipped. So instead of finding that they are tough and can handle day-to-day use, I find that they are EXCEEDINGLY fragile. I bought these high-priced glasses just to prevent that type of thing. BUYER BEWARE--unless you have money to throw away."
5,Fabulous Glasses,"These glasses are fantastic: durable, functional, and attractive. I came across Duralex when I was looking to replace our take and toss cups with something more grown up for my almost 3 year old. He learned to drink out of an open cup many months ago, but he was still using the take and toss cups (just without the sippy top). I felt like it was time to transition to something a tad more grown up - these glasses are the perfect size to fit in his hands and he definitely feels like a big boy using them. He chucked one into the sink the other day and nothing happened to it so I can also speak to the durability. If you are looking for the next step up for a cup for your toddler, this is the right glass for you. Side note: I have been drinking wine from them as well!"
5,Perfect glasses,"Everything the other users have written is true. I'd like to add that the bottoms of these glasses are perfectly flat, so that after going through the dishwasher there's no need to empty a concave bottom that's collected water, nor do I have to dry the bottoms. This may seem unimportant, but to me it makes these glasses perfect."
4,"Two issues, both ultimately resolved....","Bought 30 of them in various sizes...I was tired of mix-n-match glasses in the kitchen cabinet. I will say they are strong, we have granite counters, wood floors, a deep sink and 2 kids who feel its ok to drop things or not pay attention when they put something in the sink with a ""thud"". Nice sizes, fit great in your hand, solid, but not heavy. I had two problems, one caused the rating to 4 stars.1. One of the sets came through UPS with 3 shattered glasses in small pieces in the box. Called Amazon, new set sent, no problem really, just the packaging was less than stellar.2. The glasses smelled of sulfur (from manufacturing I think) even after hand washing, then machine washing 2-3 times, but finally its gone. Odd, and awful for the time it was there.Overall, satisfied, but man...try drinking your iced tea with a sulfur odor sometime...wow."
1,You Can Find Better Information on The Boards,"The entire book (which is so poorly bound it fell apart after one reading) is full of paranoid theorizing that I just could not even understand why the author bothered. ....The book like 2001 is a huge disappointment. Sad but true. Remember, you can't go wrong if you Gorightly!"
1,HUGE WASTE OF TREES!,"I waited and waited for this self-published book to come out. I went to the website, I read sample chapters - and what I got was a re-puke of every other book on the FAMILY. No new interviews, no new news, and the only observations were [...] paranoia! Why anyone would buy this is beyond me, except for the clarity factor since the books it rips off are unclear, with THE FAMILY by Sanders being deranged and HELTER SKELTER by the Bug being fiction. No photos, no index, just weirdness and illogic. Might be good to hit unwanted salespeople with."
1,Just a note...,"I haven't read this book, yet, but I can already see that many people have not made the connection between the CIA and cults. ALL intelligence agencies use cults and 'religions' as cover, as an espionage device, and as weapons. They use magical belief systems because a true believer is easy to manipulate. They also employee magicians for various reasons, but one use was to teach the production of 'miracles', e.g. Jim Jones, to convince followers of a leader's powers, and modern technology is making that task easier. The Manson debacle was just one of the finales for the CIA's 'OPERATION CHAOS', their very successful attempt to subvert the radical left-wing youth movement, and what they perceived to be the unseen hand of a foreign power.If you really want to blow your mind, Google: 'The Seven Degrees of Charles Milles Manson', and you'll see the effects of this branch of OPERATION CHAOS.I cannot wait to get my hands on this one!"
4,Comprehensive and up to date,"This is an excellent and up to date account of the Manson Family's activities both pre and post Hinman/Tate/LaBianca/Shea. Gorightly sifts through many of the theories and allows the readers to come to their own conclusion. Although Gorightly includes even the most outlandish thoeories, like those presented by Maury Terry, he doesn't commit to any and the reader is able to form an objective conclusion. Readers of Manson lore will love this book as will true crime buffs and conspiracy theorists."
3,one extra star for the cover!,"The slangy informal prose makes Gorightly a disarming guide through this compendium of wacky Manson lore. There's a little of that underground-UFO-... stance ('what the mainstream press won't tell you!') but the author doesn't take it too seriously so don't you either. There are no notes or sources to speak of, so it may not correspond to what many of us think as a ""real"" book, but it's somewhat entertaining if taken in the right spirit. The breathless tone at times reminds one of a young Geraldo Rivera - loony but strangely compelling."
1,Proof Reader Challenged,"As conspiracy books go, it's no better or worse. Parts were interesting; parts were mind numbingly dull. What proved to be a major distraction for me was the extremely high number of copy errors. It's hard to take content seriously when the word ""altar"" was spelled ""alter"" throughout the whole tome. Made me wonder how seriously I could take it with such a sloppy presentation. Or maybe the mistakes were some sort of advanced conspiracy code lingo."
4,Great Detailed History,This is an excellent book - well researched and filled with fascinating stories. If you are looking for a pop book filled with spooky shipwreck stories this is not for you. If you are serious about the subject and wish a detailed and in depth history of Chesapeake shipwrecks and can handle an actual history book - this is the one for you. There is a lack of artwork/photographs. The writing is well done though by the nature of the subject it is a bit jumpy from subject to subject. A wonderful effort - well worth the price !
4,"Shipwrecks on the Chesapeake: Maritime Disasters on Chesapeake Bay and Its Tributaries, 1608-1978","Well written and solid research goes into this book. All in all a useful book for the library, to go with the rest of Donald Shomette's work."
2,Pedestrian,This is more about ships being scuttled during wars than anything else. Good book to read when you're trying to get to sleep! Not much in the way of pictures.
2,Stick On Forever,This mount sticks well for a couple of days and has good adjustment angle range. It clips on and off the C Series GPS easily and securly BUT it would not come off my car windscreen after I left it on for about 3 weeks. I had to tear the rubber leaving part of the suction cup stuck to my windshield. Maybe you could pre-coat the suction cup with some kind of releasing grease or something? Don't leave it on!
2,Permanent NOT Temporary,Leave it on your windshield for more than two weeks and the only way to take it off is to tear the rubber. Mine does not work at all now. I'm ordering the dash mount.
2,a pain in the neck,"This is the suction mount that came with my C330 and it probably is too good at sticking on the windshield.I had it on my windshield for a month, then I tried taking it off and I just couldn't for the life of me! I ended up ripping apart the rubber and now have a nice imprint on my windshield, and of course the mount no longer sticks as good as it did before.If you're planning on putting this mount on one place for the rest of its life then this mount is great. Otherwise remember to take it off from time to time.I am ordering the dash mount now."
1,Better off with the dash mount,"as your reading these... please pay close attention to all the people who are telling you to NOT keep the suction cup mount on at all times.... I live in Tx & yes, it's hot... I only left it on for the weekend when we went out of town... BIG mistake... I now have an icky black plastic circle stuck on the windsghield... I didn't think it would happen so fast but tht rubber melts quick... the GPS ROCKS but they need to come up with a better mount... I think I'll be buying the dash one instead.. it's cheaper & looks to be the better option"
3,Garmin Street Pilot Parts,"All that I needed was a replacement 12-volt adapter, but I was forced to buy a suction mount as well.Given the distorted prices of such items, it's unethical to force me to buy two parts when I only need one!!!"
2,Not as good as it should be!,"Even though I live in a very hot area, I have not had trouble with the rubber melting. I have had trouble with the swivel losing its ability to tighten, allowing the unit to twist.Biggest problem has been that the suction cup will not stick unless wetted, and then will lose suction within a couple of days...maybe that's why I haven't had the stuck rubber issue!Perhaps my windshield is curved more than this unit likes...have used another GPS with a different mount that has no trouble holding suction."
2,Better than nothing,"Good thing it came free with my StreetPilot because it's sure not worth much. It's bulky and inconvenient because the cord hands down over the dash in the way and it blocks your view when it is attached to the windshield. It's better than nothing, but not by much."
1,doesn't work on Subaru,"Hi,This product doesn't work on a Subaru legacy. I couldn't get the garmin to stick to the mat or the mat to stick to the dashboard. I wouldn't bother buying this."
4,Does what I need,"The original mount I had for my c340 was broken in a car accident almost two years ago. I had been looking in stores and couldn't find it, so when a new job offer came in an unfamiliar city, I finally really needed a new one. This one is especially hard to find and replace because with the c340, the power cord attaches through the mount, not the unit itself. This product did what I needed it to do."
3,Sticky issues,"I left this unit in the car for a few days, but unlike most of the reviews here, I had the opposite reaction. In the summer heat, the arm fell off, and now, it wont stay on. I was driving to Boston from NY this weekend, and it stayed on most of the ride, but as soon as I got off the exit, and needed it to navigate me through the streets, it falls. The dash seems like a better idea.Before the heat issue, the mount was terrific. I loved the angles and it was easy to readjust, so you could place it just right. If you are going to go with this unit, take it off if you are not in the car with it."
5,Garmin C330 mount,"Product works great. I removed the power cord from my original mount to adapt it to the mount that I have for my motorcycle. The contacts on the power cord are fragile and I did not want to transfer the power cord from the car mount to the motorcycle mount every time I needed it in fear that I would damage the cord. I originally set out trying to find just a replacememnt cord to put back on my car mount. When I saw this replacement mount with a new cord, I bought it. The mount clipped right on to my GPS and the way the power cord plugs into the mount is better that than what I originally got from the factory."
5,Exactly as advertised.,I received my order when expected and it worked exactly as expected. I will certainly order more from Amazon.
2,Creativity Sucking Vampire,"For anyone who has heard Fergie's single, London Bridge...you may be interested in knowing that she ""emulates"" the style of an underground hip hoptress M.I.A. -who hails from London coincidentally. Is this style snatching the highest form of flattery? When I heard London Bridge it made me sick...At any rate, I highly recommend that you give credit to where credit is due and give M.I.A. a listen. You may have heard her song, Galang...but the rest of her cd is worthy of your attention as well."
3,promiscuous,"God! This girl sings about sex all the time. My humps, london bridge obviously referring to ""V"" between the legs, and fergalicious singing about how tasty she is. God Fergie you're almost in your 30's now. And yes i do remember Fergie back in the late 1990's girl group Wild Orchid which the gay audience are most familiar with. Even Madonna never ever wrote such classless cheap sex songs. Madonna's songs were more of the sexual erotic side. Fergie sounds like a Ho. She should put out songs that have more class."
2,For me it wasn't that good.,"I remember when this album came out, Fergie was practically the biggest pop star for a while. I never was a huge of the black eyed peas. The overplay their crap way too much. So when Fergie came out as a solo act,and I wasn't execpting her to be huge. Boy was I wrong. There were several hit singles, and Fergie seemed like she was everywhere(as far as music goes...). I mean let's face it,she can sing, She's hot, and she had good producers for this album. I thought Fergilicous was awful! London Brdige wasn't too bad, but got really old after a while. Clumsy had to be my favorite track because it has great beats, and her voice doesn't annoy me. Big Girls Don't Cry seemed as if it were missing something. Like it needed an extra kick to it, if it did then it would have been as good as Irreplaceble by Beyonce for me. The beginning of Glamourous was funny,but the song sucked. Overall, if you like hiphop pop then you should buy this cd, if not then dont waste your money or time!"
3,Fergie,"Fergie is very talented and while the songs that a hit are great the ones that are not leave a lot to be desired. She has so much more potential than what she is doing. These hip hop getto songs are limiting her talent, she needs to break away from that style and realy show us what she's got!"
4,Didn't know the girl could sing!!!,"I got my copy of the Cd this past Friday, and I have been playing it for the past 3days. There are a number of songs that I like such as Fergalicious, All that I got, Clumsy, Glamorous, Here I come and the best song on the CD Big Girls don't Cry. Fergie is best suited to be a singer IMO than a rapper. I think with the right producers and song writer Fergie could blow up. The next Tina Marie??"
2,"She's got the bass, well sorta.","This is great cd if your music taste is lacking. Ok some of the songs get stuck in your head, I am not saying that's a good thing but to me the only song from The Dutchess that has depth is Big Girls Don't Cry. Fergie is one of those artist you just don't take seriously, her songs drip with silliness like Fergalicious and Glamourous. She does have a decent voice but the songwriting is messy and seems awkward on many verses. Songs like Finally, Here I Come, and London Bridge are fun to listen to but this album isn't gonna be a legendary album in the next 20 or even 10 years. Fergie is nice to look at but her music won't hold up, but hell anything is better than that Black Eyed Peas, easily one of the worst groups ever! If Fergie wants a long career, she will have to compose better songs than this."
1,Moans,"A little Fergis goes a long way. While I enjoy her vocals with the BEP, this solo album is terrible. ""London Bridge"" was beyond ridiculous with its bizarre sexual innuendos and annoying chorus. Time to step back into the group situation, Fergs."
1,Huh?,"I was looking forward to years for Fergie to release a solo album. I think her voice is classy and very talented. However, it appears that she doesn't think so... she thinks she needs to entertain 13 year olds not 30. I am very upset with the unintelligent songs on here. I feel Paris Hilton's album has more validity then this one... yea, ouch. I guess I waited for nothing."
4,i love this album but...,"never thought i would say this but i wish i had gotten the ""dirty version""insteadsome of the songs dont sound rightespecially glamoroustake your broke broke home instead of broke a++ homeit did sound wrongi normally dont mind clean versionsthis time i didi may get the dirty version just to hear it in its original contextoverall its a great cd"
5,Fergie,"Fergie is definitely a talented singer-songwriter. This collection is spicy and diverse. Very catchy melodies and lyrics. ""Finally"" is probably my favorite cut on the cd...such an awesome song that really showcases just how talented Fergie is. Love her voice and her attitude. I wish the profanity was not there...but that probably dates me. I hold very conservative views and bias'. But still listen to the cd every day."
5,"In only 9 months, Stacey 'Fergie' Ferguson has made her own mark in Rock History with ""The Dutchess""","Back in the late Summer, 2006, Fergie released her first solo album, ""The Dutchess"" and the first single, ""London Bridge"" hit the charts and helped her announce to the world, ""look out y'all, here comes Fergie!"" Then, later in October '06, ""The Dutchess"" continued with its second single, ""Fergalicious"" which also took radios across the country by storm when it hit the charts. By this time, Fergie was larger than life. Then, ""Glamorous"" came out in Early '07. Now, she had already climbed the skyscraper to stardom, and fans were ready for more. Then, not to long after, she released the calmber, slower yet chart-climbing hit, ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" which helped her to continue as a part of Rock history. If Fergie keeps this up, she will make herself a major part of rock history in 30 years, and still be here doing it."
3,Good singles but lots of filler,"I wasn't really a Black Eyed Peas fan so I was surprised I enjoyed Fergie's singles so much. From the hardcore ""London Bridge"" to the 80's rap feel of ""Fergaliscious"" to the self-descriptive ""Glamerous"" her singles are just amazing. I also love the single ""Big Girls Don't Cry."" I wasn't however a fan of the album besides the singles. There is a lot of filler and you can tell this album was rushed for the market. Thanks to youtube (where you can listen to the songs for free!) I was able to listen to this album without buying it and I am dissapointed with Fergie. Hopefully next time she'll release a good album with good songs besides the radio singles. If you're a fan of Fergie from listening to her on the radio then I wouldn't reccomend this album. Sorry but I think I'll pass."
4,Love her voice and style,"The music is really a good mixture of different sounds and rhythms. First girl singer to ""break"" away from her group and still sound good, unlike Gwen (wish she stuck with No Doubt)"
1,Honestly...,...I think death by stoning would be too good for Fergie. And the Black Eyed Peas have set Hip Hop back by about a million years. Still i hope all of the good artists who they cannibalize mercilessly for samples are getting paid from this garbage.
5,Fergielicious!!!!,"The sounds are mostly upbeat and even the smooth cuts make you want to sing and groove. Very nice for driving, cleaning or just chillin."
2,Meh.,"I got this because I loved all the songs she released off it. Unfortunately, those were the only good songs on the album. It was a great disappointment. Sometimes it the beat that's disappointing other times its the ridiculous lyrics. I don't recommend the whole album. Just get the songs you know you like."
1,"Not! Fergalicious, a disappointing start for Fergie","Fergie has great pipes, it is a shame they were wasted on this album. I'm not a prude by any means but the gratuitous cursing throughout ""London Bridge"" gets tedious. She tries to make everyone happy by hitting every musical genre but ends up satisfying no one. I expected better.Advice: Don't waste your money...buy the singles!"
5,enjoying this cd,while this is a chick album...chris long has this downloaded into his ipod...when i was listening to his ipod..i came across this song finally...had to buy the cd myself..
2,Reminds me of the way I feel about Lindsay Lohan.,"I like certain songs of hers. Like Fergalicious, Voodoo Doll, Here I Come, Big Girls Dont Cry, Mary Jane Shoes, and Losing My Ground. I skip over Clumsy, All That I Got, London Bridge, Pedestal, Glamorous, Velvet, and Finally. I really don't like Fergie... or Lindsay for that matter... But I do like *some* of the songs they ""sing"".Wait for this item to go on clearance..."
3,It's not THAT bad,"One thing I will say on a positive note is that her vocals REALLY surprised me. She has a much better voice than she seems to have when she was singing with the Black Eye Peas. However, some of the lyrics are just ridiculous and I can understand why serious music fans would hate it. The positive things about this album is that it is fun to listen to and after a little bit of listening, they become kind of catchy. But that's about as far as it goes. Definitely not Hall Of Fame worthy, but it exceeded my expectations."
4,Just not sure,"Interesting album not 100% sure I like it. She seems to be trying to be something that she is not. Though for a pop album it is more then I expected. I am eager to see what she is doing in 3 years. Vocally she is great, and she worked with some amazing producers, all that is left is the lyric."
5,a great mix,"I have loved Fergie thru the last two BEP albums and was thrilled when she release a solo album. The great mix of songs on this album makes me want to go dancing. I love the beat to all the songs and the lyrics are catchy. I listened to the CD serveral times already and look forward to many hours of listening pleasure in the future. Her song Clumsy is by far the best song I have heard in a long time. It has made my list of all time favorite songs already, ranking up there with: hot in herre, you're still the one, everything I do (I do for you), and Sweet home alabama. at least that is my opinion."
3,Not bad,Not a bad CD for fergie. Some good songs but overall an okay listen. Many of the beats are similar with only slight variations causing the listener to get bored with it easily.
5,Pleasantly Surprised....AND LOVING IT,"I will be the first to admit that I do not like the ""new"" Black Eyed Peas. I loved their old sound...less pop, more conscious rap. And I equated my dislike with Fergie...the new girl. So with that said, I wasn't expecting much from her CD. However, I forgot that not too long ago, Fergie was in a group that I absolutely loved...Wild Orchid, and those girls could SING. So I decided to give Fergie a chance, since I was stung my the ""London Bridge"" bug, and lo and behold, I absolutely love her CD. I love absolutely ever song. Each song has its own personal flavor, and I like that. My personal faves are: Clumsy, All That I Got (I love the song that it's sampled from), Voodoo Doll, and Mary Jane Shoes, I also like the Bonus Track: Wake Up. And actually at times Fergie sounds like other artist that I like, mainly...Natasha Bedingfield and Res (check her out!!!). All in all, this Dutchess is reigning supreme!!!!"
5,Love it!,"I love this CD! this is one of my favorite CDs and it's one I don't 'have to' be in the mood for, I can listen to it anytime."
3,are they forcing us into the digital revolution????,"So I have always been a big supporter of buying actual cd's. Even when you download something on iTunes you are asked to ""back-up"" your purchases.. i.e. burn a physical cd of your downloaded music. This Fergie re-release is simply pissing me off... which I would guess is not her fault, but the record labels. This re-release includes 4 new songs. I bought this CD today only to find out that over on iTunes, there is a 5 track digital download EP. Yes, you read that right.. 5 tracks. There is a song called ""Pick It Up"", which you can only get on the digital down EP. So, if you already have this Fergie CD from 2006, go download the EP that is available. And as a matter of fact.. FYI.. you can ONLY get the additional song ""Pick It Up"" if you download the ENTIRE EP... it is not available as a single song download."
4,Very Good,"I must say that the great thing about Fergie, is she can actually sing. She does showcase that talent on several songs here. While im not a big fan of raping songs much anymore, those are good as well. You really need to listen to this cd a couple times to enjoy, ill admit i downloaded it once and was like ugh. But then i relistened to each song and found myself truly liking the cd. Its just like any cd really you have to listen to a few times to really get the feel of the artist. I like her singing in Wild Orchid so i guess i really like the songs more where she actually sings. I was never really a big fan of London Bridge, but i suppose i see why she released it."
2,A little disappointing....,"Perhaps I was expecting too much, but after listening through this CD a couple times I was a little disppointed. It gets monotonous and repetitive, but the beats sure are catchy. Not terrible - but Just Ok."
2,so so,"Bottom Line, the girl can sing! I don't know what point she is trying to get across in all the other stuff that she is rapping and yelling about but I think if she would do more singing instead of yelling, the cd would be 5 stars. the make up song proves that she has a voice. I absolutely hate that she gets more credit for ""london bridge""! It just goes to show what kind of listeners we have in this day and age."
1,Disappointed,"Never receive it, and haven't receive a refund yet.It was intended for a x-mas gift, :-(."
4,"Great CD, don't agree with price difference!","Great CD!! I purchased the clean version because my daughters enjoy Fergies music but I don't want all the bad language. However, I don't agree that it cost 2 dollars more just for the clean version!"
4,Spelling anyone?,"T to the A to the S-T-E-Y girl you tastey... D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S... Then she teaches G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S... Gotta love getting your spelling lessons in while listening to this CD. :)"
3,Not as good as i thought it would be,I guess I was expecting something more along the lines of Black Eyed Peas but there are a couple songs that are okay and more with hip hop but the other songs are garbage.
3,Average.,"The only tracks that I enjoyed were the ballad Finally and Glamorous.She needs to be more decent,London Bridge and Fergalicious are both talking about how ""hot"" she is. And you'd think comparing herself to a ho is being cool? No,definitely no.I want her back with BEP. She's terrible solo. I don't see the diva in her too. She'll have a long way to go to catch up to the others."
1,This is ridiculous,"This album will soon be on sale for $1 in bins at truck stops across the county, so save your money. The rapping in really bad. It sounds like an after school special. There is no flow. She should have gone to ""Ice-T's Rap School."" Her voice is just plain annoying.Stick with the posing, sister."
1,Fergie - the Dutchess,the cd was in excellent condition but the music sucked.....i threw it awaytrashy language & boring
3,Pleanstly Surpised,"Fergie surpised the hell out of me with her debut CD ""The Dutchess"". Ferige can blow but she isn't the most soulful white girl in the game (that title belongs to Christina Aguilera) but this a nice CD. The lead single London Bridge is a track for the ladies but the track that has really grown on me is the ballad All That I've Got (The Make Up Song) which will soon make it's way on to my mix CD'S. Given the right production Fergie's next album could put in her leaauge with Christina and get her more respect from the urban commnunity. The CD isn't for all tastes but it's worth a listen."
2,what the....?,"To start off, her lyrics are terrible. Going beyond that is the trashiness of her songs and her videos. What is going on with the music industry these days? Is excessive plastic surgery all you need to make it? What about actual TALENT??By the way, what the heck is wrong with her face??"
4,Fergie-Ferg,"This album killed the Pop and Hot 100 Billboard charts, but what did you expect? I think the production on this great, and her lyrics are out of the norm. My favorite track on the entire album is ""London Bridge"". She totally does the unexpected, her lyrics being the opposite of what you would typically expect from a 'pop' artist. I recommend this album to all Black Eyed Peas fans; however if you don't like that group, you most likely won't like this album.---Pryncez"
3,Good cd,"a good cd that's sales speak for themselves. some great songs, but generally ok songs all around."
2,Not impressed,"I thought that London Bridge and Fergilicious were fun little tunes, so I decided to check out the entire CD. I really wanted to like this, but I couldn't do it. Fergie has a lovely voice and is a lovely lady, but 90% of the songs on this CD were awful to the point that I couldn't listen to them all the way through even once. And what is up with the need to spell everything ad nauseum? I kept the 2 songs that I liked originally - not that they are masterpieces of any consequence, but because they are fun and catchy - and relieved myself of the rest of the CD."
2,Meh,"This cd sort of sucks. I bought it on a whim and probably shouldn't have. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this.I'm not really a fan of hers, so maybe this cd is great for her and I just wouldn't know it. Perhaps only purchase this if you are already a fan."
3,Not what I expected.,"I like some of the songs on this cd, but it is much more rap-oriented than I had hoped. Fergie has a good sound, but many of these songs are more other artists. The lyrics are pretty explicit, as the label says. This is the first Fergie cd I've purchased, so maybe I'm just not a big fan, but I was a bit disappointed."
4,Enjoyable,"I'll give props where props is due. I certainly wasn't a fan of London Bridges and it wasn't until Fergalicious and Glamorous that I decided to give the CD a go. And surprisingly I found this CD highly entertaining and allows my morning workouts to be less arduous. Still LB, IMHO, was a mistake to be a first single release-which is why I think it took so long for this CD to reach platinum status. Overall, I don't think you will be disappointed with this purchase, however, I think her true muse is with BEP."
1,Why can't I put a rating of 0?,"Seriously, I don't know what I was even doing touching the case in the first place. My friend played it for me and made me suffer through it. Good thing I didn't hear it all. Seriously now, this has to be the worst album ever! It sounds like a 14 year old singing really high and playing with her keyboard. LONDON BRIDGE? Gwen ripoff! FERGALICIOUS? Fergalicious should be a word to describe something that tastes bad. So if you're a retard, buy this album. If you are not, the buy Gwen Stefani's new CD."
3,You can try and listen to it,I was not a big fan of BEP and was very leary of getting this CD but i did and I don't think it was a mistake but it surely not the best musical decision I ever made. This is not a bad CD to listen to but no one over 21 is going to be keeping in the player all the time. If you can stand to listen to all the way through once good for you because i couldn't it just wasn't that interesting.
3,not factory sealed,although this CD was delvered timely and at a good price. **This product was N O T factory sealed. This product seems to have been resealed. Not happy with getting a used product under the pretence that it was new.
3,Hmmmm............,"I think the people who really like this CD want to like it b/c they like Fergie and not b/c it's actually good music or even talented singing. Fergie is a great performer, dancer, etc. but it'd probably be better if she stuck w/ the BEP's b/c if not they're going to become even more succesful and she'll be left in the dark....I could dance to this and listen to it occasionally but it's def. not my new favorite CD."
1,She is such a Gwen-a-be,"How does Fergie keep changing her voice? The person who sang on ""Shut Up"" with the Black Eyed Peas could not possibly be the person vocalizing on ""Fergilicious."" Her music is horrible, lacks originality, and sounds as if she is trying to hop on the Gwen Stefani train. Fergie, you will never be as good as Gwen. (And that is saying a lot, because I think Gwen's solo album stinks, too.) Please, Fergie, stop! You're horrible."
2,Fergie - The Dutchess CD,"Other than the single ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" the CD was a bit of a letdown. I paid $16 for one single - not a good value in my opinion."
2,Fergie is hot but this CD isn't,"Really there are only 2 somewhat good songs. I'd suggest buying just the known songs, the other songs sound like filler for space. She is a great performer but I don't think she is a good song writer. She is beautiful."
2,Way off the mark,Songs 3 & 13 only good songs on this whole cd. Rest of Cd is worth forgetting. She should record love ballads & some smooth jazz songs on her next cd if she records a new anytime soon. George
4,Get Ready Cause Here I Come,"This album has bi polar disease. The first half is non sense rap, lyrics and music, all made up on the fly. She has lots of talent but is ill served by her producers who seemed to have phoned it in while on vacation. She deserved better. As for the lyrics, they are the equivalent of Jack Black Tenacious D songs. ""Ho"" this and ""B--"" that and ""F--- you which is all designed to titillate the under 16 crowd who can crow about having more foul mouthed rap music on their iPod.The second half has songs with great lyrics and melodies you could actually remember half an hour later. Big Girls Dont Cry is a number one if they release it for radio play."
2,Yeah...not so much,"While I feel that Fergie has some real vocal talent, I'm not digging this album. I bought it hoping for an up-beat, workout type album, but I was sadly disappointed. I like the reggae-type beat of Mary Jane Shoes,the fun beat of Fergalicious, and the realness of Losing My Ground and Finally. In the end, though, I can't help but shake the idea Fergie thinks she's a little hotter than she really is."
4,schizophrenic,"Most tracks are good, some great, but it goes from pop to jazz, to rock to rap...she pulls it all off well and I'm glad I bought the album, but the first time I listened to the whole thing I wasn't sure how I felt about it because I was so confused!I recommend it, but I wish they'd made a more consistent album by picking ONE idea to weave into it instead of six."
2,"Love Black Eyed Peas and Fergie, but not the album","There are two good songs on this album. Fergie does show that she has range, which is good. Unfortunately I expected more dance type music, there were only two songs that I actually liked."
1,Bad disc,"Love Fergie, and Love the CD, except mine must have been a bad disc. It plays for about 30 seconds and stops every time, no matter what player I put it in. That sucks :("
1,A joke.,"I simply cannot believe this is being marketed and sold. I regret spending my hard earned cash. I implore the music buyer: BEWARE. This EP is filled with, well, filler. Simply an attempt to bleed more out of an already over-produced LP. This is a joke. Her vocals are jokes. This LP should be listed in the Comedy section: Right next to Julie Brown's ""Trapped In The Body Of A White Girl""."
1,Are you serious?,"I simply cannot believe this is being marketed and sold. I regret spending my hard earned cash. I implore the music buyer: BEWARE. This EP is filled with, well, filler. Simply an attempt to bleed more out of an already over-produced LP. This is a joke. Her vocals are jokes. This LP should be listed in the Comedy section: Right next to Julie Brown's ""Trapped In The Body Of A White Girl""."
5,Diverse Hot and Fresh,Better than I could have expected. First artist who has such a range of songs on this CD that makes it impossible to pigeon hole her. One of the best CD's I've bought ever. She changes it up on every track. 90% of this CD could qualify as hit songs.
4,like it a lot,"It's a nice album. The first half very much Black Eyed Peas style, the second half a lot slower. A nice and well done combination."
3,Fergie Shines As She Loses Her Ground,"I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this cd. Especially the Sada/Esthero influenced slower ballads. Fergie's voice shines, skips and dances over the tracks. Dare I say she is the new ""Gwen Stefani"" Where Gwen's 2nd cd was all over the place and not very good, Fergie's cd shines and bounces throughout your eardrums.The lyrics are a little silly but the music and Fergie's vocals make up for the sometime childish tunes.Pop a lollipop in your mouth and get buck!Overall this is a funny, sexy and entertaining cd."
5,Fergie Delivers,"I disagree with the previous reviewer who said that Fergie does not reveal her inner-self in her album. Listen to the words to her song ""Glamorous"" and you'll hear her disclose past experiences that shaped her and made her the person that she is- she even builds one of the main refrains of the song around something her father told her (presumably when she was first starting out in the business).I always thought that Fergie was kind of trashy, but the beat of her music pulled me in during my workouts, and now that I have really taken the time to listen to her message, I have a new respect for her and what she went through to get to where she is. She comes across as ""tough"" in her public persona, but in this album she allowed herself to be vulnerable enough to disclose her personal thoughts, feelings and experiences. Love her or hate her, she keeps it real. And I think that these are the qualities of a good artist."
4,Interesting solo project...,"I really like the Black Eyed Peas, and I enjoyed Fergie's first singles, ""London Bridge"" and ""Fergalicious"", so I got this CD. There were some really great songs, and then some pretty crappy ones as well. However, I really did like this CD. If you purchase it, just remember, it won't be amazing; however, it's good dance music."
4,It is what it is,"Don't put all of your hope and dreams on Fergie. It is what it is... a fun, party album. If you're looking for more serious music, you're way out of your territory. Go pick up the greatest hits of Celine Dion or somebody. Sheesh."
3,Fergie Losing Her Ground,"Wow... I can consider this Album as a CD Single. Track ""London Bridge"" still hot no matter how much overplayed. ""Losing My Ground"" is incredible song. The music is very good and Fergie's voice is excellent. Not crazy about the other tracks but I like Fergie and the CD is worth checking out."
1,Where Is it??,"I'm still waiting for this product. I paid immediately with pay pal for the order. Since the product was NEVER received, why won't my money be refunded IMMEDIATELY??I rate this item ZERO because it was NEVER received!"
5,Stealing Lincoln's Body,"An amazing documentary on a little known part of Lincoln's history. It's hard to believe that such a thing could happen. Like many of the hardships suffered during Lincoln's life, his final resting place was 35+ years in the making. Very unfitting for one of the greatest Presidents of all time.A++++++ !"
5,My favorite President,Abe Lincoln has been my favorite president since I was a little child. I am now 62 and really enjoyed this documentary. It is a very well done and documented film. I enjoyed it very much.
2,Smells cheap,I bought this as a gift based on great reviews. I didn't like it at all. It smelled cheap and sweet. It reminded me of high school.I wouldn't recommend it if you are over the age of 20. Too embarrassed to gift it.I'm 31 and this is just too young/ trashy for me.
4,An Excellent Choice!,"This novel is a true example of the talent and genius of Mary Shelley. The novel illuminates a lot of Shelley's own personal fears, dreams and ideas concerning motherhood, love and failure. No, this book is not like the thrillers we see produced in Hollywood - but it IS an excellent representation of what real literature should be!!!"
5,Amazing!,"Two things are amazing. This book and the reviewer who says ""Despite many strengths, Frankenstein has fatal flaws"". I find it grotesque when ""critics"" pick apart a masterpiece, a work that the critic themselves couldn't create in their wildest dreams. A work that they couldn't match with anything in their boring lives.Yes, you can find something ""wrong"" in any work of art or science. But when something is so amazing as is this book (one of the greatest of all time, including the future), one should temper their criticism with praise. Point out all the good points , the amazing points, and the ""flaws"" will disappear as unimportant.Critics are so pitiful."
4,Just a thought....,"I'm just comenting on another reader's review. This person states that there were elements of symbolism of Marxism, Freudism, Feminism and more.... I'm just wondering how Mary Shelley was able to incorperate symbolism of these ideologies when they weren't even around until the late nineteenth century. Did Shelley posses ESP? Oh well, I guess it shows that you can twist the english language around until it means what you want it to."
