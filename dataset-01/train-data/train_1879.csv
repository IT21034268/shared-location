5,My son loves it!,"My son got this from his Aunt, along with a Thomas wooden rail set. Not sure if the toy was modified since some of the earlier reviews, but there is a metal square on the back end of the bus which the magnetic trains can attach to. It is a little larger than the other trains in the set which makes it a little harder to move on the tracks, but I find it working as long as it's set up on the hardwood floor (as opposed to the rug). My only small concern is that the battery already died after just a few days, but my son was playing with it constantly. Also, I had to move the couch twice to fetch it out. But he loves the bus, loves the train set, loves Thomas. Good gift!"
4,"Above Average, very informative","This was a great book in learning about Sam Houston, but it is also a history of Sam Houston's actions and influences in Texas before, during, and after Texas Independence. The book was not a difficult read."
1,Disappointing service,"Though the seller responded promptly, i would have liked to received a message that told me they no longer had the book that i was supposed to be buying, instead of me waiting three weeks for it to arrive."
4,Great Hat,"A great fitted cap. I don't really know what else to say. I've worn it a lot and has shown very little signs of stress. The ND insignia is somewhat fuzzy, but I threw mine in the wash so if I just trimmed the white hairs, I imagine it would be fine again."
3,Boring and predictable.,"I agree with the other reviewer that said Berg always falls apart in the third volume. I didn't care, I didn't get it. It bored me. I immediately put it on my stack for Half-Price Books."
2,My goodness ?,"The Soul Weaver was a horrendous disappointment. Although I dearly loved the first two books of this series and am a great fan of her 'Rai-Kirah' series (didn't care much for Song of the Beast), but this book falls apart at the seams. The action is disjointed and the book feels sloppy. To tell you the truth, I rather wondered if Carol Berg had died or was sick and someone else wrote into an outline for this book that they found lying around her house. It feels as if someone else wrote this book. At this point Daughter of Ancients (book 4 of the series September 2005) appears to be a risky venture.They can't all be good reviews..."
3,falls apart,"It seems that Berg's third book always fall apart. It happened with Restoration as well. It's as if she's rushing through the story. Her plot is vague yet obvious and I can see what's coming next. The ending is so transparent I couldn't believe it actually happened. I will continue to read Berg, just not expect her to maintain her plot through number three. She has a FOURTH book in this series coming out - will she be redeem herself?"
4,Small Town Girl makes good and finds herself in the process,"Lavyrle Spencer is a master at taking ordinary, everyday people and giving them a life. I am from the Nashville area and I could see every place she talked about. It made me feel like apart of the book. I do not like Romance books that have perfect human specimans as their characters, who have no story, just sex. L.S. takes real characters and gives them a story and a life. I have every one of her books and I love her. She is a master at her craft. GREAT!!!"
5,"Loved it, of course","I've been in love with her books since I first read ""Years"" many, many years ago. When someone asks me who my favorite author is, Lavyrle Spencer is always one of the first names I come up with. The minute I spied her newest book on the shelf I snapped it up. I'm glad to say she didn't disappoint me again. I loved the setting, the characters, everything about the book. What I like best is the way her characters struggle through a variety of ups and downs but always become better people at the end. They change as they learn and grow through their relationships with friends and loved ones. As far as ""feel good"" books go, Lavyrle Spencer is #1"
1,It could have been great...,"I was with this book right up to the end. Some may not find it believable that a country star would fall for the high school dork, but I found the romance rather redemptive for the cruel way Tess treated Kenny in high school. Besides, who hasn't read about the ugly duckling heroine who turns into a beautiful swan? This is a great twist with the hero being the ugly duckling turned swan.But LaVyrle lost me at the end when Tess announces to Kenny (while the two are in bed, no less) that she never wants to have children with him because her career is ""too important"" to her. Huh? A singer of the kind of music that traditionally celebrates family is putting her career over the family she might have built with her true love? Makes you wonder just how much Tess really loves Kenny and such wondering on the part of a reader spells the death of any hope for a successful romance novel.This book can be summed up in five words: In the end, a disappointment."
5,Love small towns,"I have this book in paperback. I had it for years! I usually only read a select few books over every year. This is one of them... I love this book. In the paperback review, there are some reviews that do not give this book a good review,so I guess everyone will have to decide for themselves. I think this book has everything. Sisters, romance, family, some laughs and some tears. It tells of a young singer making it big and then coming back home after 15 years, to her small town to take care of her mamma after surgery. At first she deals with coming home with bitterness... it goes from there. I love, love this book."
2,I liked this book.,"This was a good easy read book. It was not as involved as Spencer's other books but I liked Tess and Kenny. Their story started off with sparks of anger from the past, but the love story was a bit too ""happy-ever-afterish"". I had hoped that more attention would be focused on Tess and her jealous older sister's relationship. I still liked the story even though it lacked the realism that Ms. Spencer's other books have."
2,Disappointed,"I read another of LaVyrle Spencer's books before, and really loved it (Twice Loved), so I started this one with high expectations.The writing was fluid, the characters were interesting, but I just couldn't get past the idea that the heroine stole the hero away from another woman (whom he had been seeing for 8 years -- and was happy with until the millionaire superstar heroine came onto the scene.)The hero didn't enter his new relationship cleanly, either. There were a few instances of kissing (one while rolling on the grass) while his girlfriend was kept in the dark.I don't know about other readers, but I can't admire a hero who cheats on his girlfriend, or a heroine who steals a man from another woman.I have another book by Spencer waiting for me to read, and I don't know if I'll bother."
5,Fabulous and thoroughly enjoyable,"This was the first book that I have read by Spencer and I couldn't put it down. I've read and re-read it and enjoy the well-crafted turn of phrases with each new read. The characters are great, their dialogue fun to follow and their developing love wonderful. There were several times when I felt my heart clench while reading a particularly lovely part of the book. I've tried other Spencer books since and, although each has been enjoyable, this is my all time favorite."
3,Not great.,"This was one of those books that was easy to read into. I suppose Tess is just one of those characters I couldn't relate to, she didn't seem real to me. I loved Casey, I thought she was a jewel. So real and full of life. Kenny was fine, I just have a hard time believing he left his current girlfriend for a girl he had dreams about years ago. And that Tess just fell head over heals for him after doing nothing but talking bad about him. I will read more from this author but I would stay away from this one if I were you. There's bound to be better Spencer books!"
3,Didn't keep my interest,"I'm sorry LaVyrle, love you as I do, Small Town Girl just didn't keep my interest. The romance just didn't seem believeable and I was easily bored and felt the book was just thrown together. Why would she love a dork from her high school? My opinion, steer clear and go for one of those country music hunks."
3,"Almost a page turner, but a fun, light read.","Although LaVyrle Spencer is indeed a captivating writer, this book just seems to hold on before dropping to the rest in the cheesy book pile. At some points this novel is completely unrealistic, even for a novel. I can't beleive that Tess would actually married some dork from high school that she knew for a whole two months. In addition, after Tess goes back to Nashville there is very little real plot left; no conflict. Spencer could have said all she did in about half those pages. At some points it did get boring. And what was with all the references to food and what Tess ate? It just seemed thrown in as did the conflict with Judy, which was greatly under-developed. Yet, the book held my interest and I am glad it was a happy ending. I just wish more was left for the reader to fill in. Some of Spencer's other works are much more captivating."
3,Easy feel-good reading,Small Town Girl is easy and feel-good reading capturing many of the general feelings and emotions of the reader.Perfect for inclusion in your holiday leasure reading.
5,Best introduction to the sicilian defence,"This is an INTRODUCTION to the sicilian, it will give you an overview of the basic plans in the most common lines. I think it is well written, and does not go too deeply into variations. My only complaints are twofold:1: No index of variations2: Ordering of systems. Dragon is first, Najdorf is second, c3 is nearly last. I think c3 should be first, because it is less theoretically sharp, but that's a quibble.I recommend this book to everyone who is thinking of playing the sicilian or plays against it often. I'm a Caro-Kann player by heart, but I think some knowledge of the sicilian will help me as white when I play 1. e4 -- perhaps i'll even start playing something besides 2. c3 with a little bit of theoretical backing."
3,For the beginning player,"This ""Starting Out: The Sicilian"" is already quite dated as an opening book. With many lines claimed as mainline that have slipped a bit in popularity and validity.The coverage is so brief...given the breadth and depth of the Sicilian that you really get little but a quick overview of most of the lines.I recommend this book to someone who is interested in the Sicilian and would like to have a quick taste of all of the lines before making a move to a more specialized and more useful book."
5,Great intro to sicilian!,includes and all sub opening its a great book that will help you and is in very friendly language so u understand overall a great buy
5,Mommom Deb,"I loved this book! It was exactly what we needed! We had just gotten a Bouvier puppy and were thrilled. Since our dog knowledge was border collies and labs, I was looking for a book to give me some history and pointers on the Bouviers. This book is it! However, I did find it amusing that the author of the book states that you shouldn't buy fawn, grey or washed out color Bouviers as they have been overbred. The Bouviers on the COVER of the book are fawn colored; fawn colored Bouviers are featured throughout the book! Other than that it was a great book with lots of information on Bouviers des Flandres."
4,Storyline is great...,But some of hte acting is a little off. Very sweet story and great music to go along wtih it
4,Dysfunctional Families,"I watched this movie back when I first came out, but wanted to own it because I would get in discussions with people about things I can't understand about prejudgeous and hate. This movie is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. I could not understand how a man would want to kill his own son when he was 3 or 4 years old or an adult because it was an inconvienence to him and he was another race. To me that is pure evil. I have told people about this story who have not seen the film. Although this was not a big Hollywood blockbuster, it has a lot to say about hate and a reminder of just how dysfunctional ""family"" can beSioux City."
5,Exceptional Movie,"A wonderful Native American movie with many lessons for everyone to learn. Have the kleenex ready!! Soundtrack is available seperatly, buy it!!"
3,average,"this is an average movie not really exciting or anything, but pretty decent story line it was worth the money i paid."
5,His mother gave him away,"Jesse gets a birthday presant from his birth mother, Who died in a house fire.Great movie!"
5,VERY TASTY,THESE HEALTHY BROWN RICE CRACKERS ARE VERY TASTY. I HAVE BEEN ON A CANDIDA DIET FOR 10 MOS. AND HAVE LOST 95#'S AND BEING ABLE TO EAT THESE CRACKERS (THE ONION AND GARLIC ARE THE ONLY FLAVOR YOU ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE ON THIS DIET) HELPED ALLOT. YOU DON'T FEEL SO DEPRIVED OF CARBS. THE ONLY THING I WAS DISAPPOINTED W/ WHILE ORDERING FROM [...] WAS ONE BOX OF 12PACKAGES.... WERE BROKEN UP SOMEWHAT....BOX WAS PROBABLY THROWN AROUND ONE TOO MANY TIMES IN ROUTE? I SAVE MONEY BUYING THEM FROM [...] COMPARED TO MY LOCAL HEALTH FOOD STORE.ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY COME STRAIGHT TO MY DOOR.
5,un petit bouquin merveilleux,"A friend gave me this book a while back and I found it delightful.I wanted to give the book to my sister, who has just begun studying French and is making amazing progress - and who is a cat lover. It's no longer in print, but I was able to find it at a reasonable price from an Amazon Marketplace Seller (Artitudes) who provided quick and excellent service (in addition to beautiful giftwrapping). My sister loves her ""petit cadeau"" (little gift)."
4,good product,"works well - - hard to use with bigger brushes. Be SURE to put in bucket when spinning - - or you do your pants, and the WHOLE HOUSE in spatter."
3,PLEASE HELP/SHOW ME HOW TO USE THIS,"I am only giving this three stars right now, because I have NO idea how to use it (yes, I'm a girl lol).Can someone PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do a VIDEO demonstration on how to use it????I have looked everywhere on YouTube for a tutorial, and I can't find one.I don't want to return it yet, because the reviews are so good... I just need to figure out how to use it lol.Mainly for paint brushes, but rollers too would be great.PLEASE SOMEONE MAKE A HOW TO VIDEO for me! I would be ever so grateful <3"
4,Can't have the Dora House without Abuela!,"I gave my daughter the Dora Talking Dollhouse for Christmas with all the characters and accessories. The first thing she said after the excitment wore off was, ""Where's mi Abuela?"". After hunting, I found her! She doesn't have moving parts like the other Dora characters, but she is still a wonderful addition. It teaches kids about extended family."
4,deliciously different,"I recieved this book as a gift two summers ago, and it's long since been a favorite. The mixed berry cobbler is to die for, and most of the other recipes are just as simple and wonderful to prepare and devour. A few suggestions, though. The authors never inform us when to remove the shells for the barbequed shrimp, and we are asked to baste the grilled chicken with bricks sitting on top of them! Nothing a more meticulous editor couldn't have caught. I really do like books that mention a little something about the recipes before simply listing the ingredients and method. I don't know about anyone else, but you really get a feel for the authors's passion for good food. Yummy."
3,Inaccurate and incomplete recipes,I was initially very excited about this cookbook until I began to acually put it to use. On two different occasions I have found receipes where there have been incomplete or confusing directions. The Parmesean Crips for example list a 1/2 tsp of butter in the ingredient listing but do not tell you when or where to add in the receipe! I have also found that in the Pork Tenderloin with Fruit and Port Sauce they instruct you to preheat an oven but do not tell you when and for how long to bake the dish. Friends that own the cookbook were equally confused. This is disasterous particually when entertaining-which is what this book is all about.
1,Firm and adjustable,"personal opinion: DO NOT BUY !it took less than a week for this item to be defectiveThe second tier's handles will break, only the first tier will standI think is product should NOT be here, not compliant with the minimum QA"
4,Worked well for covering so many countries,"Last summer, I found this book much more useful for visiting Central America than its Let's Go counterpart which was riddled with more inaccuracies and fewer maps. However, I cannot speak to the Rough Guide, which some seem to prefer. Overall, maps to the major cities are there, and the bus info is very helpfu. Where there aren't maps, navigating becomes much more difficult. For this reason, if visiting many countries, it may be best to pick up country guides along the way. They tend to include more of the details (and more out of the way places) that make getting around much easier."
2,Metal stake not enough to secure this into the ground,We bought this sprinkler for watering our yard and after about a weeks use the metal stake started bending because a combination of the force of the impulse and the hold on the stake by the hose caused it to bend. I assume after awhile the stake will break off.
4,perfectly good drywall gun,"I bought this gun refurbished (reconditioned). It seems well made and it works well. The cord is quite long. It is fast as can be (haven't tried the 6k rpm versions, but this sinks 1 1/4 dwall screws almost instantly). I am not sure why the nose is so darn long, except that maybe it helps keep a decent angle in the corners. sinks #6 drywall screws without noticing. I tried driving some 3"" deckmates just to see how the gun did, and while it can sink 'em no problem there is some slowdown. On the other hand it put 1 5/8 rock-on screws through durarock no problem. I'd give it a 5 if mine came with short and long nosepieces."
1,Worst Purchase I ever made,"I wouldn't even give this item a star it is a zero. I gave it as a gift to my son who was able to put 2 screws into the wall and it quit. I took it to a machinist to see if it could be fixed and altho he got it to run again, it only screwed 2 screws and quit. From the beginning it was a lemon. When the load was applied to the screw, some sort of auto release kicked in and wouldn't let it screw in the screw. I hope no one else will buy this screwdrive and get ""screwed"" like I did."
2,Not happy,"So far this device has not worked the way it was intended to. Also, the shipping and handling is more the price of the opener. Over all, I am feeling liek I wasted money."
2,Very Uncomfortable!!,"As the other reviewer said, it's a very elegant shoes, i love its design, but it's very uncomfortable, the manufacturer stated ""lightly paded for comfort"" gimme a break. i cant stand wearing it for any special occasions, 1 hour and my toes hurt because of the ultra tight strings. trust me it looks nice, but maybe you should go look for a more comfortable shoes!"
2,Ehhhh,I love stilletos! But these were so uncomfortable and awkward!! Ive been walking in heels since I was 8 but maybe these were to cheaply made for my feet because they were not comfy
3,Looks Good....Til You Take Them Off,"So, I got these shoes because my old black stilettos were shot. When I received them and put them on, they looked and felt great.However, when I went to take them off, there were black marks all over my ankles, toes, and hands. It washed off easily, but I am wary of putting on the shoes again, for fear that if I wear them for a long period of time my feet or hands might stain more permanently."
1,MY FEET ARE BLACK!,"These shoes are terrible! First, my feet are black... They have literally turned my feet BLACK! On top of that, the hard piece material that goes up the back of my leg not only has scraped the skin off of the back of my leg, it makes it almost impossible to bend my ankle. My advise is to spend a little extra on a pair of shoes that aren't trash."
2,Cute but Faulty,"The shoes are really cute, but the first time I wore them the little peg on the heal fell off before I got out the house. :o("
3,hurts!,the back zipper hurts my skin! cute but not comfortable! i have heels higher than this but they are comfortable..not bad for its price..so far not really happy with it..
5,Wristbands,"The wristbands do come in a pair, and I think they're great. There is a small tag in one of the wristbands, and it's not a big deal, I just didn't expect it to be there. Other than that being there, they matched my expectations and they have good absorption. I mean if you dip them in bucket of water they won't absorb the bucket dry. I really like these wristbands and I think they look really cool. I hope I helped you if you were considering these."
1,Hated It,"I don't like the way Ms. Oates writes. This is the first novel I've read by her and will probably be my last. I heard she was very good, so I was quite surprised when I realized how disappointing this story was. Basically, reading this novel was like watching a bad episode of Oprah, but with slightly less substance and entertainment. Perhaps the proper response that Oates wanted to evoke in her readers was for everyone to nod in girl-power agreement as they do on Oprah. Maybe my literary tastes are too lofty, but this novel needs to provide more than that facile analysis of rape that one could get on daytime talk-shows, namely, that stock interretation that states that rape is not only rape of the body but a rape of the soul. Oates should stop resting on her laurels or she will run the risk of becoming redundant."
2,Nothing Remarkable Here,"First, I must say this: Ms. Oates, please get yourself a decent editor. This isn't the first work I've read of hers that had grammatical errors.Dunno what I was expecting in this book. A new perspective, perhaps? Sadly, this novella was simply a rape story with the 'bad cop' taking justice into his own hands. I've watched lifetime movies that were better than this. The story was bland, the plot predictable.If you're looking for similar subject matter, try reading Alice Sebold's brave, gripping memoir, ""Lucky"".Reading Oates' ""Beasts"" next. I hope it's better."
1,Couldn't Get Into It,I couldn't get into this book. I expected a lot more. But I just became bored with the story. Maybe I should pick up something else by her.
2,I Didn't Really Get It,"Men are evil, and women...well that's another story. I didn't get it. Call me morbid, but I did rather enjoyed the death of the rapists. That's all I got to say on that."
1,Horrible. Don't read this.,"I'm not sure why Joyce Carol Oates thought it was necessary to write about something you watch on TV and read in the newspapers everyday. Why bother? Her obsession with these kind of topics, without adding anything new, is grossly disturbing."
4,"""She had it coming. She asked for it.""","I've hesitated reading RAPE: A LOVE STORY since it was published; the idea of reading about a rape never constituted pleasure reading for me with any stretch of imagination. But to tell the truth, I was also intrigued by the subtitle ""A Love Story"". Something was telling me that Joyce Carol Oates was going to put an eccentric spin on a terrible sequence of events and for that I wasn't disappointed.I read this novella in one setting and it was a very difficult and painful experience for me. Oates creates a typical situation in which the victim is ruthlessly blamed for her demise while the perpetrators receive the community's sympathy. In this rendition of this tale the victim has the backing of a renegade who takes matters into his own hands to right the wrongs of the faulty criminal justice system.In retrospect RAPE: A LOVE STORY is worth reading and to a degree necessary, not just for fans of Joyce Carol Oates but also for individuals everywhere. Recommended."
4,Tragic yet Beautiful,"This novella is a great example of Oates' powerful grasp on emotions and language. I particularly loved the shift in narrator, from character to character (although predominantly told by the daughter) and I loved the use of second person narration.This is a heavy novella and I thought it best that Oates left it at 150 pages. Anymore and you'd be ready to call your psychiatrist for a higher dose of anti-depressants. This is a tragic story of a rape yet a beautiful story of the love between a mother and daughter. It's short enough to read in one sitting, which is best because it's hard to put down."
4,Truth,This book is not well written but it tells the truth of how rape victims are treated. Love the ending!
3,Deja Vu,"If this novelette had not been written by Ms. Oates, 'Rape' would probably have received 5 stars by now. However, with yet another published book by her this year, it doesn't seem that JCO is trying to write about anything new or invigorating. Personally,I am still waiting for Ms. Oates to stop writing so much and concentrate on writing The great american novel of the 21st century. There's no doubt in my mind that she is the only living novelist capable to do this."
5,Smells just like a coffee shop!,"I loved this candle so much that I went out and bought a second one when I used up my first one! I don't like coffee but love the way this smells! It smells like great smelling coffee! If you've ever walked by a coffee shop then you know what I am talking about. (No, not the famous green label one either). I love Yankee they really do have ""true to life"" smells. I can't imgaine anyone not liking this candle!"
4,Self learning Tai Chi,"This is the only one book I know, you can really learn by your self Tai Chi step by step, I've been exersicing it by 30 years.When I begun, in Chile, my country the Tai Chi was unknown. This book made it possible for me to catch the Tai Chi."
3,"Comfortable, but very heavy","The CleenFreek Sport Thong is comfortable, and seems sturdy. But, it is surprisingly heavy. A noticable addition to the weight of one's gym bag."
2,A book review--and little more.,"I don't want to rewrite this article. I thought it was overpriced for very little information. The book reviewed was ""Sex is Not a Natural Act"" 2nd edition by Leonore Tiefer. Tiefer stressed that sex was a social act and not biological. I guess I'll have to look up Tiefer's book."
1,"if possible, I'd get this book less than one star","In comparison to ""Whole Earth Catalog:Access to Tools"" the Millenium Edition was - at least to my tastes - horrifyingly bad. ""Access to Tools"" presented information to solve problems. The Millenium Edition seemed to be more about winning arguments, and how to repair your local <insert tedious political problem here.>Reading about how aging yuppies want to fix a neighborhood block to their tastes isn't worth 1 dime of my money. I feel disappointed and deeply cheated that I bought this tawdry book."
1,A little buggy,"Don't put the outdoor sensor outdoors! There is a small hole in the bottom of the unit that Earwigs can get into. The transmitter stopped working after two weeks outside. Upon inspection, the thing was packed with Earwigs! I'm not kidding, there were at least a dozen inside. They must have chewed something up, because the transmitter has not worked since. I contacted customer service and have been waiting two weeks for an RMA. I've had a La Crosse unit at home for at least five years with no problems."
3,Not bad item but don't buy the extra sensor,The base station and one sensor modual is ok. BUT don't buy the special deal with the extra modual. It is not the one for this item. Vendor has been slow to deal with the return and has not pulled add after three or four calls/E-mails
3,just okay,was slow to register temps from outside source...temperture off by a few degrees---maybe not much to make a big difference...but if you need one that is right on the money--would not buy this product.
1,Worst yet,"This is the worst product, more than half the time it doesn't work for the outside temp.I guess if you live in the midwest it's too cold to workThe instructions stat in cold weather it may not work OK DAH!!!!!!!!!!!! then why sell it. VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT"
4,Does the job,I purchased this product for my sewing machine repair business. I needed the stubby ones for some tight spaces on my machines. I Think that the are a quality product. I am going to have to have the 2mm replaced as the ball end has rounded off already. That is the reason for the 4. I am not sure what could be done besides to make them a little more hardened.
5,Best price that I've seen! Fast shipping as well.,"There may be better deals out there, but I haven't found them. My wife and I take Echinacea sporadically (if you take it constantly it blunts its immune boosting effect), and since starting this regimen we are sick far less often, and the duration of colds has been shortened by several days vs. ""pre-echinacea"".These also don't have the awful smell that some echinacea products have."
4,2 year old nephew loves it,"The toy is smaller than I anticipated, but my nephew is a huge Thomas and Friends fan and loved the toy. Plus the width of the wooden toy fits the wooden track that his motorized Thomas and friends engines fit on, which made it even better."
5,Bought for a homeless child who said he loved trains.,Didn't get to see his reaction but it got here on time and in his box when it left here.
4,Paint chips but I will like this toy,"My son lives it and carries it wherever he goes, I just wish the paint did not chip so easily."
2,paint worn,"I was very excited to get this toy for my little boy. it said it was in good condition but the paint was very worn off in places the toy looked horrable.so I repainted it,and it looked brand new and gave it to him for his birthday."
5,"Good, solid toy.","My son lives this toy - he will be 2 in 2 weeks and we bought this to go with a train table that is for his birthday. We ended up giving him both the table and the train early and he loves them both. The table is actually NOT Thomas branded but from Toys R Us, (the Iamginarium brand). The train totally fits on the table and works with all the bells and whistles that came with the table. Seems like a soild, sturdy toy. I didn't give it much for being educational because it's a wooden toy train - not much education to that :)"
4,Kids love it,"The kids love this train, plus the Thomas train I got with it. They have little magnet bits on the ends so the trains can stick together. The trains themselves were a little smaller than I expected, but the kids don't seem to mind, although they keep getting lost because they are so small. The toy is colorful, well-built, and the kids love it."
3,In less than 20 minutes...,"I purchased Percy for my son - a huge Thomas (or any train) fan. Within 20 minutes of opening the package, the paint was peeled off in 4 different places. I don't know if it was missing in 3 spots already, but at least 1 was done after he got it. I wrote to the company, but haven't heard back from the yet. I hope this is a fluke, as I would love to get the collection for my son, but will not spend that kind of money on trains that won't hold up."
1,smh,"I bought this toy for my son.I was extremely disappointed fromt the moment I saw it.It was way smaller than I thought,and the price is ridicolous for this little truck.my son doesn't even play with it."
1,"Bad, It didnt worked for me","I got this product from Amazon. I am very unhappy to see not working. Unfortunately there is no support team to help too. In the end I have to return this one back. I got the similar one from RadioShack. Though this is expensive, works best for me."
2,too much money for what you get,"Its a ""cheap"" solution to computers without TV out, but the signal is crappy and noise sometimes. The power cable (USB) is clunky and I think this device is poorly made. Better buy a PCI video card with TV OUT if you're limited by hardware, they're awesome for this purpose."
1,Predictable and boring,This appeared to be a cast doing improv. There was nothing clever about it and and it showed. Decidedly predictable and boring. I couldn't get through 5 min. of it.
1,Disappointed!,"Ink level monitor is a joke, when it was still printing great, it show ink out (which is not true) and stop printing.Head cleaning always clean both black and color, bad idea, it could end up use up half of the ink without having both heads in clean condition the same time.With 2 of the above, I am staying away from Epson forever."
5,tough truck,"This truck is very durable, I had a hard time finding a truck this size that the doors didn't just fall of after a few days. It can take plenty of abuse and still is fine. A good price for what you get, because it will last."
1,This is not what I ordered!,The soy chips I ordered are not the ones that were shipped to me. They have changed the product and it was not presented in the item details when I placed my order. The item description that I ordered still has the old bag pictured with the old nutritional information. The nutrition is now different and the taste is also different. In my opinion they are not nearly as good! I am very disappointed because had I know about the change I never would have ordered them! They are nonreturnable so I am stuck with a lot of something that I did not order and did not want!
4,one of my favorites,"These are one of my favorite ways to eat grains Plus they are a good source of protein. 17 chips per serving is just about right. I wish they had a little less salt but for the calorie/fat/fiber content, they are pretty healthy. Great with soup or salads or just plain. I would definitely recommend these."
4,Pretty Good,"I'm a big fan of the carbs, fat and protein balance of these crisps. The salt isn't overpowering and the taste is OK. I've had better soy chips (Genisoy Tortilla Chips) but these are alright if you don't like the crunch of a chip."
1,Inconsistent quality,I have been purchasing this product for about 9 months. The taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number. I have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all. Have contacted the manufacturer 2 times. Have not received a response from my latest inquiry. I don't recommend purchasing.
1,Terrible!,"I bought these because I had decided I wanted to eat, and even snack, healthier. These had so many good reviews, so I decided to try them. I admit, it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first. When I opened them, they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them......it tasted just like a rice cake/styrofoam with salt on it. They also have a very unusual texture. The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing. My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way - not even the dog would eat them. We tried them with a variety of dips and couldn't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down.Luckily, I have a niece that is newly vegetarian, hungry all the time, and she took these off my hands. I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with...what a waste!"
3,Aleksandr Lebed was a man to watch...,"Unfortunately, he was killed in a helicopter crash in Krasnoyarsk, Russia...Spring of 2002."
2,big disappointment,"I purchased Spiderman Slip 'n Slide to replace a double-wide on that my kids wore out. The Spiderman one looks cool, but the water sprays only from one narrow tube on one side. When the tube fills with water, the tube tends to twist. This results in some of the water spraying away to the left of the slide and only some of it sprays on the slide (if you are lucky). We had a hard time getting the water pressure just right so that the water spray actually landed on the slide and not in the grass.I would, however, strongly recommend any double lane or racing slip 'n slide since with those slides, your hose is attached to a tube that runs down the middle of the slip 'n slide and thoroughly wets the entire slide."
3,"Good for the superhero, OK for the price","This product is worth it if the kids using it love Spider-Man. It is fun, but cost twice as much as other slip 'n slides with the same features when we purchsed it. There were double slides, or triple slides, with a pools at the end for the same price. Then again, those slides don't have a Spider-Man theme."
3,Number 10,"I waited for the series for so many years, sadly as I watched my favourite episode ""Bloodline"" (with Jeremy Brett as William Pitt the Younger), I noticed that an entire scene was missing.The picture quality is not the best and the bonus features only contains short biographies of the prime ministers on each disc, they are not as informative as you might think or hope.I can only hope that they might release the series again with the missing bits!"
5,SPECIAL KRISTOFFERSON,"This was recorded live at the Philharmonic Hall 12/02/72 and is EXCELLENT...also has Willie Nelson and Rita Coolidge...there is even a song on this cd that I had never heard before(LATE AGAIN) which is great. If you love Kristofferson, you will love this."
5,hipsteel,Very happy with this purchase. Received when promised and looks and sounds good. I will be buying more music in the future.
1,Not Worth Your Money,"So the show is called ""60 Minutes"" right? Why, then, is this a 14-minute segment about MMA? I bought this video thinking that it was a documentary. I wanted an inside look at the world of MMA. But it was none of that. It is a 14-minute segment, which has an interview with Renzo Gracie and a few other fighters. They talk about their views on MMA. That's it. Not worth your money!!!"
1,Way smaller than I thought!!,"This product was a waste of money and made me quite mad! I bought this for my dad for Father's day and I shipped it directly to him. I bought this item a week before Father's day and he didn't get it until a week AFTER Father's day, and it was tiny! Apparently, it is only about 2 inches tall! Overall, I was VERY disappointed."
3,Maria's Majesty,"Kirsten, a young athletic girl, lives in the West in the past. Kirsten brings a weak baby raccoon to her house after going trapping with Lars and John, her brother and friend. Will the baby raccoon cause any trouble? Kirsten brought it into the house. When it was running, it hit a burning lamp and knocked it over. Suddenly the cabin was on fire!!!!! I think this is a really good book, because it is very exciting. I recommend this book to people who will read it and not take my word for it."
2,Shur Line 06100C Gallon Can Paint Pourer,"It is a mess to use it, paint all over the can. I cleaned it which was the only good then about this item. I would not buy it again."
4,Very Informative Book,"This is the perfect book for anyone who has never quite understood how the electoral college works (or, even, why we still use it) in national elections for the President. It highlights the historical foundations for its formation, as well as specific, historical examples--where its existence has proven to be questionable (at best), in terms of electing the President of the U.S. This book's timeliness can be seen in the current presidential-election situation--which has called into question the electoral college's capability, in being able to elect ""the people's choice"" to the presidency."
1,Terrible.,"I have other Gold Toe socks. Those are excellent. This particular model has terrible elastic at the top, making them sink well into my shoes around the heel after walking around in them briefly at work. On the upside, I'm sure it looks sexy to all the females when I'm spending most of my morning pulling my socks up."
2,good for drywall,but i work in a cargo trailer factor and this gun in not a good gun for that although it should be cuz that is what we use is drywall guns but the gun i got off of here the clutch was wore out in 3 days so iam out over $100 cuz it should have worked better than it really did so for all of you meatal hangers out the dont get this gun but if you into drywall this is the gun thanks for your time and i dont meant to be rude but i should grt my money back but i know that it does not work that way so iam out o well thats the way it goes fro me
3,Robert Conrad and Robert Golem?,Interesting film for a tv movie but not interesting enough to be done for theatres.
2,Understanding What Your Order,"I was happy to have found the book I had been seeking, and trusted, (a word that should never be utilized in net-purchases)it to be new or nearly so, as the price was just that. However when I received the book I found reader notes amuck.I seldom if ever destroy the sacred pages of a book, especially one by such a beloved author with mindless ramblings but others do it and that is fine for them but they should NEVER attempt their resale with-out notice. This book is useless to me!"
3,Feels great but very cheap made,"Oh only if this thing was better quality it would be heaven sent.Got started and right in middle of my enjoyment, bam the damn thingjust quit, and after 10 minutes of trying to fix it, the mood leavesand it just a bummer."
2,"Good for the money, when it works...","This lasted a month, exactly... it quit a few hours ago. Just watch the wire-especially where it meets the bullet!!! Be VERY gentle with it (I was, and it still broke).But when it works... WOW. I used it 2+ times a day, every day. My first toy, and I couldn't have been happier! I'm not replacing this vibe, not yet. I'm trying out other things, though I'm sure I'll be back to give this fun and functional vibe another shot. :)EDIT:: I came back to this vibe, it's still my favorite bullet.. now I just make sure I have more than one in my house in case of a break-down..AND YET ANOTHER EDIT:: I've gone through 4 of these in a year, and I'm done with it. The first one was wonderful, as was the second (but even they circuited out). The third was insanely loud, and the fourth only vibrated on two low settings. Beginners might want to give this a shot, but be prepared to dish out more money for replacements!!"
1,total disappointment,"second one I bought because 1st one quit on me the third time using it. The pleasure was so great that I hoped the second one would be better made, but the second was even worse! It lasted about 5 minutes without pulling or tugging, not being rough, and the wires were completely out of the bullet like they were never attached, just stuck in there.I was hopeful for this product, but in the end, I was completely disappointed!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Stan Kelly:Artist Engineer,"Stan Kelly was a railroad engineer who loved eucalyptus and spent his time hunting rare species and painting them with water color paints.His two volumnes contain exquisite paintings of 500 species of eucalupts, with concise descriptions of each species by eminent botonists in the field."
4,"Nice Style, Great Warmth","This jacket is really great. I bought it for my boyfriend and he absolutly loves it. For anyone who is looking for style and warmth, this jacket is for you. And, it's also reversible, so you don't have to go out and buy another jacket! Very nice selection and great for the price!"
3,Haven't tried any yet,"Got this book when it was free, I have scanned through the recipes, they look good but I haven't had time to try it out. Not against the book, but recipes on Kindle is a bit of a downfall because I like to see pictures. This book has none, but the hard copy version might have colorful pictures."
2,Havana cookbook,"I purchased this book because my family is from Havana, Cuba, and I felt I could get some good authentic recipes. I was very dissapointed. My grandmother who has shown me how to cook cuban food was even surprised at some of the ingredients in the recipes. The recipes are from foods we eat but the ingredients were way off. Sorry just my opinion"
2,Old Havana Cookbook not so old,"I purchased this book to learn about cuban cooking. I showed some of the recipes to a friend who is Cuban. She was surprised at how the Ropa Vieja dish was suggested to be cooked, she said that you typically have cumin in the dish and avoid the turnips, leeks, carrots. Did not feel authentic at all. Think that there are better cuban cookbooks out there."
2,Not what I expected...,"I'm Cuban by birth, but have lived in this country for over 50 years. I enjoy cooking and often whip up some Cuban dishes for friends and family alike. I wanted to add this one to my collection because it sounded interesting. I don't know what I was expecting, but it is a very small book and just isn't what I was hoping it would be. It has a diverse amount of recipes, but for those not familiar with Cuban cuisine might prefer some of the more traditional recipes."
4,good,"The cookbooks on the kindle reader are very very good but i do not think they will ever replace a real cookbook just because it doesn't have the same feel. you cant make the scribbled notes in the corner and it just is not the same while working in the kitchen.although, this cookbooks recipes seem very very good and i can not wait to try some of them!"
1,Lacking,"This was an interesting, early attempt at compiling a cookbook of Cuban recipes. Having the book in two languages may help your local library, but most chefs speak one language or the other -- the result is a lot of wasted space. The simple graphics and lack of photos are uninspiring and there is nothing here that will entice or motivate you. A better choice for contemporary Cuban cuisine: Three Guys from Miami Cook Cuban <ASIN: 158685433X>."
5,Toby,Everything was ok. The Toby Tram Engine is excellent !I offer it Everybody who like Thomas and his friends!
4,Toby for the wooden tracks,"Toby arrived just as pictured. Made of wood (main body) and plastic (top and bottom) and fits with the other wooden Thomas the trains on the wooden track. We've been looking for Toby for a while, and now we finally have him!"
5,Yay for Toby!,"I, personally, think this is a weird-looking train. But what does that matter? My son loves him. All of these toys are quality products."
3,Eh it's okay,"I bought this train to go along with ""Toby's Windmill"", otherwise I would never have purchased Toby. My son loves Thomas and loves this train but it does not capture his attention for long as it makes no noise and he is unfamiliar with Toby (he is more familiar with THomas, Percy, James, etc.). Over-all, it's nice to have to accompany the wind-mill but not that impressive."
1,NOT a smart purchase on my part ....,"Cannot be one of Ms Cleery's best .... poorly put together, one selection is barely audible, next you have to turn volume way down because it is TOO loud ... this ia a live recording and not my favorite type of CD ..."
4,Nice Umbrella!,"Just got mine today. I bought 2 garnet umbrellas for my patio furniture. Fabric was nice and thick and setup was a breeze. I like the pin and pulley method used on these instead of the crank style which was my old umbrella. Can't beat the price for these. Only complaint is that the outside of the pole is easily scratched. Overall, great umbrellas and a better price. Fast shipping also!"
2,umbrella,"This umbrella is heavy and hard to raise as you have to stand on the picnic table or chair and get underneath it to raise it and put in the pin. It is the same process to lower it. I am 5'4"" tall so if you are taller and stronger this would not be a problem for you."
2,Get what you pay for...,"Listen, nice umbrella for the price but don't think it's going to last you more than a season. The wood that holds up the cloth is very week. In fact, I had to send the original order back do to the wood breaking during shippping. And wouldn't you know it, the second one's wood broke a couple months later."
4,Market Umbrella,"The umbrella is fine, excellent actually. Unfortunately they sent a color I did not order nor do I believe it was even a color offered.If I hadn't had it shipped to an island so that returning it is more trouble that it's worth, I'd have returned it for the color I actually ordered."
4,Perfect for the price,"Great price for it.won't stand up to high winds when open though, but that's to be expected. Just have to remember to close it before going in for the night."
2,Story Line is Distracting,"The story line is the distracting part of the book. If I wanted to read a fantasy book, I would have bought one. When I want to learn trig, I don't want a book that tries to amuse you with a sideshow, I just want the bare facts laid out in an easy to follow format, which this book does not have. I got bored with dumb story and quit reading the book altogether."
2,couldn't slog through it,"I purchased this book with the intent of teaching myself trigonometry - but after three chapters, I found I couldn't slog through the stupid fantasy story the book's structured around. I mean it, it's godawful, and renders the book entirely unreadable. I'm now going through Peter Selby's _Geometry and Trigonometry for Calculus_, which is far, far more palatable and straightforward."
2,Trigonometry the easy way,"This book was not that helpful to me. I have had trigonometry before and purchased this book as a refresher. There are very few examples throughout the text, which makes it very difficult to solve the exercises at the end of each chapter."
2,fairy tale is distracting,"I got this book a while ago, but I gave up reading it after a few chapters because of the fairy tale that is the story line.I would not recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn or refresh their trigonometry"
4,Fun Entertaining Introduction to Beginning Trigonometry,"Dr. Downing is a good writer and very entertaining. But beware, the content of this book is more appropriate to the trig we teach to high school geometry students. There is little here that would be helpful for our Honors (AP) Trigonometry students except as a highly entertaining way to review, perhaps during the month before school starts, what trigonometry they were supposed to learn in geometry."
2,One more 'No' vote,"Like many other reviewers, I found the attempt to imbed trig into a fairy tale very unamusing at best. The math concepts covered were hard to keep straight, since you had to keep re-reading the crappy story to refresh your memory. I can't imagine that anyone could really learn trig (or anything) with this kind of approach. And the author shouldn't have even attempted to write it...not without some serious background work in creative writing anyway."
1,This book is not recommended...,"Credit has to be given to Downing for the obvious effort, but sorry, no cigar. This book was not very helpful or explanitive, it avoided the advanced topics entirely & introduced the worthless, outdated, difficult, & inefficient concepts first before it introduced the worthy, updated, easy, & efficient concepts. Frankly, the worthless cocepts didn't have to be introduced at all. I wonder if they really will allow me to return this book like it says on the cover..."
1,"NOT the TRUTH! A ""Fairy-Tale""","My name is Taylor Pero, author of ""ALWAYS, LANA"" 1982, Bantam Books paperback. As Miss Turner's personal manager and confidante, Eric Root was introducted to Lana Turner my myself alone. I met him through a gay personals ad shortly after beginning my job for Miss Turner. I have kept all of the love letters and half-naked Poloroid photo he sent in his own hand-writing and would be happy to make them public in order to put an end to what Lana Turner often described as ""his flapping lips"". I can't describe the misinformation contained here and can only say that he used me to get to her and her to climb the ladder. He is a very talented hairdresser, but the kind who gives others of his profession a bad name."
1,Give Me A Break!,"Yeah right. I'm sooo sure Lana Turner secretley confided into her ""friend"" and asked him to ""tell it... tell it all"" AFTER her death. Only so she couldn't SUE him. This book isn't even a guilty pleasure, it's just plain stupid and a waste of time. I believe it to be a bunch of lies because he wants to be a big part of the scandal. No one cares. He's a joke."
5,Real-life Hollywood drama at its best!,I found Mr. Root's book fascinating. I could just hear Lana's high heels clicking along that marble hallway on her way out the door to meet her public! Mr. Root's style is perfect to tell the tale of Hollywood's greatest glamour queen. My only suggestion is that he keep up the good work!
1,Could have been better,"This movie, if you can call it that, is basically a set of music videos with a random plot spliced in. The director was most definitely trying to make this more artistic then say, leave you understanding the pain and misery of being an eternal. Between the ship, the car races, the ""ghost,"" and the forced acting, I'd say, leave this one on the shelf."
4,Olympus 330,This dye sublimation printer gives beautiful prints that give you all the sharpness and resolution that is as good or better than a film camera. I have only used it in printing the memory card with the printer (not hooked up to the computer). The one bothersome thing I have noticed is that it only gives 30 prints per ribbon not 60.
1,the seller sucks,the seller never hade the item he was selling tuck my money i called and was told the item just came in 7 was being shipped after 2 weeks i called the maker and was told this item has bin made in over 10 years
3,IT'S OK,IT'S GOOD AND ALSO IT GIVES GREAT PICTURE BUT THE THINGS IS THE RIBBON THOSE NOT PRINT 60 PICTURE ONLY 30 PIC NOT MORE
1,Don't waste your money!,"The power supply flickered once when I plugged it in and nothing. This is the worst experience I've had with TigerDirect or Amazon. No way to get it replaced or fixed. Please, don't waste your money on products from ADSTech"
1,Never worked!,"The enclosure never worked. Plugged in the HD, made all the connections, closed everything up, plugged in, switched on... and nothing but a blinking power light.ADS Tech support has not responded. I would not recommend this item. This is a discontinued item from ADS Tech and their tech support doesn't seem very responsive anyways, so if you run into a problem you're stuck. For the same price you have other options - pick something else."
4,Works fine,This meets my needs as a backup hard drive and lets me use an old ATA hard drive on my new SATA system
4,Works Good So Far,"I bought this item from Amazon and it seems to be working good. It took me a couple of tries to get my Windows 98 system to recognize it, but when it did, I was able to use it fine. The installation disk may be written for Windows 2000 and XP. I still recommend this product."
2,"workED great, then broke","i just deleted my postive review of this product. i used to be very happy with this drive, until it simply stopped working about 3 months after i bought it. i ended up having to go to compusa and buying another brand.. be warned a bit about long term reliability.."
1,Power Supply Gave Up After One Use,This is garbage. I used it once and then the power supply sorta gave up--it just flickered and couldn't even power the fan. I looked at the manufacturer's website and they have absolutely no troubleshooting or helpful information for this device.The near immediate failure of this unit really put me in a bind. I needed the files on the hard drive to meet a deadline--needless to say I did not meet it.Don't waste your money on anything from this manufacturer.
4,Relaxing music,"A nice collection of calm and relaxing music from various composers . The best, according to my opinion , is "" Cliodhna"" by Gnomusy ."
4,Funny and Insightful,"I would love to hear Ed Rollins opinions concerning the present President Bush. His book descibes the problems with the first Prsident Bush adminastration (such as putting a higher price on staff and administrators with blind loyalty to those who knew what they were doing)Rollins book was very funny and a nice peek at the inside of political campaigns. He was very honest in the way he dealt his stories of former Presidents Nixon and Reagan. he did not try to gloss over the failings of either presidency or try to sugar coat anything. He explained his admiration of both Reagan and Nixon, and making a reasonable explaination for liking Richard Nixon can't be easy in a time when even the Republican party tries to forget him. But Ed Rollins does so in a manner which make sit possible to see that there was another side to the man."
4,Tough as nails,Ed Rollins book is a must read for any political junkie (from the left or right). If you are thinking of running for an office or running a campaign at any level. Rollins' isight into the political back dealings with candidates and candidate spouses alike is unmatched.
4,If Love Politics or Hate Perot Read this Book,"Ed Rollins has written a page turner and insiders view of politics over the last 20 years. His accounts of the campaigns of Reagan '84, Christine Whitman '94, Perot '92, and Michael Huffington's disasterous Senate race show you how this business really works. Almost a political consultants training manual.The best part of the book is about Perot's '92 campaign and Ed should write another book on this guy. The current Reform Party circus could have been predicted during Perot's 92 effort. Essentially Perot is a control freak, an eccentric, shoot-the-messenger, populist crackpot and thank god all he did to the country was cause Bush to lose. Take this to the beach or on a plane and chuckle all the way."
4,Great political gossip,"As a die-hard liberal Democrat, I didn't want to like this four-cassette opus. But Ed Rollins, Republican strategist extraordinaire, really knows how to dish the dirt. I howled over his story about how, as a young GOP ""rising star,"" Rollins went to meet Richard Nixon for the first time. Nixon greeted Rollins, then promptly sauntered into the bathroom to relieve himself - but was ""considerate"" enough to leave the door open so he and Rollins could carry on their conversation uninterrupted. From Tricky Dick to the personal fiefdom of Nancy Reagan over her husband's administration to the penny-wisdom and pound-foolishness of Ross Perot, this audiotape will keep your headphones on till the end of Side 8"
3,An over-wordy look at the underside of politics.,"Rollins has gotten plaudits for his ""self-honesty."" The effect of all this honesty however is to recount the Rollins version.But in large sections, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Rollins's Perot days DO take some explaining, and Rollins explains away with gusto -- entertaining gusto.The book could have used an editorial tightening-up; stuff spoken into a tape recorder usually does fail to make the cut as literature.If you want to see various Republicans (the Huffingtons, for example) and crypto-Republicans (e.g., Ross Perot) skewered with self-justifying glee, Rollins is you man and this is your book.For politics junkies (DO YOU WATCH C-SPAN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY?) and Republicans who want to get red-in-the-face furious."
2,Poor design,"I was very excited to get this oriole feeder as I saw the same one at Wildbirds Unlimited. I figured it must be good if they sell it. Well, it is the worse feeder I have purchased. I agree with the other reviews that it's a bee trap. I hung it on the branch along with my other feeders and the birds never went to it. It did attract bees, flies and assorted other flying insects. I think the feeding holes are too large allowing the insect to get to the nectar. It's too bad it didn't have some sort of plastic inserts to keep the insects out. Oh, and the trap on the top to keep out the ants, didn't happen."
4,Showing manly man,"A next story of potential migrants whose intentions wouldn't amuse at all as Senegal depicted testifies in this case.A pare of pro-western-looking young people stole whatever to make it in Paris.Well, if they drive own motor-bike and a car, no wonder they will nothing to do in a French semi-colony.Humor and a natural actors' beauty add a very something to this work interesting for depicting a place so rarely screened wherever."
1,A plot as thin as the book,"I've been a fan of some of Coulter's novels for quite some time, but this book belongs collecting dust in the bargain bin. The plot is gossamer and the character development non-existent. Not to mention the loose ends and unexplained happenings that are never wound up at the end. How did this ever make it to publishing?"
5,"Swim Polar Bear, Swim",This is a great book for children and for adults. It is a story of a mother's love for her child. Highly recommend.
3,Good introduction - a bit dated,"This is a great little book for self study and a springboard for further study. A lot of these Dover publications are a bit dated and sometimes not the most clearly written and this is no exception. (In their defense, though, they are often seminal works written by the actual practitioners in the field.) Still, though, the writer is fairly nontechnical and introduces the major concepts of probability in a thorough manner. He delves a bit into statistics and ends up with a chapter on gaming. Take the concepts of this book, throw in a little more stats and logic and you've got a good Spock in the making."
4,"Tire levers work fine, but have not tried the patch","I used the tire levers and well, they work as they should! Not much else to say, they seem rugged and they fit together. I usually carry only two, don't really see the need for three, so I have a spare. Thankfully I have not had to use the patches, but in reading other websites it seems they perform best with low pressures such as with mountain bikes, so hopefully they will work when needed. If you have a road bike, you might be better off going with a glue patch kit and maybe buy the levers separately (they are usually 1 dollar at local bike stores)"
4,Acessorios buenos,"el Park Tool TR-1 Tire and Tube Repair Kit es un kit basico para los despiches, buen precio para lo que dan, buenos acabados."
5,Park Tool TR-1 Repair Kit,"Pros:- Small- Over 100 PSI- 6 Pre-Glued Patches- Comes with 3 Stackable Tire LeversCons:- Tire Levers don't hold up well against Roadbike TiresThoughts:You're going to have a hard time with roadbike tires using the plastic tire levers. They are a good width and are stiff but not sharp. Don't use the hook end and take it slow. The patches are great. They are pretreated so you don't have to mix anything. Just clean, abraid, and then apply. They hold up against 100+ PSI. The patches are small and so is the case. A small patch of sandpaper is included. The case is about the size of 2 Mini SD cards stacked on top of each other. The patches can be purchased separately without the tire levers as well. I'm riding on a Scott Speedster S60 with Michelin Airstop Butyl tubes and Continental Gators tires and they have withstood 250+ miles.Bottom Line:Highly Recommended!"
3,works,"The repair kit works and the patch is okay, but as the other reviews state the patch only work for few weeks at most and then you need a new tube"
4,Trusted Name.,Levers:Good quality. simple. Does the job.I only use patches as last resort for short term fix on 500 plus mile rides where two tubes didn't get me to the end.
4,One of the best levers out there,"Like most cyclists, I have owned all types of tire levers. Some come free with certain purchases or repair kits, some you buy because you lose the Park lever you had. Well, don't bother with the others! They're junk! Not that they break, but they don't seem to get the proper leverage between rim and tire. This goes for road bikes anyway. The patches are okay. No better or worse than any other I've used."
1,Poor quality,The levers broke with the first use on my Trek. I logged 2000 road miles this year and the first time I had a flat I was left on the side of the road waiting for a ride because of the poor quality of the tools. Save yourself the headache when you need the equipment and purchase a set of metal levers. You want the tool to do the job when it counts!
4,nice repair kit,"I am happy with this repair kit, I hope that I do not have to use it often but it should do the job. I have been very pleased with the Park Brand for bike stuff."
1,HORRIBLE!,This sucks! Plain & simple! I would go for another tool! The only reason I did not make a fuss about it is simply it is not worth the hassle at all!
5,It works,"I have not used the patches yet, but the levers work really well. I was replacing my tubes and tires, this was a back up plan. I thought I would go ahead and use the levers to mount the tires and am really glad I did, they really made the job much easier."
4,"Cheap Product, Worked Well",I used this for my bike last week. It was cheap and worked well. No complaints here! I would recommend it
5,mark #2,Every cyclist should carry a set of levers. Park tool always makes dependable stuff. Good price and fast shipping. Get a set for every bike!
3,great,the perfect tool to remove tires from their rims very easy to use and it works very fast thank you for this tool is comes in handy .
2,Show and Tell!,"I ended up buying this book, to find out more on Dennis Rodman and his eccentric life-style, since it is a difficult road he has chosen. Being different and not following the herd it tends to be lonely. I do admire him for that! This book begins at full speed, an interesting story, but when you get to about half way, you notice the repetition of the quotes and basketball stories. Sorry, but I had a bit of trouble finishing the book, but eventually it did end and I was glad, because the story has a U-turn to boring!"
2,Cry me a river!,"I like Dennis Rodman the basketball player, but not the author. I borrowed the book, thank goodness for that foresite. I enjoyed about a third of the book. Then I noticed that he was continually repeating himself. repeating himself. And when he did - it sounded like whinning. I took this as long as possible. After fighting my way past the middle of the book I gave up. I couldn't take it any more. I had to quit. Sorry, Dennis. Yes, your a great basketball player, but get someone else to help you write. That book could have saved a lot of paper, if it had been half as long."
5,Cool book! My brother lost it but I still have the cover.,"Hey people this is a great book if you want to hear about bad words, sex, stealing, what the NBA is REALLY like, Madonna, having sex with Madonnna, getting all the chics you want, rock-and-roll, sex, ... did I say Madonna?I had the book but my brother lost it."
3,easy read,"Well this is a so-so book. The Worm is an interesting character and makes the book worth flipping through. However, there are times where you may wonder if his life and his emotions are as fake as his hair. I'd recommend this to Rodman fans or Rodman haters but no one else"
3,As a Biography it's not bad at all.,"I have no clue who Dennis Rodman was before I read the book. I mean, I did, but not really. I'm not a fan of Basketball and I was only reading the book because my bother bought it. I must say I enjoyed it. It's well written and Dennis's life story has some interesting bits in it. I'm sure NBA fans will enjoy it even more."
3,To be or not to be...,"He's definitely struggled to get to where he is now, I admire him for his individuality and strength, which most people don't have the courage, to do most things he does. It's probably good that not all of us is doing what he does, but to follow a personal dream, is quite a quest. I give 3 stars, because Dennis repeats himself plenty of times during the book, which makes it tiring to read."
4,"Extremely interesting, personal and real","Bad As I Wanna Be is honest and straightup. It's as if Rodmanis having a conversation with you as he explains the reasonsbehind the things he has been castigated for as well as thethings that constantly fascinate the public. In fact, onewould like to have told Rodman that he didn't have to discussso much because it seems like he is trying to justify himselfto those who insist on chastising him at his every turn.Rodman gives unabashed and sometimes funny opinions andobservations on life experiences and those who have crossedhis path. You may not agree with everything he says but yougotta respect someone who is free and lives by no one else'srules but his own."
1,Run for the hills!,Isn't it against the law to write books this terrible? After reading this I can honestly saw that my opinion of him has taken a nose dive. Lets keep him on the court and away from pen & paper.
2,Repetitive as I Wanna Be,"I found this book disappointing. I was expecting something resembling an autobiography of Dennis' life, with plenty of tales from experience. While there were a few such stories, much of the book could be described as a rant, with Dennis harping on about the same old stuff again and again.He hated the Spurs' coach, he's never been paid what he's worth, David Robinson is crap, he's a good rebounder, he was in two championship teams, he misses his daughter, he boinked Madonna, he's misunderstood, he had a tough upbrining.I mean, fair enough that this may all be be true...but do we REALLY need to hear about it over and over and over?? Even in the chapter about sex, which you would expect to have something a little risque in it, Dennis manages to mention his rebounding average AGAIN.If I took all the insights Dennis gave us and cut out all the repitition, this book would be about 20 pages long."
3,It has ceased to be relevant,"Dennis Rodman was a fascinating bad boy who wasn't afraid of mouthing off about anyone. His book is full of a very few good stories and plenty of complaints about fellow players, basketball management, coaches, everyone. He's bitter and angry, not full of interesting anecdotes. Most of this has ceased to be relevant as his heyday of shock value has passed. For someone not intimately involved in the mid to late 1990's basketball scene, none of the information retains relevancy as time passes. This might be good as a history book for a true fan, but if you lived through the Rodman heyday, you probably picked up his memoir back then.So much is done for pure shock value, and it gets tiresome."
5,Very fun read,"Dennis is a very likable, respectable guy and you learn it early on in the book. its never boring and he doesn't necessarily have to be as famous as he is for this autobio to be enjoyable. it's a good book"
1,Used copies still at $.01,Used copies are still up to a penny? I've been waiting years for resellers to finally pay me to read this book. I guess I'll have to keep waiting.
4,"Outstanding, challenging; a masterpiece","An outstanding book by a man widely known as a freak. I really enjoyed reading this book and i can say that my liking of this book has nothing to do with my admiration for Dennis Rodman. I think he has nothing to hide and that's what makes him a true character.The reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because some of the parts are a bit ""against the rules"", too open, too careless. Other than that it's an excellent book and i reccomend it to those people who think Rodman is a freak who wants attention."
2,"""Too much publicity for Dennis Rodman""","Don't waste your time on this book. Nothing but ""stories"" about a man who wants attention, needs attention, but doesn't deserve attention."
5,It was a great book! It told all about Dennis rodmans Life.,This book was one of the best books I have ever read! It was great I loved how he expressed his feelings to everyone! A Great book and a sure recomendation to adults. The language and content is very rough. Amazon.com is great!!!
3,Pictorial,Pictures are nice. Not quite what I expected. More a pictorial covering all areas of the state with only a little written information. Not for planning travel.
2,Disappointed,"The book is informative & I expected it to be, but the writing quality is very disappointing, it's a bunch of incongruent phrases thrown together. I'm not sure to blame the writer or the editor. If it wasn't for the pictures, my fiancee and I wouldn't probably continue with it. There's so many ways to improve this book it's sad that it hasn't been done."
1,Nothing new under the covers...,"This book is merely a device for Mr Comfort's personal preferences. Armpit hair, personal odors etc. He also uses French phrases freely with no explanation of what they mean. This book seems to give permission to have and enjoy sex to readers who are well beyond the 'is it ok to...?"" stage. Not sensual, not a turn on or inspirational. Even though the drawins are well done, they seem almost clinical as does the information."
5,Great for my V-twin,This was a must have for working on my motorcycle. There are many spots that were impossible to reach with a standard length allen wrench.
5,Lauren Brookes Great Book,This is a great book. It is about Tybalt an abused horse and how Malory tries to make him into a good show jumper. Mrs. Carmichal though only will give Malory a limited time though to let Tybalt show his skill using the T-Touch(Amy Fleming's technique). You should really read this book because it is a fantastic book of horses and of Chestnut Hill
5,Gordon is a lot of fun!!!!!,My little one absolutely loves Gordon!!!! We had looked in every store near our home to find him before ordering him on Amazon.
4,Gordon!,"Gordon is on many Thomas episodes and is important enough to be in the theme song (""Gordon thunders down the line""), so he is a must for any Thomas wooden railway set!"
3,A Thomas & Friends must; but too pricey,"I was a railway fanatic when I was a little child; and now my son is, too, and probably more so than I ever was, thanks to the art and science of modern marketing. He wants Thomas this and Thomas that. He loves Gordon -- I guess most kids love Gordon because he's big and powerful. This hardwood toy looks nice, but doesn't seem very durable -- my son dropped it once and the wheel bases got really loose, to the point that we may need to buy another one. Also, these toys are made in China, and the trees they cut down to make these are from China, too, so I guess the cost to manufacture is probably 50 cents, but they charge U.S. consumers twenty bucks. Makes me wish I were in the toys trade."
5,My son just loves these toys,"My son has become an absolute Thomas the Tank Engine Fanatic. He sleeps with his favorites and cannot get enough play time with them. He loves the computer game and also watches the videos. He has to have stories read to him from the complete Thomas book before he can go to sleep. And why not. The cars are durable, they teach motor skills and their fun for both of us."
5,Perfect,"This huge toy is loved by many; you can roll it around, make a train, play games, and lots of other stuff with it.Also, it is very durable.This toy is great!"
1,Not Suitable at All,"This is not a children's book at all. The pictures could be upseting, there is not story behind it, the language is not what you want your kids to learn at an early age or ever! I have never read this author before, but I will certainly won't do it after this book. I am glad I did not buy it, my son picked it out at the library misled by the front picture."
5,It is too for kids!,"My husband and I have been Pratchett fans for years, and never thought we'd be able to share a Pratchett book with our two-year old daughter for many more years. Hah! She loves this book. We have to read it twice before she goes to bed, and if we try to substitute something else, she says firmly, ""Cow! Cow!""This is an honest testimonial - give your kids a chance to enjoy this book!"
4,Not for kids? Nonsense,"I think some of the reviewers who didn't think this was a good child's book probably didn't actually read it to a child. My granddaughter (4) wanted it read over and over. The picture of the ""scary"" troll was a perfect chance to explain that not everyone who looks scary is a bad guy, that troll is Sgt. Detritus who is a very good guy. After I told her that, she explained it to her cousin, her father, and one of my dogs.It is true that there is more going on than what a small child sees. But the child does see a Daddy reading a story to his little boy and loves the pictures and the silliness, and the adult can enjoy Sam Vimes attempt to make the ""book within a book"" more appropriate for a city boy and can appreciate that none of it matters. That what matters is that Sam Vimes, whose life is so incredibly busy that he seldom gets enought to eat or sleep, comes home every night at six, and reads ""Where's My Cow?"" to his son."
4,A Fun Book For Serious Discworld Fans,"And children might like it too.But only for those two groups, really."
5,Love this book,"I love this book. Love the idea, the story and characters. The illustrations are amazing and I'm planning on reading it to my granddaughter."
3,Nice book but not much value for the buck,"I like Pratchett's novels and could easily imagine that he would be a good kid's book writer. And he is but unfortunately there is not a lot of it in this one. Nice graphics, amusing story (the kids love it) but much too short."
3,Not quite the book I thought it was,"I kind of thought this book would be more like the fictional book ""Where's my Cow?"" described in ""Nightwatch"", instead it is a mix of that and the book Sam Vimes thought it should be.The difference is that the first would be enjoyed by the child, the other would be more enjoyed by a fan of Terry pratchett who is reading to a child."
4,Good humor for Discworld lovers,"As anyone interested in Discworld's Watchmen series knows, young Sam's favorite picture book is a much-chewed and loved tome with the title Where's My Cow? This delightful book allows everyone to share in Sam's glee, especially since the second half is the Vimes/Ankh-Morpork version, highlighting familiar characters and their trademark catchphrases. This is not a book for someone venturing into Discworld, including the traditional audience for picture books; the jokes are best appreciated by seasoned veterans. Definitely a perfect gift for the Ankh-Morpork fantatic!"
1,not a children's book,"Bugger, I should have read the reviews. I thought it was the Where's my Cow book that Vimes reads to his son but nooooo.... I wouldn't have minded that if the illustrations weren't so bad. Not gross as someone else said but just bad art. Poorly done in photoshop or something."
5,Where's My Cow? There's My Cow!,"This is a really cute book. Sam Vimes reads to Young Sam promptly at 6 pm, come h**l or high water. As they go through the book, both Sam's become exceedingly silly and have great fun until Sybil comes up to see what the commotion is all about. This book is yet another insight into the Discworld and shows that there is a kid in all of us looking for an occasional escape. Great fun, this!"
5,Terry Pratchett's inside joke,"Not too long ago, one of my sisters was visiting my home and asked for a book to read to her children at bedtime. Where's My Cow? is the book she ended up with, and she later told me that her children thought it was the strangest book they had ever read. For someone that's never read any of Terry's Discworld novels, this book will make very little sense. But for those of us who know and love Sam Vimes, it's a private joke between friends."
5,my kids' favorite book ever,"My husband and I love Terry Pratchett's books and bought this book when our firstborn was a tiny baby, more for us than for our kids. We never thought we'd try reading it to our kids more than once, never thought they'd like it. Our son is now 3 and we have a 2 year old daughter as well, and it has been hands-down their favorite book! We have an entire bookcase filled with children's books, but this book is literally the only one that has tape on every page and is slowly falling to pieces because it is so well-loved and used! I bought brand new copies for my son and daughter, and a third copy for the baby on the way who I expect will probably love it as much as her siblings do, so that someday they can each have a nice copy to read to their own children."
3,A Collection and child Book,"""Where is my cow"" is an illustrated book for very small Children (2-3 years old?). And it is a collection book for Terry Pratchett Fans. If you have kids and want to introduce them to T.P and reading, this book is sweet and can be used to share time together. If you collect pratchett books this will be a simple object for your library. Cant say it's not ok, simply depends on what you are looking for. It's a child book or a collection Object, nothing more, nothing less. Even if i do possess much more interesting Pratchett Collection things."
2,"Probably nice, if I could read it...","My son loves animals so I was looking for something like the WildLife Fact File - info on each animal, where it lives, what it eats, how long it lives, etc. He loves learning that stuff. This book is large, but I couldn't read it - I swear the font is 8pt at most! Incredibly small. Paperpack binding is not sufficient to pack all of this information in.Would have rather paid twice the price for two books in ring binding in a readable font.Also, no Bonobos? Really? Jam packed with animals and no Bonobos. ??"
2,Not like rainforest,Lots of reading and small pics throughout. Interesting but wish was more like Rainforest.
5,Worth More Than 5 Stars,"This book is worth more than 5 stars. I purchased this book as a Christmas present, for myself. I have yet to put in down or allow anyone to put there grubby little/big hands on it. Anyone interested or in love with animals, will enjoy this book. The pages and chapters are color coded for easy access, which make it great. Buy this book with the pleasure of knowing that it will help and relax you, everytime you pick it up."
5,Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife,"this book is very informative, excellent pictures and animal descriptions.I'm looking for the same book, but, just on reptiles. Defanatly an A+"
4,Great reference guide for the price.,"Overall a great valve for the money. Pictures are clear and all in color. Explaines well the breakdown of species. For a book at this price it cannot be beat, but there are some items that I think should have been included. The first is the average life span of the species. It's mentioned for very few animals but it always facinates me to realize how long or short some of these animals live for. Another puzzling exclusion from the book is that humans are not included ... unless humans are not considered part of the Animal Kingdom. Puzzling choice not to include humans."
5,BEAUTIFUL BOOK,I am very pleased with this book. It is very informative and introduces you to a wide range of species. Gorgeous photos and easy to read. This would be a great gift for someone who is just beginning to explore the animal world as well as someone who just wants a beautiful text on animals.
4,Doris Day,She sings like an angel. Although I was very young when she was still making movies I remembered her velvet sound. Now I am introducing her to my children and grandchildren
3,Doris Day,"I found the CD to be in good condition from the vendor. It contains some of the same songs that are available on Doris Day's Greatest Hits, as well as additional ones. I enjoyed this collection."
4,Oregon Scientific Ultra Cold Temp/ Humidity Sensor,Item does well. Bought lithium batteries as suggested. Unit does not come with mounting saddle as previous sensors I owned. Found it more difficult to mount. Previous sensors had readout of temperature on the unit. Miss that on this unit. Unit indicates humidity while most weather reports now provide the dew point so it is a little more difficult to determine its accuracy.
5,Great remote working with my John Deer Thermometer,"I have the John Deer thermometer in the house, one remote in the garage, and I've placed this third one in my chicken coop to tell me when I need to turn on the heat or winterize. It works great, no problems with it staying in sync and batteries seem to last quite some time. If I have another place to put one I will."
3,"slow burning film,poster looks better","another hard film to find,is on a ntsc vhs tape in the states or dvd-r copies from private collectors,but don`t try too much to get it as poster is promising more than film delivers,just seen this last night and should have been much better,anything with Sidney Poitier in it is worth a look,but this is very slow and way too talkie,feels like an episode of ironside or any cop series from the sixties,idea of blacks knocking off a local companies payrol sounds good,but the bits inbetween way the movie down and ending takes a little to believe,may get a proper release but will not be high on any dvd firms releasing schedule,or your wish list."
5,little speedy,This charger works like a charm. I realize my old one hadgotten a little slow but this one is like lightening.I love it!
3,"Cordola is great, this recording isn't","If you like brilliant electric guitar and want to check out Lanny Cordola, run do not walk over to the reviews of ""Electric Warrior Acoustic Saint,"" also by Cordola. THAT recording is a masterpiece of rock guitar inventiveness; THIS recording had such potential but poor production. Three stars just because it's Lanny Cordola, but buy the other CD."
2,Not a great Thomas toy,"We love all of our Thomas wooden trains, but Terrence was a letdown. His special caterpillar treads are the thing that make him desirable, but they come off very easily and he doesn't move so well (especially on carpet) when he's got them on. My son was three when we got Terrence and although for a child that age he was fairly good at small motor tasks, he couldn't get the treads back on by himself. I spent a lot of time fussing with them. We eventually threw the treads away (about the time our baby learned to crawl--they seemed like a choking hazard) and we use Terrence without them now. While he works fine with regular wheels, the ""point"" of Terrence is his caterpillars. I was disappointed in this toy."
1,Treads come off all to easy!,"I purchased this for my 3 year old son and no sooner than we had taken him out of the box and ran it on the table the treads came off. I am constantly looking for the treads, or fixing them. All the other Thomas toys we have are great, but Terrance doesn't seem as durable as the others, thus making this toy in my opinion a flop."
3,New Design,"Well when we purchased this toy we had read the reviews here and expected the treads to come off all the time. Well, lo and behold our version of terence doesn't do this. They've redesigned him and the treads do not come off. He fits on the track but does not roll like the other trains. Pressure has to be applied and his wheels will turn but he can in no way roll down a hill on his own. You could cut the treads but the wheels don't appear to be the right size. Sometimes the treads get off their wheel grooves a bit and they seem like they may stretch out. Our son still loves ""Terdence"" but I would almost prefer having the old style so we could remove the treads and he would roll freely. Messes up the track too if it's not secure. The store had both versions I now know and may buy the other one. Difficult to make everyone happy I realize, Dad probably is more concerned about it than his son :)"
4,"Good toy, but beware of tread",Generally this Tomas & Friends toy is of similar quality as the rest of the line. However within the first 10 minutes of opening the toy the plastic tractor tread that it rolls on had twisted. Its not a hard fix for an adult but a child may find it frustrating. This is still a great toy just beware if buying for a younger child this could become an issue.
4,terence the tractor,"My son was very happy to find him on his Thomas birthday cake after a year long wait. He washed nicely from the frosting. We haven't had him long now, but the caterpillars have only slipped off once, which from other reviews I know was a problem with older versions, but they easily slipped back on. So far so good."
3,Not as good as the trains,"My son loves all the Thomas toys, but I have to agree with other reviewers that this one was a bit of a letdown. The rubber treads make it almost impossible to play with, so we cut them off almost immediately. Now my son can enjoy it, but having to remove the treads kind of defeats the purpose of buying a tractor."
2,SLOW SHIPPING,"This item looks ok, but the website was COMPLETELY misleading in saying that it ships within 24 hours. I ordered this on Nov. 27th and did not receive it til Dec. 8th. That's nearly 2 weeks. It may not be worth ordering online even with the free shipping, better to fight the crowds at the stores."
5,Great Deal!,Great product for a great price! Highly impressed. Very heavy duty glassware. Will definitely buy this manufacturer's product again!!
1,It explodes!!!,of course if you read the bottom it says not for stove top use...but...I decided to use it for minimal use in boiling some eggs. I set the eggs in water in the anchor bowl...set the heat on high .. and covered it with a heat resistent plate. When it started to bowl..I removed the plate...and BOOM!!!!...the entire bowl blew up!!!...Glass and hot water everywhere!..I don't mind if you have a disclaimer about not using it on the stove top..but...DANGER! It Blows up! is a little bit different than the statement...'For microwave and oven use only'...doug
1,Figure Skating -,"I was disappointed in the book because I wanted it for a new young figure sakter, and I was anticipating more pictures -- this book is very technical and for older skaters."
1,don't buy - can't register it!,"The company is no longer making this software and are not offering ANY product support. Unfortunately, you WILL NOT be able to completely run the software without registering it. :/"
1,Not what I thought it was,I bought this product to edit (mainly) MPEG-II and Real Media files. It does neither.
3,o.k,"Not impressed.. If this is suppost to be a romance novel it bombed. A fun story, and thats about it. If you are wanting or hoping for a romance you will only find love from a distance and one moment of passion. I would call this a cute story."
1,Grim stuff,"This is really grim stuff; just a bunch of articles contributed by advertisers telling us how wonderful their products are. If you want to read some real editorial on this subject you'd be much better off looking at Hydrocarbon Processing or, better still, Petroleum Technology Quarterly."
4,Frank Kelly's Vision,"Too often the political process is something that takes place far outside our own lives, which is why voters tend to be either emotional partisans of their celebrity heroes or apathetic or cynical. Frank Kelly's understanding of one very human and accessible man, Harry Truman, made me rethink what the American Presidency is about. By interweaving his own lifestory with the Truman presidency, Kelly creates an absorbing drama into which we are all swept. He sees politics not as a game, but as the means to realizing a nation's highest potential. Yes, he is an idealist, but we have too few of those. Kelly's vision of one president and his world-changing decisions is transferable to every presidency. As we prepare to elect a new man to that office, there's no more appropriate reading for us than Kelly's book."
4,Another Happy Ending...Local Boys Go National !!!!!,"Many things change over a period of time, but for the last 15 years one thing has been consistent- The Clarks ! With the release of the newest CD ""Another Happy Ending""- Pittsburgh's BEST kept secret will be a secret no longer ! From the reflections of September 11th in ""Hey You"" to the tongue in cheek bad relationship in ""This Old House Is Burning Down Tonight""- The Clarks and producer Justin Niebank reach a new level in modern rock 'n roll ! If you've heard and enjoy The Clarks, you'll want to buy this CD- If you've NEVER heard of The Clarks, you'll NEED to buy this CD !"
4,They've done it again!,"This newest CD from the Clarks seems to be their most laid back, but definitely does not disappoint. It includes an all new dose of what they do best, heart-felt lyrics, catchy rhymes, and amazing guitar work. They sneak in a little funk at the end of ""On Saturday"", and get you in a dancing mood with ""Boys Lie"". They have managed to put together yet another CD that you just can't stop listening to."
5,Saving Rock N Roll,"Its been a long time since I've found a band so refreshing. The Clarks have developed a smoke-filled bar sound that only a working class city like Pittsburgh could foster. This is garage rock at its best. Having caught several live performances in the past year this band has made listening to live rock fun again. Masters of the ""love gone sour"" song, tunes like ""This Old House"" and ""On Saturday"" will leave you with a smile no matter how bad your love life is. Singer Scott Blasey has tons of lead personality and Guitarist Rob James' riffs will leave your toes tapping. If you are bored with the state of rock n roll, look no farther, this is how the founding fathers intended it to be."
5,totally from the heart!,i've known carole since grade school & she always carried her guitar! it shows beautiful music. A voice that goes to your soul!!! :) nice job carole!!! jim
5,The galapagos Affair,"love this book, true story and well-researched , anyone who has been to the Galapagos or is planning to go should definitely read this book"
5,Anthems!!!!!!!!!,"This Album is one of the best album in grunge history,although it's so underrated...sad...But when you listen to this disc from the opening track Shadow of the season to the last track on the disc,You'll feel so complete..when your in love listen to this album,when your soul searching listen to this album...and if you broke up with someone listen to this album specially the song Dollar Bill..and everything flows..PLEASE GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK!!!!!!BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!nuff'said................"
5,"Please don't use the ""G"" word!","Grunge (the only time you'll see that word for the rest of this review). This a classic rock album. Absolutely no filler on this album, every song is bursting with energy and emotion. The sound is a nice blend of hard rock and 70's era psychedelica with very soothing (bluesy?)vocals. Recommeded if you like: Mountain, Skynard, Meat Puppets, Stones, early Aerosmith, Deep Purple, Pearl Jam."
4,Screaming Trees Sweet Oblivion,This album brings back some old memories. Songs are still awesome and how they did not become more widely known goes beyond me. The quality of sound is excellent. All the songs are great and there was one sing on this album I didn't expect so that was a bonus. If you liked or still like indie or grunge rock than this is an album you want.
5,One of the all time greats,"This is one of the only cd's I have ever heard that I can listen to straight through and enjoy every single moment of it. There is not one bad song on this album, and they all flow beautifully into each other. This is a true classic."
5,WHAT CAN I SAY!!!!!,ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER CREATED. ALONG WITH DUST THEIR SECOND ALBUM; THIS IS TRUELY ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME. MUICALLY? GENIUS. MARK IS A FENOMINAL VOCALIST WITH HAUNTING VOCAL MELODIES AND A BAND THAT CREATES OUTSTANDING GROOVES TO BACK IT UP. SIMPLY AMAZING!
3,Hmmmm...,"I bought this CD cause of all the praise. I'm disappointed. It's kind of bland and I can see why these guys didn't achieve superstardom. I haven't found a song on it yet with any real hook, so they come off as your average also-ran group. The first two songs are merely Ok, and after that it gets less and less interesting. Definitely recommend you borrow the CD from someone before you buy."
2,you know-im gonna be brutally honest,"so screaming trees-the forgotten grunge band in the era drenched with bands going big in the genre.i had never heard anything by them and bought the cd on a whim.i popped it in the cd player and i mean-i was expecting the same intensity and perfection as ""in utero"" or ""dirt"".what i got was a slow,sludgy,ballady,somewhat bland and pretty uninspiring to me.go ahead and rip me.i tried and tried to dig the album but it just hasnt struck me yet.it just doesnt get me excited about grunge such as albums like ""ten"",""superunknown"",or ""stardog champion"" did.ill give it another try one day,but for now it will just go into the heap of forgotten grunge cds that i have owned and passed over."
4,Bayonet saw carpentry,This is a quality blade for coarse wood cutting. The blade stays sharp for a very long time if you are using quality lumber. This blade does a pretty good job of scrolling if you don't try to make too sharp of corners.
3,Adrenaline Rush? Not So!,"Now I am a big wrestling fan and I watch as much as I can! But what I really love is the music that they play. But Tna released 3rd Degree Burns, I was extremely disappointed.The CD contains 22 tracks, which is a decent amount of music compared to WWE. But the problem is there are about eight tracks on the CD that are worthy of even being called good! The good thing was that they had the song Adrenaline Rush, which is probably the most played song on the CD for me and everyone else who bought it. It is that poor of a CD. Heck you can't even get it on iTunes; that's how bad it is!If you are looking for a great wrestling CD, look somewhere else, but if you really want to listen to the music of TNA either watch the show and listen or find someone who has the CD already and have it burned, but don't but it.TNA Wrestling: 3rd Degree Burns gets 3 stars out of 5.My name is Amone. Adios!"
2,broke away and was lost,"I know these break away collars are considered safer, but cats know how to rub them off and ditch them."
5,A Great Way To Listen To The Internet On Your Stereo,Hooked Matrix up to my stereo (about 30 feet away) and can transmit internet radio from my PC to stereo and listen to it thoughout the house. Works great!!
4,blades,My husband relies on Porter Cable products for their performance but not many blades can be found in retail stores. Very happy to find a source with quick delivery and reasonable pricing.
1,Don't Buy!,"Purchased these clippers from Amazon and was really disappointed in them! Read instructions and let battery charge fully etc before using for the first time and guess what? They couldn't cut through my animals hair! The animal had been bathed and was totally dry and had fine hair! After trying to use them for about 15 minutes the battery died. This is the worst clipper I've ever used. Even the Turbo A-5 was better than this, at least it cuts through hair before burning you!"
1,Be sure to buy the charger also!,I returned this product as quickly as possible as soon as I found that it did not come with a charger. The package was also opened and not packed properly so I'm not sure if the item even worked.I have since purchased this item (with a charger and an extra battery pack) at another site and I'm very happy with it.
3,"If you don't see rainbows, this is for you!","Overall this set is pretty good. If you can see the rainbow effect, forget about it though. This is the only reason I am returning this set. Geometry is okay, better than CRT, not as good as LCD. You might need this set adjusted by a technician. The colors were not quite correct out of the box. Yellow looked green, red looked purple. If you watch PIP, this set could be annoying for you. When you exit PIP, the screen goes to Widescreen mode. You'll then have cycle through all the modes. Also, there is some kind of copy protection in the TV. I tried to watch a show I taped on NBC, when I played it back there were green and red bars across the screen. You can always return it if you don't like it."
1,color wheel problems,These tvs look great but are seriously defective. You can count on the TV breaking within 3-4 years. The color wheels will break and it's an expensive repair > $500. The lamp will also go in a couple of years for another repair.
5,"answer to question, January 13, 2004 -","> How can this be a 43"" TV if it's only 40.5"" wide?Dude you call yourself an electronics fan from carver, ma ...ALL TV sizes are based on their diagonal display size. Therefore you must measure the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the length and width (think back to geometry). In this case the dimensions don't help because they are of the television itself and not the screen, but you get a rough value of 50.22 so a 43 inch diag would definitely fit in that puppy."
1,question,"Features:43-inch widescreen projection HDTV with Digital Micromirror Device; 40.5 x 29.7 x 15.7 inches (W x H x D)How can this be a 43"" TV if it's only 40.5"" wide?"
1,Fluval Canister Filter 305,"This is are 3rd. Fluval, it does not work correctly.We will never buy this product on line again. Our old Fluval does a better job. It's like they sold us a broken product. Diana"
3,Salt,If you are going to do a saltwater setup NO!!! Get a sump. I have this filter on my 60 and its a nitrate trap. Have to clean every DAY!!! Its a headache
1,Returned it,"I purchased this from my LFS for quite a bit more than what is shown here, so price wise, this is a good deal. But the priming is near impossible. It took forever for my son and I got get it to work the first time. I had this thing running just over a month, any power glitch and it would not restart. It wouldn't clean the tank, so I kept cleaning the filters and each time, I had to drain the pump halfway and 'open the floodgates' for it to start. when it started stopping without power interruption, that was the last stratw. My LFS took it back which I am thankful. I will never buy another Fluval anything again."
2,Filter bottom leaking like a tap,"After spending nearly 30 minutes, I was able to set-up the filter for my tank and after i started to prime the pump and then plugged in the canister, surprise surprise, it started to leak profusely, not from the lid or the lid seal, but from the bottom right corner, there might be airline crack in the filter bottom. Thanks to Amazon, I am getting a replacement, hopefully this replacement will work. But this issue looks like a manufacturing defect in the plastic molding.Thanks to this filter, now I have to spend time to dry the carpet. What the heck :-(Buyers beware, before installing , make sure that, it does not leak from the canister tank."
4,Great saw but...,"Would have given the highest rating, but expected a blade with the saw as was pictured. Luckily,I purchased additional blades the same time I ordered the saw. Hubby was very happy with this Christmas gift!"
5,Smells Divine!!,"My boss brought me in some of this after his wife's business closed. It smells divine! Keeps your hands soft & the scent stays for quite awhile. He spoiled me on it, now it's stocked in the kitchen at all times."
5,spoil yourself,"I love this product. I keep them in the bathroom and by the kitchen sink. Its a good hand lotion, a little expensive, but worth the extra money."
5,Lots of fun...,"My two sons age 4 and 2 love all of the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends trains. Edward has such a lovely personality in the stories that he was a must for our collection. He is a kind engine and the boys use him in their pretend play to help the engines get along. The trains have helped my boys learn their colors and numbers as well as alot about trains. Another wonderful thing about the learning curve trains is that if you break one, or it just gets really chipped up they will repair or replace it, and they are so nice to deal with.stephanie, homeschooling mom to 3."
4,Love the toy....don't like the seller,I got this train with two others and i am very disappointed with the one i got....i looked like it ad been used for many years and the little tender car that was suppose to come with it was MIA....when i ordered i expcected the train to be complete but only got half....don't order from the Learning Curve
5,Edward the Blue Engine,My son absolutely adores all his Thomas the Tank Engine stuff. What can I say? Edward the Blue Engine is a fine addition to any child's collection.
5,Great Product,My 3 year old godson loved it. I did confuse it with Thomas the train which he cleared up for me.
5,thomas train,"Small, but durable and my 3 yr old nephew loved it. Ideal to buy more cars and a track for the train to go on."
5,My son was thrilled!,"We have been looking for a wooden Edward for quite some time. ""Santa"" found him on Amazon and my son is so thrilled to have him. As with all wooden Thomas the Tank Engine merchandise, Edward is well made. No complaints."
2,don't buy this,"I recently bought this cd because I liked some of what I heard on the 30 second clips, and it got mostly good reviews. Luckily, I bought it used, so I didn't waste too much of my money. It wasn't totally bad, at least it was listenable, but unless you love average pop/piano bands that try to be punk (at least from their lyrics) don't buy it."
4,relax,Great album. Relaxing indie rock style. Very soothing and uplifting. Perfect if you want to chill with some friends or for the end of a D.J. slot.
3,Pretty Good,"Okay the album is pretty good. Ben Folds Five goes ""punk."" They sound a lot like the Get Up Kids, so just get the originals, TGUK."
4,Keep an eye on these guys,"After two quasi albums, SoCal's piano punks go mainstream with their first 'real' cd. Several of the tracks are found on their previous releases, but there's plenty of new material here for their loyal listeners. Personal favorites include ""The Astronaut"" and ""Not what it Seems"". ""Globes and Maps"" is this album's ""Walking By"", and ""Cavenaugh Park"" never sounded better.The band has been around for several years, but this release offers them their best stab at fame and fortune, the holy grail as well as the bane of indie rockers everywhere. ..."
3,don't jump out the window quite yet ....,"Lets get things straight - Andrew McMahon is no Ben Folds or Elton John. He has perfected his whiney pop-emo voice if you're into that kind of thing. He's perfected the standard rock format song. Leaving through the window is niether profound or extremely talented. All of that said, the album is considerably better than many of the pop-punk junk getting famous today and deserves to be recognized as such. Also, the band puts on a great show, - anybody who lights thier piano on fire and stomps it out has gotta be having fun. So go get it, jump around, cry if it moves you, and sing along at the top of your lungs. Its that kinda music."
2,Losing whatever made them special,"The best songs on this cd are the ones remade from their previous efforts. These songs sound really good given the benefits of higher-quality production. However, most of the new songs have little to offer if you are a fan of their previous work. The lyrics aren't very clever at all. I don't like their ballads; there is no joy or fun to them (unlike ""if U C Jordan""). They don't sound like a punk band anymore, and I don't like the direction they are going.Their rock songs were energetic and fun, but their newer songs just seem really boring to me..."
5,Definately a sleeper :),"I first heard ""Woke up in a Car"" on the independent station here in town. I fell in love with the catchy vocals, the moving piano, the great beat. I decided to purchase this album. Upon the first listen through, I wasn't horribly impressed, but by chance the CD played in my car for about a week and I was HOOKED! The lyrics are thoughtful, amusing, and the songs all fit together beautifully. I look forward to more from this band."
4,Just got it,I've been wanting this CD for a long time. I am not disappointed. It sounds really good. Get this CD.
5,Super CD!,"Wonderful CD. You'll want to listen to it over and over. Definately reccomended for all those emo-pop/punk music lovers. Every song is good, and the lyrics are very clever. Can't wait for the next CD."
5,Fantastic Group!,"Something Corporate is one of the most finest rock groups of today! (My favorite group next to Finch!) The rock to ballad piano style is often missed in today's music, but Andrew Mcmahon really brings it out in his songs. ""Cavanaugh Park"" is one of my favorites! The piano playing is real kool sounding with it's tempo and meter changes!""Not What It Seems"" is also a great with it's driving rock pulse.If you want great music with great vocals...get this CD!!!!Can't wait to hear the new CD!!! Thanks Drive-Thru Records"
3,Like Ben Folds minus the cynicism (and great songwriting.),"I was turned on to this band by a friend, and I have mixed emotions about them. I consider ""Leaving Through the Window"" not necessarily a great album, but an introduction to a great album they'll probably put out in a couple years. Talented, fresh, and young, so they have a ways to go. If you like this at all, do yourself a HUGE favor and get into Ben Folds Five (especially their early stuff.) They sound a lot like SC, but the lyrics are a lot more clever, and the sound is a little more mature. All in all not a bad band (except for the name... Something Corporate? What's that all about?) I'd download some of their stuff first before I went out and bought the album."
4,great Cd very original,I dont really like punk music but this is very different music. The piano gives it an entirely different taste. Each song is great in its own way. A great band with lots of potential. It definetly worth it to buy.
3,The Kid Who Knows,"I bought this CD because, I really like Something Corporate. But, I find myself extremely disappoited. Besides the 3 hit songs it has (If You C Jordan, Hurricane, and Cavanaugh Park) the other songs are duds. I think the CD is not worth your money. You're better off to just download the 3 hits and, leave the CD at the store."
4,Great,"Wow, I must say I was surprised with this album. When I first heard the demo version of Hurricane, I thought it was a great song and I thought that I should give the album the try. I must say I was impressed. All the songs but ""if you see jordan"" are good. I mean, this album is not perfect, but it's one of those albums that you can just sit and chill to. The piano mixed with the guitar blend perfectly with one another, and although Andrew's vocals can get a little nasal, he still has a sound that is his own and he can really sing. This seems like it shouldn't be a drive thru production. So if you're in a good mood or want to be in a good mood than whip that sum 41 out of your cd player and check them out."
5,THE BEST CD EVER!!!!!,"Okay, if you've never heard Something Corporate, you are MISSING OUT!!!!! This is an incredible CD that will affect you in so many ways...The best songs are, in no particular order, Cavanaugh Park (sooo nostalgic and sad/happy at the same time), Fall (the first line of the second verse is just amazing), and Straw Dog (the first verse is incredible)...I hardly ever buy CDs (i burn most of them...bad, i know) but this is one of the few cds that i've bought and not regretted. Spend the $15 and support SOCO. also, i've seen them in concert, and they're INCREDIBLE!!! BUY THIS CD!!! ITS INCREDIBLE!!!"
1,Zero stars - worst book I've ever read,"This book is poorly written. The grammer, word use, and organization are terrible. But it's the content that brought me to write this review. The author, who is apparently a selfish, mean-spirited person by nature, uses his ""experiences"" as a woman-hater to attempt to enlighten the writer. He fails miserbly, while going off on tangents to insert unrelated views on unrelated topics. This book continually offended me - as a Christian, as a woman, and as a moral member of society. Unless you happen to be looking for Christ so that you can fry the perfect egg for you husband, this book is not for you."
5,An Awesome book about our Identity in Christ!,"Wow!Bill Gillham is a wonderful author. And this book dives right in to the fundamental truth that we have to know and understand in order to live the successful Christian life:Our identity in Christ and what it means to us as believers.The first half of the book deals with a lot of psychology and was very valueable in learning what my own ""flesh pattern"" was. This book was instrumental in the writing of my first book, 'Christ Through Me' (see my profile).Definitely a must read, this book was well worth it!"
5,a Must Read,"Not a fast read, but a must read ! Teaches how you can be free...free from trying to do it all on your own.Keep a highlighter handy !"
2,Disappointing Video,"Have been researching UFOs since the fifties, and bought this DVD direct from the source. Could have saved a lot by buying from Amazon.This is more of a life story for James Gilliland; I was expecting more discussion on the ""contacts"". Saw a few bouncing lights and little else. Most of the claims and statements I had heard before. Not a bad DVD; just not what I surmised from the title."
2,It is a free world..,"and people are free to move to better prospects!In the 1980s, foreign students from Taiwan, India, China, etc, flooded the US for MBA, PhD, etc. Then they got jobs, moved up the corporate ladder, worked very hard to become CEOs. But most of them never made it beyond the bench work engineers, hardly VP or CEOs. Now the opportunities existed in their home countries. Of course, they will go back. It is nothing new. The flight of capital is a good indicator of the growing economy. The more India and China growing, the more the world is growing. The 2.3 billion people of India and China, is 40% of the world population.Now that Chinese and Indian companies are getting IPOs and doing well. The next step, they will be investing in USA by buying everything: US companies, stock and bonds, hedge funds, private equity, mutual fund, pension fund, etc. The flight of capital is now Foreign Direct Investment(FDI) in USA. The book misses this important point."
5,Losing the competitive edge,"Richard Florida's ""The Flight of the Creative Class"" and this book by David Heenan hit the on the same challenge facing America. Intellectual capital is mobile and increasing it is being drawn to locales other than America. Lacking Florida's narcissism and hyperbole, Heenan's level-headed approach to this topic is considerably more appealing. Heenan explains how societal, institutional, and cultural factors in the US are driving knowledge workers away from our shores and creating incentives for their return to their nation of birth. Heenan also goes into great depth detailing the efforts of nations such as China, Taiwan, and India to draw these well-educated people back home."
2,It's just ok...,"Was a bit disappointed when I received the item in the mail. Container holding the charcoal was tin-ny and cheap. I guess the contents themselves (pieces of charcoal, other pencils) were all fine- it's just that the presentation/box it came in was lacking. Also discovered that the outside cardboard and plastic packaging was damaged and partly opened. Made me question how reputable the company was- and why I didn't just go for a more recognizable brand (Faber Castell, Strathmore, etc). Disappointed since I was giving it as a gift. Ended up purchasing another set- post-Christmas, a Prisma-Color collection from Strathmore. The packaging/presentation was much nicer. I guess this set would have been fine- if you were looking to pay less money and didn't need it as a gift."
1,THANKS HYATT!!!!!!,"I've never reviewed something before but for this item I felt the need to share.The product arrived right on time and boy was I pleased to see that Hyatt already opened my package for me!! We all know how solid charcoal is, especially to be traveling loosely in a box!! I was so pleased to find it ripped open inside the box and in multiple pieces!!! Thanks guys! I understand, why not just take an item that is already open and throw it in a box and send it away, I mean what's its bought WHO CARES?! Now I should say thanks, now instead of 3 charcoal pencils like I ordered I have 6 or 7 smaller broken pencils. WHAT A DEAL!!! Order from Hyatt, THEY WILL MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MATTER!!"
2,Charcoal pencil set,"I only gave it 2 stars becasue they didn't hold up long enough. I had one sitting on the kitchen counter top getting ready to use it, and all it did was drop a few feet to the floor and it was broken in pieces. Then, several others got broken very easily as well. I think they should be made to last longer, esp. for what I paid for them.Mary Lord"
1,One Star,"Do You Promise Not to Tell? Nope. This is one of the choppiest books I have ever read. I could not figure out the characters; they were never developed. Just as I started to see depth in a character, the chapter would end and the next would be about some other character; it was frustrating. I feel confident in telling readers this isn't worth taking the time to read."
3,El Padrino-You can never follow up on an awesome album.,"""El Hombre..."" was an an awesome album and after that I popped this CD in the car expecting to be blown to bits. But, it was okay. A few too many samples and eclecticism made this album seem to be that the producer was trying too hard instead of relying on the great Latin roots of the last album. Its got Latin, with Italian, with Samba, with Merengue Dance House. It was still a good album, though. Just don't expect the ""all-night Latin party"" danceability of the last album."
3,El Padrino,"I am a fan of Fulanito and I have to say that the first album was a little bit better. ""El Padrino"" does have some good tracks. The first 4 tracks are wonderful, especially if you like to dance.If you're a Fulanito fan no matter what, then get this CD."
3,Just wanted to see Ms Tilly.,"It's another just watch once movie for me.As far as Ms Tilly's role, I got to see her enough."
4,Nearly there,"The Milwaukee power screwdriver is almost there. The torque is tremendous for the 2.4 volt motor. It's still solid and doesn't have any signs of bearing squawk - and I got it used. It's weight makes it a little heavy to grab for minor household repairs - but for repetitive jobs like driving dozens of sheet metal screws, changing outlets, or setting molly screws in sheetrock walls, it is a real wrist saver.It would be a real advantage to have a bit holder on the driver itself instead of on the charger. Buy a magnetic bit extension so you can use those bits they sell on the hardware counter at 5 for a buck!It's time for new batteries, since the ones I have are tired out. Not sure how long they last since the driver and batteries were used when I got it. If they last like the driver, I'll be a one happy camper."
4,"Really ""Getting Started""","Our local Guitar store recommended this book as their second runner up for those just starting with guitar. My daughter and I have just begun working on it but I feel, nevertheless, I can give you more information than is here. ""Getting Started"" is *very* simple and basic. It has cartoon like drawings for illustrations and not much text--great for a younger learner who is impatient with learning. As an older learner I'm left with some questions. The songs start on page 16 with ""Down in the Valley"" followed by ""Tom Dooley"", ""Red River Valley"", etc. ending with ""Wabash Cannonball"". My teenage daughter nearly got all the strings backwards at the start of the book and may well have finished, doing everything backwards--good reason for including a casette tape or CD in your independent learning if you have no experience."
4,DRY WALL BANJO,"1ST TIME USING ONE. I CAN'T REACH CEILING WITHOUT A LATTER. THIS WORKED VERY WELL ON THE WALL SEAMS, BUT YOU NEED TO RUN THE WHOLE SEAM AND YOU CAN'T DO IT AND MOVE THE LATTER."
1,goldblatt 15330,"cumberson and too heavy for the ceiling work that i needed to get done. never used it . if i could return it without paying shipping, i would. new, never used."
5,Goldblatt banjo,"This is for an employee. I have been using the same one for over 15 years. It's light weight, easy to control and easy to clean up. Worth every penny. It will hold a 500' roll of tape but for weight reasons I use the 250'"
3,"Missing Parts, poor quality","My Goldblatt banjo came missing the thumb nut screw that adjusts the amount of mud that goes on the tape. Also, the case was extremely sharp on the edges and the welds were ugly. Almost cut my finger the first time I used it. Have since had to file down all the edges on the door, and use a bolt to adjust the mud. Poor quality control. Made in China. I would recommend a Marshalltown over this Banjo."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is more of Robbins' whacky silliness, with a woman touring all over the place to find someone compatible and display her jeans to best advantage.She ends up encountering other odd characters in her quest to find out where she fits in, and what this shagging thing is all about."
1,Not worth Reading!!!,When the book started off talking about a girl born with a huge thumb deformity and hitchiking I knew I should have stopped there but I was reading it for a book club. This is the worst book I have ever read. The author is arrogant and schizo at the same time in this book. Very immoral and he does not capture women's thoughts or feelings very well at all.
3,Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,"I thought the concepts and political criticism was poignant and well-executed. However, I thought the long run-on sentences were difficult to get through. Paragraphs that last pages and an overabundance of descriptions makes this a boring, drawn-out read."
4,WITTY AND SANE,I really loved this book. I think that Tom Robbins is quite a weirdo himself to have written something about the odd and not-so-normal people we normally push away from our day-to-day horizons. here we writes of them with compassion and a riveting originality that is just...mind-blowing. do read this book! i think it's not as good as jitterbug perfume but one of the best of tom robbins' novels nonetheless!
4,"Well, its tom allright...","OK, the scene is fantastical and the characters are a little strange but they dont, in tom style seem unapproachable. Tom has a way of doing better than ""normal people in extraordinary situations"" bit. rather it is strange people in a strange land and he makes you believe it. Wild metaphors and brilliant observations abound. You would be hard pressed NOT to come away with Something excellent from this book-j"
5,An unforgettable lark; Sissy's giant thumbs hitchike West,"Sissy is a beautiful small-town girl with a messed up start, and a pair of giant thumbs.She can flag any vehicle down with her huge digits, and takes off into the West.She spends a good deal of time at the Rubber Rose Ranch,a dudette ranch manned only by cowgirls, financed by douche sales(a typically Tom Robbins-esque construct which is so silly as to be almost possible).Sissy's introductions to life, love, death, and compromise are a mixture of sweet and sour,comedy and tragedy. A great read"
2,a big insulting let-down,"I was so excited to read this, and it just made me mad. I wouldn't care so much, I guess, but it's a kind of writing I like, done poorly. Robbins knows what he's doing, but he is just astoundingly arrogant and bigoted, so much that it makes my head reel. His tangential asides are not about the plot, or even (as they supposedly are) about themselves, but about Robbins, and about how he's extremely clever. Well, I don't think he's so much clever as he is obnoxious and self-satisfied. His dialogue is sloppy, his plot is questionable, his form is narcissitic at best, and his novel, ultimately, would be interesting only from an historical perspective, and that only if it were actually original. N.B.: I very much like Kurt Vonnegut, Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace, Douglas Adams, Dostoevsky, Barthelme, &c. (that off the top of my head). Judge based on that whether or not my opinion is relevant to you."
3,A long read,"The book was a little slow and difficult to get into at times. However, there were moments in the book that I really enjoyed."
1,TR Tries too Hard,Robbins reminds me of the over-hyped Jerry Seinfeld (who also is not as funny or clever as he thinks). They both try too hard.
1,Not for me...,"I bought this book not knowing what I was getting myself into. I wanted to throw this book away. Maybe it just wasn't my type of book, but it just was NOT enjoyable to me.Some of the descriptions went on FOREVER when the author was describing something that could've been done in one or two words in my opinion.Don't get me wrong, there were some enjoyable moments in the book, but overall, I was thoroughly UNimpressed.I think what drew me to the book was the title.I also was going to get one of his other books, but decided to try one, then see how it goes from there. Now I'm skeptical about trying another one. It took me forever to get through this book, and I was not satisfied at all."
1,hated it,"made no sense. stupid plot and story line. don't waste your money if you're looking for anything of value in this authors works, you won't find it if this is indicative."
1,Awful,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend whose taste in books is usually very similar to mine. When I gave her this book back, I was tempted to punch her in the face.You can literally skip chapters and when you pick back up you will have missed nothing. There are at least 30 pages dedicated to explaining how an ancient indian tribe kept track of time. WHY? That literally has absolutely nothing to do with the book. Tim Robbins would start on a long, overly detailed, often nonsensical description of something, and I'd start skipping pages, only to find that 5, 6, or even 20 pages later when I tried to pick back up, he was still describing the same thing.I tried to get through it, but this is literally the only book I have ever been unable to finish."
1,"Two very large, unenthusiastic thumbs down.","I have struggled through this book for 3 1/2 weeks and finally finished it. WARNING: Do not judge the brilliance of Tom Robbins on this wordy excuse for a good idea. I felt nothing for any of the characters, and I cared nothing for the story. Usually after reading a Tom Robbins novel, I'm left with a book full of underlines and folded-down corners. This book left me exhausted, unfulfilled... Skip it and pick up ""Still Life With Woodpecker"" instead. You won't be singing the blues.P.S. I would have given this book No Stars, but since that wasn't an option, I gave it one."
5,terrific....,"I knew it was a good book, because by the time I had finished it I had experienced every emotion a book could possibly make me feel. I loved some of these characters, hated others, I laughed, I cried, I read on in horror, disappointment, rage, elation, and pure estatic joy. The pure music of Robbins's words carried me out of this world and into a world of magic and poetry. Even after the first few pages, I had learned that all I had to do was toss a thumb in the air and I could hitch a ride to a place where I could learn a little bit more about the world around me and be completely enchanted in the process. I'm glad I was able to find my way to the clockworks. I have run across very few authors that have the same love of language Robbins does. I applaud this book loudly and recommend it to everybody... not just the aspiring cowgirl. It's philisophical content is inspiring."
5,"a beautiful, indelible addition to the imagination","This book is one of those rare experiences that can transport you to a world of emotional and intellectual bliss. Even thinking about this book can get you there. I remember carrying a supply of cloves and butterscotch Life Savers after I first read it. Reading ECGtB made me realize what language is capable of, and how thoroughly it can express our desires and observations. Delicious!!!"
5,Philosophy in bite size pieces & sprinkled with funny sauce,"TR is a fantastic writer. Not fantastic in the literary sense like Dickens or Melville, but fantastic in a more popular sense. The man can spin a yarn. What imagination he has. It's all unbelievable fiction but that doesn't hinder the enjoyment one bit. He manages to mingle fantasy, philosophy, and plot in the sweetest way. The characters are so compelling. And I found myself laughing out loud at least once every 1/2 hour. Read it and laugh!"
1,aaaaaaaaawwful!!!!,"Tom Robbins is a pig. Not only do I hate the way he writes about women, I feel he has an attitude about it. His repetitive cutesy prose is bothersome when you read a Robbins book for the first time, and by the time you read this book you can barely finish. And what's with his drawn out sex scenes that don't seem to add or take away anything from the characters! I hope people do not compare his fiction with true literature."
1,I'm amazed that anyone could possibly enjoy this book.,"This book should be douched out of existence. I'm amazed that anyone could enjoy this pointless, digressive orgy of self-indulgence. Tom Robbins may have a flair for creative, zany analogies, but strung together endlessly, they amount to nothing and make the book simply one big banal mixed metaphor. Flush it; don't read it."
1,"""See how clever I am?""","This book was awful. I only gave it a star because I didn't see a ""0 stars"" choice. The book is disgusting and it's major themes are ""I'm Tom Robbins. I'm SO clever!"" and ""Who cares about anybody else? Pleasure is the only real good."" If I never read another book by him it will be too soon!"
1,Just plain weird,"A gifted writer, some great prose and amazing metaphors. But no real story that engages."
1,Couldn't get through it,"I loved ""Jitterbug Perfume"" and thought I'd enjoy ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"" as well. I couldn't even get through half of it. Robbins is WAY too wordy and relies too much on the gag that Sissy's huge thumbs make her an excellent hitchhiker. The characters are one dimensional and the storyline was SO boring I couldn't stand it. I can only assume that Robbins had already become famous by this point and thus refused any help from his editors to spice up his syntax and trim out the fat."
1,UGGGGHH I want the last 2 weeks of my life back,"I was attracted to the title, but really after the reading the first page, I knew in my heart of hearts that this book should only be read if you are stoned from sun up to sun down. Maybe in my wild 20's I could have tolerated this book, but the constant dribble that is spilled out over more than 300 pages, what a waste of a tree. If it weren't for the book club that I just joined I would have quit reading it, turns out I was the only that made it through what can only be called, The Ramblings of a Schizophrenic. Luckily I purchased the book from a used book store and since I just purchased an outdoor fireplace, I now have some kindling."
5,"FYI, Angry Fundies...","Rick Warren does not receive a dime of royalties from the Purpose Driven products. So, get your facts straight before defaulting to ad hominem plastering of him. Such personal judgments sound like the kind of thing that should come from God alone.I, for one, think it's a great idea to publish the scriptures on cards. It's an attractive and practical way to help get the Word infused in your life."
4,"Troy from Hudson, WI",What a great gift and a solid reminder! I have it at my desk...I surely am pleased with my purchase and you will be too.
1,Capitalizing on God - What a CRIME,"What a disgusting JOKE! Rick Warren isn't a man of God - he's a man with a large bank account! What next - Purpose-Driven Toothpaste? Purpose-Driven Hemmorhoid Medication? How about Purpose-Driven Burgers? When is it going to stop?!?!? How many books did Jesus write? Did He brag about having a HUGE church? Why didn't Jesus have ""Scripture Keeper Plus With Cards?"" Enough is enough - how about living a life like Jesus, Rick Warren? Give up EVERYTHING. Work with the ill, infirm, sick, dying - EVERYDAY?! Did Jesus need Peter Drucker to market his Word? Oh well...this is just yet another item to help boost your bank account. (Did Jesus need one of those?)"
1,"Wow, What a Shame","Isn't it sad that God gave each person a mind and yet some are so blind to reality that they simply can't accept the fact that the Purpose-Drivel Corporation is more intent on making money with merchandise with paraphrased quotes, many of which are taken OUT OF CONTEXT, than with spreading the real Word of God. We should pray for those who are so blind."
5,"Great price, best I found anywhere when you order auto shipping",This is great stuff. Have baby that cannot use anything else and this price is great and I love auto shipping. I never have to worry about running out.
5,FABULOUS!!,"The only exposure I had had to Thoroughly Modern Millie was from Sutton Foster's performance on the Tony's, but that alone moved me to buy the cd. Sutton Foster's voice is one of the BEST I have ever heard. All the songs she sings are sooo great! As for the rest of the songs I love them too. I wish I lived close to NYC so I could go see this wonderful cast perform it live but this cd will have to do for now. I definitely urge everyone who enjoys musical theater to buy this album!!"
5,Thoroughly Modern Millie is spectacular!,"Sutton Foster is new to the world of Broadway, but she handles it like a pro. Her voice, attitude, and personality make the part of Millie shine! The Tony Award for Best Actress, awarded to Ms. Foster, was well deserved. Her clear, crisp, and clean notes make the show more fun to watch and listen to. She is amazing. The supporting cast for the show shined aswell. Its a great ensemble show, and the ensemble in this production live up to that. The show itself is a blast and privelege to listen to, i THOROUGHLY recommend it. Sutton Foster's voice is worth the money for the CD itself."
2,Millie needs help,"Gibert and Sullivan, J. Van Heusen and Victor Herbert tried to help, giving Millie its best moments. Its the orignal songs that don't deliver. The cast belts them out as if they were gems by Berlin or Porter, but it dosn't help. A weak score tied to a silly book gives us one of the poorest examples of a Tony winner."
2,Oh no!,"I had to rip this out of the player and put on the film soundtrack just to stop the surge of depression. If you've never seen the film you might enjoy the album, but it appears to have been subjected to a politically correct reworking of the plot and characters, and the same pervasive quality of anemia characterizes most of the new music. None of the new music can begin to compare with the original title number by Van Heusen, and no one in the cast comes close to Julie, Carol, and Mary. Pity. Most tellingly, no credit for the other composers on the show's poster reproduced on the album."
3,Fun But Nothing New,"Cute, tuneful, and lively, but nothing groundbreaking or original. A pleasant, old fashioned, good old musical comedy, done very well. Lot's of fun with a terrific score of songs from the 68 movie combined with Jeanine Tesori's new tunes for this production, blended fairly seamlessly thanks to the snappy orchestrations. The cast is first rate, Sutton Foster showing why she is the Broadway star she has become. Marc Kudish, Gavin Creel and Sheryl Lee Ralph all shining, and Harriet Harris, Beebee on Frasier stealing the show in every scene she was in. Her big number, They Don't Know stopped the show, and she won a Tony.Very little relation to the movie other than a few of the songs and the very basic plot, but fun and the cast recording is enjoyable."
4,A very good representation of the show.,"Though <cite>Thoroughly Modern Millie</cite> is far from a perfect musical, it has produced a faithful and enjoyable cast recording that harkens back to the earlier decades of cast albums in its style and presentation. Though very little dialogue (and therefore little sense of the story) is present on the disc, almost all of the show's music is present, including the overture and, yes, even the curtain call music. Sutton Foster, in the title role, is no Julie Andrews, but has a winning belt and gives an enjoyable rendition of each of her songs. Sheryl Lee Ralph, Gavin Creel, Marc Kudisch, and Angela Christian give her strong support, though Harriet Harris--hilarious in the theatre--doesn't come across well. Still, if you like the show, you'll like the cast album, and if you have yet to be introduced to the stage version but won't be able to see it for a while, this will probably tide you over."
2,No comparison to the original,"Don't get me wrong, the voices are wonderful the new songs are fresh and maybe if it had a different title i would have loved it. I've heard the cast recording and have seen the production and was disappointed. It wasn't as good as the original with the strong cast that really lived each character. The music in this production was ""bla"". It just doesn't go anywhere. Rent or buy the movie,,,it is much better. Maybe someday they will put the movie on DVD,,,,,hint, hint. PLEASE."
2,Better than movie,"The Broadway version was better than the movie due to the fact the songs were much improved and better. I still think this show lacks something in the music though. it is just not up there with the likes of ""The Sound of Music"", ""The Lion King"", ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"". The songs are to repetitive and don't touch you like some others in other musicals. The theme song is wonderful, but it is not a musical where every song can get stuck in your head."
2,Showcases the weaknesses of the show,"Even though I found the show to be mediocre, I purchased this recording hoping that the songs could be enjoyable by themselves. However, I found myself simply remembering how weak the production was. The performances are fine (Sutton sounds MUCH worse than she does live, however), but many of the best melodies are the ones not written for this production, except for ""Forget About the Boy"" (which should be about 10 minutes longer, ""Gimme Gimme"" and ""Not for the Life of Me."" The simpler version of the title song that appeared on the sampler CD was much better, and the remainder of the songs are not not rememberable, with no clever lyrics to redeem them. While I was looking forward to both the production and the CD very much, both let me down."
5,Thoroughly Delightful!,"One of the best Cast recordings to come out in recent years! It sounds exactly like it does in the show and as soon as you leave the theater and put the CD again, you can imagine everything because of its almost identical sounds! You will NOT be disapointed! and go see the show!! Sutton Foster is one of the best new actors out there! and shes super nice and humble!"
3,Thoroughly Modern Millie,"Truth be told it took me a while to warm up to this cast Album beacuse at first listen it is dull, bland , and completly boring.But after a few listens I really got into it althought there are still problems and I only like a few songs I don't completly detest it like I did the first time I heard it.The songs I enjoy are:Not For The Life of MeThoroughly Modern MillieThey Don't KnowThe Speed TestWhat Do I need With LoveForget About the BoyLong As I'm here With YouThe problem with Millie is that the slow songs are boring or from another show which is annoying. it seems the the people who wrote the music and lyrics for this show only used their talent on the up-beat songs but slacked on the slow ballads.Buy this album only if you are a super Broadway fan like me , other-wise you will probably be dissapointed."
2,Another potentially fine work ruined by a crude stereotype.,"I approached this show with caution, after reading such lackluster reviews as New Yorker magazine's comment ""thoroughly boring, shrilly"". I walked away with mixed feelings. I think the New Yorker criticized it for all the wrong reasons. The songs were fun and infectiously toe-tapping, the sets gleamingly art-deco, and the costumes were bright and lovely, but they had to go damage it with that whole ... Chinese laundry worker/ dragon lady/ white slavery bit. (Think of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" horrific Mickey Rooney character.) It could have been an enjoyable show, but as an Asian-American, in the end I couldn't help but cringe."
2,A big letdown...,"Millie was a huge letdown for me. I went and saw the show after it won the tony for Best Musical, and expected something special. The only thing special about this show and the cd is the performance of Sutton Foster. She is funny, bright and has a nice voice. Sadly, the material is beneath her and the performance.There are two memorable songs in this show, both sung by Sutton Foster. The rest of the show is a mess and a waste of time. I laughed twice in the entire 2 and a half hour show. The songs don't belong anywhere near a broadway stage, and the fact that it is still running is just sad. One or two love songs in a show is fine...but this show has love song after love song, and they aren't catchy, hummable or even mediocre! There is nothing special about the show ""Thoroughly Modern Millie,"" just Sutton Fosters performance."
1,Does not Play,"I bought this C.D. for nothing because when i got it home, it would not play in any of my cd players"
4,Great road trip toy and all around fun thing to have,"My son loves to have this with him on trips. He draws, practices his writing, and uses it as a giant Blues Clues Notebook. He has used it for hours. I have bought the small one as well. The stamps are a nice change of pace and the fact that the pen is attachted is Brilliant!!"
3,Doodle Pro,"This is a nice product, but not as nice as the actual magna doodle. It's not as durable and the writing/doodling on it is fuzzier on this product."
3,Loves it but not as good as the original,I remember the original Magnadoodles being sturdier. My 2 year old loves this one but it doesn't erase very well and she keeps getting the stamps jammed in the frame. I'm glad I bought it because she likes it but I wish it was made better. Get a real Magnadoodle if you can. If I have to replace this one I sure will.
3,"Ehhhhhhh, Okay...","I bought this toy for my neice for Christmas and was disappointed in the quality of it when we took it out of the box.The magnets didn't really show up on the screen, even when an adult pushed on them pretty hard. There is no way a three year old could push on them hard enough for them to actually show up.It ended up tossed in the never seen again pile at her house. :o("
5,My kids love it!,"It's just such a fun and simple toy that both my kids love-ages 1 and 3. The best part for me is, it doesn't use any batteries!!!! I would definatley reccomend this toy"
5,Just like the episode of Dora,This book is just like the corresponding Backpack epsiode of the Dora show. If your child likes that I am sure that he/she will love this book.
2,dora book,"I was not pleased with this purchase and am sending it back. It did not arrive in the appropriate time, and was not worth the money in shipping. It cost me four times the amount of the book."
5,another great Dora book,"This is a good paperback Dora book. It fits the typical Dora episode format. She uses her backpack to return books to the library. They follow the map's directions, get through opsticles, and avoid Swipper the Fox. They use a few words in Spanish and have 8 books to count once they reach the library. We read it every night!"
2,hmmm,"When you find a good lamp fragrance, stick with it! I bought this as it was a bit cheaper than other fragrances and it's not as nice as others."
1,we need some help,we just bought the gamebut we cannot install itthe '' pota.exe '' file is failing all the timesomebody can help us pleasethnxSpeedy
4,Not Bad.,It's very good. It makes the trombone slide feel much heavier though. The added protection is 1st. class. A good product
4,It does the job.,Was surprised that this is all plastic. It does the job of protecting the slide bow but it would be great it the tip was rubber to keep the trombone from sliding on the floor while not playing it.
3,It Works,"I originally bought this protector for my main bass horn, but it was too small. I did find use for it on my tenor horn, however! For the price, this is a great deal if it fits your horn. It is constructed of cheap plastic, but it gets the job done and protects the slide bow well."
3,Stiff,"Not rubbery like I thought. Quite stiff and almost broke if my slide had been any bigger. Definitely NOT meant for professional horns, but still cool if it fits."
2,It was interesting but vague.,"Michael J. Rood's video was somewhat entertaining but his arguments in the video were not very well constructed. Mr. Rood, perhaps because of time constraints, did not give enough supporting evidence to most of his claims. This gave me the impression (true or false) that he was articulating his own personal theories and not scholarly ones. Mr. Rood's mission to expose paganism in some Christian traditions is commendable but he needs to add more information to his arguments."
3,Nice toy ... but smaller than expected,"For the price I was expecting the helicopter to be bigger, it is not much bigger than a matchbox car. My 2 yr old likes it and I would prob buy it again, since I have been looking for awhile for an age appropriate helicopter for him."
4,Another Quality Item,"Harold is fun off the tracks...our 2 year old loves flying him around and then landing him back on his Thomas table. Very durable and no sharp edges to worry about, plus Harold is lightweight so you don't have to worry about dropping on toes or denting wooden floors."
5,Every train table should have a harold,Solid constuction - great for the imagination. Our son has taken his train table play to the air. Great toy.
3,cute but too small,"I didn't realise how small this plane was when i ordered lol.. check the specs before you order , that was my fault. It is still a cute LITTLE Helicopter though.."
4,Harold's propellers break easily,"I have a normal active three year old boy, who loves his Harold. However, the propellers are made of a hard plastic that snap if they are stepped on or smacked around - hard to avoid with a 3 yr old boy! Thank goodness for the lifetime replacement guarantee - that's why I continue to buy this brand. Harold has been replaced twice - my son thinks he goes to the repair shop! Overall the Thomas wooden train system is incredible, but like any brand, it does have it's glitches."
4,Great toy but breaks easily,"My kids have several Thomas toys from Imaginarium and they LOVE them. This one is the least durable of the bunch. 2 blades have broken off of Harold, so his flying is a little lopsided these days. I think they need to try another approach for the blades."
4,Broken propellers!!,My son has repeatedly broken the plastic propeller. Why can't it be made of wood like the rest of it. I was disappointed with Harold being plastic. Luckily they replace it for us. We love the thomas toys
3,Smaller Than Advertised Size,"I just got this helicopter yesterday for my 17-month old son. My only problem with it is that it is smaller than the advertised size. The Amazon page under ""Product Details"" currently states (and I bought it relying on this statement) that the Product Dimensions are 4.5 x 2.4 x 3 inches. Unless my ruler is defective (unlikely), the true size is 3 7/8 x 2 x 2 inches. It shouldn't be hard for Amazon to accurately list product measurements - seriously, come on Amazon, you can do better than that. While the listed size is not that much bigger, the actual product is pretty small and could use this minor increase in size. That's what I reasonably expected to receive so I'm not too happy with it."
4,Double cluck plus,"I picked this model up at Cabelas for $21 its a solid call. It has great sound and is easy to master. Solid inexpensive call, great for entry-mid experience calling. Good range of sound, nice lanyard attached, I would say this is a solid piece to purchase."
4,A Saint for Our Generation,"I found myself unable to put this book down, devouring it in a day's time and finding myself to inspired by this great saint. The author's organization makes it for an easy read - starting with one aspect of Blessed Pier's life and spirituality, covering it in depth, and then moving on to another. Pier was a multi-faceted man - a romantic, a mystic, an athlete, a student, an outspoken political critic, a son/brother, and a friend. Thank God this author is able to write beautifully on Pier from each of those aspects in such a manner that anyone who reads this book will feel a connection to this blessed youth."
2,Same old stuff,"Not a bad book, but not worth spending the money on. It's the same old ideas that you've seen everywhere just compiled I really only got about 3 pages total out of the whole book of ideas."
5,Loved it!,Loved it! The cloths are nice and well threaded which makes them very handy when cleaning up spills or washing dishes.
1,They shed?,"After you wash them the fabric/strings start to come off and hang loose. I find myself having to cut them off or else they look terrible and the strings get in the way. If it wasn't for that, they'd make a good, typical wash rag."
4,Just what I wanted!!,These dishcloths are perfect - thirsty and soft. They are just what I've been looking for: not fancy plain old-fashioned dishcloths. The price is perfect too!
1,These are horrid,I received waffle-weave dish towels that I actually threw away. The hassle of returning them was too much so I chucked them because they were such horrible quality!
3,JUST OK,"I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I WAS THINKING DISH TOWEL, NOT DISH CLOTH. THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LARGER. THEY ARE NICE, THOUGH."
2,Dish Towels,I bought these towels to give as a gift and I was disappointed. The came frayed and looked less than ideal. I had to send them back because they were not gift worthy. It took a while to hear anything from the company and how to return the product and then on my money. It's a shame because the colors of the towels were great.
1,Not absorbing,I found these waffle weave dishcloths to not be very effective . They do not absorb liquid well and leave a very wet counter top.
3,3.5 stars - A delightful debut.,"This book works because of the characters and the dialogue. The plot is a bit weak and way too much attention was spent on telling us where Jason parked his car. But the relationship between Jason and his mother, who owns the detective agency, is delightful and characterized by quips reminiscent of the 20s. It's a delightful first book and I am looking forward to the next one."
3,A great resource,This book is great for anyone in Youth Ministry. The book does an awesome job or getting to the point. The ideas they share are proven not just some of the random ideas that usually get throw into books. It is a great resource
2,Not a good book to read & learn,"This is the worst Tax book I have ever read. The concepts introduced in text are not in details, not many examples for illustration.I sold the book right after I had finished my class, don't even bother to keep it as I often do for other books.Good luck to you if you're required to use this text for your class since you may need to spend double the time you need to read a regular Tax textbook."
5,Love Thomas and Friends,Amazon pricing far better than any store sale price... Inherited other Thomas and Friends wooden trains that are now 15 yrs old and still in pretty good condition. To get all 8 original engines a pricey investment but great for hand me down toys to last a decade or more...
5,Henry,"Henry is up to expectations and other positive reviews.Has been typical used by 2yr. old and 4 yr. old, and holds out great.Aids in magnectics, colour and number recognition."
5,Another Train for the Collection,"Henry is one of the classic trains in the Thomas collection, a must have! Yes, these trains are not cheap, but they are so DURABLE and well made! I expect these trains to last for at least another generation :)"
5,Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway - Henry,If you have a boy that loves trains and cars this is a great toy. My son loves to play with Henry. It's great to see that he has an imagination.
4,Jackie on tenor,"If you dig Jackie this side will interest you greatly. It is the only recording of Jackie on tenor that i know of. You can hear a whole lot of Sonny Rollins here, but unmistably Jackie McLean.Also there is a great argument between Jackie and Gil Coggins.I love this side.peace"
2,Bigger than expected,"This is the second one in this series I have purchased. I should have known from the first that the size is extra large making it hard to store. Plus the spoon is larger in depth than I expected.The grip is nice, but that's it. Not enough to warrant buying others."
2,The sloppiest gun I've ever used,I have one of these but I don't like it very much. It's poorly designed. It dribbles mud out continuously. One of my guys has one too and his does the same thing. We have guns from three other manufacturers that don't drip all over the floor like this one. They cost less $$ to boot.
3,ok I guess,"the good news is the usual low price for thesethe bad news is they really could've been great moviesso not bad for your collection, but not great either, but hey, not every movie can be fantastic and if it entertains you, then no harm- no foul"
3,sound levels too low,I never understood why the sound on this movie was so low. I have had to watch it several times to really enjoy it. Great soundtrack though.
2,The music and singing is kind of... adult.,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. However, it was incredibly dissapointing. I don't understand the awards for animation. With the exception of the animated humans, it was remarkably un-remarkable to watch. The monotony of the black and white with the weird sexual shapes, sounds and overtones was rather disgusting in a childrens animated movie.I'm no prude I assure you, but I don't appreciate watching a ""family movie"" with the rather startling moans and groans that these penguins ""sing."" Gross.Too Bad. I wanted to like it."
4,Fun Movie,My family really enjoys this movie. It has parts that are drawn out and the kids always loose interest at that point.
4,good,"The graphics on this look amazing on my new tv! Howerver, sometimes I get a little irritated with all the current music in kids films and when they make the characters overly hip."
3,OK for younger children,"Dancing penguins are good for little kids. My grandchildren seems to like the movie. I don't know how a penguin with a Scottish accent advances the story, but I suppose it's meant to distinguish that penguin from the others (a problem with penguins). This is a kids' movie that I have to sit through rather than enjoy with the kids, but they are ok with it."
2,Lacks a Plot,"First, Robin Williams does too many of the characters. There are scenes when two of his characters are in the same frame and it seems like his accents merged.Second, This movie lacks a real plot. It gives the impression that it is a movie about the penguin getting acceptance for not being like other penguins, but then they add in an adventure that has very little to do with moving the story along. It does make the movie a lot longer than it should have been. It also makes you check how much time is left.Third, The most enjoyable part of this movie was the mixture of music. It was interesting how they would take two or three different hit songs and merge them.If you have young children who want to watch a cute penguin movie I would look for Scamper the Penguin movie from the mid 1990s. That is a great penguin movie.Scamper the Penguin"
5,I love this movie!,"I have to admit that I bought this movie for myself, and make my kids love it :) They really do love it too though. The toddlers love the music, and my bigger boy loves the character. I love the music. Its a great family movie, and it will be watched over and over!"
2,"Good movie, bad disk","The HD DVD disk I got with this movie does not have the menu (extras, title, settings, etc. are all gone). I would have returned to Amazon but did not have time."
1,Horrible and disgusting!,"My family and I thought this would be a cute movie,and from the previews it looked like it would be. But from the very beginning it had sexual undertones and clearly made fun of people of faith.The main character Mumbo seemed to be on a quest to ""enlighten'the faithful and traditional penguins. I can also bring up how they portrayed the traditional penguins as ignorant, close minded and unforgiving. There is a not so subtle message that we as humans are responsible for the disasters throughout the world. In the movie humans are refered to as ""The Annihilators."" I cannot believe it won an oscar. Must be the same people who gave Al Gore's movie an award. I would not recommend this movie for anybody. It was a horrible and disgusting display of political propeganda."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER MADE ! 0 OUT OF 10,"Within the first few minutes of watching Happy Feet I was screaming it was so bad . This movie features the worst music ever, known as R&B. I wanted to go and impale myself on the nearest sharp object throughout the entire movie. The movie doesn't do anything to revitalize the movie industry, it's just another crappy animated movie like Chicken Little and Meet the Robinsons. No part of this movie was enjoyable and it felt like I was being mind-raped in my music and movie tastes section.Well,I didn't kill myself from the agony of this movie, but I better not go near any penguins because I now have the urge to beat the living crap out of a penguin for every bad penguin movie I see."
2,Um....Yeah....,"....three children (2, 6, & 7) walked away from the large screen surround sound TV about 20 minutes into this movie. We should have rented it instead of making the purchase of the DVD."
1,Boring feet,"I found this to be very boring. Most of the characters looked alike. No diverse characters like a polar bear, seal other animal than a penguin ect.The plot was extremely weak, basically a penguin tries to stop humans from eating fish in the antarctic.With the exception of ONE funny scene, the rest of the movie got boring fast.The movie was cute for 3 minutes and just dragged on until the revelation of the ridiculous plot. Preachy anti religious and just plain boring.It tried so bad to be a Disney movie but sunk beneath the ice on this one.It was propaganda disguised as a kid's movie.Go get Ice Age instead."
3,More than Happy Feet,"I could hardly wait for this DVD as I do not go to the movies. I was expecting a nothing but Happy movie - this was no Shreik- I think a movie geared tward Childen should be nothing but happy sillyness- leave the moral messages to Al Gore, I actually found the movie more sad than Happy, yes there are some great scenes which made me smile but too many hidden messages which probably went over most little kids heads. Some I hope did. Too deep to be a fun movie for me. Bring back funny goofy kids movies like Toy Story or Shreik."
1,Absolutely Dreadful!,What's with all of the sexual innuendo in a kids show? I thought the music was horrible and the story was a real snoozer. This movie actually put me in a bad mood. My 4 year old daughter was bored to tears and stopped watching after 10 minutes.
3,DVD came damaged,This isn't a review about the movie itself but the fact it wouldn't play on one of our DVD players.
4,"Good, yes. Best animated feature, nope.","Happy feet started out strong, a penguin who doesn't fit in uses his special ability to overcome adversity. Nice plot line. Halfway into the film I was trying to understand how it beat out Cars - arguably Pixar's best effort yet - for best animated feature. Once I saw the environmentalist conclusion then I understood.Nice CGI, again not as good as Cars. Felt like it was longer than it needed to be."
5,"Great movie, very fun, and the message was simple","I thought the movie was very entertaining as well as my 7 year old daughter. The old tunes made new again made it enjoyable to me, and as far as my daughter is concerned these were all new songs to her. The message part I felt wasn't as deep as it appears to have others thinking. My daughter got out of it a simple we need to care for the environment because what we do doesn't just effect us. Thats all she understood, which is good. As an adult, to me expressing the already obvious in manner in which children can understand. I took it for being positive and fun at the same time. Political? No."
5,Happy Feet,This is an outstanding film for all the family. A lesson in the gifts of the non-conformist and what they have to give to the world. Delightful!!!
5,Awesome!!,"I really loved this movie, it was AWESOME from the beginning to the end. I am not a big fan of animated movies but this one tops the cake. My daughter can't seem to watch it enough, I think I will need to order another copy just to keep at the house because my daughter takes her Happy Feet everywhere. No matter how many times I watch it, it always feels like it's the first time."
3,Excellent Music,"We were a little surprised that the story line wasn't stronger. The build up for Happy Feet was overwhelming - perhaps our expectations were too high. The music, however, was beautiful. There is something for everyone. I'm sure younger people will want to see it again and again."
2,"Lots of Al Gore, lttle story","The movie was an environmental film that tried hard to get in a message with little story being the result. I gave it 2 stars just because the ""latino penguins"" added a small bit of much needed humor.Basically a penguin gets exiled by the leading ""pastor penguin"" because he dances and in his journey he discovers how mankind are destroying the planet. He then dances for the humans and their hearts begin to open to the fact that they should stop fishing and stealing all the penguins fish.And that's about it."
4,I ENJOYED IT!!!!!!!,"I thought this movie was very interesting. The messages were well placed and the music was great. I felt the message about the environment was possibly too much for children, but I think this movie was really good overall."
1,Penguin Porn,"So very boring, full of innuendo, absurd story, & soooo very long! And the sexuality! I mean, really, the penguins are getting it on! How can a director who can make such a fantastic variety of movies (Mad Max & Babe) make this turkey? The trailers & commercials for this movie were totally misleading. It doesn't just stick to the social misfit plot. I was shocked it got an oscar nod and worse, won over two vastly superior movies, Cars and Monster House. MH should have won!!!! I would have given this one a razzie, if they had an animated category. See Surf's Up instead of this if you're a penguin lover."
1,Awful,The only reason why I stayed and watched the movie the whole way through was because I paid to see it. Awful movie. Not entertaining at all. It was just so poor. The animation wasn't fantastic. Political messages shouldn't be in children movies. Not a good movie.
1,Not meant for children,"I was horribly disappointed by the first two minutes of this film. Why only the first two minutes? Because that is all that I watched. I rented it to watch with my five-year-old daughter, for I had heard great things about this film. Well, the movie opens with a female penguin singing a song by Prince,... ""you don't have to be beautiful to turn me on... All I want is your body from dusk till dawn...."" In the background, the male panguing are singing, ""Let's talk aboue Ex, baby,"" to the tune of, you guessed it, let's talk about sex, baby. I felt this was very inappropriate for children. My husband stopped the DVD and we didn't even watch it.And, yes, I am very protective of my children and what they watch, but if I don't do it, who will?So, if you worry about the sexual inuendo's that have the ability to influence your children, I reccomend finding something different to watch."
2,"Happy Feet, Sad flick",After all the hype and advertising that I saw on TV I thought it was a winner. Much to my dismay rather than a winner it was a wiener. After 15 minutes of this animated wonder I was bored. I have tried to watch it over a number of times and still fall asleep before it's half over. I will admit that the animation was well done but the plot was stupid and seemed to go on forever getting nowhere.
3,Happy Feet (Full Screen Edition),"Happy Feet (Full Screen Edition) is an OK animated movied. The story line is about mumble a penguin that dances but can not sing. In penguin society everything is based on how you sing. Because of this he is seen as different and an outcast. The message to accept others is a good one. However, then the move starts with an overtly political message about evil humans and good animals. A children's movie should not deal with politics. The voice acting is great and Elijah Wood is great as Mumble. Still an OK movie. 3/5."
3,rent it - don't buy it,"My girls, ages 4 and 8, love this movie and have watched it over and over since they got it as a gift earlier this year. My girls love to sing. The problem is they have recently been hooked on one song from the movie that I don't care to hear them sing. It's ""Let's Talk About Ex"". Come on, really now, was it necessary to use that song in a kid's movie? Don't get me wrong, I, as an adult, love the original Salt-N-Pepa song ""Let's Talk About Sex""; this is the same song without the ""S"", it's just ridiculous!! My 4 year old is wandering around the house singing ""Let's talk about ex baby, let's talk about you and me, let's talk about ex."" Hopefully they soon tire of it. My advice...rent it, don't buy it."
2,Happy Feet,The best part of this movie was when the little pengiun was dancing. This movie is to advanced for small children.
1,Not worth watching twice,"I have three kids that will watch a movie over and over again, even if the movie is not that good. Not once have they requested to watch this one again. We watched it once.To be fair, I caught it about halfway through when my kids were watching it, and I stood with my hands on my hips trying to figure out what the movie was about. Once I figured it out...I didn't like it. Stinky.I am annoyed that even though I read many of the negative reviews on Amazon, I still bought it. I just don't think that the way it was marketed was fair. It's not a feel good story with dancing penguins. It's a bummer. Okay, done.Good animation, though. 1.5 stars."
1,Not for little kids...or grown ups,"I bought this movie for toddler, although I had heard that the story was not good, I though she would like the music and the dancing (she loves music) I was sooo wrong! I was expecting either catchy kidie songs or the musical type. Instead the soundtrack consists of great classics, but manny of them are not appropiate for little children and most are butchered with arrangemets ""ala Chistina Aguilera"".Besides that, some characters seem to sexualized and, is it my imagination or Mumble really slaps Gloria on the but while dancing?.I am not a conservative, but I found this movie to have messeges and/or portails of intolerance, indolence, bad parenting, sexualized behavior and stereotyping, among other things.And besides, the story is bad."
1,Dreadful,"It's official: I cannot stand films for children anymore; if wasn't made before 1975, I'm not watching it.""Happy Feet"" left me almost gasping; I thought it would never end. The songs, the singing, the gospel choir cacophany of it all - all very Mariah Caryish - left my head pounding. Most appalling, are the sexual inuendos; unlike in nature, you could identify the female penguins by their gyrating hips. Entertainment for the whole family? Why? Films should made, unapologetically, to delight children. Period. Enough with the double entendres, the ""adult"" humour, the political jabs, etc. Ditto for the ""message"" that always has to be there: Save the fish! Don't be mean! Don't judge! Let's all shed a tear for poor little happy feet and his annoying tap dancing!Give me old Walt Disney or Warner Bros. over this crap anyday."
1,Amazon unbox poor quality,"I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox. I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo. It was very disappointing. The picture was little on my high def screen. It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen. I even tried changing the aspect on my television. No improvement. Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup."
1,Dull and just wrong,"Children's movies are NOT the forum for adult propaganda. Children do not have the capacity to see the lop sided message for what it is, and they become overly emotional and fearful. Save the sermon for appropriate venues. Sucking parents into a theater with their children expecting to see a fun, happy movie and then shoving a viewpoint on them and scaring the hell out of the kids is inappropriate and irresponsible.In addition, I was bored to death. This is just anothe sappy rerun of a long list of gooey gunk. Small children will be fascinated by the dancing and singing litte penguins (until the horror of the evil humans show up). Adults and older kids will sit there rolling their eyes."
2,not so happy feet,"I was excited about this one coming out. I love the cast, great actors. It is very slow to start and is kinda mind-numbing! Starts to get better once Robin Williams' character comes in because before that there is not even an attempt at a laugh. Not much in the form of a villian either. Not thrilled by the choice of music, not the normal great selection as with other cartoon favorites! I did however like the integregration of live action with the rest of the animation without looking roger rabbity about it. Overall a snoozer and not worth the time. Rent, don't buy!!"
5,"It was wonderful,Very cute","This HappyFeet movie, was a Gift for my Grandson,on his birthday.He watches it every chance he can get."
4,Cute! Cute!,"Touching story line! Thourghly enjoyed this movie! My husbands grandkids loved it, too! We all have the movie! The music is catchy and makes you want to stomp your feet right along with the penguins!"
5,Adorable for all ages!,"When this was in the theaters, I had a friend warn me that the sea lion scene would scare my 3-yr. old daughter too much. Not whatsoever! It didn't faze her one bit and she continued to watch and ADORE this movie. It is consistantly in our DVD player and played more than any movie she has! Absolutely a wonderful adorable movie!"
2,Happy Feet,"This picture was cute with the animation, but was much too slow in developing the story plot. Interest was lost in a number of places, although the over all idea was good."
2,Unsure of who the target audience is supposed to be,"I really enjoyed the first half of Happy Feet (except for the very annoying ""Norma Jean"" Nicole Kidman character). The animation is great, the penguins were delightful and the story was progressing nicely then all of a sudden we have a shift to propaganda for environmental causes, our hero imprisoned and going slightly mad and being down trodden by his own tribe once again. I finished watching this movie wondering who it was targeted at and feeling far from happy, almost depressed. Not a kid's movie at all."
2,Happy feet not so happy,"I wanted to watch this since it was on the theaters. Now I am just wondering what all the excitement was about. This is a rather dark film. It doesn't have the happyness, joy, or even sadness of the first Toy Story. It's just a dark moody film. There is very little time when you think something good will actually happen.On the good side, the human faces were some of the best done (unless they were real faces) in computer animation.The movie also looks good on HD Tivo. Unfortunately Amazon still doen't have very many animated movies. I would highly reccomend any of the ICE AGE movies more than this."
4,Excellent....,"First, this movie may be appreciate by kids, but its really made for bigkids, which will understand and appreciate it more. Great music, greatcharacters will entertain you with this eye candy of a movie. I did'ntknow what to expect, and viewing it at 23:00 it had to be good. By thetime the movie ended, i could'nt go to bed...cause my feet were dancing."
1,Caution: Not for young kids!,"To those who say a PG rating should be enough to warn parents, my daughter loves tap dancing and this film was marketed in such a way as to appear to be ""harmless fun"" aimed at little kids. Fortunately, we only borrowed this movie from the library...but our 4 year old said ""no - I don't want to watch it - it is too scary!"" Turns out she had already seen it in pre-school, and she was right - it is not a movie for young kids. My wife and I watched it after putting our daughter to bed, and while it might not be too scary for older kids, this is nothing I'd go out of my way to expose my kids to. There are many dark aspects to this film, and we found it a waste of time at best! If you still want to check it out, save your money and do it at a library instead!"
3,Not for children?,"I bought this movie without reading any reviews, I just assumed it was a kid's movie. So I bought it for my 2 year old daughter. But the movie is not really a kid's movie... More for adults I think. The plot & the music all seem to be adult related. But my daughter likes it anyway, for the penguin babies. :) I did not enjoy the movie."
2,Ok overall,"It was a good plot but I personally don't think that there should be that much sexual content in a children's movie. It was an ok movie overall but if I had kids, I wouldn't let them watch it."
4,Thumbs up,"Good video to have and collect, especially if you have kids. The HD quality is the actual selling point on this and you are not gonna get dissapointed. My 2-year old son loves it and everytime the penguins dance, he goes along with them. It also has a special feature on how to tap dance like Mumble in the movie."
1,Just not that great a movie,PROS1. Good guy wins in the end.2. Underdog wins (love that)3. Interesting conceptCONS1. Overt Green Peace overtones2. A little slow paced3. Music choices seem odd to me
2,Part 2 MUCH BETTER,Kinda dissapointed in this movie. I watched part 2 first with my 18 yr old daughter. We got so excited that we rented this from AMAZON. Never have I ever said a part 2 of a movie was better than the first..... theres a first for everything!!! HAPPY FEET 2....
2,"It's a cute show, but might feel politically charged to some viewers","While it has a good message about challenging your own beliefs, it also feels politically driven.The dancing singing penguins are fun, but it failed to keep my daughter's interest for long. This surprised me because she has an unusually strong love for penguins."
5,Happy Feet blu-ray dvd,"[[ASIN:B000W668I0 Happy Feet [Blu-ray] this blu-ray is good for family fare what with the cute characters and great music with comic relief. It tells the story that we are, all life is, interconnected in vast ways that can be life threatening when we foolishly fool with nature's food change. Not recommended for very young without parent's approval!"
5,Positive messages. Highly entertaining. Love it.,"I'm usually not too big on kids movies, especially animated ones, but this one is different. Just had to get it for the grandkids. Great messages on ecology, diversity, perserveance, and being true to yourself and what you believe in. I love the characters, & of course the music and dancing."
5,CAN YOU FEEL IT?,"This movie was amazing! I am in awe over an animated film that made me FEEL the music with every song that was sung and every step that was tapped. I could see Savion Glover in every dance move Mumble made. That was amazing! The music mix was outstanding (the youngsters with their ""Heart Songs"" and the elders with their ancient chants). On top of all of that, I loved the messages (old school vs. new approaches, accepting people for who they are and what they have to offer, save our environment and the creatures that dwell here, etc.). If you DO NOT like R&B; and soulful moves, THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU. It is a MUSICAL ANIMATION WITH A MESSAGE not the all out drama that warrants all of the expert movie critic reviews that have been given here (musicals aren't for everyone, some people don't really appreciate animation, and some people just hate getting a message). Enjoy the entertainment.P.S. HD is the best way to watch this movie. It brings everything to life."
4,happy feet,The music and singing is great. This movie kept my attention and think this movie is for any age.
5,Happy Feet,"A little long for my 2 yr old g'daughter, but she loves it and has already started singing the songs. She even knows the ""scairy parts"" and says the ""shark"" is bad-it's a large sea lion. Some parts are a little too intense for her."
3,Cute but preachy,"The movie is cute enough and thankfully kept the attention of my kids for almost the full two hours. But I am so tired of movies that preach to me -- and this movie is one of the preachiest I've seen in a while. Yes, ALL humans are evil and destroying our environment even as we speak.... Ugh!"
3,"Great CGI, but very boring storyline...","This is one of the great examples of excellent CGI, and blu-ray transfer. But, I find the movie kind of boring. I have tried this movie on couples of kids with various ages. They seem to have very similar response..."
1,Horrible for children,"My children are too young to have 'gotten' any of the many sexual songs and remarks, but I was watching in amazement and shocked that a children's movie could be so dirty. Needless to say, we didn't finish watching the movie..."
1,Totally misleading,"I absolutely hated this movie because of blatant environmental message. I actually agree with the message they're trying to give, but they've done it completely wrong. I felt like they tricked me into watching it. The movie was advertised as a fun kids movie. Read the description, watch the trailer, and you'll expect a normal, fun movie. There's no hint that the entire movie is about how humans are destroying the environment. If I wanted to see that I'd watch a documentary.It seems people do love they animation. If you want to see brilliant animation with an appropriate balance an actual plot and an environmental message I'd recommendWall-Einstead."
1,Weird,"This movie I thought was good in the beginning and interesting. It just started getting weird and the story was strange, he helps restore the fish because he can dance. It was just strange. Bluray was cool though."
2,Happy Feet,"Not as good as the previews made it look. Didn't even finish watching it. And BTW I ordered it from numberone101 and he never sent it, so I ordered it elsewhere.Amazon did return my money. I feel much better about Amazon and know that they stand by thier A-Z guarantee."
2,It had potential to be great....,"I love computer animation in all their glory, Shrek, Ice Age, Finding Nemo, all great movies. So you see the package of this movie, it's about penguins, and you see that it won an Academy Award, sounds good right? Nope, the movie was a huge disapointment and was completely politcally based. I'm not against being ecologically minded, but I was surprised that the theme of the movie was environmental concerns and I wonder if that may be the reason of receiving an award."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Cute movie. Good for the whole family. Robin Williams is great in it. The thing I liked about this one is that there weren't too many gags, as a lot of family films have. Just good music, and a great story line. Enjoy this one! :)"
1,HAPPY FEET IS CORNY.,"I RENTED THIS TO WATCH WITH MY SON. WE BOTH KNOW IT'S GARBAGE. ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT. PRINCE... WHY DID YOU LET YOUR TUNES BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CORNBALL STUFF? STRAIGHT GARBAGE. READ A BOOK OR GO TO THE PARK WITH YOUR KIDS INSTEAD. AS FOR THE ADULTS... IF HAPPY FEET REALLY WOKE UP OR ASSISTED YOUR REALITY WITH IT'S ""MESSAGE""... I DON'T EVEN NEED TO SPEAK ON THAT... DO YOUR THING."
3,Not for my 3 yr old grandson,It is so scary in parts that he runs and hides. It is way too intense for the very young
2,Sexual Content Warning,"I'm 46, just using the kid's review.Like other reviewers here, I didnt care for the large ammount of sexual content in Happy Feet. But before I begin: Happy Feet is about a baby penguin who was dropped as an egg, eventually hatching with a damaged songvoice but great dancing talent.This is the part that I particularly did not like: In a scene shortly after Mumble and Gloria have grown up, they are shown sliding on the ice landing on each other in a variety of sexual poses, ending with Mumble...in the usual mating position on Gloria's back. I didn't mind the songs too much, but this scene just went too far. The kids got what was going on as well. I was so embearassed.This is not the only scene in Happy Feet that hinted (not too subtly either) at sexual content. I hope this review helps."
1,Terrible!,"I don't think I've ever hated a movie as much as I hated this. Heavy-handed, all over the place with the message it was trying to convey, and just plain stupid. I also have a problem with a movie that advertises as a light little romp about dancing penguins that veers into ""Save the World from Humans"" junk. It was like Sybil, but less endearing. A waste of time. Now I think Cars was robbed even more at the Oscars."
1,denigrating,"This movie had a few cute bits, but it denigrated many groups of people...if you are interested, even a bit, in information about penguins, see ""March of the Penguins""....oh, and none of them are cholos or members of the rabid religious right. I watched the video, and was hurt by the racism that I saw."
1,Very Disappointing Propaganda,Save the Whales!! and the penguins!! curse oil !!That's the premise and it stunk.
4,"Not your Average Animation Movie, but cute and entertaining!","It's a movie with a message!It's a movie about the environment!It's a ""musical"" whether you asked for it or not!Didn't I say: It's not your average animation movie?Try renting at Netflix or Blockbuster before you buy.Stunning picture! and a nice animation movie. It's not what you'd expect from a regular animation though. I like it especially the adorable little baby penguin.""A great HD DVD transfer, very bright and colorful!"
2,Great animated feature!,"Happy Feet is a wonderful animated feature film which will entertain any child from age 4 through 95! The story is heartwarming and the animation is breathtaking. The voice work by the cast is pretty good as well. I heartily recommend this movie, especially in its HD DVD form. The HD DVD picture is spectacular and reveals every fine detail of the penguins and their environment. A must-own for HD DVD fans!!"
1,simply a propaganda tool,"The entire purpose of this movie is to highlight to children (and the child-like) ""Humans bad, animals good."" The ideology that humans are the scourge of the planet saturates this movie.It goes way overboard on anthropomorphism and shows humans with few redeeming qualities.I am horrified that I actually spent money on this propaganda."
1,"Yup, it's that bad.","Where is the zero stars option? Is it possible to ""unwatch"" a movie? I actually felt embarrassed for the people who made this movie. Even my wife, who never reads politics into movies and just enjoys them, thought it was a heavy-handed propaganda piece. I really can't think of any redeeming quality from this film to put on the plus side, other than the penguins being cute. But you can see that in ""March of the Penguins"" while enjoying the natural world and avoiding all the proselytizing. This is the only DVD we've thrown away rather than donate it to the local library; we didn't want to inflict it upon anyone else."
5,its not that serious,"This movie was extremely funny!!. There were a lot of adult humor, but they do that in a lot of movies so the adults dont get bored watchin it. I think that the whole propaganda is a stretch too far. The thing with the aliens (humans) was a good part of the plot. THe other penguins thought because he was different he was causing the food to go away. I think that people take these movies a little bit too seriously, its just a movie. And i think this was a great cartoon movie/comedy. And the tapping was amazing!!!!!!!!"
5,Happy Feet (animation),The movie was really good and a great presentation for high school students to understand differences in personalities and creative aspects in teens and adolescents.
3,somewhere in the middle,I know they were trying to cash in on the market of penguins as the popular animal thanks to march of the penguin and I do think there were a fair amount of funny parts. However yes if you're trying to stick to realistic animation there are a great deal too many unrealistic and totally illogical plot holes to it. Like why would the zoo just turn loose a phenominal tap dancing penguin with a tracking device rather than keep him as a star money making attraction? I was fond of Mumbles from the start. As to the music choices ok We all expose kids to pop music at an early age. so we have little right to complain about this movie doing the same. I've seen and heard worse on primetime and even cartoon network and disney channel. I at 30 found this an interesting and entertaining near 2 hours of mindless drivel.
1,Most boring animated film I have seen.,"This film failed to grab my attention. Impressive visuals can't hide the fact that this movie is terrible. The plot is mediocre (singing penguins discriminate a dancing penguin, LAME.) No memorable characters. The adult penguins are ugly,especially in HD, they could have at least made them ""cute"". The main character (dancing penguin)lacks charisma. The voice acting is bland and uninspiring, it's as if the actors are reading from the script instead of acting it out. Any Disney animated film would put these voice actors to shame. And it would've been nice if the penguins performed songs made specifically for the film ala Disney, but it seems like the Happy Feet songs are borrowed from the radio. I hate to be comparing this to Disney. But Disney is the gold standard by which all others are measured by."
5,"AWESOME, ALOT OF FUN !!!","I DON'T KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE REVIEWS ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. SO UPLIFTING WITH THE MUSIC, MY CHILDREN WERE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. AS FOR THE UNDERTONES, WHAT MOVIE THIS DAY DOES NOT HAVE AN UNDERTONE, AND THE WHOLE THING ABOUT MAN BEING BAD FOR RUINING THE PENGUINS FOOD SUPPLY WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. YES, WE AS MANKIND CAN WRECK ANIMALS HABITATS, THATS NOTHING NEW AND SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED, AND ITS ONLY US, THE ADULTS THAT REALLY CATCH ON TO IT. AS FOR MUMBLES BEING GAY, THATS RIDICULOUS. IT TEACHES A VALUABLE LESSON ABOUT BEING DIFFERENT. MY 5 YR OLD ACTUALLY THOUGH MUMBLES WAS SO BRAVE, AND HE'S RIGHT, HE WAS. MY SON GOT NOTHING BUT POSITIVE THINGS FROM THIS MOVIE, I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT, FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS ADULTS. I ADORE THIS MOVIE. GOOD BUY !!!!!"
1,Horrible movie,"First, this movie is boring. Second, the music lyrics are not appropriate for children - unless sexual innuendo is what you deem appropriate for children. Lastly, the move is anti-religious. I am an atheist, yet I found the overt anti-religious message of this film to be a real turn off. The films message is ""don't believe in what your elders believe. Don't trust your gods""."
3,"Amiable, but that's about it","""Happy Feet"" is an amiable little movie, a slight good-natured bit of animation. And the animation is spectacular, as review after review has attested. The technical achievements of ""Happy Feet"" are noteworthy, including the sound. If you have a subwoofer, it will get a workout during some scenes.But as review after review has also attested, there is no story here. If you like plot, you will be sadly disappointed. I turned to my wife at the 30 minute mark into the movie and said that I still didn't know what the story was, and she didn't either. This movie may be good for very little kids, who will enjoy the animation and singing and dancing and don't have any demands or expectations about plot. But, older children and adults are likely to be looking at their watches well before the ending wondering when this overly-long film will end.This is at least worth a rent for families with young children."
3,Not What I Expected.,I was expecting a more kid friendly movie and was somewhat disappointed. Most of the dialogue was over their heads and they eventually wandered off without watching the movie. I do not recommed this movie for young kids.
1,A Terrible Waste of Time,"I really enjoy good animation, and I own nearly everything on the market. But Happy Feet is a terrible piece of work and I regret wasting the time I spent watching it. In essence, I think they are trying to fry too many fish at one time."
1,Very sad!!!!!!!,"I receive the movie yesterday and I can't see the movie in serting pont got stack and didn't work after that.I always buy use and new movies from Amazone I never had any problems, this is my second problem...... please can you fix my problem, I bought this movie to be a gift for Christmas, I would really appreciate!Thank youJilma"
5,Children love this one,"This too should be a must-see for every child. Another wonderful movie that is enjoyed by many, young and old."
4,"""A entire teaching""",A lesson for the whole family ... Poignant and very important to understand what humanity does to the rest of the species on earth...
2,Keep Your Politics OUT Of My Kids' Movies!,"It was initially cute... a sweet little creature with big eyes takes your heart by storm, but the end was a huge disappointment. Look, if you want to push some political agenda, do it somewhere OTHER THAN a movie for children. Please. Just let us enjoy a movie with the kids without having to deal with people's political agendas. This is a kid's movie. Stop tainting good movies with agendas. Thanks."
2,Boring and Annoying,If you need some sleep buy this movie...totally for the 5 yr old and under. No where near as good as Ice Age etc.
2,my son didn' care for this movie,and neither did i. it was boring from begining to end. i think it was a good deal but is not an original so for that it shouded cost only 1 dollar
4,Funny and sweet,"ok, first of all, those of you who didn't think this movie was funny must have dry senses of humor. As far as Mumble's difference in appearance, it's plausible that when his egg was dropped it affected his physical development too. Plus this is FICTION!!! Didn't anyone who watched this have an imagination? It's not supposed to be real! As for the mixture of themes, I find a little bit of everything pretty satisfying, given my mood. Anyway, I really enjoyed watching the movie. I just wish I hadn't read what other people thought, cause they're just dripping with negativity...Maybe I should go watch Happy Feet again!"
2,Kiddie Indoctrination,"I'll start with the positive: The animation is great and a visual treat. Now the bad news: This movie is an excuse to expose kids to sexual themes (inappropriate songs & situations) and the ""humans are the problem"" philosophy. Besides that it's just not a very good movie. We've seen this kind of preachy stuff before."
2,Bad bad bad,"The voices are difficult to understand, most of the dialogues are meaningless to the young audience. Adult penguins are creepy (young ones are cute, though). Penguin eyes look like they are made of glass. Overall a very disappointing experience watching this movie."
3,Happy Feet is for the kids,I was very disappointed with the video.I had waited quite a while for it to come to the stores. It was not at all what I had expected.It is definitely for little children.
2,"Way Too Fuzzy Wuzzy ""Let's Save The Animals"" Movie","First of all, don't get me wrong, I'm all for saving the animals and humans on Earth - it is all we have at this time to leave for our children to live on.. But, to try and say that 'Happy Feet' was simlpy a cute little kids movie, was way off base. I am not sure little ones even understood the simple plot of ""Everyone, if they are different, are ok"". Let alone the larger plot of we are destroying the land and outer lying lands of animals, causing problems we didn't know about, and we need to become more aware. Yeah, the little kids really understood that!! I think it was too long, too PC - just too P period. I think its sad that I have to see politics in movies that I wanted to enjoy with my kid for a couple hours. So, no I wasn't thrilled with the overly Fuzzy Wuzzy Save The Animals Movie."
3,I was a little Underwhelmed,"I watched this movie for the first time with my 5 year old daughter.She had seen it in the theater and loved it. So, I bought it for her when it was released on DVD. It might have been targeted at a younger audience but I was expecting something similar to Cars, or Shrek. I was disappointed. If you want a movie to play for the lids great. But for me I will watch Cars again and leave Happy Feet in the drawer."
3,a little too enviro for my tastes...,"the animation was wonderful and the charactors were very cute, but it seemed like the creators forced too many enviromental messages into the movie. don't get me wrong. i appreciate nature and am aware of the problems we're having with global warming and the like, but when i go to a movie, i prefer to be entertained. it almost felt like they were jamming it down our throats.given the choices of films that were presented at the oscars, i would've chosen 'cars' hands down for its entertainment value..."
4,a lot of fun,"sweet little movie about expressing yourself and respecting others. cute. would recommend it to you, especially if you have kids in the audience."
5,Great Family Movie,I love this. And so does my 6 month old daughter now. She has been watching this from the time she was 1 month old. :D
5,Excellent music and animation,This animated musical was Amazing to watch. The impressive movements and musical renditions kept me wonderfully entertained thoughout the entire movie! Finding a family friendly movie that is so fantasically positive for children and adults alike is a special treat. I would recommend this movie to everyone.Garie Thomas-BassAuthor of the book:Purposeful (Not Random) Acts of Kindness: (AKA Beginning Steps for Overcoming Spoiled Brat-aholism)
1,Uneccesarily Racist For a Family Film,"I was incredibly dissapointed by the producers of this movie by them insensitively incorporating the ""Hollywood Latino stereotype"" for the other Penguins. It was incredibly uneccesary and racist. Just because the penguins are from Argentina they must speak that way and its appropriate?I find it unfortunate that a family film can have such insensitive images of a group of people. This movie is trying to make it seem that all people who speak Spanish act the same way.Had this movie had monkeys from Africa speaking in jive..EVERYONE would be up in arms, and this movie does exactly that with Spanish people."
5,Awesome Penguin movie,"This is one of my favorite movies. My 6 year old and I watched it probably 50 times, no exaggeration. The look of this movie is really impressive. It doesn't look like a cartoon, it looks real. The penguins look real. It actually looks like real penguins talking, singing, and dancing, and of course walking around and swimming, etc. Penguins are beautiful animals. A lot of things in the movie are factual. The way they care for the egg, and how the males huddle in the cold dark antartic with the egg on their feet, and take turns on the outside of the huddle, etc.Most of the movie takes place in Antartica, and just a bit where Mumble finds himself in a zoo.I thought the movie also had some really good ""messages"", and not just the environmental one."
4,i love this movie,"...i never seen so many harsh ratings on a ""children's movie""...anyway, look on youtube for a trailer and see if you want to buy it.i just want to inform all parents that this is DEFINITELY not a children's movie. some things will go over their head but it has plenty of sexual references [small and big].it didn't both me at all but i was working at a movie theater when this came out and i was thinking ""wow...all those kids in there and they said that/ did that?""just a heads up."
3,Cute for older kids,I bought this when my kids were 4 and 3 and they would watch it for a few minutes and then get bored and want to watch something else. I don't think we have ever played it to the end. I think it might be for a little bit older children. Mine don't ask to watch it so I figure I'll pull it back out in a couple of years and try again.
2,Penquins Overdone,"Overall, this movie was okay. It didn't get even the least bit interesting until the final half of the movie. Although not as bad as Surf's Up, I think it is not as good as some of the other animated movies."
3,Disappointed!,"I specifically ordered this movie for my niece in college as a valentine's day gift. It was to be a study break movie. I chose this company because it said new, sealed package, as from the factory. This is not what I received! The package was inserted in the mailer with the broken seal end inserted in the envelope mailer first. So when you opened the package, it appeared new and the seal appeared unbroken. This is not what the product claim was and not what I ordered. The price was good, and I am familiar with the movie, but I ordered a new copy! I did not have time to return it and order another copy, so I kept it, but I will never order from this vendor again! Why try to be deceptive, and think you can fool the consumer, as if I would not notice the way it was packaged? Bah! Humbug! Shame on you!"
3,happy feet indeed,"fabulus,extraordinary !excellent picture.if the audio was uncompressed it would be fantastic for the sound also!"
1,Movie is great fun - DVD was defective,"I wanted to share this with my daughter when she got home and we were greatly disappointed to find the DVD HD side was completely defective. Our HD player refused to read it saying it was blank (other HD products have played just fine). The regular side played fine.Since we were past the 30 days return time (my daughter was away from home for the summer), Amazon refused to replace the defective disc - turning a fun movie choice into a dissatisfaction with Amazon as a whole.I recommend the movie but be leery of defective burns."
1,Crappy Feet.,"I don't even want this film in my house. It's inappropriate for small kids. It's sexual, scary, depressing, political, racial, discriminatory, boring, insulting, annoying, disturbing ... did I say depressing? The tapping sound doesn't even match the motion of their feet. I can't wait for the images to leave my brain. I hope my four year old isn't permanently damaged."
2,Disappointing,"The first part of the movie was fun, with lots of great singing. The second half beats you over the head with a bludgeon telling us how bad people are. Now, I guess, the enviros don't want us to eat fish. I wanted my money back."
2,NOT for kids!,"Obviously, this movie is rated ""PG"" for a reason. They state ""some mild peril and rude humor"" as the reasons.From the get-go, it is inappropriate. One of the first lines: A penguin, singing, ""You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on.""The movie is laced with other songs that I do not want my child to hear (such as, ""Let's Talk About Sex""). Not to mention the fact that there are questionable ideas about religion and authority figures.I don't mind political movies, but it was not even hinted at what-so-ever in the previews what this movie is *really about.*Hollywood markets these movies towards children when they are not appropriate for them.Aside from that, it wasn't even a good movie for adults. Animation was great, but the movie was not put together well.Bottom line: If you don't want to cover ears or explain things about sex or politics, don't take the kids (or buy this!)."
3,"Man bad, penguins good. We get it.","I thought this would be a family movie, but it's pretty dark in some places.I am still not sure what the humans in the movie were doing to hurt the penguins. Something about nets, I take it. It's a sloppy mess of environmental accusations that are never made clear.On the plus side, the animation was, for me, jaw-droppingly good, as was Savion Glover's work on the dance scenes. The revelation for me was Brittany Murphy, whom I've liked since she played Tai in ""Clueless."" She can actually sing! Best voice of the film, speaking or singing.So if you don't mind a murky ""green""-ish message but love to watch good animation, check out ""Happy Feet."""
5,Grandkids love it!,My Grandchildren aged 3 & 2 love this movie. They even stand in front of the TV and try to tap dance with the penguins.
5,Good Comedy,"I saw this movie yesterday.It is going to be a big box office hit. The cast is great while Britany Murphy, Nicole Kidman,Robin Williams,Elijah Wood and many others achieve high performances throughout this film. This movie will bring smiles to children's faces all over the world. For the Adults it will bring the iner-child out of you. Go and see it because you will be pleased along with many other people."
1,Garbage,"Read every 1 star rating for this movie and you'll see why I don't like it. The only reason I'm writing this review is to lower the star rating to help prevent people from even wanting to check it out, or to see why it is so disliked."
1,Could Have Been Good Without the SocioPoliticial Garbage,"This had all the makings of a great animated film had they stayed with the storyline and educational aspect of March of the Penguins. Unfortunately, Hollywood cannot resist poisoning the youths minds with social engineering messages. You just can't leave it alone can you people? This was a thinly veiled assault on our religious beliefs disguised as ""that's the way the old penguins think"" and showing the older penguins as paranoid control freaks. This, along with other neo-liberal brainwashing otherwise ruined what could have been a good movie for families. Instead it is a steaming pile of excrement."
1,"Fish don't have feelings, but penguins do?","As a conservationist, and a lover of movies, I was expecting a wonderful experience from watching this movie. I was sorely disappointed. The movie did wildlife a huge disservice by casting leopard seals and killer whales as little more than evil predators. Neither species is evil. Both do what they have evolved to do. Lending some moral superiority to penguins which eat fish (and hence is a predator), while not extending the same respect to seals and whales is wrong-headed at best. It confused my nephew and caused him to want to kill whales and seals. All in all, a huge waste of time. Plus the mexican slurs provided by Robin Williams should have been removed, very insensitive. Plus, I must add it also supports the sterotype of the traditional dad as little more than a close-minded fool. Avoid this like the plague. Oh, not enough music for me. Very sad!!!"
2,BORING,"This movie is slow and, for a supposedly kids' movie, it is loaded with sexual inuendo. When will movie makers learn that good movies can also be more innocent?"
2,not oscar worthy,This was an ok movie. I liked the use of the music but the plot was boring and the animation was not innovative. I feel that they could have done a much better job given all the talent out there.
2,Hmm,"I really didn't like this movie, neither did anyone else we watched it with, including the kids. There is not a lot there for kids once the cutesy animation wears off. You have the same old story of an outcast who ultimately saves the day in the end but it is a long time before you get to that point. There are some funny moments in the film and some cute acting but not a lot of it is really age-appropriate for young kids and the movie is too shallow to hold older audiences. My real complaint with the movie is that it comes across as just a thinly-veiled attempt to get an environmentalist message across. Unfortunately, it fails because the parents see right through it and the children are too young to understand it."
4,"Tap, Tap, Tap","I wish there was a little more tapping in the movie, but it was an entertaining film.The music was great, and there are many parts of this film that will keep you smiling and laughing.Stephen John Becciaauthor of The Treelanders--Journey to the Giants"
3,It's a good movie but full of political hype,"I thought it would be about a penguin who finally fit in, not about a penguin who saves the world (so to speak) from disaster. I adored the Adelie penguins (Robin Williams et al) and how the writers came up with heart songs on how penguins met their mates. But the movie had too many ""lessons to learn"" that after a while, I got tired of being fed morality. My daughter loved the music, though, and the soundtrack is awesome!"
2,made for a tall person,"bought 2, one for my brother he's 6 ft. and one for husban 5'11"". Hit them past there but. They didnt like the lenght. If a tall person were to buy it he'd like it. Its nicley made just to long."
4,Great toy but...,"My 2 year old son loves this little train. However, it was listed as age range of 2 - 5. It actually has very small parts and poses a choking hazard for children under the age of 3. I wouldn't have ordered it yet if I had realized this."
3,Yet to open,I haven't opened it yet but my mother-in-law called to tell me it was itty bitty. I sadly didnt pay attention to the dimensions.
5,Cute!,"This cute and fun toy is a must for the kids! All the kids I know simply LOVE this toy! Also, it's able to withstand kids!"
5,Creative Play,"The wooden railway trains really help open the door to creative play and imagination, which a lot of toys seem to lack with all the modern day technology. My son absolutely LOVES Thomas the Train and will play for hours alone or with friends and family. It actually helped him to enjoy playing alone too. The wooden tracks are also act like a puzzle where they can create track after track for their trains."
4,Kids love it,"The kids love this train, plus the Percy train I got with it. They have little magnet bits on the ends so the trains can stick together. The trains themselves were a little smaller than I expected, but the kids don't seem to mind, although they keep getting lost because they are so small. The toy is colorful, well-built, and the kids love it."
5,Awesome purchase!,"You can't go wrong with Thomas Wooden Railway toys. It's durable, cute, and literally hours of fun if your kid is into trains. I love purchasing them on Amazon because otherwise I'd go broke. They come promptly, are in good condition/packaging, and will last forever. You simply can't beat it!"
1,The train is soooo small!,I was so disappointed with this train. The product dimensions were completely untrue. The train itself is closer to 1 inch x 1 inch x 2 1/2 inches. It is not worth the cost!!!
5,The one and only Thomas the Tank Engine,"Thomas is great and it's so fun to pull him along the track woth Annie and Clarabel. When I make the big setes In set aside a branch line for Thomas, Percy, and sometimes Lady. Thomas is great but in order to get the experience you need Annie and Clarabel."
1,Size does matter,This thing is about the size of a pack of the gum. I was expecing something a little bigger. Be advised
2,SMALL PROBLEM,"I ordered this to for my son, and when it arrived in the mail I was shocked! It is so small! I guess I sould have read the size description better. Cute train, but not worth the money for its size."
1,TOO SMALL,the product that we got looked way too small compared to the picture. it would've helped to know the dimensions of this product.
5,very cute,would have loved it more..if i didnt have to buy it seperate from the 100 piece wooden train set..
3,Very small,My son loved this toy for about a week until he destroyed it in the bathtub. It is made of wood and the wheels are plastic. It is about the size of a baseball.
5,Great product,"I have ordered many of these and the wooden kind a very sturdy,i have liked them all and my grandchildren have gotten many hours of playtime with these,i will definitely purchase more."
1,One Word,"**SPOILERS**to describe this book would be deplorable. I HATE the main characters Diamond and the ever superficial bimbo Gwen Mati. A friend of mine raved about Tom Robbins and what a brilliant writer he is. This is the first book I read about Tom Robbins and I am thoroughly disappointed. Reading the chapter where the little superficial bimbo walks into Diamond's bathroom was a no brainer to find out that they would end up doing the nasty and I mean the ""nasty"" in every sense of the word. For a moment I felt I was reading one of those sleazy Harlequin novels. I have nothing against including sex in novels, however this was too sleazy for my taste. For me personally this book was bland and lacked context."
2,Bizarre fun that goes nowhere,"I enjoyed this crazy story while it lasted but felt unsatisfied when it was all over. Just stange in the end, although I did enjoy the ride most of the time."
2,this book is very long and drawn out,"I usually enjoy reading Tom Robbins' novels, but this one I could not even finish. I had to force myself just to get halfway through it. There is really no plot, which makes it difficult to read. I am disappointed with this book."
1,What a disappointment!,"I am an avid Tom Robbins fan..but this book was the one stinker in the bunch. The main character was so obnoxious person, I had no sympathy for her. What was interesting - albeit disappointing - was that there was a moment near the end of the book when she could have (finally) decided to do the right thing and redeem herself...but she didn't."
3,It's Okay,"I remember someone I dated reading this and so, when I came across it, I thought I'd try it and thought it'd be brilliantly funny. Mostly, though, it's kinda sad to see someone wake up one day and realize that the common way of things is not fulfilling, sometime most people never realize, admittedly. It kinda smacks of mid-life crisis and it has some cute and amusing factors but it's basically mediocre."
2,"It's not even cream, it's dream whip, gone stale and dry.","Tom Robbins' formula wears a little thin after 30 years or so. He's still the master of the surprising irreverent metaphor, but the flashy froth that was new and fun in the 60s and 70s is not enough to carry a book today. The racy humor that tweaked our interest in big-thumbed cowgirls is not sexy enough to be exciting, not sleazy enough to be pornographic. It comes off as just puerile."
3,Good... not great,"I usually only write reviews for books that I loved or entirely hated. I didn't love or hate this book, and I'm still trying to determine why everyone else loved it so much more than I did. I've only read Tom Robbins once before (Jitterbug Perfume) and found his writing absolutely amazing and his imagination extraordinary. Both of these impressions were confirmed with Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas, but I didn't really find the characters too appealing and the plot was creative but ultimately disappointing."
2,An OK Book.... a bad Tom Robbins book.,"You have seen some of the other reviews of this novel and you have read and even identified with the responses of the most passionate of the reviewers. If this wasn't a book by Tom Robbins, you wouldn't want to read more than the first couple of pages. Out of respect for the author who has previously never failed to impress you, you have trudged (or will trudge) your way through it. When it is all said and done you must admit that for a Tom Robbins novel, this one is is at the bottom of the heap..."
1,I love all Tom's books... Except this one!,I love all Tom's books... Except this one!Avoid at all costs.
5,This book is a veritable gift from Robbins,"With sentences such as: - ""As noiselessly as a paraplegic cricket..."" - ""Belford squeezes your hand and sort of coos and moos at you. He sounds like the background noise at a petting zoo."" - ""Diamond smiles. It's a raw stinging smile, like a cat scratch.""How can you not like this book? Open the novel on any page and I can guarantee there's a sentence somewhere you would want to savour like a Belgium chocolate. Robbins handles second person POV like the maestro he is. His plot and characters are as convoluted as a can of worms.This is one of the funniest, most intelligently written books I have ever read. I would give it 10 stars if I could.Thanks for the book, Robbins."
2,If you've never read Tom Robbins before...,"then might I suggest Jitterbug Perfume or Skinny Legs and All?In other words, don't start with this one. This is the latest book of his that I read and while it has its moments, metaphors and similes you never thought possible, strange characters and unique perspectives, it didn't quite grip my attention the way some of his other works have. When Robbins is at his best, he manages to tie together seemingly disparate elements be it perfume and immortality, the dance of the seven veils and missing household objects, Camel cigarettes and redheads... perhaps this connection between Timbuktu, frogs, the stock market and cures for cancer didn't quite intrigue me as much.I'll never tell anyone not to read a book, but I would advise you not to read this one first. Don't let your first impression of Tom Robbins be the wrong one."
1,what a disappointment,"""~if this book is the latest in humanist fiction, we're all in deep doo-doo. go read anything by vonnegut instead. if it comes down to a choice between reading this book and the back of a cereal box, choose the latter.""~ deserve it."
3,A 386 page comic book,"I wonder if Tom Robbins holds his readers in utter contempt. First there is the gimmicky use of second person narrative which adds nothing whatsoever to this book, which is already mostly devoid of any serious content. If Robbins is trying to thumb his nose at literary convention, his method of doing so fail utterly.Not that this book is meant to be taken seriously. Obviously this is not the case. However, hidden among the various hilarities (and the book IS funny, after all) are hints of subtleties, things left unsaid, real social commentary. But just hints, and Robbins never bothers to flesh them out. And most of those turn out to be merely bawdy jokes anyway. It seems as if Robbins is either teasing his readers or perhaps doesn't quite know what it is he's trying to say.If you're merely looking for a light, fun read, look no further. But if you expect anything else you will be disappointed."
2,You have insomnia,"You are reading a novel which describes everything in the second person, written by a fairly hip writer who is known for his brash style, and you wonder why. With each flip of the page you ponder what keeps your attention. It reads like a choose-your-own-adventure book but not nearly as fun. You develop a faint interest in Timbuktu, but you don't give a fig about any of the characters in the book and actualy start to get annoyed with several of them. You start to get sleepy, but you keep reading anyway. You want to finish this book, because you think there will be a point. Then you think about Timbuktu again and wish you had an issue of National Geographic that told you more about it."
5,No Letdowns here!,"I had never heard of Tom Robbins until a friend recommended his books. And yes, I mean all of his books. I decided to try out this one. I was wonderfully surprised! Tom Robbins way of writing is spectacular.. so descriptive and different from anything I've read before. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters in this book also. Everything.. the writing style, story line and characters all blended together for a hard to put down book."
4,"A bombastic, fast-paced, highly creative, and comical novel",Robbins takes the reader on an incredibly humorous adventure...pounding out word based comedy with dizzying rapidity and ingenious creativity. His comedic stylings are much like Sedaris and Kennedy Toole...leaving you in fits of laughter and marvelling at his ability to sculpt and string together sentences much like a composer creates music. His humor hits with rapid fire precision and is crafted with tremendous economy...lean and fit with very little excess verbage.
4,...still a good time.,"Certainly not as satisfying as Skinny Legs and All (but what is?), this book is still a good time. The ending made me scratch my head, but it's full of wonderful words and strange real-facts about the universe."
2,Disappointing,"I was a big fan of ""Another Roadside Attraction"" and ""Cowgirls,"" and wish that Robbins could rediscover the empathy and affection he had for the characters in these books. Gwendolyn, the stockbroker heroine of ""Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas,"" is fairly unlikeable, which is okay with me. A much bigger problem is what a thin character she is. And why on earth Robbins decided to use the second person voice to tell this story is completely beyond me since he so frequently slides out of Gwendolyn's perspective to deliver lengthy musings that seem far more in character with the author's sensibility than with hers. By the end, I became a weary of Robbins showing off at the expense of his characters."
5,Haalf Asleep In Frog Pajamas,"Reading even a paragraph of any Tom Robbins book is like feasting at the finest Paris restaurant. Each sentence is a luscious delight to roll around and enjoy from the entree of the meaning,to the appetizing adjectives and the adverbial side dishes. Half Asleep In Frog Pajamas is a most appropriate book today because of it's tie-in with the Stock Market and those who comandeer the marketing and selling of stocks and bonds. If one has never read a Tom Robbins novel, this is a good one to initiate a life-long love of his books. I wait patiently five to eight years to see the next book. For me, Tom Robbins is a moveable feast of fantasy and fiction woven with the tapestry of philosophy, ecology and humor. No one can make me laugh out loud like Tom Robbins. If you read one of his books, you have to go on and read them all. Like truly delectable dishes, you never get your fill."
3,My favorite line ...,"Lots of folks probably like Robbins for his take on the mystical. Although HAiFP held my interest over the role of Sirius in African cultures, I'm jaded enough to wonder how much of what he said was true and how much he made up. But I read Robbins for the bons mots. Here's what I thought was the best from Half Asleep: ""The look on his face could end three Italian operas and still have enough anguish left over to water an existentialist's lawn."""
4,A fun read,"This book is different from other Tom Robbins' books I've read, but it's still great. When I first began reading it, it took awhile for me to get into it, but after 50 pages or so I couldn't put it down. Hilarious, thought-provoking, intelligent, and bizarre. I recommend this book to anyone who likes unconventional writing and has a great sense of humor."
5,always read FORSYTH!,"If John Forsyth writes it--I want to read it! I have read that countless authors read and re-read his ""Day of the Jackal""--as a learning experience. amen!"
5,Short but Sweet,"This is My favorite Christmas Eve ghost story. Admittedly a short story, but it doesn't need to be any longer."
5,An excellent Christmas Fantasy envolving a real problem,"Having flown a vampire jet fighter myself for several years in the Canadian airforce; I feel confident that Forsyth actually flew a Vampire at some time. The details he gives of the aircraft and flying it, reveal a thorough knowledge of the aircraft. The problem around which the story revolves, was a real one, that I always feared myself, when flying the aircraft on instruments.Forsyth's mastery of the `short story', combined with his overall writing genius, mark `The Shepherd' as a Christmas treat no one should miss.The story can be read in much less than an evening and a friend of mine reads it every Christmas Eve to his family.Although I am not a mystic, I still enjoy such stories involving miracles, especially at Christmas.I hope it will be reprinted again soon."
4,A Christmas miracle.,"The legendary Frederick Forsyth uses his considerable storytelling skill to relate this short but powerful tale. A young RAF fighter pilot becomes lost in the fog on his way home for the Christmas holiday. Just as he is about to run out of fuel, another plane miraculously appears and guides him to safety.The Shepherd is a very well written, haunting short story. One that would have made an excellent episode of The Twilight Zone or perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's old series."
4,Predictable,"Although this is a good story, is predictable almost when you read half of it, and it has too many descriptions out of the main story, I think that in a small story like this one it doesn't matter if it is 10 pages shorter and you just tell the story.I think that at least once in our life we had an experience like this, not so big and maybe we didn't put attention if that happened to us, but think about the miracles in your life."
1,What rhymes with Kindle?,"I bought ""The Sheperd"", downloaded and read it in less than 40 minutes. Why, you ask? It weighs less than 100 pages, some 40% of which are photographs that don't come across on the Kindle screen. And, yes, it costs the full $ 9.99; and, no, there was nothing in the advertisement that alerted you to this fact. But now I figured out why the Amazon marketeers came up with this strange name for an eReader: it rhymes with Swindle!"
1,The life and times of Hans Holbein is quite boring,"This book was a waste of my time, the only reason i got it was to help with a research paper and it didnt help at all. I got a 50 on the paper using all the information from this book!"
4,good baseball shirt,This is a nice baseball shirt with reasonable price. It is also available in variety of colors and sizes. Great quality and comfortable materials.
1,Ghastly...,"I always hated this book. I hated when it came out and I was Susan's age, and I still hate it now. For the sole fact that they spent so much time making it seem like it was the ""right choice"" for Susan to just get over the fact that her biological parents have busted into her life with little regard for her own feelings and plan on sharing her. Did those parents have any concern for their biological child? There's a difference between making eased contact and the route they took, which comes across as irresponsible and selfish. It makes having any sympathy for this side impossible - all mine was for Susan and the wretched situation these people put her through. Finding that the text was not on my side only made it worse."
4,Sharing Susan,"Sharing SusanThe book I'm reading is about a 12 year old child and her names Susan and when she was born she got mixed with another baby the hospital was willing to pay 10,000 dollars. Susan biological parents want to see her and take her home. When Susan hears that she has been living with people that she wasn't related to. When she goes and sees her other mother and father they want to take their real child, but Susan's mom said that her name was Marlene. Susan's mom said that were child is dead a truck hit her. I think that this is a good book to read you must read this.If you like to read this is a great book for you."
4,Mixed Reaction!,"There were elements of the story I loved, especially the relationship between Susan and her best friend Clemmie, but I had difficulty identifying with the Stobbels. I had trouble believing they would really uproot Susan from the only home and family she has known for all of her twelve years, and I felt Susan's adjustment to her new family seemed a bit premature and unrealistic. Ms. Bunting tackled a difficult issue and her book is still a very good read and should provoke some great discussions."
2,Only one question,"I thought the book was a good one and amazingly well written. However I have one question, Why did Susans real parents wait until Marlene died to get Susan back? I get the impression that they had always known, or had known for a long time, that Marlene was not their daughter. Anyway, read the book, its very good. I would recommend the 'Face on the milk carton' series if you like stuff along this line."
4,Great for the hobbyist,"Great analog oscilloscope. It does everything you could expect from 1960's technology, especially for the price (oscilloscopes are really expensive). I'm not willing to shell out $1000+ for a digital scope, but I long for their features. If you just need a basic scope with simple features, this is probably the best deal you're going to find."
3,TOY FOR BEN,"The only issue I have is that I wanted MORE books/toys about BEN. There are single books about Thomas and other train names, but not BEN. This toy was for a new baby boy named Benjamin and it would have been nice to have more of a selection for BEN.Other than that, we love Thomas & Friends."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3 Mile Scream is from Canada and play something similar to Into Eternity and Lamb Of God combined i think the lead singer has 3 different singing voices which is quite amazing if you ask me the cd is incredibly punishing and melodic at times these guys will definately go far in the scene
4,It Works,"I needed to build a wall in the basement so I bought this screw gun after some research. It made hanging drywall almost too easy. I have since found many use of it around the house, replacing my electric screw driver. It is especially handy when working in tandem with my Skil drill (for pilot holes).This screw gun has a quality feel. It looks good, is light weight, and has plenty of torque. Great details include a long cord, a belt hook, and clear plastic cover on the aluminum gear case. The only drawback so far is that the clutch does not disengage fast enough unless the nose is held perfectly perpendicular to the wall surface, causing the bit to strip and make a loud noise. No big deal as the bit is kind of disposable item."
3,not a book,This was listed on line as a book with the music for this production. It in fact is a vinyl record of He Lived the good Life by Richard Wilson. I cannot play this because I do not have a record player. I would like the sheet music and words please if anyone has them.
4,Sturdy 6' Leash,"Great length, good thickness, nice and strong-my dog is only 5 months oldand she chewed the plastic wrapped around the handle (which I can remove)so the new leash looks a little old-but it works alot better than the nylon strap kind-she chews right through those. I would recommend thisleash and it's a better price than the pet store."
1,Defective,This projector worked for only 40 lamp hours before repeatedly shutting down after 15 minutes of use. The projector casing would get very hot when this happened. After speaking with a technician from INfOCUS he said it had a problem called premature shutdown and i should send it for repairs which i did and it has been working so far. I wouldn't recommend this projector because it seems to have a technical flaw.
1,Amazon sent wrong region dvd,"Although Amazon stated in the website that this dvd was available in all regions, they sent a region 2345 dvd which will not play on a usa dvd player. When I returned it and reordered a similar dvd the same thing happened. This happened three times even when I spoke personally with an amazon customer service rep and explained the problem. Even when assured that I would get the correct product I kept getting dvds that will not play on my dvd player. I have ordered a similar product from another supplier."
1,Not the Sounds of Blackness We Know and Love,"One of my favorite holiday albums is The Sounds Of Blackness' original ""The Night Before Christmas."" When I learned that there was a second holiday album by the group, I quickly purchased it, and was completely disappointed. My ""Spidey Sense"" tingled upon review of the liner notes, as it was a listing of various, ""Featuring so and so"" - not a good sign. This album attempts to reflect many different genres of music, and does it poorly. The spirituality, creativity, lessons and humor embedded in the original album is no where to be found in the sequel. I'm certain that most (if any) of the original members of the Sounds of Blackness were involved with this project. I am so disappointed that I may throw away the CD if I can't trade it in."
3,"Not the best Mary Brendan romance, but still enjoyable","I've read a few books by this author, and she writes an old-school emotionally remote, authoritative Alpha Male hero. It that's not your thing, you won't enjoy this book. Personally, I found this hero to be overly harsh and I agree with the prior reviewer that some of the interactions feel out of date. I do not have issues with ""forced seduction"" in romance, but this book took that concept a bit too far. I would recommend readers try Mary Brendan's ""Beloved Avenger"" which is a much more satisfying tale of lovers in the old-school style."
4,Space Thriller with all the Trimmings,"Zero Point has all the elements a grand science fiction thriller should have. A scoundrel who is capable and maybe not as bad as he thinks he is, a heroine who isn't just another pretty face, suspense, mystery, ACTION, and an Artificial Intelligence driven ship with personality plus! This is a well written book that grabs you right from the start. The action doesn't stop until the ending which seemed rather abrupt and sudden. Zero Point would be the great start of a series with unlimited possiblities. The author takes one turn that, should this turn into a series, needs to be corrected regarding main character's ship. All in all this was an excellent book and great read!!!"
4,A great book that suffers from a poor ending.,"I greatly enjoyed Zero Point. Great characters and plotline, with an excellent beginning and middle. The ending isn't really an ending. It's like the author ran out of space. Still an excellent book however."
3,Wrap ring,"This ring is fun to wear. It's quite nice looking. My only problem with it is that I thought it would have a pinkish cast to it. It is (as I should have realized), clear quartz in silver. It's not as noticable as I thought it would be."
1,Does NOT Include Todd Barry!,I got this because it said Todd Barry was in it - but he wasn't. I'm very annoyed.
3,Best of the Best?,Don't know how some of the Comics got onto this Best of the Best. Boring! I guess it depends on your sense of humour.
4,Amazing sound,Good choice to buy a cell phone. The product has an axcellent sound ( mp3)and the didital camera is fantastic.
3,Good Phone Bad Amazon,This phone is probably great however I never got it so I don't know. I ordered it through Amazon over a month ago. Why do they still claim that it will ship in 2 weeks?
1,Overpriced Paperweight,"I can't believe the amout of positive reviews this POS phone has recieved. Yes it takes good pictres yes it lets you surf the web, has a bunch of other neet features too, but trying doing any of that with the default sleep timer of 15 seconds, it is beyond infuriating! The phone has about 20 totally USELESS profiles to choose from but there is NO option to extend the sleep timer beyond 15 seconds. Its like building a porsche wtih a tank that only holds 2 gallons, WTF sony? Try setting your computers screen saver to 15 seconds and then pausing to ask someone for information or trying to get people into a photo.. or trying to read a webpage.... I have contacted sony about this problem and they informed me that no fix is being developed for this issue, 450 bucks down the drain..."
2,The phone went dead after less than three months...,"I bought an unlocked version of the K790a on April 27. I like it very much but yesterday, June 20, it suddenly displayed the message ""Insert SIM"" when I was trying to make a call. I turn it off, checked and cleaned the SIM card and battery contacts. Then I tried to turn it on but the phone refused to do so. A little red light in the infrared port flashes once or several times in every attempt to turn it on.I am not giving one star but two as a guy called Jairo of Sony Ericsson's technical support staff was very friendly and kind. I will have to send the phone to Sony. Pretty bad for such an expensive item."
5,One of the best Sony Ericssion phones of 2008,"After I lost my K750i, I HAD to get another one. On googling, I discovered K790a (A stand for Americas i.e. Triband for America 850/1800/1900 MHz). (K790i INTERNATIONAL and K790c CHINA MAINLAND 900/1800/1900 MHz). I had to purchase walkman in-earphones to get the best multimedia experience. Amazing battery life and brilliant photos for this 3.2MP Cybershot. (Note, its little longer than K750i but its fun too). Its well build and even the rumored joystick problem never occured for me. In 2009/2010, you have better options but I still love this phone."
5,Expensive else where...,"Seven months ago there was a bad miss in the engine of my 2001 Pt Cruiser. I looked locally and this little babies were a $100 or better. Just for kicks I tried Amazon and found them for half that, and my Pt is running great now. These injectors are very small and refurbished, but they work great!"
3,Hands free ear buds for cell phone,"Simple to use and worked well with my cell phone. Since it's now illegal to talk on a cell phone without using a hands-free device in California, I'm happy I found this."
1,Very cheap crappy stuff,"I bought these for my girlfriend and within a week of her wearing it twice the ""silver"" started flaking off the earrings. This is probably the worst quality earrings on amazon. You can get much better quality for lesser price. I am quite disappointed."
2,Misleading quality in photo,"Metal part of earrings on back hollow. Overall quality inferior to that which I assumed. Should have assumed poor quality since were only $40. May yet return, purchased as a gift."
5,Everyday classy or evening elegance,"These earrings were my boyfriend's amazingly great first attempt at picking out jewelry on his own; I think he did quite well. The earrings are not too busy or complicated in design, but they still have enough going on to catch the eye. The overall teardrop shape of the earrings are doubled by the teardrop topaz, which gives them a sense of depth and symmetry. The medium size of the earrings themselves makes them appropriate for all occasions and also makes them comfortable to wear. They are just a beautiful and comfortable set of earrings."
5,Cute!,Ordered these for each of my bridesmaids to wear on the big day. I just got them today and they're very cute! Nice quality and something you can dress up or down. I'd definitely recommend them.
5,Great earrings!,"I was skeptical about buying jewelry on the internet but honestly, these earrings are beautiful. I bought them as a gift and the reciever loved them so much. I was very impressed at how nice these earrings actually were. I would definitely order from this company again. I was very satisfied!"
5,superb,these earrings are wonderful. beautifully crafted. i have the ring in sky blue to match. they are dressy but not so much that you can't wear them with jeans and a tee shirt if you like. very comfortable to wear and a perfect size.
1,no change but made eat more,"i had the opposite effect on me with this thing, instead of it helping with my cravings it made it worse to the point where i had to stop taking it bc i was eating everything in site. idk if its just me but i will not be using this again, will have to find something else to help me out.(Update)now that I've stop using it, i had withdrawal from this thing and it made me go crazy, felt like there were ants crawling all under my skin. i couldn't take it and it took weeks for it to stop. now that I'm not itching and shaking anymore I'm gonna try and return it but if i can't I'll just throw them away. not a good experience for me on this thing and will not use it again."
4,Good so far...,"I received this in a timely fashion. When I first started taking it, I noticed I was a little bit jittery and my appetite was NOT suppressed. But now after 4 days of using it (4-5 pills a day), I've noticed a huge difference in my appetite. I'm able to stick to a low-carb diet much easier and I feel like I have more energy. I plan on buying another bottle. I've already lost 3 pounds. 10 more to go! Also, I'm hoping to be able to stop taking it in 30 days (when the habit forms of eating right)."
4,Stunning.,"This book has some really good lessons. Unlike most reviewers, I didn't find the mothers and daughters hard to keep track of. The story may come off as boring and meticulous sensationalism, but most parts of this book are incredibly honest and profound; you just have to pay attention and think about what Tan is trying to say. I seriously believe it's aimed at an immigrant audience; if I dare say, Asian females."
3,I was lucky I found joy.,"It took a while ... but I came to appreciate it.Once again, because I have read some excellent literature that uses change of voice vividly (for example : ""Cloud Atlas"" or ""A Visit From The Goon Squad"" or ""Room""), I found this a bit of a trial at the beginning as it was not well done. At times it was difficult to tell who was the storyteller and the time period of the story ... there are multiple vignettes told in flashback to the daughter's childhood and the mother's childhood ... as well as anecdotes and histories from the other members of the Joy Luck Club. It really took me till the last third to feel involved in the storyline.In the long run, it was a good book. It covers Asian/American + Mother/Daughter relationships well. I am glad I read it ... it was enjoyable ... by the end. But I have others of a similar ilk that I prefer."
5,I read it again and again...,Amy Tan's novels transport you to another place and time. I am reminded of that every time I read one of her beloved books.
3,Hard Read after Decades of the Movie,"This was a book club read last fall.I REALLY looked forward to the book because the movie had been so moving for me over the years beginning at age 15 when I saw it with my grandmother.Having seen the movie really did ruin the experience of the book.So much of the emotion the movie forced upon me simply didn't come across the same way in the book, particularly the interrelationships between the women or the intensity of their personal struggles.That said, I still enjoyed the additional story elements that didn't make it to the movie and it did provide for decent book club conversation.I really wish I hadn't seen the movie so many times.If you HAVEN'T seen the movie, please avoid it until you've read the book."
4,The Joy Luck Club,The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan is a novel that every mother and daughter should read together. It is all about the sacred mother daughter bond and discovering who we are and how much we have of our mother in us. This book perfectly describes the relationship and doesn't try to sugar coat it or add false drama. This is a real book. It was enjoyable to read because there was no point in the story where i felt as if I had to keep reading against my will. This was a thoroughly enjoyable book to read.
4,Flawless story telling depicts intergenerational tension.,"When Rose Hsu Jordan attempts to define the Chinese words hulihudu and heimongmong she says, ""they can't be easily translated because they refer to a sensation that only Chinese people have."" And this sums up Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club - it is an introspective search into what it means to be a Chinese American. Tan adeptly translates these unique Chinese ""sensations"" to the reader through cleverly created characters of gimlet-eyed mothers and their incorrigible daughters. An indirect dialogue between mothers and daughters is set up through Tan's flawless storytelling. It is edifying without being didactic. Readers from all walks of life will walk away feeling wiser."
2,Disappointing and shallow,"My first Amy Tan book and probably my last. Joy Luck Club is mostly fluff. This book offers little to the reader.Writing style is not particularly good.No interesting insights into Chinese Americans.Nothing educational about China, the old country.Not particaularly well researched.There are lots of better books to read if you are interested in any of the above areas. Ha Jin, a Chinese American is an outstanding writer. You will learn a lot about China and be entertained. ""Wild Swans"" is an very educational non-fiction that reads like fiction. I recommend skipping this one and going for the better quality books."
2,Not Buying,I was about to buy this kindle book but the price was 44% higher than the paperback version. I am going to buy it used now so that the publisher doesn't profit from me.
1,I am confused!,"I bought the book after I caught a glimpse of the movie on TV. I read so many good review of the book, so I assumed it's good and bought one myself. I couldnt catch up with the multiple characters. It's just too confusing and I have to keep refering to be beginning to see who's who! I didnt finish the book!"
1,PerpleXed!,"Out of the many books I have read I would consider this the most confusing and mind-bending. I expected the second section of the novel (Scar), to be a continuation of the first part (The Joy Luck Club). Half way through reading it I asked myself ""What in the WORLD is going on??"" The book is somewhat difficult to follow. Sorry Amy, but that's the truth!"
3,good characterization - sad stories,"i tried to read it years ago, but just didn't hold my interest. i tried again, and it was ok...not my style though - the mothers were portrayed as victims - but i thought they chose their own destiny in many ways through the choices they made"
5,Magical storytelling,"The Joy Luck Club has become somewhat of a classic, and with good reason. This tapestry of eight womens' lives works beautifully as a novel. Tan is a gifted storyteller - her concise descriptions weaving a vivid world of Chinese tales meeting modern times. She uses just the right words to animate her characters. Recommended for mothers and daughters alike!"
3,Eh.....,"This is the story of 4 Chinese mothers and their daughters.The mothers all grew up in China, listening to stories of spirits, dragons, etc and being brought up on the principles of Chinese mysticism.The daughters grew up in California, USA, where American practicality and christian ideals were at direct conflict with the way the mothers were raised.The mothers what the best for their daughters. They want their children to grow up with Chinese character under American circumstances (seeing how America is much more liberal than China during this time).The end result is a semi-interesting novel about personal experiences and the life lessons they brought. All in all, I thought it wasn't THAT great. I certainly would not read this story again for many, many years."
2,The problem I had with this novel is that...,"...it makes up stories about Asian culture. For instance, Tan describes how a women's worth is measured by the ""loudness of her husband's belch."" Where in Chinese history or Chinese literature or Chinese culture do you have Chinese men measuring the worth of women by how well they feed them? Speaking of food, Tan describes a story about a duck that wants to be a swan [this is obviously the Ugly Duckling influence (a Western influence)]. Chinese people eat ducks. If you go around San Fran Chinatown and look through some of the restaurants, you'll notice cooked ducks on display for food. Swans signify romantic love because the Chinese admire how they mate for life. Sure, the novel is good (structurally) and it does help feminist causes and such, but why do it in spite of my culture? To me, it's not fair."
3,THe joyluck club shows us we should appreciate our heritage,The joyluck club is about the generations that four Chinese grandmothers would like to share with their daughters. It tells about the hardships each individual goes through in China when migrating to America and the sacrifices that had to encounter so that their daughters wouldn't hae to live as hard a life they did. Although each one of theirs daughters take their new lives for granted without realizing the hardships that the grandparents had to go through. Overall this book made me think of my own mom who migrated from japan. If her life was a shard as these particular charaters. I can see how I take things for advantage in my life to. I didn't like reading it although the book is greatly written it just didn't interet me as other books have.
4,"Great, Easy-Read Novel","I read this for a book report that the teacher assigned about China and its culture and traditions. I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Joy Luck Club, about the realtionships between 4 old-fashioned Chinese mothers and each of their Chinese-American daughters, despite a few snooze sections. The novel is broken up into 16 mini-stories, two for each mother, and two for each daughter. I was really interested in the way that each vignette's plot is intertwined in with the others, although the stories between each generation are somewhat similar. Generally, females might enjoy reading this book more than male readers, but that is just an opinion that my class decided upon. If you enjoy light but interesting reading, then try reading this novel. You might like it!"
4,A must read for all mothers and daughters,"Amy Tan's 'Joy Luck Club' is about 4 Chinese women's life in China, and in the US and their Children. It Talks about each generation's life as a Chinese American, as a mother, daughter, and how they misunderstood each other."
4,Bonds of Mothers and Daughters...Never are they broken,"My daughter had to read this for her summer reading last year and I got the chance to pick it up first :)I enjoyed so much about this story, even though the writing was a bit simplistic, I related not only to the mothers, but to the daughter as well. I felt all the needs of a mother to want only the best for her daughter by trying to teach her lessons that she has already learned, and all the frustrations of the daughters who undoubtedly thought they knew better. The stories of the mother's pasts were heartbreaking, the goals of the daughter's, inspiring, the lessons in Chinese culture more than interesting. This book pulled on my heart strings. If you're a Mom, you will really enjoy this, even with the complicated relationships, if you have a daughter, give it to her to read, she will understand how very special being a daughter is and how very much we want for our daughters.Enjoy! Debbi"
2,You have to be a girl to truly enjoy this book,"I've read better. A story about mothers and their daughters and their relationships with each other most likely only appeals to females. How is a guy supposed to enjoy this book to its fullest? I will say, however, it is well written. Perhaps if Tan authored a more interesting story, it could be enjoyed by a wider range of readers."
4,Joy Luck Club,"Joy Luck Club tells the stories of Chinese-American women who have lived through great tradgedy and lived to tell about it. They have live through war in China, arraigned marriages, abuse, and immigration into America. They made new lives for themselves; found jobs, got married, had a family. Through it all tradition was a foundation for them. They believed in all their Chinese herritage and tried to teach their children about their history and life. This was an eye opening book. It made me look at my life more thankfully."
2,Not so Joyful,"I'm probably the only person in the world that feels this way, but I was not impressed with this book. Despite the stories being interrelated, they felt disjoined and random. There was no central plot that I could find to make the book a success in my mind."
2,Fodder for those who crave sanitized Eastern Mysticism,"How true it is, when Jesus notes that the prophet is often rejected in his own hometown. However, sometimes this happens, not without good reason. As an Asian male raised in the Far East, I can assure you that my traditional Chinese grandparents did not speak in vague metaphors about ""tigers waiting in the trees"", which is, at best, laughable. The Asian male bashing is as unsubtle as one gets as Tan attempts to portray the downtrodden Asian females in a patriachal society (which it admittedly was) without anything positive to say about men in that context. This book does a fair amount of harm by perpetuating stereotypes about Chinese culture. Perhaps the only redeeming factor is the clever use of juxtaposition of the stories of the mothers and daughters to form a comprehensible whole.The Washington Post claims this book is ""Powerful as Myth"". I'd have to agree."
5,Worth reading.,"The Joy Luck Club is a very intresting, rewarding book to read. Although a little bit hard to get into at first."
5,A Story All Mothers and Daughters Should Read!,This book is about Chinese mothers and their American-born daughters with completely different life-styles. Amy Tan does an excellent job portraying the differences the mothers and daughters have and how each one can be resolved. The Joy Luck Club also makes a reader expand their imagination by telling stories from which is told through the characters' point-of-views and experinces. A fabulous story in which morals are learned and knowledge is gained. Every mother and daughter should read this book and learn the closeness of their relationship!
4,"not good, not bad, just different","I think the book is very interesting to read and I liked the way Tan portrays her characters. Even though you may find some of them pretty self-centered and lacking any sense of responsibility, you get a very good image of every one of them, and might even feel with some. I also believe it helps to understand people from a different cultural background."
1,No Joyluck for the Chinaman,"The novel exhibits a one dimensional, Westernized perspective of the often complex Chinese social interactions in particular and East Asian in general. It overtly awashes in sentimenal values in place of balanced objectivity, insults the integrity of a proud tradition, and reinforced pervasive stereotypes of Asian men by dehumanizing them as abusively rigid, asexual misogynist. Conversely, the work generally depicts Chinese women as scheming, sexually submissive victims---a kind of yellow noble savage (ie, Madame Butterfly, Miss Saigon). Western audiences and Asian self-haters may praise it for the novel's allege cultural richness because it reinforces their long held prejudices of those ""fresh off the boats."" However, most Asian male reviewers of this melodrama finds it repugnant and deeply offensive. A work of literary luminary? Think not!"
5,One of my favorite books,This is the first book I ever remember having an emotional connection with. I cried as these women endured loss after loss. I haven't read it in several years but will do so again soon.
2,Very Slow Read,"The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan was a very slow read and I had a very difficult time getting into the story. What was interesting to me was that the women were so rude to one another although there were glimpses of kindness. These women lived in difficult times, indured injustice and yet they didn't support one another with graciousness. Amy Tan reveals the Chinese culture and the difficult transition from China to America. This story begs the question ""How well do you really know your mother?"""
3,A good rainy day read,"I wish.. I could say,I stayed up until all hours anticipating the finish of this book.But, I found myself putting it down for the most simple reasons. IF you have nothing better to do, nothing better to read on the plane or by the pool.. this would be a nice way to pass the time."
4,Powerful and Entertaining,"Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club is one of the most relatable novels I have read. It follows the relationships of Chinese women and their grown daughters as they struggle to find their places in the world. Each of these women tell stories from their past. We see what each of the mothers went through in China and why they came to America and we see what the daughters have gone through in their lives as well. These stories draw the reader into very relatable stories highlighting love, relationships, purpose, and understanding, just to name a few. Many of the stories involve misunderstanding, especially concerning the mother-daughter relationship. This novel is powerful, entertaining and touching all at the same time. I highly recommend it."
1,The Worst Luck Club,"The Joy Luck Club is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. The plot, focusing on four Asian women and their children, is an utmost disappointment. The book has no particular plot-line, and each of the small stories is as bad as the one before it. Don't waste your money on this book!"
4,it was alright,the book was alright it had a good concept to it it shows americans didnt only have problems so did chinese people i thought it was a great book and people who enjoy reading books thats take you back in time will enjoy this book.
1,The Joy Luck Club,"Product never arrived, therefore I am extremely unhappy since this book was for a class."
1,an interestingly written book,"I liked reading The Joy Luck Club mainly for the style in which it was written, giving each mother and daughter her own voice to express in her own terms what happened and what she thinks is going on. The story i liked most was The Red Candle. The main character's ability to get herself out of an incredibly difficult situation without losing face or creating a bad situation for her family or her in-laws was remarkable. She did it by using her brain and the information available to her; she made me smile."
1,It was the most unbearable reading experience,I read this book this year...(9th grade year) we have to do a report on it and it was horrible because there is no information on it.i recommend this to no one because it is pathetic..Amy Tan should learn how to write a book that is not so confusing.
4,The Joyluck Club,"The Joyluck Club is a sad and an entertaining book. It's a book about four mothers who taught their daughter what their Chinese culture's like. The mothers move from one place to another and learn their new life there. They try to teach their daughters, their chinese life even though they know english pretty well and were born in United States. They still have a part of chinese in them.I would recommend this book to anyone! this book is a great book."
4,Joy Luck Club,"I thought this book was very well written. It was slightly hard to follow in some situations, because it jumps around a lot, but it's worth trying out. I'd advise it to anyone interested in cultures and historical views."
4,Journal #6,The Joy Luck Club was an inspirational book. It allowed me to deal with my own family issues. The relationship between the mtohers and daughters was so heart warming in the end of the novel. Amy Tan did a wonderful job in portraying the family values and ties between the two generations. I thouroughly enjoyed the storyline especially becase the structure in which it was writen was very organized. I gave it 4 1/2 stars.
5,Reality,"This book was very well written with truth of the Chinese culture during the earlier years. To show the pain and suffering of the women was extreme. The fair and unfair reality between families and yet in the end, they all still hold a strong bond."
1,A misleading book,"I'm a graduate student from mainland China, living in New Jersey right now. I saw the movie on TV two years ago then I borrowed the book from my friends. Frankly, I think this book is pretty boring. As many American people like Chinese food here, but that's quite different from genuine Chinese style. Joy Luck Club is just like the modified Chinese food, many people love it, but you think that is really what's happening in China and you can learn something about Chinese culture from this book, you are absolutely mislead by it. Wild Swans - Three Daughters of China is a much better book, I sincerely recommended it, believe me."
4,The Joy Luck Club is a great book!!,"The Joy Luck club by Amy Tan is truly a remarkable book. It is a novel that deals with the relationships between mothers and daghters. It also deals with the conflicts between Chinese and American cultures. A delight to read, this novel involves the reader as it progresses through the stories of these four mothers and four daughters. These characters deal with issues such as rape, divorice, failure, abandonment, and many more. Throughout this novel, by dealing with these issues, the daughters learn to understand their mothers' views on life.Our group of five all read and enjoyed this book. We highly recommend it to any reader interested in Chinese Culture and/or the relationship between mothers and daughters."
5,Even Better the second time around,"I just finihsed this book for the second time, after reading it years ago. I have to say, it's one of the best books I've read in years. The writing is brilliant--simple and plain and the stories ran through my head, placing me in San Francisco and in China and introducing me to a world I previous knew nothing about. It has given me a much greater respect and understanding for Chinese people.I recommend this book with five stars."
4,The Joy Luck Club,"Each of the four Chinese ladies at the Mahjong table has a story to tell. The Joy Luck Club tells the story in detail. Each arrived in America through different circumstances. Many faced poverty, arranged marriages and loss of children, family and possessions. They lived through hardships that they cannot forget. When they arrived in America, they learned to speak English and adapt to American ways although Chinese culture still dominated their lives. The Joy Luck Club is also about their daughters. The daughters are American-born Chinese and are totally different. They cannot understand their mothers and become frustrated easily by their ways.The story is rich with detail and engages the reader in small captivating chapters. It is easy to cry as you imagine some of the pain that the mothers experienced in China. One can tell the huge generation gap among immigrant mothers and their American-born daughters more clearly after reading this book."
4,The Joy Luck Club,"The Joy Luck Club looks at the complex relationships between mothers and daughters. Amy Tan tells the stories of four Chinese women tring to raise American daughters. Each mother wants her daughter to have all of the values of Chinese women with the freedoms of American women. The individual stroies of each woman is not only interesting, but gives insite as to how she raises her daughter. I highly recomend this book because of heart wrenching stories that each mother tells about her childhood. I also enjoy the way her adult daughter relates the srory to her own relationship with her mother."
5,Great storytelling,"It's a little hard to get used to at first, but buy part two, I was able to fully understand the flow of the writing. Loved the look into Asian culture."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"the one brief section that felt forced (dwelling on the significance of the ink used to sign a check) helped emphasize what is so effectively authentic about the writing of this novel generally. the origins and implications of an event are both presented as having equal substance, it never seems like something is just a bridge to get to a meaningful predecided outcome. aside from an occasional flaunted apathy to animal rights it's a good book."
5,FIVE STARS,"THose that say that this book is confusing, it is. But Amy Tan makes this novel confusing to illustrate the main theme in this book: Americans don't understand Asian Americans and the chinese culture. I've read this book several times in and out of the classroom and enjoyed it throughly. It tells of morals that can apply to anyone, such as the strained relationship between mother and daughter. I highly recommend this amazing novel to anyone."
4,A wonderful book for immmigrant mothers and daughters,"I just finished reading The Joy Luck Club and I would highly recommend this book to all mothers and daughters. I am a first generation immigrant from India and there are many similarities in Indian and Chinese cultures. This book travels between America and China and explores intimately mothers and daughters of these two lands. It makes you smile, laugh and also cry. Amy Tan's intimate language flows easily and keeps you interested throughout. I have a daughter and this book intimately touched me in many ways as it explores the first generation immigrant mothers and their daughters. When I finished this book, I was ready to visit my local library and pick up her book ""The Bonsetter's Daughter"". Thank you Amy Tan for many hours of pleasure reading your book."
1,Not worth reading,"I didnt like the book when I read it, I found it to be confusing more then it was interesting. But if you have to do a report on the book .. I would suggest watching the movie before reading the book."
1,terrible,I had to read this book for school over the summer. It had to be the worst book ive ever read. I would have to b e out of my mind to recommend this to anyone. It was very hard to understand there was no main character. It constantly switched characters. The book was just plain stupid! I wish i could give it no stars.
3,Generation Connection,"No matter how different it could be bringing up a child, the difficulty in doing that in foreign countries, with different traditions, the blood between family members is stronger than it all, and will always come on top no matter what.Amy Tan uses the chinese culture to perfection in demonstrating the diversity between mothers and daughters. The difference in generations, and the stubbornness and beliefs of each one.A recommended book to read, it is easier to understand it if you are familiar with the chinese culture, but gives an excellent example to what mistakes we could fall into, and how it is so essential to learn from our experiences.The story could get slow for a while but if you are used to Amy Tan's style you would know that it will get better."
4,An amazing novel that penetrates the truth of four women.,"""The Joy Luck Club"" is an amazing novel that penetrates the truth of four Chinese women and their Americanized daughter. The mother-daughter relationship bonding with memories they inherit from the past. It shows us the cultural difference of the Chinese in America. It was easy for me to adapt to the story because I am a young Asian American growing up with the Chinese culture that I've inherited from my family. I truly understand the dialogue it uses. Along with Amy Tan's other books-""The Kitchen God's Wife"" and ""The Hundred Secret Sense"", it also concentrates on the Chinese culture in America."
2,4 Traditional Women Facing Hardships w Americanized Daughter,"First of all I gave this book a 2 star because the book talks too much about women and the point of view or the person telling the story shifts back and forth so it makes the book very confusing to follow. The story is about 4 women from China during the time when China was invaded by the Japanese. The four women and thier families had to go through lots of suffereings and they finally decided to go to America. In America the 4 women each has a daughter and they all become americanized. The four women wanted to keep the Chinese tradition so they made up the Joy Luck Club to have little get togethers where they would enjoy eaches company. The story sounded really interesting; however, it is really boring because it deals too much with women issues."
2,Started Off Pretty Good For a Chinese- American Fiction,"I thought the story was interesting, but the way it was boring was hard to read, it was boring, plain and simple. The portrait painted by this author of Chinese-Americans is all just fluff. Please, get real."
4,Very hard to put down.,"A lovely book with a variety of characters, delving into the problems and achievements of an exchange of language and culture. It shows just how strong the women is this country are whilst being practically ignored."
1,stereotypes galore,"I thought this book will be very intruging. WELL IS STINKS.1st, there were no main characters, which adds on to confusing.2nd, it is so stereotyped! Here is just a bad example of a another stereotypical view of the Chinese. Buy this only to destroy it."
3,Book was okay. Good Condition,"The book was in good condition, but I wish I would've known that there was huge blue writing all on the inside cover. If I would've known, I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Confusing But A Great Story,"Okay, first off, I love Amy Tan. Anyone who can create Sagwa is okay with me. ^-^But, I had to read this book for a project in school. It was one of the hardest reads for me. It was so hard to follow initially because it's told in first person...by like...what, 6 different characters? I got the gyst of it, and it WAS an interesting story, but you really have to buckle down to follow it, in my opinion.Personally, I had to watch the movie to pick up things I missed in the book. It was easier to keep track of the characters that way. But, like I said, that's just me. The book WAS an interesting one and a very good story...just a little hard to follow."
2,Ordinary,Tan's attempts to portray the relationships between these mothers and daughters. ....is nothing short of dismal.
2,The Joy Luck Club,Thic copy appeared older than expected and the cover was not the same as advertised.
5,A wonderful read!,"Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club is a marvelous novel. The writing style is deceptively simple, the characters are human and likable, and the plot swift and compelling. I heartily recommend this book to anyone. This is a best seller for a very good reason."
1,it sucked,"this book is only interesting to boring computer geeks who have nothing better to do but read stupid books that the author doesn't even know if everything she said in the book is true. I don't know how anyone could find this pathetic excuse for a good read for english class (boring) even a bit interesting. Please, NO ONE READ THIS DUMB BOOK."
5,One of the many great books you read once in awhile!,"I was so touched by all the stories.....looking at both sides of a story really benefited myself in understanding my mother more....this book is remarkable! I read it mainly b/c of my humanities class, but now----I want to re-read it over again just for the pleasure of it. Outstanding book! Every mother had their brains, had their wits, had their stiff side; but their only desire in life is to give face to their daughters."
1,Unfortunately I too think this book is boring,"I disagree with people who say reviews are unfair here. I find this book boring, but it does appeal to some other people. One side should not try to say the other side is unfair. The story is like a soap opera, to me. The writing style is just too bland for my taste, no where as poetic as Woman Warrior."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK,"This book is soooooo sterotyped!!!!!! Normal Chinese are nowhere as weird and brain-dead as that. Ask any Chinese, they'll totally understand what I mean. By the way, isn't it sick how all Chinese women are portrayed as China Dolls?"
4,Happiness,I think that this book was wonderful. It gave me an idea of the different lifestyles that are lived and the things that every ethnic race has to endure. I believe that every student should be given the opportunity to broaden their horizons by learning about other cultures. I also believe that Amy Tan did a wonderful job portraying the lives of women and their children. Only because it gave a description of four different lives and their problems and solutions to the world around them.
4,"""The Joy Luck Club""","This book is a good one. It not only immerses you in Chinease culture, but it makes you ponder questions about family. Tan does a great job going into great detail about the relationships between the mothers and daughters. At first I thought I would hate this book, but the engrossing stories and the sentimentallity and love between the characters of this book made it an enjoyable reading experience. It will make you want to read another book from Amy Tan. I strongly recommend it, even if you are not normally into emotional books about family."
2,Odd book,"At times this book is pretty good, but at times it is border line trash. Every single female character in the book was ... . I had no idea nineteenth century women were so ""easy."" The female characters in this book were lured into the sack by many different techniques. Common to all was that they never once said no, despite the fact that adultry was often involved. You really have to wonder if the author has issues with women."
1,Civil War softcore porn,"I made a mistake with this book. I should have read the first page before buying. I don't mind if a novelist wants to reduce a Confederate general's deified historical status a peg or two, but come on, Keneally describes Stonewall Jackson masterbating on the very first page of chapter one! And that's the problem with this book; every character in it is a degenerate with nothing but sex on his or her mind, as if there was no war going on all around them. Eventually, I got tired of reading this garbage and at the half way point just chucked it into the...can. However, if you want to read a good novel of the Civil War where the Civil War is indeed the primary focus, look elsewhere."
4,My son loves this police van!,"I am adding this item to my son's Christmas wishlist because it is such a fun toy. He plays with it every time we visit our favorite toy store. I disagree with the previous reviewer. The quality of all Playmobile toys is extremely high. However, they are a construction toy of sorts in that the kids put them together and can easily take them apart. The only reason I don't rate it a 5 is because the policemen are a little big for the size of the doors. It is hard for my 3.5 year old to get them in. I do not think that would be as much of a problem for an older child."
1,Over priced,Received this item yesterday. Was very disappointed with the size of the police car considering the price was $40. Car at most is 8 inches long and quality not up to the price. (...)
5,I'm a fan.,"Two of my fave sci-fi movies in one set,I couldn't turn it down.'Nuff said,I gotta get back to watching the movie!"
3,"An OK listen, but could be much better","This audio tape was classic Sylvia Browne, warm and witty and easy to understand. It is basically a tape of one of her lectures, and feel the time I had to listen to other people's questions was not worth the half hour of my time. I would have preferred another meditation or more time of another lecture instead of hearing ""Is my love life going to improve?"" one more time. Also is starting to show how comercial she is getting - keeps referring to the fact that she has pay-per-views etc."
4,A comfort for those whom death has touched,One of Sylvia's warmest works. Side A of tape 2 is the best.I wasn't interested too much in the Q&A; after listening to it the first time but all-in-all a very informative audio book.
1,THIS IS THE OLD EDITION,YOU PROBLY WANT THE NEW 1999 EDITION WITH THE CD-ROM. DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!
3,It was just OK.,"The sender sent this book off pretty quick, but the book could of been wrapped better! The book came in a manilla envelope, considering it was a thick paperback, I thought it should of been wrapped in an envelope, then put into one. So, the book came with a lots of dents and the binder was a little beat up."
1,At least i got my money back?,"paid for this book and never received it. At least i got my money back, too bad the price i paid for the class to lower my GPA isn't covered i guess. I suggest buying the book in person?"
4,The Media of Mass Communication,The book was received just as it was described. Seller was easy to work with. Much cheaper than if I would have bought it from the bookstore on campus.
1,Earlier editions were better,I started using an earlier version of this book three years ago for my college massmedia class. I decided it was time to update-a media text should be current. A big mistake. My students liked the 8th edition and so did I. The 9th edition is disjointed and needs a great deal of supplemental material. This has been a long academic year. I will pick another book for next semester.
4,History of Journalism,Vivian did a fine job introducing readers to the history of journalism and relating it to where journalism and mass media has come since those first days of covering the Civil War. Readers should be open minded and consider the ethics and history as they absorb the material for the full benefit of Vivian's work.
2,Unbalanced and unreadable,"This book is utterly basic and not fit for even a community college class, more like a junior high or maybe a high school class. Presumably, it's written for people who don't know what the author is talking about and are completely stupid. The author never fails to bring his own viewpoints into supposedly writing an objective, educational book. My professor confessed that they wouldn't have used this book to teach the class, but that they were taking over the class for the first time from another professor who had used it.I was taking a mass communication class that used this book, but dropped the class in favor of spending more time working on the school paper. I missed absolutely nothing, and in fact, learned more about mass communication this way."
3,False advertising,I received this item today and it showed up with only three animals. It clearly states in the item description that it comes with three cars and FIVE animals. This is not what I received. I'm quite disappointed. Will investigate the situation with Amazon tomorrow.
2,"Fun, but can't use the pieces","This is a fun set, except the animals do not fit through any of the tunnuls. We use the open box-cars for the barels that go with another set. If you are only going to use the animals without any tunnels, which is difficult with small children (they love tunnels), its a fun set. If you set up big train configs...get something else."
1,only came with 3 animals,I am so annoyed that this only came with 3 animals. In the description it claims to come with 5 and in reality mine only came with 3.
3,disappointed,Although I like the the circus set overall I was disappointed that the set only included 3 of the animals not the 4 it appears to advertise...This is the first time I have been extremely disappointed in the Thomas Line I have purchased in the past..I would have liked it if Amazon was more specific in their product description..If it was 3 animals it should have said so...Next time I will pay closer attention to the reviews from other customer's.
3,Nice addition to Thomas Set for toddler,"I wanted to add something simple to my toddler's train set, so this seems like a nice addition. However, the product description is wrong. The set we received on came with 3 animals - no zebra included. Not bad enough of a problem to return it for us. Older children (like my 6 year old) might notice the discrepancy though."
2,Frustrating,"The circus train is a source of frustration for my son. When the animals are inside the cars they are too tall to fit through any of the tunnels, so he has to take the animals out of the train to pass through the tunnels. Additionally, the high profile of the cars makes them frequently tip over when rounding turns on the track.As with all of the other Thomas Wooden Railway products we have purchased, the materials are high quality, but I would recommend steering clear of this particular train!"
4,Thomas and Friends,Grandson Loves Thomas and Friends was very excited that he got it goes very well with all his other Thomas and Friends trains.
4,Great toy except at the tunnels,"My dd loves her trains and these cars are a lot of fun for her. She really doesn't use them with the wooden animals too much though since they are too tall to make it through the tunnel or covered bridge on her set. Obviously this is a problem, but I still recommend them because they are the only cars that she can load up with stuff. She puts little plastic animals in the back (you know the kind that come in a bag for about a dollar.) Also Sir Topham hat can sit in the car too until you get to a tunnel that is. i do wish I had realized the animals were too tall before I bought them."
2,Not worth the money,"This set is really cute, and my son likes playing with and naming the animals but it's not worth the money. The animals don't stay up very well in the cars and if you have any tunnels on you track they don't fit through them.Also, the trains are plastic and too light.Do yourself and your child a favor, spend your money on a different train or add to your track instead of buying this circus train set."
2,Too tall for tunnels,"My son is a major Thomas fan. This train set is fun except if you have tunnels on your track. If you do, beware...you have to remove the animals from the cars because the animals are too tall to get through the tunnels. Needless to say, this can be very frustrating for a 2 year old."
2,Won't fit through tunnels,"My twins loved the circus trains they got for their birthday - until they discovered that the trains won't go through tunnels or covered bridges with the animals in them! If your child has a simple circle set, or a flat track layout without tunnels or bridges, he/she will love the circus train. Otherwise, he/she will be frustrated (as my kids are) each time the train approaches a tunnel or bridge, when he/she has to remove the animals to get the train through. (If the Learning Curve folks are reading this, how about designing a circus train that will fit through the tunnels? I'd definitely buy one!)"
2,New book....outdated information,"Pediatric Dentists are battling for early visits to prevent and detect problems with early childhood caries. The rugrats have not yet received this message. The book suggests that the time for the first visit is once all primary teeth are erupted. That would mean ca. 3 years of age which seems to match with Angelica and Susie's age. The ""little kids"" have some erupted teeth (Chuckie and the twins), but they are told that they are too young to see the dentist - The chance to include anticipatory guidance and discuss baby bottle caries is clearly missed. Why does a dentist have to be bald and look this serious? At least x-rays are taken and some prevention is discussed."
4,A small gem of fantasy,"While this book is not ambitious or unique, it is a tight, engaging fantasy story. I'm surprised it has never been reprinted and that there are no other reviews here.Star Axe is a coming-of-age, sword-in-the-stone, epic-fight-vs-good-and-evil sort of fantasy. It is a similar style of writing to what you would find in Sterling Lanier's books, such as Hiero's Journey and Menace Under Marswood. It is a fun and easy read, but memorable. Not a fantasy great, but well worth picking up."
2,Super Reader,"Pretty ordinary sword and sorcery style novel, with, you guessed it, a Star Axe.Not much of a story or character to be found here."
1,Conquest of the Weast India,"The facsimile image is nearly unreadable. Too bad, I would have liked to read this account, The original was written in an older script and the facsimile was blurry so between the two the images were unuseable."
5,"Fun, fun, fun!","We have two plasma cars, and we will be buying two more. I thought my four children could share, but no one wants to get off! I've taken a spin on the car, and they are fun to drive. You do have to tighten the steering wheel down tight to get the car to function properly. I can even zoom around with my two year old sitting with me. He also likes to just push it around with his feet. Fun for the whole family!"
5,Love the Plasma Car,"Purchased this for my 3 year old for Christmas and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! It was easy to assemble. She hopped right on and was off. Super easy to maneuver and propel. She loves it. Now if we could just keep her five older siblings off of it."
4,Needs more traction,Thought I would be able to have my kids ride this on the kitchen floor but there's not enough traction on the wheels. Good toy but if you definitely need a place outside or one of those flat carpets like they have in offices etc... I wouldn't get it.
1,"BUYER BEWARE!!! This is a ""Swivel Car"" NOT a Plasmacar","I just recieved this today and as other reviewers said it is not the name brand ""Plasmacar"" by PlaSmart. Even though it fulfilled by Amazon and even though the PlasmaCar logo and pics and videos from their website are shown on product description. I returned it and located one a half hour away for my daughter's Christmas present. It remains to be seen whether i will get what i paid for my rush shipping back."
5,Love Love Love!!!,"Best little car ever! My 2 1/2 year old loves zooming around on this car. Mommy and Daddy also took it for a spin throughout the house :) This is an awesome gift, wish I had one too."
5,Plasma car is a great toy!,"I bought this for my daughter who is 4, and she loves it. It was easy to put together, and seems to be very good quality. She loves it because it was so easy to ride. I wish I had bought two (so my son could have one too). They fight over it!"
5,Every Kid Needs One!,"This is great! Your kid gets on it , and it goes, boy is it great fun...every kid needs one!"
3,A fun toy but,I bought this for my grand daughter for her sixth birthday. She played with it briefly but prefers her scooter. The toy is best suited for a younger child I believe. The other problem is that she lives in a small house without much room to maneuver. It doesn't go that well on rugs.
5,excellent gift,"I bought this as a Christmas gift. The girls love playing with these downstairs. My 7 year old really does it and my 4 yr. old just pushing with her feet all over the place. It was the hit on Christmas morning. Definitely worth it, if you are looking at them."
3,"Teasing, but falls short of expectations","For me, this toy is teasing, but falls short of expectations. Why? Because it sells for a premium, and is built at a discount. It is not durable even for a 3-Yr girl. The steering keeps alignment to front wheels for minutes; tightening as instructed does not suffice. Needed a lock washer and alignment pin. Should either be priced-up and worth it, or priced at $35 if supplied as-is. Best recommendation is don't purchase online. Instead, do at a local store where they can support the product as-needed. Sorry Amazon. Ari"
3,NOT pink its red,"The product is a fun product daughter likes it but the title clearly says plasmacar ""pink"" the product is red NOT pink"
5,Granddaughter loved it!,"I bought two of these for Christmas this year, one for my 7 year old granddaughter and another one for the 15 month old figuring she would grow into it and that way there would be no fights. The baby is too small yet but the 7 year old just loves it. She can't wait to use it outside this summer and is going to ""lend"" the baby's to her friend to use. Meanwhile, there go the hardwood floors, seriously, has not really damaged. Would definitely recommend!"
3,Not really the best,"Not even close to the best. It's good, especially if you already know and love NRBQ. If this rockin' good time band is new to you, I recommend you get the Yankee Stadium LP (it's not live, but has that live feel). This will give you a good taste of the band."
1,A waste of time,"This book is rubbish. The quote, ""God created us to be worshipers, but that relationship was broken by the fall and we must seek to restore it through a lifestyle of worship."" p176, sums it all up. Our relationship with God is only restored through the death of Jesus on the cross.If you're looking for a book on worship try,""Worship by the book"", edited by D.A.Carson, or ""Engaging with God"" by David Peterson. They are a bit heavier, but much more theological and useful."
5,Jacona is one of those books you can't put down.,"Jacona is the story of the Mestas family's experiences and love for New Mexico, especially Jacona, in the early years of Spanish exploration and colonization of the new world. Jacona has everything: adventure, hardship, battles, romance, family, politics and religion - a well rounded view of Spanish life and customs in the harsh but beautiful terrain of New Mexico. Growing up in Jacona myself, I was deeply touched by the story which brought to life a bit of my history and reinforced my opinion that Jacona is and always has been one of the most beautiful and enchanting places on earth."
5,Fascinating and interesting history,"This novel is very well researched. It covers the early Spanish settlements in Mexico and New Mexicao from 1540-1680, and is the story of a fictional family based on the author's own ancestors. The writing is formal and somewhat stiff, but many times you can't put it down. And I learned a lot."
1,Not a new album. FRAUD,"This is not a new album , but simply 2 earlier ones re-hashed and retitled. This is fraudulent in my opinionDo Not Buy"
4,Good Value for Quality fixture,The light showed up and was much heavier than expected. Very good quality for the price. The color was a little off for weathered copper. It is a solid rich brown. The installation was typical and nothing extra required. It was delivered sooner than expected.
4,Nice Fixture,The fixture installed easily and looks great. The unit was received within two days of placing the order. The only complaint I would have would be two of the sockets were offset making installing the bulbs a little more difficult than the others.
3,Not greatest for fun,"I bought this program for my little cousin in hopes that his math skills would improve for college. The program is put together pretty well, however, it is not much for making the subject fun. I purchased this program in hopes that he would be able to interact and enjoy math a little more but unfortunately it failed him in that area. I felt as if he might as well have just read a textbook instead. The good thing about this software is that it does a good job helping you plan goals. Also the tests that are provided give you good practice, but overall, it can be pretty boring. It really does give good explainations on how to do a certain math function; I just wish it was a little more fun."
2,Marginal Tutorial Program,"Good coverage of the subject areas if you have the time and patience to plod through each subject area and sub-area. Diagnostic tools are extremely weak. The program prompts the user to take the tests in the subject area, but only provides the number correct and a percentage score as feedback. There is no way to determine which questions the user got wrong, consequently providing no way to focus the user's study efforts (i.e. the user may not need to study an entire subject area, but one sub-area). The sub-areas also have a diagnostic test that does provide the user with immediate right/wrong feedback (also allowing multiple guesses), but does not offer a correct solution to the math problem if the user selected a wrong answer first. Last, there are many math and logical errors in the sub-area diagnostic test questions that only frustrate the user."
3,Excel Mathematics,"This product is good, but you have to do alot of reading like over 20 pagses per little lesson. It dosen't really have a great deal of video interaction. it is good but it is going to take about 2 months to get through it and it bores you after a well. and you have to take breaks or you won't be able to go on."
2,Consider it...,"I bought this software back in 2001 and at that time found it to be a bit too dry. Still, I was desperate for anything to inspire my kids to do math via PC.Jump to 2005, I am taking a college Calculus course at night and lost in a jungle of understandable theory dependant on long forgotten basics: basic algebra, basic trigonometry etc.I found a fairly helpful text book and guess what?Yes, I loaded this program and ran the 1st CD.It became my late night back-up buddy...It covers practically everything I need and the price is OK.Outdated but just in time..."
1,Excel @ Mathematics,"The software is defective. The claimed manufacturer and tech support provider no longer accepts claim for this software. In order to use the software and download it I am instructed to list my name with Knowledgeadventure.com per use of modem which goes to the company ""Knowledge Adventure."" However, as Knowledge Adventure Inc., is no longer is affiliated with this software and has no idea who is (but will give plenty of run around) I can't sign in and download the software. Therefore the software is useless. I suggest the ceasing and desisting of selling this product. To claim this product currently has any affiliation with Knowledge Adventure as you are led to believe by the packaging and manual is a total lie!!!"
1,This Controller Is Not Wireless,"This controller is cool looking, but in the photo, it does not show the cord that is permanently attached to the top of it. That convenient photoshop trimming is pretty misleading, if you ask me..."
4,this is the same as the spiderman controller just green,this controller seems to work ok is nicer size than the mini pads. it lights green and has the hulk on it otherwise just like the spiderman controll. if you have this one ya might want to get the spiderman one to make a set. i have a previouse one of wolveriene with turbo but not lighted wish the lighted ones had turbo and that they re release the wolveriene one so it lights .
3,my reveiw,I thought the reveiws were very interesting becausei found out what and why they bought the items andand also i do not want the hulk controller for the ps2 yet buti will think about it. Anyway thanks for reading this reveiw.
4,red cross emergency radio,"every home should have a radio with fresh batteries and a back up ""crank generator"". this is a good product at a reasonable price."
2,No TV-VHF,The radio in my cart that i ordered showed TV-VHF channels 2-13. The radio i received had no TV-VHF. The FR300 with or without TV-VHF have the same product number.
3,Adapter,I would like to know why a adapter doesn't come with the radio since they are so costly.I think it would be more useable for most people.Dolly Allender recent purchased
1,Don't waste your money on this piece of junk,Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. I bought one and found it to be the worst investment I have ever made. The radio's light wouldn't work. The rechargeable battery in the unit only works for a very short time after cranking. When I took a closer look at the material I found that it was made of a cheap plastic and the seams showed cheap manufacture. This radio's reception is not even as good as that of radios I've found that only cost five dollars. This radio looks like one of those that magazine companies give away with their subscription. This is a perfect example of cheap parts=maximum profits for the manufacturer of this product.
2,"Nice features, but crank does not work as advertised","I got good enough reception on almost everything, but the rechargeable battery in the unit only works for a short time after cranking. The cranking power does not last nearly as long as advertised. The LED lights in worked fine in mine also."
1,Possibly the worst product I have ever bought,I agree with the other feedback. I don't know what the other reviewer was on but this product has got to be the worst product I have ever bought. When the earthquake occurred this product ran off on me.Cons:1. Terrible radio reception.2. Takes a long time to crank for any good use. I ended up putting regular batteries in it.3. Cheap material means low durability (mine wouldn't play the radio because the switch wore out.4. The light was weak.5. Couldn't even get tv reception.Pros:1. NoneConclusion:Don't buy this radio. I returned mine and chalked it up to lesson learned. Next time I will take a closer look and test the product before buying when it comes to electronics.
5,Excellent Hand Crank Radio,"My wife and I used the FR300 during the week-long Queens blackout this past summer and this little radio delivered. One 2 minute winding lasted for an hour on medium volume. The cell phone charger is cool, but it takes a lot of winding. The light is good in a pinch, but not particularly useful."
4,WHAT FUN!! I LOVE IT!,"I had a crank radio since 1999, and it finally gave out this year. I was excited to find this one at a decent price, and with the added bonus of a cell phone emergency charger! The adapters fit most phones, and it's just good to know that wherever you are, you can make a phone call even with a dead phone battery. I read some reviews about a difficulty getting the battery case open, but I had absolutely no problem with it. Yes, it would be great if it came with an AC adapter (and I wouldn't have it without); I just rigged up my own with a Wal Mart universal power supply for $15.00. It takes 4.5 -5 volts. It runs for HOURS after charging it with an adapter. Reception has been good, not only in northern Wisconsin, but in Illinois as well. NPR is great! and who really needs the TV stations! (though I do get one once in a while).Anyway, I recommend it!"
3,FR300 Emergency Radio,"I bought this radio primarily for use on the job site. I figured with the external antenna that it'd be able to pull in my favorite local station. It has a weak signal, but I was hoping... Well, it won't do the trick in most locations so far, but overall I'm happy with the radioI also liked the idea of having an alternative source of power for emergencies, and the hand crank works just as advertised. Overall a good buy."
4,"Handy for emergency, camping","Having an emergency radio on hand is prudent. Useful for primitive camping too. Sound quality is OK for a single-speaker $50 unit and perfectly adequate for what the radio is designed for - news, sports, weather, emergency info. You can certainly listen to songs, but don't expect great sound quality. Hand cranking gives quick power that lasts reasonably well. The lights/siren and would be useful for lighting or to attract attention in an emergency. Picks up a weather band at our home when my older weather band radio does not. My user guide doesn't mention TV reception and I haven't been able to find closest station - perhaps this feature ended with digital? Not a big deal for me but could be a deal breaker for others. Given the price it is fairly study and has a protective case. Fairly small and lightweight so could be carried in a daypack."
3,A bit disappointed,"We like the radio, however, you can't read on the back what to plug into what jack! That was very disappointing. Other than that, it seems to be a fine little radio for the price."
4,OK,It was kind of cute. I found the Clifford's Noisy Day to be a bit more educational but this is a nice book.
4,An Energetic & Exciting Soundtrack For Acceleracers Fans!,"The Hot Wheels AcceleRacers CD features an eclectic mix of hard rock, punk and rap tracks from the Hot Wheels AcceleRacers TV movies and DVDs, such as Go, Tearin' Up The Streets and the AcceleRacers Theme Song. The songs are all high energy and my kids enjoy dancing and singing to them.Extras with this CD include three Hot Wheels AcceleRacers trading cards, an exclusive code to download a hidden song, and a bonus poster.The track listing is:1. AcceleRacers Theme2. Drive3. Action4. Anything But Down5. Go6. Accelerate7. Drag Racer8. Get To The Finish Line9. Tearin Up The Streets10. Pedal to the Metal -- Kazzer11. Hot Rod -- Christopher Lawrence12. Circles -- Nonpoint13. Open Road Song -- Eve 6"
5,Awesome CD!,"I bought this CD a few days after it first came out and I've been listening to it ever since. The songs are really good! I agree that the lyrics are a bit more for older kids (like me and my 13 year old sis), but both my 5 year old brother and my 3 year old sister love dancing to these songs. They all have perfect dance beats. And if you've seen the movies, you'll recognize songs like ""Go"" and ""Action"". All in all, this is a great CD and worth buying if you're a fan of the Acceleracers series.*Hannah"
4,Good Clean Fun,"My son loves the music and I think the songs are well-written. It's entertaining, energetic, and the songs tell stories without unnecessary innuendo. This collection is refreshing. It Rocks (and Raps) in a positive key."
4,Great for every Acceleracers fan,This cd has all the tunes from all the Acceleracer movies. My boys loved this CD. The listen to it while traveling in the car or while playing with their cars. They can tell me what movie each song is from and what is happening at the time the song plays in the movie...
3,"Little boys like rock music, but lyrics over their head","My 6 year old son had been listening to the sound bites on line, so we decided to get him the CD for his birthday. My husband and I both agree the music is very good, but the lyric content is not very accesable for younger kids. They like listening to it, dancing to it, but when asked what the song was about they have no clue. We decided to get the CD as a compromise. We reviewed the first of the new movies and thought they were too mature for our kids. We wish Hotwheels would remember their youngest fans and consider where they are developmentally and provide products accordingly."
3,Missing our favorite song,"Our son LOVES Hot Wheels. We were very disappointed that the CD didn't include music from the first movie in the series, The World Race.The song 'Hot' by Smashmouth is our son's favorite [...]. Plus, he knew all the words. The songs in the Acceleracers movies are not as easy for kids to follow or relate to the movie with [...].Hot Wheels did a dis-service with the Acceleracer movies by forgetting the age of their viewers.All that said, our son likes the songs, but doesn't ask for them anywhere near as much as we thought he would since he loves the movies so much, but he does ask for 'Hot' from the World Race.UPDATE 06/2009: Our son STILL watches this series of movies when he can! Well worth the investment."
4,music cd,"The cd it self was in fine order, it was not for me it was for my son and he is happy with it, have not listened to it my self though.The service it self was not good though, first time ordering from amazon and most likely the last, a month and ahalf to finally recieve, was suppose to be a christmas present never made it, and got no compensation offered for the inconvenience after needing to wait additional time for you to send out a second disc. First impression was awful!!!"
1,"poor quality, not what they used to be","I have owned Quiklok products for years and the stands that I do own are very solid and well built. Back then, the stands were made in Italy. Now they're made in China, and the quality difference is obvious. First, the weld quality is very poor compared to the older stands that I already own. Second, the stand does not sit level; in fact, one leg is almost a half inch shorter than the rest.There is no way I am going to put a rack case of expensive gear on a stand that wobbles like the WS540 that I just received."
5,For the Polka Lover,My Dad used to play Jimmy Sturr on 8 Track tape. I loved the energetic style of instrumentation and play. I finally bought a Jimmy Sturr MP3 download for my iPod and I love it. There is not one boring or dramatic song on the entire album.
3,Not up to par. Feels like it was written by someone else.,The first two books were on a par with s. m. stirling's The Change series. This one reads like it is from a different author altogether. Lost is the suspense and well turned prose.I hope the next one is better.
5,David Valentine,If you like the Vampire Earth series or if you like E.E. Knight then you will enjoy this book
3,"Good Enough, But Not Up to Snuff","The first two books in this series were a few paragraphs short of perfection. This one is much further off the mark, yet is well worth reading if you've read the first two.We pick up Valentine about a year after 'Cat' ended, and he's now an undercover agent for the resistance whose mission is to get to Jamaica to recover a 'long-lost' weapon for use against the Kurian order. The book starts off as a sea-faring adventure, but then moves into rescue-mode on the islands. What was missing for me in this outing was the suspense. I never once wondered if Valentine or his friends were going to survive. I also missed the way the other books jumped ahead in time by weeks or months at a time, as this book was padded by a few too many details about island life under the Kurian order.Do not read this if you're new to the series, but DO read it if you're a fan of the first two books."
3,"Still worth reading, but....","I kinda had to push myself to get through this installment. Valentine felt emotionally distant and the story was more like a series of shorts than one, long tale. They were good enough, but the overall effect was choppy.I had the feeling as I got further into the book that this is a connecting piece -- a long setup for a good finale, I hope. I'd really think better of this author if he would tell one long over-all story well (a la J.K. Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkien) than if he drags the characters and situations out in a series that never ends...or satisfies."
2,Pleasure Cruise in the Carribean,"This episode of David Valentine has him taking a gunboat to Haiti to find some great weapon. Along the way he has some rather boring encounters. This novel is basically a set up for the next one. There isn't a lot of action, and no suspense at all. Valentine wins all encounters either by luck, lying, or killing. There is never the sense that he is really in any danger.Most disturbing is some of his actions. Two scenes have him doing things that make him as bad as the Kurians, and are made worse because he doesn't really have to do either of them.Book 3 is a terrible letdown after the first two."
1,Very disappointed,"This product looks great, and when you open it, it seems great. But it isn't at all. I should have listened to everyone else. The ends where the balls screwed on were so mis-shapen and sharp, that it cut my belly ring hole when I tried to put it in. I tried cutting it, but that didn't do anything either. Now I have to wait for it to heal. Do not waste your money."
1,Ow,"This item took three weeks to get to me, it was missing the extra balls, and it gave me an infection.I personally didn't like it and thought that it was cheap."
3,Nice Pictorial . . . .,"Very well done pictorial collection, but don't expect much more. The photo captions give a very shallow insight and historical account of this great race car. Much of the meager text is a rehash of information already out there pertaining to the Chaparral's. True Can Am and Sport car race fans will find this book disappointing and lacking from any kind of technical or informational point of view.Still, for the Can Am fan, whether hard core or those of casual interest, this book is a must have."
3,Ok watch,"You get what you see. It is an ok watch, looks nice, etc. However it's typical Fossil quality, nothing special, band links aren't solid, etc. But I suppose it's a good value for the money. A watch you could wear every day, and not feel too bad if you bang it up and replace it in a few years."
2,Insufficient driving power. Poorly engineered,Not enough tork. Bits fall out easily. Try another product...there has to be a better one.
3,Master of the Game,"I did not realize that the book was taped on cassettes rather than CDs.Otherwise, the book was well read, abridged, and accurate. I boughtit to listen to before I listened to the next book in the sequence."
5,"""THE MASTER AT HIS MASTERY""","Sidney fans will agree when i say that no one writes the way Sidney writes......The Master Of The Game was the first book i read of Sidney and my! my! what a book!Its almost more than 12 years since i have read this book but its still fresh( i have read it a couple of times!) And i am sure that i am gonna read it many more times.......Sidney keeps you hooked and glued to his books, to be very very frank he doesnt let you have much of a choice......I have made so many friends of mine read Sidney. I dont want them to miss out his works, but i will not say the same about his latter books .....some of them have really disappointed me..... but i guess you cannot please all the people, all the time......"
5,GREAT!!,You haven't read this book yet? What are you waiting for.I have this book and have bought it for my friends. They all have given this book 5 stars. Page turner. Can't put it down.
3,Guilty pleasure,"This book is a guilty pleasure. It reads like an 80s primetime soap such as Dynasty or Dallas. Not bad, but not good. An evil twin for crying out loud? Gimme a break. But I finished it anyway and the ending was a (slight) twist. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could."
3,Dissapointed by Most Characters,"Yes, I found this book intriguing, and hard to put down. Still, each character disappointed me individually. I was rooting for Jamie, and he became a cold-hearted creep. I was rooting for Kate, and she became a manipulative witch that ruined lives. I was rooting for Alexandra, and she never became smart-stayed unbelievably naive. I was out for Eve, and she had a Samson attack--lose her beauty, lose her evil. It was quite frustrating. I enjoyed the storyline up until a ridiculous lobotomy (does anyone REALLY do that to their kid?!?). After that it got a bit OTT for me. Still, there is a complexity to this book that holds it together, and by then you've read so far you may as well finish it--then you'll wish for a different outcome.If you are looking for a read that will delight and frustrate you, with an extremely powerful and manipulative woman at the helm, than this read is for you."
5,Couldn't put it down.,This book should come with a warning label. I found this book on a used book shelf at a hotel on my vacation. I couldn't do another thing until I had completely read this book. The same thing happened the first time I read the book years ago. It is a timeless story that hooks you and just sucks you in until it finally spits you out again at the end. The book was made into two DVD's that are also quite good. WARNING: Don't pick it up unless you have the time to read it.
4,A Good Book,"Am enthralling book with a long but very interesting story line ranging over four generations. A book worth reading by all Sidney Sheldon Fans.If you want a book you simply cannot put down, go to Sidney Sheldon."
5,awesome read,This is the book that really got me into reading! I love Sydney Sheldon and havesince read every one of his book!
5,Wow,"This book held me from start to finish. My boyfriend recommended it to me and I didn't hesitate, I'm glad he mentioned it to me. The twists and turns and the moments of total shock kept me on my seat. Great book!"
2,Master of the Game,For me this book was very hard to get into and so I never finished it. I was disappointed in this book. It did not live up to Sidney Sheldons writting.
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!,I read this book about 5 years ago in college. I still remember how I felt for Kate. The best heroine in any Sheldon book. I have been recommending this book for years and everyone who has read it has loved it..
5,one of my fav books,"i love this book. I could read it again and again. This book goes through the lifespan of a family from the 1800 when there was no money to modern day time when the family has a lot of money and now problems. Well written, very enjoyable, I think this is sheldons best book. Love the others too!!! Put this on your list!"
1,No one worth liking.,There was only one character worth liking in the book and she basically got screwed over. There were just too many characters with no redeeming qualities. I finished the book but it left a very bad taste in my mouth.
1,Total garbage,"Fascinatingly bad. This has replaced The Davinci Code as the worst book I've read in recent years. Predictable cliche plot, flat characterisation, psychotic heroes, pedestrian writing. Absolute rubbish."
4,Story writing at its best,"I downloaded a sample of this book as the South African element interrested me. The history of the Diamond and Gold rush was fascinating and I could relate to the tough heat of the summer and cold of the winters . The story takes you from the 1800 hundreds to modern day and spans three generations . From Rags to Riches , its worth the read.I have purchased the follow on to this book"
2,Struggle,The book took to long to come to it's conclusion. It was unnecessary and at times fairly boring. It was by far the most disappointing Sidney Sheldon book I've read.
5,A MUST READ!!!!!,"This book is absolutely splendid! This is my very first book of Sidney Sheldon but it won't be my last. This book had so many twist and turns That I found that I was unable to stop reading! There is history, romance, thrill, murder and unbelievable excitement!!! I LOVED IT!!!"
3,"Not as good as a ""Heavy Duty"" drill should be...","The Milwaukee 5378-20 works perfect for light applications and it does well in concrete. My first one burned up suddenly while drilling a 1/2 inch hole in wood with an auger bit, I guess it was some sort of manufacturing defect. My second one has been working fine, very good in concrete, good in steel and wood, but it does not seem like the drill has too much power. If you look for a true ""Heavy Duty"" drill, don't go with that one. But for most things around the house, this drill works just fine."
1,I expected better,"My Milwaukee 5378-20 1/2"" Hammer Drill took a dump. It's 14 years old - I expected a longer life, because I did not use it all that much. Some years barely any use.It would not allow me to go into reverse and it only had one speed - FULL. The controller switch is fried. It's a less than $25 part (+ freight) but when I opened it up, the motor is near toasted. The gears are very worn.......oh yeah the hammer feature never quite ever worked all that well.WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!! Made in Germany. I should trust my instincts - the whole case is made of plastic not like my pop's Milwaukee."
2,"ok, but bad handle","I've had this drill for a few years and find the motor a bit weak, but adequate. The only real problem I've had is the handle that mounts on the gear case. The plastic gear case has three little indent to mate with indents in the plastic side handle. Tightening the side handle as much as I can I still can't keep it from slipping when drilling large (2.5"") holes in fir joists. Once it starts to slip the plastic breaks and then you've had it. Unfortunately for me, the drill is fairly useless without the side handle. Hence only two stars."
3,A Very Different Book,"This book reminded me in some ways of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, except there was no overiding message or inspiration to be derived from it. Instead it was an aimless meandering of writing. I guess that was the intention of the author all along, while the writer traveled along a stretch of England on the eastern coastline.What saves this book is that the endless string of tangents the author goes off on are interesting. They are usually history topics, but not all of them, and most of them are thought provoking and even educational.I only wish there was more of an underlying point to the book. I was waiting for the author to pull it all together to a higher level. I was waiting for some sort of summary or message to emerge but it never happened.I recommend this title, but while you are reading it, don't fall into the trap that I did of asking, ""What's the point of this book?"" There isn't one."
5,R.I.P. Herr Sebald,The man who brought us such moving books as this and whose trips throughout his books were often on trains or walking was tragically killed in a car accident. I can only say he is a must read. Often writing about the aftermath of World War 2 his voice was also millennial in it existential dread.
5,Walking & Thinking,"An excellent book, an inspiration for ramblers in the country-side when you get tired of looking at the scenery and wish to expand your thought lines."
3,"ok, but not for thick wire",Ok plugs but difficult to attach when using a 12 gauge wire. It is on its price tag: you get what you paid for.
5,Great product but pricey,Great product but pricey. They are a bit long when pushing my unit back on the shelf but they are built well and you need to watch the dimensions and plan appropriately when using these with a shallow shelf. Great quality product.
2,Plugs too loose,"This type of plug is more difficult to wire and less secure than the compression type. These particular plugs were of uneven diameter, and some fit too loosely. This is not much of a problem at the speaker end, where gravity works in you favor. But when a loose plug is horizontal, it is prone to slippage. This is a problem at the amplifier (output) end, especially if you move the unit to add another component.There also was a shipping problem with this particular seller."
4,Almost perfect,"First off let me say that the lamp and it's shade were purchased in Burgundy and they arrived in perfect condition & matched. The base was bubble wrapped to within an inch of it's life so it would have taken alot to damage it lol. The shade came wrapped in thin plastic, no damage but it could have been packaged in a sturdier box. Another possible is that they need to put FRAGILE stickers on the boxes.The shade and lamp are perfect for what I needed it for. A simple end table size/type of lamp for my living room. My one and only complaint about the lamp itself is that the cord is on the short side but that seems to be the norm for lamps these days. I wish they cords were a tad bit longer. I don't like having the cord stretched along the wall for 3ft or so. I will more than likely order an extension cord so it can run along the floorboards instead."
4,Worth the money,"I went for Black ones, they look amazing. The only thing which i didn't like initially was they are much bigger thn they look in display pic. But over period of time they grow on you."
1,warehouse deal lamp,"Lamp was pictured and described as burgundy lamp with burgundy shade.I got a green lamp with burgundy shade.I got it cheap,from Warehouse Deals, not worth the expense of returning.I'll just sell it at my next garage sale.So beware of Warehouse DealsI have ordered several things from the warehouse and this is the first problem.I will also add that I paid only $11.00 and I will have no problem recovering my money."
2,not satisfied,"I received this product recently and when I opened the box, i discovered that the shade was broken. The inside brackets that hold the shade were broken. The lamp itself is very nice, but would have been nicer with the shade.D. Dellapenna"
1,Not what we expected,The lamps were advertised as burgundy with silver accents. We received lamps with gold accents. Lamps were very light weight and of extremely poor quality.Would not recommed.
4,"Big Lamp, BIG Shade","This is a BIG lamp, especially the shade. It has the largest shade of any table lamp in my home and seems too big for the lamp. Also, the shade arrived wrinkled in one area. In short I don't like the item as much as I thought I would."
3,A good value.,"I purchased this six CD set mainly for the six previously released programs. These decent programs include Math Blaster Pre Algebra, but does NOT include Math Blaster Algebra. It is a little annoying that these programs are not on stand-alone CDs. You have to run the main program from the first CD, select the ""extra"" program and switch the CD when prompted. I am happy with the product, and would buy it again."
4,Good read,"I read it quickly. Good book. Would be a good read aloud for grades aged kids, maybe fourth to sixth grade."
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent book, though the ending does leave you hanging a bit and asking yourself questions you'll never know the answers too. Great action and description, real life drama that you can relate to as you read, easily forming a picture in your mind. Often it seemed to be not a fictional story but a true account. I appreciated that that book did have conflict between the characters but that the conflicts were address showing problem solving skills. Great read for boys but girls will enjoy it as well."
5,Kensuke's Review,Have you ever dreamt of being on a tropical island? How about being stuck on one? If so this is the book for you. In Kensuke's Kingdom a boy named Michael falls off a ship called the Peggy Sue with his dog Stella and washes up on a deserted island- at least that's what he thinks until they meet the mysterious Kensuke!!This book is full of exciting twists and turns as Kensuke and Michael form a bonding friendship that will last forever. If you like the idea of this story of survival then sail on over to your nearest library or bookstore. Will Michael make if off the island or not? Happy reading!!
4,Kensuke's Kingdom,Easy to read book with positive relationship between child and adult. Plenty to think and talk about. Suitable to read aloud at school to 10/11 year olds.
4,Kensuke's Kingdom,I thought this book was exciting. It was also very interesting. It is very detailed. You never want to put this book down. I would give it two thumbs up!
4,I hated the ending,"I love the way Michael Morpurgo writes about such real emotions in a way that is accessible to both adults and children. This book is no different, in that way. I listened to this story on CD. The story was great, enthralling, well-written and well-read, in line with all the other reviews.The ending of this story was abrupt, and left so many questions unanswered. I thought there was something wrong with the audio CD, because it ended in such a strange place, and had to go back to check that it was actually the end of the story.I loved it, but felt like I had been left hanging."
2,More for boys than girls,"We were given this book in school to read at our own pace. When we were finished we were to right a two page review on what we thought and the basic idea of the story. I thought piece of cake, read the book and write two pages about it. It was the hardest review I ever had to do. When I was reading the start of the book it was really boring. But I thought all books are at the start. But I never thought it could last right till the end of the book.So a month later we handed in our reviews and the class came to a conclusion that the book was more for boys. Not one girl in the class enjoyed the book in the slightest. So our teacher decided to let the girls pick the next book and we decided on Holes. It was enjoyed by the whole class and everyone had their review the week after. More for boys into sailing and likes to read adventure books."
1,shark kill,"the picture was bad and faded in and out hard to watch, it looks like it could be a very good movie but i had to turn it off."
3,What episodes are on this set?,"Hello,can anyone post the episode titles of this box please?I would very much appreciate it.I've got the Season 1 Vol.1 (5 disks) and 2 (5 disk). The last title on Vol.2 is The Case of The Rolling Bones.Thank you,Richard"
1,studio loses,"I was looking forward to getting Season 3, but I refuse to be held hostage to the predatory practices of the studio releasing these shows. They dribble out a few episodes at a time, fewer episodes each disc, all the while they raise the price. It is not as if there is an increase in costs of this next season. The entire Season 3 should be offered at this price or less. I refuse to be ripped off and I hope everyone else will join me in boycotting these tactics. Hamilton Burger virtually always lost, but this time the studio is the loser."
1,How Disappointing - Only 12 Episodes,"This is just too sad that only 12 episodes are included in this set. Season 3 had a total of 25 and the decision to break the set into 2 volumes is just criminal. Although I had pre-ordered this set I've now cancelled the order to protest the price of $70.00 a season. I do love Perry Mason and only wish the studios will take heed. Even though $50 a season would be expensive it would most definitely be more in line. To think Murder She Wrote is less than $40 a season as well as Matlock & Magnum PI, there is no reason to rip off the consumer that enjoys Perry Mason. Who knows if there will even be a s Volume 2."
1,Product and service,"Excellent remastering of a 50-year old TV series, and prompt shipment. I am looking forward to the next episodes issue."
3,Not in color,The movie is good but not in color as advertised. I would have enjoyed the movie better if it had been in color as advertised.
1,Me Too,"Mason: ""Isn't it true Paramount that you became exceedingly greedy? And didn't this festering contemptible greed lead you to kill a perfectly good and decent product. Isn't it true Paramount? Isn't it?!""Paramount: ""Yes! Yes! We did it...we killed it... we killed it...we wanted the money...[sobbing]... we wanted all their hard earned money!"""
1,Price Must Be a Joke,"One StarThus far, I have purchased the lousy half year Perry Mason sets. They beat the episodes I recorded from Hallmark TV with 8 minutes cut-out from every episode. But, at this price, it is an easy no deal call. HBO is also infamous for over pricing their DVDs, but at least they are using some of the DVD revenues to offset the original production costs. For Perry Mason, revenues are all gravy.I have learned one thing about DVD pricing over the years, if you wait long enough, these over-priced sets are put on sale at the steepest discounts. I am waiting."
3,Great Show but Poor Quality DVD's,"Perry Mason - Season 3, Vol. 1I pre-ordered this set as I'm a Perry Mason fan. There were scratches on all three of the DVD's I received. The scratches were circular or spiral a quarter of the way around the DVD. Also, the DVD's seem lower in quality compared to previous seasons of Perry Mason as when I held up a DVD to the light, I could see right through the DVD surface.I sent Amazon an e-mail and they sent a second set - all three DVD's on this set where also scratched; the scratches were similar to the scratches on the first set I had received. I decided to return this set and asked for a refund. I hope Paramount uses better quality DVD's for the next season."
1,"Perry, Innocent-Paramount, GUILTY as charged.","As everyone else here has already noted, the release schedule on this, the most sophisticated of all 1950's television, has been slow and torturous. Most viewers who enjoyed this originally will be dead by the time they finish releasing this. If they finish releasing it.Look at the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart Shows, both widely accepted as two of the best comedies ever on commercial TV, both stalled from further releases at the fourth season mark.Of course the other side of boycotting, as has been suggested in more than a few reviews here, might just make it easier for Paramount to stop releasing them at all if no one's buying.There are certainly more important things in life to worry about, but it's a shame to see something of such high quality being so poorly handled."
3,What are they thinking?,"Anyone hoping for a conforming set can ALREADY forget it! Only season three and they CHANGED the packaging. So the sets are overpriced, only half a season, VERY slow to be released and, now, they don't even match each other!"
3,CHANGED PACKAGING,"Why did CBS/Paramount have to change the packaging. In addition to agreeing with the other reviews that these issues are taking too long and are too expensive, now they've COMPLETELY CHANGED THE PACKAGING!!! It's disappointing to not be able to display this ""collection"" since its a mish-mash of packaging..."
1,"Price too high, releases too slow, Boycotting","I agree, the price for the number of episodes is too high and the release dates are too slow. I will wait and buy used."
3,too little for too much,I am also disappointed in the packaging and the price for what was offered in this release of Perry MasonI paid too much for too little!
1,I Vote NO! ...but will they stop producing the DVDs,"So, if I and others like me stop purchasing the DVDs because of the much higher than average per episode cost, will they stop producing them? I am guessing that they will not. Of course, I have no idea of how many sets of the first two years they've actually sold. But, judging by the used price, I am thinking that the Perry Mason series is very popular.No, I am thinking they thought they could get us to plunk down the money regardless of the cost. However, these Hollywood producer types again underestimate the free market system. I'm willing to wait them out."
5,Perry is God Mason,"Yes we are short changed with only half of Season 3 in this set, but what the hell, this is one of the all time great actors, each show has a similar format/formula, and now and again Perry is off to the country.Each show is a classic, Perry is superb as is Hamilton, Perry was once asked do you ever lose a case he replied never on a Saturday, that was when the show was screened.I cant wait for Season 3 part 2, keep them rolling along, I was in heaven, and the girls so bewitching!!"
1,Wait This One Out,"I love the Perry Mason series. Brings back so many memories. At the age of 65 and at the rate they are releasing them I will have ""crossed over"" and I'll be looking for Raymond Burr.13 episodes for 34.99 ... I'm afraid I have more worthwhile uses for my social security check. I'll be looking for this at the Library. No more cash up front to the company producing this video. They need to wake up and it's up to us to wake them up."
5,Favorite TV Attorney - Even Today,"This show is awesome! Perry, Della, Paul, Hamilton & Tragg make a wonderful team. Sometimes I can guess who done it and sometimes I cannot. Great show!"
1,ONE star for the release and price!,"Five stars for the show!These studios have some raw nerve!The price onthese sets are now up $10 to $15 per release!Releases that are only HALFseasons to boot!Worse,think back!Season One had 39 episodes,20 and 19per half or volume release!In case you dont know,Season 3 only has 26total episodes - Twenty -Six!That means 13 stinking episodes per volume!ENOUGH is ENOUGH!Boycott this garbage.This Season Three should bereleased as ONE full season or the retail price should be $30 - not $50!!"
2,Rip Off,"I know I'm supposed to write about the product. But as other people have pointed out, the price keeps going up. This time you get only 3 DVDs for $35. Being a fan of this show, it hurts to see Paramount rip us off like this. I would probably wait for a while and buy it when the price goes down."
4,Gives some hydration and relief,"I used this balm after two chemical peels. The first stung and the product help to sooth the skin after the peel was rinsed and neutralized. The second peel did not have any effect on my skin. However, I still used this balm to help the skin heel, if needed.This product is thick. It is similar in consistency to chap-stick. It helps to rub it into your fingertips before applying to your face. Otherwise it is harder to apply to sensitive skin."
5,"The Hundred Secret Senses , good book, excellent follow-up.","Amy Tan does a wonderful job in this novel. a different twist than The Joy Luck Club, but still a great read. It took me about a day to finish so for those of you who are fast readers, this is not one to take on a long trip when you need to read to pass time. perfect for a rainy afternoon. Can be a tear-jerker though. Contains a great chinese story, mixed with the characters american lives. Get this book."
5,"Mesmerizing - a smorgasbord of poignant, poetic images","In this book, as well as in ""The Kitchen God's Wife,"" Amy Tan reveals to us her acute understanding of the Chinese psyche and culture. She is such a gifted writer and infuses her tales with storytelling magic. The reader is effectively rendered ""present"" in just about every compelling, atmospheric scene."
4,Excellent storytelling,"Olivia (Libby-ah) has a Chinese half-sister. Kwan, who has many idiosyncracies that make her an interesting, yet extremely annoying, person. Can a person love and hate their own sister? Kwan's ""yin eyes"" allow her to see ghosts or dead people who are in the ""land of yin"", unable to pass to another world. She tells Olivia about her experiences in another life, ultimately making Olivia face the truth she has already suspected. Meet Miss Banner, Pastor Amen, Nunumu, Doctor Too Late, Yiban and General Cape, and Simon. Excellent storytelling, touching and funny."
5,"A marvelous, mysterious, completly wonderful book","This books is one of my favorites. Amy Tan's writing of Kwan and Olivia make you believe in what sisterhood should be, after worlds, and every thing else in this book. I felt as if I were in China, and in San Francisco the entire book. It took me only three days to read and I'm definetly ready for more of Tan's books. Not only was the moral of the book great, but the ending of the book was the best ending ever."
5,Another 5 cheers for Amy Tan,In this novel Amy Tan makes the unbelievable believable. I have not finnished it yet - only another 50 pages to go but I don't want it to end.
4,The Hundred Secret Senses by Amy Tan,"I learn so much about other places, i.e. the west coast, China from Amy Tan's writing. I can feel the thoughts of each person and the use of magical ideas can lead me to the universe. I cannot say I can understand all the meanings but it touches me completely."
4,Emotionally satisfying,"I bought this book over a year ago, but just could not get into it. Both Kwan and Olivia were annoying to me, albeit in different ways. And the book seemed to be another Amy Tan rehash of the clash between first and second generation Chinese. I finally tried reading it again recently, and for some reason, I was swept away. You just have to get past the first 50 pages to be in sync with the story structure. This time, I loved the characters and their belief that loved ones don't die, they simply become part of another sensory world. As for Amy Tan writing the same old things again, I guess it's really not a fair criticism. John Grisham writes the same book over and over again. Sue Grafton only writes crime novels featuring the same character. So you can't very well expect Amy Tan to start writing science fiction, for example. Overall, then, it's a not a bad way to spend an evening."
4,Good stage setting,"The stories and plots about ghost and incarnation are quite common in both modern and classic chinese novels. This attempt to use the idea again into a more ""International"" manner is quite interesting. The memories of Kwan, Libbya's travel to China, the swing between present and previous life events give the author many opportunities to illustrate different contrasts: American/Chinese cultures, Christianity/Taoism, luxury/povelty. However, I think the description of chinese rituals and beliefs on funeral and afterlife should receive a more in-depth treatment."
4,the story creates a vivid picture,"Amy Tan did an exquiste job in writing this book. She explains the traditions and believes of her sister Kwan. Not only did she create a vivid picture but also the use of her chinese broken english incorportated in the story to give the reader a sense of how chinese people talk. I would reccomend this book, which is interesting and eliquently potrays the way Olivia ( the main character) views her sister and of life."
2,lost the sparkle somewhat,"I've never missed Amy's book. I'm finding her book rather palatable & heart warming. To me, this book seems to have lost the X factor that her previous works were able to produce. Could it be that Amy was compelled to obligate her contract to write another book for her publisher in such a short span of time? I'm convinced that Amy could have done better. There's nothing wrong for her to dwell on female characters as been criticised by some readers. Isn't it Chinese saying that we only do what we know best? Even though this is not her best book yet, I am still looking forward to read her next offering. USA is proud to have someone like her. Girl Power!"
2,it was really boring,"i think that this book was real boring and it was real stupid because there wasn't any excitement. The plot really sucks. One thing that it made it worst was it seems like that it kept on changing the subject. it kept mentioning that her sister Kwan have yin eyes, i think that we would get the idea by the first one hundred time she mentioned it. why don't they do something more interesting"
4,Beautifully written--makes one believe in the world of yin.,"Once again, Tan has succeeded in weaving together so many lives and revealing them to the reader in a way that enlightens. One can't help but understand what Kwan means by the secret senses even though the explanation is tangible and intangible at the same time. I loved following Kwan and Libby-ah into an unfamiliar (to me) world--it was like I was there in the village with them."
3,This book is an book about sisterhood,"The book was based on two sisters with the same father butdifferent mothers. They come from two different worlds. Olivia,which was born and raised in the United States and Kwan who was born and raised in China. Kwan come to America as her father's death wish. When she come, Olivia didn't really get along with her because she did weird things. Kwan could see ghosts and Olivia thought that was weird. All the kids at school would make fun of Olivia because of Kwan."
5,"I couldn't put it down, and I can't stop thinking about it","I read this book almost a year ago. And for some strange reason I find myself thinking about almost every day. Tan writes in a way that trasports you to places within the book. It was filled with good, bad, hard, fun, sorrow, and beauty. One of my top 10 fav books read in the last decade."
4,too high on price,"I have to question why you can get a paperback copy of this for a dollar, but the Kindle version is 10 dollars? I hope Amazon will get with the program and start offering these previously published books at a lower price. I can often do better going to flea markets. I realize there's alot of classics for free and cheaper books for Kindle, so I hope the selection will continue to expand."
1,"blah, blah blah..","that's all olivia, the main character, seemed to be saying. Olivia was cold, her husband made of cardboard, Kwan was annoying, and the way China was described definitely took it off my must-visit list. I won't waste your time with the details, but, as much as I like books that discuss the cultural aspects of a culture other than U.S.A., this book was far too long and seemed to be repeating itself. a three page short story, maybe, but a book? no.Final Verdict:I was glad when it was over."
2,It's all the same!,"How many times can Amy Tan write the same story? I've read Joy Luck Club, The Kitchen God's Wife, and the beginning and end of this one. The themes are all the same: female Chinese Americans coming to terms with their identities through a female relative. It made for ONE interesting, well-written story, but it stretched pretty thin over three novels. Also, isn't anyone else concerned that all the characters grew up in San Francisco, but never encountered black or Latino people? Shouldn't it happen in at least one of the books? Never mind, make that one book."
1,very disappointing!!,"Usually I enjoy reading Amy Tan's books, but I wasn't to thrill with this one. I had to stop on page 79 and to remove it off my book list.I felt that this book didn't have a flow to it. It kept going from one scenario to another. IMO, I felt this story was disjointed."
5,Something Chinese Americans should be proud of,"I can't say how good I feel inside when I read Amy Tan's books. As a Chinese immigrant, I have always felt extremely proud when I read something I can relate to. The old lores and stories that Kwan told in this book, made me cry, not simply because I miss home, but because Amy Tan told them with a sense of pride. I shall look up to Amy Tan, all Chinese Americans should."
4,Two Stories or One,"In The Hundred Secret Senses, Amy Tan tells us the story of two sisters, Olivia who has been raised in America and Kwan who joins the family straight from China after their father's death. Kwan begins to tell Olivia her ""Yin Stories"" or shall we say her conversations with the dead. The book splits in two different stories, not only do we read about Olivia and Kwan, but Kwan tells us the story of two 19th century women Ms. Banner and Nunumu, but if you are patient and can wait till the two stories eventually are interwoven.I loved Kwan she was such a great character. She seemed so friendly and there was many times that she had me laughing out loud especially with her use of the English Language.I didn't find this book as good as The Joy Luck Club or The Kitchen God's wife but I did find it enjoyable and worth the time to read to the end. It was the relationship between the two sisters that held me interest through out the book and I loved the way both stories became one at the end."
5,"A haunting tale of love, hope and second chances","With this novel, Amy Tan has created a world in which ghosts drift among the living, looking for lost loved ones and righting past wrongs. I loved the descriptions of rural China, and Kwan's frizzy perm and mispronounciations made for a wonderfully touching character. The dialogue was humourous and real, and the interwoven stories of the past and present were arfully done. But best of all, the climax sent shivers down my spine and tears down my face. In all her novels, Amy Tan writes of hope -- we can only wish to have the kind of personal epiphany that Olivia experiences at the end."
3,"More Kwan, Less Libyah","This was an okay read (well, actually I listened to it), but I was more interested in Kwan's telling of her previous life in China than I was of Olivia's story with her husband and his excess emotional baggage. And the ending got me very confused, with the caves and all. Was an ok book right up until then. The ending should have been written better."
5,Chinese kisses,"The book was a wonderful read. Having spent some years in South East Asia and China and having relatives and loyal friends of Chinese decent I can attest that Amy Tan did a good job weaving the past and present into her circle tale. When I was small my relatives decribed themselves as ""white/ yellow Russians"" instead of Han,s. This was to escape the racism of the white australia policy of the day. The Hundred Secret Senses transported me back to past times and that solid generous gentle feeling which comes from sharing some of one's life with the Chinese. Just loved Tan's Kwan and I have known, lived and worked with a hundred Kwan's. The mannerisms, attitudes to life, work ethic, inescapable fate and the notion perserverence as a duty are all true. Tan,s book truely evoked a hundred secret memories and reconnected me with yin (and yang) ancestors.Highly recommend this book."
3,Yin World,"I enjoyed Joy Luck Club very much and decided to read this one since the good reviews it has. It started well, with funny statements and awkward moments between the sisters.It would have been nice to if there was a bit more dimension for Olivia. I did symphatize with Kwan but I could not help hating Olivia, who, unfortunately, was the narrator of the story. Her so self-centered ego was understandable but her attitude towards Kwan was more than I could bear. She acted like a little kid till almost the end.Perhaps that was what Ms. Tan had intended but I just didn't enjoy it as much as JLC. Although I liked Kwan's vision of Yin world and her way of speaking, I hated Olivia and didn't care what she thought or did. Perhaps it's just because the book is too long for Olivia's narrow point of view."
2,The Hundred Secret Senses by Amy Tan,"Sorry - although I normally really like Amy Tan's books, this one left me cold. I could not get into it. Tried twice. Maybe you'll have better luck."
4,Amy Tan is a tremendous weaver of tales.,"This book was given to me as a Christmas gift, and I was afeared to read it. I thought that, since Ms. Tan's ""Joy Luck Club"" (which I haven't read) was a best seller (I have no faith in the reading tastes of the American public), and since I had heard that her stories deal with relationships between women, this book would be some lovely-dovey, weepy pile of goo. Much to my delight, the book is simply a well-told tale, and an excellent one at that. I highly recommend this book to anyone, male or female, who likes good stories. That's what this book contains,good stories, and, as I said, well told. Attitude adjustments can be very rewarding."
5,Twists where you're not expecting them...,"The Hundred Secret Senses refers to Olivia's (the narrator's) Chinese half sister Kwan and her ability to see yin people, people who have died. Kwan came to live with Olivia's mother and siblings when Olivia was 6 and Kwan almost 18. Kwan became her caretaker, which Olivia resented, but through Kwan she learned the Chinese language and much about the Chinese culture. It's only as an adult that Olivia can truly come to appreciate Kwan, when she steps in to help Olivia piece together her failing marriage. And only then does Olivia finally see what a loyal friend Kwan is and has always been.The ending is a surprising tear jerker that I wasn't suspecting. Very good, very worth reading. Highly recommended."
3,Not the best Amy Tan book.,"I really like the writing style of Amy Tan and even though this book was frustrating at some points, she engages the reader like no other writer can.PROS: Her dialog is funny and real, and her descriptions of China are rich.CONS: I didn't like some of the animal cruelty (and human cruelty), and I want to know if Kwan was real!The ending left me with more questions than answers, but it was an interesting ride there."
2,Didn't I read this before?,"I just finished ""The Bonesetter's Daughter"". I thought it was fantastic. I read it in two days. I loved it. I went to get another Amy Tan book and chose this one. Seems like the same book. There is always one character who, for one contrived reason or the other, sometimes very contrived, speaks broken English (on the order of ""no tickee, no shirtee""). There is always a middle-aged woman (45-50) married with no kids. We always go back in time to China and forward to the present. there is always a culture clash with the Americans.I loved all of these things in ""The Bonesetter's Daughter"" and would highly recommend that book, but I don't want to keep reading the same book over and over."
1,Here we go once again,"I borrowed this book from the library, and am glad I did. How many times can Tan write the same story? How many times can the same stereotypes be repeated over and over again? From reading her books, one certainly gets the impression that she has an intense dislike for Asian men. Surely out of several billion Asian men, there must be at least one decent one! Read the Joy Luck Club if you want to read Tan. It's her best and at least it's original--all the rest are just dull reruns of the same old same old."
1,Please Recycle for the Next Book,"A public service announcement: if you are a well-read Eli curious about life in China, don't waste your time with this book. This is the same recycled mother-daughter-sister drivel she turns out every couple of years. If you are a middle-aged woman who doesn't go out much, do what you like. Amy Tan, in my opinion, is only good for one book (imagine Mitchell writing more than one)."
1,This book sucked!,"There was no point to this book. I could not figure out what this story was about. It was boring, confusing, and pointless. Do not read this book if you don't have to! If you want to read a book by Amy Tan, I suggest that you read ""The Joy Luck Club"" or ""The Kitchen God's Wife."" These two books have more meaning than ""Hundred Secret Senses"" had."
3,great costume for a 10 year old,this costume serviced my 10 year old who doesn't really want to dress up for Halloween anymore very well. he was happy with the red accent strips. The vendor who sold us the lighted sword was exceptionally pleasant and sent us a new one without asking for the old (broken in shipping) one back to make the Halloween deadline.
5,my ninja grandson,"I bought this suit for my 9 yr. old grandson and it was an instant hit, he absolutely loves it. I asked him to rate it from 1-10, he said it was a 10 plus!"
1,Flimsy Costume,My son wore this costume twice and the fabric started tearing and unraveling easily. The fabric is flimsy and most of it is not stitched properly. I would not recommend purchasing it.
5,AnacondaJack,Outstanding clamps for one-person operations. But you need more than one set (of two) for normal cabinets. I bought two sets (four clamps) and thinking about more.
1,"Nice design, poor quality","Broke on first use. When I received product I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the ""clamps"", They were more substantial in size than I had expected. I was building some drawers out of 5/8"" stock and decided I'd see if the clamps would support the joints (just to see how they worked). The 1st attempt at attaching the the corner snapped the top plastic piece. I put the product back in the plastic case and call Amazon for a return. They promptly e-mailed me a RA# as well as supplied a prepaid return OK. Very disapointed with product, but at least pleased with Amazon."
3,Not easy to use,"Bought two pairs of clamps to use for bookcase. Could not put the clamps on the corner that I want. It's to hard to put in 3/4"" plywood and it leaves clamp marks on the corner. After having too much trouble to put in the plywood, returned it.I'll try other device."
5,I wish I thought of this,"These clamps are great. I am new to the wood working scene and have trouble joining two pieces of wood with the clamps that I have now. I was watching a Ron Hazeelton helpful tip video ([...]) and that is where I discovered these clamps.I am currently making a container out of 3/4 inch oak plywood for our kitchen trash receptacle. It is very difficult trying to hold these heavy pieces of plywood together to glue and nail.I won't be having that problem any longer.Today I laid out the four pieces of the box on my bench, using these clamps the box came together and was held securely. It simple and it works, it like having another set of hands. I am glad I bought two sets."
4,P R A C T I C A L !!!!!!!,"This is a very practical appliance or device; the pity, limited in thickness; sometimes you need to support thicker pieces of wood."
2,Nice but ....,"They are nice and work fine but one of each pair I bought (the ones with the black outside) came broken. Since it happened on both pairs, I presume it's a manufacture flaw."
1,Worked great until they broke,This was a great idea and a great design. Pity that the plastic end caps (which are essential to hold the metal jaws in place) were not up to the task. They broke after the third use. The end caps should be machined from aluminum.
3,Do you really need these?,"I got these thinking I could use them all the time, and so far they have just sat clipped next to all my other usefull clamps. They look like they could help me out, but so far I have either had a helper hold things, or used my regular Quick Clamps.Unless you know you will be building cabinets by yourself and need this kind of help lining up the parts I would pass on these, and get another set of pipe clamps, or Quick Grip clamps that are more universal."
3,A Journalist reports on what the crew of Apollo 11 will do when the reach the moon.,"Henry S.F. Cooper reports on what proceedures the Apollo 11 astronauts would be following when they landed on the moon. This was written BEFORE they landed and was intended to be a guide to what ""should"" happen when you watched men walk on the moon for the first time. It is very detailed, but suprisingly easy to read. Having chosen this book as my introduction to the Apollo flights, it prepared me for reading about other Apollo missions."
4,Good purchase,Very happy with this product. I also have several more complicated micro sprinkler set ups. I like this because it all comes together in one package. It's meant for one area only. You can't buy multiple sets and attach them. The water pressure works for what they have designed.
5,Great book for beginners!,I just recently started the art of beading (2 weeks ago). I had surfed the web to find out more about this craft and discovered Barbara Elbe's books. Amulet Obsession is the first bead book I have purchased & I am almosty finished with creating one of her designs. This is a great book for beginners. I had no trouble understanding her instructions (which are well written) and her graphs are easy to follow. This has been my first experinece with beading and it has been a great one. I plan to purchase Barabara's other books as well.
1,Lousy,"I love,and admire Vallejo's writting,but this book,is nothing but a bunch of nonsense.I have no clue what he was thinking,I am afraid he wasnt!!Love all his other books,but forget this one."
1,not so good,"not really what I expected a hard plastic board with a very nice beach picture on it is more like it, not flappy at all. it doesn't always stay in one place on the desk(it moves around a lot actually) I will probably end up purchasing something else."
4,At last!!,"I first saw this movie on Showtime back in the late Seventies or early Eighties, and tried to find it on tape for years afterwards. Very funny, and I LOVED seeing Ron Howard (uncredited) and Cindy Williams in the same film pre-Happy Days/Laverne & Shirley. I have frequently tried to describe this film to my friends, and been frustrated. Even singing ""Dancing Dildoes Are We"" didn't convey the hilarity. Now I can show them!! You should see it too.If you truly love the bizarre bellylaugh in film, run ""The First Nudie Musical"" as a double feature with ""The Forbidden Zone"" by Richard Elfman. You will laugh all night long."
2,"Moderately funny movie, TERRIBLE transfer","I seriously doubt that Rebecca saw this DVD - this transfer is so far from ""great"" it's not funny. I got MY screener yesterday and found both image and sound to be BADLY flawed. The video and audio quality are a total mess. However, the DVD does include a nice roster of extras. I haven't had a chance to check out any of them yet, so I can't directly discuss them, but Image clearly put a lot of effort into that side of things. Too bad the picture and sound are so horrible..."
2,Two stars might be generous,"Hmmm, I'm not quite sure which DVD most of you were watching, but I personally didn't think the transfer was all that amazing. The sound was ok at best and as I said earlier, the transfer was only ok, I've seen better.I expected the film to be funny and the music to be imaginative, but neither really made the grade. It's not nearly as funny as it could be, and if the DVD ever makes it to a 2nd pressing, you won't be missing much if you don't get the soundtrack. The extras are the DVD's saving grace."
1,Skip this one.,"This is a really bad production of the movie.There is no remastering, so the movie is grainy and blurry."
3,Simply unique!!,"The title sounded interesting so I thought it was worth a look and although not the best film I've ever seen, it was certainly one to see.Charming and well thought out movie that should remain a cult movie for the next 25 years too.The plot is basically a film in a film. We watch as a crazy team attempt to put on the world's first sex musical. The film is certainly more comedy than porn so don't be put off. Give it a try."
5,a piece of my childhood,"When I was a little girl, my elementary school library carried this book and I constantly checked it out. I loved the beautiful illustrations. This book and the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder greatly shaped my childhood and present outlook on life. Simplicity."
5,An Amazing Book great for the whole family,I gave this book to two separate families for a Christmas present.I was so excited to see it back in print. The story is about how the love of a father can overcome even hardship.
3,Best Of Wes Montgomery,The CD contained in the book upon arrival was not the original as published new. The book itself was ok. The material was rather bare bones and did not offer much beyond the little to no technical application of Wes' style. It is more for accomplished pros wanting to have sheet music for those songs as opposed to an in depth introduction and application to Wes Montgomery's style and his signature technique.
1,How to cheat others and influence weaker people.,"This book has few (if any) redeemable qualities. It is not much more then a cheap attempt at knocking off a rewrite of an all ready flawed book in an attempt to cash in on the current popularity of modern Witchcraft (Pagan or otherwise).When I received an advanced copy from the publisher last June, (so it was possible for the other reviewer to have read it before it came out....as I did.) I tried to approach the book with an open mind....however....the title is as misleading as the `words' inside.If some is looking for information about Modern Pagan Witchcraft they will not find it here....what they will find is ways to cheat hotels, get free air travel and other wise be a pain until someone gives you something.If that is your goal...by all means buy the book...however if you have a set of ethical standards higher then the slug (with apologies to any terrestrial, gastropd mollusks reading this) ...spend your money on something worth reading."
2,"Well, The Financial Advice Isn't Bad","My main interest in any Wiccan or Occult volume is its ideology, its link to the spiritual. I generally don't like books of spells that read like recipe books. But the Frosts go a step FURTHER....this book is much less about Wicca than it is advice on how to live life practically. Despite its seeming ""for beginners"" aura, this book kind of assumes the reader has already figured out how to channel his own supernatural powers so the Frosts can tell him what to do with them. Nowhere is there an explanation of where these powers might come from. This lends the book an air of complete unbelievability to the uninitiated--hardly the impression you'd want to make on someone just starting to discover their spiritual power. Nevertheless, to divorce oneself completely from the book's ideology, there are practical pearls of wisdom and insightful real-world meditations on saving and making money (mind you, there are also lots of silly meditations...)."
1,Don't Buy It,This book is full of stories of people that improved their lives with witchcraft but offers no explanations of how to do it yourself. It seems to be a way for the authors to self-promote their school. There is no reason to buy this book when there are so many truely helpful books about magick out there.
2,No so bad.,"I must admit I am only about half way through this book, but it does seem to be a while between drinks. I am in agreeance with other reviewers and find that this book is not really for the beginner, but it does have some interesting points. It is not the best book I have read on the subject but I am going to persevere anyway. Not really a book I would recommend for learning, but worth a look."
2,Boring and useless!,When I bought this book I was expecting just what the title said - the magic power - this book is boring and useless. The book isn't organised and gives hardly any information. The book does tell you how Witchcraft can help you in life but the book doesn't guide you. A total waste of time as the book is filled with rubbish and often repeats itself.
1,Absolutely Horrible!!,This is one of the worst books on witchcraft I have ever read. It is sloppily put together and contains an abundance of false information. There are much better books on witchcraft out there.
4,Perky,"This a perky entry in the otherwise gloomy occult or new age section at chain bookstores. You can't help but admire the authors, a happily married couple who run the Church and School of Wicca. The last book I read of their's it had the answers to all my problems- love, women ""reading"" playboy magazines, what the cut off line for poverty is, why I didn't get that job, etc. I found this in a mall I thought it was a revized version of The Magic Power of Witchcraft, but it is in fact a reissue of The Good Witches' Bible. BUT...a CHURCH...and SCHOOL...of WICCA? That's the problem right there holding it back even today's society's prejudices; rather than it be a hip and rebellious practice busy forming local covens in a desolte location in the woods, busing hexing and intimidating people, it entered the realm of kink and perkiness, the kind of wholesome kink and perkiness. I"
1,What the he*l is this stuff,"This is not Wicca becasue Wicca doesnt pormise that you will be able to control people through the use of "" Your Magickal White Witchcraft Powers"". Grow up Hermoine and Harry this is the real world. The only thing I liked about this book is that it had some Astral Projection. And do these poeple not teach that is something was going to posess your body it would be drawn back into it. Then how do they promise to teach you how to posess someone elses body. This is not reall Wicca or Witchcraft if you want real withcraft try: Wicca: A guide for the Solitary Practitioner or any of the Scott Cunninghams books. OR Raymond Bucklands books and my favorite one Silver Ravenwolf."
5,You Need This,"David Hooper delivers his 14 qualities of successful musicians in a way that is clear, concise and most importantly- extremely practical and eye-opening. The industry secrets he lays out almost make you feel like you're cheating the business or gaining years of experience in one fell swoop. I had never heard of David Hooper before coming across this but I will definitely be checking out his other products to see what else he has in store. Highly recommended."
5,A Helpful and Clear Approach to Reaching Your Goals......,"Having been involved in the Music Industry as an Artist, Composer and Producer for quite sometime now, I could easily say that ""I Have Heard It All."" However after giving David Hooper's 14 Qualities of Successful Musicians, Songwriters, and Music Business Professionals a listen, I was pleased to have witnessed a sincere approach from Mr. Hooper. There are far too few these days who offer up ""Aspiration for Your Inspiration."" Mr. Hoopers concise viewpoints should help anyone from losing sight of the goal while traveling on the path."
5,Just what we needed...,"Talk about lighting a fire under our asses! This cd has me really inspired. If you make $1 a month off of your music, or $1,000,000 a month off of your music, you can benefit from this product.http://www.DeadRebels.com"
5,A MUST READ!,"I own a small indie label in Madison, WI and I am always looking for ways to improve upon my business, my relationship with my artists and my standing in the community. 14 Qualities lays out the items that you need to focus on in order to be successful. This book is concise, well written and in my mind - a must reasd for anybody in the industry."
5,14 Friends,"We all get tons of emails and offers from people we don't know--about products we don't need. Once in a while, however, our skepticism gets erased by the genuine article: truly helpful information...the kind of information that usually comes only from close friends. This collection of tips from David Hooper about the music biz not only allows you to break thru your own limitations, it feels like your friend taking you by the hand and saying, ""Hey, you can do this man!"""
5,Qualities not Quantities,"At $39.95, that's less than $3 per ""Quality""! But it's not the quantity of the qualities that make this a steal, it's the quality. And David Hooper is all about quality. You might argue that much of this work is ""common sense,"" but the bold truth is that most of us are good at applying common sense to everyday situations, but we're very poor at applying common sense (and sticking to our plan) when it comes to our careers. This is not some new age self-help book that has you write affirmations on post-its and stick them to the mirror. This is the real deal, a quality piece of work that can make a difference in your career. If you want to take your career to the next level, invest in 14 Qualities. As I said, at less than $3/quality, can you really afford to wait?"
4,This CD is fabulous!,"This CD is WONDERFUL! I have worked directly with David at his Nashville New Music Conference and he is a wealth of knowledge, experience and success.He does a great job of sharing his concepts by presenting the information clearly, positively, and in an approachable format.The CD helped me to discover new avenues for furthering my career through great ideas like building a support team to help me to promote my music.It's worth it :)"
5,"arts, entertainment & media management masters graduate","I am an arts, entertainment & media management masters graduate from Columbia College Chicago. My focus was on performing arts management, but in reality I am doing a little of everything in this book from performing as an artist myself, to managing other individual artists, to working as an interim assistant director within a community music school. So all of the information is not your typical stuff learned in graduate school, but none the less important information that SHOULD be taught to up-n-coming musicians and manager hopefuls."
4,I enjoyed this!,"14 Qualities of Successful Musicians, Songwriters, and Music Business ProfessionalsI thought this was a good, solid presentation of 14 qualities that all musicians need. I am a pretty tough customer and I can't say that I disagree with any information the author provides. I would recommend this to the beginning musician as well as anyone interested in bettering themselves in the music industry."
5,DEVELOP THESE...,"David Hooper's fantastic audio CD will help those new to the music business avoid sooo many pitfalls and streamline their careers from the beginning. For those who have been in the business for awhile such as myself, the CD will remind you and help solidify some simple-yet-profound concepts...like being grateful (WOW! new concept) and delegating day to day tasks, even when it seems you can't afford the help. The 14 qualities David discusses are applicable to any industry pro, from producers to writers to bands; as an added bonus, developing the qualities (like fearlessness, risk-taking, charity) will help you be successful in life, not just music. Pop this CD into your discman or home stereo while you're making dinner, resting, working out, etc and let David's pointed, clear delivery share some valuable info and insight. This guy knows what he's talking about."
5,"No nonsense, no fluff.","This is the bare-bones and the bottom line presentation that needs to be heard by everyone who even remotely considers themselves to be ""in the music business"" today. It is a point by point reality check for musicians and managers, placing individual goals into a poignant perspective. The only caveat here is that after experiencing Dave Hooper's presentation, you will no longer have any excuses about your music career and the direction it's going!"
5,"14 Qualities of Successful Musicians, Songwriters, and Music","I am a new manager of a Hip Hop group and find the 14 Qualities of Successful Musicians, Songwriters, and Music Business Professionals CD by David Hooper is a must have for everyone in the music business. I find the CD to be very helpful in providing insight in taking risks, selling more CD's, making more money, etc. After listening to the CD I am more enthusiastic and confident about managing my group more successfully.THANKS MR. HOOPER FOR A JOB WELL DONE!"
3,Great info!,"The information David shares in 14 Qualities of Successful Musicians, Songwriters, and Music Business Professionals is very useful, especially for someone like me who has just started her own business working with musicians and music industry professionals. I plan to put into action many of the suggestions David as made and am excited to watch my business grow and succeed! LB"
3,It good enought to buy,"I bought it recently and found it worthy to keep in my library.It was a great buy along with a couple of manuals I purchased from Musicbrains.net entitled the Indie label Kit on Amazon, Music business 101, future of music and Guide to releasing an independent record by Tim Sweeney."
4,Great Value,"This clamp does everything I need it to do at a very comfortable price point. I am quite happy with the Columbian clamps that I have bought, all of them purchased through Amazon, and find them to be durable as well as easy to use.My only gripes with the Columbian brand clamps that I own are the rubber pads that cover the actual clamping portions are ALWAYS falling off. I would rate this clamp 6 stars if I didn't always have to bend down to pick up them up off the floor. I know, I could glue them on, but I am just being honest with the clamps as they arrive. (Good luck getting the sticker and all of the sticky residue off these as well.)Bottom line; these clamps offer an exceptional value. 4.5 stars"
2,Too Political and Full of Generalizations,"Contrary to the author's beliefs, not all women are scarred by sexism, and not all therapy has to be different for people of different genders. The books relies on political assumptions about the way the world works that many of us may disagree with, and makes generalizations about our experiences that are often innaccurate. I recommend that you read something where the author is not so clearly pushing her political agenda if you really want to be helped."
1,Broken during shipping,"The Melamine trays were poorly packaged and two out of four were broken in shipping. Otherwise, the quality of the product was satisfactory and we would have kept them if two of them were not broken."
4,Interesting approach,"I found the way she dealt with her situation admirable. However, something about the last 2 chapters derailed the book."
5,Why I wore lipstick to write this review,"Geralyn Lucas manages to share her experience, strength and hope about her breast cancer diagnosis in a bold and funny way. As a breast cancer survivor, I certainly could relate to her story. I only wish I had her drive (maybe it is because I really wear lip gloss). Geralyn's book is honest, open and true. She is an inspiration and best of all; a survivor. YOU GO GIRL!"
2,the perfect book,"Overall, this book is good. It's funny. It might be inspiring in parts. You could call it realistic and honest. I picked it up to read about 'what it means to be a young girl with cancer in a beauty-obsessed culture'. It's actually the story of what happens when the Perfect Life is tainted with cancer.There are too many references to that Perfect Life. The author is a name-dropper and talks about all the people she knows and how they contributed to her successful recovery. Barbara Walters sent her flowers. Everyone in the book that she encounters is helpful, supportive, complimentary (even when she's sick & bald from chemo), and lavish with their praise. She does the surgery, the treatment, and the recovery in her Perfect way. At times, it seems that she is more worried about losing her Perfect Husband & Dream Job than her health.This book might be good to give someone for a laugh or for support with cancer. But please warn them that it takes place in a Hollywood Perfect World."
2,Very surface,"Every young woman's experience with cancer is different so this account is useful from that perspective. But as a young survivor I found it very ego-centric and not at all relateable. Is it tragic that she got breast cancer - yes. Is it more tragic that she got breast cancer AND she's ""pretty"" and married to a doctor and knows people whose names we recognize - no. While I acknowledge that body image and issues of sexuality and attractiveness seem to be more acute the younger a woman is - this book never develops beyond the surface. Being someone that is not interested in ""It"" girls (or guys) to begin with - her ""it"" experience with breast cancer is also lack-luster for me."
1,Awful - Never buy from seller,I purchased the book with more than enough time to receive before my class started and then never received the book. I sent several emails and never got a response when following up to see why I did not get the book.Not reliable at all!!!!Forced me to scramble to get the book elsewhere and cram for my test at the last minute.
2,Tedious,"First of all, the claim that secularists should know the Bible is obvious. Then the notion that they don't take the Bible seriously enough depends on what is meant. They may indeed only take its threat seriously when they are forced to by the depredations of dangerous religious enthusiasts. Should they take it seriously at other times? Why? It is a marvelous collection of nonsense indeed.The author is correct in doubting that biblical scholars will ever convince believers that the Bible isn't what they think it is. For almost four hundred years now, since at least Spinoza, we know the Bible is not God's word or anything like that, but believers still insist on their fairy stories and especially on The Blue Fairy of desire.This book doesn't do me any good. I don't know if someone else will find it useful, I suspect not."
1,"Arrogant, Silly Book","There have been some excellent books recently on the subject of religion by the great evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, the brilliant philosopher Daniel Dennett, the writer/journalist Christopher Hitchens and Neuroscientist Sam Harris. This book is not in that class. The author arrogantly asserts that Non-believers MUST take religion seriously, without ever explaining why. Well, sorry. Religion is a vestige of humanity's primitive past which we would be much better without. If religion is allowed to hold sway, we may not make it out of the 21st century, as the religions nutcases will blow us all to smithereens. Furthermore, the author displays his bias when he says that he prefers that secularism always remain the minority view. Of course, this is likely, considering the preponderence of idiots on the planet, but we can hope that the mass of humanity can be enlightened through education."
2,Doesn't make any sense,"Why Nonbelievers Must Take Religion Seriously? Because, Berlinerblau claims:1) It is not clear who wrote the Bible2) It is not clear what the Bible means3) It is not clear whether the Bible is against Jewish intermarriage or not (in some parts it is clearly against it, but not in others)4) It is not clear whether the Bible is against homosexuals (it only says they should die!)Well, given the question, these answers don't make any sense to me."
2,Not so great,"The batteries don't last, the sound is very tinny and when the book only costs about $15 or so, and you spend $9 on 3 batteries every 2 weeks, it's just not worth it."
4,Roller coaster plot,"Stephen Frey writes financial thrillers. This is a sequel to his previous novel The Chairman.This one departs partly from the financial thriller category in that it is populated with spies,a clandestine goverment agency, and the emerging field of nannotechnology.Christian Gillette is beset with innumerable problems but he keeps his cool and cuts the Gordian knot to reveal the beast at the heart of the threats to him and his firm.I recommend it for a quick read."
2,Disappointed,"What a disappointment. Frey attempts to work in too many plot lines, his poorly developed characters have no substance other than to assure that they function best as whiny spoiled children. Adults who behave that way in the real world would be out the door of a firm like Everest. My only reason for even finishing the book was because I was on an airplane. Had I a selection of other books from which to choose (or could have found a passenger willing to trade), I would have set this book aside without temptation to learn the ending. I'm disappointed with all of the strings that Frey leaves dangling, clearly setting up the reader for another book in the series. I will not be purchasing that one."
2,Slow pace,"Not the best in the Stephen Frey production. The plot is a bore, you can not write three books with the material for one"
2,Same story different names...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Frey book, The Chairman. Different, well developed characters, multiple plot lines but not to the point of being distracting. For the same reasons I enjoyed the Chairman, I disliked the Protege. It was the equivalent of baking a cake that is identical to another one, give it a different color frosting and call it unique and different. The book follows the same approach and becomes boring very quickly. Save the $8 and buy something else."
4,Thank you (once again) Stephen Frey,"Another day on the beach in Maui, spent with Stephen Frey.Would recommend you read The Chairman first, it will add to your enjoyment of this book. They are both great reads! Good guys, really bad guys... smart bad guys (the best kind).. and a timely storyline. Money, power, corruption... oh my!!"
3,Too much of a good thing,"Do you like books about Mafia? How about Corporate spies? Mergers and billion dollar business deals? How about political influence? Like books about exotic places where people are murdered? Books about scientific inventions that can destory the world? Books about the CIA? Books about football teams? How about books about up from the boot straps African American men who make good on hard work and have private detective agencies?If you like all these things, you still won't like this book. There isn't a popular element of suspense fiction that the author HASN'T sqeezed into this book. And frankly, it's too much. The fact that this was the sequel to another book only made it more confusing. I read lots of sequels without reading the first book, and this one falls very short of the mark for entertainment or realism."
2,A bit unbelievable,The book is simply too extraordinary to believe. The superhuman ability of the lead character makes the story line too much like a Marvel comic. A disappointingly effort.
3,"madam ,everything is possible in India...","Although we found this guide book very helpful for trains, buses and places to go to, We've been to many places where the book only lists the big hotels and not the nice and cozy guest houses We've eventually found on our own. Many travelers that We've met on the road were looking for the same thing: nice guest houses and not big huge hotels.Also there are fast changes in India that Lonely planet should be informed about. We did for some of these changes but it was ignored. This new one did not have any of the changes we wrote to them about."
3,quality still not high,"As with all LP guides, success and industrial-style production have brought wealth to the owners but quality has suffered. This book doesn't have as many egregious errors as some previous editions, but it's still weak in many ways. Although sometimes it's delightful, like when the Great Value Hotel in Dehradun is praised for having a candle in each room ""for romantic lighting""!! (Anyone who has been to India knows what the candles are really there for---emergency lighting for when the power fails, which can happen daily.)"
4,Pretty Good,"I have used the Lonely Planet Guides before when living in China and they were a great help when traveling within the country. I will be going to India for a two week trip and will use this guide to help plan out sight seeing, restaurants, hotels etc. It is packed with good information on the culture, and safety and health issues. The information presented has been echoed in other sources I have read. It is worth the money. I am using it in conjunction with the Rough Guide to India."
4,Lonely Planet India,"More information than most people need. Maps are small and hard to read. Text is easier to read than the Rough Guide. Wish Lonely Planet would publish a guide to Northern India at a decent price. Most travelers only need the areas around Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra, and Varanasi."
3,Great for children,"The very low price on these is very attractive as well as the fact that one can make different sounds and not just the ""clap."" But they are small and perhaps best for children. I never use them and quickly went to the Toca Pro wood claves, which are awesome and give a much louder sound, using the palm as an (optional) sound chamber.Toca Pro Wood Claves (Standard)I was actually looking for something close to Aboriginal clapsticks. I learned that the vast majority of those that are on the market are too small and high pitched to compare, but the deep and full sound of the Toca Claves does the job just fine."
5,Perhaps the best economical deal in percussion!,"I like the varying tones of these very well--high quality wood and finish--resulting in great feel. Extraordinary value and multi-purpose. They make my RT Jam Block really come alive! Thanks, Amazon and West Music!"
5,Nothing bad to say,"I've had this product for a few weeks, and it's awesome. If you have an active baby who likes to make noise and put things in her mouth, this is great."
3,"Basic Beat Pair of 8"" Combination Rhythm Sticks","Haven't used it much, but it was cheap and the sound is nothing special. I don't know what it sounds like recorded, but for now it just seems so so. Can't complain for the price.."
5,My 2 year old LOVES these,Perfect for my young son who is currently obsessed with playing the drums. I chose these for the price and was pleasantly surprised. They are a nice size for small hands and I'm not concerned that he will injure himself with them as I would be with other drumsticks. They're also perfect for banging together :)
4,and interesting LIST of the essential considerations,i got this book out just to other day to give to a Book exchangeat Christmas but decided to keep it. Just the list of all theconcepts is enough to get a neophyte well on the way! Seriously.Buy a used copy and check it out!
1,Gibberish,The fundamental problem with this book is the fact that the author is in love with her own use of jargon. This obscures any message that she might be trying to put across. Try writing in English next time.
2,"No longer ""complete""","This book is feeling its age, and it is no longer ""complete."" It is ok for libraries that still use a card catalog since most of the lessons for the upper grades are based on it. I would recommend finding a different book if you are looking for lesson plans."
3,Outdated. Better options available.,"I have not found this book to be very helpful at all. It is outdated, and the lessons that are still applicable are things I figured out to teach (and how) on my own last year in my first year as a librarian (how to turn pages, how to put books back on shelf, etc.) ""Complete Library Skills"" by Linda Turrell is a much better option. (I have the older versions, purchased here, and the newer ones, purchased from a library supplies vendor, and I use them both.)"
3,difficult to follow,"This book was sort of difficult to follow. Although I understood the plot line and story, I got lost a couple of times in reading it. It was not the most captivating book that I have ever read and i would rank it a C+ or B-"
3,"Good Book, but not one of the ""Greatest""","This was a well written and entertaining book, but it didn't grasp me like some others I have read. I am a tad concerned about reading the sequel since other commentors have said it was not nearly as good as the original."
2,What a let-down,"I chose to read this book to appease all my friends who kept raving about it. I didn't make it the first time due to boredom - too much dragging, no flow. I finished it the second time, and I'm still not impressed. The characters are completely flat, serving as a pitiful frame for fleshing out an alien race. It reads like an episode of the original Star Trek with an overdose of social and technical jargon. I'll give it 2 stars only because the cover looked nice."
2,Very so-so,"There's a bunch of reviews already that explain why this is a so-so read... I'll just add my rating to knock down these 5-star, ""Greatest-book-ever"" reviews which are patently absurd. Maybe if you didn't read much of anything, you might think this book was wonderful, but even then I have a hard time believing it. Not sorry I read it- picked up for $1 at used store- but definately just a placeholder between the next good book..."
2,Boredom in God's Eye,This so-called classic was mostly boring but I stuck it out to the end. Are there any good books written by two people? Never read one.
2,Did not age well,"I read this book many, many years ago and was enthralled by it. Upon seeing it again on CD I ordered and listened to it. The story did not age well. The whole idea of an empire, ruled by a monarch and with entitled families just did not make sense. The ""space navy"" was anachronistic in the extreme in it's attitude to people, especially women . Sorry guys....."
3,Did not meet my expectations!,"""The Mote in God's Eye"" by Niven and Pournelle is a wonderful new world discovery and alien first encounter reading experience. I loved the storyline premise but I have to say, I couldn't wait for it to end. It's more a psychological study of the Motie's than it is a sci/fi adventure/thriller. The details of the relationship between the homosapiens and Motie's goes on and on ad nauseum. I had to force myself to finish this story. The chapters I liked, I loved, but it would have been a much better book IMHO if it was at least 200 pages shorter. I loved the storyline premise but I have to say, I couldn't wait for it to end. The chapters I liked, I loved, but it would have been a much better book IMHO if it was at least 200 pages shorter and had excluded all the psycho-babble...3 stars!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Humans discover the Moties, a very different race of aliens. Neither side is particularly honest with the other, and they are both quite martial.The Moties prove to be rather a handful, being genius savant types with technology, and gremlin or tribble like as far as being annoying goes.Interdiction seems the only option."
5,"Compelling, Well thought out SF...","SF writers don't write books like this anymore!!Most writers are trying to imitate the cyberpunksthese days. This book is grand, old-fashioned,compelling and obviously well thought out. TheAristocratic human empire is as well developedas the culture of the Moties. The characters arefleshed out and well drawn.The only other SF book that I can compare to thisto is Speaker For The Dead by Orson Scott Cardwhich also had an intriguing, well developed,alien culture.The only thing left to say is Read It! Enjoy it!"
3,Must read. Forgetting is optional.,"Kindle edition.Brilliant creation of a civilization so like our own, and so very, very alien. Humans, both the individual actors and the galactic politics, seem more difficult to believe in. Well, it's a classic, so everybody with a sci-fi heart should read it. Nice enough, but it's not a story that makes me longing for sequels."
5,The Epitome of Alien Contact stories,"Set out to be the Epitome of Alien Contact stories and succeeded. This is SF as it should be and anyone who isn't enthralled must be suffering from a seriously deficient imagination and sense of wonder. This book is very different to ""The Lord of the Rings"" but they have three things in common: (1) they restore faith in the survival of the story-teller's craft, (2) they are both long books, and, (3) the reader finishes them wishing they were a lot longer."
5,Excellent. Excellent. Excellent,"This has to be one of the finest Sci-Fi books ever written. Niven and Pournelle have woven a richly textured universe that explores mankind's future and the never ending quest to answer the ultimate question: Are we alone in the universe? Leave it Niven and Pournelle to conjure up an alien that is truly alien. No Klingons or Romulans here. The Moties are as bizarre as they are fascinating. One thing I like about Niven and Pournelle is that they let their own opinions and politics come out in their writing. For me it gives the characters a real quality, somehow more connected to the world we live in. This novel would make a spectacular movie. Why hasn't it been done yet?"
3,Mixed bag...,"The description of the Motie (aliens) civilization, their castes, how they thought and the unraveling of their 'big problem' made for really enjoyable reading. That part was really well written.This book's problem was its description of humans. They didn't act like any humans I know of. Through most of the story Rod and Sally seem to only have a friendship and then suddenly they decide to get married?And there were huge leaps in logic at the very end to figure out the Motie's secret... it just felt so contrived.This book had two different authors and it showed."
3,They've written better books,"When you read this, keep in mind that it was written in 1974. There are some really interesting ideas in here, but it took me at least 100 pages before it didn't feel like a chore to keep reading. The world in this book is very patriarchal, and there is only one female character who is not quite a stereotype, but she is basically a token smart chick. However it's not too unbelievable given that humankind in the story is still recovering - technologically and socially - from a crippling intergalactic war. The one issue I typically have with aliens in nearly every book is that they aren't alien enough. However Niven & Pournelle did set up some good ethical dilemmas and other problems which could be very gripping at times. Characters had depth and feeling as well. Overall, it was pretty decent, but they've written better books."
2,didn't work for me,"I am a fan of Larry Niven's work, but I did not like this book or it's sequel. I found the idea of a human future with a feudal system of hereditary royalty an annoying distraction. The characters felt flat and I did not get involved in the plot at all. It does have interesting concepts, which are the hallmark of Niven's writing, but I found the story line uninteresting. Niven's other collaborations, such as Lucifer's Hammer and Oath of Fealty, had more compelling characters and drama."
2,Can't compel myself to turn another page,Just couldn't keep going (which is rare for me). I got about 80% through and just didn't care what happened anymore.
1,Just plain silly,"I used to read Jerry Pournelle's computer column (in Byte magazine I think). That was a great column 15 years ago, he showed a very human side you didn't get from many other computer pieces. The column was long and winding, intermixing life and whatever computer toy he was playing with.So, recognizing his name I picked up this book. What a mistake. I'm sure there's a market for this branch of sci-fi, but it isn't me. This is space opera at it's worst, pure silliness. What Heinlein saw in this to give the endorsement on the cover of the edition I read, I'll never know."
3,100 Words or Less,"After 30 years, my memories of this novel were a few powerful scenes and general feeling of greatness. So, I decided to read it again. Can't go wrong with a sci-fi classic, can you?In this case ... maybe. Overall, it's an interesting look at first contact. The alien species is fun and different and challenging. The plot whips along. And the characters ...Well, this is where it falls short. The characters are a bit sexist, a bit thinly drawn, and frankly way too 1970s. Oh, the novel is still enjoyable. Just not as great as I once believed."
5,"Enjoyable classic, but flawed Proof reading on Kindle edition","I have this in hardback and enjoyed the greater portability. But the Kindle edition needs to be proof read again before being sold.Several typo - errors; ""he"" instead of ""be"" but most annoying is the repeated use of the number 1 in place of capital ""I"". Since I have read this book before, this is very noticeable, and annoying.Still, and all, this book is a classic for a reason and should be part of any Science Fiction fans collection."
2,Badly Stereotypical Dated Space Opera,"This was supposed to be one of those classics that never go out of style. What a laugh. With the extreme lack of any good characterization, the entire novel rests upon the storyline. The storyline is an unimpressive first contact with aliens. Unimpressive, again, because of 35 years of scientific advancement since the novel was written in 1974.So we have one-dimensional boring cliched characters (even an engineer with a Scottish accent, no Star Trek ripoff there, right?) on top of an unrealistic future society in a stereotypical first contact scenario. I can't understand why this book is good."
3,Evolution gone Insane!,"The premise of this novel is that intelligent life is rare, and second, that Faster than Light travel has its limitations. Written before the existence of Wormholes as a scientific theory, its Alderson drive concept hints at this phenomenon.I did not like the idea that a technological type 3 civilization can be achieved in a mere millenium nor that it is compatible with a pseudo feudal imperial form of government. Starships and Medievalism has been attempted a lot in Sci fi.The Moties are a biological nightmare. Once a stable bilaterally oriented species, it has become a myriad of mutated strains, castes, and classes created by wars and a million years of assigned work roles.You have to really bend your imagination a lot with this one, but it is fun reading."
2,"Interesting idea, mediocre execution","I like quite a bit of Pournelle's and Niven's other work, and this has an interesting concept, but it definitely drags. In addition, it has some irritating peculiarities with point of view, switching from character to character with little or no warning. The ""big reveal"" of the mystery is uninteresting, and the ending is unsatisfying. Heinlein's famous comment that this might be the best science fiction book he'd ever read is baffling; in my opinion, it's not even the best book that these two authors have written. Disappointing."
3,Typical Niven,"I wasn't real impressed with this book. Half-way through it, I would have rated it 2 of 5 stars, but it picked up at the end and I felt compelled to grant 3 of 5.It was difficult to feel for any of the characters. The plot seemed to be a bit jumpy, spending either too little or too much time on any one event. There were many lost opportunities for the authors to make the book more interesting, and to develop sub-plots. Finally, this book was disappointing due to the lack of sufficient mystery."
5,Niven and Pournelle's `Mote in God's Eye',"This, along with their earlier collaboration ``Lucifer's Hammer'' and later ``Footfall,'' is among Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's finest work. Set in Pournelle's future history, is a tale that is richly woven with interesting and compelling characters. Those characters are put together in a collision course with history as humankind coming out of the shattered wreck of the First Empire of Man and centuries of the Secession Wars has its first encounter with an alien race. Mankind finds out that race's deep and dark secret after its expedition is overrun. Without giving too much away, I simply encourage readers to either buy or check out this book and if you give it some time, I promise you that you won't be disappointed at this science fiction classic and masterpiece."
2,What happened,"This is a slow moving book that will test your resolve to keep reading it. Any action was few and far in between the tedious reading. Humans meeting a new species, the Moties, for the first time has a lot of exciting potential. However with the exception of those critters that could reengineer practically anything, kind of reminded me of replicators from SG1, the story line bogged down. The ending was also totally uninspiring. I know this is a classic just not sure why."
2,Mote in Gods Eye,"Where do I begin? This book had real potential...alas, it falls utterly flat. Lack of any character development WHATSOEVER along with a truly dated feel (the ""pocket computers"" that everyone carries around with them use circuit boards...this is a thousand years in the future, everyone should be walking around with quantum computers implanted in their teeth or something). My favorite character (Renner) is supposed to come off as some pompous arse, but is instead interpreted to be a knowledgeable patriot. Dr. Horvath is totally unrealistic...a scientist that is totally unwilling to change his beliefs even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. And the big Motie secret? BORING.I felt obligated rather than compelled to read this book, it was almost a chore."
2,Flawed and disappointing,"Fans of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle should take a pass on this book.Many of the story's elements were impressive. Some of the book's chapters might have made good short stories, and a few of the characters were credible and interesting. Perhaps this accounts for the praise this book has received.As a whole, however, the book is unfocussed, dragging on endlessly before reaching its disappointing conclusion.The sequel to this book, The Gripping Hand, is also worth avoiding."
2,not really convincing,"This book was at times quite interesting to read and there are some intriguing ideas, but somehow it can't really convince. As for being called a hard science book - how can an author describe a ferret as a catsized RODENT?? Jeeeeeez, that's like saying that an elefant is a primate. Another blunder is the space suit - it's described as being very thin and using body heat for thermoregulation and the best - it is permeable for perspiration!!! Helloooo? Doesn't anybody find that stupid? It should be called ""crazy loonies certain death suit"" ;-) was this a lousy attempt to ""copy"" Frank Herberts stillsuit? I don't know but, I know that it's not hard science."
1,Incredibly Disappointing,"I rarely rate books here, but I have to leave my two cents on this one. Don't waste your time, this is a horrible book. For every good stretch that is interesting - which are few - there are long vast complicated stretches of either confusion or boredom.The complexity of the Motie species doesn't work well for the story. I love hard science fiction, but this is hard sci fi done wrong. Plus you have the stereotypical characters as many have mentioned. It is in many ways like reading a bad Star Trek episode.Worst is the self-approval stamp Heinlen put on this work. As one reviewer mentioned, he only allowed it if he could edit and fix the final manuscript himself, thus saying how great his own work is - shameless.When I finished this book, it went straight to the trash. For so much potential, it fails so miserably."
2,"Laughing At It, Not With It. Boring, Wooden, Unrewarding.","He's no Asimov and this is definitely not a classic of the genre. This book has dated badly. I don't imagine there will be any ""Special 30th Anniversary Edition"" coming out.I had the misfortune to be stuck with it on a trip through California after I stole it from the Turtle Hill Youth Hostel in SF so I'd have something to read. Boy did I ever get the punishment I deserved. Corny characters, bad science inventions, and a really unenlightened cold-war, paranoid ethic.One problem is that I've been reading Iain Banks' Sci-Fi lately and that has set the bar pretty high for what's good or not."
4,Some of the most believable. . .,". . .alien life-forms ever presented in a science fiction format.Normally, sci-fi novels excel in one of a number of areas. Either the science is good, or the plot is exciting, or significant issues are discussed, or the characters are well-developed -- but rarely are more than one or two of these elements ever found within the pages of the same book.""The Mote in God's Eye"" is a spectacular exception to this trend. It is a believable ""First Contact"" story with a reasonable ""history"". The characters are deep and well-developed. Serious moral and ethical issues are fearlessly tackled. The plot is exciting -- and the science is plausible. However, perhaps the most noteworthy point of this book is that the ""alien life"" presented is both truly alien and believable.This is a book not to be missed."
1,Hasn't eaten its Wheaties,"Frankly disappointed. Had a Black and Decker stick cordless, accidentally left in Biloxi while helping with hurricane cleanup. Bought this. Got one battery instead of two as advertised. Battery life is poor, and the tool is pretty wimpy, especially to wear the Milwaukee name. I love my other Milwaukee tools, but this one is not worthy of the title. Will barely drive a 1 1/4"" sheetrock screw."
3,There are better child DVDs,Looks like it was recorded from an old and dated VHS version. I bought several products for the grandkids and found the following to hold their interest a lot better (Read and Share series):http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_14?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords;=read+and+share+dvd+bible&sprefix;=read+and+share&ih;=13_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1.93_570&fsc;=6
1,waste of paper,"It doesn't even deserve one star. Not much here about paper engineering. The paper is cheesy, color reproduction is terrible, photographs uninteresting, with few exceptions. Almost all promotional material. I didn't even bother to read what little text there is. I have some wonderful books on paper engineering and will not insult them by including this in my library. It goes back tomorrow.Save your money."
5,Great Candle!,I work in a Veterinary Hospital - so we get all kinds of smells :/ But this candle actually covered them all! Clients would say how great it smelled when they walked in. An amazing product & a steal at the price
5,Fit its purpose,I purchased this air filter for my car. It was a perfect fit and easy to install. The cost was affordable too.
2,Not Very Interesting,This is a memoir by someone too young to have made sense of his own life yet. The author is still at an age where he believes that experiences which are common to many people are unique to himself.He should publish a second edition in 20 years or so when he has more perspective on himself and the world.
3,Two-pronged story,"This book tells two stories--one of a young black man who was raised in the tough Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn and who became an accomplished computer hacker and then computer security expert for a New York company, and the other is the technical details of how he carried out his computer hacking. I was very interested in this young man's personal story, but the technical parts were beyond my comprehension and I found myself skipping several chapters and parts of chapters. If you are computer savvy, this book may be something you will really enjoy, but if not you may only enjoy the personal side of it, as I did."
3,Interesting read but more about martial arts and personal development than about computers and hackers.,A decent read but the author labors over his martial arts experience than computers and hacking. Worth reading but not as substantive as 'The Cuckoo's Egg' by Clifford Stoll.
3,Not too bad,"The beginning of the book is a bit boring. If you love reading biography of ""a person"", it's probably a good time killer. If you are looking for something exciting underground, keep looking, this book is not suitable."
2,Fun to remember but no substance,"Hacker Cracker. Just the name caught my eye and so I bought it thinking it would be a similar to Masters of Deception or Mitnick story, but it wasn't. The entire book is just Mr. Nuwere recounting his exploits from America Online to large corporations, throwing in a good bit about the mean streets of New York, and rounding out (literally) with some non-relevant martial arts. After reading it I was really let down. I was looking for something a little more definitive about computer security, the evolution of it from the time he was a kid to now, etc. Sad to say Masters of Deception was a better book than this but nothing will ever come close to the writing talent, intrigue, and plain storytelling than Cliff Stoll's book the Cuckoo's Egg. Maybe in twenty years if Mr. Nuwere wrote another book and explained what he's learned after spending some time OUT of the mean streets then perhaps it'd be a better book. Right now it's just a feel good made for TV movie."
5,D-handle / hammer,This is a great Hammer Drill I too wish it had a reverse switch. Does anyone know if the housing from one of the other milwaukee D-Handle Drills with reverse would be interchangeablewith this Hammmer/Drill?
3,Why?,The tool can get the job done but the lack of reverse really happens the overall effectiveness of this tool.
1,Not worth it!,1991 caprice wagon- does not line up correctly. Does not sit flush against head light. Scratches way easily. One flew off on the highway at 60mph the same day it was installed.
3,Bluray misses nothing in Missing in Action 2,"The bluray edition has very good video & audio quality. I can't say the video is outstanding, but certainly looks GREAT for an old 1980's film. I don't know if it was remastered or not. Of the three new Chuck Norris bluray releases, I'd say Missing in Action (the first one), has the best image quality. The opening scene, with the camera moving through the jungle, prepares you for how good the film is going to look. Overall, I'm very pleased. There aren't any extras, unfortunately. The video quality of The Delta Force is good, but colors appear to be a tad oversaturated. I was worried about how much effort a Walmart-produced trasnfer would look, but ultimately it does not disappoint. If you're a fan, you can't go wrong to purchase the bluray, which is a steal at under $10."
1,no widescreen,i gave this one star because i can not believe the movie is not in the widescreen format. i do not like fullscreen.
3,Interesting subject matter; Goofy host,"The host seems intelligent enough, but he seems to think that his constant patter of silly humor makes the content more appealing. It doesn't. I think he could be a good host and guide, however, he needs to tone it down and remember that the content he is presenting is more important than his charming, fun-filled personality. As my wife said, ""The subject matter was good, but he needs to stop bouncing off the walls."""
3,"Good general performance, but lots of ""paper jams""","We have about 6 LaserJet 4050 printers and we are generally happy with them; however, there is a serious problem with the print feed rollers on these machines. We find that users complain of paper jams after a few thousand prints. It is always the case that the paper has not actually jammed, but is sitting on the hold down brackets because the lower pf roller has warn and can't pick it up. Replacing the pf rollers resolves the issue, but is a constant problem (pf roller run around $4.00 each)."
2,Boring & too predictable,"I bought the book with much anticipation and was abit disappointed by the plot. However, due to the other great books by Nora Roberts, I kept reading, hoping something exciting would happen on the next page.... But alas, not to happen."
4,"The first story was good, the second wasn't",I thought that Daniel and Anna's story was great. I really enjoyed going back to when women weren't allowed to do anything and how Anna showed them wrong. I was a bit confused on the second story because I thought that Daniel was a full-blooded Scot. Did his ancestors move back to Ireland? Confusing and a little too short to bring out the characters. The Alan and Serena stories were my favorite and I enjoyed hearing about Daniel's grandchildren.
2,"Boring, boilerplate material","This was not even close to the quality of the other (more modern-day) MacGregor books. Maybe if you're a fan of those ""historical"" romance novels, you'd like it, but if you like realistic, modern day love stories skip these. It was almost impossible to go back and picture Daniel as a young man. I'd rather think of him as the meddling, fiercely loyal parent and grandparent he became."
2,A very disappointing story.,"This was my first Nora Roberts book. After hearing and reading so many rave reviews of her other books this seemed a fitting start. I was beginning to wonder what all the fuss was about and decided to forget about this author, when I looked up what others thought about this book. It was encouraging to see that others agree with me, that this is a very boring story. I disliked these characters. I really did not care what happened to them. For someone as smart as Anna was supposed to be, she seemed incredibly stupid. I absolutely hated that Anna insisted on living with Daniel before she would consider marriage. This really goes against my moral values. I hear her other books in this series are better so I will find out. But, be warned this is not the impressive stuff I had anticipated at all."
1,"So awful - unfortunately, not typical Nora Roberts' quality.","I have read every Nora Roberts book out there (all I usually need is to see her name, and I buy it, no questions asked), and never written a review. But this book was SO BAD, I had to warn you all. The characters are boring (and not very likeable), the dialog is boring, the story is useless..."
2,This book was the pits!!!!!!!,Daniel-Ian was a very boring book. I was disappointed in it because it lacked the spark of her others. Ian's story was definitely boring: It took me forever to drag myself through it. I hope to like Serena-Caine better!!!!!.
4,Loved it as usual!!!,"I loved this one sas I do all the rest. I would love to see the family completed (Matt, Ameila, and Adria)!!!!!! Can't wait for the next Nora Roberts. Especially if its a McGreagor!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Its the love for family that pulls me in...,"The MacGregors are a wonderful family that you wish were yours, a little on the too perfect side but quite lovable. Daniel MacGregor is a person I would love to be able to meet, and I am looking forward to reading the history of the family and am hoping that Nora Roberts marries off the whole family, because if their going to be perfect, well....let's do it right. Smile"
2,"For now, Forever: MacGregors",I bought this book because I love sagas but if the rest of them have as much filler in them as this one I have no interest in reading the others. As I was reading the book I found myself flipping through over halft of the pages and not even reading them. Do not reccomend this book.
5,MacGregors,Loved seeing where it all began with the MacGregor and Anna! Ift was fun to see how they got started out after seeing them so settled in all the other books.
2,broke fast and would not stay together,Used on a couple trips but the pieces do not stick together for long and a small fish ended up cracking the rod in half at the base. They are good for a trip or two but its not going to last like most ugly sticks.
3,Strange Construction?,"Overall this is a good rod for the intended purpose. Slightly on the stiff side, probably because of the 4 piece construction. The weird thing was, the factory installed hook holder would not let the handle section and first piece go together fully. I removed the hook holder and did a little trimming. Works fine now."
5,Simply Great Toys,"My son loves all of the Thomas toys, we started his set a year ago and have kept building on to it. He still plays with his engines almost everyday. Great toys that really last and are worth the extra you pay. We recently bought a Tomica brand Thomas toy and I ended up returning it that night (something I have never done) as I was so dissapointed in the quality."
2,Surprisingly unhelpful,"I gave it 2 stars because the content - all 1,000+ pages of it - doesn't match the title. It should be called ""Web Programming - The Complete Overview.""If you want to learn to use Dreamweaver specifically, look elsewhere. Of a thousand pages, exactly FOUR are dedicated to creating a form within Dreamweaver, two to creating a site map. There are whole chapters on ASP, Coldfusion, JSP, PHP, SQL, server authentication - notice that none of those topics are Dreamweaver-specific and all of them could easily be found in books specific to those topics.I hate it when programmers try to write for end-users. The content usually wanders woefully off-topic as they pursue what interests themselves rather than their readers. If you want a book for using Dreamweaver, this isn't it. If you want an overview and concepts about various types of web programming, you might like this."
1,It doesn't talk much about with Dreamweaver,"1. It tries to cover everything from web design, web programming and database programming. The reason I bought this book was to find the way Dreamweaver MX deals with those, not how to program, how to design database. It doesn't talk about Dreamweaver MX too much, so why do they use the title?2. This book has many flows, if you follow the code in the book, you get nowhere.If you just want to know the concept of web design, this book might be OK, but that's not something with Dreamweaver MX. If you want to find information on how to ease web development using Dreamweaver way, you will be disappointed."
3,Not bad,"I guess the book is good for someone who doesn't have any idea about anything regarding script languages and databaseI believe all the talking about the different script languages and SQl should have been in an appendix not as regular chaptersI really didn't buy the book to bother myself with ASP, HTML....which I already know. I bought the book to learn about DWMX.Some contents overlap with one another,too.No examples whatsoever.Wrox just published Beg DWMX this month.I guess I am gonna go buy it"
1,Misleading only BEGINS to describe this set.....,"Firstly, David Tennant and Matt Smith don't really work as 'keywords' for this 1/4 of a set. There are only FOUR episodes here. Amazon has the entire first series for just a few dollars more than this four episode set. $48 new and $36 used.This is from the 2005 revival starring Christopher Eccleston. It originally sold for $19.99 in stores. I recently purchased this same DVD for less than $10 right here on Amazon.Four good episodes, but not worth the inflated price."
3,Major Golf Tournaments,"I have several DVDs of Major golf tournaments and compared to the others I have, this one fails to measure up."
4,modern antique,I like sounds like roots and 2 or 3 songs of dub is good opcion for listen diferent reggae.
3,Realistic replica; not durable for rough kids,"My son is obsessed with garbage trucks (even going so far as to collect small LEGO pieces and other items to use as 'garbage' for it), and this is a good-looking one! Very realistic replica of the real thing, with a attention to details such as the tiny hydraulic cables that are laid out on top. It is perhaps a little smaller than I expected though.Unfortunately, it is not that well built. After only one week of typical kids play, several pieces have been crushed: the rearview mirrors, the gas tanks under the cabin, and even one of the hinges for the hood.As such, it is maybe more of an decorative ornament than a kids toy."
1,It is definitely not a toy to play with,I' m very disappointed by this truck. Too expensive for the quality. This truck is too fragile.This is definitively not a toy to play with: each peace of this truck can be broken very easily even if you really pay attention.I do not recommand this truck for a child as a gift.
1,I wish I could give it zero stars,It didn't fit the camera. It was useless. I gave up and got another (Canon) camera. Probably what I should have done to start. This one uses double A batteries and so I am no longer at the mercy of proprietary batteries.
2,My LCD DIED too!!!!!!,You can't even change an ink cartridge without the LCD screen!!!All I get when I turn on the printer is the BIG FAT red error light!!! Just in time to not be able to print the Christmas cards... Don't think I'll be buying another Epson.
1,LCD panel died for second time,"I have purchased many Epson products over the years, and recommended them to others,however that will never happen again. The first RX600 screen died within the first few months.Epson replaced the product with a refurbished model, however the screen just died on this one, about one year after replacement. So,naturally, when I called Epson, they said my warranty was out and I would have to take it to a service center to be repaired. I asked the support person at Epson if this was a common problem and he said, ""Not that I know of"". His only suggestion at first was to plug the unit into another electrical outlet, because it may not be getting enough power. Where is Epson getting these people? I had already told him the unit powered up, just the LCD screen wasn't working. I am frequently asked for recommendation on technical products by business associates and office managers for large business concerns. I will definitely steer them away from Epson in the future."
2,"LCD Failed 2x, too bad, rest of it's great","My first LCD display failed after 6 months. Second one just failed again, 2 months out of original warranty. Going to call and see if they'll replace or upgrade and I'll pay cost difference to newer model.It's sad that the LCD is such a piece of crap. The rest of the thing runs extremely well, perfect printouts, scans very well, etc. I'd be raving if the LCD wasn't so bad."
2,RX600 is a disappointment - bad LCD,"I bought my RX600 in June of 2004. About a month ago the LCD screen went blank rendering some of its functions near useless.This unit is used as a light office printer (not used heavily). While its photo scanning and printing functions are very good, the fact that a necessary feature such as the LCD is prone to so many failures (Google ""Epson RX600 LCD"" and see!) lends this printer unacceptable.I contacted Epson soon after the problem occurred and was told to send it to a repair center 2 states away or to return it to Epson for a discount on a new printer. I don't think so."
2,and another dead LCD,"decent printer, nice for photos. Dead LCD means screen accessible functions lost. I guess i'll have to wrangle with EPSON customer service to get a replacement. Based on previous reviews, I might be sending that back after a few months as well. Perhaps its time to consider an HP."
1,poor quality,"I had this printer for 14 months now. After 7 months, the LCD screen failed, making many of the functions unavailable.At that time, Epson replaced it under the warranty.But 7 months later the LCD screen failed again -- just after the warranty expired!It is a poorly built product."
2,"Nice printer, but not really Mac-compatible","I have this printer and while the output is good, Epson has yet to release an application for Intel-based Macs to take full advantage of the scanning capabilities. For the time being, I have to use ""full auto mode"" when scanning and hope that the scanner correctly guesses the type of documents and crops to the selection. If I try to take more control over the scanning process, the scanner simply does not work. Very annoying, and I haven't received any help from Epson with this issue."
3,Printing Envelopes,"This printer is TERRIBLE if you want to use it to create nicely printed return addresses on envelopes. After several converstations with customer service (at my expense), as well as a new piece of equipment sent to me, they could still not get the printer to print without spraying ink all over the folds of the envelopes."
1,No Fax equals NOT all-in-one ..... heartily agree,"I will have to agree with the misleading terminology of ""all-in-one"". The first ""all-in-one's"" were by HP and included the fax function; hence, the term all-in-one. To provide less is false and misleading.I am currently looking for a replacement for my HP all-in-one as the interface software SUCKS. HP does NOT know how to write good printer drivers/interfaces ..... yet they are the leader (for the most part) of the printer business.Epson is good, great ...... but this printer is VERY misleading, as are any that use the all-in-one terminology without including a fax as part of it ........ I know, I was being mis-lead and will now have to re-think my selection of printers.By the way ....... WHO on earth would every have a separate fax machine in addition to these ""all-in-one's""??? Does everyone have an abundance of space?"
1,Yet another LCD screen failure...Class Action Suit anyone????,Just out of warranty and my screen dies too. Epson customer service cannot help so I am up a creek without a printer. Has anyone considered a class action action suit since this is obviously a well known problem?
1,Epscon RX600 Don't buy!,"My Epson RX600 LCD went bad within the warranty, Epson replaced it. It went bad AGAIN within the warranty so I requested a different model - EPSON refused and sent me my third RX600. The LCD went bad at 14 months so I am out of luck. DON'T BUY EPSON."
1,Bad LCD - Worse Customer Service,The LCD went out on this printer just after the one-year warranty. Epson won't acknowledge the problem although there are complaints posted all over the Internet. I spoke to an Epson repair shop and they said that they had just returned from training and Epson had spoken to them about it--but won't acknowledge that it is a widespread problem and won't recall the printers to fix the faulty display. The LCD is ~$180 and they are not even offering a reduction on its cost. Stay away from this printer! Stay away from Epson!
1,LCD Display died after 16 months rendering printer useless,"Just like a lot of other people, we bought the Epson thinking it would last a good few years with occasional use. Well, just like others here, the LCD display has died after owning the printer for just under a year and a half.The problem is that without the LCD display, it appears to be impossible to replace the ink cartridges as you have to navigate through the printer display to tell it that new cartridges are installed. So, without the display, the printer is useless.Of course, it's out of warranty by three months, so Epson are not interested in fixing. A very disappointing printer, which was never up to a lot when it was working. Now it goes in a landfill along with all the other made in china electronics that last less than two years."
1,Epson Stylus Photo RX600 LCD Failure,"Like so many others, I have experienced LCD failure after warranty expiration of my Epson Stylus Photo RX600 Inkjet All-in-one. Seems like EPSON may have included a timer for these units to fail. Don't purchase EPSON!!!!"
2,WAS Great...but LCD screen went blank after only 3 months,"All the good things folks have said here are true...but so is the fact the the LCD screen is flaky. I purchased my RX600 in December '04 from Amazon. Was pleased with print quality, scanning abilities, and all around package. However, in March '05, a scant three months after purchase, the LCD screeen went blank.After doing a Web search, I've found that a number of folks have had this problem. There does not appear to be a fix, except to send the entire printer back to Epson, so that it can be replaced by a refurbished unit. A disappointing end to a great start."
1,Another owner with a dead LCD,"Printer produces nice pics, but LCD went black after 6 months. Epsoc CS sent a replacement RX620 (newer unit). DOA. Nice quality control, guys. May want to look at an HP even though they don't have separate ink carts."
1,Don't Buy Epson,"I bought this printer about 2 years ago, worked great, was very pleased with all features. Unfortunately the LCD stopped working after 18 months and now its virtually unusable. This was the first time I had bought Epson, and never again. Too many alternative out there to risk wasting hard earned cash on poor quality product with manufacturer who doesn't care for customers."
1,"Bad product, worse company","Any search of the RX600 and the words ""blank lcd"" or ""screen"" will show you that the lcd failure is a common problem with this unit. It is very difficult to use without the lcd. Search will also show that Epson is choosing to ignore this. Buy the RX600 at your own risk because you're on your own once you open the box. My first and last Epson product."
1,RX600 and Epson very disappointing,"We bought our RX600 3-4 years ago. Prints great photos. Scans successfully. Was never able to scan slides. All kinds of problems dating back to brand new. Ink is outrageously expensive and it consumes tons of ink. I have had to periodically unplug the RX600 to reset it to where it would boot up. Yesterday, it froze. Had to unplug again. This time, it's completely dead. Will not power up. Followed the Epson on-line troubleshooting, which led me to a 562 area code number (no toll free number???). That led me to customer service - IN INDIA!!! You get someone with a script in front of them who knows nothing about the product. I will ditch this RX600 and go back to a name I trust - HP. I have an HP LaserJet 4P, new in 1992, still runs like a champ. Printer cartridges are $100 about every 6-8 months. Wonderful printer. The RX600 has been a terrible disappointment."
4,Epson RS 600 LCD gone bad,I've owned my Epson RS 600 printer for a year and a half. The LCD went out and it will cost $200 to $300 to fix it while a newer model is on sale for $150. Epson customer support was of no help to me. All they would say was that the guarantee was upand I should go to a service center. The service center was so familiar with the problem that they recommended that I throw the printer away and buy another manufacturer's printer.
1,"Yes, dead lcd","An alright printer till the control panel LCD died. All the same, can't seem to find a decent machine from anywhere. HP, Canon, Epson, they're all the same. Really bad printers."
1,Do not buy RX600 - LCD screen went blank after 13 months.,The LCD screen on my Epxon RX600 went bad this week. Machine is just 13 months old! This has happened to a lot of people. My machine was just for home use. Seach on-line to see just how many other people who have had same thing happen. Epson does NOT stand behind their product!
