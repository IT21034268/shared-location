5,I love this series!!,I am a G1 purest. I hated the BayFormers. This is the best Transformers next to G1. The story line is great and it keeps you on your toes. If you have not seen it yet you will NOT be disappointed. PLUS NO FLAMES ON PRIME!!!
5,Transformers Prime,"I stumbled across TF:Prime while watching a new channel one day and thought ""what the heck. Why not"" I am a HUGE fan of the original series (G1) and grew up watching the Autobots and Decepticons wage their war across my TV, comics, and living room floor. I was not too sure I would like the animation style of the series based off the commercials I saw... but then I watched the pilot episode and was hooked! The stories are great! The characters are well done and entertaining. The whole series keeps the feel of the originals while creating a fresh start for a new generation of fans. I would like to see more Autobots arrive to balance out the growing number of Decepticons, but the underdog feel is good and lends a more heroic quality to the characters.I would give the series a 10 out of 10 for season one. I loved the season finale and am eagerly awaiting the start of season 2!"
2,What happened to the price???,"I agree with previous reviewers--this edition has become far too expensive. A few years ago I was THRILLED to discover such a fabulous text, lighter than the Riverside (I ruined my knees carrying that thing around as an undergrad), for only 40 dollars. It became my standard teaching text. And now suddenly it's up to sixty-two? Houghton Mifflin has obviously been taking some lessons from Harry Bailey."
2,Guardian Alert 911 Phone,"The first one I received didnt work at all. There was a short in the base units wiring causing intermiten powering.. which could be very dangerous thinking it was on and operable and in fact it wasn""t. After calling the Logitech Support, they responded quickly and mailed out a new unit and provided postage to return the faulty product. The unit seemed to be ok if its used within the home, but really didnt function much outside of the front or back porch.. My mom gardens frequently, just about 20 ft from the back door to the small garden in the yard and the unit DID NOT TRANSMIT that far.. so i was a little disappointed in telling my 87 year old mother to try to make it to the house if you need help!"
3,Cumbersome,Purchased for my mother. It is very easy to operate but too large to wear arround the neck.
3,Coffee maker works fine but was certainly beat up when it arrived.,"I dislike that this coffee maker ""looked"" used....a bit beat up. Sure it works fine but it's not so fine to look at."
2,"Good idea, but a bear to clean","I bought a factory reconditioned Grind and Brew a few years ago, and ignored a review I read somewhere that it is difficult to clean. I shouldn't have. Cleaning it is really a pain in the neck. Besides all the nooks and crannies where the grinds accumulate, the grinder needs cleaning after each use, as steam from the brewing makes a sticky mess of the grinder. Furthermore, be aware that the cup capacity is based on 6 oz. or smaller, and the coffee measurements they recommend produce a very weak brew. If you like a rich brew, the grinder might not have the capacity needed to make a full pot. I still use the thing, but wouldn't buy it again."
2,HELP WITH MY CUISINART DGB-600 Griner basket,"Sigh, I have had many of these problems myself & have managed to compromise. The filter door, no matter how secure it is and even after hearing the 'click', mid brew, usually while I am in the shower, it pops open..I come out to a puddle of hot coffee leaking over the counter to the floor. I have been forced to use a work around.Freezer tape. It secures the door shut but really looks classless. We remove it after the coffee is done & when not in use. My biggest problem aside from having to mop up coffee, is removing the grinder basket. I have resulted to removing the filter basket turning the coffee maker upside down trying to remove the blades and was forced to run hot water thru the grinder basket down thru the screen because it was clogged,(HUMIDITY!) and this while trying to keep the filter door and sliding mechanism open...I have the Owners manual and it only says remove the grinder basket....Does ANYONE have any help!?????"
2,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this coffemaker brand new in December 2008. It performed well but was a major pain each day because the coffee grinder must be washed each time it's used. After a year, the filter basket door started popping open, sporadically, while the coffee was brewing, creating a major mess all over the counter. Now, I have to stand watch while the coffee is brewing. So much for using the programed brewing feature unless want I want to clean up a major mess when I enter the kitchen each morning."
2,Does not completely brew,"I purchase this machine refurbished from another online company. Unfortunately my warranty was only for 90 days because 5 months later, it does not completely empty the water reservoir when I brew. I have to press the start button several times in order to get the machine to empty it completely. I did a search on reveiws after the fact, and found that this is a VERY common problem and no way to fix it. Think twice before spending so much on this coffee maker. I loved it when I first got it but now I am very frustrated. ALso, when you don't use the grinder, it fills with steam and you have to wipe it all off before the next time you use it. Too much work for one cup of coffe!"
2,Disappointed,"Ditto from the above review about the lining of the thermal pot flaking over time. The most disappointing aspect though, has to be the coffee drawer flicking open during brewing for no reason at random...causing quite a mess. Not a good design."
3,Good coffee... to a point.,"We have been using this machine in a busy accounting office, both for employees and hospitality to our clients. It makes decent coffee - though I believe that is more a function of knowing the right amount of grounds to use per cup and good filters - but my praise for it stops there.The thermal carafe, while it keeps the coffee warm and fresh for a good long time, is slowly losing it's lining... into our coffee cups. The little bits of what I can only assume is teflon are just not very appetizing.Also, the built-in grinder does a fine job of breaking down coffee beans, but fills with condensation - to the point where there is a puddle around the blades, with every brew cycle and I am starting to notice some rust on the blades.With all this in mind, I am here on Amazon today shopping for a new coffee maker, and I will not be purchasing this machine again! I am sure there are better thermal carafe designs out there."
2,Okay if you don't need to use a lot of beans,"I don't have any trouble with this machine, now that I have accepted the fact that I can't make 10 full cups of coffee with it. The problem is you can't put enough beans into the grinder to get a decent 10 cups of coffee. I don't think I like super strong coffee, but when I filled the grinder as far as the instructions allowed for, and added water up to the 10-cup line ... it was weak coffee. So, to make up for that, I make only 8 cups, with the grinder filled to capacity, and I use a darker roast. I've gotten used to it, but am definitely looking for something better."
1,cuisinart grind & brew terrible,"Don't buy the Cuisinart Grind & Brew Automatic Coffeemaker! If you buy this item, you will wake up to the following: The filter basket pops out during the grinding process spilling ground coffee beans into the back of coffee maker and everywhere but into the filter basket and then the water runs out on your counter and onto your floor. What a shock to wake up to in the morning. Before we returned it, we no longer trusted it to set it for automatic brew and would stand in front of the machine and push the basket back in throughout the brewing process (sometimes up to three times!). Avoid this product or any of the cuisinart grind and brews! The normal cuisinart coffee maker works just fine!"
1,cuisinart DGB_600BC over priced & over rated,"We bought ours new from Younkers Dept. Store for $150.00, it will grind coffee and make coffee. Thats about the best you can say for this over rated and over priced coffee maker. The coffee is not hot enough when it is made and the insulated carafe does not keep it hot. We have to reheat the coffee on stove to boiling and pour it into the carafe, then it cools down within a couple of hours. If you do not watch very carefully you can overfill water reservoir which overfills the carafe and then it will run over ruining whatever it sits on. I would say any $15.00 brewer will do a better job."
1,a lot of work,"I like the machine i got used to. Was well worth it for the price! I could not change the stars,though."
1,Waste of Money,I bought this reconditioned Cuisinart from Amazon less than 8 months ago and it is a piece of s**t. It is third reconditioned item I have bought from Amazon that has been a piece of s**t and I am out $200+/-. It has almost quit grinding.
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought this coffee maker ,to get rid of the coffee grinds on my counter. But since I bought this my counter is a bigger mess.There is no way to measure your coffee beans,or to measure your water, as I have the stainless pot. It is a total mess to clean. I want my Krups and coffee grinder back, I can't get rid of it since I paid over $100 for it. Please listen do not buy."
1,Like weak coffee...this is your machine!,"I had one for about a month. Couldn't get it to make decent coffee....always watery. I emailed cuisinart...nothing. I returned it....(you might get my old machine!)I won't buy cuisinart again, for anything. It is one thing to make a poorly designed product, and another to just ignore a customers request for help in getting it to work."
3,Good but not quite there.....,"We recently purchased one of these to save counter space and stop getting coffee grounds all over the counter top. We've achieved that! Unfortunatly, it just falls short in one BIG area.....It doesn't keep you coffee HOT or WARM for that matter very long. Granted if you drink your coffee within the first 30 min of making your it you'll probulby be OK. But if your like me and like to enjoy it over time or can't drink a pot that quickly it doesn't stay hot. I'm probubly going to return mine and get the older version with the glass pot that keeps the coffee a drinkable hot.I had high hopes but it just falls short of my expectations."
1,Expensive junk,"I received this as a gift and, had I purchased it myself, it would have been returned the first day I used it. Coffee is weak and, even right after brewing, is barely hot enough. After 20 minutes or so in the insulated but not heated carafe, the coffee is only warm, not hot. Cleanup is a mess. Steam gets into the grinder mechanism during brewing leaving a wet slimy mess that needs to be thoroughly cleaned after each use. For the price, this is a ripoff. Buy yourself a decent grinder and a Krups. You'll save money and get better, hotter coffee."
2,NOT user friendly,"I have had many Cuisinart appliances and this is the first to disappoint. I purchased it because of the reputable brand name and the grinding option, but I have already lost my patience for this big letdown.There are too many pieces that have to be cleaned each time - EIGHT! - and just a rinse doesn't cut it because there is a ground coffee powder that builds up on the parts.The coffee doesn't flow easily from the carafe - I have to tip the entire carafe upside down in order to get the coffee out. I don't want to have to dislocate my shoulder every time I want a cup of coffee.The pre-heating of the carafe is an extra nuisance step.Would not recommend."
1,junk,"i've used this for approx a year, daily cleaning, the sound of a jet taking off in the morning. It did make ok coffee. It developed a nasty habit of the filter door popping open turning the grind process, making a really big mess. i've cleaned, cleaned cleaned, this morning it happened again. After another hour of cleaning. i broke it into many pieces. Looking at the inside, i now see what a piece of junk it is, with a stainless steel veneer. Don't purchase. There must be better out there."
1,Don't Buy One!,"This has got to be the absolute worst coffee maker I have ever owned. Constantly leaks coffee all over the counter. Sometimes when the buzzer goes off letting you know the coffee is done, if you go to grab a cup of coffee its still filling coffee into the pot and you risk getting burned. I would never buy this brand again."
3,I could tell!,"Usually you can't tell the difference between reconditioned and new. But I could with this one! You could see signs that the carafe had been used before. There were also a few minor surface scratches by the buttons. And, the coffeemaker didn't come with the gold filter that new ones come with. Besides these issues, the coffeemaker seems to work fine so far..."
3,eh...,"In the beginning I loved this coffee maker. I found that the issues with water spilling were not an issue, and the coffee tastes great. After having this for a few years though, we hit a point where it leaks all over the counter every time, so we stopped using it. It seems that it is clogged up with coffee grounds or oils or something. We tried cleaning it really well, but it is not an easy thing to clean. I think if I could replace the filter, that might help. Anyway, I don't feel that it is any easier having a machine that has the grinder built in. It is sort of nice that you can set it up at night, set the timer, and have coffee ready in the morning, but I am never organized enough to use this feature. We have been using a Chemex and I am really happy to be using a simpler coffee maker with great tasting coffee."
1,waste of money,"This coffee maker leaked, over-flowed, gummed up and didn't last. The carafe, on the other hand, is great and now resides in our $20.00 Black and Decker. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours and will never break. Don't waste your money on this over-priced piece of garbage."
5,Great purchase,We wore out our previous Cuisinart Grind and Brew Coffeemaker so I decided to replace it with a factory-reconditioned model rather than purchasing a new one or waiting until the old one could be repaired. What a deal! Half the cost and it works even better than the new one did!
4,"Good coffeemaker, Good Price (it was factory-reconditioned)","We bought this coffeemaker last summer. At the beginning we were a little bit suspicious about this one being factory-reconditioned, but after reading other reviews and check the warranty offered by Cuisinart, we decied gave a shot. We're been using it every morning since then, without any issues or troubles. We're so happy and for future purchases we are considering others factory-reconditioned products ! ! !"
5,Coffee maker,"This coffee maker has been excellent so far- a discounted price for a full value- Grinds my coffee well, timer-preprograms it- No complaints. Price was 40 dollars cheeper than department store!!"
5,Reconditioned a good product,AGAIN THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT AT A RECONDITIONED PRICE. BIG HELP TO A RETIRED PERSON AND A PERFECT REPLACEMENT TO MY POD MACHINE.
1,they will never sell this to anyone who has ever owned one,"I bought this, BRAND NEW!!!!!! not re-manufactured, what a waste of money, and the manufacturer is hiding from those who have complaints, in shame, or perhaps greed, because they know they will have to throw more good money, after that which was badly spent, buying this poorly designed piece of doggy-doo, they should recall it, and having it here for sale proves it is NOT reconditionable... witness the long line of truthful complaints against it, each one represents a machine that has been proven worthless not once, but 2 or more times!!! BUYER BEWARE!!! every complaint you read bears repeating, as they are all true, come here I can prove it!!! to make much better coffee, for much, much longer than this works, you only need $3.88 to spend on black friday at walmart for their cheapo machine"
1,Damaged Goods,"[[ASIN:B00021RFY6 Factory-Reconditioned Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew Coffeemaker, Brushed Chrome]This is the second ""reconditioned"" Grind and Brew Coffeemaker I've bought. The first one I bought at an outlet store and it was as good as a full-priced one. This recent purchase works fine, but was dented on the front. I guess I could have returned it but, for the price, decided to keep it. Bottom line - you get what you pay for. If you want a non-damaged product, pay full price. Had I known the product was dented, I would not have purchased it."
1,Faulty coffee pot,Bean grinder has to be shut off manually. Preset auto grind and brew feature does not work.
5,great grinder & coffeemaker,"my wife and I are ""coffee hounds"" and this machine makes GREAT coffee, whether from fresh ground or pre-ground. We saved $80 over retail at Bed Bath & Beyond."
2,Cheaply made,The price was fine compared to the retail but I have serious doubts that it will last as long as my previous coffeemaker which was made in Switzerland not China. I only bought this one to save electricity by keeping the coffee warm without a burner. I haven't used the grinder part and never will because it collects condensate so it is always damp. Bad design. Cuisinart used to mean quality. I'm dissapointed.
3,Coffee Connaisseur,This is a great coffee maker in design and function on that I love it. The down side that I see is the grind function which I will explain. For a standard drip coffee maker the grind of the coffee should be about 1/16 in size ground particle that would be on dial number grinder between 3 and 4. The grinder it self on this coffee maker is just like any other and works as it should. The problem is the non-removable metal screen the holes are too big and allows the grind to be to big for a drip system. The size of the grind that goes into the coffee filter basket is ideal for a French press but not a drip system so the result is a coffee lacking full flavor and aroma. So my score is a 3 for design and function with negative 2 for not producing a good brew of coffee if it was not for that I would have given a 5
2,Two Times Over,"I received this coffee maker as a gift and my initial thought was wow! Beautiful machine. I used it daily for approximately 4 months, enjoyed the brew but then reality set in. Started noticing the excessive water condensation and messy clean-up. At about 10 months the pumping cycle began to shorten therefore leaving water in the reservoir. I was up to three power cycles before producing a full pot of coffee. I contacted Cuisinart - no response. It was put out to trash. Christmas roles around and whats under the tree.....yes, same model given to me by a friend. Lets just save that experience and simply carbon copy the original. However, the second one did last 15 months! This model obviously has poor design and Cuisinart is in denial."
2,"Fantastic coffee, but leaks!","This coffee pot makes the best coffee of any coffee maker I've ever owned. But after a while it will leak all over the counter. I returned it, got another brand and after a while it did the same thing. I love the coffee from this machine, but I am looking for another coffee maker now. Any suggestions?"
1,Bad Design,Love coffee. Hate this machine. Poor design. Doors never stay shut. Spills coffee and grinds over everything without warning. Very hard to keep clean.
3,Worked great for 4 years until .....,"I've loved this coffee maker; for four years we've awakened to delicious hot coffee. I love the programmable function. It IS loud, but now we don't need an alarm clock. And it's messay, cleaning out the grinder can be a pain. All in all it was worth it until ... TONIGHT! I pour water in the reservoir to set up the machine for tomorrow's brew and it immediately starts pouring out the bottom! We can't figure out where it's coming from. Everything has been fine until now. I was wondering if anyone else had this problem."
5,Cuisinart DGB-600 grind and brew,"Makes and excellent cup of coffee! If you've never had a cup of coffee brewed in just seconds after grinding the beans, then this is a must have. I was intially worried about the multiple reviews that discussed the extensive cleaning before every use. But all that is required is a quick rinsing after each use of the grinding parts and I just let them drip dry in a rack before using again. Rinsing takes less than a minute, and is definately worth the outstanding cup of coffee as a result. I've found it's best to rinse as soon after brewing as possible, before the coffee has had a chance to dry to the parts, and it then rinses right off. Couldn't be happier with it."
2,review of Cuisinart coffee maker,"Makes great coffee and nice and hot, but the whole inside, especially the part that grinds the beans, gets all wet, and you have to take it all apart, which is not easy, each time you use it, and dry it all out between uses, which is a pain. It is not easy to use."
1,Cuisinart is French for,"Junk!!!! This is the second Cuisinart appliance I have owned. The first one I bought and this one was a gift. It worked great at first. Waking up to a freshly ground cup of coffee. But now the door for the coffee grinds basket pops open after the grinder goes off and I end up with a huge mess on my counter. Today I even stood by while it ground the beans and held the basket shut. After it started I left, and it still managed to open. I am putting my BUNN back in service. The other Cusinart I had was a blender and it started leaking. Save your money. Do not buy this or any of their products."
2,Not a time saver,Overall I am unhappy with this purchase. I did not realize that it required cleaning (of the ENTIRE unit) after each brewing cycle. The grinding portion of the unit is an absolute mess after brewing as moisture from the brewing cylcle combines with the grounds. It is more than a simple rinse to clean.I also have experienced frequent grounds in my coffee and occasional leakage as noted by others. I will be seeking a new unit soon.Overall I am dissatisfied and would not recomend this unit to anyone.
2,amazing machine but unsatisfactory coffee,"Unfortunately, this machine can only make weak coffee. I tried loading up with extra beans (using top-quality beans) without success. Mechanically, it is a wonderful machine and I experienced none of the problems reported by others. I would have liked to keep it because it is great to wake up to the aroma and freshly ground and brewed coffee."
2,Great coffee/BIG problems !,"I've had my Grind and Brew Coffeemaker for a year and a half now. While it makes superb coffee, I am fearful everytime I use it. I went through the initial problems with the filter door popping open, but that was easily solved. NOW, for some reason, the coffee won't be sucked into the pot each and every time, so just when I begin to trust it again, BAM, hot coffee is all over my brand new maple hardwood flooring ( now WARPED where the coffee spilled onto it). I have kept the parts clean; I run a special coffee maker cleaner through it once a month, but to no avail. A coffee maker as expensive as this one should last much longer than 18 months."
1,Poor engineered coffee grinder,Makes good coffee but grinder lid breaks very often and has to be replaced. Since the lid is costly to replaced we bought a separate Krups grinder. Cusinart does't answer e-mails about the problem. Look at the number of recondition makers for sale and draw your own conclusions.
2,"insane, dope smoking engineers designed this","Had the original Toshiba until it died ; no longer is that one made. We bought the ugly round Cuisinart, which lasted for 5 years until it just quit working. Way too expensive to pack it up for repair, so we decided to try this attractive chrome job :(it is difficult to clean, often drips and is altogether unreliable. Because it has a thermal carafe, I expected it to keep coffee hot for more than one hour, but no luck. So I have to force open the lid right after brewing (apparently is gets vapor lock) and transfer contents to another thermos. I am on the prowl for another grind and brew (probably a Melitta)and ran across this opportunity to review this ill designed Cuisinart, so decided to save some other folks the grief we have had with it. Only get one if somebody promises to pay you to use it."
3,Not quite there,"It seems like such a great idea - an integrated grinder and coffee maker. Certainly it works, but . . . Good coffee beans are oily so even if you have a separate grinder, you have to clean it after use or use an implement to get the compacted coffee out. The integrated grinder has an even greater problem - condensation. It's always wet so the coffee sticks even more. At the outlet port to the grinder is a grill which can easily clog up. The bottom line is that you have to clean the entire grinder assembly after each use. Whatever time you save at the front end, you spend on the cleaning. Sorry to Cuisinart, but it's easier and cheaper to have a $50 coffee maker and a $20 grinder."
3,Cuisinart Grind and Brew,"I had one of these before that I bought brand new. I received two replacements and eventually the grinder stopped working. I purchased this one because I love the coffee pot and didn't want to buy another at full price. It arrived in decent condition, there were some scratches on the stainless steel. Also, the grinder gets stuck in the unit so I had to purchase another grinder for $15 from Cuisinart. Overall, I love the coffee pot when it works."
5,the best coffee maker in the world.,"this coffee maker is very convienient and easy to use. only downside, it sounds like a car crashing when it grinds the beans... especially at 4am."
1,ICK!!! coffee..,"We received our Cuisinart Coffee maker, made coffee immidately.It was undrinkable.So we waited until the evening:still BAD.Tried the next morning;Bad.So I'm sending it back. I have all Cuisinart cookware it is all wonderful. We were very disapointed that this was not as good. Also,Starbuck coffee was used."
3,Product Is a gift,"This product is a gift so i haven't seen it work yet, however the package was mailed in great condition. I expect the product will be just as good"
1,Broken and Loud Cuisinart Grind and Brew,"This is the second one of these we have owned, this is being returned. Great idea, just does not last long. Second one lasted two weeks before the pot fell apart.Would not purchase again until they can make it last."
3,luddite,Caraffe a clumsy pour. Lots of parts to clean. Good coffee. I think separate grinder and coffeemaker are more practical.
1,Duped,"Remember, you do get what you pay for. The outside of the machine was not totally clean around the seams, making me feel compelled to clean the inside throughly a few times. There were also scatches on the plastic parts. I am not generally on an onlone shopper and this product reconfirms my need to see and inspect a product before buying or at least be able to bring it right back to the store if not satisfied."
2,Cheap.,"Within 3 months these binders started tearing and separating. I was not transporting them around, I just put them in a book case in my apartment. With a lot of duct tape, I was able to hold everything together - but overall these binders were more of a hassle than a help. In this case, the word cheap applies to both cost and quality of the product.I am giving these 2 stars because with all the tape, I can still use them, but I will not be buying them again."
3,Great Product,Great product. But company didn't send me notification that my item had shipped so I had to contact them. That's why they received 3 stars.
2,"good in person, not so good at home","i saw anointed at toccoa fest, and immediately went and bought the album. i was disappointed, only enjoyed a few songs. the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping. dont waste your time and money"
4,Herpetologist's delight,"Very accurate depiction of some of the less common reptiles running amuck. Didn't immediately recognize Elliott without his ""signature 'stache"". After the scene with Milland & Elliott one wonders why it wasn't titled ""snakes""."
3,No Frogs Here,"3 stars as far as B movies go.Following gratuitous poisoning, destruction, and pollution of nature... nature will oft return to have her way with you.Funny enough by the title, one would expect some frogs to participate in the carnage, however only one frog showed up for the two days of production and filming (as it could not have taken longer than that). The lone bullfrog, assisted by his army of toads (not frogs) and various other reptilian and amphibian cohorts, single web-footedly take down an entire family of rich eccentrics.For bad movie night, it is perfect... especially for anyone with an ecology or biology background (you'll just love the selection of animals). However, we suggest watching it in Spanish as it helps to get all the pesky bad dialog out of the way.One further suggestion: never ever, ever play a drinking game which involves imbibing with each instance of toad or 'frog'. The hangover will not soon be forgotten, luckily, the film will.A true fourth of July favorite."
4,Daddy Sam,Buy this movie for Sam Elliott if for no other reason. What a beautiful specimen of manhood. He fills out his jeans sooooo well and takes off his shirt to show that awesome hairy chest. Oh yes...there are frogs in the movie too!
3,Frog get me...not,"Ray Milland the star of such blockbusters as ""The Man with the X-ray Eyes"" and ""The Thing with Two Heads"" does it again with ""Frogs"". The filming takes place in and around an 1890s mansion in Florida's Eden State Park.Jason Crockett (Ray Milland) hates all those creepy crawly critters that have no right to live. He at least does something about it. Well it is his birthday and his creepy crawly relatives are visiting.It is bad enough that he is confined to a wheel chair but he will soon have some other birthday guests.Will everyone croak?The Thing with Two Heads"
4,Worth Seeing,"I would have to say, this is one of very few movies, that actually made me scream out loud. This film is not the best in the world, but its not the worst either. Some scenes Mystery Science Theater 3000, could have fun with. The end of the credits with the frog, and the hand sticking out of his mouth, that was good, I liked it, and wasn't expecting it either. I thought all the actors were good in it, including Ray Milland (from one of my favorite movies: ""Panic in Year Zero"", he was the director and star of the film). The cinematography was good in ""Frogs"" even through, you could see the shadow of the cameraman and the camera once in awhile, definitely in one running scene you could see the shadow of both the camera and the cameraman. All in all, I give this movie a 4 Stars. It was pretty good, and worth seeing. Check It Out!"
3,A classic B movie,"As a kid, I got really, really scared by this film. Now it's a bit more 'painful' to watch in a different meaning, but it still has some charms as a classic B movie."
2,"""Frogs"" is NOT the dumbest movie to ""leap"" from the 70's!","No, Bill, that singular distinction belongs to the classic camp of ""Night of the Lepus"", the story of marauding giant bunnies in the American southwest.Compared to that turkey, ""Frogs"" is Shakespeare!"
3,So how bad is bad?,"BAD!..thats all that fits this truly one of a kind stink fest. However, this movie has ups and downs and sometimes it even looks like it tries, maybe..just maybe, it would have been better if it had a ""made to look like a monster frog"" in the movie which could of saved it, but, then again, maybe not..cause the story line was just awful it couldn't be saved. But, in all honest its just a rental pure and simple."
2,False advertising!,"One night, my friend and I were looking in the video store for a ""so bad its good"" cheesy horror movie and when we came across ""Frogs,"" we thought this was our ticket. What could possibly be better then man-eating frogs? Well, the title of the film is a bit misleading. You see the frogs really do nothing in the movie. You just see close-ups on them croaking. The snakes and leeches and other reptiles do the dirty work. Perhaps the frogs are the leaders and the other animals their army? The film is just terrible and there is nothing funny about it. ""Frogs"" looks like it will be a fun movie to watch and mock but it's just rancid and awful."
2,A really awful film,"This is a bad movie and it is not to be confused with ""bad"" movies that are so awful that they are entertaining. This is just slow moving, tedious stuff. There is no intended or unintended humor here. The script is bad, but not so absurd that you will laugh. It looks like a cheaply made TV movie. Just a piece of junk."
4,Fantastic B movie,I saw this movie a long time ago and it stuck in my memory. This is a timeless classic and I liked it a lot.
3,Atmospheric nature gone amok film,"There's good atmosphere in this nature gone wild film. Despite the title, the frogs don't do much in the film. People are killed off by assorted other creatures from a swamp like snakes, alligators, and spiders. It's still pretty fun after all these years and it seems to have aged well. It's good for a creepy late night viewing or a rainy day. I wouldn't say it's as good as some of the other nature gone amok films like SQUIRM, GRIZZLY, and DAY OF THE ANIMALS. However, it's still entertaining with fairly good replay value. There's very little blood and there's no nudity. It's also a little bit slow in the beginning and it gets a little talky at times. However, I like the place where the made the film."
3,So so,"I picked this movie up because it was under $5, and it looked moderately entertaining. That was what I got. I probably won't watch it again, but I found it entertaining still. The movie itself isn't that great, but the absurdity of the story and the blatant bad acting make it actually more entertaining. If you can get this movie for cheap, you might want to consider it, but don't get your hopes up."
3,Big green dumb fun,"This is NOT a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but it's a lot of fun to watch. I find myself doing my own MST3K type schtick during campy B films and Frogs provides perfect fodder. Go into it knowing what it is and you'll probably enjoy it. But if you're buying or renting a ""horror"" film called Frogs you probably have some idea what to expect."
3,It's not easy being GREEN...,"Set in a southern bayou location, the movie stars Ray Milland with a young Sam Elliot and Joan Van Ark who find themselves in a ""day of the animals"" scenario. This outing concerns itself with cold-blooded critters - attacks are carried out by snakes, lizards, and crocodiles - the frogs apparently summoning and controlling their marshy minions by means of incessant croaking. (An actual frog-attack is saved for the finale.)The DVD quality is very high, with choice of Wide or Full Screen. The actors play it straight the whole way through, apparently oblivious to the campiness of the material. This adds to the appeal of the film, making it a worthy entry into the MGM Midnite Movies collection. More ""ribbet-ing"" than riveting, but fun. Add a star if you like Ray Milland. (Tip: Buy ""X-The Man with X-Ray Eyes"" starring Milland.)"
3,Unintentionally Hilarious!,"There's something perverse to love about a film in which a man dies due to a poisonous snake attack, two main characters discuss this and decide to keep it quiet...but then both of these characters have no qualms at all about letting everyone else wander off by themselves and risk their lives.But, plot and sense are not what this movie has to offer.It is just a wonder that such a film exists! Good cast, mostly good photography....but in service of such an oddball story.This is the kind of movie that has you looking at the corners of the screen rather than the center. It is full of minor distractions and strangely placed details.But it is unsettling too in the casual way the victims are disposed of...however, this is handled in such a bizarre manner that we are never convinced for a moment that the blood is anything but fake."
1,"Action! (hop, hop, hop) Cut! Brilliant!","There is something very ironic about this movie, and that is the fact that the frogs never hurt anyone. They just hop around on the corpses of people who are killed by other critters. Needless to say, this is about as riveting as it sounds. This movie is not scary. It is not funny, even in a campy way. It tries to take itself seriously and expects its audience to be somehow stirred by the sight of a lizard crawling on top of some rich schmuck who tripped and fell down... and then apparently died from shame, since I fail to see how an iguana sitting on said schmuck's abdomen caused a fatal injury. This movie does not deserve to be called stupid. It is beneath stupidity. It attempted stupidity and failed. But at least it kept Hollywood's animal wranglers busy for a day or two. Enjoy!"
1,"Frogs hops and flops...scary, no....funny? YES!","Frogs and amphibians get angry after a wealthy land owner plants poison to kill creatures that he considers 'a nuiscance'.Sam Elliot is cool as the always macho hip dude to save the day from anyone dying, although he missed a few...haha....Although the frogs aren't physically menacing...they are good at strategizing or guiding other creatures for a meal or good ol' killin'.So many times, I wish that the frogs themselves got (so impossibly) deadly for a laugh, even just hopping all over the road, or even in the house, then the people trip over them and fall, or something.Ah, anyways, Frogs is real fodder.....frog fodder.Very funny...worth an evening to see if you got [money] to throw away....."
1,awful....,"This is one awful flick! I mean come on, animals getting revenge and doing stupid stuff. This film is a stupid B-movie. All frogs do in this film is ribbit and try to break into the mansion in this house. Every other animal does stuff like lizards knock poison over. Overall, this is a terrible movie, don't see it."
1,Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 Compatible,"The description of this product is very misleading. They say it is compatible with Windows but they forget to mention that it works with Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. I was looking forward to viewing many quality photographs of Africa, but I quickly discovered that the disks were developed with now obsolete software. After a lot of work loading an old version of QuickTime software from Apple, I was able to view only a small number of the photographs. The photographs are low resolution conversions of analog photographs. The disks use ""Project Skeleton"" software from Macromedia. By today's standards the sound and picture quality is very inferior. Many of the photographs are buried in .dir files that Macromedia reads and cannot be viewed directly from the disks.Stay away from this product unless your only computer runs Windows 95."
5,One ofthe best books written about Race-Relations in America,I thought this was one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading. This book gose into why some African Americans and White Americans veiw sex and race different.
2,Don't take her out of the package!!!!!!,"The paint application is the worst I have ever seen on a ""Marvel Legends""!!!!!! I'm probably going to have my fiance re do the paint.One of my favorite things about the ""Marvel Legends"" line of action figures is the articulation. But, for the first time the articulation ruins the figure. I had a really hard time getting her to look good standing up.My recommendation...is to get the M.O.D.O.K. build a figure another way. If you want a Jessica Drew Spider-Woman, try the ""Marvel Select""."
1,Total junk,I've used this maybe 5 times and the blade is already pitted. Is it made of aluminum foil or something?
5,"Working in a kitchen, you get cuts","I use this as my go-to cream for all sorts of uses, minor cuts, shaving cuts, abrasions, burns, etc, it really does wonders to speed up healing (it is an antiseptic)I love this product and am glad its available"
3,small town folk will gain much from this,"Nicholas returns home to New Zealand (my home country) and is dying. This is a complex, yet richly laid out novel with great characters that come together to explore the class and relationship struggle. Inherant small-town dynamics paly an intergal role in this story as race and love clash in a powerful and haunting triptych. I found this righly evocative as the stoy unrolled to reveal relationships between cultural roots, more of the time and our deepest emotions."
2,Depressing and a long boring draggggg....,Plot of the story is simply wacked. Boyfriend leaves you and you hunt him down some 10 years later. Nuff said.
4,good record,"I just bought this record and didn't really know what to expect of it, since I only knew Vai from Roth's 'Eat 'em and Smile'. This album is so much better... There are some catchy tunes, both in the instrumental and vocal tracks, and everything is executed in perfection. Only comment I have is that some stuff comes across as 'musician's music', so that not everything hits you like it should, and possibly could. BTW:'hand on heart' somehow sounds very familiar to me"
4,Vai is god,"Vai is god. Any arguments to that? The 1st phase is just Awesome, with a capital A!!!i've given it only a 4 star rating (out of 5 of curz) coz the 2nd phase ain't lives up to the precedent set by the 1st phase. but dudes, 2nd phase is kool too! no arguments there.just wait till u hear Fire garden suite! WOW!"
4,"Not Passion and Warfare, but still great...","Instrumental tracks were outstanding, but not along in the same vein as Passion and Warfare. I'm not saying that everyone of Vai's cds should be like Passion and Warfare, but, every time I listen to his other cds, I don't get the same musical drive as I did in P&W. Steve, if you're reading this, take note. Incorporate more jazz and classical ideas. Heck, put out a jazz album like Frank did. And remember, don't ever go commercial, or you'll lose your fan base. Remember what happened with S&R (still a good album btw)? :) Vai is still a guitar wizard and a musical prodigy though...later."
4,"Excellent Album, but not what I was expecting.","First off, I have to say that my favorite guitarist is without a doubt, Joe Satriani. He is the one who inspired me to take up guitar. I heard of Steve Vai first when I bought the excellent G3 Album, and I loved Steve's tracks, thus I decided to buy a Vai album. Firegarden is an amazing piece of work, but not what I was expecting. His style is quite different from Satch, with more focus on the lyrics and song structure, at least in this album. Vai deffinatley breaks down and shreds on this album, and he is amazing, however I feel he falls short of Satch. I was expecting a more rock and shred album, but the songs are more sweeping and passionate. Don't get me wrong, the album does rock hard in spots, I mean, it opens with an explosion! At any rate, this is a great guitar album, with really unique sounds, that every guitarist should look into."
3,Another hit and miss recording from Mr. Vai,"The first disc is quite good, a lot of diverse instrumentals. Vai mixes some slow numbers with some faster ones, but the overall theme is mellow. The second disc sounds like a recording from a 1980s hair band. I can appreciate that Vai is an intelligent man and desires to communicate with his audience, but words are not necessary to do this, they really aren't. Satriani, Beck and Schencker have always been at their best when they just let the guitar do their talking. Mr. Vai is also at his best when he just lets the Ibanez speak for him. ***** for the first disc and * for the seond disc, I curbed up the final score for a ***."
3,Should be a 3.5,"This is a pretty good album with quite a few great songs, but then you have several mediocre songs. I was kind of let down with this album. I have had many of Vai's other album, and had a friend rave about a lot so I figured I would give it a shot. Alien Love Secrets, and Passion & Warfare along with G3 Live really are great albums, but if you listen to this album after listen to one of those you will wonder if it is even Vai playing on it."
3,"Good, but not his best","I have mixed feelings for this CD as a whole. It's a mix of 1)groundbreaking, exciting, powerful Steve Vai material that we've all come to love over the past years and 2)crap. Steve Vai plays guitar; he does not sing and when he doesn't follow this simple ideology, he fails. All the guitar-only/ no vocal pieces rock. Basically, I took this 21 track CD, and copied the songs I liked to make a 10 track cassette. It's a great cassette. I'll probably never listen to the CD, again."
5,Plenty of Fun!,"This is an excellent cookbook! Sarah's chef is definitely on the road to ""celebrity chefdom."" The recipes are creative and interesting, and most of them are quite simple. I can understand why Sarah takes a chef on the road with her. Can you imagine having sumptuous meals prepared for you three times a day? Paradise."
5,Sarah has good taste!!,"Wow! I love this book! I never thought healthy food could be so good! I love having the taste of some different foods in my mouth. Usually, in Wisconsin, all there is to eat are brats and beer. My favorite recipes are the Fennel-Calarmari Salad, the Thai Salad Rolls, Tiger Prawns with Soba Noodles, and Sweet Surrender Lobster with Candied Ginger and Mango Herb Butter. I also LOVE Ash and Sarah's Chai Tea. I am so glad Sarah put this book out. I love all the pictures in there also. Especially the ones of her singing on stage and the ones with her dog, Rex. Sarah has good taste!!!"
5,YOU NEED THIS CD!!!!,"I first saw this band open up for a 311 concert years ago, and i never remembered a band with such energy!!! I kept my eyes open for this CD and one day i finally found it.... it still has yet to leave my CD player. Master of Syles is a great CD also, but I must say it can't compete with this one. I have seen the band twice since then, and they were GREAT, the most nuts i've ever gone at any concert. Not quite ska, not punk, i really don't know what to call it, but i LOVE it. This CD had made this band one of my favorites so i highly recoment you check it out."
5,Awesome!,"The Urge is an awesome rock band. A lot of the music has a reggae feel, but it rocks. They also put on a great live show. Highly recommended."
2,This Is Pretty Disappointing,"Yeah, so this band actually has this awesome song, called ""It's My Turn To Fly,"" from theTitan A.E.: Music From The Motion Picture (2000 Film)soundtrack, which made me want check out more of their music. This band is one of the rare instances that has one incredible song, and the rest of their entire body of music is just, not good at all. And this is coming from someone who loves funk-metal (311, Red Hot Chili Peppers, even Primus). I don't know, maybe it's just me, but this album is awful. It could just be the album cover, maybe, which is disturbing."
5,"Non-stop ""flavor""","I have been a fan of The Urge for quite some time, and I can easily say that this is one of their best CD's. Unfortunately for most consumers, and fans of the group, most of their older stuff is no longer being printed. This CD is fast, energetic, and just plain awesome. I would suggest it to anyone who wants to hear some exciting new sounds."
2,"Well written, but boring!","This book just goes on and on and on with the life of Sarajean. I just couldn't get interested in all the things and people that floated in and out of Sarajean's life. The book was readable, but there are a lot better books out there"
4,a light and delightful book!,"""Little Miss Strange"" is a very interesting book. One of the most casual but yet funniest book that I've read in awhile. This book is very detailed about the atmosphere, emotions, and thoughts. From Sara Jean's clothes to good transitions on her family situations in the 70s. This book didn't keep me in my feet and isn't much of an exciting page turner, but it is a good book to read at your leisure because it has a lot of heart in it."
3,Could have been better,It's a fast easy read but I was disappointed. I felt there was so much potential with the characters in the book but it didn't go anywhere. I've met lots of young people who had parents like the adults in this story. Mothers and fathers who wasn't active in their children's life if they were around at all. Kids need and want supervision. Some like Sarajean will look for it and some will act out like Lelana.
3,Coma Virus - AKA Paul Haslinger,"Coma Virus is a side project for former Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger. On ""Hidden"" he explores pure ambient territory, somewhat reminiscent of Lightwave. Mostly a construction of sounds as opposed to ambient offerings of, say Brian Eno. Melodies are barely hinted at here, as the focus is on the sonic aspects. I don't really get into ambient that much, but I do have a few in my collection, and whie this one isn't completely satisfying, it isn't completely pointless either."
4,A Good Introduction to the Old Arabists,"Arabists, at least the ""old"" generation, tend not to like this book because they feel that it unfairly stigmatizes them as hopelessly affected with clientitis, diplomats who have ""gone native,"" and who are fundamentally biased towards Israel and out of touch with U.S. interests. Yet in highlighting these Arabists Kaplan provides an excellent introduction to the field: the legendary figures of the U.S. Foreign Service in the Arab world, among them diplomats like Bill Eagleton, Richard Parker, and Hume Horan. Also included are some of the ""new"" Arabists like Alberto Fernandez, who as of this writing heads up the public diplomacy efforts of the Near East Bureau in the State Department. He's one of the few U.S. government officials whose Arabic is good enough to frequently appear on Al-Jazeera talk shows."
4,"One-of-a-kind, but not Kaplan's best","Not Kaplan's best, but that's because the subject was difficult to follow. Most of the diplomats were rather obscure and unaccomplished names in history - either teachers / professors or evangelical Christians at or around the American University of Beirut - so not the easiest to follow. Fact is, that not until recently have somewhat scholarly people begun to pay attention to the Middle East - Arab nations. Hence the term 'Arabists' connoted a unique and elite group of arabophiles - a rare breed these days, but not quite as uncommon as say a century ago."
3,Mixed,"Worthwhile in its wealth of information but one must be wary of a book on this topic originally published by a publisher (Atlantic Monthly) whose owner Mort Zuckerman is fanatically pro-Israel. This book does overlook the fact that Arabists have been consistently ineffective far more than the highly questionable assumption that Arabists have been ""consistently wrong."" Further, it assumes that non-support for Israel by them is some sort of mental disease that results from either anti-Semitism or mysterious thought processes created by learning the Arabic language instead of resulting from the Arabists' close familiarity with the situations of the Palestinians who were creully disgregarded and even more cruelly disposseed in establishing the state. Those facts are not directly addressed at all and in that sense the book ""just doesn't get it."""
4,"Very good - not as great as his ""Balkan Ghosts"" but good.",Kaplan really does a good job in this book - I found the discussion of the Americans who lived in Lebanon at that time and who had relatives kidnapped or did not want American intervention interesting. I lived there during that time frame and understand what he seeemed to find as ironic.
2,After all these years...,"This movie scared the living daylights out of me when I watched it as a child. A word of advice: don't watch this movie with young children around unless you want them to develop a phobia of extraterrestrials. To a five-year-old, this is one terrifying movie."
2,Very creepy,"Okay I taped this movie a long time ago and the end got cut off. I know it got scarier and scarier. This is the creepiest movie. If anybody could please tell me what happened at the end of this movie, I'd like to know. I threw the copy of this movie away cause I could relate to this girl and the relationship she had with her mom, and I had very bad sleep problems after this movie! didn't want the copy around anymore!! I could never watch it again but, I really want to know what happened!!"
2,INACCURATE!,"If you analyze the ranking and ratings of this book, you will find very serious misrepresentations! Try to Compare two of your familiar cities one has low crime rate and the other much higher. What you will find is that they are about the same!! Try San Francisco and Oakland, San Jose and Richmond, CA. When you are looking for a safe place to live and raise your kids, you are likely ending up with a crime hovering place. I don't have any bias against rich or poor, but just the nature of the book--it is inaccurate and misleading!"
2,Roadworks outside your house,"In Fahey's Last Phase (96-01) he was experimenting like crazy and was telling everyone that all the old stuff was horrible, only his new stuff was any good. This of course was nonsense. He was just trying to be the oldest punk in town. The Trio work is Fahey at his most noisy, tuneless and experimental. Some of it just sounds like roadworks outside your house. Guitar, keyboard and a ton of effects, plus at times JF intoning very funny parts of liner notes to previous albums. It's fairly excruciating to my shell-like ears, but I'm aware that some folks LIKE this kind of thing - there are dozens of noise bands out there. Fahey's favourites were Einsturzende Neubauten - so if you like those bad boys, this is for you. But if you love ""Sunflower River Blues"" or ""The Death of the Clayton Peacock"" then invest in a pack of Anadin Extra before pressing Play. You have been warned."
3,Beautiful Bird House,"Waiting to see how it holds up over our harsh Canadian winters, but it looks great, out of the box! Very attractive. I am considering putting a coat or two of marine varnish on the exterior, before putting it out. A bit pricy to get ruined by the weather. Ought to be better made for the price, but it WAS made in China, so I have a pretty low expectation concerning longevity of the product. :-("
4,I like it!,"It explains specifically about how to take a picture and how to develope the film. I am really satisfied with this book. Actually, this book is used as my class's textbook. I'm photography student."
1,Basic Book for learners,This book is alright if you don't know anything about cameras. It goes through alot of the basics that you can figure out from your owners manual. If you are looking for a good book that teaches you about shutter speeds and f-stop numbers I would look at Understanding Exposure by Brian Peterson.
5,HOW CAN IT GET ANY BETTER?,"As a long time fan who own's almost everything Steve has done from the Dregs, Kansas, solo and Deep Purple, this is one of his best. The compositions are incredible and full of ""soul"". I honestly don't know how anyone could not appreciate this music. Each time I listen it gets better. Give yourself a treat and get this for yourself and someone who loves ""GREAT MUSIC""."
2,A bit of a snooze,"A lot more of his mellow stuff. One or two an album is a nice change of pace, but this was a lot of his neo-classical stuff back-to-back."
1,Just barely fit,Do ourself a favor and don't buy this cheap China replacement fan blower. You are better off buying from another company that has the OEM part or close to it - this is a sort of - kinda fits but not really part. Comes with foam strips (to fill in the large gaps you'll have) and a poor excuse of an electrical connector. Buying one with the squirrel cage will also save time and frustration and if you shop around will cost you the same - my mistake will hopefully help you.
5,Great!,This is one of the best children's books I have read in a long time...my kid's love hearing it and I don't tire of reading it again and again....Wonderful because it tells a true 'nature story' in such a whimsical way.
1,This book is awful~!,"If this is not the worst book i have ever read i dont know what could be. It seems that this book is an awful imitation of the book ""the hungry caterpillar""~! I enjoyed ""the hungry catterpilar"" but this book is so horrable it ruins ""The hungry catterpilar for me forever! This author is a horrible imitator of classic childrens illustration."
1,Missing the point,"I would have made it -5 stars had that option been available. The words are cute, the rhythm and repetition would naturally involve a young audience but this piece is an insult in its lack of understanding of the butterfly life cycle and its misrepresentation of the experience of creaures with which we share the planet--worthy only of a McDonald's advertisement or Barbie commercial. It is a money making venture period. Monarchs are popular today. Neither the author nor the illustrator tried to get to know any but the most rudimentary information about their subject or they would have known better. If it had been a similar handling of black people or cubans or asians, who are able to speak for themselves this book would have died a quick death on an editors desk. It speaks to how little we know or care about the natural world that it has gotten good reviews from Horn Book and Kirkus. I am deeply saddened."
4,Fun read,"My daughter read this book in her Kindergarten class in conjunction w/ growing butterflies, something we've also done at home. She really enjoyed it at school and is glad we read it at home now too."
5,Great information considering when it was published,"Considering this was first Published in 1979 I believe this to be a great book on the subject. The Drawing are not CAD drawings as this was before most people had computers or even the CAD software (which was very hard to find during that time). It shows you the steps needed from making the mag to the bluing of the finished gun.This is not a book for the person that thinks they can build a handgun over night to cause mayhem. It is for the person that has basic crafting skills with power tools. I highly recommend any book by Bill Holmes or P. A. Luty (he has several PDF's on his website). Having the knowledge to construct a weapon will come in handy down the road as Governments seek to remove everyone's rights to bear arms (US Constitution 2nd Amendment), not only in Europe but now in the America's too."
1,"Horrific materials, but fast shipping.","Definitely returning these, the quality is terrible.Disgusting synthetic leather that feels like it leaves a filmy residue on your hands, faux fur that absolutely reeks of plastic and a heel that I feel like I could snap off with my bare hands if I really tried. Also, the heel was not quite 4"" nor was the shaft of the boot high enough to be called a ""knee boot"", it reached about 3/4 of the way up my calf (and I don't half exceptionally long legs). The lacing is not at all attractive, it's very wide and difficult to tighten around the foot itself, but much easier around the leg. Overall, not an attractive shoe.On the other hand, shipping was fast, and I suppose you get what you pay for."
4,Good for what I wanted them for...,True to size...cute...perfect for my halloween costume. If you like heels these are good but my feet got sore from the arch after about a block. I wore them dancing all night and no blisters!
2,Sounds Great,"I thought the products mentioned all sounded great, but I could only find the JQuickTrans program useful. The other programs are good for begginers, but if you are an intermidiate learner, it might be tough to figure out where to go in the program."
2,Put me back in the class room!,"When I first bought this program, I was very excited. I had planned to use this as a supplement to another program I planned to buy later, figuring that it would give me the basics. The first CD was really helpful and I was ready to continue to learn with the second CD. Next thing I know I'm basically ready to throw the thing out the window! All the instructions are in Japanese, the words are in Japanese, and I sat there with a blank look. Looks like I'll be ordering the Complete Japanese software sooner than I thought."
1,don't try on XP,"Although it says it will run on Windows XP, I had big problems. If you have Windows XP, skip this software at least in its 203d version."
4,learning Japanese?,"I really enjoy using The Instant Immersion C.D. Roms, but it really is for people who have already begun learning Japanese using books or other methods. The first C.D. Rom starts you off with learning colors, numbers, and other simple beginner stuff but the second jumps right into speaking in Japanese and may be difficult for someone who hasn't learned beginning grammer such as Who, what, when, why, ect. in Japanese. The C.D. Roms are fun and is a good buy for someone who is interested in learning."
1,not so much,"I was torn between Instant Immersion and Rosetta Stone. Well, I.I. was 49 bucks while R.S. was 300 bucks. I tried I.I. I really did not enjoy this instant immersion software. Euro Talk could have done much better. Very poor interface, looks like a 10 year old programmed it. No real voice recognition, just a record/replay feature. Doesn't help. i quickly sent it back to the company for a refund and ordered R.S. no contest, R.S. wins by a landslide!"
1,Just awful,"I sure hope I can get my money back for this. I got the ""Deluxe"" edition from Costco and it comes with no documentation. I tried one of the programs and it was not intuitive (no way to back up) and only covered about 25% of the screen. Yuck!"
3,"Not too shabby, but it ain't Elhaz","Rather interesting little piece of work, this. The impression I get from it is that the band really didn't know what direction they wanted this album to take, and it bounces back and forth, both vocally (deep, evil growlings that sound exactly like Elhaz/calmer, happier stuff) and musically (bouncy techno/dark ambient). The Elhaz connection is so strong I found myself wondering, during ""The Ocean Inside,"" if this weren't Elhaz under another name, doing don't-worry-be-happy music. As such, I was getting ready to dismiss it, despite the fact that Elhaz' _The Black Rune_ is perhaps the most-played album at Goat Central over the past year and a half... then I hit the last track, ""Ocean of Disappearance."" Saves the whole album. Dark, foreboding waves of aural somnambulence to balance out the bouncy mediocrity of the rest of it. In short, not thoroughly awful, but I hope they release the last track somewhere else so I don't have to hang onto the whole disc."
5,The Best,"This is the BEST book for beginning friendship bracelet creators. I used it and learned from it, and I just bought this--the reissue--for my 8 year old niece. We had a great time this Christmas making bracelets together. What's great about this book is that it includes very easy types of bracelets, and very difficult types--something for everyone. The string that comes with it is fairly useless, but I bought a multi-pack of embroidery floss at the craft store to go with it, and it worked out perfectly. I also recommend large safety pins instead of using tape when you start a bracelet--holds much more securely and you can make bracelets in many more locations :)"
3,not quite what I expected,"What I expected: a book that listed synonyms and explained how they are different.What it is: a book that lists synonyms and gives several (4-8) sentences using each synonym, along with word frequency and ""register"" (how formal the word is).The book's layout is great, very clean and easy to use. The frequency and register notations are a great reference. But, and maybe this is my lack of knowledge of Arabic, I can't intuit the differences in usage from the sentences.In other words, this book works fine as a reference, but not so well as a teaching tool. I'm still glad I bought it, just wish it went a little bit farther..."
2,Poor quality materials,"Quality control is obviously NOT a priority for this company. Some of the wood appeared to be Home Depot rejects (splintered, and chewed up). One of the legs was mis-drilled by 1/4 inch and had to be redrilled to fit. Cheap staples that weren't completely driven in (include a hammer in your tool inventory if you're putting this thing together). Instructions were sparse and vague and the diagram was too small to be of any help. I'm highly suspicious of the rave reviews for this frame based on the product I received. Time will tell whether any comfort derived from this frame will outweigh the poor workmanship. Two weeks after contacting customer service - still no reply. Very disappointed!!!"
3,Quality issue,Queen Size Platform Bed fits together well but quality of finish leaves a lot to be desired. Some unfinished areas on wood that had to be sanded. Different color oak from board to board. Colors did not match.
2,Really???,"I'm writing this review 2 months after receiving the product due to the fact I'm a busy busy man, but I felt compelled to convey my experience. Firstly, the other reviews were spot on. If you are handy (which I am) you will get by re-constructing this mess of a designed or flawed bed frame with just a couple curse words. 1/2 the frame came stained (which I ordered) the other was not. The bolts packaged by the company were WRONG sizes and kind. I went to my local ACE hardware store and purchased the proper kind and size. The slats were cut too short and required a screw in each slat on the center support to ensure proper weight distribution...WOW. It was a headache of a project. Shame on these idiots for zero quality control. I will say for the $$$ it is oak and after my constructing the frame it is solid, but still a pathetic attempt by Room Doctor at selling an incomplete, poorly executed bed frame."
1,Terrible service,First I must say I've never written a review for anything I've ordered from Amazon including over 300 purchases but this one made me angry enough to write a terrible review for this companyit took room doctor three months to get this bed to meAfter a month and a half I sent them an email they responded on a Monday and said I should receive the bed on that Friday.it took three weeks after that Friday for the bed to be delivered. I received an email saying that they were waiting on a shipment of wood. And it wasn't till after I contacted Amazon and they were coming close to the maximum amount of days before the order be refunded by Amazon that I finally received an email with a shipping confirmationThe bed itself is fairly sturdy and have not had any issues with it although a lot of the boards were cracked and many were warped.Room Dr. sucks!!!! You can order the bed if you have three months to wait for to show up
5,Basic,"Very basic, the center beam is not as strong as it should be. I ended up cutting a 4x4 beam and putting it under the center to stop it from bowing. The frame itself is very nice light wood. I like it, I dont have any issues with sound. I soaped the wood to prevent squeaking as some reviews say occurs. I assume it worked because I have no sound issues"
1,The worst Battletech book I have read,Bad writing job and horrible plot. To be avoided!!! Find someone who writes a better Battletech story.
1,Whoever wrote this should be shot,"I can't believe FASA would dare to tarnish the BattleTech franchise with this drivel. Ridiculous plot, paper-thin characters. The much-hyped Solaris planet, which could have been such a great plot device is reduced to one remarkably un-astounding battle. Overall, a walking 300-page nightmare."
4,Do you want to know what Battletech is about?,"Read this book and find out. One of the best pictures of the battletech universe in my opinion. What are the hopes of a beaten but not broken soldier, the hardships of running a mercenary unit, and more. Better than the sequel by light years. Just do not try to play that battle against Morgan's forces with any hope of repeating the story of the book."
3,Grate book lots of action!,"This book was a good book. And I mean that it's not the best, but it's enjoyable. It's long, but keeps moving. I liked it, but it's hard for me to not like a book. I get cought up in them esily, but if I don't It's a bad, slow moving, horibly writen book. IT'S NOT THE CASE WITH THIS BOOK."
5,Hunt for the larger version,"There is a version that is the same book in hardback but LARGER that means the photos are too. The dimensions are 9 1/4"" x 10 3/4"" hardcover. This is printed on the inside of the dust jacket front that folds in.This is a lot bigger (taller and wider).by Klaus-Jürgen Sembach. Schirmer/mosel, Munich, 2000ISBN 3823821210Published in NY.It has the same 86 Duotones and 14 color illustrations, but is a previous larger size. Does it make a difference?YES. It makes the duotones 8x10 or larger in some cases.This is a must for your collection. For those who care there are only 3 or 4 old aged photos in the back. So ther rest are Audrey at the hight of beauty and glamour."
2,I'm trying Teachings on Love.,"I really want to like Thich Nhat Hanh's books. I want to because people I respect like them, because I believe in the value of mindful living... but the truth is that I didn't find this book very helpful.I have real and continuing struggles with Anger and this book while interesting in a round about way is, as others have mentioned, not directed toward the problem of anger. It is a mindful living remix.I'm going to keep searching for a great TNH book and when I do I'll recommend it. Good hunting."
5,"Gentle, humane, wise","Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk, writes with gentle compassion on how to care for the anger which is within all of us, and transform its negative energy into positive energy. His guidance on breathing, walking and acting 'mindfully', with stillness and concentration, is the most clear and helpful I've ever read.And this book is not relevant to anger alone. I have long been unsuccessfully fighting the craving to overeat - and found that when I simply noticed the craving lovingly and non-judgmentally, it lost its hold over me.For anyone who has wrestled unsuccessfully with anger and its consequences, I recommend this compassionate, practical book with all my heart."
1,No table of contents for the CD`,What a disappointment! There are 4 CDS and no printed guide whatsoever to either follow along or to locate a passage at a later time.Bogus
5,a book to shape the world,"if everyone read this book, I think our world would be a very differant place.its not a ""self help book"" its an explination of how the world works... how it should work, and how we can improve it by imporving ourselves.He talks about how mindfulness and self awareness can lead to better personal relations, and how how we talk to eachother, and what we listen to and watch and take in, can affect ourselves and our relationships.I started reading this book because I was looking for a book on Buddhism, and someone had recomended Thich Nhat Hanh to me I believe... and since then I've read it over and over because it has come to mean so much to me. I am trying very hard to take Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings to heart, and since I've done that, I think I've become a much more healthy and happy person. I've started to read other books he has written too, all I've savored any enjoyed.I highly recomend this book, there no better investment for your $10. hehe"
3,Simple steps to control anger,This explains how one must own one's thoughts and steps to taking that ownership. Simple yet deliberate ways of thinking that teach you that you must be there for your own body--you are your mind and body's est friend.
4,Interesting,This is a very difficult book to read but is very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who has anger issues that they want to deal with.
3,It's a place to start,"Don't get angry about being angry. If you read this book and still feel angry, don't dispare: Observe the elements of your anger. Spend your time observing rather than reacting. See what happens."
5,A must read,I just happened to come across the book soft cover in the airport and it was just what I needed to read...I have been needing to deal with anger in myself and this has helped me see things in a new light. He totally makes sense at pointing out where anger is ingested from...not only the food we put in our bodies but the things we watch..etc...and to take care of our anger like a baby instead of denying it...And esp. the part about writing a heart sutra...writing a love letter or a letter of gratitude and pulling it out when we are in anger and remembering that we can come back to ourselves...Anger is something not to be pushed aside but to be taken care of as we would take care of a sick baby...mindful breathing and walking are practices I am working on...This book is a keeper.
1,Angry about this book,This book is not worth the money. I was thinking this book would give me some great ways to deal with past anger issues or help with future ones. No. It is ridiculous and most of the book is dedicated to couples who have anger issues. Im single... doesn't help one bit. Wish i had not purchased.
3,Good Book BUT......................,"This is a decent book but im my opinion he pushes buddhism too much I believe that we should be assertive as men and this book trys to make you as docile as a buddist monk which in a savage society is not good. Other than that the book is great it tells you basically what you need to do to overcome the anger or anxiety you might have, its just up to you to do it."
2,East does not meet west...,"Thich Nhat Hanh's simplistic approaches work well...initially. Then, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work.I have found his techniques dangerously simplistic at times, feeling drawn to a sense of failure for not wiping my anger away after reading his book.I take it all with a grain of salt.Thich Nhat Hanh once wrote: ""I know if a person does not make people around him happy, he cannot be happy himself. And this applies not only to monks. If you are unable to make the people around you happy, how can you be happy?"" (from a talk given to children on July 23, 1997 in Plum Village)That's dangerous codependent teaching, in my view.I take from his writings what works, and drop the rest without reservation...but with careful discrimination."
2,"Hate to say it, but this book made me angry","The first few chapters were ok, but later on this book made me angry!At one point, the guy tells you that eating angry chicken makes you angry. So you have to eat either non-angry chickens, or only vegtables, because evidently vegtables don't get angry.Phooy. Hogwash! I don't belive anger has anything to do with that. Sounds like a bunch of new age hippyness or something.Anyway, I've not read past that party cause I got so angry I threw the book down. I'll read some more later, hopefully it gets better. The first chapters are ok, maybe after this part it is ok again."
4,Always worthwhile,"This book is an opportunity for insights into your experience withanger and how it can run your life, if you let it. I find this authorvery easy to read and have always enjoyed his books, especially aboutMindfulness. To be mindfull about anger, to me, is a way to feel theenergy and then let it go."
2,not as expected,"This book is advertised as good for food allergic dogs. The top allergen for dogs is wheat. The main ingredient in most of the recipes is whole wheat flour. Unfortunately, not helpful to someone with a food allergic dog."
2,Disappointing for me and for our dog!,"We occasionally like to make homemade treats for our dog. However, the recipes in this book were hard to make and the few we tried didn't turn out very well. Our dog did not eat the treats that we made, either, and he has loved treats that we have made from other sources. Luckily, this book was inexpensive since we won't be trying any more of these recipes."
5,Great cable!,"Great cable. Used to distribute the audio from my dvd player to mey Sony receiver, and works great. Highly recommended."
5,Very Sturdy Cable!!,"I bought this for a surround sound system that needed a coaxial cable and this cable fit the bill quite well! Its a thick, sturdy built cable, and a great deal for the money!"
4,Well built cable - modest hifis and home cinema set-ups won't reveal any nasty surprises,"Using this in an Onkyo based home theater system with Onkyo TV-NR717 receiver, Onkyo BD-809 bluray, Panasonic plasma TV and Klipsch Reference 42 speakers. This set up showed no hidden nastiness in the cable which does its job as I expected it to. I'm not able to comment on how well, or not, it might work with a high end stereo system, as I don't have one right now. However, I see no point in spending more money on a cable for a modest to mid range home theater setup, and the construction quality alone deserves a recommendation."
4,Works as advertised,"I've used this cable with a handful of devices and it works exactly as it should. It's affordable, well made and it works. What else do you need?"
1,Junk!,"This cable appears to be of good quality. However, when I tried to plug it in, the connectors were very tight. I think before the connectors are plated they probably fit well. But after plating it adds some thickness causing the connector to be very snug. I decided not to use it at the risk of damaging my equipment."
3,excellent product... too short!,"This is an excellent coax cable, i use to connect my dvd-hometeather, only thing that's too short... i recommend to Belkin to make at least a 6 foot cable!"
4,Inspired Facetiousness,"MYSTERY MILE is one of Margery Allingham's earliest efforts in the ""Mr. Campion"" series, and has everything the lover of the British Mystery adores: dark secrets, evil-doers, treachery, derring-do, and an insouciant protagonist, whose true identity is never actually revealed. (We know from infrequent hints that he is, if not related to British Royalty, at least an aristocrat.)I recommend MYSTERY MILE unreservedly. If you love Dorothy Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, and Agatha Christie, you are in for a grand adventure with Mr. Campion and his ex-burglar servant, Magersfontaine Lugg. I particularly liked this book which was published by Felony/Mayhem, and I hope they publish more of Miss Allingham's work."
4,A good read!,"I enjoyed this book very much. It has an engaging plot, detective, hints of a love story, characters, and medieval-feudal English setting. The one thing I would quarrel with is: the detective Campion at first seemed just to observe what happens instead of protecting the people he's supposed to protect. Why allow an unknown itinerant fortune-teller to come in to the house at all? Seems like asking for trouble! Otherwise, enjoyed it and look forward to reading my next Campion book!"
3,Almost great,"This is supposed to be one of the ""50 best mysteries of all times,"" but it certainly isn't one of the 50 top mysteries this mystery fan has read. It's o.k. as a story, and the writing is good, but the 1930s British argot is so thick that it got in the way of the story for me. And I found myself not really caring what happened to any of the characters. It certainly does give a flavor of the England of the 1930s, but I'm not going to give this book to a friend. I'm going to sell it to a used book store instead..."
5,Genuinely funny movie,"This movie is a classic comedy burglar caper. A collection of small time hoods gather to rob a pawn shop. Along the way, everything that could go wrong does in pretty hilarious fashion.As other reviewers have mentioned, Woody Allen's ""Small Time Crooks"" was clearly inspired by this film, so if you liked that one, you'll probably enjoy Madonna Street. I also agree with the problem with the subtitles flashing too quickly. All the more reason to try to get it on DVD - I found myself having to pause the frame just to read the subtitles. Despite this problem, this movie really is funny and enjoyable. Highly recommended."
4,So close to perfection...,"This is what a book about N.C. Wyeth's work should look like. It contains crisp and colorful reproductions and they are shown in full detail. It's only a shame they don't show enough.. Wyeth produced over 2,000 illustrations in his lifetime.. it wouldn't hurt to show more. Great buy though."
5,Great rock that knows where it's coming from and going to,"It's always good to see a band that can play the 90's sound without sounding dated. Keep manages this perfectly, melding the modern, techno-esque buzz of Collective Soul or recent Matchbox Twenty and the Southern roots-rock sound of R.E.M. or Three Doors Down. Key tracks to look out for are Back Around, Believe In Me, and Time Stood Still."
5,Clever and Sincere,"This disk stimulates and activates the left AND right brain! It's musically stunning, with an all star cast of musicians playing, and moving at the same time. And Randy as a pianist has a distinctive and impish voice that sets him aside from anyone else. Definitely a top pick!"
3,Etta James recording,"I purchased Hits I & II for a particular song I'd heard on the radio. Neither one of the albums contained the song I was looking for even though that was the title given on the radio. The music is fine, just not what I was looking for."
3,good radio....bad kit,"I love my sirius radio, i really really do. I do not listen to regular radio anymore. The setup of this radio was simple, and works well in my Tahoe. The only issue i have is the car kit has broken and i've had it less than a year. I need to replace it but i cannot locate a place to buy just the mounting kit sans radio. I had it professionally installed into my SUV so that i don't have the wires all over the place, and it looks great, and i don't experience the sound issues the others that posted here did."
2,It should have been a short film,"The film starts out promisingly: as the millennium approaches, a young man, posing as the editor of a bogus magazine, conducts interviews with various media personalities (actors, stand-up comics, models, rock bands). However, these all turn out to be confrontational meetings to expose the superficiality of modern ""culture."" These short bits are satirically on the mark and sustain the film for the first 15-20 minutes. Unfortunately, once this premise is established the film has nowhere to go. If this had been a short film it would have been brilliant, but stretched out to feature length, interest peters out quickly."
4,good album,"I don't think this album is as good as Smash, but it's still a damn good follow-up. My favorite song on the album is I Choose, but I like every song on the CD. If you liked Smash, get this."
5,Another sucess from offspring!,"Man,this cd is the offspring's best!Look's like Dexter and the guy's just did it!It's their best cd of all the 5 album's.My favorite music is ''The meaning of life''.But,sincerely, the whole cd is very,very cool! So if your an offspring fan,be sure to buy this album!"
4,"It rocked. To all you punk fans out there, BUY IT!!","This CD rocked, it had it all. From the fast beating of ""Mota"", to the slower, and more emotional ""Gone Away"". Die hard metal fans and die hard punk fans alike should enjoy this masterpeice. Wonderful, just pure genious."
4,Kick hiny offspring,"The offspring definitely have a lot of talent. This album, with the exeption of the disclaimer and intermission, is great. ""Cool to hate"" perfectly discribes the type of person we see so much these days, and ""I choose"" is nothing short of brilliant. If you're an offspring fan, espeially if you liked americana, get this CD."
2,could've been better,"To put it honestly, it isn't as great as the other reviews make it out to be. Its a great alternative album and representative of the ""new"" offspring. but definately not punk. except maybe 2 songs. anyway, its nice, but americana is better. at least of the same genre i mean. if u liked smash as punk, u'll be dissapointed"
2,The beginning of the end,"Sure, the musical stylings may be varied, but the variety on this album can never make up for the fact that the Offspring became soft on this release, and failed to regain their edge seen during their ""Smash"" days and before....Pity"
2,A great voice wasted on hate,"Dexter Holland has a great voice and a nice look, but he wastes it all on hate! If he were lovely and liked BSB, he'd be Jeremy Jordan - Dex and JJ have similar voices and looks but completely opposite attitudes. JJ has put out the best and loveliest album ever (Try My Love) in 1993, but Dex has the worst song ever in Cool To Hate. It's nothing more than a great voice wasted on hate!"
4,Smash is the best CD,This is a really great CD although I have never heard ignition and the offspring I think Smash is the best. Ixnay on the hombre is better then Americana by far. If you want my opinion by smash and then ixnay. OFFSPRING IS THE BEST BAND EVER!
4,"A great ""half-and-half"" cd.","'Ixnay on the Hombre' is one of those albums with some REALLY good tracks and some REALLY bad ones. For example: ""Gone Away"" has got to be one of the most intense songs I've ever heard; same goes for ""Amazed"" (as well as about 5 others). Then, songs like ""Cool to Hate"" and ""Don't Pick it Up"" throw any intelligent-themes out of whack.MOST of the songs on this album are intense, well-thought out, and musically amazing... there are just a few bad ones to skip through.Go ahead and buy 'Ixnay on the Hombre', there is some hardcore punk-rock on there... just be prepared to skip about half of the tracks."
5,The Best Album they ever did before Americana,"This album has to be the best Offspring album ever. Even though Smash is good, Ixnay On The Hombre is the best. It's got songs that when I feel down, they cheer me right up,man. The five songs I think that are the best on this album is The Meaning Of Life, All I Want, Way Down The Line, and Gone Away. I highly recommended this to anybody who wants to listen to The Offspring for the first time."
4,not their best but still great,"this album has its high points and its lows. it starts great with a cool intro and my favorite song on the album ""the meaning of life"" but the 4 songs following it really need to grow on you and even then they arent that great. the two singles ""gone away"" and ""all i want"" are great of course but you could just get the greatest hits. the only real reason to get this is for ""meaning of life"" ""amazed"" ""way down the line"" ""dont pick it up"" and the intermission is funny. it just seems like they were trying too hard to make another Smash. i would definately recommend it over their self titled album and conspiracy of one. so if you own ignition, smash, americana & splinter pick this one up"
5,Acojonantie !!!,"Kotxean hau entzuten joatea, sudurretik edozer sartzea baino subidoi handiagoa ematen dizu. Nire ustez, talde honek atera duen diskarik onena (Smash-arekin batera)"
4,Brilliant,"Great Album, one of the best albums I know of. Offspring's unique sound and high energy blast from the first song to the last. great band, great album, competes with Smash for offsprings best album."
5,"Just as good as ""smash""","I like this cd just as much as ""smash"", but not better. Smash had some great songs ""Nitro"" ""Genocide"", ""Self-Esteem"" and lots of others that I can't think of. And ""Ixnay..."" has ""the meaning of like"" ""Gone away"" and ""Change the World"""
5,awesome offspring album!,"this has got to one of the offspring's best CDs, next to smash, and ignition! some of the songs like: ""me & my old lady"", ""mota"", ""cool to hate"", and ""don't pick it up"", are kind of wierd, but the other songs are awesome! some of the best include: ""the meaning of life"", ""gone away"", ""i choose"", ""amazed"", ""all i want"", ""change the world"", and just all the other songs that i didn't say was weird. the intro song is awesome, because it's spoken by jello biafra - and dead kennedys are like one of my favorite bands - so that's a huge plus! i think this is like more of an expiremental re-make of smash, and i'm just glad they didn't over do it, they just did it right. so anyways, if you're new to the offspring, you might wanna start with smash, or ignition, so you can get a better taste of their true sound. but if you already know who the offspring is - get this now!"
5,Best CD ever!,"OK I had never heard of the offspring before, intil my friend mentioed them, he had a this cd and when I heard it I had to buy it so i ran out and bought it this is what i think.Disclaimer-funny, very well done.The Meaning of life- one of my favorite songs I love the beat.Mota- not my favorite but a nice drum solo.Me and my old lady- kind of an egyption style nice soundCool to hate- one of the best songs about hating everyone in school.Leave it behind- its okGone away- my 5th favorite songI choose- my favorite song everIntermission- chessey elevator music in the middle of a punk cd, nice.All I want- my 3rd favortie songway down the line- my 2nd favorite song, about growing up like your parentsdont pick it up- its alrightamazed- I love the beatChange the world-my 4th favorite song, about how the world is screwy.so in my opinion this is one of my favorite albums there isn't one song I would skip, exept for mota..."
5,Bitchin,I am a hardcore Offspring fan. I started out by buying Americana just because I liked some of the songs. Then I got addicted. I thought nothing could possibly be better than Smash. And I was right. But Ixnay is just as good. Cool to Hate and I Choose have awesome beats. But the best song on there by far is...Intermission!
5,Fixes everything,"This stuff draws splinters, softens rough feet, helps wounds heal fast, soothes exzema. I use it on my pets when they come home after a fight and they heal up quickly. I use it on myself, and kids too. It is not just for horses! Sticky and smelly, but it really is great to have around. I keep a 2 oz jar in my car."
1,Do not buy for Diaper Rash,The formula has changed as of Feb 2011-- my original review recommended the product but now it's no longer good for the baby!Is now 30% lanolin (original had 50%)Now also contains Disodium EDTA (original did not have this chemical)You decide. My preliminary research indicates that Disodium EDTA is no good for babies!!!!!!!
5,"Good taste and mix of proteins, mixes well","This is by far my favorite powder, I haven't tried a lot (others are Optimum and Isopure Zero Carb). As far as low carb powders go, for the Chocolate flavor is the best tasting by miles to my palate. The vanilla is good, though I have never liked the taste of strawberry powders from any brands, including this one.Over all I am very happy with it and will continue using it. Wish it was cheaper though."
5,Cheaper at fisher-pricestore.com,This toy is sold for 25.00 at fisher-pricestore.com! I was shocked it was actually more at Amazon.com!
4,Just a blast!,"This is really a great goal for younger ones! I got this for my 4 year old's birthday and he LOVES it! I read previous reviews and just let my son use our soccor ball, I didn't even blow up the little one that comes with it. The price is a good price for the goal alone, so the ball was not important to me. The only thing I don't care for is the sound maker on easy is so sensitive the wind can set it off. But hey... small price for the fun my son has! His 1 1/2 year old brother even joins in on the fun. This was very easy to put together and seems to be holding up great. I highly reccommend this to anyone with little ones who love to be outside!"
5,Follow the instructions step by step,I had to take the sides off and redo it in order to add the screws because I put the net on too soon.Very cute. Ball is 6 inches in diameter which is ok for a 2 year old. Haven't actually used it yet to know about the sounds.
4,Great Soccer Goal Net!,"I ordered this soccer goal net for my granddaughter for her 5th birthday. She is very much into soccer this year. At first she wasn't sure if it was meant to be a boy's present, since it had a picture of a boy on the box, and was very disappointed and let down when she opened the present. Once we explained that it could be for a girl as well, and set it up in the yard, she had a great time using it and loved the fact that it would yell ""GOAL"" when she hit the target on it. Would highly recommend it! It was delivered promptly too."
1,What's going on with this price???,$59.99? Isn't this the same item that was selling for $19.99 just last week on Amazon? And Super Sounds Soccer is listed on the Fisher-Price website for $25.00. What's going on here?!
2,Very Frustrating,"I found this toy to be very frustrating. I took the time to set it all up one day and my son had only played with it a little while before it all came apart again. I could not face putting back together again that day so I put it away. The next time I set it up I actually duct-tapped the tubes together in the hopes that it would remain set up longer. I was wrong. I just recently threw it out after trying again to set it up and losing my patience. I'd rather buy something that is permantly together even if it takes up more room in my garage! For right now, I am just using some orange cones as a goal and it works just as well-I can certainly shout ""goal"" on my own without the taregt."
4,Could be so much better,"The frame is metal and seems pretty sturdy, the net is ok but wish they would have made it so that it would be further back like a real soccer net. The sound thing is very sensitive and plastic but does give my preschooler a reason to keep on kicking the ball into the net. I think he has more fun playing soccer with the dog (the dog is happy too). I do like the fact that it's sturdy but light enough to play on the back porch when the weather isn't nice enough for outside."
3,OK but could be better,"This toy serves its purpose as a good starting soccer net for a toddler. It makes a fun goooooooaaaaallll sound when they score which encourages them to use it. The assembly instructions however are unnecessarily complicated and the ball they include is an absolute joke, they might as well have not included one at all. If you buy this toy make sure you buy a real soccer ball as well. The one included with the set is tiny and just makes it too difficult to score. Your child will learn nothing from using a cheap miniature ball. Also don't pay over $25 for this, I've seen it on sale as low as $18. It's not worth much more than that."
1,Less expensive at another site,"The other reviewer was right, Fisher price is selling them for $25.00! We got ours there, always reminds me to take an extra minute online to check other store websites!"
2,soccer sad,"we got this for my son's 3rd birthday. it was SO hard to put together that my husband and i (who both have master's degrees!) had to try a few different times before it worked. it is very small and tips over easily. my son just likes to kick the sound thing that hangs down. if he kicks the ball and it gets any ""air"" then it flies over the top of the goal."
4,okay,Not the easiest to put together but my 2 yr old son loves it! Buy another soccor ball bc this was it cheap.
3,Enjoyable easy read,"In 1875, approximately forty years after the Mexican War, there is a lawless land in Southwest Texas called the Nueces Strip, a stretch of hot dry land between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River filled with horse thieves and lawless bushwhackers. Determined but unhealthy Captain L. H. McNelly of the Texas Rangers, a Confederate veteran, is brought to the area to keep the peace, no matter what it takes. The strip is claimed by Texans by virtue of treaty (the spoils of war) but also by the Mexicans by virtue of history - they had been there for generations. Lanham Neal, our hero, works at the ranch of Griffin Daingerfield and his daughter Zoe. While away with Zoe herding cattle, Mexican guerillas crossed the border, killed Griffin and burned down the ranch buildings. Zoe wants revenge but Lanham sees it differently and eventually Captain McNelly has a say in matters. It was a fun read but not as memorable as some of Kelton's other books."
4,Great classic,"Not my very favorite Fairport Convention CD, but I do like it. It has some very fun songs."
3,Amusing observations on a lamentable state of affairs,"I enjoyed reading this book although I was a bit disappointed, not because it was unamusing, but because it was a bit chaotic. Truss, like the good comedienne that she is, took on a subject that most definitely touches the majority of urban dwellers and pointed out with great hilarity the utter frustration one experiences when crossing the paths of others, especially in Britain, but everywhere besides, it seems, France. Her examples are well chosen, but one gets the sense that she wrote this book as she went along, not knowing exactly where she'd end up, or if everything she'd write would relate to the topic. That said, the writing is clever and the book brief enough to be gobbled up in a couple of hours."
1,Don't waste your money,If you want to read this book please use a library and then you won't kick yourself for wasting money.
2,Painfully long drawn,"Lynne Truss drags what could have fit in a column or two in her newspaper into a book that is more tedious to read than entertaining. She does make some good points along the way with decent examples, but after waiting for weeks in anticipation to read this book, I couldn't wait to put this book down."
5,...to the death of rudeness!,"Since ""Eats, Shoots, and Leaves"" made me laugh, made me angry, and made me a warrior against bad punctuation, I was pretty certain this next book would be a pleasure. There are not as many laughs in this one, but the sense of indignation at generally bad interpersonal relationships comes through loud and clear. You will never walk through a door being held for you without saying ""Thanks."" It's a ""must read"" for Truss fans, as well as a terrific introduction to her fluent, readable writing style. It's like having a conversation with a trusted friend."
1,Totally insensitive about other's diseases,"About this at page 5 of the book:"""" I now can't abide many, many things, and am actually always on the lookout for more things to find completely unacceptable. Whenever I hear of someone being 'gluten intolerant' or 'lactose intolerant', for example, I feel I've been missing out. I want to be gluten intolerant too. I mean, how much longer do we have to put up with that gluten crap?"" ""I wish the author will have the opportunity to learn about celiac disease and gluten intolerance.If everybody thought as her, we would be related in our houses for the rest of our lifes.Disgusted."
2,One Long Rant,"Who among us hasn't noticed that the twenty-first century human seems to have become more insulated, self-involved and less mindful of others? I had hoped that Lynn Truss would offer some humorous observations on this subject, along with a few tongue-in-cheek ways to deal, and possibly a bit of insight or thought as to why things are the way they are.Instead, what she offers is a lot of whining about personal affronts and petty annoyances. To her credit, her writing style is extremely witty and I DID find myself laughing out loud while reading some of the passages. But overall, I felt like I was listening in on her griping at some friends over afternoon tea.""Talk to the Hand"" brings to the forefront how impersonal, impolite and intolerrant we've all become. But there's not much point in raising awareness about something which we're already aware.I was looking for some more substance, Ms. Truss. And you just told me to talk to the hand.(Come on...you saw that coming...)"
1,Short but not Sweet,"It looks like Ms. Truss had trouble coming up with a topic after the success of Eats, Shoots & Leaves. Perhaps she felt her first effort was well received because of her pedantic anger over poor punctuation and sought out some other topic to vent about. But, sadly, her complaints about manners are excessive - but not in a cute way. Her reasoning is uninspired and seems to rely heavily on cliche. Perhaps, though, people who wish to physically injure those who walk through doors held open for them would enjoy it. Personally I expect people to walk through when I hold open a door - it's when they don't, or stop to argue over who goes first, that I get annoyed. But physical violence never crosses my mind."
1,Bloody Rudeness is RIGHT,"This book is the ultimate in rudeness. Ms. Truss seems to define certain medical conditions ( gluten intolerance) as being boring/ rude. Perhaps Ms Truss would feel differently if she suffered from celiac disease ( an autoimmune genetic disorder)in which certain glutens must be restricted . I guess it would be less boring for her if the celiacs of the world ate the gluten and developed a cancer of the gut .Or maybe it would be less boring and rude if she was the mother of a child who had died or almost died due to the ingestion of a gluten . There will be those who enjoy the lack of sensitivity that she portrays --- but as for me I would rather exist in the "" bloody rude world"" we live in than endure her rudeness and read any more of her books"
1,This author is also rude,"This author is intolerant and ill informed at times. She makes extremely insensitive remarks about people with gluten intolerance, or celiac disease. Many members of my family have suffered greatly from the disease that Ms Truss so cuttingly mocks in this book.But - if she sees the world as rude - it is not surprising that she herself also manifests rudeness - for apparently she is fascinated with it.But really - she's trying to be funny - but at the expense of others. Normally this is something we try to correct in kindergarten - ""Don't mock the afflicted...""It is a rare humorist indeed who can bring a laugh without first stabbing at someone else. I hope Ms Truss can refine her style of writing and begin to create humor that is not so mean spirited."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Trying to finish it is actually painfull. She drolls on and on, neither being witty nor humerous. As a society we may have bad manners, but it was in equally bad taste for anyone to publish this."
1,Cognitive Behavior Therapy seems indicated for her,""" I now can't abide many, many things, and am actually always on the lookoutfor more things to find completely unacceptable.""Why MUST the world be perfect? The idea of bolting the door if it isn't, well, that's perfectly ridiculous, and her suggestions for coping are actually painful. She takes herself way too seriously, and her suggestions are a breeding ground for faulty thinking -- a recipe for really going nuts. Moreover, concerned with rudeness, she is being rude herself, inflicting the very pain she is complaining about on others."
1,EVEN 1 STAR IS TOO MUCH!,"How unfortunate it is that this woman has chose the ill fate of some to boost her books sales. If I were as evil as she, I would wish Gluten Intolerance on her, or one of the many additional maladys that can occur to those who suffer from this disability. Or worse yet that she have a child or grandchild who doesn't understand why they can't eat the same birthday cake at their friends birthday parties. But why would I stoop so low as she? Perhaps her gluten-phobia will in fact do her in by the flood gates being opened by those she has offended and public awareness of this DISEASE will be far reaching. Thank you in advance Ms. Truss if more people are made aware of this ""gluten crap"" since your book was published...it could in fact save someone's life."
1,The author needs to follow what she says...,"The authos like someone has said earlier is a good observe of human behavior and practices. Each time she re-enforces the idea that people are extremely impolite about things... I just wonder if she herself does follow it. There is no notion of not ranting about one thing over and over again. This is ""effing"" joke for the intellectual mind. To summarize the author actually is very good with english, in that she creates an entire book out a material that is worth about a page and a half at its very best.This book as per me is a pointless cluster of words and nothing more."
3,Starts well and fades fast,"The premise is solid and many points are well made. The book starts well and included several early ""belly-laughing"" points. However, the book fades into pointlessness after about mid-way. It is possible that much of the second half of the book would be more interesting to a ""Brit."" This general topic has such great potential. I am only disappointed that the author did not put more effort into the project. A person could do a whole series of books of global rudeness."
1,talk to the back of my head,"I did not like this book. I thought I would read a funny satirical book, however, the author is having an affair with a thesauras making the book long winded and definitely not funn."
1,HOW DID THIS GET PUBLISHED??!!,"I read this book about half way through. It's very misleading. All this really is about is a big book of pet peeves.To make a long and unecessary story short, Miss Truss can talk to my middle finger and see if it talks back. That's about how much respect I have for her opinion and this book.I'm sure I'll hear some crap about my response but as boring as this book was, I really don't care.Melanie"
1,HOW DARE YOU,"On page 5 of ""Talk to the Hand,"" Lynne Truss writes: ""I now can't abide many, many things, and am actually always on the lookout for more things to find completely unacceptable. Whenever I hear of someone being 'gluten intolerant' or 'lactose intolerant', for example, I feel I've been missing out. I want to be gluten intolerant too. I mean, how much longer do we have to put up with that gluten crap?""Gluten intolerance better known as coeliac disease is a medical condition and not a 'FOOD FAD' as the author suggests.If she wants to go through something like the horrors those of us who are celiac go through I suggest she takes a packet of laxatives with every meal she eats for a month and then lets the world know how she feels."
1,"Educate yourself, Ms. Truss. You should print an apology here.",Shame on you for putting people with gluten intolerance in a book about rudeness! Rest assured that those of us with the disease try not to impose our dietary restrictions on others. We just have to make sure our food is safe to eat so we don't die an early death.
1,Brits-0 !!!,"Now I remember why we don't speak with a British accent. Even discounting the fact that I am Irish and don't like the uppity brits - this book stinks. I am sure that Lynne Truss sat with a thesaurus at her elbow and tried to be ""extra"" uppity so the Americans would buy this book. No one uses six 20 letter words in every sentence. Some of the points of rudeness are accurate but you spit and fume at her own rudeness while reading. If you have a bird - buy this book to line the cage. Oherwise, go watch clothes spin at the laundromat before purchasing."
3,Too English is RUDE,"Talk To The Hand is filled with too many "" Britishisms "" and seems unedited for a non- English audience. While witty and at times quite funny, it is a bit repetitive and all in all not up to "" Eats , Shoots and Leaves """
1,A rude look at life,This woman should not be given the honor of being allowed to publish. Her stuff is trash. I wish she would stop trying to push her ideas off on others. She is totally intolerant.
1,Ms. Truss is the rudest one of all,"The Utter Bloody Rudest thing of all in this book is Ms. Truss and her ignorant bigotry on gluten intolerance, i.e. celiac disease. Guess what, Ms. Truss? 3 million Americans, and a little over 1% of Britons are genetically gluten-intolerant (and probably similar percentages for the rest of the world), and this life-damaging disease KILLS an unknown number of people each year. So you don't like dealing with gluten intolerance? We don't either, but we don't have a choice. Get over yourself, and quit slinging gratuitous insults at people dealing with serious medical issues."
1,Talk about rude behavior!,"I am truly offended by the author's comment on lactose and gluten intolerance. People do not choose to live this way. She should do some research before making such comments. As far as her feeling like she is ""missing out,"" I don't know many people who want to feel what it is like to be so sick that you don't want to get out of bed all because of something you ate. And who wants to pay 5 times as much for bread that doesn't even taste good. I have no respect for her and it doesn't say much for the publishers of this book either. I would never purchase or read any of her books!"
1,"Talk to the ""Gluten Free Group""","You have got to be kidding! In what world is it polite to say:Whenever I hear of someone being 'gluten intolerant'or 'lactose intolerant', for example, I feel I've been missing out. I want to be gluten intolerant too. I mean, how much longer do we have to put up with that gluten crap?""This book is crap!"
4,Played well this side of the Atlantic too,"Though Ms. Truss writes from the point of view of the Brit she is, I found her perspective on the state of manners in at least the industrialized, ""civilized"" Western societies to be quite accurate, at least from my observations of the world around me. Her presentation is very witty but at the same time quite succinct. Along the way some of her observations and descriptions were very much worthy of a good laugh. No regrets reading this one."
3,"Not as enjoyable a read as I'd hoped, but I agree with her rant","There is no question that Truss is spot-on in her rant about the societal decay of manners. I don't think anyone would dispute that. This book is basically a long rant peppered with this-and-that example, personal and otherwise. Problem is, it doesn't really make for captivating reading, even if you nod your head and agree with everything she is writing.So what can be done about this downward spiral in manners, etiquette, and simple decency? Probably nothing. For every parent raising their child(ren) to be decent and well-mannered folks, there are countless others who don't try as hard. The numbers will tell the tale. The rude will outpace and outbreed the well-mannered, and there's eff all we can do about it.Bolt the door."
3,"Not bad, but not the best either...","I did enjoy this book, though I didn't find it anywhere near as good as Eats, Shoots and Leaves. What I liked about Eats, Shoots and Leaves was that it was informative as well as funny, and it does seem that rants against a misplaced apostrophe are funnier than rants against rudeness. Still, I found this book to be relatively witty, even though it didn't tell me much I didn't know. I will definitely be reading any other humorous books she publishes."
1,"Banal, short, pedantic, and no fun at all!","The author does not wish to appear a prig, so allows that some latitude for a range of behaviors is acceptable. But some public behaviors simply peeve her. The author comes across as a sloppy person more personally offended than socially aware. One is given no sound view of the Commons, and trenchant analysis of changes in modern society is really lacking. The result is thin gruel.The type is large, the pages small, this very short and very thin book seems rushed to print. Unlike Miss Manners, this author offers no corrective insights, systematic social criticism, or any real depth of thought.And worse, it is a bit of a bore. Examples of bad behavior are not funny or illuminating. At best this book offers a few chuckles. It was so easy to put down, I had to struggle to finish! The writer is self-indulgent, and one feels, simply is fulfilling a book contract.Look elsewhere. And so sorry if this review seems rude..."
3,A Poor Successor,"I absolutely loved Lynne Truss' Eats Shoots and Leaves, but this slim book on rudeness is not nearly as funny or well thought out as her first. It seems as though she wrote this one with an eye on duplicating her original success; unfortunately, it did not work. Rather than read this, I suggest you reread Eats instead."
2,Major Disappointment,"I was at the airport the other day, just about to board an 8-hour flight to Europe and having liked ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves"", I thought this would be an easy to read and entertaining book for the trip. Now, I rarely quit a book before finishing it, and when I do, I at least put it away thinking I may give it another try at a later point in time. This one, I did not get further than the midpoint and I just left it in the airplane when we landed. Truss has moments when she is funny, and individual sections are quite good, but the book as a whole lacks structure and continuity. She should go back to writing columns, which is probably the length she manages to focus on a theme and bring it to a close. I felt like listening to babble from someone in a bar, complaining about the world and randomly jumping from one subject to the other."
5,Helen is Amazing,"Helen Baylor is one of the most talented women in music period. Her voice is very beautiful and unique. I would compare it to Anita Baker, but grittier. I've been a fan of hers since I was 6 years old. She definitely doesnt get the credit she deserves. This album is worth every penny. Great message, great voice! Just Excellent!"
2,What is this?,I have so many challenges in my life. Why does putting a water bottle on a bike have to be one of them? Its got screws. Its got brackets. I keep looking at those and the instructions. ??? Well I'll just run on down to the local Home Depot and get the latest dewalt drill. I hope it comes with drill bits. I guess I had to have a Schwinn bike. No holes are pre-drilled on my kids brand new bikes. This is so much fun just staring at this for hours!!! Much funner than riding lets say a bike or something.
2,"Nice bottle, how the heck do you install it?","I bought this bottle for my Schwinn bike, assuming it would be easy to install. Aside from the fact that it did not include any instructions, the hardware included with the bottle holder was pretty useless. I used wire ties to mount the bottle holder and it works good."
2,NO DIRECTIONS - what a waste!,I bought this yesterday - no where does it tell you how to install it - I emailed Schwinn but have not heard back - How about a little instruction for people who do not know how to put on your product - even POP TARTS have instructions!!!!!
1,Instructions please!,"This is a great water bottle for carrying around, but Schwinn doesn't do much to help you install it on your bike. I've called and emailed, but the company doesn't return emails and does not offer online instructions for installation. Try another product- if only for the instructions!"
1,Worst Design Ever,"I bought my Schwinn bottle and cage at a local retail store. It did have minimal and somewhat ambiguous instructions. Come to find out, you have to have a Schwinn bicycle to use their bottle cage. That is totally ignorant. I assume they did this for ease of installation. However, they are losing sales of Schwinn accessories to non-Schwinn owners, not to mention losing money on the product returns which can't be resold.If they made a universally installable bottle cage, or at least an adaptor for other bikes, that would make a little sense. Having Schwinn accessories on non-Schwinn bikes is advertising in and of itself. The current design only creates ill-will among non-Schwinn owners. Nobody is going to go out and buy a Schwinn bicycle because the water bottle cage they just bought won't install on their bike."
2,"Well, it looks like a nice bottle.","Schwinn does not include any instructions for installing it, and since I was not born knowing how to install bicycle water bottle cages... I could not find a phone number on thier site, so I emailed. I have not heard back from them. I sure would like to get this taken care of before my trip!I guess I just spent $8 for nothing."
2,Someone please buy this protagonist a spine.,"I would have enjoyed this book much more if the main character showed any inclination towards standing up for herself or making her own decisions. Unfortunately, so much of contemporary ""women's fiction"" seems to center on ditzy, semicompetent (at best) heroines, and this book is no exception. The back story is handled clumsily, with a lot of dialogue that would never occur in real life but which the author uses to sum up the previous books in the series."
4,Another great read from denise swanson,I enjoy all the Scumble River mysteries. This one is a fun romp and follows a line of story that is not complicated yet a great read. I am waiting to see which beau wins out in the next book.
4,Bene!,"Very good! Liked it! As described! Using it for a textbook, not sure how that's going to work out. Seems a bit stuffy and wordy, but what else do you expect from medieval Latin?"
1,Learning Latin? Teaching it to Students?,"Do yourself or your students a favor and FORGET SIDWELL.This cancer on the body of Latin education has impaired and imperiled students for too long. Choose Wheelock, choose Scanlon, choose to sit down and memorize Lewis and Short, but please, please, don't keep buying this putrid and detestable mockery of a language course. If you need evidence of this man's utter madness, look to the notes in this volume, or to the glossary: of what possible assistance are notes that tell the student what she is already certain to know while remaining silent when she most needs guidance? Sidwell: the sun has set on your empire of tears; you have had your day."
4,finally someone to move us from the beancounters to mfg $,"Finally someone moves us from the bean counter mentality to how to make money in manufacturing. I thought this book was excellent, I have taken several manufacturing management course, both undergraduate and graduate level and reading this book gave me more insight to running a manufacturing facility. Everyone from the President to first line supervisors should read this book."
1,NOT A AUDIO CD as the description states,"The product states in the title it is an unabridged audio CD. Unfortunately it is 8 cassettes...going old school. The good news for me is my Camry has a cassette player, the bad news is who wants cassettes. Considering I am buying this for an MBA class, I am going to roll with the cassettes, but Amazon really should monitor this a little heavier."
2,"It may be good business, but it's TERRIBLE fiction.","I read the first version of this book because a manager of mine made me. I'm giving it two stars because it really did teach this novice to the business world a few things about manufacturing. But as a reader and lover of novels, I nearly puked. It is one of the worst excuses for a novel I've ever read, and I would have preferred that the author remained in the realm of nonfiction. Nevertheless, it did provoke one charming comment, from one of the computer geeks in the company, to all of us English majors in the technical writing division. Told by the same manager that he, too, had to read ""The Goal,"" and informed that it was by a novelist, he asked, innocently, the immortal question: ""What IS a Novell-ist?"""
3,Not effective for us,"We got this tourniquet to keep in our medical supplies in case of traumatic injury and arterial bleeding. My husband has had several EMT courses and I've had first aid training. We weren't happy with the design of this one, although the idea of a velcro closure sounded good. It's hard to get it tight enough, even with stretching the rubber part. We won't send this one back since it was only $6 including shipping - we'll keep it as a backup. Instead we bought several of the Cinch Tight and Israeli compression bandages which can be applied with one hand if you're alone and bandaging yourself."
1,Poor Service,"I was very disappointed with the service of this product (from the seller). I ordered this book on July 8th for a Graduate Class that I am taking. After shipping said it would take maximum 12 days for the shipping that I paid for, I then recieved an e-mail saying the estimated arrival date was to be July 30. Now it is August 11th and I still have yet to recieve this book. I went to Barnes and Noble to purchase the book. Class ends this week and still no book. I disputed charges through my credit card. Very disappointed in Amazon services."
1,Send this book to Bush !,"I have taught this team approach in my problem-solving classes in Bus Admin., using an exercise many others have used to demonstrate the value of the group, namely, ""Lost on the Moon"" What supplies do you take with you and the order of importance? Several teams compete against individuals, pairs,etc. In all my classes, a team of 7-9 (odd #) has done significantly better than the Individual in making the choices and explaining how the tools, and other items would best be used.In contrast read ""The Challenger Space Capsule Disaster"" to avoid the perils of Groupthink.The author's how-to, Strive for Diversity of opinion, Independence, Decentralization,and Aggrgating Opinion, were all demonstrated so well by the Kennedy Team in resolving the Cuban Missile Crisis.Bush needs to recast his ""echo chamber."" If Karl Rove would give him this book for Xmas, we would all have better New Years ahead."
3,Interesting but redundant,"The book was good and had some very interesting points. However, towards the end of the book the ideas seemed to repeat themselves and become difficult to finish"
5,Great read,I really enjoyed this book. If you are interested in social psychology at all then you might like it too. It is a longer book but I stayed interested in it the whole way through and the topics flowed nicely and were well written and explained even if you weren't familiar with the topic.
5,Down another rabbit hole!,"I have read over 1,000 business books ""at large"", and James' The Wisdom of Crowds is among the few that has made me go WOW multiple times, making sense of real life experiences and observations, extrapolations from other disciplines, other books/readings, common sense, as well as common and uncommon non-sense.Teamwork, brainstorming, committees are indeed tools, and like any other tools must be handled with care, used and not misused, and The Wisdom of Crowd is the closest to a User's Manual for anyone involved in dealing with teams of individuals; and for those who want to harness the power of crowds leveraging the internet.So, THANK YOU James, you made sense to many observations, solved quite a few puzzles and opened new questions in me."
2,Cherry picked facts can prove any theory,"The way the author organizes materials to prove his hypothesis is deeply flawed. This book mainly relies on some cherry picked facts or stories to prove its point. Facts are frequently stretched to be linked to the theme and incoherences are often ignored.What this book is trying to prove to be good is actually what the author lacks, common sense."
3,Useful survey,"A useful survey of how various groups make decisions, and the factors that can help or hinder such processes. I had hoped for more discussion on small groups that make critical decisions within a larger organization (such as the section on NASA and the Columbia mishap), but the book spends most of its time discussing markets and traffic flow."""
1,Why do the Crowds buy this book if they are so Wise?,"This book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book (this has been noted by others)Anything of interest is said in the first chapter, followed by a lot of fluff - ""sometimes the crowd is wise"" ""sometimes the crowd is not wise"". After the first chapter, I seriously couldn't read for more than 10 minutes without getting bored."
4,What happens during Stampede and Rampage,"This is one great book and very intelligently written material. The classification is superb that helped me improve me understand another aspect of Social Science. Basically, I am Online Marketing expert who is new to the domain of Social Media. While doing my research about the psychology about Collective Intelligence (the term that my boss use to coin a lot many times), I came across this book.One point that I think is not covered in the book is the response of the crowds during the Soccer matches, what happens during that time, what psychology is involved, why are rampage caused. Is that something out of scope. Well I don't think so.Further, how are critical situations lead to stampede that involves crowds. There should have been some discussions about those aspects as well.Otherwise, the material has helped me enhance my knowledge a lot. Thanks"
4,Great read if you're looking for a book of this genre,"The book is based around what I thought was a very unique and interesting thesis (see the title)--and much of the text is an exercise which delves into analysis of various forms of evidence used to support it. Some of the evidence was stronger than other pieces in my opinion.Within the same genre, I personally like Malcolm Gladwell a little bit better--especially as a writer. However, that takes nothing away from my opinion of Surowiecki as a brilliant thinker."
1,Hard read - should have been a 50 page book,"I hate to bash an author - but this book was torture to finish. It tries to follow the format of blink, tipping point and freakonmics - interesting stories to illustrate a point, however the author doesn't make many interesting statements. I came away feeling that the author was forced to finish a school paper on a topic- After the third explanation of how the average gets a better result, I got his point."
2,"Fascinating Concept, Boring Book","Two heads are better than one. And a hundred heads are even better. And a thousand are almost perfect. Watch the asymptote as it approaches infinity... You are getting veeeerrrry sleeeeepy...This is a very interesting concept, fleshed out into a very boring book. It seems like a graduate thesis that got stretched to book length for publication in hopes of drafting the popular slipstream of writers such as Malcolm Gladwell.The premise is fascinating, and the first chapter delivers. After that it reminds me of papers I wrote in high school, where I'd state a proposition and then strip-mine all available research materials in a singleminded quest for [only] supoorting information. It feels very one-sided.Overall, as I'm sure you can tell, I found it a bit of a disappointment because it could have been a very enjoyable article or even a book if it wasn't so heavy-handed in pursuing the thesis's applicability to every aspect of human endeavor."
2,"Tedious, shallow and meandering","Interesting premise; tedious, shallow and meandering execution. Surowiecki explores a number of promising leads but doesn't really close the deal on any of them. Too many anecdotes and related conclusions are left as fiat, without real exploration, exposition or more importantly credible documentation that the author's conclusions are merited by the studies he cites. Worse, every conclusion is promptly followed by a laundry list of caveats and counter-cases. Since the author does not truly develop an organizing theory or tightly woven explanatory narrative (leaving his only attempt to do so until literally the last several pages), the reader ends up being subjected to a barrage of interesting, but often contradictory, just-so stories. The end result is more frustrating than enjoyable or enriching."
2,Little more than a collection of anecdotes,"Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new ""web 2.0"" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis. From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument. The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance. I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir."
2,"High expectations, yet disappointing","I was excited to read Wisdom of Crowds feeling that it would present some unique ideas, however, was disappointed in the presentation and the lack of supporting evidence for some concepts. An alternative to ""wisdom of crowds"" in my opinion is the knowledge of crowds vs. the wisdom of the few."
2,Bad Implications....,"The last thing America needs right now is a mindset that supports the 'crowd' to make our minds up for us. How did that work in 2008-9 stock market crash and housing bubble? In Surowiecki's view, the crowds are right, and we should believe them over any 'bright guy' with a great idea.The Swedes have a word for this - 'lagom', which means 'good enough'. The U.S. economy wasn't built upon 'lagom', it was built upon 'can-do', which arose from brilliant ideas.......from individuals!!! Crowd thinking may get an accurate answer, as he supports, but that's only 'lagom'.Interesting read, but concepts to support his case are cherry picked, and contorted away from logical thinking and observation of how crowds really work.The Death of Management: Restoring Value to the U.S. Economy"
2,"No Works Cited, No Index, and 2 Dubious ""Facts"" by Page 35","""Facts"" presented without references to back them up are questionable. No index makes going back to check on something inconvenient. Two (IMO) erroneous ""facts"" used to support the author's position had cropped up by page 35. THE WISDOM OF CROWDS should be read with a grain of salt."
4,Food for thought,"I found this book full of sweeping claims, generalizations and is confusing in its presentation. However it made me think. Overall the writer is saying that people independently working on a problem can in a fair vote be more accurate then the smartest individual. He then quotes examples for such behaviour and examples of when the crowds got it wrong when they acted not independently but in mass. I suspect that much of his arguments are sound.How much I am not sure for example if I asked the average person independently if they believe there was much truth in astrology, I am sure that over 50% would say yes.However since the book is making much comments, I hope to see some better studies coming forward.Having said all this it has changed my views on decision making and how to do it."
3,Fact stringer,Disjointed confusing presentation of interesting fact and findings. The author is a fact finder. Collects facts that are tenuously related and strings them together. But there is no intellectual thread that binds them. Just a fact: that sometimes and under some conditions a poll of many will yield better results than even the opinion of experts. Many will find the book amusing. I was bored.
3,It's interesting,"I don't know how much of this I agree with. It's a bit like the wisdom of a swarm of bees. Yeah, they might be right for now, but. ...."
3,Next Step - Group Think from the Ministry of Truth,"The jist of the book is that if you ask enough people than the ""average"" answer is good enough when compared with the ""real"" answer. You can present all the data you want but to me the real answer is that no one can be an expert in all areas and no one is right all the time. To me the undertone of this book was to dispell the notion that an expert in the field is really such. I have found that when a decision needs to be made I can't poll 1000 people to get their input and the decision needs to made right now, right or wrong time is money. The one thing missing is - when do you hold all these people accountable who don't don't have a stake in the decision or really care about the outcome because they are not held responsible for it. Oh that's what they call government."
1,Kindle price higher than book - will buy from abebooks for $4,Kindle pricing ebook issue.I can buy from abebooks used as a real book and will do so. I will not pay more for an ebook than the real thing.
2,Pseudoscience,"I didn't finish this book, cos I thought it would be a waste of my time. I was not convinced from the first page to the last page I read. While the idea is interesting, the overly varied examples don't prove much except sloppiness. If I missed the point, then the author has obviously done a very bad job at explaining his concept. He tries to pass off aggregation, independence and one other thing as basic conditions as though there is some science involved here, but the meaning of all three are not defined, so I find them useless in understanding the examples raised. The arguments are not structured in a way that would convince a skeptical reader. Interesting idea though."
3,what about the YAHOO quiz?,"i started reading this book and was very fascinated bythe first examples. I already started to bring thissubject up during lunch talks at work.then i came across the quiz questions on yahoo whereeveryone can vote in a multiple choice way tospecific questions. after voting you can then see theanswer and how other users did vote. typically thereare about 60000 to 100000 votes. this should be enoughfor a pretty good statistics, howeverthe crowd votes VERY poorely - exremely disappointing(...)i wish the author of the wisdom could explain this orif the author does not know the answer then may beanother readerone explantion i could offer is that the people who answer the yahoo quiz have no clue about the answer and it is more or less random.Erhard"
1,Missing pages,Beware! This is a good book but there are 32 pages missing starting on page 68 rendering it almost useless! Found out too late to return.
2,Journalist Mistreats Science,"The Wisdom of Crowds is a five-star topic, but it is not treated as it might have been. James Surowiecki exchanges complexity, precision and eloquence of language and concept in the interest of mass-consumption. I suppose that is due to his training as a journalist, but I caution anyone against reading a science book not written by the people who devote themselves wholeheartedly to the science.Wisdom of Crowds is not entirely unworth reading, especially if you're looking for a light treatment of the subject and you appreciated Mitch Albom and Po Bronson's style. But if you're looking for an engaging introduction to the subject, keep looking."
1,Can I please give negative stars?,"This book has actually made me so angry in reading it that I'm having trouble writing a fair assessment of it. The authors developments for the ""wisdom of crowds"" was judged by the fact that if you average people's guesses at the numbers of marbles in a jar, it comes to be rather close; fine for guessing marbles in a jar, but real world applications of this type of thinking is flawed and arguments for it are left wanting. A good half the arguments he develops in the book are about the stupidity of crowds; leaving me wondering why I even bothered with his trite analysis of ""funny and amusing sociological data"" The author's world is a sterile and joyless place where the reality of his ideas are about as exciting as this read. The last time I checked ""crowds"" haven't written any great books, created any symphonies or inspired me to any level like an individual could."
4,James Surowiecki rediscovers markets,"There's absolutely nothing new in this book- except, perhaps, to the typical New Yorker reader who instinctively recoils at the notion that groups- or more specifically, markets- could do a better job of planning, distribution and allocation than could wise central planner. But for those readers, Surowiecki provides a good, readable story that might convince them that Smith, Mandeville, Hayek, Friedman and hundreds of other writers who understood the role of markets just might have known what they were talking about."
3,Summary book of crowd behavior,"I read this book because I wanted to stay up-to-date with trends in mass collaboration and how that is evolving with the internet. I found this book to be a good summary to be conversational with others when talking about the terms he defines such as coordination and cooperation problems. However, I found myself not doing much note taking or highlighting of passages that are relevant to my life as an IT professional."
4,Eye Opening,I thought this book was very well written and truly opens the mind to different viewpoints. A good read.
4,"A Slovenian masterpiece about Crusades-era Persia, a 1938 commentary on Mussolini's regime? Wait... stay with me...","An intriguing book that mixes Crusades-era Muslim history with surprisingly modern religious extremist ideology. Not a dry book at all - the well-written characters and snowballing plot lines result in a satisfying read. I docked it a star for several ridiculous young female characters who were rendered hopelessly silly either by translation (the original book was in Slovenian), or by design.I got this book because I read that it was part of the inspiration for the original Assassin's Creed game. The slogan of the Ismaili leadership (""Nothing is true; everything is permitted"") is used in the game, and the book mentions Masyaf, a locale also in the game. Other than those two things, the book and the game have nothing in common. The game even warps the slogan to a completely different meaning than that developed by the book."
5,Robes of Power,A very informative and well illustrated book. It will help me in the construction of of a shamanic robe for my own use.
3,The Ultimate Dimension,For me the Ultimate DImension is an interesting listening experience and it gives a nearly perfect picture of one man's practice and views of Buddhism. But it dwells too much in his interpretation of what the Buddha's sutras mean and not quite enough on quoting the sutras and letting the listener/reader distill the lessons for themselves.I would be more pleased if Hahn intermixed the Buddha's actual words with his discussions of how they can be internalized and implemented in practice but throughout the entire 6 CD collection there is little of this.If the reader/listener is intimately familiar with the Lotus Sutra and other Buddhist texts then this advanced retreat would be a perfect addition to his or her collection. But if not then it is quite like looking at the reflection of a beautiful scene and not the scene itself.One humble opinion.
4,Good but not the best in series,Ultimate Dimension is a recording of a retreat on a more advanced topic. It is interesting but I think Present Moment retreat is better. It is more basic and a better quality recording.The Present Moment: A Retreat on the Practice of Mindfulness
5,Outstanding and versatile,"Pedal Power is awesome--be sure to refer to the manual regarding current, because one of the greatest features is the variation in current at the various outputs. I run EHX Deluxe Memory Man TT 550 (which has higher current draw) at output 5. Each output is ground isolated, which is great because I use Voodoo Labs voltage doubler cables (order online) to combine two outputs and get 18V for a couple of my pedals.Refer to the manual's output chart, and you'll see that between the dip switches, various configurations of the outputs (including different amperages and a sag voltage setting for some vintage sounds on outputs 7-8), and the use of voltage and current doubling cables, you can get a ton of functionality out of this thing. Mounts perfectly (hardware included) on PedalTrain pedalboards (I use PT-2)."
2,Flimsy and small,"I bought these recently after buying a similar (more expensive) set at Sur La Table, thinking I'd found a bargain. Unfortunately, these don't compare to the more expensive set, being smaller and very flimsy. You pretty much have to use a muffin tin with these -- they just replace the paper liners, rather than allowing you to bake without a tin. The serving size is also very small, and I find that batter leaks over the edges into the tin if I'm not very careful with filling. So I end up having to wash a tin, anyway! Very disappointing."
3,3 stars for price,"Overall I am very happy with the performance of the product, My muffins come out easy, and I'm not trying to pull paper off my food. They are very easy to wash. I just think the price is too high for what they are."
4,"Kaiser Bakeware Kaiserflex Silicone Muffin Baking Cups, Set of 6","i ordered these so that i could bake chocolate lava cakes in them. they work awesome, if they were a little bit larger."
4,"So good, I bought it for my son","I was so taken with ""Memos"" as a teenager that now that I have a teenager of my own, I believe this to be an important read for him. Good, straightforward writing from a great storyteller."
5,Great Music,Love her voice and each song is better than the next. I play the CD over and over again. Was a perfect choice.
5,Great CD!!,This Cd is probably one of favorite CD's ever. It has a lot of catchy songs that are written very honestly. Great lyrics. I listen to a lot of bands and different music but this is the only CD that I am able to listen to over and over without gtting sick of it. Every song on here is really good and if you're looing for some new bands this CD is really worth buying.
5,Taking Back Sunday bound to rise,If you haven't already purchased this cd than you are a fool. Taking Back Sunday is a great band with awesome meaningful heartfelt lyrics. They really put all they have into their music. There is not one song i will skip on this CD it is that good and TBS is bound to rise and be the best and be a breakthru band that everyone will be talking about one day.
4,Taking Back Sunday....,"This is one of my favorite bands along with Further Seems Forever, but my friend introduced me to this album and its really good. The three best songs on Tell All Your Friends are Cute without the 'E', You're So Last Summer, and Timberwolves at New Jersey. Their sound and songs are quite original and if you've never heard of this band, they're actually quite good. Especially if you're branching off from mainstream bands"
3,Brand New similarites?,"This is an average albumn, it follows the usual emo path, of which I am fan. It is not the best however as it has nothing special. I would not recommend it to the casual emo listener as it may take some time to appreciate. One thing that i did notice is that there are some of the exact same lyrics as in earlier Brand New songs. I'm not sure of the reason, but I would recommend Deja Entendu by Brand New instead of Tell All Your Friends."
5,Great CD,I listen to this CD all the time!!! It really gets me going and it has enough mellow songs in it for when I want to be mellow! I love it!
4,good emo,"for all you who say this cd is whiny and girlish, well, it is EMO. duh. so if you dont like that aspect, dont whine about it on here. Anyways, TBS is a great emo band with big things in store for them, as there style is a bit different from most other bands which makes them even more unique. both singers are good, the guitars fit the music well, the drums are okay, the bass is average, but all in all the music comes together. so may make fun of you for being ""emo"", or whatever for listening to this , but i love bands like in flames (old stuff) children of bodom, arsis, killswitch, the bled, as i lay dying, unearth. god forbid, all that remains, and a score of other metal and HxC bands. so there is no shame in listening to this music. buy it, u will like."
5,Watch for TBS,"These guys are obviously in so many genres. They have some Punk elements, some hardcore and emo lyrics, some hardcore singing, and some punk singing. I wont get into detail about how people sy they're like Thursday...because I dont own any Thursday albums. Dual vocalists never sounded so good, the catchy lyrics and great instrumental make this an album to own. If you like emo, buy this album, if you like punk, buy this album, if you like hardcore, sample the album first."
2,Ugh.,"Yeah taking back sunday are actually one of the better ""screamo bands"" but screamo itself is a terrible genre of music. The album is boring, repetive and whiny. Go cut yourselfs stupid emo people."
2,Boring and Predictable,"Has anyone noticed that all the songs sound pretty much the same. I mean thats why Nolan left the band. Each song starts off slow, then leads into the chrous, and then ends with screaming. Im sorry but compared to other ""Emo"" bands Taking Back Sunday doesnt compare. Deja Entendu by Brand New is the better album and Tell All Your Friends doesnt even compare. I will be happy once TBS learns to make songs that dont song exactly the same."
1,this bands for little girls,"dont buy this album letalone any TBS album, but the point is all you little emo kids out there prolly love these guys and i hate too tell you your little girls and go back too listening too dashboard or saves the day"
3,unoriginal and moderately okay rock,"here's what's up with taking back sunday, they are an okay emo/rock band. an earlier review compared them to at the drive-in? ummm... no, not even close. at the drive-in was very much so original. this album is not worth $16.99, but if you can burn a copy or find it used then get it. and please note, the word emo is a crock of crap that has been abused. you want original emo? listen to mineral, texas is the reason, sensefield, jawbreaker, and the list goes on."
2,Ugh,"A little while ago I heard this great tune on MTV2. The song was called Cute Without the E(cut from the team) by Taking Back Sunday. Excited about this song a went a got the CD. How dissapointed I was. The album Tell all your friends fails to keep the level of excelency of Cute without the E. The CD ends up sounding the same as most of the other Emo bands of today like rufio, brand new, the movielife and the sound gets tired. i don't care what people say about this review but no one can tell me their sound is original."
3,Ummm...,"So this album was alright. Your first listen, the songs will grab you and make you have a little foot-tapping action. But listening to it further, it is a classic emo/pop dissapointment. The lyrics are a sad attempt to try to meat the emotion of the sell-outs Saves the Day... and the songs aren't half as good. A positive thing on this album would be the hard-core mix in, although that plainly seems to be a grasp for Thursday's brilliance; for those of you who think that Taking Back Sunday is a match-up to Thursday, they can't even hold a flame. They need to find some originality first.Highlights: Ghost man on Third to me is their best song, I haven't heard another punk/emo song with the same format and it really grabs at your emotions. Cute without the 'E' is also pretty good; the opening is awesome."
5,THIS CD IS AMAZING,"I would like to consider myself an avid music lover, and I must say that Taking Back Sunday is possibly the best new band to come out of this whole Pop/Punk/Emo genre. Ive seen them 3 times and going on my fourth in march and they put on a badass show everytime i see them. They are all about the fans which is something lacking in todays music scene. The guitar and bass technicality is very dissapointing but the display and setup of these songs is unreal. I honestly hope they make it huge and i hope to see them playing Continental Airline Arena one day! MAdison Square Garden??!?!"
5,A Gift From The Emo Gods,"While some of their songs may be thought of as childish they are what todays youth are going through. Personally I was taken in by Cute Without The E because it was the first song I heard on the Victory records sampler, but as I began to listen to the song more and more I realized something. That as the cd progressed you progessed with the band. As in Timberwolves at New Jersey I get tingles in the intro to that song. Its just a glorious Cd, overall. If your into pretty deep emo this is for you."
4,pretty solid album,"yeah it is pretty good but it is not the greatest, the only reason why is because most of the songs sound the same but the songs are still pretty good. the song that is perhaps the greatest and the one that everyone seems to like is, Cute Without the 'E' (Cut From the Team), and that song is great it has awesome lyrics and the vocals jump back and forth which makes it all the more wonderful. this song gets you hooked.some other good songs are:Great Romances of the 20th Century, Ghost Man on Third(pretty slow but then builds up and kind of explodes it is very good,),Timberwolves At New Jersey( very good tune here, good vocals and lyrics as well, itd be good for a next single maybe),You're So Last Summer- in my opinion, the best song here because of the great lyrics and soulful tune very well doneso you should get this cd, it is solid and pretty well done."
3,"not bad, could be better","Most of the songs are pretty good, especially #3,#6, and #7. I didn't really care for #4 and #5, and the rest were ok. They had pretty good lyrics and are very talented. Some of the songs were kind of boring and sounded the same. I would recomend it to people who really like punk rock, and like people who can actually sing. There's lots of bands out there that make good music, but can't sing very well, but TBS is an exception. Good CD, I'd give it about a 6 on of scale of 1 to 10."
3,"Okay album, for an okay band","The cd has a pretty good mix of songs, but i really just want to rate the band:Singing/Vocals: 3.5/5 - The singing is okay, at sometimes it sounds like an entoxicated backstreet boy, but overall, it caries the music pretty well.Guitar/s: 4/5 - The guitar sounds very decent, well put together and great timing, at sometimes it sounds uneven.Bass: 2.5/5 - The bassist sounds confused and out of rythm. He stays with the guitar well, but never picks up a riff with more than 3 notes.Drums: 2/5 - The worst player in the band... the drummer. He is very cymbal happy. At times he looses rytym, and goes into some last minute solo, im not sure if this is the drummers fault, or the song writers fault.OVERALL: 3.5/5 - nice emo band, i wish they'd sing about something else besides a girl"
4,damn good.. for awhile,"this cd was on the top of my list for about 2 or 3 months, but i eventually got tired of it. i still listen to it occasionaly. it has some good songs but i think some are just plain annoying now. its still worth the buy though."
1,The next eMo kId who scrawls,"""The truth, is you could slit my throat and with my one last gasping breath I'd apologize for bleeding on you shirt"" will get a toaster oven crammed in their face."
1,What About The Music,"This CD is not about musicIts about The Guy who wrote it who is just using every song to say somethingThe music itself is abysmal - However many times I listen I cannot get myself going and I cannot bring myself to like any of the songsI don't get the general obbessions with this band.I doubt any of you listen to the new wave of music talent like AFI - Cos This CD is so unlike that it makes me cringeGenerally Poor Music, And unless your a wash-up hard metal, grunger who needs some nice gental simple basic bland songs - You might like itBut not for me - Which Dissapoints me - Because I thought I would enjoy it"
1,This SUCKS PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,This is the worst band of all time. There is no question about that. The people in this band have no talent. This is the worst singing I have ever heard in my life. Please do not support this no-talent band by purchasing this CD.
1,"Talent, thou hast none",I remember dating a girl that loved this album. Thats how I knew it was over. I have day-dreams of seeing taking back sunday fans in a pit fight against Pantera fans. I highly suspect that all the male 5 star reviews come from those that have never touched a woman.
1,The next eMo kId who scrawls,"""The truth, is you could slit my throat and with my one last gasping breath I'd apologize for bleeding on you shirt"" in my yearbook will get their scrawny elbows bent the wrong way and then stuffed in an electrical socket. Thank you for your time, and may God have mercy on your pathetic soul."
5,good,"Ghost man on third is the best track on this cd. It builds up to this powerful emotional climax, and the girl's voice in the background is very haunting as it harmonizes with the main melody and vocals.You Know How I Do is very very good too.all the songs are good, but ghost man on third and you know how i do are two of the more complex and fulfilling songs.others greats of course are bike scene, cute without..., and you're so last summer"
4,a strong album,"Taking back sunday has been one of those underrated bands that people never really looked at much. but after this album, you will get a whole new definition to the term ""emo"". this album is like saves the day meets with a little bit of jimmy eat world.with strong tracks with strong lyrics such as "" The Bike Scene"" and catchy beats, such as "" Blue Channel"". Taking back sunday is bound to do well in the music industry, i certainly expect them to do well in the future and become the talk in the punk industry."
2,Average at best,"Currently, I am only really listening to either pop-punk or emo so therefore feel I have a good background on this genre of music to compare this band to. Taking Back Sunday are not a bad band...they aren't great either.I can't help but feel that the screaming parts of the songs are out of place, and put in just to try and ride some of the waves of success of Thursday. Also, the singing just doesn't seem to have the same sort of emotion as band such as Thursday, Time Spent Driving, Senses Fail or the Early November.In conclusion, I wouldn't buy this album - get either the Senses Fail or Early November EP instead...that is real emo."
1,Another Victory Records release,"Let me start by saying that Tell All Your Friends is not TBS's debut album, but then again, most mainstream poser listeners would have no idea. TBS was another average (generic) punk band until Victory Records took control, then bastardized them. TBS has nothing in common with Thursday (minus the backup vocals, which are a creation of Thursday that the producers decided to push onto this as well), the lyrics are horribly predictable and generic. The guitar work leaves much to be desired and the song structures are about as predictable as the lyrics. Oh yes, this is not ""emo-punk"", it's just straight Victory Records carp pop punk. The only thing that saves this album from getting one star is the nice artwork on the cover of the cd.er... actually, nah."
2,"It's okay, but haven't I Heard This Before?","This whole new wave of emo has really dissapointed me in terms of originality and ingenuity. Thursday, Finch, The Movielife, and Taking Back Sunday all seemingly sound...THE SAME! There is nothing by Taking Back Sunday that I haven't heard before. Heck, TBS used the same producer that Thursday did.It's the same vocals, same structure, and same lyrics. There are some stand-out tracks like ""There is no I in Team"" but even that sounds like someone has already made it.For those that would like to try something different check out Recover, New End Original, Jets to Brazil, or even Mars Volta. But if you loved Taking Back Sunday, all you have to look for is every other artist signed by Victory Records (Except Catch 22)."
2,TBS Opener,"I didn't enjoy this CD past the first couple of days. I bought the CD after hearing it in a friend's car. I listened to it for a few days and then I didn't pull it out of my case for a long time. When I pulled it out and listened to it again, I thought it was awful. The music isn't very good. The lyrics are not well written, and they're incredibly emo (just a personal preference of mine not to go too far into emo thoughts). The screaming was good at first, but then it was the same sound the whole CD, and it gave me a headache. Overall, if you want a CD with screaming on the same tone almost constantly, and below average guitar and drums, pick this up. Otherwise, avoid this CD and don't waste your money."
5,Simply the BEST!!!,"TAKING BACK SUNDAY...is simply the best band out right now!! Inspiring countless others to follow their lead with an innovated new sound. Dont be a fool! See where it all started!! I suggest buying this cd today!! Also, check out the new one due out July 27th!!! You will not be disappointed!!"
3,It's okay,"I like this CD. I really do. But it seems like they need more talent in the sense that their lyrics could be better. The music is great, but it just seems like the lyrics are a little strained. This'll happen with every band on occasion, but I could really notice it on Tell All Your Friends."
5,WOW!!!,"This band is amazing with writing songs. They're unique with the double harmonies from the two singers. But if they ever come to your town my suggestion is not to see them. I saw them and got horribly dissappointed. The music was played well but the lead singer barely sang and missed just about all of his parts, taking away the two things I love the most about TBS which are the lyrics, and complex song structures. By the CD don't see them live."
3,cheese,this doesnt compare to brand new tbs takes lyrics from brand new and brand new is awsome go buy there cd instead seriously okay bye
5,rock on!!!,"My first punk experience was Sum41, and before that I was never the least bit interested in it. Until I heard these guys. This cd kicks... I first heard them when my boyfriend, at the time, played a part of ""Timberwolves At NJ"" for me. I started listening to it more closely when he would play it on the stereo. When I bought it for myself and started listening to it, I fell in love with it. It is so amazing. The lyrics are so heart-felt and deep. Almost anyone can relate to them in some way. The vocals are incredible. They blend so well, impossible to replicate. All in all, this cd will get you head-banging, dancing around, and singing along even if you only know two words. I wake up singing the songs in my head, it's that good. So go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it."
2,you guys need to get out more,"I can't believe the reviews I've been reading for this album. ""This is the best cd I've ever heard""...please! Are you kidding me?! Even in this same genre there are so many better bands. What we have here is pretty much a emo blink-182. The vocals make me gag as they absolutely destroy the whole dual-vocals thing. I also saw a reviewer say they have ""deep, meaningful lyrics"". Hmmm, ok...and I guess you must also find the expose about the letter 3 on sesame street deeply thought provoking. I can't help but think of high school (even jr. high) when I hear this cd. ""And you're so guilty it's disgusting He's been sneakin underneath your sheets and your hands have been in places that they probably shouldn't go but don't worry sweetie cause I already know."" - That's directly from ""The Blue Channel"". Invest a little time and you'll find bands 10 times better than this."
1,While you're at it...,"Take back this cd. It sucks. Oh yeah, and tell all your friends. This one should be avoided for the good of the entire human race."
4,Great CD! Great Buy!,"This is the best CD I've bought so far! I'm in love with the song ""Cute Without the 'E'"" and ""You're So Last Summer"". This CD is the perfect blend of the stuff I'm crazy about and what real music is made of! You should definately get this CD!"
5,"7 years later, still one of my very favorite albums","So its been over 4 years since I bought this CD, and over 7 years since it came out. It is still one of my most treasured albums that I own. I can listen to it straight through without skipping a track.Thankfully, the songs are written beautifully, without the almost de facto verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus. They all have a very unique and energetic profession that tell a story.This is one of those brilliant pieces of music that manages to sound cohesive as an album, without all the songs sounding the same.Something about the combination of Nolan and Lazzara created perfectly crafted melodies laced with angst.Just writing this makes me want to give the whole thing another listen. HIGHLY recommended."
4,The best,"Some of the reviews claim Taking Back Sunday is the best thing to happen to American music. I won't go that far though I do love every cd they've released so far. Taking Back Sunday helped create the whole emotional (or ""emo"") music movement with ""Tell All Your Friends"". You either loved them or you hated them, but you'd hard pressed to find someone who never heard of them.This cd was very good but did have a few kinks in it. There was also a couple songs I couldn't get out of my head. So overall, I would give this album 4 stars just because of the few songs that didnt stick. However some of the songs are more than 5 stars, like Great Romances Of The 20th Century, You're So Last Summer and Timberwolves at New Jersey. Those songs are as close to perfect as you can get."
4,My first Taking Back Sunday album!,"I was very impressed when I heard this CD in a friend's car, so I went out and bought it!I was not disappointed in the least.This really does satisfy my punk/emo needs. Full of emotion, young adult problems, they really do make it bleed realistically.Favorite tracks, ""Cute without the ""E""!*grins*Go out and buy some good music, but I can't guarantee you'll like it, because this stuff IS a bit different. Loud, and a bit confusing. But emotional and at times, eye opening.A favorite lyric from this album ""...and you can slit my throat, and with my last gasping breath, I'll apologize for bleeding on your shirt.""Stuff like that is just like...WOW....."
3,"It's decent, but I don't get all the hype.","I heard so much about how great this album was, but there were only 2 songs on it I liked, only one I really liked. I think the hype exceeded the actual product. It's decent but just EMO. I gave it away to a friend, who gave it back. My suggestion, just buy the one or two good songs online.I got this at the same time as Brand New's ""Deja Entendu"" which I think is much better. The songs had much more depth and more extensive development (they took the concept of a bridge to a new level), the production was phenomenal and the lyrics were really good. I'm going to recommend that album instead."
5,All my friends told me...and I'm glad,"I dig this album. First song I heard off it was ""You're So Last Summer"" which totally grabbed my attention with the ""you could slit my throat"" bit. It's not sick or morbid. It's sarcastic and funny. Also I love ""Ghost Man on Third"" for the screamo and the way he says ""for headlights dressed in a fashion that's fitting to the inconsistencies of my moods."" I sing that line over and over. Save up your allowance or take aluminum cans to the recycling center and buy this puppy!"
5,best 10 tracks ever put on a CD,Every song on this cd is great. I listen to it everyday. A truly amazing band with a lot to say and they are incredible live. I've seen them three times. I've never seen anyone get a crowd moving like they can. Dig it...
5,"great, great album","I was a bit apprehensive about enjoying this album for some reason. It's the type that took a little while to catch on. But once it did, I absolutely loved it. That was about nine months ago and I still listen to it on a regular basis. For someone who seeks out new music on a daily basis, that should say a lot."
2,Not Good for Video Files,"Bought this USB version after happily using a Firewire Lacie external HD for many years. This USB version does not work well with Mac OSX. Some files (in my case, video) will not copy over. The error msg is a ""-50"" error about a problem with the file name. Worse, files that appear to copy successfully are corrupted and won't play."
4,"AFFORDABLE, USEFUL ND NICE DESIGN. THE ONLY THING IS THAT IS A BIT SLOW BUT THE REST IS VERY GOOD.",Very nice external HD. The USB cable could be a little longer but not a big issue for me.
5,Stunningly beautiful and might be highly reliable...,"I've purchased this drive along with the Kensington Dome USB hub. The shipping was really fast, about 3 business days.Anyways, I was originally looking at a Firewire Western Digital My Book drive but turned it down because of the abundance of bad review concerning reliability. I've been wanting a Firewire drive but they tend to be more expensive. Performance is not bad with this USB drive. I see that people really like this drive and so far I'm digging the sleek look. This was a great bargain as well, with the drive and the hub.The only downside is that the drive makes some loud clicking noises sometimes. This is my first Lacie drive so I can't say anything about reliability now. The only disclaimer I would give any prospective buyers is that the metal is darker than what you see in the picture."
4,Good Design,"I would prefer a design, with an internal transformer. That would allow for a standard power plug into the unit. This unit has a proprietary s-video-looking connector... the type that you have to line up just right to get it plugged in. I assume heat dissipation issues prevent anyone from doing this.The LaCie 250 has a power switch. With the LaCie 500, they took a step backwards. The 500 has a power button. With the button there is no visual or tactile way to tell if the unit is on or off. You must plug it in (not knowing the state)... wait for it to mount... press the power button... wait for it to mount...Other than that, it is the best deign I have found. It is reliable, stackable, compact, and quiet."
2,Worked great until it died 11 months later,"Simply put, this drive was a dream until it died 12 days before the 1 year warranty was up...good timing. Glad I bought another external to put mirror backups onto. Buy with caution, back up early and often."
4,Good Item,"Overall this is a nice Ext HD. I personally liked the quality and design of the tool. However, some minor things I did not like:1- The electrical plug-in end that goes into the HD is hard to fit in or remove2- It's fan is a bit noisy sometimes."
1,Died after 1-2 years of minimal use,"Tried to turn it on this morning, and it make repeated whirring sounds as if it can't spin up. Not a good backup solution, very disappointed."
1,Dont Buy,Used this drive for family pics and was seldom used. Burnt out after minimal use. Now I have to go try to salvage the most valuable data I have. Don't put yourself through the same nightmare.I will use online backups from now on...
1,FAILER NUMBER 2,The replacement drive that lacie has sent me has also failed and I'm returning it for a third one in 1 years time!
1,Failed after 1 year,"I bought this product in early 2007 and it became malfunctional after 1 year of use. It showed some signs of breaking down a couple of days before it completely went down - like failure to mount 1 out of three times, weird starting sound, etc. - and I regret that I should've backed up my data at that time. Anyway, I continued to use it ignoring the premonitions and all of a sudden it completely blacked out.I set it aside for a couple of months after its failure, and wondering if the hard disk itself was still alive, I took it apart - it's so hard to disassemble the unit that I had to use brutal force to crack open it - and took out the hard disk. Using a SATA-to-USB connector, I hooked it up to my desktop Windows machine and voila! it showed up alive and I was able to back up all my precious data.All in all, it was the enclosure problem, not the hard disk problem after all. I guess LaCie needs to make the controller board strong enough for this kind of repetitious stressful jobs."
2,Failed after 14 months,"I bought this drive to backup my iMac. It was only turned on when I was doing a backup until March 08. Since then it has been doing Time Machine backups and is on all the time. The drive still mounts, but Time Machine can no longer write to it and I get a failure message every time it tries. I'm pretty disappointed. It was obviously functioning fine before, so the unit itself isn't defective. Hope to avoid buying another LaCie."
1,6 Months - We had a good run together,"Bought this through a Mac store package... I always assumed it had a fan since one always seemed to be humming (though the ""fan"" obviously did not work, since the HD was always very hot).I used to keep all my multimedia files on here, and fortunately moved all my music back to my laptop a month ago. Today, just after our six-month anniversary together, I lost all my movie/video files, amongst others. Never had much notice (besides the heating/humming that I had experienced since day 1), until I heard loud clicking when I turned the drive on this afternoon.I do not recommend this drive. The price is not right, unless you enjoy paying to for the time and effort to re-back up a couple hundred gigs of data onto an additional HD that you will eventually have to buy again."
5,Excellent ET harddrive at a fantastic price,"I now own two of these nice units. I really like the one-touch backup feature that comes with the software. Drag and drop files, one-touch backup - it works anyway you prefer."
3,Form over function.,"This is a great looking hard drive. However, it comes with a USB cable that is short almost to the point of being useless.Further, it is loud, the drive keeps spinning and the fan is on even when the drive is not plugged in. For this reason I am forced to turn the drive off after every use. This gets quite annoying, I am using it as a time machine backup drive and I don't want to constantly have to turn it on and off because of noise. I have my MacBook Pro set to put drives to sleep after a period of inactivity and it works with every drive except this one.Overall, it's not bad enough to warrant a return, but I wouldn't buy it again as there are many other options."
3,"Love the design, but is very slow.","I have a Lacie drive at work that uses the firewire connection on my Mac. I loved the price (on sale) of this item and the capacity, but the connection is a USB 2.0. It is very slow, and I have to eject the drive from my Mac desktop in order to be able to eject a CD. It can also take 3-5 minutes for it to mount on my desktop once plugged in and turned on. The capacity is great, the price was right - so if you have patience, this is a good drive to use for back-up."
5,"So far, it is perfect","I have only had this hard drive for about a month, so we'll have to see how long it lasts but so far it is great. Tons of storage for the price and as a drive to backup my computer it is plenty fast. Also super simple construction without anything special. Works perfectly fine so far."
4,Great Drive,"Great drive but I wish I would have gotten the firewire model because I share it with my MAC and IBM. My IBM only supports USB 1.0 which isn't bad but the USB port on the MAC is pretty fast. If you need to create a FAT32 partition size greater than 32 Meg you must do it on the MAC because Windows won't allow you to. Go figure. The drive it really great, it is my second one for LaCie."
4,First one sounded like a truck....Second one is fine,"Overall, this drive is very good and I have had no problems with it after returning the first one received from Amazon. The first drive had a horrible, grinding sound every time I wrote or retrieved data from it. I returned that one to Amazon (excellent return policy..its why I buy from Amazon) and the replacement has been running quietly for 3 months now."
4,Great external drive in a small and attractive case!,"It's a little noisy when it's being accessed, but I mostly use it for automatic backups at night, so I rarely am around to hear it ;)It gets a little warm, but for such a huge drive, I'm not surprised. The internal drives I have get that warm too, I just don't notice them since they're in the computer. So, I'm sure that it's normal.The form factor is GREAT, really really small, I was surprised. I might have been OK with it being a little bit bigger if that meant it could have active cooling (a fan) though. But it's great for taking with you when traveling, because it's not much bigger than a thick paperback book."
3,EASY BUT SLOW,"I just bought it. Not very impresed by the Porsche design...???But I took it out of the box and connected it... beautiful it worked !!! But... it took about 1 and a half hour to reformat to NTFS for windows XP. After that I transfer 170 Gig to the drive and it took all night long.The next morning I tried for smaller data and it work well. It does its job. Very smooth and quiet. No temperature. Obviously it is a storaging device, not something that you want to work actively with. All in all, good purchase if your looking for room and nothing else."
1,LaCie 301103U F.A. Porsche 500 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive,"Looks good, goes SLOW!The USB connection is the problem with this product. What ever LaCie says about the item_it's slow. For your money you could do much better going with another LaCie Hard Drive that is not USB. I have purchased other LaCie External Hard Drives (Firewire) and they are great work horses you can't kill. This baby is slow and bulky. You can admire the case for a LONG time while your data takes for_ever to copy over to this EX_Hard drive.Move on!"
4,LaCie 500 GB USB external hard drive,"The LaCie harddrive is compact, quite, and runs cool, I use it as a back up device and as additional storage space for my Laptop. It was easy to install the only problem is that you have to reformat the disk to NFTS inorder for a complete backup, this is not completely explained in the instructions, I found the info on the WEB. Otherwise it works great."
1,Buyer Beware - Avoid like the plague!,"I purchased two LaCie hard drives, and they failed one after the other within several weeks of purchase. I contacted LaCie for a replacement or refund and was sent on a wild goose chase between one department and the next. In the end, I was stuck with two non-working hard drives.My experience with LaCie is not unique. Please do not be drawn in by the design or the price point. Look elsewhere for your data storage solutions."
1,Totally unreliable,"I bought two of these. Both have now failed. Given that both were never moved and never jostled, I conclude they are simply badly made. I will never buy this brand again."
2,OK while it lasted,"Purchased partly based on good reviews and on the LaCie name - though it was a bit expensive. Very light use for 2 years 1 month. Worked as expected. Then a month after the warranty expired, it failed. I took it apart (being a bit of a geek) and attached it to a laptop using a special adapter cable kit; it worked fine so I recovered the data. What failed was the electronics in the enclosure, not the drive itself so I can re-use the drive in a new enclosure. This is unacceptable reliability - I have much older equipment that is running fine. And most folks who buy drives like this would probably not be able to rescue it on their own."
1,Don't count on this drive lasting,"Okay, you see the mixed reviews. Some say it's reliable and others say it's crap. Well I thought it was a good deal at the time of purchase and 2.5years later it's dead (code 10). It was my back-up with a lot of data that I could afford to lose (but would have preferred not to lose). Given my experience and the fact that over 1/3 of the reviews are only 1 star, don't risk your data to this drive. I would not recommend this drive to ANYONE!"
1,"Died after 2 years, no more Lacie drives for me.","I am not sure what else can be said, the drive died after 2 years of moderate use. I used it as a back-up solution for my photography and video files. It was not in heavy use at all. Bummer. I think I'll stick to Western Digital drives."
2,Bad Power Supply,"Had this for about 2 1/2 years. Used with a Mac to save iMovie projects. Started having problems with it mounting. Would have to push really hard & twist the power supply cable where the connector was for it to get recognized & now it doesn't get recognized. Not knowing what the problem was (enclosure SATA interface vs. power supply cable problem) I debated with getting a new power supply cord ($20+$10 shipping) from Lacie website or just buying a new USB SATA external hard drive enclosure ($20). I opted for the 2nd option, removed the Seagate 500GB drive from the Lacie enclosure & fortunately all my data was recognized & did not have to reformat. Lacie Porsche was a nice looking enclosure but what's the point if it doesn't longer than a few years?"
1,PLEASE DON'T COUNT ON THIS,"I just bought one from local CompUSA store. After I loaded my photos and videos from Alaska trip, it died on me, giving constant cranking sounds. I am just hoping that I can recover my photos from it or I will be dead!"
1,LOUD Fan,"Garbage. Well, unless you like the wonderful sound of a power saw starting up and running every five minutes for 5 minutes. The fan is bad in this drive. That's why it's so inexpensive. You get what you pay for. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
4,Best purchase I've ever made,"This is the best hard-drive I've ever purchase for my computer. I works great, right from the start. There's one little thing, that forced me to give 4 stars, instead of five stars; that's the 465GB it has, instead of the advertised 500GB. I feel a little cheated. However, it does work well, and I can overlook the lost of 35GB. It could have been worst. Highly Recommended."
1,tec tec tec... in less than 2 monhts,"Less than 2 months ago I bought this hard drive 500GB and backed up all my data on it.Today, when I try to access the data, some files are missing (empty directoris), there is a noise (tec tec tec) and an error message: cannot copy file: data error (cyclic redundancy ckeck). It seems that I lost all my data.There is also a CD but with too little information and no SW that can help in diagnosing or data recovery.Another concern: the cables that attach the device to the computer are not standard (USB in one side but proprietary at the other). I was thinking what I will do if the cable is broken or missed."
4,Works Great,I have had no problems with this external HD yet. I am using it to backup 2 systems and so far it is flawless.
4,"Good, but can be noisy","It works just fine with my Intel MacBook, I did two partitions, one in FAT32 so I can use it with PC too (to share photos, pics, etc), and the other in HFS+. The OSX recognizes them as 2 different HDs and when you eject one the other one ejects too.The only bad thing is that sometimes it makes some vibration noise, which you can kind of reduce moving it or touching the exterior, I guess is the metal cover."
5,Great external drive - good looks and reliable !,"I now have a fleet of Lacie USB external hard drives :-) I started with the 160GB, 250, then the 500 and also have a USB powered 80GB (pocket version). I must say that I am extremely pleased with all of them. I am medium user and primarily use the drive for backup archival of my data / photos. The drive has been working perfectly for many months now and I have not found any bad sectors or experienced any data loss to date. A great product and does exactly what it is supposed to! Only point to note is that the power supply for the 500 is not compatible with the 160 and 250 GB drives ..."
5,Works as expected,"This is a great product. I have used up nearly all of the memory and had this for a year and it has not shown any signs of wear and tear at all. It never overheats even though I have accidently left it on overnight but that's due to the very quiet fan. You don't even notice that the fan is even on ever unless you actually put your ear up to the vent. I've backed up everything from pictures to movies to music to .exe files and do not have a complaint about it at all. The only thing is that a larger than expected portion of the memory is taken up by the drivers and such so you really have about 465 GB to work with. Other than that works like a charm. And if you are wondering about size, this is smaller than a VHS cassette. The lengths and widths are also smaller than a dvd case with the depth being about the size of 2 dvd case depths. Very compact."
3,"Sophisticated design, good software for Macs. Better as a back up drive","I purchased this external LaCie hard drive to use as a back up drive for my home business. Since it doesn't seem to have a fan in it, I wouldn't recommend using it on a constant basis, maybe only use it for occasional back ups. The software that comes with it is great for backing up, especially on macs. I was so used to using briefcases in the windows environment, and the Silver Keeper software that comes with it is close. I recommend this drive as a back up."
5,Nothing hard about this drive!,Plugged it in and it worked right away. I use it for backing up my music and pictures. So easy to use and not too expensive.
4,Great Drive for the Money!,"I recently purchased this drive from Amazon and am very pleased with how well it performs. It is quick. I use it for music storage, music production, and data backup (I have a lot of music on my computer). I leave it on all the time and the drive is warm to the touch, but very quiet. I don't see the value of the ""design by F. A. Porsche"" because it's just an ordinary metal box with some venting! OK?! Big deal! But this drive is a Good Deal for its capacity."
4,Does the job,Plugged it in and it works. It seems fast (once I realized that it was a mistake to have it plugged into my antique USB 1 hub) although I'm only using it for unsupervised backups. It's reasonably quiet although I'm not usually around when it's spun up. Overall I'm very happy.
1,Power cord shorted,"Can't say much about the product. The power cord shorted and exploded shortly after turning on (in middle of format). Returned drive, but was told there were no more of these so could not get a replacement."
1,STAY AWAY! BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,"I bought a refurbished LaCie Hard Drive that did not work. I wrote to their Customer Service department explaining that their product did not work the first time I took it out of the box and that I expected a full refund. After the representative finally gave me the e-mail address of her supervisor (as I wasn't allowed to call), the supervisor hasn't responded to any of my e-mails. Not only does the product not work, their customer service is reprehensible. DO NOT BUY ANY LACIE PRODUCTS."
1,Might last a year - if you're lucky.,"I've bought two LaCie's over the past two years. In both instances after about a year or so it will only show up on my desktop intermittently, then completely stop showing up. Data recovery from one of these things costs between $600 - $2500 (I spent $1000), not to mention the cost of replacing it with another drive. Do not buy this brand."
3,Good drive. Runs very hot,"This drive runs hot to the touch. Some of the paint has bubbled up on the bottom. I let it cool off for 10 minutes prior to putting back in my laptop bag. Also, the USB cable is very short, but since I use it only with my laptop, this isn't a problem. Using it on a desktop/tower would require a longer USB cable.Drive works as it should. I've put all my mp3's on it, for use with my Ipod. Itunes is set up to look for content on this drive, so I can update my ipod on the road, or at home."
5,Reliable,"This is my 4th LaCie external drive. I've been running the 160GB and two 250s for 4+ and 2+ years, respectively. I use one as a primary shared repository for files on the home network, including the TiVo. The others are backups. The share drive has been on 24/7 for 2 years. The other drives are only turned on when I need them.I've seen mixed reviews for these drives, but my experience has been very positive. With the usage outlined above, I have had reliable, fast, and zero-maintenance operation."
1,Great but dosnt last,"Well I have had 5 LaCie Drives (2 One TB, 2 500 GB and a 320 GB) They work great. I mean they look and run cool. In the past two years Both of my TBs went down as could not be reconized any more and one of my 500 GB did the same thing. I will never by a LaCie Product again. Sure there fairly Cheap, great looking and working drives...The Fact is they don't last. They die out of no where. I am very disapointed with them and feel I have been cheated. So I do NOT recomend this Product and I do NOT recoment LaCie. I called them to see if they could help me...for what they said...Pretty much send it to us and we might fix it...if you pay...Some warrenty they have. Horible Horible Horible...Never Again."
2,Worked well for a while,"Bought the drive in 2007; Black Friday at Best Buy...Three and a half years later (a couple of days ago), the system would not recognize the drive. A USB error Code 10 - cannot start. I thought ""Darn some USB misconfiguration."" After plugging it into another computer with failed results, and then listening to it I realized I had other problems - the drive did not spin. It just clicked. Google to the rescue - many others have had this problem WITH THE POWER SUPPLY, not the drive.Right now, I have hooked up another PS and I am off-loading my data. I am considering whether or not I want to buy another PS for it (they cost $20)......"
2,don't waste your time,"and don't fall for the sleek look. this is the hot girl with herpes! i'm sure it matters little now...this thing is probably outdated but when i bought it, it died out in less than a month and took all of my files with it."
1,LOUD Clicking noise,"When I first got it, the drive has this really loud clicking noise. That's not a good sign for hard drives. I returned the product right away."
4,I'm On My 2nd One,"What I like like about this drive is its simplicity. No ""One-Button-Make-Bread"" stuff and no software. You don't pay extra for all that stuff you probably won't use. I've had one drive that I carry back and forth to my car for about a year and I just purchased another for a client who does the same thing. I can't speak for its ruggedness because I really baby it but I have had no problems."
4,good one!!,"very solid - square type designyou can simply stack one when you buy the additional oneyou can use this one for Mac Or PcYou can simply divide the section of Hard Drive SpaceComparing to the price, it has reasonable hard drive spaceIt has an on and off light and it easily pops up on the screenafter you turn on the deviceIt's a good product so farI recommend this one"
4,LaCie 500 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive,I unpacted the parcell and quickly read the instructions. The software provided worked well on Vista. It provided a complete backup with no problems but the backup was slow. I do not believe that the backup time was any slower than other backup units but there are some untis that are easier to use (the one click which I do not own) and some of the other backup units I considered buying. The reason I purchased this unit was price. For the price I feel it was a good investment.Jim
5,Absolutely the Perfect Pump - Careful with the Natural Leather,"I LOVE this shoe!It's a perfect heel height, classic pointed toe, comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot. Perfectly proportioned with all-day comfort.If I win Lotto, I plan to order every color with spares in case it's ever discontinued.The natural leather is lovely, but scuffs easily. I strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap/oil to give it a bit of durability.HIGHLY recommended, even for wider feet!"
1,this book stinks,"Woe to the world: looks like postmodernism is here to stay. Travesty is just a transcript of a driver talking to his passengers before crashing the car in an ""arranged accident."" Along the way, he pontificates about love and betrayal, a collection of cliches and bad epigrams. Nothing really happens in this book, just this guy rambling on and on. I'm glad this book is out of print: it will save the world a lot of time. If for some reason you like this book, you might also like Donald Antrim's A Hundred Brothers."
3,Glass Bottom Springform & Carrying Case,"This is a wonderful idea but it still could be improved. The ledge where the glass bottom sits on the carrying case should be larger and have either a tighter fit or have a non-skid ledge just like the bottom part of the carrying case. If you're not extremely careful while carrying it with your best cheesecake inside, it will flip out and slide from side to side. Other than that, it's a great way to refrigerate or transport a cake and they really knew what they were doing when they designed the lid for locking the lid to the bottom. It's very secure once locked correctly."
3,Particulary bad!! And Especially good!,"When I bought this one , I was afraid of leaking. Because many reviews said that not only this one but also many glass bottom springforms have the problem of leaking. So when I got this one, I opened package carefully ( I have to use original package for replacing ) ,poured water and checked their bottom as soon as possible... Unfortunately it was leaking so much. So I ask Amazon to replace. They send me new one very fast !! Because of some trouble they send not new one but new two. So I tried three springforms. Two were leaking and one was so so... I considered I bought or not . At last I decided to buy one.Amazon is always speedy and mindful, I feel. Thanks.Now I'm completely satisfied with this springform with case. It needs no wrap in refrigerator. It is delightful to bring my cakes in it. It can serve easily. You can use steel Knife to cut without caring of scratching."
4,Unique Art & Stories,"This book contains interesting stories from Ekow's experiences. Some are fairly straight forward, some are more open to interpretation. The same can be said for his artwork - also in this book. He has a unique style and uses a pen and ink medium.Some of the abstract pieces are a little unsettling. Maybe they were meant to be? Maybe that's why I like them. Anyway, what would make it better? More in depth stories. I'm sure the stories are simply to enhance the art, but I find myself wanting more story telling. Let me hear more cultural details.Nice first work. What's next?"
2,Leftovers,As Royo's work goes this book does not live up to his usual standard. There seems to be just a hodgepodge of art that he and his son did with a dark twist; his other collections are much more enjoyable and unless you're into some demented stuff don't bother with this one.
3,Royo with a Twist,"As an avid Royo fan, I was on the edge of my seat to recieve his latest addition to the collection. Prohibited showed a very ""dark"" Royo, and not the usual darkness...this went beyond his normally violent/sexy approach and was filled with sexual violence. This book is still a work of art, all of Royo's paintings are beautiful and this is no exception...just not what I was expecting. Plus I wasn't really happy with the smattering of his son's work throughout the ""very small"" collection. Prohibited is the smallest release yet, with few paintings and small pages. It felt more like a thrown together volume to advertise for his up and coming son, rather than a compilation of new visions. The end result? A few VERY good paintings, but mostly fluff...I was disappointed over all."
5,The title says it all,"""Prohibited"" is the sexually most explicit of Royo's books. Again, astonishingly beautiful, sexy women are the center of attention. It's like a notebook for ""III Millenium"" 'coz the background is dark, suggesting danger. My biggest problem with this book is that the pictures are ranging from small to tiny, which gives me this 'notebook'-impression. Other than that it is high quality work. Royo's use of light is simply excellent - as always."
2,Could be much better,"The artwork that is in the book is interesting but the number of larger artworks is disappointing, most are small. The book itself is thin and small. Overall a great disappointment compared to the other Royo books I own and not worth the price when compared to what I paid for the other full size Royo books that are packed with full page artworks."
3,good but not what I expected,"I am an admiror of royo's great artistic skills and when I saw that this new piece was being released I didn't hesitate in buying it,while I wasn't disapointed at royo's displayed art I did expect a lot more than this,.it has a very small amount of illustrations and this book is just about sexual imagery,no fantasy or general ideas displayed here,besides these illustrations aren't as overwhelming as those you usualy see from royo's wide collection. also there are some of his sons works displayed throughout the book,but I didn't like them because they have nothing to do with royo's style,they're completely out of context. the texts that you find on this book are somewhat twisted. actually this little book is like a collectors item,not really something very special.only worth getting it if you like to have a complete collection of royo's books."
2,"I really like Royo, but this left a lot to be desired","I've been a big fan of Luis Royo's work since I started purchasing his books. I like his style of fantasy art and I think he's very talented. That being said, I was rather disappointed with this album and would just as soon not have it as part of my collection. There wasn't much to this book, the pictures were small, and although I like seeing some of the starting sketches progress to a more finished product this book seemed to be nothing but what I wasn't looking for. If you're new to Luis Royo, I would not suggest this book to start. Start with Dark Labyrinth, Subversive Beauty, Visions, or Malefic."
5,Great product,These boxers are really comfortable and my girlfriend loves them. This line is very good.
2,Not that great.,Very hard to keep the guy's hat on his head and the rifle in his hands. Disappointing.
5,Great Story,Glad I found this series. It was the first hard copy I bought after school because I could not wait until it came out in paperback!
1,Worst book I've ever read,"It looked promising, but I found the characters shallow, insipid, and one-dimentional; the dialogue seemed contrived and each time a person's eyes ""welled up with tears"", I felt the urge to scream! Good story idea, but poorly written. Sorry."
5,a must read!!!,"the texas series by Fern Michaels absolutely takes you out of your world, and enter the family of the Texas Colemans.this series is the best I have ever read.I imagined every character, had them all pictured in my head.I became so engrossed in the colemans and their trial and tribulations. I savored every word. couldn't put them down because they were so wonderful, but hated to end the series.I recommend this series for someone who wants to escape your world and enter another.be warned, you'll want more!!!!absolutely the best!!!"
1,Depressing!!,"I don't know why I even finished reading this book! I think it was because I was waiting for something good to happen!!! Billie should have divorced Moss WAY earlier than she did. She should have left him to die by himself instead of expecting the man who genuinely loved her to wait while she consoled her cheating jerk of a husband on his death bed.Thad should have stood up for Billie when everyone was berating her in front of him.My husband actually asked me ""what's wrong? are you sad?"" and I was like ""oh. wow. I really think this book has given me a mood of depression!!""I can't believe there are books in the series that follow. If I read them I might be due for medication!I might peruse one or two at the library and at least see if Thad and Billie end up happy."
3,Kirlian is smooth and gothic and also melodic,"this is the first of there cds i've actually heard and its original is from 1988 not 97, and anyways it is good enough for a gothic cd. worth checking out but i recommend listening to Collide if you like this. Collide is much better!"
4,Nice set of tools,"I find this very useful at church, it makes a lot of the things I used to do manually simple and quick, and changes are quick too.One thing is missing, which my daughter gave me and works great. OpenOffice.org, which is like Microsoft Office and opens all of my Word documents but is absolutely free. So our church council had no trouble approving it!So yes, get this product, and get OpenOffice.org (here on Amazon, the OpenOffice.org Resource Kit book and CD), and you will have an excellent set of software."
5,Great Sax CD,Being a sax player in a professional band I an always looking for sax players to listen to to get new ideas in playing styles. A friend recommended listening to Larry Mckenna. Well I did and I really enjoy the soft sound and style of this player. Great playing style. I plan to check out more of his CD's. Great CD.
3,Honky tonk Fred,"This is a shift back to more country & western music. You will not find any real rockers here. The good news: great pedal steel work, some real good breakup songs, ""Rev it Up"" could be a Thunderbird's tune, and the final cut is great. Bad news: not a single train song, no Washboard Hank, and it's a little short. As a neon lit beer drinking albumn, it's pretty good, but don't expect anything like the last couple of albumns. It's head and shoulders better than what passes for country music currently."
5,Hooked on the Housewives,"Love love love love love this show! I can't get enough! Enough said. The show is so juicy and enthralling. Season One alone is so good.I highly recommend buying this and entering Wisteria Lane to learn about Susan, Bree, Lynette, and Gabby's lives as Desperate Housewives.Hope this helped! :)"
5,Desperate Housewives,A must for anyone who loves the show. I personally have never watched it but bought it as a Christmas present.
5,Excelent !!!!,"Charmed, it's the most excelent comedy, drama and everything that I saw in my life, I love it !!!"
5,Great,"I fell in love with this show last year and am still in love with it. Let's face it, it's a good show. Pure comedy I love Lenett's boy's they are so bad. Gabrielle is a schemer and Suszane is just clumbsy. Bree is just out there! All good thing when wrtiing characters for a # 1 show.Shout out to the cast and director!"
5,This is a MUST buy! You will love the show,"The characters are a blast and each you get to know so well. Eventually, you'll look at your girlfriends and think, ""oh, that was such a Bree thing to say""... they are so much fun to watch and route for each week. There's a lot of humor and the underlying plot that carries through always keep you in suspense wondering what the real mystery and the real truths are. Not like a soap, but more like a suspenseful, comedy, drama that you'll be glad you own."
2,We're a sick society to reward these evil people,"Why is our culture glorifying adultery, violence and murder by giving this show so much acceptance? The first season episodes has a murder with a blender pitcher, an elderly man murdered by his wife and kept in a deep freeze, Teri Hatcher locked out of her house without any clothes on--yet justice has never punished anyone except Carlos, the poor Mexican American who's kind to his mom. And of course scenes from season one repeat every year in best moments from old shows episodes--I guess the writers ran out of perfect murders in the plot that week. To top it all off the ""wives"" are pictured as kind parents to their kids. It would've given Walt Disney a heart attack Sunday night if he were alive today."
2,Great Show... Poor DVD Features,"I think all nice things about the show have been said. I pre-ordered this Item since May. Unfurtunatelly in those days Amazon didnt publish all the feautures this DVD series would have. NO spanish subtitles or any other language. But it comes close captured + English subtitles (both)I really Dont understand why if Desperate Housewives is a great show, the DVD producers IGNORED the spahish market. How difficult could have been to put the spanish subtitles??? In Mexico we can watch this series with them or even dubbed. Fortunatelly my english is not bad. But my family doesnt speak english.Salvador Silva, Monterrey México"
4,Yes I'm a man... a real man too!,I am NOT the kind of man you'd ever think would leave a review for a chick show but my girlfriend Tina started watching this on Instant Video and I happened to be in the room. (I am not making this up!) And... it's NOT a bad show! I have no idea how much it changes and gets more estrogen-filled over time but it's not a bad drama/comedy combo. We've now watched about 8 episodes (thanks Amazon Prime!!!) and it's one of the most unique shows we've seen in a while (although I still prefer reality shows).
5,Very Nice,"My wife enjoyed it got here fast good price, packaged well would buy from seller again. And Terri Hatcher looked very nice in this season. Thankyou"
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"Great Show, received in quick time of delivery, DVD in case was loose but worked fine. Will order from this company again, great customer service."
1,the dumbest show in many years,After 2 episodes I turned off the TV and I will never watch it ever again. This is the dumbest and most boring show in many years. Do they really need money that bad? The acting is lame and really bad. The plot is always the same and why do people watch this crappy non-funny boring show is beyond me. I will not buy this DVD and I hope I can burn all the copies I find. When I think about it this show is the worst show ever made.
2,Not very enjoyable...,"Contary to Frida Admirer's review, only one housewife cheated (Gabrielle). Bree considered cheating on her unfaithful husband as payback... but didn't. I wish she had. I didn't like that she had to be pure and true to the cheating scum.I gave this show only 2 stars because it becomes quite boring and repetitive, as well as a little depressing.. The majority of the women have been cheated on by their husbands (Susan/Karl, Bree/Rex, and it's implied that Tom cheated on Lynette at one point) and none of the women have enough self-respect to leave the husbands. Although it's possible Lynette might; she still doesn't know about Tom's affair."
2,Best Packaging Idea,"I have yet to see more than one or two episodes of this show, so I am not familiar with it. But from what I've seen, the opening title sequence really is fantastic artistically. And I can see it in my head like it exists already what the DVD packaging SHOULD look like: the same kind of clear plastic as ""Sex & The City"" where it folds. And it should be covered with the Adam and Eve-type of art from the opening, like Hieronymous Bosch's art (Garden of Earthly Delights). It should focus on the large apples and the nude figures with the figs/bushes/trees. This would be fantastic packaging. Don't you think??"
1,What a disgrace to America,These women Desperate Housewives give real life women a bad name and also a bad influnce on them. Shows like this is the reason why women don't respect men right now. It's such a sad world that women do nothing but stab men in the back and not show remorse for it. As far as this show goes the only time I see brief nudity is when one fo the wives was locked out side of her house naked and the other wife who is latin was in the bath tumb with a teenage boy. I figure since this show is on abc which is not cable they are trying to tone down the sexuality so they won't get find by the FCC.
1,"Great Eye Candy,but Horrible show","I love the Ladies on this show. the chicks on this show I can watch all day&night on Mute. but on the Acting part of this show forgetaboutit. 3rd&4th tier Acting on here.equal bad writing.this show is basically a Low-Budget version of Sex in the city. this show works for what it serves. the Eye candy element is a must see&this show helps with my vision,but in terms of quality,depth,etc... this ain't gonna make Anne Rice or Terry Mcmillian lose any sleep.well on 2nd thought maybe Terry Mcmillian could get in on the show&help out the writing."
2,wanna buy mine?,"Gee, I wish that I could sell my Desperate Housewives boxed set to one of you people who actually liked it. I didn't really enjoy it. And for some reason I (and I'm sure others) am not able to sell mine here as it doesn't seem to be an option. So...want to buy a used Desperate Housewives boxed set? Complain to Amazon."
3,"Good, But I Didn't Think It Lived Up To The Hype","I bought this dvd set (along with Lost) because I read several reviews saying how great it was. After watching all of season one of Desperate Housewives, I didn't find it to be particularly great.I didn't become very attached to any of the characters and although the show was often interesting and whacky, I didn't find it to be anything overly special, although there were a couple of episodes in the middle of the season which were very exciting.I will probably watch the set one more time and then sell it.If you are looking for something different that is somewhat fun to watch, you may want to take a chance and buy this set or rent it."
5,DVD is coming in August!,"This show has it all - comedy, suspense, drama, romance ... this is the best written show in a such a long time. The main 4 ladies along with Nicolette Sheridan bring so much to this show. Even the minor characters, like Paul, Mike, are so good. Can't wait for the DVD in August!"
2,"fabulous show, crappy dvd set","in addition to all the other complaints ppl have made about this set, (dvd skipping, special features - incl. spoilers - on the first disc instead of being on it's own.. so as to not ruin the show for someone who hasn't seen it already).... it ""currently"" doesn't come with an episode guide booklet. i've bought this stupid set THREE times.. and returned it THREE times. 2 out of the 3 the packaging was crappy as well. (jewel casing coming off of the cardboard, broken disc holders - the discs kept falling out).. maybe they should rethink their marketing strategies, not to mention pay a litttttle more attention to product detail and quality. because whereas this is a great show, they're bumping down my enthusiasm about it with crappy products."
5,A sinful pleasure,"Although targetted to women at first, the show gained popularity with a wide male audience,both straight and gay. The cast is top notch and all the characters resemble someone that we all know in our own private Wisteria Lanes. Who does not have the nosy neighbor? The soccer mom or the go getter? And is there not the sexy mom or newcomer that everyone talks about? And who does not know someone hiding a long held secret? The show is amusing, dark, and hooks you from the first, with the mystery of why one of the ladies killed herself, when her life appeared perfect. The chemistry amongst the characters and the quirky writing made for an entertaining tv season. Let's hope the second time around is as good as the first!"
3,Bonus Material Spoilers,"I've just finished watching the first four episodes of the first season of Desperate Housewives, and I was quite enjoying myself. The show successfully combines multiple genres including comedy, soap opera and a season long mystery. But whose thick-headed idea was it to include bonus material on disk one with spoilers for the remainder of the season? Beware: if you are watching this series for the first time, the bonus feature ""A Walk Down Wisteria Lane"" reveals not one, but several key mystery plot developments prematurely. Any grade schooler would have known to include this feature on the final disk."
5,best...,"adorei o site , recebi tudo lacrado confome o esperado e até mais rapido do que eu esperava... podem confiar o amazon é nota 10."
3,DVD bad quality,"The episodes themselves are obviously good - however the DVD quality is quite bad. There's glitches here and there. No, I didn't drop the DVDs or do anything bad with them. I just popped the videos in, and the DVDs stop in Disc 3 and Disc 4. After a few seconds of skipping to the next chapter, it works again."
1,Stupid and pointless,"The title of this review says it all. Desperate Housewives cannot be compared in any way to Sex and the City. Desperate Housewives has nothing valuable to discuss. I found it boring. I can see that very few people agree with this opinion but to me the series is shallow and meaningless, not to mention the idiotic roles and the very terrible acting."
2,Poor Quality DVDs,"LOVE the show, but the quality of the DVDs is poor. Many glitches! Cleaned them and it helped a little. Not impressed with the quality!"
1,I don't get it,"I tried watching this show, it's boring and not funny at all. It seems like it's just a hyped up primetime soap opera. Plus it's sad that adultery is supposed to be funny."
1,THIS IS RIDICULOUS! HOW CAN YOU WATCH THIS?!?!?!,"I can't believe this! How can people actually love this show? It doesn't make sense! Have any of the creators of these shows ever heard of the word IMAGINATION? Obviously not because none of them have any of it. This show sucks beyond my own words. I'd give it zero stars if I had to. It's not like this show happens in real life, does it? Gimme a break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've seen better shows than this, and they have something that this show doesn't have: IMAGINATION!"
2,Factory Defect & Packaging,"As soon as I opened the box I knew things were not good. The factory packaging was inadequate to protect the pump, but the worst part is that the oil fill plug installed by the factory was cross-threaded and loose resulting in a serious oil leak that saturated the box and instruction manual. A call to the factory resulted in returning the pump to Amazon; the factory rep told me that the pump was tested prior to ship, but that because of the loose oil fill plug the pump likely had water in the motor housing. Poor factory QC - Shame on Zoeller.As for the Amazon packaging - another example of poor packaging for heavy items. The factory boxed pump shucked around in the Amazon box because of inadequate box filler. This is a problem that Amazon can not grasp - it's a mystery to me - after all it's not rocket science."
4,"Strong pump, doesn't clog.","The Zoeller M57 pump is strong, clears water from my drainage system quickly. I replaced an Ace Hardware pump that, while strong, constantly clogged with Cypress needles. The M57 handles the needles and other small debris with ease. After a month of use, my only question is that the cast iron pump enclosure is showing signs of rust. That said, it would have to rust a lot to get through the heavy cast iron."
5,Works Great,My old Zoeller pump was on it's last leg so time for a new one. I like this one better than the old pedestal type that was here when I bought the house. I plan to buy another one just like it to have on hand as a backup pump.
2,Stupid FLOAT SWITCH!,"Yeah,I got this thing a little over a year ago and I have had several problems with it. The biggest problem has been the unreliable float switch. Sure,it will work well MOST of the time,but MOST of the time is not acceptable for a sump pump. You need it to work ALL the time. Mine frequently gets stuck,causing it to stay on for hours when I'm not at home or when I'm asleep at night. I'm very disappointed with this product.BTW:I did not purchase this pump through Amazon."
5,Zoeller M57 Well Designed and Easy to Install,"During Hurricane Sandy the sump pump we had in place only for four years failed due to rusting of the hardware that held the base in place. I read the reviews and the Zoeller M57 appeared to be well received from other users and the top ten rating programs for consumers. When it arrived you are immediately impressed by the durable, solid engineering design. It was quickly installed into the existing system. I hope to be as satisfied with this pump 5-6 years from now."
4,Aoeller M57 Sump Pump,Procuct has only been installed a little over a week. Appears to be handling job very easily. Quite. No problems so far.
1,Byzantine Analysis,"A Moment To Decide purports to be a careful and erudite study of the renewal movement within the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). In fact, it is neither. Its ""research"" is superficial, its analysis Byzantine, and its conclusions McCarthyesque. The only finding with which I agree is located on page 87 - ""The Forum is a driving force behind the conservative renewal movement's growing political power at PC(USA) General Assemblies ..."""
4,Unexpected treasure,"I wasn't expecting to like this series, especially as it is so close to both the television show AND the game, but this book made me laugh! I love it. I plan on buying as many Pokemon adventures as I can afford and the gang at Viz comics can put out.The book has Red visiting Lavender Town and a Pokemon gravesite. Learning that his rival, Blue, was last seen headed for the haunted tower, Red rushes off after him only to find himself battling ghosts and zombie pokemon, controlled by the evil Team Rocket. Not only that, but both Blue and his powerful Charmelean are possessed as well!Red must keep his wits about him as he tries to discover a way of saving Blue and defeating the evil in the tower.And after all that, Red meets a girl..."
4,Excellent Crime Thriller,"Not being a regular crime reader I was pleasantly surprised by this book. The Edinburgh setting helps make it unique and it was an excellent story. The criminal wasn't too hard to spot but then not too easy either. There is a lot of characterization and local historical elements which builds the story. Having said that Rebus is the quintessential (or possibly cliched) divorced, drinking, loner, cop with a heart so it is not too cerebral a read."
1,Exhausting in it's snail-like pace.,"I feel as if I have walked the length and breadth of Scotland after reading this plodding and tiresome book. The pacing is glacial. What is supposed to be an ""internet"" riddle and response game is handled as if the participants are writing letters to each other. Clues are dropped like fish and chip wrappers and then forgotten or weakly explained..or not. The climactic chase scene (SPOILER ALERT!) features an overweight, alcoholic detective lumbering after an 80-year-old senior citizen, and STILL takes up two pages! According to other reviewers, this is the weakest of the series so I will try another volume. Hopefully there will be a better story and writing than this attempt."
4,Can't go wrong with Rankin,"One of the great things about the Rebus novels is the subdued character conflicts at play underneath the plots and subplots. Not only does one come away from Rankin's work, particularly the later Rebus books, with a wonderful sense of place and atmosphere, but the characterization is so strong that even the second and third level characters are developed enough to stand on their own. The downside of this, which is unavoidable, is that the book tends to grow long in spots. That notwithstanding, the Rebus series is an excellent one. DS Siobhan Clarke has become more prominent in these books as well, and I can't help but wonder if she isn't being lined up for a series of her own."
3,"Ehh, not bad, but nothing great.","This is one of those books that you read, and after you're finished, you're not sure if you liked it or not. It wasn't great, but there is nothing really wrong with it. It wasn't boring, it didn't drag on, but it also didn't captivate you.A detective is working on a case similar to those annoying rich girl missing girl cases that randomly appears everywhere. This book explores this Scottish case, along with some internal police politics, and the lives of a few detectives. Intermingling clues concerning dolls, autopsies, and an Internet game all come together to help solve the mystery.As with any mystery, the main part is the ending, and even though not terrible, it is pretty contrived and non-climatic."
3,Quite Good,"Not really a police procedural as the book is more TV mystery genre than gritty realism. Never the less it is easy to read and entertaining. The plot involves an abduction which might be a murder set against a strange internett game and a coffin with a doll turning up near the crime scene.The author's main character Rebus is a 40+ divorced cop, drifting around the edge of alcoholism. He has a younger female sidekick who looks into the internett side of things. The main characters are drawn a little more lightly than in some detective fiction. You never sense any of the real desperation or feeling of waste as you would normally do with a person of Rebus age and circumstances.Never the less this is basically an entertainment which is well done despite the fact that the ending is a little weak."
4,The Case of Mumia Abu-Jamal,"Without commenting on his guilt or innocence this report by Amnesty International looks at the circumstances of the Mumia Abu-Jamal trial and whether it complied with basic international legal procedures and universally recognised standards of human rights. This explores the judicial bias in his trial, as well as in his appeals and whether he was given adequate legal assistance and whether his trial was conducted under fair and impartial conditions. Considering his very life depends on this being so you can imagine this is of utmost importance. The catalogue of errors and corruption of the legal process makes for shocking reading and this is a good way to get acquainted with the case of Abu-Jamal after reading of his case in various other publications. This is a short, but thoroughly engrossing read and gives an insight into `justice' in America.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,better choice available,"My original review still stands. I am amending it in the following manner:There are better translations and better introduction volumes. I would recommend Kaaren Grimstad's translation from the Icelandic text. It has benefit of being a duo language volume with the old Norse and English translation side by side and the introduction is WAY better than Byock's. Further, the translation seems smoother and more correct from the Norse.It maybe a little bit difficult to acquire but Grimstad is the volume to work with for both advanced and beginning students of this saga. It includes genealogy charts and notes.Get Byock used if you can."
3,Great Translation,"A very different book from the Niebelungenlied (a courtly epic), this book shows a much more tribal mentality and a soul of a people that is much closer to nature. It makes for interesting comparisons with other similar cultures, such as that of the American Indians. The story is mostly fable and is hard to follow, but the images are powerful. This is one of the best places to start if you are interested in any sort of ancient Norse literature."
4,Tip of the iceberg,"This book is essentially a paraphrased summary of everything involving the Volsung line that appears in either the poetic and prose Edda. It contains a number of stories about a number of family members in chronological order. This particular saga seems to have been one of Tolkien's favorites because all of the basic elements of his famous Lord of the Rings series are here. The cursed ring of power, the broken sword reforged, the corrupt line of kings with their heroic descendant, even the slaying of the dragon. Well worth the read through. VERY SIMPLE language but still entertaining."
3,Vikings behaving badly,"Courage, greed, cowardice, betrayal, and vengeance abound in the Saga of the Volsungs. Its blood-soaked deeds centered around Sigurd the dragon-slayer have fired the imaginations of medieval artists as well as more recent artists and writers such as Ricard Wagner and J. R. R. Tolkien. The first half of the story has many mythical elements, featuring frequent interference from Odin and the slaying of the dragon Fafnir. The second half is a much less supernatural tale of barbaric revenge and counter-revenge. Many of the episodes in the second section may be tied to historical events.The storytelling itself is extremely stilted, which is probably just due to the Norse style (an overly formal translation may contribute as well, but since I don't read Norse I couldn't say for sure). In my opinion, poetic renderings, some of which predate this 13th century prose version, are more enjoyable to read, but can be hard to follow if you have not first read the prose version."
2,Regrettably Bland Translation,"I have discovered that Mr. Byock's translation is regrettably bland. It appears that he translates word-for-word, which gives the English prose a clumsy, ""summarizing"" kind of a feel.The translation lacks a beautiful, flowing quality that might emerged had he tried to portray the spirit of the work through his own personal, subjective experience. Said again, he should have taken personal ""ownership"" of the story and written it in modern English according to his own inner feeling -- richly imagining the events and meaning, and then writing a faithful, but new story.Instead, he rather logically translates word-for-word, with seemingly little care for the poetic quality of the tale. Thus the reading is bulky and unimaginative.I believe that portraying one's own inner experience of a story is more ""valid"" than a scientifically-accurate rendering of it. Although the text is clear, to a fault, I was disappointed with it.I recommend a different translation."
5,Nice introduction to Icelandic Myths,"This is the first Icelandic Saga that I have read. I thought it was a good set of stories, and it has gotten me interested in reading more. As far as the translation goes, I can't say much as I am fairly ignorant on the subject. I did enjoy the prose while reading this version though. I also thought the notes throughout the text were very helpful. They were good in explaining things someone unfamiliar with this area of literature wouldn't know. They also did a good job of explaining references to other sagas. The last thing I enjoyed about the notes were explanations on passages that weren't able to be translated perfectly due to one reason or another. I didn't read the introduction, so I can't say anything on that part of the book. Overall I recommend this if you're a fan of sagas or are interested and new to them."
1,Useless,"Bought this to try and remove two hard to reach nuts on my car. The first time i went to use it the metal bars twisted, one fell out and one snapped in half. this might work for something that is very lightly tightened on. anything that is beyond hand tight this is not what you want to use."
4,Transformative indeed!,"I think that the non-religious who reads the things that Therese said and did with her sisters in community at the Lisieux Carmel may occasionally be intimidated. I know I am from time to time. Sometimes I am even confused, for there are some pieces of advice and counsel that would not do for a secular woman such as myself. But I thoroughly enjoyed this work, and the translation was superb. Through the compilation of the reminiscences, I was able to better see what it might have been like to follow Therese around, listen to her, go to her in tears, question my vocation. I am grateful for this glimpse and I believe I have a better understanding of the way Therese taught. Thanks for reading."
2,Tony Bennet in poor form,"I'm a huge Tony Bennet fan but this album disappoints. He sounds uninspired. Try his ""This is Jazz"" release for an example of his best work."
4,Moving,"I agree with the reviewer who enjoyed the maturity in Bennett's voice. I'm not a HUGE Bennett fan -- I listen widely to jazz singers, and there are others I like better -- but I was moved by several of the renditions here, particularly ""Willow Weep for Me,"" ""Good Morning Heartache,"" and ""Some Other Spring.""Now, I think that Billie Holiday OWNS these songs -- particularly the latter two -- but the age in Bennett's still-strong voice made these versions seem rich to me, especially given the exceptional way he phrases the lyrics.I too like trio settings, but the string accompaniments here are tasteful."
3,"My copy was missing pages 59 - 90, a critical part.","The copy I purchased was missing pages 59 thru 90, a critical part, and had 91 thru 122 twice. I tried to just forget the missing pages and continue, but it was impossible, to much was missing from the story. Other than the aformentioned problem, the book was very good, what I could read of it."
5,An incredible survival story,A compelling true story - how did she survive? To have done so she must be a strong woman. It must of taken a lot of courage to write this book and have to re live her past. The book made me laugh and made me cry and I also learnt a lot from it. Thank you Cheryl for sharing this. Fantastic book.
1,But EVERYONE'S life is hard,"Lots and lots and lots of people have very, very hard lives, far harder than what is described in this book. We all go around thinking we are the only ones, but I can assure you that we are not."
5,love it,"Quality is great ,This CD sounded like years gone by came back loud & clear. Prefect suprise for my holiday guest."
4,Birthstone Pups,"I bought the April Birthstone Pup made by Ganz for 10 year old Abby, who was very pleased with it. However when I went to buy a May Birthstone Pup for her brother Isaac, I found that Ganz had discontinued them. I could not find a seller on Amazon who had one either. What a shame, Isaac was very disappointed."
3,"Some good information, but thin (only 64 pages)","Human Remains, is an interesting book in that some hard data about bone length is included. The book is quite thin however, and reminiscent of a book found at a tourist gift shop."
1,worse online purchase ever,none of the songs were in order and the last song Holy Spirit reprise was missing completely. the worse experience i've had with an amazon order in all my years of buying online
3,funny lady,Funny girl much better. It's okay as a sequel. Make sure you watch funny girl first. Billy rose kids a great character.
1,This Album Sucks,"Ok, first of all, this cant be Schweisser, I bought this damn album thinking it was goign to be hard like their other albums such as Willkommen Im Club and Eisenkopf. Instead I get this half ass peace of Sh** that sucks, it freakin sounds like Blink 182. If your going to buy a Schweisser album get Willkommen Im Club, or go to a different web site and get Eisenkopf. But Schweisser is still the best band in the World!!! I think this cd is when they were just starting out or something."
5,Superior!,"This is a terrific product, vastly superior to any leak-stopping compounds available at Home Depot. It's easy to use, a little messy (you have to mix tha components for awhile by hand, not unlike softening modelling clay)and there's some odor, though not bad. But it does stop leaks. Even on a fairly major problem like mine, an old tin bathtub that has rusted out in spots, the plumbers epoxy putty fills the holes, stops the leaks and the repairs survive constant exposure to water. Once dried, the hard putty is sandable and accepts paint. Better than aspirin for a plumbing headache!"
2,"Chi Kung, Yves Requena","I was very disappointed in this book, since I ordered it based on a 5 star rating from one other reviewer. The sketches showing the various positions of the body are primitive and disconcerting, and ugly. They were so distracting I could not focus on the writing."
3,Chris Brann - Deep Fall,"Chris Brann finally appears under his own name for a album of delicious tech-house. DEEP FALL seems aptly named, judging from the title track alone with its synth washes and a single mournful modulated violin at its center. ""Eyes"" is brighter, though the beats don't lessen, and ""Calling 610"" and ""All About the Music"" inch more towards straight-up house. On the down side, however, ""Journey to the Centre"" runs a tad too long -- a bit too much self-indulgence in the piano chords, and the cooling down of ""Grey Souls"" seems aimless as well. But ""Yung Po Nee"" rides the funk in a wild way and takes out the album on a positive note, even if it ends abruptly."
2,Poor solo effort from Wamdue man,"I was really disappointed with this, mainly due to the fact that Chris Brann (Wamde Kids, Wamdue Project) is such a talented producer. But this album is so pedestrian. There is nothing on it to which you can say, 'that's very good' or 'that's innovative or different'. He just hasn't excelled himself on it. Any techno/deep house producer could knock out similar songs of a relative standard in no time.It's not that it's a bad album, it's just that I expected more of him."
3,G-D made guys so girls can flirt!,"Phyllis Reynolds Naylor is one of my favorite Authors, I adore the Alice series and I enjoy this series as well. But I think that there should be more girl guy relationships going on here if you know what I mean...Anyways I recommend this series and any other Phyllis Reynolds Naylor book because she truely is one of the only amazing authors who writes stories that teens and children can relate to. If you haven't read any of her works of genius than I suggest you start with this series..."
5,Here we go again...,"I happened upon Ms. Naylor's books through a book club and the titles sounded interesting. After reading the first 4 books aloud to my fourth grade students, I just had to buy this 5th book online! The pranks that the kids do to each other in this book continue to be filled with imagination. Thankfully, no one gets hurt because no serious harm is ever committed. If you want to understand pre-teens, this series is one to purchase!"
1,Not Appropriate,"Although some of the antics are funny and nearly harmless, many behaviors are so wrong that I told my son he had to stop reading it. For instance, the Hatford boys take revenge upon Malloy family by taking one of their daughters into their house, locking her in, and binding and gagging her. Scenes from other books show equally poor judgement.A Traitor Among the Boys"
4,Decent but theres better,"I have bought these and seismic's model, I would rather buy seismic audio's version any day. These arent welded too well and I hope they hold up."
3,IMHO ... its OK ... But there is a better product on this site,"This unit is quite functional as is and even comes with screws to facilitate mounting. I received my order well in advance of the estimated due date and in excellent condition. I would be more satisfied with it if it weren't for the fact that I also ordered a similar product from a different seller and manufacturer on Amazon which seems superior in construction and material than this one. Its just my own personal preference and observation after comparing the two units side by side. I liked the deeper seating, solid weight, heavier duty feel, the welded joints, the smoother professional finish and the counter-sunk mounting holes of the other unit so much so that I re-ordered more from the other seller and am keeping these as backups."
3,Just Ok.....,"I expected more out of this title, it was not as helpful for identifying local flora as I had hoped."
5,Sturdy and Capacious,I have been using one of these daily for over a year. I stuff each compartment with supplements every day and it just keeps on working.
5,SIMPLY DIFFICULT,"This is music both durable and fragile. Voiced principally with acoustic instruments, the pieces exhibit an unashamed electronic sensibility. Sourced traditionally and assembled with an ear bent to the subtle use of an open loop as an undercurrent and organizing principal, the sounds set into motion within a stage made hazy by layered decays then defined with sharply etched phrases that coalesce, dissolve and remerge in new but still related configurations. A timeless sound, perhaps slightly reminiscent of the acoustically-based pieces featured on Sewn by Mountains, Solo Andata intimates some jazz touches but the overall quality is open to the air, open to the time, free of extant genre. Pulling off such seemingly spontaneous, seemingly self-organizing pieces is a remarkable feat, made all the more compelling by an insistence to learn to listen music free of the mutilation of Categorisation."
4,Jet Mini Lathe is a Solid Machine,"I got a new Jet Mini Lathe for Christmas. I have only turned one small, lidded box, thus far. Already, I love the lathe! The lathe is extremely quiet, smooth-running and well-built. It has plenty of power for its capacity. Well, the lathe isn't perfect. I would prefer the on-off switch to be on the left side and I would rather have the Jet's belt-changing access door located on the front of the machine, but neither of these minor ergonomic shortcomings would keep me from buying the lathe. Now, if Jet only built a lathe with the Mini's quietness, smoothness and quality and with a 24""swing and a bed length of 42"" or so, they would dominate the woodturning lathe market. No question about it!"
3,strictly a reference book,"The book was printed in 1943. Its owner is almost certainly dead by now. And the book has been long out of print. There appears to have been no more recent edition after 1943.The book is a reference of various lists of surviving Bede manuscripts. Looks like much work went into assembling these lists. Though maybe the author was able to get help from lists drawn up by earlier historians.Anyway, if an updated edition is ever contemplated, these days it might be more fruitful to put it out as a set of webpages. Or as a reference CD. Yes, there is certainly still a demand and need for physical books. But for reference texts like this one, where there is little actual textual commentary, then those newer formats make more sense."
5,Excellent,I love this book it has many stains and well read and used. When is the next one comming out!
3,Wanted more.,"I wanted more from this book. It may be because the book concentrates on one region of China, but I thought the recipes were all very similar. I did, however, enjoy reading the stories of Mrs. Chiang's growing up in China. I would be interested in seeing what this book would look like if it were updated, since lots of items are now more readily available than when the book was originally published."
5,Very Nice,"This is probably the best handheld you are going to be able to buy today. I had some real problems with my Jornada, and my nephew complains alot about his casio and how he wants a new pda. I honeslty have to say, this is an incredible handheld. If you are deciding what pda to buy and need more info, go to compaq.com and take a look at their visual tour of their new ipaq. The only complaint I have is that if your going to save up and buy something this expensive and nice, just remember that it will be replaced by newer, fast, and more powerful models. Overall, this is the number one handheld to own today."
4,Great but do your homework first,"Hi. This is a great device. If you are in the market for a monochrome PDA then this could be the one for you. However, if you see something that says ""paper white"" diplay, don't believe it! This device has an LCD (grey/green) screen. Being that it has a higher resolution then any of the Palm mono devices it looks quite good. But it is not ""white"" in any way. Also, the 16meg of memory can be used very quickly if you add more programs to this unit. The bundle with the CF expansion is a good idea. Then just shop for the best price on a 64meg CF and you would be all set. If you are still interested after reading this then, GO FOR IT!"
3,Battery life is poor,This is a great machine as long as you can plug it in and recharge frequently. I took it on a short trip abroad and the battery went very quickly (life is only five days when not used according to the website!) and it emptied all the settings I had put in. This makes it very impractical compared to something like the Psion or Revo
1,Disappointed,"My business partner and I both bought one. Mine immediately crashed and had to be returned. Hers waited a few weeks, crashed once and lost all data. It crashed a second time and it wouldn't work. We both thought it was great-----while it worked! Good definition, fairly quick response, good audio. We did have a little trouble syncing but that may have been due to the other problems. It is much too pricey to have such bugs. Neither of us had it working long enough to fairly review all the options. Too bad."
2,Energy Crisis,"The iPAQ is a great machine if you only need to use it a few minutes here and there. Anything more requires frequent recharging. There's no going on business trips without the charger. Frankly, for the price I expected better. The screen is pretty, but I can't say I'm thrilled with the tradeoff... I'd rather use a monochrome device that still has juice when it's needed. It's embarrassing to whip out this hi-tech gadget only to have to borrow a scrap of paper to write down a phone number.I'm sticking with it for now, but I'm definitely on the look out for something that suits my needs better. Toshiba has just announced a Pocket PC that might be worthwhile if the battery life beats the iPAQ, Palm is planning on moving to more powerful ARM processors, and Compaq itself will have to keep on the move to compete.For now, if you're looking for a handheld that'll fit in your pocket and run all week on a charge, you'll need to look elsewhere."
3,hard to read the screen,"This is a good value, but the screen is very difficult to read in less than perfect lighting conditions. Under bright flourescent lights in the office, it is fine. The rest of the time, though, I have a heck of a time with it. The internal memory also isn't really big enough to store MP3s. I decided to go back to paper and pen."
4,Why I still like this PDA,"I bought this model in 2001 and still use it every day. It is reliable and has lots of software built in. I've added List Pro and Pocket Quicken. The only problems I've had are that the screen has gotten badly scratched, and I can't get the Compact Flash Jacket to read my digital photos."
5,Bye bye Palm,"After using a Palm for over two years, I was given a IPAQ to use. I never really like Windows CE much, but after using it for a few days, I LOVE IT! I can't wait till I can upgrade the OS to 2002 next month."
2,Not bad,"Eye-catching, very futuristic look. But it is too fancy. I seldomly play games or listen to mp3. The battery life is horrible...."
4,The best,"I have had other Handhelds, this is by far the best, It's fast, and very nice looking. I bought it with the past Pocket PC OS and upgrade it to Pocket PC 2002, it works perfect. As far as I can tell this is the only one that can support the upgrade because of the Intel Risc processor it uses. For me this was the best option in order no to carry my laptop around."
1,"Sadly, mine has a Memory Stacking Error, Causing it to Crash","I loved this device when I first got it.Alas, it has developed (1 month past warranty, of course)a memory stack and usage error, such that the entireprogram memory slowly gets filled, even when all programsare shut down. Eventually, it runs out of memory, and themachine crashes, requiring the machine to be reset. It isentirely unrelated to any add-ins running (I uninstalledthem all). Honestly, I can't tell if this is an iPAQ erroror a Microsoft operating system error (it is vaguely reminiscentof an Excel error a few years back), but it makes no differenceto me, as the result is the same. I am off to buy a Sharp Zaurux (w/ Linux and a keyboard), to ensure this never happens again."
4,pope likes it,"The compaq PDA sitting on my desk is useful, and cumbersome at the same time. I like the crisp display and easy navigation tools, but don't like the depth when the CF expansion jacket is on. I use the 3650 mostly for scheduling, reminders, reading books, music, and maps (I travel). I still don't get how anyone could do any real spreadsheet work or document review using the pocket excel and word software. The user input (8 position ""joystick"") is fairly easy once you get used to it. The writing recognition works pretty well once you teach yourself to write by its rules. Definitely easier for me than trying to type on the virtual keyboard. I'm still looking for a folding keypad like the palms have, but no luck so far. All in all, I'm glad I bought it."
2,Buy the Illustrated Guide to Snowboarding instead.,"This book is decent, but the Illustrated Guide to Snowboarding is a much more in-depth and well written book. It is also more entertaining with funny drawings and tips. This book really only skims the surface on all the areas you need to start snowboarding."
5,(no title),"This book is great for begginers and also explains advanced tricks and techniques like methods, spins, cliff drops, carving and explains a little about racing and competative snowboarding. It also gives you usefull info like what to eat before you go, warm-ups, getting on and off chairlifts, ect."
4,The book was great.,I really liked the book The Complete Snowboarder. It is full of a lot of useful information on how to get started snowboarding. It explains not only the basics but also how to do tricks. I would recommend this book to anyone who has even the slightest interest in snowboarding because once they read it they won't be able to wait for the snow to fall.
5,Snowboarding at it purest,"I really got alot out of this book, if you want to save yourself a beating on the run's this is for you!"
5,Audiophile,I bought this CD at The Standard Hotel while I was staying there. It's really great background music (keeps you moving but it's not distracting) and I was actually looking on Amazon.com to see if there were any more by The Standard's DJ Nasir. This is for audiophiles who need to hear something NEW! I highly recommend!
1,try another,It appears that some of the information in this guide is dated. A travel guide is only useful if the information is up to date.
5,HOTTIE,"Mr. Stachura, I have two words for you: Gor geous. You are the most handsome author of golf courses that I have ever laid my eyes on. If you ever lose that wife of yours, please be sure to call me."
2,you could get all these ideas with a few short hourrs online,We really didn't use this that much. Kids just weren't interested. Not even sure where it is now...
2,"Has good ideas, but too simple.","Not much of a challenge would these games give any kid. Most of these games you could probably play sitting in your window. The card games aren't fun except the football games and the rest of the games are easily ""think-upable"". If you really wanna have fun on the road, either bring a cell phone and talk to your friends or count something. It's much better than spending money on this!"
2,Cool but not wicked cool,"I waited for quite some time for this book to come out, but I ended up being a little dissapointed. I love Loretta Lux, but I know this is not a full compilation of her work and I feel like many of my favorites were left out. Maybe she's saving them up for ""Volume 2""."
3,more technology than art,"time will tell if this book is a one hit wonder or a classic, but it is certainly a popular topic of art speak. digitally created, i should say that it isn't really photography at all, and beyond that it's not terribly interesting to look at."
5,One of my favorites,"My review:Each page gives you a standard portrait or a child, but something isn't quite right. The children look normal, and yet other-worldly. Their faces, heads, expressions are pleasant, yet unsettling. This is definitely a book you can return to over and over again. The color, print quality, and book build are all fantastic.My wife's review:This book is creepy. Get it away from me."
2,moderately interesting cash-in,"While some of the interviewees have compelling ideas about Bruce's music, this pseudo-documentary is low-rent and not terribly informative (especially if you have read the Marsh text). Bruce's ""participation"" is limited to minimal footage from an interview he gave backstage circa-""Darkness"" (my guess). Instead of revealing content, you have has-been after has-been telling tired stories about their brush with greatness. Tinker, in particular, drinks openly during his self-serving responses--hardly a flattering presentation considering his legitimate role in growing Springsteen's regional fame. As the previous reviewer pointed out, the absence of Springsteen's music only adds to the tedium. Granted, for die-hards, there is a certain thrill involved with anecdotal info, no matter how trivial. But anybody else would be better served by Marsh's book or any number of actual interviews that Springsteen has given over the years."
2,Skip it,"Cheap doccumentary, that's the truth here.At least it's a honest merchandise, because it makes it clear that this is totally unauthorized. By saying that, you know for sure that there will be no Bruce's original music nor any interviews with E-Street Band actual members."
1,TOO MUCH MONEY FOR WAY TOO LITTLE CONTENT,Dont waste your time or money. The best way to learn these techniques is from a real drummer. Pictures dont really help and this book is nothing more than a waste of paper and trees.DONT BUY
4,Disappointed - NOT,"The Book - Leave out chapter 5 (10 pages dedicated to humor) saving the trees needed to print this section. Author needs to ""stick"" to the subject. Some of the pictures are hard to follow. On the + side the the large print in the ""at a glance"" chapter and the hand map are very usefull.The DVD - VERY WELL DONE! - makes up for any shortcomings in the book - work great together."
5,Pleased,"I really wanted to see if what I had learned long ago could be easily explained. To my surprise this book was right on target. Easy to follow, excellently demonstrated, and made quite simple. As in anything that looks easy...practice divides the can from the can't."
1,Embarrassingly bad,"Contrary to his other works on famous cities, Ackroyd's book and now, much much much worse, this DVD is among the most vapid and terrible documentaries I have ever seen.The pictures bear no relationship to the narration about 50 percent of the time and the same footage is used in episode after episode.Do not buy this."
4,"Worth the price just to see La Fenice, restored!","This is an excellent series to gain basic knowledge of Venice. I've searched for several years for a documentary that shows La Fenice, in detail. For that reason alone, this series surpassed my expectations. It's well photographed and very good. My only major complaint is the sound balance - I listened to the DVD's both through a stereo system and through a 5.1 sound system. In both cases, the music drowned out much of the dialogue - so I missed some of the commentary. Also - I REALLY didn't need to see footage of the stiff looking Peter Ackroyd, limping around Venice!"
5,i like matt christopher books,The Hitaway Kid is about a boy that loves baseball. Barry is the hit away kid. Barry plays left field. he almost caught a ball.
2,Not made to last,"I have had this drive for a year and a half, and it has started making loud vibrating noises when I turn it on. I think it's heading south. I can't recommend it."
3,Glass Fishihng Floats,"The colors were great, but I have some not shown. The descriptions for Oriental floats was not as complete as I expected. An up date would be good or one for each area of floats would allow descriptions of more floats. $15.00 is a high for what it is although I do not find the presentation necessarily false. I was simply expecting one thing and got something a great deal less. I accept this as my goof not the fault of the seller."
2,not impressed,"i was not impressed with this book. the plot was a big mish mash. there was too much going on as far as action, and the plot was weak and the characters half baked. i had to read this for my book club and i feel i wasted a lot of time with a book that left me flat. not even the ending was interesting."
1,Eye-rolling groaner for any woman with a sex life,"Picked it up this year when it made several best-of-the-century lists and slogged my way through it, hoping it would get better. It didn't. Poe could have done the first 3rd of the book in 3 pages. Nor did I find the riddles engaging.I found it to be a adolescent male fantasy unredeemed by any but the shallowest reflection.Romance - I don't think so. I, who long to see the Greek Isles, found no charm in the descriptions.Relationships - Not. The only relationships in the book are with one's self. There was no honest communication with another in the entire novel. Was that the point?The novel suffers terribly from its 1960's setting. Yea, I know it was post-war, but it has 1960's all over it."
2,rip off,This book was old and why did it end up costing me $11? I could have bought a new one in good shape. Bad.
1,This book is CRAP!,"Alright, I had to read this for class, and at first I was excited, because all of the other books we read in the class were amazing. This being the last book we read, I thought it would be the best. WRONG!!! It makes no sense! It is total crap, especially the last chapter. If it had ended with chapter 61, I would have been fine with it. I think Nicolas would have turned out alright then. But no, it didn't, and now he's messed up. I am telling all of my friends to NOT read this book because it is a waste of time!"
4,"5am, blanket over your head, kinda book","The reviewers below said it; this is an utterly gripping bookwhich you continue to read whilst you should be at work/class/in bed.The characters are beguiling and fascinating and you really have no idea what is going to happen next. The ending, however, makes me think that the author had a pressing engagement just as he was about to finish the book; it made me think of school time stories of ""...and suddenly I woke up"". That aside, it is definately worth reading...a fabulous book."
3,Between Love and Hate,"My review title refers equally to some of the themes of the novel as well as the other reviews which have been posted here. It seems that people who read this book either love it and feel that it's life-altering in some way, or hate it and see it as a total waste of time. I happen to fall somewhere in between: I enjoyed the narrative style and was captivated linguistically as well as intellectually... right up until the end. Unfortunately, I feel the pay off wasn't worth the effort and at the end of the game I was left feeling more exhausted than enlightened. I have a feeling that your loving or hating of this book is entirely dependent on whether you are able to fully identify with the narrator - a man I felt very ambiguously about.The quote in the end reminds me of another open-to-entepretation ending of another novel - ""The Name of the Rose."" I'd strongly recommend ""The Name of the Rose"" over ""The Magus""."
2,Not for me,"I really disliked this book, which I found longwinded, pretentious, fraudulant and in the end silly. But I'm unreasonably bitter towards it since I stopped enjoying it inside the first hundred pages, yet continued to struggle through the remaining 500 or so pages towards the ending.Nonetheless, I know a lot of people who loved this book. They were more accepting then I was of the themes of space- and time-travel and mind-expansion that the novel touches on...If you are interested in a clever novel of ideas and history, and can put up with a lot of trickiness and would-be profoundity from the author, then you might enjoy this book. Just try to remember that ""The Magus"" is neither as clever nor as profound as it thinks it is."
1,first book this year I couldn't make myself finish,"I didn't care about the characters. The plot dragged intolerably. I always finish books, but just couldn't do it with this one."
5,A magical story of manipulation of the mind and emotions,"I will probably read this book again. It caught my attention early and kept it until the end, although it left me with many unanswered questions. Some of his scenes are the most sensual, without being pornographic, that I have read. Obviously Fowles is an atheist who tried to instill in his readers that the ""godgame"" was justified since it helped transform an egotistical and inmature young man into something better. Those of us who believe in one true and loving God may have a hard time in accepting the demonic pleassure that Conchis and his cohorts obtained by demoralizing and humiliating a fellow human being. If their intentions were so honorable, then why did they leave their victim drugged to wake up with a loaded revolver by his side? But if Fowles intention was to make his readers take an introspective look, he succeeded and told an interesting story at the same time."
5,By no means is this an ordinary novel,"I saw the movie, on tv, as a child (1972). Didn't understand a word of it, but the images never left my mind. Three years ago, I googled ""Michael Caine"" and ""Anthony Quinn"", and finally got the title. I quickly ordered the DVD, then ordered the first edition book soon after.On first try, I found the book to be verbose. Tossed it in the ""for free"" box at the apartment complex. Three days later, I fished it right back out. Spent the next three weeks reading 25-50 pages a night.It is verbose, and the thousands of sub-references are both obscure and esoteric (but that's where Google come in handy). It is also highly disjointed, with chapters focused on minor, one-time characters which seemingly arc off into wild tangents. And many a snail-paced scene seems to drag on for pages...So why did I find myself reading it? Because I was Nicholas then, and am Maurice now!"
3,Very bizarre,"A deeply spun, mysterious novel. From near the beginning it has you wondering what could possibly be transpiring. You would think that, as such, it would also be a page-turner but it wasn't. Strangely, the novel also either completely fools the reader or changes its own mind along the way as to its own genre (from time/location travel to psychology). I loved the inconclusiveness of the ending, it felt right. However, there is one loose end I'd like tied up if someone else caught it: What is the second commandment to which De Seitas alludes?"
1,\Overly wordy and pretentious writing,I almost quit reading this book several times but kept going because I thought it would finally make sense. It did not. The writing was terrible. Where wad the editor?
5,An Oddyssey,"Wow. I just finished, and my head is still swimming. It was only by virtue of my tiny attention span that I was able to put it down at all. Fowles' prose is beautiful, lyrical--I wanted to underline the whole novel--and he tells a story that is by turns identical to and entirely unlike any I have ever encountered. That is, he encorporates just enough archetype and just enough spice to produce one of the most arresting pieces of literature I have ever encountered. Truly a masterpiece."
5,Pack your bags; you're going to Greece!,"If ever a dream submitted to an author's will, it has happened in ""The Magus"". John Fowles, with a superb command of place and of time, imbeds stories-within-stories amid a complicated plot, and the result is breath- taking. If ever one hears one's self stumbling to define ""magic realism"", think of the stars over Phraxos, think of ouzo and the caice that will not return for a fortnight, and then do not insist on definition. ""The Magus"" is full of boundless energy woven in a superior narrative."
1,Deplorable,"After hearing so much about Fowles' masterpiece, I plodded through the first few chapters with the hope that I would reach the final chapter feeling rewarded and satisfied. Enlightened,even. I wasn't.What has disturbed me on so many levels, months after shelving the book, is the assumption that Nicholas' punishment fit his ""crime.""Not once did I get the impression that he was madly in love with Allison and not once did I feel that she was somehow entitled to his love. Are we obligated to love every needy, fragmented, and troubled individual who enters our lives and professes to feel true love for us? Is it justifiable for a woman to conspire to torture a man, both mentally and physically, because he leaves her?Throughout the book, I pitied Nicholas and abhorred Allison. In the end, when the legion of psychopaths had finally managed to brainwash Nicholas into thinking that Allison was - alas - his one true love, I was struck by a wave of nausea. The premise? Deplorable."
3,"maybe if you pronounce it 'Mr. Magoo', it makes sense.","This book was too long, although enthralling. However, I kept expecting some sort or resolution, salvation, rebirth, etc. in Urfe, and it turns out he's still the same as he has been all along. The end left me disappointed, sort of like eating cotton candy - sure it's big and fluffy, but when you bite down there's hardly any substance... Try Ayn Rand's Fountainhead."
2,Beware the Waiting Room,"I felt rather cheated upon the completion of this novel. I felt I'd been taken advantage of by having to slog through 656 pages to get to such a weak and anemic ending. Don't get me wrong the writing is rather engaging, however, the PLOT is so long and convuluted it isn't worth the time I invested in the book. In my edition, in the preface, the author even discloses (In so many words) that he never really cared much for this novel, nor understood peoples' ardent love of it. I can understand that.Upon finishing the book I went to see how other people reviewed it and was pleasantly surprised that many had the same reaction that I did. I then realized I was on Amazon UK so then switched over to Amazon US. To my dismay American readers had nothing but GREAT reviews for this mediocre novel. So much for American sensibilities. It appears that we are still nothing more than a cultural colony of England. In literature at least."
1,SAD AND REPULSIVE,"I picked this book up at my local Chapters Bookstore because I recognized the name John Fowles - an ex-boyfriend had taken me to see the movie ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" many years before. I needed some distraction and was hoping to escape into a good story (a fire had recently been set in my apartment building). What a mistake!!! I found this book to be a repulsive exercise in sado-masochism. I felt physically ill at times while reading the descriptions of the cruelty inflicted upon the book's protagonist - the point of which seemed at the book's resolution to be coercing him into resuming a relationship with his ex-girlfriend. Profoundly creepy and disturbing."
1,Overrated,"This book is just full of literary pretentiousness. The book starts off well, but there are too many plots, too many twists, too much storytelling that goes on for pages, and the ending is definitely anticlimatic. Overall, its a disappointing read."
2,"Fat, filler, ballast, chaff. Some wheat.","Too many words, Mr. Fowles! And you ain't Mozart. I don't quite recall a text so larded with mediocre word-painted landscapes or dead-nature pieces. Must we know the condition of every piece of vegetation in the 100-yard radius, and the appearance of every item of clothing worn by nameless characters? There may be a decent short story hiding beneath all that, although, as the author started hammering out his message in the ""trial"" scene, I saw only a strained attempt at Jungian shrink-work, not at all a sharp and relevant choice about human freedom. Read this, if you care, for its few psychological insights, and a few memorable characterizations. The plot, the moral vision, and the prose all are negatives, I believe. Now, Master and Margarita is a different story..."
5,Suprisingly Good,This was a wonderful book and I am sorry to say that I was reluctant to read it. I'm glad I did. This book kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next.
1,An attempt at heaviness that shouldn't fool anyone,"This is one of the worst books I've read in 20 years. Maybe the symbolism and mysticism were too heavy for my intellect. Then again, maybe I demand that authors possess the basic skills to render complicated subjects comprehensible and, at the very least, readable. I can picture Fowles grinding out this piece of pretentious tripe utterly convinced that he was fashioning a work of depth and mystery. Nope. He produced a book devoid of engaging plot lines, interesting characters or believable scenes. If you loved Carlos Castaneda's ""Don Juan"" series, this is the book for you. Don't be fooled into thinking it's a great book because it leaves you baffled. That's the mark of a poor book, not a good one."
4,The Magus,"F. Scott Fitzgerald once described himself as the best second rate writer in the world. Of John Fowles, Martin Amis wrote in 'The War Against Cliche' that he is a middlebrow writer who sometimes hopes he is a highbrow. The difference is Fitzgerald wasn't equating second rate with middlebrow.I wouldn't put Fowles in the same category as a writer but as an idea novelist he warrants some merit for creating this original and ambitious psychodrama. Even when he employs artifice, Fowles is creative and imaginative. His descriptions of the islands of Greece are impressive.I recommend the hardcover Modern Library edition by Random House. It contains the new 1998 author's Introduction."
1,This book is a Roller Coaster Ride up a Mesa,"The entrance of Conchis is stunning, confusing. The inventiveness of the situation occuring on Phraxos makes one unable to put the book down, as a single question burns. ""Why is the millionaire staging such a costly and elaborate event?"" Is there a connection with time travel, other worlds, or another particular reason he must do this? The rollercoaster keeps moving UP and UP...... ....AND WE NEVER FIND OUT WHY! I invested a weekend in this baby, after seeing it featured on the Amazon front page. I don't think this book warranted the rave...neuh neuh neuh!"
5,You hate it or like it - but you'll read it all!,"I noticed something when I read the reviews... people either hate it or love this book.However: I noticed something interesting: even the ones who said they HATED it had one thing in common: they all read it from COVER to COVER! Makes you think, doesn't it?"
1,668 Pages of Blah Blah Blah !!,"Arrogant, self-important, self-absorbed, delusional jerk goes to Greece, gets caught in a mystery, and finally learns punish people who wrong him. My question is: Who cares about any of these situations or characters? They are all ludicrous and mean. This book was highly recommended but turned out to be a waste of time, don't bother."
2,Definitely not a classic!,"The book was not horrible, I guess. Maybe if I hadn't had any expectations before starting it, I would have appreciated it more. But then again, maybe not. It does say on the back cover that this is considered a modern classic, which makes me despair about the quality of modern literature. The story is inprobable, the psychological analysis is mediocre. The book would have worked better with the original title, ""The Godgame"", which would at least provide a motive for the long 680 pages of reading. In other words, it would have explained from the start that I was going to witness the game played by rich, spoiled people with a lot of time on their hands. I don't watch soap, and this is hardly any better. If you're looking to read a classic, this is a waste of time. If distraction is what you're after, then it's an OK book."
2,"Too long, no ending.","1) Too long. Specifically, an unnecessary detour into Nazi torture horrors, after 600 pages a whole new girlfriend relationship that doesn't amount to anything.2) Unresolved problems.3) No Ending."
2,So...what he's trying to say is...,"At times compelling, intriguing, and down right scary, the story is one worth telling. But is it worth reading? Although the prose was beautiful, it was too often bogged down at the worst times. Whenever Nick would find a clue or find himself in trouble, I'd get so excited and read on and on, but all of a sudden find myself reeling in heavy handed interior monologue. I've been told these rambling thoughts and run on descriptions are simply the author's way of showing the character's immaturity. Fine, but I started to get annoyed with Nick, and soon I wanted him tied up, flogged, and feathered. I found him to be a very weak foil used to point out human weakness; any well conceived character would've had a clue by the first 200 pages to hoist up the white flag and call it a day. For that matter the reader should too, or else skim the first 150 pages, read 100, skim 100, read some more to catch on, skim a bit, and then read the last five."
2,You're better off with Shakespeare,"If you want to read a book about a genius/lunatic living on an island with his beautiful female companions, and the mind games he plays with the lesser mortals who happen his way, then go and read ""The Tempest"".Aside from being a much more cogent work, it's a hell of a lot shorter than ""The Magus""."
3,"intriguing and fascinating labyrinth, but way too long...","I was fascinated by the story, the godgame and Jungian psychology, and the question about election by hazards, and judgment so on and so forth, but....the twists and labyrinth go on way too long and become very mundane after about 450 pages and lose all the magic and eventually turn into a waiting game for the end which actually never comes. I liked his other books but this one was challenging and disappointing."
2,Huh?,"This book is so annoying. It makes no sense. It gets 2 stars rather than 1 only because it IS interesting. Its like watching a train wreck. Sure, its disgusting and a total horror, however you can't pry yourself away. You get lured in by the promise of a nice story then you get stomped ALL OVER THE LAST 100 PAGES!"
2,Disappointment,"Personally, I thought the book was not worth reading. Parts of the book were in another language with no translations, the ending was disappointing, and I had the feeling there was supposed to be some kind of a point to the whole thing but found none."
3,Twists and turns,Reading this book is like going on a mad roller coaster ride. It will twist you and spin you all over the place.
5,Why I read books,"Although chilling, this book is a good answer when people ask me why I am majoring in English Literature. Complex but followable, beautiful and horrific, this book is a semblance of all that I respect in Literature."
5,A Brilliant Classic,"The Magus is one of my favorite books of all time. It has everything one could wish for in a work of fiction. Beautifully written, atmospheric, sophisticated, mysterious, it is destined to be a classic for the ages. I first read this book 20 years ago and just recently read it again. It was even more captivating the second time around. It's hard to believe this novel was written in the 1950s; it holds a timeless fascination. I envy anyone who is reading it for the first time. Prepare yourself for a thrill."
1,Not for me,"The very first pages had me thinking, ""Hmm, this is pretty well written"". Into the second half of the book I began to get frustrated with it. Some parts I liked. But it got to the point where I kept on reading just to find out what the hell this story, this book, was all about. At one point, things got so ludicrous, I was thinking ""What the hell am I reading?"". And the ending, when I finally got to it, left me dissatisfied and feeling deceived, and I was not altogether surprised by that.This is a book which sets you up, makes you wonder what is going on, keeps you turning the pages in search of answers, and essentially repeats this pattern ad nauseum, dragging you on, until, at long last you reach the end of the book, with nothing at all explained. A literary wild goose chase.I have a tendency to keep most books I've read, but this one is easily going to a second-hand bookstore. I felt the book and the author wasted my time."
4,Taken again,"After a few decades, I picked this book up again to re-read. What a master storyteller. It was just hard to put down. Now I need to revisit some other Fowles books that have been sitting on the shelf. This book is like an old friend I had forgotten about."
2,A Tour-de-force of Prolixity,"That many of the Amazon reviewers rated this book as a masterpiece makes me worry about the state of literary taste. Fowles does very well in evoking the Greek islands and their inhabitants, but his tale--I suppose it is supposed to be a moral tale of the punishment of a cad--tangles itself up. Fowles impressed me as unable to find a denouement and to have contrived in the last section to obfuscate that problem with bizarre, Jungian flim-flam. The book I found interesting segmentally; as a whole it did not succeed for me."
5,Mysterious and Seductive,"I read The Magus four years ago, at age 20, and I am still trying to convince others of it's greatness. In the grand tradition of Dostoyevsky, it is a novel which delves into the human psyche, without losing any of the strength of the story. The novel is both seductive and enthralling. One of the great masterpieces of the 20th century."
3,"interesting and different, but perhaps too long.","this story of intrique, suspense and betrayal is beautifully written. the prose style is typical of fowles: poetic and lyrical. an intriguing story of a man in search of his soul, the meaning of love. however, the story loses momentum as it sometimes becomes too long and static. the reader's attention can be lost at times in the slower passages.overall, well written, inspiring; but could be shorter."
4,An irrestistably seductive tale. It will haunt you.,"Fowles uses fantasy and romance not to enchant, but to ensnare, and then he confronts and challenges. Words that come to mind upon reflecting on The Magus are exotic, fantastic and outlandish. Fowles is unlike any other writer I have ever read in his ability to weave an intelligent and singularly mysterious tale. An extraordinary read."
5,"Excellent, but less so the second time round","I first read The Magus when I was 21 and it was the best book I had read up to that point. Last year I re-read it (age 29), and while I still enjoyed it greatly, it felt a little contrived. Any one else out there read this a second time after a long interlude?"
2,"Helpful, but incomplete.","I was very excited to discover and buy this book, but once I received it I was rather dissapointed. It does have quite a bit of information, but I find that it really is missing a lot. For example, there are absolutely no references given for all the supposed results of studies, and those ""results"" are mostly very brief summaries or interpretations by the author. In addition, some of the entries list a brief or confusing definition which leaves you knowing no more than you did before you read it.I would find this book much more helpful if it really was written more like a dictionary - with pronunciation keys, simple, clear definitions, and most of all, a significant increase in the amount of information on studies."
1,Not so useful,"This book is aimed at ppl who're on the brink of understanding what toxins and allergic substances are contained within foods. After reading the reviews, I realised that you when you're severely allergic to foodstuffs, then it's not an axe to grind - it's pertinent facts you need.And sadly, this is what the book lacks. It's more a P.R. book of why the government legally poisons our food with enhancers and food colorings - to make them more appealing...This book is a good read for beginning information - but if you need real sources of allergies, there is abundant data freely available on the internet.Don't listen to publicity - listen to allergy sufferers.thanks for the information about citrus - I'm cutting that one out of my diet now. :os"
3,Project's are generally bad.,"I have yet to hear a ""project"" album that is good. The main reason why people call their albums ""projects"" is that they know they are bad and want to say ""hey, this is just a little project I have been working on"". This album is no exception."
4,Excellent product,This laptop is top shelf product works flawlesly and excellent for small busniess. I would recomend this laptop too anyone. No complants.
5,good as always,"does what it says, genuine cartridges are the best.We've tried many over the years and without fail fake cartridges mess up the printer.This is genuine and works well lasts a long time."
4,Interesting Read,"I bought Five Seasons of Angel: Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Discuss their Favorite Vampire (Smart Pop Series) because I wanted to know where Joss got his inspiration for Jasmine, Season 4's villian? I thought she was Oprah, ha. But two authors gave their opinions and I was not satisfied with them. So, overall, I enjoyed the book because it had some trivia that I didn't know as well as some unusual takes on the show's story arcs and themes."
3,Miss leading photo,"Just received my order. Thought there was 4 in a packet and I was getting as cheap price for 4 of them. Instead, there was only 1 in the packet. The photo of 4 connectors is misleading. The description doesn't point out that the price is for a single connector."
5,Stop Light for Run-On,Pretty easy to install. Replaced original part at a much lower price than Kohler's. Run-on stopped.Takes an extra couple minutes to completely shut-off but then it does. I'm not sure if that's due to this part or something else.
2,Not Quality Stuff But Did the trick.,"This product is very cheaply made out of weak plastic. When installing, the plastic that goes inside of rubber hose connection broke. I had to use Crazy Glue to fix it so it wouldn't leak."
1,Product Doesn't Work Properly,"Product sent was not product that was pictured. Replacement continuously leaks and fails. Poor quality. Unfortunately, waited too long to ask for a refund. Kept thinking I could get it to work. Don't purchase."
5,Excellent mustard with a nice KICK!,"My co-workers introduced me to this mustard, and I love it. Problem was, our local grocery store chain stopped carrying it shortly thereafter. People felt so strongly about this mustard that they got together and order cases of it now and then, just so we can keep our supplies up. How many condiments do you know of that can cause that kind of ruckus? :)It's a decent mustard with just the right amount of horseradish kick to it. I'm not a fan of 5 alarm hot stuff products, but this one seems to strike just the right balance; not too mild, but not overpowering, either. Great on many red meats and the like."
4,"Nice toy, too bad about bass","This is a nice desk toy. It works really well, I like tappin out the drum parts to my favorite songs with this. The earphone jack cord is a little small and the bass/cymbal pad is dumb because it would be nice to have the bass by itself but it was worth the price anyway."
3,Selections are by no means in sinc with the essential Stylis,More commercial than I would have liked. The Stylistics were more about change than the comfort of Nat Cole or ELLINGTON Standards. I don't expect ham in a Kosher restaurant.
5,freedom train,"The book I read was called freedom train. It was about harriet tubman trying to escape. An one day she found a tunnel that lead to Canada. Happy as she was she went to tell everyone. and they were free!and also this book made me feel I could do something too. Because when she caped on saying I can do it!And she never gave up!I will reccomand this to my friends because I hope they will enjoy the things she did,And feel the same way I felt."
5,came on time,"got her quickly, it is on my son's AR list for school, he has not read it yet and has not yet taken the AR test"
2,Freedom Train: A Boring Book About A Slave,"This isn't a very good book. It might be good if you're in love with history and you like reading 'Harriet freed slaves. She took them to Canada.' over and over again. Someone would read this and think Harriet Tubman was boring. If this is Harriet Tubman's life, then my life is cool. In other words,beware. This book is only for school reports. I wouldn't say this is a good book by any means. It's like being in slavery when you're reading this. I'd do math homework before this even crossed my mind."
5,Presentation is excellent. Subject matter is unforgettable.,"In 1960, at age 13, I read a book by Dorothy Sterling, and I recall the title being ""Slave Train."" The synopsis of ""Freedom Train"" seems to match what I remember. If they are indeed the same book, I can only say I was deeply impressed by this work and have never forgotten it. Bravo! Dorothy Sterling for keeping the youth of our nation aware of the greatness of Harriet Tubman!"
4,This book is one of my fondest childhood memories!,"When I was between the ages of 9-14..., I read this book at least 8 times. It was one of my all-time favorite books, and when I was still in the role-playing stage, I loved to pretend that I was Harriet Tubman and go sneaking around the house imagining I was leading a troop of former slaves to freedom!...I have always thought of Harriet Tubman as a great woman and a hero, and this is the only book I've read on her life. It is exciting, riveting reading...When my younger brothers and sisters grew old enough to read it, it became one of their favorites too, and our old paperback edition was literally read and read until it fell to pieces! That's why I logged on to Amazon.com today... we finally had to throw away our old copy, it's fallen apart into about 5 pieces and there are parts missing, and I wanted to order a new copy! But when I saw that ridiculous review, I couldn't stay silent! This is a GREAT book, I heartily recommend it."
5,helen,"Loved this book. Carol Bishop is a fine artist and art historian, great depth of architectural knowledge. The photographs are stellar."
2,Way Too Small!,I know this is suppose to be small for small dogs. But the picture is misleading on the size. I was disappointed it is way too small it is almost hard to even put my fingers through the holes and I have small hands. I guess it will do the job. Not happy with it thou.
1,NOT a portable drive,"Amazon mislabeled this drive. It is an external desktop hard drive, not one of SimpleTech's portable hard drives. It is much heavier than the portable drives."
2,SimpleTech External Hard Drive,"OK, but much larger than I expected (physical size, not capacity. also, the bundled software is seen as MALWARE by a number of security applications!"
2,SimpleTech 250G USB drive,"This probably works well if it's what you have in mind. It wasn't what I wanted, though. I wanted a USB drive that would automatically back up individual files from my hard drive. This does a system restore type backup so you can restore your operating system. I ended up buying a Maxtor USB drive that automatically copies the individual files I select."
1,looks nothing like the picture!,"The head piece looks so cheap, and the mane lays flat, no matter what you do. Its very cheap, and they won't give you a refund either. I really think they are misleading us by putting a picture of a nicer costume but actually selling you the super cheap one. Amazon should step in and say the picture must match the product recieved. Regardless of price, you should get whats pictured, or clearly state its not."
2,too thin and too small,"Material is too thin, would be good for a warmer climate. My baby wears size 12 months but this barely fits him. Have to return it."
3,"Cute, but very thin.","The costume was cute, but super thin material. You could see through the bottom part of the costume. We weren't expecting too much for this price."
2,really only one good song,the only good song on here is tuck me in youd be better off buying the single
2,LIVE Recordings only,"The CDs are OK, and there is a chance to hear the birth of Progressive Rock. But buy SM I, II and III first.This is still better than any post 1970 recordings of lukewarm jazz by Soft Machine with only 1 or 0 original members."
3,music of somewhat limited interest .,"2 cd set that contains 1 cd of very early free jazz experiments and a 2nd. cd of early live recordings including almost all of ""live at the paradiso 1969"". the live recordings are much better than the free jazz. both cds are of limited interest."
2,purple beamer,"for the cost, $30 this was lameit had cute color and was fuzzy as expectedbut it wasn't bigger than my handthe merchant did deliver the product on time and I have shipped it back for a refund"
2,Lawyer-proof Your Life,"Not much value to anyone who has dealt with various legal matters thru the years. Might be somewhat helpful to newbe's, but there is no red meat to grab onto. Way overpriced. I purchased thru used book seller search for $40 and felt I overpaid."
5,Put a damper on it,"This has a lot of uses beyond car applications. I used a sheet of it on the drywall behind in-wall speakers to cut the amount of sound radiating through the back wall and tighten the sound. I used a sheet of it inside a computer case, to eliminate a tinny rattle that came from the case vibration while it was on. You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter.It does have one drawback, and that's the fact that once you stick it on something, you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess. It is essentially tar with a foil outer cover, and trying to get it off just leaves a bunch of sticky tar behind. So, choose the place you want it carefully before sticking it down!"
1,LOT OF WORK NOT MUCH IN RETURN,The dynamat does stick to everything it touches but that's about it. I used it in my van that I use to travel with my family and it did nothing but ligthen my pocketbook. It was a lot of work with removing door panels and I even lined the floor with it also but to no avail. I WOULD HOLD ON TO YOUR MONEY AND USE IT ON SOMETHING ELSE
1,Waste of money,"I started with the speaker packs. I saw very little result. Then dynamat said, well you really need to do the whole door, so I did. $400 later, I still have as much road noise as before and I covered my entire door frame on all 4 doors.Don't buy in to the hype. I know it sounds good, but the people who got results are just idiots who believe everything the are told. ""Miller lite is good beer, isn't it Johnny? See the pretty women on TV, you'll get them too if you drink Miller Lite."" ""Duh... Yes... lite beer is good.."""
3,Kind of short,It was awfully short and only really developed the main character(s) in the last few minutes.The character types found within and the background have a good potential for a high quality anime if there was a good story to go with it.
3,Very stylish and intriguing Anime,"Twilight of Dark Master is beautifully drawn Anime with very stylish cinematography, resembling that of dramatic Hong Kong action films. Despite its violent and gory content, such stylish quality makes it interesting to watch, in a eccentric, twisted sort of way. However, I felt the movie was little short with very little story development, leaving not much understanding of the plot or the characters."
3,It had it's ups and downs,"This movie had a great story and very nice art. The voices were done well also. If you like your movies having good plots and stories and don't care too much for battles and fighting, I'd say you would like this movie a lot. But i like my movies with a little more fighting, blood, and all that other good stuff.I think this movie could have been a lot better though. There wasn't really a climax in the movie. It was just a constant flow. Even at the end of the movie, the fight scene was a little on the dull side.I don't know if I'd recomend to buy this movie. Unless you like the type of movie with a good story and not much action. I like all kinds of animes, but this one just didn't seem all that interesting to me."
4,Cool movie with a few flaws,"Twilight of the Dark Master was, in my opinion, a cool movie. The main character was powerful. In many movies, heroes and villains get into huge brutal battles, exhibiting phenomenal power but always managing to end with some dramatic finish and/or stalemate. Not so with this. Also, the animation was great and the ending very clever. On the critical side, the movie was too short, leaving some questions unanswered clearly. I would recommend renting before purchasing, as $20 is a bunch to pay for 50 minutes."
4,"an exceptionally good anime, that could have been better","(...) Many people (...) seem to think that things like quality of script, plot, dubbing, and character development actually matter in an anime. THEY DON'T!!!!!! We're not talking about a high budget drama about the meaning of life, we're talking about cartoons. What does make a good anime? ACTION, GORE, NUDITY, and of course how completely insane it is. That's why anime like ninja scroll, twighlight of the dark master and Akira are so badass. Twighlight is only about 50 min long but makes good use of the time with a little nudity, some gore, and a few very hardcore fight scenes. My only complaint is that they could have extended the final showdown a little. The movie has an ending that is both suprising and intense, and leaves you wondering what exactly happened. Basically this movie has everything a good anime should"
2,I am cheated!,"Simply put, I felt cheated out of my money.Shamelessly shallow in character development and no plot to talk of.Dubbed script is stunted.Animation is the only positive and then only barely.Overall very disapointing movie."
1,Not worth watching.,The ultimate battle between good and evil? What a laugh. This was a totally boring movie that I had very little intrest in. Don't waist your money on this one.
1,unreliable,this product did not work and I notified the company and am still waiting for information as to how to return product/ Plese advise
4,Basic calculator with cover,"For $3.98 you can't beat the price. It's small, with a cover and fits easily in your purse or pocket. I bought it to keep in my desk drawer after my previous ""freebie"" calculator died."
5,calculator with a cover,"If you want a basic calculator with a cover, this is what you want. Not as compact as Aurora HC 100X, but the keypad is a little bit more comfortable."
3,OK. Not worthy of the Elsimate name.,"A good cheap calculator. The protective cover defeats its purpose. To open the cover, you rip the case open, exposing the internal electonics. If it doesn't tear up, it works well. Cheaply made, so shop around, don't pay more than $3 for this."
2,Better Options Elsewhere,I'll never understand why companies make calculators without punctuation. It's much harder to read the numbers without commas. Sharp says that the unit has punctuation. It doesn't. The description is deceptive both here and on Sharp's website.
4,Basic Calculator,"I purchased this calculator for use on my financial accounting exams in college. They require this specific calculator for use on the exams so everyone is on a ""level playing field"" so to speak. That being said, it must be good, right? From what I can tell, it is a good calculator. Nothing fancy though. If you want a small, easy to read/use, basic calculator this one is a good choice."
3,too small,can not see #. give product away to goodwills. might be good for childcare centers or someone with very small hands.
2,Mini Calc,"This thing is too small, I wouldn't have bought it if I had seen it.Quality, you get what you pay for, this is cheap, spend a few more bucks.I just wanted a solar calculator to add/subtract for balance my checkbook. I'll get a bigger desk model."
4,Handy little calculator.,"Nice useful calculator. Not as nice as the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator, which I really like, it is great just the same. It has a hard case that protects the calculator from regular use or putting in one's pocket or briefcase. It goes off when you close the case. It is a good size to use on the go or on your desk. Looking for a handy durable calculator, I think this will fit the tbill. More so, the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator will be even better. See my other review."
3,"Runs very big, had to return","These run very big and very loose. The toes were coming out because the tip of the sandal is very narrow across. FIY, when you return with prepaid shipping label for Amazon.com, they will charge you in the form of ""adjustment on your return"". I didn't read the fine print and was charged $3.99 (or, rather, credited $3.99 less original purchase price.)"
3,Comfy but smelly,"These shoes were really great this past summer, however I think after a few wears without socks, his feet and the inside of the shoes began to smell. He has worn them this fall with socks without a problem."
2,Not that great,"Of all the shoes my son has ever owned I like these least, not because they are uncomfortable but because they are the only shoes that have ever stunk. He has had lots of sandals that he wore without socks, none have ever stunk. I can't get the stink out and we are going to have to throw them out after very little wear. If he had a foot oder problem I'd understand, but he doesn't have that problem. Skip these and find another brand. We ended up with crocs."
3,Does the job,"Does what it promises. You probably could get an equally effective cable splitter at a dollar store, but for me it wasn't worth the hour of my life to save a few bucks (especially with free shipping)."
2,Better and worse,"So much clearer than the comics, but the product makes you think it's the whole season. It's only half. Very disappointing!"
1,no go,Stopped loading after about 20 seconds. Repeated this each time I reloaded the page. Would not be willing to purchase any others.
2,"So NOT ""Buffy""","Ok, so if you're looking for a continuation of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, You WILL be disappointed. This is a TEN minute video- they say it starts where Season 7 ends, but there are 3 things that are new, they have to do with 1. location, obviously, 2. Dawn, 3. aftermaths of ""Sunnydale crater"". In these ten minutes there is 1 fight-minor (with monsters who's drool burns through wood, but when the monsters die the slayers stand in it and it does nothing to them), no answers and many questions. I feel as though this a cheap poorly made substitute for those of us that love BTVS.It's sad when I feel as though I've wasted 99 cents. yes they may be TRYING to do this in order to sell more episodes, but I'm disappointed and won't be purchasing any more of this crap.Sorry Joss, stick with live action."
3,it is Buffy afterall,"First you must realise this is a motion comic, not a cartoon, so you have to enjoy motion commics or this is simply not for you.Its been a long time since the tv series has ended and reading some previous reviews i think some people have forgotten what Buffy was actually like, this motion comic does have some really silly storylines and at times even a little annoying but the same could be said about all the original series on tv, the true strenght of Buffy was always the charactors that we all loved irraguardless of what silly plots were going on.I found this to be a welcome addition to my Buffy collection, some times silly some times gold, always entertaining and a little crazy.as an artist i found the annimation visuals to be quite stunning with a great use of color and layers."
1,Don't like the Comic Version,"I found that I don't like the comic version of Buffy. It's hard to replace SMG, James M., David B., and the rest of the cast as their respective characters. In many ways, the actors made the characters."
3,Buffy for Punters,"I have to say, the Astonishing X-Men motion-comic is a lot better. The action is smoother and the lips move, but then again look who's involved in that project ... the legendary Neal Adams.Still it's nice to see the storyline animated (if only it was as good as Buffy Seasons 2-3). And it's fun to watch with the family. It's nice to see well-loved characters come to pseudo-life. I'll be getting more of these.I wish the dialogue was written for the whole family, but it's mostly okay. It's really lame to champion adults-only comic books. The genre is best suited for the whole family."
1,Sorry Excuse,"Who ever ""created"" ( I use term very loosely) was deluded. Who still uses still animation anymore? Total waste of money and they changed the story line to ray gun futuristic claptrap. Give me a break!"
3,"Technically, The Title is Bogus","Overall, what you get here is what it sounds like: A motion comic version of the Season 8 comic series with adequate (though not exceptional) voice acting. However, the title of this set is misleading. This is NOT the entire ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 8"" series as motion comics. Instead, this is the first 19 issues (out of 40 total) in that form, up through the ""Time of Your Life"" storyline. In other words, you get about 1/2 of the series here (19/40 issues or 4/8 collected editions), rather than the entire ""season."" The packaging does not make this obvious at all, unless you happen to know that the series runs 40 issues so that you recognize the big red flag that emerges when it says ""All 19 Issues"" on the packaging. It's an okay set, but it is not what it purports itself to be in the way that matters most: being the full season."
2,Not the full season.,I was unaware at the time of purchase that this isn't the entirety of season 8. No where in the product description does it say this.
2,Stick With The Comic Itself,"I only watched the first episode, but the voices were terrible, so I couldn't bring myself to watch another one. Not only do they not sound anything like the original actors, but they get the cadence of the Buffy-speak all wrong. And maybe someone can verify or debunk this story, but when the trailer came out, an unnamed source claimed that none of the original writers or artists were being paid royalties for the motion comic. If it's true, that alone is enough reason not to buy the motion comic."
2,"I'm disappointed, but it's not your fault","I'm really disappointed about this 2 disc blue-ray dvd combo, not for the quality or the packaging (everything was perfect), but because this is not the complete season 8 of Buffy, as you could think, but only half of it. On the cover there was no warning about it (I don't know, they could put something like Part 1, or so)! So, now I have just the first part of the season and no clue about if or when the rest will ever be published! Am I right or not?"
2,Misleading Info,"Cannot believe Amazon didn't disclose this tiny little fact that there are only 19 issues in this release! Seen the box specs and guess what, right there in the back it says ""19 issues"".Way to mislead you customers."
3,Bad Accents but the snarky is intact,"I think it is unfair to hope for the greatness of a one hour television spot in a comic book.I found the comics hard to get into (still dont know why) but this motion comic is great. The only negative I can see is horrible, horrible english accents. Oh and once in a while the voice actor/actress will say a joke a little differently than the character they are portraying. Anyone who has watched a lot of Buffy will be able to jump right in, with this moving format making the transition to comic a little easier.Yeah its not what we want (we want the show back) but its what we have. The writing is still solid and the I'm pretty hooked. Give it at least two episodes before you make a decision (they are very short and you cant get a good sense of them in just one clip).Also, some of the things that are different are unexplained because they will be explained later. Read the wikipedia article if you want to know ahead of time why Dawn is different."
3,Just Not The Same,Oh how I wish this show had not been cancelled!!! The comic just wasn't enough to keep me watching. I think I'll pull out my Buffy DVD's and watch.
2,Waste of time,Only gave it two stars bc it's Buffy but its really a waste of time and not thrilling at all.
3,Just wasn't up to,"Season 6 was messy and disjointed. The stories were inconsistent which is ultra rare for the rest of this series, even season 7. The characters would go in and out of the series with several episodes going by without characters you'd expect to be there. A sloppy season. You have to watch it to get to 7 which helps make up for it."
4,Interesting to see how the show might have played on,I'd like to see these motion comics- but i don't want to own them- and $2 per issue/episode is too much money. would like to see amazon offer a much lower fee for rental viewing of these.where this fails miserably is the voice actors. they are using the faces of the actors from the tv series- but they didn't make any effort to get voices even close to the real actors. and i thought the buffy voice was irritating and badly acted/emoted_ if you're going to get 1 voice right it should be the lead. so i liked seeing it but didn't like hearing it.
1,Really Useless Book,"This is a book filled with no insight and inane ramblings. The drawings are second grade doodles that you wouldn't put on your refigerator from your own kids and the so called facts are vapid and unsubstantial. This is a good, cheap and impersonal gift for the office person having a baby that you couldn't care less but have to buy a gift for. However, if it is for yourself or someone of substance, shop on, for you will be very disappointed in this boring exercise of self absorption."
3,a seminal piece of writing,"Dutch theologian, warmly Trinitarian and missional in his thinking, highly conversant with ecumenical movement of 1940s and 50s, pushes us to consider the whole body of Christ, including the laity, not just the clergy, as a community of faith on mission in the world. Only the clergy have not allowed, first; now, not enabled the laity to fulfill their place in the world -- which is after all the most substantial place!!little hard to meander through all the references to Catholic theology and practice and World Council of Churches processes from an earlier era."
3,you can handle them all,"Great book, great resource for my profession. I was saddened that I received the older edition . I didn't see or know the boon I ordered was not the latest edition. I guess I learned ."
1,You Can Handle Them All? NOT!!!,"As a beginning teacher, I was excited to see that all student behavior could be reduced to 117 simple cards. I was ready for the do-nothing, the lollygagger, and the mothballer. Unfortunately, the scrapper mixed up the deck, and now I can't tell the naughty Nancies from the Polite Petes. HELP!!!"
5,Just a Little Shy.,"PLATINUM TOO is the follow-up album to the very popular PLATINUM. Both feature favorite songs from Sesame Street. PLATINUM TOO pretty much feels in the gaps left by the first album. Well that's not quite true because these albums only cover Sesame Street favorites through the early 1990s. Still, it's a great album and I've been giving it a lot of airplay on my webradio show. Some of my favorite tunes are:""Counting is Wonderful""""Caribbean Amphibian""""The Grouch Song""""Believe in Yourself""""The Ballad of Casey MacPhee""""Take a Breath""""Mah Na Mah Na""""One of These Things""""One Small Voice""This is a wonderful companion piece to PLATINUM and is a great album to own and play for kids."
5,My daughter loves it!,"My 2 year old can dance and jump up and down for the full length of this CD. She absolutely loves it; she asks for us to play it all day every day and she never gets enough. I also think it's a great CD. I originally bought the album solely for ""Mah Na Mah Na"" and although it wasn't the Muppet Show version that I wanted, I quickly got used to this one and I also love the album almost as much as my daughter does - it's a great energy. It is a permanent addition to our CD changer now - only the other 4 slots change."
5,On the other side of sesame Street:,"A brilliant CD for children, and adults alike. I got this CD, because one of the kids I babysit LOVES singing along with the sesame street videos, so I figured he would enjjoy dancing and singing along to the CD aswell. I was right! He loves singing along to all the classic sesame songs, and I love singing along too! Makes me remember my days as a little girl when I sang the same songs! Very cute. Kids of all ages will get a kick out of this CD. =)"
4,I love Mah Na Mah Na!!,"Me and my Peanut both enjoyed ""Mah Na Mah Na"". It is good for the entire family. Well done, Bert. This is our very first review."
3,not enough Elmo,"My 21 month old adores Elmo, and will not settle for the rest of the Sesame Street gang. I have to keep forwarding to a song that has him in it. The Best of Elmo is better for the Elmo fans.Otherwise, there are a lot of fun songs on here."
5,Works as advertised,I lost my previous component cable for the Wii and this was an easy replacement. It seems to have good build quality and the price was unbeatable. Put me down as a satisfied customer.
3,Is it worth the Price,"Gave it a 3 star rating because cables are built well for the price. I have this hooked up to a 40"" Samsung LCD TV. Does it actually make the graphics better on my LCD TV? The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because I really can't tell the difference in clarity between the cables you get from Nintendo that come with the wii and these cables I ordered. I guess what I'm saying is these cables could enhance the graphics but not enough to make a difference to the naked eye."
2,Not an up scaling device,If your looking for an up scaling device this is not it. If your looking for a way to hook your wii into your TV this is great! Colors and video were as they should be and I have no complaints.Update was working great now only showing black and white images. Have gotten a return label and trying the HDMI converter route now.
2,Poor quality,"The cables do not fit snugly, resulting in a poor connection, and the picture and sound quality is very poor. Don't waste your money; buy better cables"
3,Cheap way to get the most of our your Wii,"The Wii may not be a HD device, but at least with this cable you can get the best resolution possible out of it. Works great, drastically lower price than the Nintendo OEM component cable - no complaints and highly recommended."
4,Works fine,"Only issue with the cable is the spacing for the audio and video (someone else mentioned this as well)--there's no way to separate them further, so if your audio and video inputs are not right next to each other, you'll either need an extension or a different cable."
5,HD Wii!,Great product and makes a real difference in picture quality when using the Wii on my big HD TV.
5,If you like groovy downtempo...,"...then you'll dig this one. Probably better than the original, Freaks & Icons, although that album certainly has its merits as well. A must for folks who like K&D, Tosca, Thievery Corp. etc. Give it a listen and you'll probably want it."
5,Good stuff but BEWARE,"These tracks are really good - but they're the same ones you have if you have the D&K Live in Vienna version with the bonus disc. I downloaded these and they were familiar, so I looked and it only took a second to realize I paid for things I already had."
5,LONGING FOR A PLACE,"Black Cobra is a series that makes money in the Phillipines with no problem even to this day. But this series is longing for a place in the world as a story reaped from the American Action type drama.I've given it all stars only because of Fred Williamson's trials as an African in a white world that doesn't cater to his world. And I also admire Fred Williamson's courage to have established his own production company Po' Boy Productions.The Black Cobra series wasn't a great series, but the first Black Cobra movie alone was good. And once again a story from a white liberal filmmaker's point of view which was derived from a novel written by a white liberal."
5,Very cute and protects little hands,"These are nice little garden gloves. They are a little big for my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter but she'll grow into them as they look like they will last a long time. She loves to help me in the yard and I wanted something to protect her hands. These are cute, so she likes to wear them and they keep her hands from getting scratched."
5,Cute!,"These gloves are cute and fit my 7yr old daughter well. Now she feels ""fancy"" when helping in the garden."
2,Don't Bother. Seriously.,"This seems like a good deal, but really- don't get suckered. The CD's are packed into a set to save money, but the package quality is horrible. It looks like the inserts were done on a dot matrix home printer. The Cd's are black w/ silver etches... even the backs are edited. The Cd's themselves are pretty bad too. Her early stuff is only good to compare as to how much she's improved. Rhythm of Love is okay but- start off your Kylie collection with Rhythm as a stand alone- get the beautiful pictures in a quality format and ignore two albums of early junk."
4,sweet,if you like dancin you'll like this cd. with songs like MAKE THAT MONEY you won't want to stop. it has great fast pumpin beats with induindos of rap and great female vocals. i LOVE this group!!!
4,An American in London,"There is a strange ambiance in this movie, as if we were dealing with spies in an Cold War era..You would expect Keitel's character to walk in the next Cafe Rouge to meet a Russian couple for dinner and ...well, conversation...Dave Arnold's music is just great, adding the necessary eerie side to the foggy London streets on which our DEA man chases his prey. Great work altogether, and a must see for Americans in Europe..."
4,This Is A Great Film Starring A Great Actor,I caught this movie on TV one Saturday afternoon while flipping through the Channels. Seeing Harvey Keitel got my attention but the movie itself kept it. It's a really good movie. I was suprised that I hadn't heard of it before. Check it out. Its a great deal especially at the price Amazon offers it for.
3,In & Out region code 2,"I received the dvd fast, great shipping. We have a problem with the dvd itself. It does not work, can you please submit me a full refund. I cannot play this dvd. I tried everything.... Unfortunately the product is not good to me like this. I hope we can work this out. Thank-you so much cncbookboutique"
4,Great cast,"An amusing and tender-hearted take on self-discovery and acceptance of differences. Every cast member is terrific: Kline at his best, Cusack incredibly funny, Reynolds seniorly sparkling, and Newhart -- well, Newhart."
5,Indiana Can Be Fun.,A nice look at man accused of being Gay! It shows how many people of the midwest can be. I admit there is a nicety about the midwest. All acting is in true to storyline character. This is a great rip-roarious good time. This is a good snuggle up with your significant other couch flick!
4,very cute flic,"I have to say that this was truly a funny movie which made me laugh out loud. It was about an english teacher who is about to be married. After watching a former student on televsion give an acceptance speech he announces to the world that his former teacher is gay. It was truly funny to see Kevin Kline's character try to find out if he is gay or straight. His fiancee is played by Joan Cusack who is also hysterical in her role. I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like to sit back, relax and watch a cute, funny movie. There isn't anything to think about but watch and go for the ride. Enjoy!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:In and Out is humming along merrily before a gut-wrenchingly awful scene in the school's auditorium grinds the pleasantly-amusing comedy to a screeching halt; if I think a little I can remember the scenes in the film that made me laugh, but the first thing that comes to mind is that shamelessly terrible and agonizingly long sequence near the end."
4,Cultural Awareness Through Stereotypes,"Almost everyone in ""In & Out"" is an extreme stereotype. Kline's scholarly and fastidious Mr. Brackett, Matt Dillon as the extremely air headed and self-obsessed actor, and Shalom Harlow as (no stretch here) the super model. All together, the characters in ""In & Out"" are a bit two-dimensional, which makes the story of the film work extremely well.This is not a brainy movie, rather it is one you can share with your friends. It's a good laugh (the script being very well written) and it doesn't try to be something that it's not.Does the film have a message? Of course it does, and it's exactly the one you'd assume it is. The message isn't the movie, however. Fans of good humor will love this movie, regardless of the point. Five minutes of Joan Cusack alone is worth the price of the DVD.Seriously.""In & Out"" is warm, inoffensive and loveable. You'll recognize someone you know in almost every single character. Definitely a feel good movie."
5,A campy hoot,"Those who enjoy ""high camp"" may be a tad disappointed by this unusually tender film. Kevin Kline manages to keep a ""straight"" face throughout his coming out ordeal as Howard Brackett, outed by a former student-come-movie star. Don't miss Joan Cusack as the hapless bride and Debbie Reynolds as the ""marriage addicted"" mother. Get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy! And above all, don't take it too seriously..."
5,"Love, love, love it!","Kevin Kline is FANTASTIC in this movie, as is Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Damon, and everyone else in the movie. It is hilarious, especially when he listens to a training tape, and when Cusack is in the bar with Selleck... best performances ever. I've watched it over and over again and is one of my very favorites ever since it first came out. It also has a great message about being true to yourself and not and accepting others for who they are as a person, not how they act or look. Not to miss."
4,In and Out is Out and Out funny,"If any comedies with Kevin Kline have gone wrong, this Frank Oz (!) vehicle isn't one of them. With a plot that could have gone to absurdity, this is a charmer that actually is a heart-warmer as well. Kevin veers between calm and nervous breakdown as the news spreads, Joan Cusack delivers a character in Emily that's fun to watch (""IS EVERYBODY GAY!!!???"") and even Bob Newhart delivers some deadpan laughs. Oh, did I mention the only really steamy kiss in the film belongs to Kline and Tom Selleck? (whoa)And Kevin's dance number to ""I Will Survive"" is priceless. This is a good way to spend 90 minutes."
2,Average.,"In & Out starring Kevin Kline is a pretty tame and predictable film. Kline is a talented actor so his performance is clever and memorable but the plot and jokes fall flat, everyone raved about this film when it was released in 1997, but I found this ""coming out"" story completely shallow and lifeless. Matt Dillion is also good in this, wish his character was in the film more. So-so comedy that left me bored, decide for yourself."
3,Not great; full of stereotypes...,"The premise of the movie about a high school teacher 'outed' on prime time television has a lot of potential as a comedy, but could have been a lot better. While some of the humor hits the target, the film is full of stereotypes - perhaps intentionally so - which in some scenes insult the intelligence of its audience. Anyone who would watch this movie is probably open-minded enough to deal with the subject of homosexuality, so the attempt to show that 'being gay is okay' probably was aimed in the wrong direction. I disagree that the film is 'propaganda'; it tries to show both sides of the issue, but does come off as a bit preachy, though well-intentioned. I think the Barbara Striesand jokes got a little old - none of my gay friends listen to her! And to imply that a gay man will inevitably break into dance to ""I Will Survive"" - oh, please! A bit too silly."
4,So much fun.,"This is a great video that I have watched many times. The script is original, and the actors act well. The irony is apparent, and it keeps you laughing through most of the film."
1,A wonderful movie experience,"My big butch male lover and I sat and watched this very sexy movie together and boy did we get hot! That Magnum sure is a great actor - and what a kisser, though it did make me feel a bit sick to see him kissing another guy! What would Higgins think!?!I would thoroughly recommend this movie for anyone who wanted to inflict 90 minutes of eel-headed stupidity upon themselves.Love and kisses, XXXXXXX"
1,An Actual Review,"I bought this movie because so many people reviewed it and said it was funny. And I like Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck. Well, save your money, I laughed once. This movie was totally predicatable and disappointingly unfunny.Could it be that all the people raving about this movie are raving about it because they are either gay themselves or gay-friendly, and would give ANY movie 5 stars for showing the gay lifestyle in a positive light?If you do not want to watch a politically correct propaganda piece from ACT-UP, then skip this movie."
3,Funny in Spots; Ultimately Depressing,"Unlike other reviewers, I thought this film did play on gay stereotypes, although not in a particularly mean-spirited way.Of more concern was the fact that the turning point of the film -- the groom announcing that he was gay at the altar, devastating the bride -- remained unresolved. Yes, there is a happy ending, but the bride is not part of it.Also, if I were from Indiana, where the story supposedly takes place, I would be offended by me and my fellow citizens being depicted as bigoted yokels.If you want a comedy that deals with gays sympathetically yet doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth, try ""Happy, Texas,"" ""The Birdcage,"" or ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."""
4,Ok,"If you are a fan of Kevin Kline comedy, you should like this movie which is the main reason I gave it four stars, I consider it an at times movie: at times it's funny, at times it drags, at times it thought provoking, but ,Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Tom Selleck, Debbie Reynolds, Bob Newhart, and Wilford Brimley did enough to make this movie enjoyable."
3,Good job Kevin Kline,"The DVD was in good condition and player just fine. Good movie; kind of a surprise, sleeper in content. good experience"
5,A CLASSIC,"Kevin Kline stars as the soon-to-be married small town teacher who is outed by one of his pupils during a television appearance. these are merley the seeds to an energetic comedy where Kevin Kline manicially runs around in the film trying to prove that he's not gay. There is a superb cast here which includes a fine supporting role from Tom Selleck who plays an openly gay reporter, as well as Joan cusack, matt Dillon and Whoopi Goldberg. They all sparkle against Paul Rudnick's razor sharp scripts that bubbles with fast, furious wit. Kevin Kline puts in a sensitive, carefully conceived performance rather than settling for a stereotypical role. Consistently funny throughout - a classic. Highly recommended."
4,Lighten up!,"This was a light and very fun film! Very enjoyable! I'm surprised at some of the criticisms. But, then again, there are those with problems with their own ego-dystonic sexual orientation. (So, I think that explains some of the uncomfortableness.) Still, I insist this is not a GAY film. It's a comedy and a damn good one. In fact, the closest film I'd compare this to is The Philadelphia Story. (So, come on you closet queens. Just admit that you liked it and get over it.)"
4,WHERE'S THE DVD?,"There is so much schlock out on DVD, and yet this intelligent, fascinating, well-acted movie has yet to be released on DVD - WHAT GIVES???????"
4,Enduring Picasso,"I find Anthony Hopkins to be a master at becoming whatever he intends to create. He was just as believable as President Nixon in ""Nixon"", as he was a madman in ""Silence Of The Lambs"". Here again, he does not dissapoint me. The movie is dark, and I would tend not to agree with the accuracy of the historical aspects of the film, but I did find Hopkins to be a compelling Picasso. And, yes once again, I found myself watching Pablo Picasso. I enjoy biographies of painters and creative souls, and I would be hard pressed to find a biography that is uplifting and has a happy ending. I found the same in ""Surviving Picasso"". It is a little long in the tooth, but I found the cinematography to be beautiful and again, Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance is beautiful. I would reccomend this for any Hopkins lover."
4,"If you are a Picasso fan, this video is a must-see.","This video gives insight into the life and persona of Picasso. While it touches on his climb to fame, recognition and success in the art world, it focuses primarily on his personal relationships. I love his work, but I sure wouldn't have wanted to live with him! The video had therapuetic effects for me; I would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly calls into question your own view of relationships, how they are and how they should and shouldn't be. A winner all the way around."
4,Hopkins is Picasso!,"I have loved Anthony Hopkins for years, his hitler was one of the greatest performances ever by an actor, and he brings Picasso to life with an understated yet dramatic performance. The art is fantastic, even though I don't really like his style, and the love affair is touching. Watching this movie is a great way to gain appreciation for the man's life, or annoyance if you look at Picasso's ego and how it effected women. It ended far to early in Picasso's career but thus is the story being told. Great movie of art and an artist."
2,Just readable,"This book finally reads more like a sci-fi novel than a reading of a manual of the DMC. Lon Nolan has the potential of becoming a stellar action hero, if Mr. Shelly has the ability to make him so. The action scenes need more vivid and exiting or spellbindig segments, while the character developement is almost captivating it falls just short. Compared with the first three books in the series this is the better of the three, but still not up to writers such as E.Moon, and D.Weber.I will give Mr. Shelly one more try and then decide on further purchases."
1,Major continues a mediocre trend,"Pity there is no option for half sstars, because Major is a marginal improvement over Captain. Another review of Major compares Shelley unfavorably to Moon and Weber; to me there is no comparison. Shelley's characters appear unmotivated, his plotting contrived and his writing is amazingly stilted. The technology seems awkward and bizarrely old-fashioned, compared even to the military today. The career success of Nolan, the protaganist,is inexplicable, as he never seems to do anything very impressively and always seems to react to opponents rather than drive his own opportunities. Let's face it; the idea of a mercenary planet like Dirigent is pretty absurd. But Shelley does nothing to make you suspend disbelief. And nothing to generate a lot of interest, either."
2,Utter Rubbish,"Ok. Lets be serious, now. I am a 15 year old male, but don't immediatley establish a steryotype. Sure, my spelling may not be stellar, but I'd like to think myself an accomplished reader, and I've particularly enjoyed the field of Military Sci-Fi. Ian Douglas has acheived my respect and admiration for his accurate potrayal of Warfare in space (hey, it sounded good!) Rick Shelly is a clown in the prestigious offices of literature. Hell, I'm suprised they let him in the lobby. He knows combat, and can write combat, but little more. The charactars (expecially the main one) are cardboard, static, and phony. Their moves are predictable, their thinking one-track. Surely you have better things to do than read trash books like these."
2,Chapped LIPS,"I'm a big fan of Surrender Cinema, however their latest entry has me worried that this once ""edgy"" film company has lost it. To begin with, the plot is weak -- but really, who cares. So long as the girls are white hot and the sex is good. Okay, in LIP Service we're batting 1 for 2. As can be expected, the girls were hot. What left me feeling cheated was the sex scenes. For one, there weren't many. For two, the girl/girl scenes were terrible. I thought I was watching a shampoo commercial, what with all the hair stroking. There was no kissing, no excitement, and no heat. After viewing SC classics as Femalien, Virtual Encounters and Veronica 2030, I'm surprised the powers-that-be at Surrender Cinema even let this dreck out the door. Hey, guys, go watch your earlier films ... go back to the basics. Your viewers demand it."
1,WALKING BORE,"IF YOUR EXPECTING A GREAT ZOMBIE STORY LIKE GEORGE ROMERO MAKES,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY.I BOUGHT THE 1-4 ISSUES AND FOUND IT QUIT BORING.THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A COP WHO AWAKENS FROM COMA(NO ORIGINAL IDEA BECAUSE THIS IS HOW THE MOVIE 28 DAYS LATER STARTS) ONLY TO FIND THE WORLD OVERRUN BY ZOMBIES AND HIS WIFE PREGNANT BY HIS BEST FRIEND.THE ZOMBIE BATTLES ARE LAME AND ALL THE CHARACTERS SEEM TO CARE MORE ABOUT IS JUMPING IN AND OUT OF BED WITH EACH OTHER.THEY DECIDE TO LIVE IN A PRISON TO REBUILD THEIR LIFE.HOW STUPID.IM SURPRISED THE WRITER DIDNT PUT THEM IN A MALL.NO ORIGINALITY NO FUN.SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A ZOMBIE DVD RENTAL."
4,Joyous!,"My family has made this film a Christmas tradition for the last few years. This ranks up there with A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, and A Clockwork Orange as far as holiday films go. ""Requiem"" is one the whole clan can enjoy, from toddlers to grandparents. This movie will really leave you feeling happy and warm. Ultimately, it's a tale of the triumph of the human spirit."
2,a sick twisted movie,"when I saw this, I really got really bored. um, yeah ok shes taking a lot of pills and shes becoming addictive. stuff like that, and basically its a stinker of a movie and I did not like it one bit but it had some powerful moments and some disturbing images that can keep locked in your head after its done, but primarily I just got sick of it in the middle. Though Leto and especially Connelley give great performances"
4,rated version-What'd I miss?,"I rented ""Requim for a Dream-rated version"" and am just wondering what I had missed. I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it (and saw it again several times after that), but want to know exactly what I missed out on.......what was exactly deleted? If I fell in love with this movie watching the rated version, I plan to own it as well.......but the full movie.So anyone please e-mail me and let me in on exactly if I missed anything prominent. If not so I could go ahead and buy the version I first rented instead of waiting around for the unedited version. Thanks in advance."
5,True to the Book and More,"Everyone comments on the excellent acting / storyline / filming of this film. I agree with everyone on this score and for this reason alone I would recommend everyone seeing the film. What amazed me is how true the picture was to the orginal story. It is very difficult to make a film from a great story and keep true to the orginal book. This film, however, does this and more. It doesn't make it darker than the book, nor does it try to whitewash the harrowing parts of the book. Great job."
1,a sick depressing movie,"This would have to be the sickest most depressing movie I have ever seen. A movie supposedly to show the dark side of drugs, instead it shows the dark side of life: a life without hope, or purpose full of dissapointment and illusion. There is never any reason to make a movie of this nature nor is there to watch it unless you want to witness a merciless destruction of hope and the human sprit. This movie will leave you depressed and wondering what would ever inspire a sicotic producer to produce such a film."
2,will Ellen Burstyn ever go away?,This is a very disturbing movie & not one that I'd care to see willingly ever again. When it was over I just had an empty feeling & felt as though I may have just possibly wasted a couple hours of my life. Not sure why so many people love this movie. I watched it because a friend of mine went on & on about how fantastic & shocking it was. I didn't find it shocking...just blah. I give it 2 stars because the acting was very well done & the storyline wasn't weak just not my kind of thing. Ellen Burstyn kind of got on my nerves too about 1/4 into the movie.
1,Requiem For A Bummer!!!!!,"I can't see what the big stink is about this flick.It stink, stank, stunk!I have never been depressed in all my 44 years. In fact, I didn't even know what people were experiencing who took anti-depressants, but after I saw this movie, I not only understood depression, but I understood suicide as well. I simply don't see what the point is. We ALL know that drugs are bad for you, why would anyone want to watch 2 hours of people going down the drain, when all you've got to do is turn on the evening news for 2 minutes?After Pi, a very strange but captivating movie in its own right, I had big expectations for this one, but no, no, no, no, no!This is a huge pile of garbage, don't waste your time, your money, or your sanity!"
3,The surreal in movies,"Movies that explore the surreal should conjure up the condition integrally. This is the case with the work of exponents such as director Luis Buñuel, with the point being that filmmakers in this genre are expected to experiment and to attempt to provoke us; which is why one celebrates works from Cocteau, Polanski, Hitchcock, Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Joel Schumacher, the Coens, etc., despite the fact that such experiences can be uneven, given the fragility of the medium. And yet. Despite the worthy performances and contributions, 'Requiem for a Dream' suffers from dialog that is merely serviceable and (as Salvador Dali knew) paramount to surrealism is humor, which director Aronfsky seems to lack considerably."
3,"Get a life!I could say more, but I think I'm going to dance!","This harsh film demonstrated one thing to me: people need to have a purpose. The over-riding theme was that none of these characters had anything to drive them; they had nothing to think about other than what was missing in their lives or how to get attention. If the older lady had a plot of land to work or some children to teach, or got out and exercised instead of sitting in front of a tv all day long, she would have felt a lot better about being ""old."" How sad that the only thing worth living for was the chance to get on tv. How sad for the other characters to live only to seek out more drugs. I love you Harry. If I heard that one more time, I think I would have to lose it. Instead, I'm going running! Thank God, there are SO many wonderful things ANY body can do!"
2,"boring, nothing special","I wanted to like this film. the trailer made it look good, and I thought ""Pi"" was at least worth a look. but this movie about bored me to tears.ok, ok I get it. drugs are bad. with some ""cool"" & ""dark"" music-video type imagery & a pretty girl. and drugs are bad. gee, uh, thanks."
2,Gripping?,"This movie was absolutely ridiculous. I thought it was a comedy, what with the fridge monster and all. The film really didn't bring much to the table as far as social commentary is concerned. That is to say that I've personally seen much worse...I guess living in Wisconsin, you get more livestock than you do real life experience, huh deadsummer?"
5,Ellen Burstyn should have won!,"A deeply moving and haunting movie about 4 people caught up in the world of drugs. I CANNOT BELIEVE they gave Julia Roberts the oscar over Ellen Burstyn, but thats the academy for you. This movie will stay in your mind for days. Ellen Burstyn and JEnnifer Connelly did an excellant job and the last half an hour will blow your mind. see this excellant movie. i cannot recommend this movie enough."
1,warning!!!!,"warning amazon costumer!! do not buy this dvd. it is an edited, r-rated version of the original film, which is one of the gratest movies of 2000. the original cut features frequent drug use and a really creepy sex scene that freaked the mpaa out! if you are easily offended, you shouldn't be buying this movie anyway. if you liked the movie, or you didn't watch it but are in search of something totally new and original, buy the unrated version. this one is not good."
1,Ripped off by a &^*##@# edited version,"This IS one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. I am a filmmaker and Darren is, IMHO one of the monster directors of our time. That said, this version being palmed off to unsuspecting film fans is a travesty. To be clear, LOVED THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATER. I hate, hate, hate this abomination. Look for the NC-17 version if you want to see what the filmmaker wanted you to experience in this movie. This is an adult movie with very adult themes, why, why, why, gut it in the edit suite?? So you could eek out a few more sales to the kiddies??"
5,The best movie I have ever seen,"Plain and simple--this movie is awesome. The characters all struggle with the pain of addiction and it all leads to destruction in their lives. The camera shots and special effects are great. The best part about this movie is the deep plot. Many people that see it for the first time don't fully absorb the profound message and plot behind the movie. Requiem goes much deeper than people abusing drugs, it shows how dependent people can become on objects that give them gratification and it shows how far people will go to accomplish their goals. It really takes you info the lives of the characters and puts you in their shoes. I would highly suggest that everyone see this movie at least once... it is truly one of a kind and powerful."
5,Close minded film buffs don't even bother,"Darren Aronofsky's tale of drug abuse awakens a genre that has been beaten to death with fresh terifyingly new imagery that will make you want to curl into a fetal position on the floor after you watch it, it's that powerful. Every conceivable detail to the camera angle, the dialogue is worked on to pure perfection, but what really puts this movie over to top is the score composed by Clint Mansell. The haunting tension building summer overture sets in the first few minutes the dramatic tone of the movie. This is not a movie for the faint of heart, or the conservative type, or the conventional mainstream movie goer, but if you can put this in your DVD and sit with an open mind, you will enjoy this film."
5,.....,"I watched this movie not knowing what to expect, although since i had seen Pi before, i was expecting something heavy.Something about it made me feel emotions, but I didn't cry because something about it didn't seem right. It's more like something where I just have to sit and think for a while, but even that may not help.The idea of following a druggie with their addiction may be old, but the way it is done is wonderful. The intertwining of the stories only adds to the experience. Also it follows not only those who brought the addiction upon themselves, but it also incorporates those who became addicted innocently.This is definatly a movie you can't watch when down because you can't just walk away without being affected, but i suppose that is a sign of a good movie, isn't it?"
4,Very good,"It was directed by the same guy who did ""Pi"".The movie is very dark...very intense & hardcore."
4,Eerie,This is one of the most haunting films you'll ever see. Requiem is a very artsy creepy movie which follows 4 lives to utter bleak destruction. It's a very suffocating film and I wouldn't suggest it for anyone who couldn't handle Frances...or anyone who wouldn't want to see some graphically disturbing depictions of sexuality turned morbid. If you're looking for something original and different...this is right for you.
5,Requiem for my Dream!,"My God! Ellen Burstyn should really have won the Oscar! The Picture, the Score, the Actors and Actresses the whole thing is great! I'm not from america so I can't even explain this Movie! it is so great so breathtaking and fasinating! Oh My God I have never seen a such important and serious film in my whole life!The whole plot is great! Its really, realy spectacular indead! It teaches you what drugs are able to do to you! I swear to god that I'll never tuch any kind of drugs! It's a Movie you just can't forget! You will always think about it and the Score will always stay in your mind! I love this Picture I love this DVD and I love the Story and the Score! Oh my God I love it!!!!!!!"
2,"""Drugs are bad, mmkay. You shouldn't do drugs, mmkay""","There is a lot of aesthetically pleasing and artistic camera and story work in this movie, but ultimately it comes off as an R-rated after-school special.It's not a matter of not liking sad stories. There are plenty of tragic tales that peak everyone's interest (Shakespeare anybody?) but this one has such a blunt-force trauma aspect that it's difficult to take it seriously. It says, ""here are some people who do drugs and every conceivable absolutely horrid thing that can happen to them amplified.""Perhaps the DVD cover should read, ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter."""
1,Two thumbs down,"My life is the poorer for having watched this movie. Yes, there are good points- it was wonderfully acted and the screenplay and direction were beautiful. But overall there is no reason for the film's existence. Watching the film was like trying to wake up from a nightmare- I kept wanting it to be over. I felt no sympathy for the characters. In the end they received their due. It is a movie about the evils of drug addiction. Well, that has been done before- repeatedly. And much better. It added nothing new to the entire addiction debate. There was no unique viewpoint. I felt physically dirty after watching."
5,Beauty,"It is absurd yet comforting to, as the amazon reviewer has, relegate this film to the destruction of hope when it is sought through back-alley dreams. The character played by Ellen Burstyn is as absurd as that of her drug addled son and as absurd as reality however you choose to experience it. One should be left hopeless after this film and to transpose this ennui onto mere drug addiction is to deny the truth and beauty of this film and to create one's own illusory sense of life. We are all lost in the same mist, heroin, television, whatever and this film is universal, not a condemnation of particular lives, but of all life. This is, however, why this film will never gross 100 million in the box office, it is not a film the populous could or should comprehend. It is a film for the existentialist."
1,wrong version,i was shipped an edited version of the movie not the directors cut version. fail on discriptionnot happy with purchase.
1,got charged but would not play,"I am sure this is a good movie, but I paid to rent it and it used to play on my Kindle. I can't even find anywhere tor request a refund for VOD. I have wasted the last 20 mins trying to find a way to do so, gave up so I am writing this bad review."
5,THIS is It....skip Trainspotting.,"As a former addict/drug abuser this is it. The most realistic depiction of addiction I've ever seen on film. Never want to see it again. It was a flashback to the horror, the black creeping death, the living breathing nightmare I never EVER EVER EVER want to experience again. It IS Hell. A shocking and nauseating reminder, and I truly cannot thank the director of this film enough for that. He's done us all a real service by making this movie, trust me. If you've got a friend toying with the idea of playing with needles or whatever other strange addictive object, tie them up, put tape on their lids to keep their eyes open, andMAKE THEM WATCH THIS FILM."
5,Talk about an overdose!,"Want to really scare kids off drugs? Then show them this movie, they'll never even take asprin again.This movie is running on all cylinders! From the moment you turn it on you can't take your attention away from it as it slowly takes you down a rabbit hole of addiction and pain. Superbly directed by Darren Aronofsky it keeps you in your seat the whole way down. The acting is great and the art direction makes you feel like you yourself are having a bad trip. A must own movie for any film buff, but be prepared with a comedy afterwards to brighten your day otherwise you'll be wishing you never ordered it. Amazing movie, definatly worth any price!"
4,The most harrowing portrait of addiction ever...except for the book,"As other reviewers have noted, this film is unique in its harrowingly honest portrayal of addiction, from the inside out. Though it can't entirely capture the intensity and inwardness of Selby's book, it comes as close as anyone can reasonably expect. A grim, horrifying depiction of a subject that should never be glorified or prettified; an encapsulation of a nightmare."
5,Drugs and,"A fantastically made movie about drugs and the world around them, however made in an artistic and taboo breaking way. A very honest look at the world of drugs and the people that get swallowed up in it."
4,"Forget the ""drug talk,"" pop this movie for your kids instead","This movie will AFFECT YOU. It's designed to disturb, and it will accomplish its mission, regardless of how you define ""disturbance.""The last 20 minutes of this film almost gave me a panic attack. As of now I can't stop thinking about it. If you ever want to know the most horrible thing that can happen to you if you ever get addicted to something that is designed to alter your perception of reality, this is a good movie to watch. (This movie can also be used to open debates amongst your friends about anti-drug laws, racial disparities, and women's issues.)...or it'll just make you cry and hate humanity and then make you depressed altogether. This movie is one of the very few I'd call an actual ""experience.""They say ""not for the squeamish,"" but I'm very squeamish and glad I stomached it out to watch it."
4,watch it.,"well i did just write something like a 300 word review and it was deleted. so here's my new one. Requiem= an absolutely amazing movie. It's the best drug movie out there. If you liked either Trainspotting or Pi, watch this. If you liked Requiem, you should like either of those. By watching this movie you'll learn more about yourself and hopefully feel better about your life. Make sure though that you are at least of age because the themes in this movie are very provocative and possibly offending. So just watch it."
5,Disturbing,"This is one hell of a movie. It simply leaves you dumb-folded after its depressing ending. The performances are outstanding, the script is very well written. You're dragged into the movie's underworld and it's hard to forget it. Everybody should see this movie."
5,READ THIS,I've read a lot of the reviews... I just wanted to say that it's not just about drug additiction - a lot of it is veered that way but it's mostly about abuse to yourself and shows you the gory details... shows you the hrash reality... shows you what poeple normally leave out. Something about this movie itself is addicting. I read the book afterwards and it was even better in the book. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.
5,Not for the faint of heart...,"First off, this is an excellent movie. The editing and cinematography is brilliant, and the soundtrack batters away at your emotions right along with the music. The movie's point will hit you hard, whether you want it to or not.That aside, this movie is hell. To call it intense is the greatest understatement. The director creates for the audience four friends. We get to know them, we feel bad for them, we want for them to be happy and succeed. And then before our very eyes, he throws them into a hellish meat-grinder of emotional and physical destruction and violation, and drags the audience down right along with them. You will not forget the last 15 minutes. They will haunt your dreams. Just hearing the soundtrack at a few intense parts makes my stomach cringe with the memory. So be warned, this movie is not for the faint hearted. But despite this, it is a movie that everyone should see it at some point in their lives.And kids, don't do drugs."
1,Sad,"Received the WRONG movie (got a cheap very old movie), apparently took him a week to find mine and ship out but that was 2 weeks ago. Very sad and hope I didn't get ripped off. Hopefully it's in the mail!"
2,Too disturbing,"I gotta say this movie was way too disturbing for me!!! It was well made, but I am having troubles getting it out of my head!!! Very heavy and not at all for weak people!"
3,Depression amplified,"The contradiction in reviews is easy enough to glean from the various comments. There is such a concentrated dose of graphicness and extreme feelings of depression conveyed from these, that the viewing will automatically trigger feelings of disgust from the average or normal person. I do not blame those who feel this is a five star film, but the other extreme seems pretty unfounded. On the other hand, I find the raves hard to believe. This is a wonderfully produced, deep, well-acted movie. A true psychological thriller. Ellen Burstyn is truly outstanding. Jennifer Connelly is beautiful and a versatile actress. Overall a very above average film with a limited degree of appeal to most people. Well worth seeing once, and I would recommend teenage viewing for the shock value. This review is regarding the directors cut."
4,Good movie...the mother did a good job,"The movie started very slow and I found myself getting bored, however, things did pick up just in time before I started to trash it. I also felt the camera work felt a big 'gimmicky' early on. The split screens, etc. felt a bit cheap and distracting.Ellen Burstyn, the mother, did a remarkable job...great,great acting all around. However I didn't vibe with the setup though..with the exception of the mother, all the Black characters seemed to to be 'vicious, evil ones' to bring drugs and destruction into the ""innocent and wholesome"" caucasian's lives..which I found a wee bit absurd.Good job!"
2,Boring but with great performances,"When I saw a short clip of Ellen Burstyn's performance while she was in the run for the Academy Awards I said to myself I had to have that movie, and after hearing how many versions there were and how to find the ""original"" one I kinda laugh at myself now.I expected yes a totally screwed-up movie about drugs etc, but I didn't expect it to be so boring. I was ready to take the disc out several times but then decided something good had to happen.I didn't understand several things, also Jennifer Connelly's characte was very unsympathetic. Even though Ellen Burstyn must have nightmares thinking of her own brilliant performance, I don't think I will even watch this movie again. It was really hard to get through, not because of the subject, but because it was boring. And the refrigerator scenes were the most dull.At least I think that if I didn't already have any wish to ever do any kind of drug, I certainly would not have it after seeing this movie. But that's just me."
4,Requiem For a Dream DVD- NEW,"I am extremely glad I ordered this movie. I could not find it in stores anywhere, and this was my last option. I like that I paid a cheaper price for it and got good quality. The shipping was great and I recieved it in an exceptable amount of time. Although I am having trouble with the orders I have placed now, but not anything major. Just need them to be here by a certain date and trying to make that happen. Other than that, this order was a great success. Thank you to whomever it concerns."
4,Great movie for the collection.,"I'm a sucker for a movie with shock value, so anything in the same vein as Requiem is on my 'watch' list. Glad to have this one at home to pull out whenever there is a guest that I want to get rid of."

1,One of the worst films I have ever seen,I could not even watch the whole movie. This is one of the most pointless and bizzare movies I have ever seen. I wish I could give it 0 stars.
3,This movie is hilarious,"Ok, at first this movie may seem really depressing and it definitely packs a punch the first time you see it, looking back at it, it's just hilarious. The problem isn't the heroin, it's that the characters are stupid."
1,Horrible!!,"This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen! Jared Leto, though an excellent musician in the groundbreaking band 30 Seconds To Mars, is a horrible actor! Ellen Burstyn, or whatever her name is, is a terrible old hack of an actress. She should be in a freaking retirement home. Jennifer Connelly is pretty awful too. The plot is boring, generic and full of Hollywood cliches. The only redeeming qualities are that Jared Leto looked totally hot and luckily realized how horrible of an actor he is so he moved on to music and made great albums."
1,No thank you,"This movie was very beutiful, but it was just too depressing. I have better ways to spend two hours than to watch something so sad."
2,"Art Maybe, Disturbing Certainly","I saw this film on the recommendation of a friend, and I admit that it does relay an extremely strong messege but it is not worth enduring the 102 minutes of disturbance. The frightening and often grotesque images combined with haunting music does more than simply relay the director's message, it forces you to come to a relization of general disgust for society. If you enjoyed ""Pie"" then you will probably enjoy ""Requiem"" but if you are not familiar with either movie or the director then I would advise you to take caution when choosing to watch this movie, especially around children."
1,A LITTLE SOMETHING TO OFFEND EVERYONE!,"I'm a broad minded, artsy person. I thoughr this film was the most offensive thing I've seen in years. And it wasn't even interesting. Which is kinda strange! It was ""boring - drugs - boring - offensive sex - boring - drugs, etc."" Yuch! If you do watch it, check out a second tape to clean you out. I picked Sense and Sensibility and it worked."
1,Bourgeois carnival view of addicton.,"RFOD is fun to watch for its music video, remember those?, hyper-style fireworks, but the film just uses Selby's novel, which is truly bleak and which actually gets under your skin, for a bourgeois carnival ride into neon addiction hell that never even pops your skin...at all.This movie is simply MADE for frat boys who want to feel ""deep,"" as was PI and as is BS, oh, that's BLACK SWAN. Nothing against DA, I'm not a hater, but he needs to get a bit of real-life experience or SOMETHING else that actually engages him, the artist, with his material in a genuine way. Great performances, though, especially by Burstyn, Connolly & Wayans."
1,PRETENTIOUS DRIVEL,"[insert quaff about ""MTV-style editting"" here][insert clever quip like ""depressing = bad"" here]"
1,Turd-tastic,"If you actually think that this is an intelligent, well-made, non-gimmick-laden film with real insights into drug addiction about actual flesh and blood characters that you can empathize with, you are an idiot.Up there with Dancer in the Dark in the running for most outrageuosly over-rated and pretentiously God-awful movie EVER.Masochists may get a kick out of it..."
1,"A pretentious hack job convincing the world that its ""art""","Ten billion cuts with the same in-your-face imagery, possibly the worst acting job of all time (Leto, et al), and a self-indulgent sense of its own alleged ""brilliance,"" this worthless tripe was possibly the biggest scam in cinema over the past several years.I have never finished watching a movie in a such a state of anger at having been duped, conned, and beaten with the pretentious stick so mercilessly. Many have hailed this monstrosity as ""compelling"" and ""disturbing."" The only thing that is disturbing is the fact that this crap is considered cutting edge independent ""art.""Why people? Why??? Why have you been convinced that if you just hack away in the editing room, show drug usage, and go for pointless shock value that that somehow qualifies as deep, meaningful art? There are so many great alternative and independent films out there, and this is not one of them. This is a colossal work of crap."
3,"Fantastically filmed, but waaaay depressing","If you like sobering material like ""Leaving Las Vegas"" you might enjoy this film. Then again, Leaving Las Vegas at least had some vestige of hope for it's characters. This one most definitely does not. I give it three stars, not because it's not a five star movie (the film is beautifully shot, it's sound design is suburb -- for any person who enjoys film simply for it's exploration of the medium, this is a must-see) but because it leaves you with that sick feeling in your stomach, a sense of deep sorrow (think ""Kids"", another movie I'm still recovering from). Worth seeing? yes. Ever want to see it again? About as much as I want a punch in the gut."
5,one of my favorites,"If you like movies you will like this. Theres great acting, a great story line, and an excellent director. You have to see this movie at least once in your life. Very realistic."
3,Bleak,"This movie was incredibly bleak. Do not watch it if you are looking for a pick me up. The story line is interesting enough, but be prepared for the blaring feeling that you are watching a movie from the 90's. After all is said and done, I appreciated the raw representation of drugs and addiction."
5,Life changing Film,This powerful movie is a unusually strange slice of life for four people that we watch as their dreams slowly deteriorate. This is a strong film that will mean different things to different individuals. I haven't been the same since viewing it. It is also not like any other film I've seen. I haven't deciphered the entire movie after a second viewing.
3,"Good, but very overated","Requiem for a Dream is a very well directed movie, as it is very visually stunning. The acting is also top notch, although there is very little depth to the characters. The problem I have with the film is the fact that everyone seems to proclaim this movie as the most powerful film of all time. For a person who has actually been apart of, or knows anything about the heroin scene, Requiem for a Dream will not be effective at all, in terms of scaring them away from drugs. Realism is completely sacrificed for shock value, to the point where it seems like Requiem was produced by the government as an anti drug film. Though it has setbacks, Requiem is, however, worth watching for the acting and the slick visuals. The film also makes you think. I would give Requiem 3.5 stars if I could, as it is a good movie. Just think for yourself and do not take the happenings of Requiem as the gospal."
5,Its amazing,"This movie is deep, it touches you on the inside, after watching it you feel like you are nothing, your probelms are childish and you dont belong on this earth...not great feelings, but i have never been touched so deeply by any movie, it seems so real, but at the same time you dont want to believe that these things can actually happen to people...If you think that there is a chance you will like this movie, BUY IT, you will never regret it, the movie it great... THOUGH replay value is limiting cause its hard to put yourself through those emotions again, unless you're trying to introduce the movie to other people."
5,Requiem of a dream,"I love crazy movies and I thought this was well written and performed. I never would have guessed the outcome. I love movies where I have to say ""how are they ever going to end this movie"" and the ending turns out shocking!"
2,haven't seen it AND...,"I work at a shelter. A resident brought this in to watch, after watching she relapsed. I kid you not. True story. So...watch it for the movie, but not for information on how to stay sober...I'm shopping for movies that will help people with their addictions, not make them want to use."
1,Just another film student's practium,"I watched Pi at least 5 times and loved it. Even though Pi is more of a low budget student film, it is visually interesting, clever, and SINCERE. But this one, just plain bad. I don't know what is the filmmaker trying to prove here...maybe he was a good film student and knows all the cheap camera tricks? Mr. Director, why do you have to copy Scorsese or some other filmmakers' shots over and over again? Where are your originality and guts? You can fool the world but not yourself man!"
1,Annoying...,"I guess I'm in the minority on this one, but I think Aronofsky once again missed the mark with Requiem. Like Pi, what could have been a better movie was ruined by the heavy-handed directing and a story that just doesn't hold together.This movie was filled with way too many idiots for my taste. That much stupidity and tragedy in the story just made it seem ludicrous and over-the-top...I also got very tired of the high-speed montage sequences.To it's credit, I thought Kronos Quartet's music added an interesting facet to the movie. Burstyn's and Wayans' acting was also very good. The tragedy of this movie is that in the end, it really didn't have anything convincing to share with the audience. My advice is that Aronofsky should work with a good director before attempting to make another film on his own. Please, people! Don't encourage him. ;-)"
1,now here's an insult!,"In this spectacularly terrible flick the director puts his characters on a rollercoaster ride through a cardboard version of what hell is supposed to be like when people envision it when they are about 12 years old, and in one hand the director holds a knife putting it on the viewers' throats warning them to ""Really get shocked now, OR ELSE..."" and his other hand is on his crotch, masturbating over how he thinks he knows a thousand ways to traumatize the masses into addoration...the only thing that shocks me here is how he actually manages to get the masses on their knees, scary!"
5,Wtf!?,"Crazy. Twisted. Real. Heartbreaking.....I l.o.v.e.d it. Takes you on a trip to somewhere you're curious about but don't want to ho,"
3,for a Dream,"The acting is great, the dialogue is less so, the method of getting you to feel like you are the addict is the best feature. A thrill ride to hell.The story is a non sequitur, it simply makes no sense for a large part of the film, particularly the ending. The ending was almost expected, more or less. Where is the story? I like a good story, I do not think this flick had one. Sort of like having an inside view of an addict's life, with some improbabilities thrown in for shock effect."
1,Please Read The Book,"As I have said in my title PLEASE READ THE BOOK, because the book brillantly breaks down the individual struggle of each character as they dive deeper and deeper into drug addiction. The book deals with alot of inward thought and emotions, which is hard to capture in film. Even though Hubert Selby Jr. (the original author) was involved in the making of this film I believe it could have been executed better."
2,Good Acting skills..but boring movie,"Just saw it after a friend recommended it and hearing about how good this film is, the story is VERY lame. Bunch of high life kids doing and selling drugs..immature. Wasted my 2 hours watching this stupid film. Btw, I'm giving this movie away free to the next person whoever wants it, because I want this out of my hands. Maybe the next person will appreciate it more. I was about to give this movie a 1 star but gave two because of the acting. Overall, will not watch it again unlike some of the viewers here. This is such a depressing film."
3,"Far too melodramatic, but insightful","I found Requiem for a Dream to be a tad overrated, but still interesting to watch.If anything, it teaches that Poverty creates crime, and NOT that drugs are inherently evil. If the person who wrote the script for this made it solely to spew out anti-Drug propaganda for 90 minutes, then shame on them...but I'm not going to speculate the true intentions from the start.For those that aren't easily (or ever, for that matter) offended, I suggest you check the movie out and see it for yourself."
2,Muddled Mess,"This could be a good movie, but the choppy editing and uneven story made it difficult to enjoy. There are some good performances by the stars of the film, but they don't overcome the poor story line. If you don't have it, don't buy it."
2,Hyperbole Galore with MTV Video style director,"This is a midly entertaining film that explores addiction. It also shares the same downfall as ""Magnolia"". Requiem for a Dream is a much better film than Magnolia however in the sense that there is purpose and a statement in the film. Magnolia OTOH, was a beautifully directed terrible film with characters that nobody can hopefully identify with (""Magnolia"" had no real meaning or plot to anybody but the self-serving director and a few others who managed to hallucinate some meaning out of ""Magnolia"". Traffic was an outstanding movie on addiction, while Requiem for a dream relied on too much hyperbole and SHOCK effect, as if it were an MTV video. I think it was worth watching once, perhaps, but it is does not have a lot to offer. Traffic OTOH was either 4 or 5 stars out of 5. This film does not deserve more than 2 to 3 stars."
4,Trippy but powerful,"""Requiem for a Dream"" should be required viewing for those high-school poseurs who think drugs are hip and cool. If the film's final 30 minutes don't discourage you from a life of drugs and addiction, then you are simply insane. A great, career-reviving performance from Ellen Burstyn, and Jaerd Leto and Marlon Wayans are in top form as well. The DVD has features galore, including a commentary, interviews, trailers, and a making-of featurette. Not for the fainthearted."
5,"Imaginitive, disturbing and dark","This film is gripping from the beginning. Rich in beautiful acting, directing, scenery and writing, this film is probably also the most depressing movie I have ever seen. Each character is destroyed by the end- left in a lifelong hell that will not subside. This movie is so wonderful in its creation yet so dark in its message and final product. After I finished watching this film, I couldn't move. I was surprised, sickened and stunned by the violence that Aronofsky portrays as the end result of drug use. I highly recommend this film to anyone. Its horror is the key to its message and though it is disturbing, it is worth the pain of watching to see this film and its tragedy."
2,Stylized Anti-Drug Snuff Film - Pure Propaganda and Very Well Done.,"A disturbing fantasy that punishes drug addicts as if they were mass murderers. While very well acted and well written, when all is said and done, this film is a type of anti-drug propaganda that extreme right-wing extremists would be proud of. Reference Riefenstah's Triumph of the Will. If you like this film, I recommend the Faces of Death series."
1,Utter trash,"This movie is overhyped, period. It's utter trash, just like David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"". The only bright spot about it is that Jennifer Connelly stars in it."
1,If only I could give it a 0,"This movie tried too hard, tried to be cool, tried to be artistic, tried to be dirty and it missed its mark everytime.I dont even know if the actors did a good job because the camera would never hold still long enough. If u want to see a real movie about drugs or the streets buy Trainspotting or Kids"
1,What did I just watch?,"What a flaming turd. It made no sense. You have to be on drugs yourself to appreciate this movie. It was listed under horror in Unbox and that must be because it's a horrible movie. I'd like my money and 2 hours of my life back, Amazon."
1,Terrible!,"Simply terrible, I can't believe how much hype this movie is generating. It's not that good. I don't know how many people say that this is the best director ever. Ellen Burstyn does a good job, but she is the one who is carrying the movie, no one else is doing something that can be pointed as good in this movie."
5,Requiem For Dream,"Marlon Wayans, Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, and Jennifer Connolly. the amazing four.Harry(Jared) is a junkie that is living with his mom. One day, him and his bestfriend Ty(Marlon) gets into sellin pure coke and starts to make money. And there's Harry's gf, Marion.Harry's mom, who seems to have obsession about being in a spotlight, is infatuated with a tv show called The Juice.sound effects and transitions, etc. they were just amazing. this movie is truly something check it out"
5,"Very Raw, Very REAL!!","Excellent interpretation of what loneliness & lack of hope can become; SO raw, so intense that you can barely take your eyes of the screen. Aronofsky swings between two parallel stories with the SAME meaning so smoothly that it seems like an italian opera. He interprets what you can make the center of your life...it can be drugs as it can be HOPE. Excellent effects, excellent sounds (the airplane one is awesome!). Jeniffer is a delight of natural beauty & an incredible actress (Knew it from ROCKETEER). Leto is a natural gem; I believe that ELLEN BURSTYN deserves an OSCAR for her roll(she was soo intense & realistic). This type of movie is what defines THE ART OF CINEMA...Shaping feelings & thoughts on a screen. FOUR THUMBS UP ARONOFSKY!!...Keep it like that and you'll become the ""KUBRICK of the century""."
5,Be Prepared For Sleepless Nights...,"Requiem for a Dream is the most powerful movie I have ever seen. It isn't glamorous and you must be ready to be disturbed. This movie is the first movie I have seen that truly depicts what drugs are and what they can do. The acting is truly AMAZING... This isn't a 'dolled up' hollywood film, this is real; so for those of you who found ""Traffic"" or ""Blow"" disturbing should not see this movie."
4,Shock Theater,"There is no question that Aronofsky is a brilliant filmmaker-- this film is hypnotic and utterly gripping in every sense. The actors, particularly Ellen Burstyn (who deserved an Oscar), are brilliant. If you ever need reasons NOT to do drugs of any kind, see this movie. It certainly raises new possibilities for the medium of film, because I've seen a lot of them and there aren't many that leave you feeling the way you do after seeing this one. How do you feel? Numb, depressed, hopeless-- in short, the film makes you feel like a junkie. The experience of seeing dilating pupils, shooting needles and Jared Leto's festering arm (nothing in film has ever made me cringe like that) is not unlike Burstyn's grotesque shock therapy. The movie is like being bludgeoned-- in a good, cathartic way, if that makes any sense. See it for the experience and see Aronofsky's brilliance firsthand, but I'll only see it again if I feel like punishing my mind."
5,I will never forget this movie.....,"I came across this movie by accident at blockbuster. I put it in the dvd player really not knowing what to expect. I don't know what to say about this movie. I have never been affected so much by a film. After the film was over I was kind of paralized. I was filled with so much emotion. You cannot help but feel the characters pain. I must recognize this film for what it really is, a piece of art. If you watch this film sit down and be ready to let it sink in.Harry crying: No....She won't come.I can never expect to feel the same way after watching another film."
3,Professional but...,Everything about this film is perfect. from acting to scenario and also the music of the film; it's masterpiece. but this film is one of the most depressing film i've ever seen so i gave it 3.5 stars
4,I'd rate it higher but it's so brutally depressing.,"Great acting, compelling story, thoughtful dialogue. All the things that make for a great film..... except it was so head poundingly depressing I wanted to nip off to the kitchen and off myself. Sheesh. I recommend this film for those people who are so bright and chipper all the time (you know who you are) that nothing can bring them down."
4,Case was torn,"This is my favorite movie and someone stole my copy. So of course I had to get a new one. It plays well, but my case was torn and my cover insert was also torn, which made me a little mad."
1,Even Jennifer Connelly in the buff can't help this disgrace,"Sad, because the film has some good ideas and camerawork, but it all adds up to horrible, pretentious arthouse dogdoo. Ellen Burstyn is remarkable as always, and in fact, the acting is not really to be faulted on any count. But this is just another glorification of violence, cheap sex and drugs (and hey-- I like all those things, but I like there to be a justification for their existence in a movie...)that ends up in a big messpile that just left me hollow and feeling dismal. Neither fun nor serious, just pretentious and silly. Don't give this movie two hours of your life. It won't give you anything back and you'll never recover the wasted time."
1,Waste of time,"This movie is completely hollow. It's about a group of drug addicts whose lives go down the drain - either ending in death, insanity, hospitalization, or hooking.I guess the lesson or theme is that drugs are bad for you. Gee, how original."
2,overated,"i bought this movie after friends told me to watch it because it was ""my kind of movie""...after reading the reviews here, i decided to buy it because they didn't have it for me to rent at any of the video stores in my area. i really tried to like it, but i didn't. there are many other movies about this subject that make this movie pale in comparison. it's overated..rent it before you buy it if you can"
1,Watch Out- Feel Lousy,"You think life could not be any worse. Take all the bad things in this world drugs, prostitution, abuse, hate, anger, addiction, and pure fear and roll them into an ""in your face reality...then call it Requiem for a Dream.""I had to put another movie on after this movie ended finally. I did not want to go to bed with this film on my mind. I truly fear what my sunconscious has done with it. It will leave you in a bad mental place. I do give him credit for his direction and editing as the ONLY good things about this film. It case you did not get it. I don't like this movie nor would I ever recommend this film to anyone unless they are meant to be tortured."
1,Horrible!,"I have had a crush on Jennifer Connelly for years. In fact, I married a girl named Jennifer and forced her to have plastic surgery to look like Jennifer Connelly. No just kidding. I did buy this movie for her though as she has been so awesome in her other roles. She did a fine acting job...the movie just sucked! If you plan on buying it, at least rent it before you buy it. Of course, if you decide to buy it, drop me a line. I watched mine once and don't think I could stomach it again."
1,I expected better from Aronofsky,"This movie is a 2-hour cliche. Detailing the downward spiral of heroine users is NOT an original, or even noteworthy, endeavour. These characters were losers when the movie started and they were even bigger losers at the end. Many reviewers will give accolades for the effects used here. Fast-motion, slow-motion, tight frames, split screens, etc. These were mildly interesting the first time they're used but quickly become annoying by mid-movie. And will someone take that harness camera away from Darren!! The only interesting element of this movie was Ellen Burstyn's character. Ellen deserves all the praise she has received for ther portrayal. Everyone else involved should apologize."
5,Harrowing Magnificence,"I have never seen such stark reality from a motion picture. Its story is beautiful, tragic and shocking. Arnofsky is definitely a director to look for in the future. Selby has created a giant of a tale, but one that is all too familiar to America. Requiem grabs you by the neck and forces you to observe the crashing spiral of four people, all diluded by their estranged desires. All seeking a hapiness out of reach, by any means necessary. Even as their paths lead them to inevitable damnation and misery.This film gives us an introspective to ourselves, whether or not you are involved in drugs. Are you in control of your dreams, or do they control you ?"
2,Not what I would suggest.,"this movie is not a very good one. I didn't get it at first, but then the stories were really sad and had no positive endings. I didn't like this one"
1,Award winning twaddle,"One of the worst films of the past decade. Pauline Kael had it right. Aranofsky is the type of director who relies on visual gimmicks rather than connecting with the actors and telling a story. This film presumes to be a reflection of his own experiences. In some interviews, he claimed seeing first hand situations such as Connelly's underground strip club scene. The film has the feel of someone with limited life experience, or at least someone with no concept of storytelling. One of the longest ninety minutes I've ever spent."
1,"Traffic, minus a plot","If you've seen Traffic, don't bother watching Requiem for a Dream. The story? A few people have dreams of living a better life, but are ruined by drug abuse. The End. Near unwatchable. And I didn't even get to see Jennifer Connelly's wonderful breasts!"
2,One Of The Best Movies,Wow !! This movie is awesome. The Director improves his work from Pi to this one.... I love the way he tells the story by gently pulling you into this world of chaos in such a way that you don't even realize what has overtaken you. He takes you into the world of these four characters and lets you see and feel things like they do. ...this movie is unstoppable.
5,"""Feed me, Sara...""","The first time I saw Requiem for a Dream I was a little shaken to my core, the second time I watched it, I realized what a work of art this movie is. The story of four very different drug addicts is disturbing and yet fascinating to say the least. The last 10 minutes are the most graphic but the most important. Jared Leto's performance is the best I have ever seen from him, and of course it's Ellen Burstyn who steals the show. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are superb as well, Requiem for a Dream is a film no one should overlook. It's gritty, heartbreaking, honest, and this movie stays with you, now that's a great and profound film! I highly recommend it!"
4,"yes, it's worth seeing again!","It's true that this movie is brutal and harrowing by the end, (one friend's review of the movie was ""It's great, but when the title 'Winter' comes up, I recommend just running out of the theater screaming then. It'll save time.""), leading many to say one would never want to see it a second time.Perhaps, but the movie is made so well, that it really does reward multiple viewings. Also, the commentary tracks provided by the director and cinematographer are interesting and do a good job of pointing out subtleties of craft that you may not have consciously picked up on when viewing on your own.I have my quibbles with the film, and suspect the ending is a little too Grand Guignol-ish for its own good, but the all-around solid-to-amazing acting, the musical approach to editing and composition, and the creativity and innovation of the director make this one a keeper for me."
5,Review of blu ray transfer,"This is a not a review of the movie, we know how great it is already, but of the blu ray transfer. I did side by side comparison, and blu ray is absolutely stunning improvement from upscaled dvd (w/ HDMI). The extras/bonuses from the dvd are same on blu ray. However, I was more used to the menu layout in the dvd, hence I'm keeping both copies.Dreaming of this flick? Definitely a Requiem for blu ray copy."
2,Oh Please,"Like the director's first film, Pi, this film is a lesson in heavy handedness. Just like Pi, Requiem is tremendously overrated. Also, it is a great example of how to let an annoyingly hip soundtrack destroy a movie.Basically, we learn that drugs are bad. So bad in fact, that you will turn into a whore, your arm will fall off and appliances will attack you if you do them. Also, if you take what otherwise looks just like a Gap ad and do lots of close ups and quick cuts, the general movie going public will consider you ""deep"".Pass."
3,torn,"This is one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen, and will never watch it again. With that said, it was brilliantly filmed. Darren Aronofsky is really never a let down. but !@#$, this movie, ug. Make sure you're emotionally prepared, hah. I give it a 3 because I feel like Darren is way to brilliant to be dragging people down, he should put his energy into more creative movies like the fountain, in my opinion."
3,what?,"i honestly dont think that this was a very good movie. my main focus though was on the search. i searched for pie. What did i get? i got requiem for a dream. huh? how did that happen? the directors name, the name of the movie...nothing has to do with pie. darn...thats annoying. honestly, i didnt like this movie. i thought it was way too weird. it made me think about the meaning of life. i didnt want to think about the meaning of life. its boring."
2,just no,"this movie is hardly a masterpiece. Please don't preach about the directing in this movie, it doesn't take a genius to build up suspense with such a blantantly obvious plot. How could things not go wrong with a group of people all getting mixed up with drugs. This is like a childrens book mixed up with Shakespeare. The only reason it is so popular is because anyone including my 4 year old nephew can piece together the symbolism and themes of this movie. This movie reminds me of Romeo and Juliet, although a thousand times better than this movie, because it is so widely read and hailed only because it is the easiest Shakespeare to identify with and analyze. I feel bad even comparing Romeo and Juliet to this horrible movie because it has that much more meaning and storyline to it than RFAD. Only buy this movie if you are interessted in learning about the falsified drug world pictured here or you want to scare people into not doing drugs."
3,fancy camera work,"This movie hits you over the head-repeatedly. After a while though, it gets fatiguing. It takes more than technique to make a story! The acting is great, the dialogue is less so, the method of getting you to feel like you are the addict is the best feature. A thrill ride to hell.The story is a non sequitur, it simply makes no sense for a large part of the film, particularly the ending. The ending was almost expected, more or less. Where is the story? I like a good story, I do not think this flick had one. Sort of like having an inside view of an addict's life, with some ridiculous improbabilities thrown in for shock effect. Worth watching once, after that forget it."
1,Rubbish,"There are compelling things about this film that others have commented on: more power to them. From an objective and pragmatic point of view, this film was rubbish. It's about drug abuse. So what? It's not entertaining, nor thought provoking. What it IS, however, is disturbing and disgusting: coming from a horror fan, that's saying a lot. There's absolutely no reason to ever watch this film again. Sure, people go through bad things like the events portrayed in this film, but having once seen it (regrettably so), I would not recommend it, nor watch it ever again. That is my primary means of estimating the rating of a film, on my desire to watch it again. 1-star."
2,Emotional Sickness,"I am not weak and I like movies that can emote remote depressive feelings in me. Somehow this movie with absolutely impacting dark nature didnt manage to entertain me. Sometimes our sub conscious mind exerts extreme nightmares on our brain and there are times when we feel we just came out of the worst feeling ever.I have once felt the same feeling of drowning within yourself and yet everything being more unreal than comprehension. I have not seen a more dark film in my life. The best way to describe it is ""black"" owing to its extreme....A certain character in the film rots in the worst way. A fridge can be extreme torture. I really felt emotionally sick while watching those scenes. However I somehow could not contain myself in that period of time where I saw the film.PLEASE READ:However I noticed a lot of people liked this film but in my (not)humble opinion, watch this if you know what addiction can do and are willing to see something of as dark nature as this.Enjoy what works"
2,No Idea,"My daughter says she loved the movie. I collect movies so I brought it and watched it. Maybe I'm to old but, seemed to me lke a pointless movie about whats wrong with life. Maybe that was the point? Worth watching once so rent it don't buy it."
3,"heh, well I liked the title","Well, this is going to sound cliché, but this movie just didn't have enough substance. Well, the right kind of substance for me anyway. I wasn't necessarily bored by it like I am by a lot of other so called great movies, this was actually pretty fun to watch as it was visually captivating, but unfortunately in the end ended up being a pretty average story.There wasn't enough for me to care about, it's ""just"" a story about the consequences of doing drugs, there weren't really any interesting subplots or anything that was explored. With a premise like that, I would've preferred seeing how destructive drugs could be to friendships, relationships, etc.I can just add this to my list of over-hyped movies I've seen that was supposed to be amazing, but only succeeded in mildly entertaining me. Unfortunately, this list is growing at an alarming rate."
2,Heavy-handed with nothing at all to recommend it,"While lonely widow Burstyn goes on a downward spiral to hell after becoming addicted to television and diet pills, her son, along with his friend and girlfriend suffer the same treatment through their addictions to heroine. Starts off with the flimsy hollowness of a sophisticated soap opera, then becomes nothing more than one long, heavy-handed, unwatchable drug trip, focusing more on creating heinously grotesque visuals rather than actually adding any new insight to the topic except ""drugs ruin your life"". Although this was celebrated by many, some may strike this as being Aronofsky's unforgivable excuse for making a purely ugly, shock-fest. Drug addiction depicted as bombastic and visualistic without creating any sense of true realism. Watch at own risk."
2,Before you watch this movie ...,"Before you watch this movie, here is something to think about ...Most people who watch it consider it to be bleak and depressing. Others, who were not moved by the plight of the characters just found it boring and annoying.So it seems like the very best you can possibly hope for after watching this movie is to feel bored and annoyed. Well, I'll give it 2 stars because I guess some people probably need to see it. I mean, if you're actually dumb enough to consider using, then maybe there's something in it for you. Otherwise, if watching a movie about people destroying their lives via drug addiction doesn't sound like your idea of a good time, I'd give it a pass.But if you still want to see this movie, I'd just rent it. It's sort of like watching a documentary about the Nazi concentration camps and the horrors therein; I can't imagine why any person who is not emotionally disturbed would want to watch it more than once."
1,No Good,"I don't know who wrote the other reviews on this book, but I paint and draw and I have purchased a lot of books on art instruction, and this is one of the worst I have ever seen. I sent the book back to Amazon because it was so bad. I have only sent one other book back to Amazon and that includes over a hundred I have purchased over the years.This book offers nothing to the artist. The book is a presentation of the artist's work and not much more. All the glowing reports of teaching you how to paint negative space are fine, but that is about all the book shows the student. And you can learn a lot more about negative space in Drawing On The Right Side of the Brain and Keys to Drawing than you can learn here.If you want to look at paintings by this artist (Linda Kemp) go ahead and buy the book, but if you are looking for art instruction look elsewhere."
5,My Favorite Artist's Information Book,"Many books that offer information to artists who wish to learn are a disappointment. Sometimes they promise more than they deliver. Not this book. It delivers more than it promises. I bought this book because I wished to learn about ""negative painting,"" an elusive technique (to me), but I discovered that it could teach me much about watercolor techniques composition, drawing, color, and more as well. What I like best about this book are the writer's carefully worded and illustrated discriptions of technique. In my experience, the best ever. I have thought that this could be a book for a young person with no experience because it is so clear. I have a lot of experience, but I need this book. Mary Alice Strom"
3,WAtercolor Painting Outside the Lines,"This book is informative, but really does not give any more information on negative painting than the average Watercolor book with a section on negative painting....might be good for a rank beginner...and should be advertised as such.Over all fair."
4,"Review of ""Outside the Lines""",The book was sent promptly and in perfect ccndition. The book is beautifully illustrated with concise lessons.
3,Pretty Good,"As other reviewers have noted, this is an okay watercolor reference and how-to book. Most of the knowledge here is pretty basic, and some of the tutorials are kind of a yawn.Still, the pictures are very nice and, I think, a significant inspiration. I had already had the chance to look through this book elsewhere, and I wanted to buy it despite the lack of ground-breaking content or variety. Sometimes you just need a bit of inspiration. For me, the painting style here presented wouldn't offer enough variety to keep me interested for long, but it does have great appeal and should prove useful when used as an element of a larger work, rather than always being made into the whole work."
2,Watercolor painting outside the lines: a positive approach t,"I ordered this book December 18, 2004. I looked at it for a few days and sent the book back to Amazon. It was not appropriate to Watercolor techniques. It was more for a craft or a stenciler."
3,Average,"The title really does sum up the book. However, in the attempt to cover both aspects of a broad topic the book fails to cover either aspect in depth.You do get color pictures of many tools and hardware products, although the focus is on tools and products used for home repair or remodeling. Additionally nearly all of the skills covered focus on home repair and remodeling.I find that other books from Reader's digest give better coverage of home repair and remodeling. Although possibly useful for a novice, I find that the tool coverage is neither interesting nor exhaustive. The split personality and homeowner focus leaves this book with an average rating."
3,"Decent cordless vac, but battery will die","While this is a good cordless vacuum, I would recommend the Versa Pack version (VP7240) instead of this model. They're identical vacs, but the Versa Pack uses the standard B&D battery pack system - so you can replace the batteries when they eventually die. We've had this model for about 12 months and the batteries hold a very small charge."
4,Powerful and Does the Job,"This is a great little gadget that every household could use. I dont even own a dust pan anymore because after I sweep I just suck up all the dust with this.It's not bad to clean either..just take it apart, shake out dirt in trash, run parts uder hot water (the parts that can get wet) and dry. Not hard to reassemble. The only thing keeping me from rating it at 5 stars is I get annoyed reconnecting it to the charging base. I never seem to get it on the first try..has to be lined up just right."
1,stinks,"batteries. this is a great product killed by now having internal batteries. versapak version was great, but this ""next generation"" model just doesn't hack it. you can take my word on it."
4,Good product that will last a good 6 years....,"We got one in 1991 and it finally died in 97. Got this one and picks up where the other left off.Nice to have when you have young children, 3 and under and they like to make messes!"
2,DISPOSABLE Duster,"Black&Decker should mention in LARGE print that although this vacuum is rechargeable, the rechargeable battey eventually loses its charge and is not replaceable -- mine lasted less than a year (I used it 10 minutes a week on average).Unfortunately, I recycled the battery pack before I learned I needed it to get a replacement unit under the warranty.Also, B&D website was dense and hard to navigate. I had to contact their phone support (which only operates M-F) to find out I had worthless piece of garbage.I would recommend another model or, for me, another brand."
4,"intelligent, inspired","The first song alone, ""World's Greatest Lover"" is worth the price of admission. Put on your thinking cap and get out your dictionary. Lines like ""I've got the rabies/I'll love you like no other"" are dark and brilliant, reminding one of Nick Cave's ""Do You Love Me (like I love you)"". This album is so much more than just straight ahead rock with the guitars turned up. It's thought out, angry, poignant, encouraging, and all with a good tune too. Buzzard and Rollercoaster are easy to listen to rock staples, and Murder an Angel is a soft confessional. Highly recommended! Plus check out there live show if possible too!"
4,Not used,"Bought this for my system, but never hooked it up. Still in box. Cannot leave any feedback on how it works. Received it quickly and in great condition though."
2,Not all I expected,"I bought this product about a year ago and have been nothing but disapointed. I had an older Onkyo receiver that I was absolutely delighted with and I wanted to move up to one with more features. Unfortunately, the older less powerful unit would have been the one to keep. The FM sound is horrible on the new unit. This unit is hardly used except for DVD and VCR movies. Save your money and go with a Yamaha or Denon."
4,Important if you never had a good/kind/warm relationship with your father/father-figure.......,"I only gave it a 4 outta 5 'cause I had already discovered for myself what most of this book discusses. I heartily recommend this for anyone, especially women, who haven't had a healthy father figure growing up."
5,Hint: Flip the Button Assignments,"This is a great product. It takes up very little space, it is ambidextrous, it is ergonomic, and it works very smoothly. I use it almost exclusively now -- I have one for my desk at home, one for my personal laptop, and three for my work laptop (one for home, one for the office docking station, and one to travel around the office building). After a pretty short learning period, my family had no issues using it.I wish there was a more portable model with a shorter cable.My big recommendation: flip the primary button assignments. This will allow you to rest your palm against the table with your wrist and arm in a NEUTRAL position. Use your index or middle finger to navigate with the ball, and your middle or ring finger to ""left"" click. Use your thumb to ""right"" click."
5,awesome,"Once again Logitech makes an amazing product. Previously I had been using the right-handed Trackman, but over the years my right hand has become sore when I use it too often, so I started looking at this type of trackball.The lack of the scroll wheel bothered me a bit so I ended up getting a Kensington Turbo Trackball which did have a scroll wheel. Big mistake that was!! Its design is so inferior to this Logitech, the ball falls out way too easily, and the scroll wheel is totally useless. What a waste of cash!I didn't hesitate to pick up one of these instead and I knew as soon as I plugged it in that I should have gone with this one right from the start. The size is perfect and it's very easy to use in either hand. Your hand will curve around the body very naturally, and little movement of the fingers is needed to control the ball. GREAT product, I'll be getting more for the rest of my comps soon!"
1,Discontinued,This item is a discontinued item and if you have a problem Logitech will not help you. Suggest you get the less expensive one which IS still manufactured.
2,Mouse is good but software is stupid !!!,"Mouse itself is pretty good. I brought it because this trackball can be used with left hand. But then I found the logitech SetPoint software is stupid! If you use left hand, you will surely be annoyed! Every time after I reboot my computer, this software persist in changing my ""switch buttons"" setting in windows! This means you can only swap left and right buttons in the SetPoint software, and can only swap the buttons on this Logitech Mouse. If you have two mouses, this becomes a big problem. Now I use this mouse on my laptop, and I cannot always set to swap buttons on this mouse and on my laptop touchpad simultaneously! I have to change this setting in windows EVERY time I reboot!And also the ""universal scroll"" is not so good. It's too fast in my IE, even I have set it to the lowest scroll speed."
2,None,See other reviews. Does what it says it would do. I like other mice better such as glidepoint mouse products.
5,WOmen love this mouse!,"We have had 4 Logitech ergo dynamic mice over the years and I am about to purchase this one again. We love it and the price cant be beat.If you have never had one before there is a short period of adjustment.I am disabled with shoulder and neck injuries and this product greatly reduces arm, back and neck muscles while using a PC. If you have had carpal tunnel it helps a lot to! We think this is the best mouse ever!They last and last and are easy to clean. They hardly ever wear out, we broke one and a bird bit the cord in half on the other. 3 of the 4 PC users in my home prefer Logitech mice after using them for a week."
4,good choice for a mouse,"This mouse is a good choice for those who don't want to keep lugging a ""mouse"" all over the desk. The only issue is it takes a little while to get used to the trackball thingy...but in general its pretty easy to use and once you get used to it is nearly indispensible. On my comp though the right and left scroll buttons were not recognized :( even though I put in the driver CD.In any case this is a reasonably priced mouse which I think is pretty good at its job. However for gamers.. may not be the optimum choice"
4,This is a good one,"This one works well for me; I like the large ball, the way it fits under my (average sized) hand and the smoothness of the action. It took me a while to get used to the little scroll buttons, but now I can activate them without thinking about it."
2,Returned it; couldn't get used to index finger trackball,I had this less than a day when I returned the product and went back to a traditional thumb-based trackball. I couldn't get used to the placement of the ball under the index finger and just couldn't get the kind of pointer precision I needed. Plus it felt uncomfortable. A lot of reviewers love this item but any individual should try it out first in an actual work environment to see if it is right or wrong for them.
5,Best Trackball mouse ever,"Since my thumb is not the most dexterous digit, I wanted a mouse where I could use my index finger to navigate. This mouse is the best I've ever had, by far. With the two smaller buttons which you can map to whatever you desire, that makes this mouse more versatile than any I've used before. The cost also makes this a super good buy. At $20, you will be hard pressed to find another trackball that can do what this one can do. I highly recommend this to anyone."
5,Logitech Trackball:Barble mouse Optical LOG9043600403,"LOVE IT, closest thing I have found to my old trusty track ball (made by logitech too, but cant buy it due to its 400 price tag, which was 80 when i bought it, man that thing can last!)Anyway, its easy to use, feels good and best of all its cheap!Great buy, I highly recommand it."
3,"works fine, but...","I purchased this for my wife, who has had carpal tunnel problems in the past. The device works fine, and she liked that the trackball was centrally mounted. However, and this is a BIG however, there is no scroll wheel. Considering she spends most of her computing time on the Internet, this thing is pretty much worthless and went back in the package the same day it was opened. Is it the product's fault or manufacturer's fault that we didn't notice there was no scroll wheel? Certainly not. But it sure became noticeable when we tried using it for the first time."
3,no frills but works very well,This trackball works very well - however there is no scroll feature and for me the buttons are awkwardly placed.
5,best mouse ever!,"I've had this mouse for a few years and its never failed me once,i have even dropped it many times and the ball would bounce around and it still works the same. (yes, I'm a klutz)I've used it and so have a couple of other people in my family and we've never wanted to use another mouse. i love the touch buttons that help you go back and forth in pages without having to go to the actually back/forth buttons. BUY IT NOW! you wont regret it!"
1,Not good for smaller hands,Do not buy this mouse or other Logitechs with similar designs if you have small hands. The long sloping design will strain your wrist. Even with a wrist rest. I found the only way to avoid wrist strain was to duct tape the wrist rest on to the track ball about halfway up.
2,Not reliable hardware,"I've owned two of these and both have failed in the same way. While they work, they work very well, but in each case, starting at about the 6 month mark and getting progressively worse from then on, they become erratic. Clicks don't register, sometimes ""ghost"" clicks show up - it feels like I'm using a ""sticky"" mouse, which can't be the case, as I was quite careful to clean out the dust from inside the trackball socket on a regular basis. Both times it eventually got to the point where the device simply was not usable for ordinary Windows usage. The first time, I got a second one. The second time, I replaced it with my old mouse.I would very much like to have kept using this - I like the trackball a lot, it's much more natural, and less repetitive movement stress than with a mouse - but having the same type of hardware fail the same way twice in a row is no good.Going to see if I can find other trackballs from other manufacturers."
3,"great for carpal tunnel, bad for forefingers.","I researched these alot and gave it a try because of my carpal tunnel. I use the computer all day doing autocad work. My carpal tunnel quit bothering me completely, but i got aching in my metacarpal areas so I quit using it. The best thing I have found are ergorest arm supports. Google them. I never came across them when researching carpal tunnel on the internet, but I heard about them from a lady that works at my office. She also works as a physical therapist. I use it with a regular optical mouse. They are miracle workers for me and my carpal tunnel. Give them a try and see if they help you too. Let me know. I am wondering if it just helps me or if they help others too. Good Luck."
5,Great for special needs kids too,"Optical means dirt and grubby finger prints don't hang it up, and with the trackball it is much easier to manipulate than a mouseand won't move off target while pressing a button, which is a major frustration with a mouse. It can be used right or left handed.My daughter has been using one for years and we couldn't be happier."
2,Not a good & efficient product,I am an analyst and I only use Logitech trackballs. Decided to try this one. Almost impossible to scroll comfortably. I have very small hands and still find it awkward. To doubleclick you have to use one of the side buttons because there isn't a scrolling wheel. I am sure it would work fine for someone who is an occasional computer user. But if you are working long hours with Access and Excel don't even think about this mouse. Have gone back to my wireless Logitech 7-button mouse. Just wanted a trackball that was corded.
2,"Great mouse, poor to bad drivers","I've had this for mouse for almost two years. Love the fact that I could program the buttons for what I needed. During that time I've had it, I would have to reinstall the logic center software and drivers. sometimes I would get full function back most of the time I wouldn't. Logitech makes great products, but when it comes to support and available information they really SUCK!"
4,"nice trackball, great price","I've been a fan of mouseless computing for decades. I use a Kensington at work and MacAlly (not made anymore) at home. Smooth and accurate, I'd still like to see more flexible programming of the buttons. I mostly use 3 options, single click, double click, and right click, and I can't get all three on this unit. My gaming scores have gone up thanks to smooth response on the ball. Great for medium to small hands.Amazon's usual prompt and easy delivery was a big plus as well.Timedog"
2,The mouse becomes jumpy and totally freezes freqently,The frozen pointer requires lifting the ball and droping it to wake it up. It is totally inconvenient and waste time so I have now given away this product.
4,Cool but weird,"The big ball is a good bonus, but I don't think the design is optimal. The weird shape puts the right click button below resting position. Rolling with a forefinger and clicking with a thumb is counterintuitive. After three days into it and still haven't reached the speed that I could traverse with my 10 year old Marble trackman."
5,Excellent mouse for the money.,"I bought this mouse for my 4 year old son, so he can use an old laptop that had the touch pad. He gets frustrated using the traditional mouse because he runs out of room when moving it, but with this, that is not a problem anymore. He enjoys using it and is getting proficient in moving around the cursor to his desired selection."
4,A little awkward but.. as described,"This mouse functions well, however I find it rather awkward to handle, and the lack of a scroll wheel is something I didn't realize I would miss until I started using this. The programmable scrolling buttons work well, but feel ""wrong"" to my hand and makes it less functional (for me!)I originally purchased this for my laptop, as using the touchpad too much hurts my wrists.However, I much prefer my desktop mouse (see below) and will probably return this mouse and get another like my desktop!Trackman WheelHowever, this is still a quality mouse and it works great, it's just not right for my hand :)"
4,Marble Mouse Optical Trackball,"Great product, easy to use, easy to install. My left handed end users have told me that they find it much easier to use than the mice that we had been providing."
5,One of the best and cheapest trackballs,"This is an optical trackball with a one inch diameter red ball (the marble in ""marble mouse"") that moves within a three point holder with an optical pickup.Only the ball moves.There are four buttons. It is perfectly designed, very simple and effective.It is quite different than a moving mouse, and faster too.It takes a few minutes to get used to, but once you do, you may never want go back to a moving mouse again, mouse pad and allThis is just the thing to end repetitive motion pain and injury, especially if you turn up the mouse sensitivity or ""acceleration"".It is easy to clean, just pop out the red ball and wipe the holder.And believe it or not, I have seen expert gamers using it very effectively, and I swear they were faster than their competition.I use it for all my mundane computer work and no longer suffer from ""mouse hand"" pain.The price is right too, at between 14 and 20 dollars."
3,Hardware should come with software,"Yes that is right they lost 2 stars for not including their mac os driver in the package. Though it only took five minutes to find and download the driver from their site I want to send a message. great mouse/track ball, works well, buttons easily programed (once you have the software)."
1,Broke after 2 months - Mac OS X Tiger,"After the most recent Tiger security update (late December 2007), this trackball quit working for me. There are no Mac drivers apparently, so the problem can't be fixed. Logitech support does not actually support anything, according to the hoards of angry users there, so the prudent Mac user would buy from another vendor."
1,Began to fail after 24 hours,Day 1: Great.Day 2: why is the cursor drifting across the screen?Day 3: Why is the cursor JUMPING across the screen?Day 4: Motion of cursor is wildly unpredictable.Day 5: Returned to Amazon.
1,Logitech marble nouse----GARBAGE,"I have owned a Kensington Orbit mouse for the last five years, recently I purchased the logitech marble mouse to replace it. The trackball is raised much higher than the Kensington for no purpose and makes it very painful to use.I took back the logitech and bought a new Kensington Optical Trackball---YEE HAW, great product."
1,compatibility problems with Firefox,"Yeah it's a nice one and it looks good and all that but the scrolling down option is not available with Firefox AND THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INDICATED to potential buyers.As a result, and because there's no way I'm using Internet Explorer - you know what I mean, I don't use the mouse and stick to the pad. Bad Call logitech."
2,Disappointing,Compared to the Microsoft Trackball Explorer I was disappointed with this mouse. First of all the ball does not turn as freely so it takes more effort. It doesn't have a scolling wheel. And thirdly the buttons seem to be in an unnatural position when your hand is in position to use the ball.
2,Configuration is wierd,Just don't like the layout. Very hard to get used to the buttons since they're so small. Really got used to the microsoft trackball explorer and since they stopped making them I guess I'm stuck with this. It's about the closest I can find to it.
1,My hand is numb.,My work place recently bought these for our workstations. It has caused about 30% drop in speed of service. Most of this is due to anesthetize effect of long term use. The other problem that has occurred is lack of fine control. After dealing with these trackballs I have come to the conclusion that they must be designed for gamers that use it for two hours or less.
3,Worked for me,"Hi,And I actually purchased this as a replacement for one I lost. The folks I bought it for were happy, so...there you go:-)"
4,"Good, but gamers may have to be careful","This is a very high quality functional product from Logitech, with good ergonomics and configurable buttons. Most concerns about this product have been mentioned already but I would like to identify a few caveats:1. Gunk that gets on the trackball will accumulate in the ball ""socket,"" so clean it out every once in a while.2. You are using a completely different set of muscles and movements compared to a mouse. This may be good for some people and bad for others.3. The fundamental difference is that a mouse is primarily a wrist-controlled device, while is is a finger-controlled devices. Generally, the response and control with your wrist is greater, which MAY lead to problems for gamers. How you choose to adapt to one or the other is up to you, much like how some console gamers prefer joysticks versus control pads. Switching to a trackball will get you a huge drop in precision until you get used to it."
2,Missing a vital function,"I was dissapointed with this product. The main reason is that there is no scroll wheel which I use constantly throughout the day. Therefore I resold this mouse to a friend who did not mind the missing function. I also did not care for the shape of the mouse, it does not fit my hand nearly as well as my previous mouse... which is now discontinued. Sigh. Good luck finding a full function ergonomic mouse. The Logitech is not really adequate to my needs."
1,"No zoom, generic online help","When I see how many people have given this product a 5 star rating, it makes me wonder if every employee at Logitech was required by the company to submit a 5 star post for this product.I have surfed the Web for over an hour, and it does not appear that anyone can get the Logitech Marble Mouse to zoom in and out. You should know that the online help from Logitech is generic--so that it sort of covers all Logitech mice, including two and three button mice, as well as all types of trackballs. Therefore, you will find very little in the online help that is specific for the Marble Trackball.Someone on the Web has created a freeware download program that you install to make your Marble Trackball zoom in and out. If you already own a Marble Trackball, and need to zoom in and out, just keep looking on the Web until you find the download. Someone solved the problem that the SetPoint software from Logitech does not solve."
4,logitech optical mouse,"This is the 4th Logitech Optical ball mouse I have had in the past 10 or so years. I love them because they are so much easier to use than the standard mouse because the mouse remains stationary and the ball moves the cursor. The purchase price was reasonable and delivery was speedy. I am not quite satisfied because this mouse ball is not as smooth to operate as has been the case with ones I have had in the past. Over time they develop ""pits' that cause the ball to stick in one place."
4,My First trackball,I have decided to try trackball to give some relief to my wrist. I went with Logitech Marble Mouse mainly due to good ratings on amazon and its price and it was a good decision. I have been using this trackball for about 2 months.Overall I liked the mouse except for the scrolling. The scroll button or back button(which can be customized for different operations) are not that efficient or easy to use. I am using this mouse in my office and going to try something else for my home with better scrolling.
1,Sucks!,"This mouse has got to be one of the most awkward I have ever used: You have to get use to moving the trackball with your index and middle finger or some other combination with I may have been able to get used to if the was absolutely no other mice in existence, but the worse for me was no scroll."
2,blugggh!,"all i can tell you is i tried to save money by purchasing this mouse. my boyfriend lost partial mobility of his hand a week into using this THING.... and seriously he could not move his hand without it hurting. i found it very uncomfortable and difficult to master using myself... i say forget saving money and save your hands! spare the extra ten bucks and buy a better mouse. stick with logitech, they have awesome mice USUALLY- just don't buy this particular design. it is awkward!"
1,Disappointed,The mouse functions cannot be installed with windows xp. Tools or adjustments cannot be used or viewed.
1,This thing is HUGE!,"If your hand is very very big, like the size of a catcher's mitt, probably this thing will work for you as a computer mouse. Otherwise it's just another large blunt object, not even heavy enough to be a paperweight. And it's ugly. This thing is going straight back to Amazon. Yuk!"
5,A high quality ergonomic choice,"I bought this product because I needed something more ergonomic - I was having pain in my mouse hand. This mouse changed all that. I work with computers, and I insist on using one of these at work. It has the following benefits:1. Because it's a trackball, you don't have to move your wrist as much as you would with a mouse.2. The buttons are placed so that you can click with your thumb, which after all, is stronger (less likely to get injured) than your index finger.3. It's symmetrical, so you can switch back and forth from using it with your right hand or left hand - that gives your mouse hand a rest.I echo the comments of others that the optical trackball works great, and almost never needs cleaning. Also, I agree that it stays put nicely on the desk. Yes, this mouse was very different when I first started using it, but very very much worth getting used to it."
3,Good ball movement but lack of scrollwheel got to me,"The good:It is nice and easy to move around using the big ball placed in the middle. More comfortable than using a conventional mouse.The bad:No scrollwheel. This can be overcome, as other reviewers said, by using shortcut keys. But I couldn't get used to those. Also, the two small buttons on the sides are inconveniently placed.Conclusion: if you don't scroll a lot, this mouse may be a great buy for you. Otherwise, consider the other models with scrollwheels."
5,Great trackball,I bought one and liked it so much that I bought 2 more. The ball runs smooth and the software allows for a more personalized definition of the buttons.Highly recommend it!
5,Logitech Optical Mable Mouse,"This mouse is very comfortible to use. I don't have wrist pain anymore.Also, it can be used for both hands."
5,Very nice mouse alternative,"I bought this because my optical mouse would sometimes not track properly, no matter what pad I used. This trackball type mouse completely eliminates that problem. I did have a little trouble getting used to the fact that the scroll function (which was a wheel function on my last mouse) is now a button function...you must click the small button on the right to access universal scroll, and then click it again to get out of scroll mode. Kinda cumbersome, but I have a bad hand, and this mouse is extremely compfortable for me. I also like the back feature for surfing. The software loaded easy, and requires a restart for the mouse to be fully functional."
4,pretty cool,"I bought this after I stepped on my earlier conventional mouse (don't ask why!). Now I don't think I can go back to mice as the world knows them. This is a very helpful product and is more comfortable, more accurate and requires lesser care than mice we are used to (though I would not recommend trampling it either). Easy on the wrist, because there is virtually no wrist movement. Scrolling function works pretty well for me using the combination of keys. Only thing is that it scrolls in jerks rather than smoothly. For this I blame the bundled software and my system-resource poor computer. Because of this, the software has stopped working on some occassions, especially the scroll function. This is the only reason for me not giving it 5 stars. Remember, it will spoil your mousing habits!"
5,I own two and would never go back to a regular mouse!,These are one of the best inventions since the Internet!They have looks and intelligence. With the trackerball being moved by my fingertips I get less wrist and hand fatigue from longterm use of the mouse. I use one at work too and it does cause curious stares and questions but once you use one and give it a fair try you will be impressed with the agility. It is easy to clean and doesn't get gunked up like a regular mouse does. The price is definitely right too!
5,Logitech Mouse - Love it,I love this type of mouse. It's great to not have to move it all over the place.
1,Not suited for Macs,"Logitech Optical Marble Mouse (USB/PS2)This product is NOT compatible with Mac computers, Logitech's claim to the contrary. It cannot be programmed to simulate the Apple mouse's scrolling feature. Hence one star, BUT:Using it with a Windows-based PC it deserves 5 stars. I have been using the older ball plus two-button mouse for 5 years and was very disappointed that I cannot use the newer four-button one with my new iMac OS 10.5. A new driver called LCC 2.6 does not repair that defect, nor will Logitech reply to comments or complaints in this regard."
3,Trackball,I have just changed from this item to a trackball wheel as I have found the scrolling wheel to be very useful.Despite that the trackball gave many years of service and is still in very good condition it is now relegated to a lesser computer.
1,Horrible ergonimic design,I bought this mouse thinking it would eliminate the finger pain I suffer in my left click finger. Although the trackball allows you to avoid using your left click finger it causes pain and stiffness in the rest of the fingers because of the poor ergonomic design. I find my self tensing most of my fingers to hold them off the right click button to avoid accidentally right clicking which happens quite often. This is because of its ambidextrous design. This was a waste of money. It may be good for a casual user of mice but not for someone who uses a mouse 8 hours a day as their profession. I've gone back to using my Evoluent mouse which isn't perfect either but causes me much less pain. Do not buy this mouse if your RSI problem is in your fingers. I am now looking for a foot pedal mouse instead.
2,Make sure you want a trackball mouse!,"While the product works well as a a trackball mouse, I found it lacking in precision compared to a traditional optical mouse. If you like trackable mice, this is nice product to get. Just be sure that you want a trackball mouse."
4,Reliable. Too small. Lacks scrolling.,"Too small for big palms. Lack scrolling mechanism. It's about time someone made trackball that's really ergonomic, on that allows the palm to rest on its side!"
2,There are better trackballs from Logitech,"The setpoint software from Logitech seems to crash when you use this particular product for scrolling. I have several mice and trackballs from logitech and all function perfectly with the same setpoint software. Only this mouse gives problems and crashes setpoint. It happens consistendly on both my PCs.The ball is large and comfortable to use. Buttons are large. But in this time and age, you need a dedicated scrolling wheel somewhere on a mouse or trackball.Having to press both buttons to activate scrolling is definitely tedious.Try the wireless trackman instead or if you prefer using your fingers rather than the thumb for moving the ball.....the optical trackman."
1,OS X Users BEWARE,"I used this trackball for 10+ years with various PCs and was happy to find it claimed to be compatible with MACs. Initially it worked, but stopped. Took it to Genius Bar and found out it had basically burned out my logic board. Very expensive repair when not under warranty. For the record, I have 13"" MBP running OS X Lion. Also worth noting that it no longer works on my Sony Vaio either. Buh bye Marble Mouse. It was a great 10 years."
2,not pleased,Track ball stops working frequently. I've cleaned the ball and the contacts. Did not help. The shape is not ergonomically well-designed.
3,Sticky ball is aggrivating: design flaw,"I really like this mouse than any other I've used. I write and do internet research all day long, and this has eliminated wrist pain caused by a traditional mouse. I have been using it for two years.However...From the get go, the trackball rolls a bit rough and has consistent stiction that is really irritating. I have tried cleaning, replacing with a new one, to no avail. Now looking for one that rolls more smoothly."
1,TEAM FANATICS STINKS,I JUST BOUUGHT THE 1989 AND 1991 TOPPS COMPLETE SET FROM TEAM FANATICS. THEY SHOW THE ITEM IN A PRETTY BOX (CARD COLLECTORS KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT)AND THEY SHIPPED ME THE COMPLETE SET IN A WHITE BOX WITH A PIECE OF TAPE OVER IT. I TRIED CALLING TEAM FANATICS AND ALL YOU GET IS PLEASE EMAIL US YOUR PROBLEM. I HAVE AND FOR TWO WEEKS NO RESPONSE FROM THEM. I'M VERY DISAPOINTED IN THEM AND WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. I'M STILL TYRYING TO GET A HOLD OF THEM BUT IM NOT HOLDING MY BREATH AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO BUYS FROM THEM GOOD LUCK
2,For the beginner,"When I ordered the video I was hoping that I would see different solutions/techniques while they were applied.This video is great for a beginner. For someone that has little experience with finishing, the video allows them to see finishes being applied. Someone beyond the basics will be disappointed.The author shows you how to apply oil, water and alcohol finishes but spends very little if any time discussing the problems encountered with different stains/dyes. In addition, the video quality is poor which prevents you from seeing any detail.If you have ever applied a stain, or dye to a project and was not satisfied with the appearance (color or surface quality) you need to look elsewhere for solutions. A couple of good finishing books are ""Understanding Wood Finishing"" by Bob Flexner and ""Great Wood Finishes"" by Jeff Jewitt."
5,I play this CD every day!,"I play this CD every day in my car. I know where each song comes in on my route to work. I know the words to each song and have no desire to skip over any of them, although I tend to want to replay certain songs over and over. I was fortunate enough to see Jim perform live in his current one-man show, and I became an instant fan. He is a quadruple threat: music, lyrics, guitar playing, singing - all are incredible! I agree with the reviewer: OVERNIGHT is one of the best songs I have ever heard!"
5,"ONE VOICE, ONE GUITAR, ONE GREAT CD!","I WAS FLOORED WHEN I PUT JIM FEMINO'S ""ONE VOICE, ONE GUITAR"" CD INTO MY DISCMAN! IT'S ONE GREAT CD WITH AMAZING SONGS! EACH SONG IS SO WELL CRAFTED AND PERFORMED, YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE BUT JIM'S VOICE AND HIS GUITAR! THIS CD IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF WHAT A GREAT SONGWRITER IS AND SHOULD BE. JIM PAINTS SUCH GREAT PICTURES WITH HIS LYRICS, THAT AFTER HEARING ""FRED"" (ABOUT A 3 LEGGED BALDING DOG) I WISHED FRED WAS MY DOG! ""I NEVER DREAMED SHE DREAMED"" AND ""ME NOT LOVING YOU"" ARE MY TWO FAVORITES! THEY ARE HITS! NO DOUBT TOBY KEITH AND SOME OF THE OTHER BIG STARS OF NASHVILLE WILL BE COMING TO JIM FEMINO ONCE AGAIN FOR HITS! ALL JIM NEEDS TO DO IS GIVE THEM THIS CD AND LET THEM HAVE THEIR PICK!"
4,The captivating Michelle WIlliams,"Michelle Williams continues to prove that she is one of the best actresses today in TAKE THIS WALTZ, but that's not the only reason to see this film. A true-telling tale of adultery and a married couple who is trying to pick up the pieces in their fractured relaionship makes TAKE THIS WALTZ one of the sleeper movies of the year. A little long near the end, but it's definitely worth watching! Interesting role for Seth Rogen too, but I liked it!"
3,It's pretty good until its not,Usually the films that HDNet Movies pick to sneak preview on its channel the Wednesday before it opens in (limited) theatrical release is of dubious entertainment value at best and complete trash at worst. That's why this soul-searching Indy came as such an unexpected surprise.Margot is married in what see she's as a loving but boring marriage to Lou (Seth Rogen) turning in a brilliant understated performance that is better than the more-well known performances he's usually known for by a mile) Shr soon becomes smitten with a more adventurous guy and most of the film is her inner turmoil about that. Good performances by all and I was drawn into the story up until it promptly went off the rails towards the ending (don't worry no spoilers)
3,Complementary colors,"I'm pretty sure this movie is supposed to be about marriage, relationships, infidelity, and ennui, but it turns out to be about turquoise and orange."
4,Superior acting,I was very impressed with the quality of the acting and with the script. I expected a romantic comedy with the standard format and this movie avoided that. The photography was excellent.
1,YUCK!!!!,just when you think it can't get worse it does....WTF where and the hell did those sex scenes towards the end come from ....I can't believe I watched the whole thing.
2,Take This Waltz,I purchased this video given the character names involved in the production. Not my best choice the movie was painfully long and equally boring.
2,It felt like I was going to the Dentist,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Take This Waltz"" (A Drama DVD review)...It was ok.Genre: 6.5 Movie: 4Keep an eye on ""The Lowedown"" on FacebookWhat's it about?A happily married woman falls for the artist who lives across the street. Margot is no longer sure if she's happy in her marriage or if she'd be happier with her fantasies with Daniel.What did I think?It felt like I was going to the dentist...I watched it because it felt like I had to. The acting was good, but the story was so saddening that the funny parts weren't all that funny. It was supposed to be sexually graphic, but there was really only one part that was. If you like a really depressing love story, then this movie is for you."
1,Hated this movie.,This movie glamorized infidelity. I strongly recommend anyone who is married not to see this movie or you'll be appalled as I was at how blase they were regards cheating.
1,Top 5 worst movies I have ever paid to see!,"Simply just bad. No direction, bad acting. I will never get those two hours back. Seth's acting is getting worse. The actors looked uncomfortable with each other."
1,Highly prententious without delivering,"I was determined to make it to the end but I should not have been wanting the film to just be done. The writer seems to have forgotten where the plot was supposed to go. Scenes and actions and the choices that the characters make should be derived from the story's thesis---what was the writer's argument about life? The writer knew the answers at the beginning and then forgot.I was bored throughout. I got tired of staring at the main character's depressed and confused facial expressions.The main character had no direction in her life but plenty of commitment to self-centeredness. Worst of all, I did not respect her. Life just came along and pushed her into choices instead of her being a deliberate actor on her own behalf. Who was she? Where was her determination and sense of purpose? And, finally, as far as the plot conclusion goes, where were the inevitable consequences for her lack of self-determination and purpose?"
1,Nonsensical,"This film is annoying. I generally think Michelle Williams makes good choices, but I can't understand what she saw in this material. I didn't care for any of the characters, and the story is inane."
3,Pretty good,Seemed a little slow at times but good overall. I don't know that I'd watch it again but it kept my attention.
1,Very boring,Boo! It was very boring. We stopped watching it half way through. We felt like we wasted our money and time.
1,One of the WORST ever!,"If I could give the movie a (-) Star I would. Gloomy, too much nudity and explicit sex. Acting is terrible, too. Don't waste your time or money :("
1,Awful movie,Soooooo sloooooooooww. Not as cerebral as the director thinks it is. Very boring and lacks interesting dialogue and interaction. I do not recommend
1,Annoying Movie,The characters are all really annoying and the whole movie is slow and painful to watch! Don't waste your time or money.
1,Weird as hell!,"I just finished watching this movie and Im happy Im not the only one who didnt like this movie. I love Seth Rogan, but I swear I didn't understand what was going on between Seth's character and Margo. Margo was emotionally up and down. And then the end..like what really happened..there was a lot of things left unsaid and I guess I had to be a really intellectual person to understand.BTW: The naked women shower scene was not needed. Yikes! :/"
3,Very Strange Movie...,Chose this as a date night movie for my husband and I and we both just looked at each other after it was over and said what the...it was way too slow for our taste with not much of a plot and a very strange ending. I did enjoy some parts of the movies and acting but as a whole this movie did not do anything for us at all. I have seen much better movies that convey the message.
2,Skip this Waltz,"From pretty much the start of this movie I wanted to turn it off. Not long after my husband said this is really lame. The dialogue was so completely unrealistic and forced and the main character was annoying. The interactions between both the husband and wife and the wife and the new guy were so unnatural and not what would really happen. The public pool shower scene put the nail in the coffin for us and we shut it off there. You are just watching and bam you are blasted with a bunch of full frontal beaver shots and not just for a second, but extended. It has no place at all in a movie like this and it pretty much represents the poor, juvenile quality of the rest of the movie."
1,Poison Propaganda,"that marriage should be abandoned the second it feels ""incomplete"" for new lovers (who will surely feel ""incomplete"".) Maybe this writer director was raped during childhood, slept with lots of losers, then everyone who could possibly advance her career, and is now a man hating lesbian with fantasies of retribution. It's the most cynical movie I have ever seen bar none."
1,Zzzzzzz . . . .,"Huh? What? Review? Oh, I'm sorry, this movie put me to sleep. There are some more prurient reasons as to why a man might watch this movie. A Google search can satisfy you on that end. As for the movie itself, it did not hold my interest, and I'm someone who can watch movies like this if the story is interesting, but it was not."
1,Horrible,I like independent movies but this one was just horrible. Had to turn it off half way through. Characters had potential but were way too flat.
2,Awkward,"The only reason I didn't give this movie one star was because the acting WAS good. Acting isn't the problem. I just felt uncomfortably awkward watching most of the interaction in this movie. My fiance and I watch our fair share of movies good and bad. When we are listening to dialogue and are like ""what?!"", the movie isn't that great. At one point, we decided that watching other couple's inside jokes and silly, weird conversations just isn't as much fun as having our own together. I generally don't mind nudity in movies when it has a purpose, but the women's locker room scene was unneeded to me. It served no purpose to the plot of the movie but to only be ""daring"" and ""artsy"". I definitely won't be recommending this to anybody as much as I wanted to like it because I really like the cast."
5,The cream that rises to the top,There are so many bad movies out there . So many that I almost get disappointed in watching movies anymore . But then I see a movie like this . That draws you in . That's real. And gritty. And it takes you to another place in someone else world for just a little while . I was pleasantly surprised with this movie . The acting was perfect . The story real and sad and sweet. Michelle Williams is one of this generations best actors !
2,Weird Indie Film,"I enjoyed Seth Rogen in this film primarily because he seemed mostly normal. I can't say the same thing for Michelle Williams' character. Overall, this film was pretty weird but kept my interest throughout it's long running time. There was a weird nude shower scene with obese older ladies and a lot of the dialogue almost seemed improvised on the spot rather than off a script. Michelle Williams even made random weird facial contortions in one scene. I can't say I'd recommend this film unless you're a fan of either Rogen or Williams. Because of the nudity displayed by Williams, I'm thinking her acting career is in shambles since the Dawson's Creek days..."
3,Loved Micelle Williams and Sarah Silverman,"The technical quality was splendid. The story line was not. It was very slow for the most part, very moody, and in the end seemed pointless. The very, very best thing about this movie was the full frontal, totally nude scene of Michelle and Sarah in the shower after their water aerobics session. That was the only FFN for Sarah, but there were quite a few by Michelle, who has to be the most daring top movie star. Michelle, whether clothed or not, is gorgeous. Beautiful face, figure and legs. Did she arouse me? Absolutely, but as comedian Redd Fox once said, ""When I stop being a dirty old man, I will be a dead old man."" Michelle is simply drop dead beautiful and very talented. Why the Seth Rogin character, who played her husband, was more interested in different ways to cook chicken than making out with Michelle, is beyond belief. I gave it a 3 out of 5 score, because as a movie, it deserved a 1, but as a loving look at Michelle, it deserves at 100 out of 5."
1,I Would Rather Be Mauled By Rabid Sloths,"The acting was forced, the characters were bizarre, and the soundtrack is filled with harmonicas. If you enjoy the feeling of watching mentally unstable people interact, you'll love this movie."
4,Decent movie.,I'm not sure why this movie got so many bad ratings. I think the plot was somewhat original and believable. Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen were both wonderful. Definitely worth the free viewing.
2,Made me sad,"This movie has been haunting me since I watched it yesterday. I hate the decision Margo made, and I really hated the end - pretty much everything after she made the decision, including the gratuitous weird sex part which, in and of itself, would have been fine I suppose, but I was still stunned by the aforementioned stunningly bad decision and it was too jarring and bizarre after that blow. The last time Margo talked to the Seth Rogen character made me cry, not because I was moved by the relationship or their connection, but because her decision was just so damned awful and it made me sad. I usually love movies like this, and I will say that it was visually beautiful and well-acted and a great vehicle for Michelle Williams. But I really wish Margo had listened to the Sarah Silverman character."
2,Pointless,"Kept waiting for a plot to unfold. The movie crawled along until the sex scenes started, if you want to sell your acting on sex the move to another genre."
4,good movie,"seemed slow at times, but rather enjoyed seth rogan in a different that usual role for him. storyline was a bit different...not your standard cookie cutter hollywood film, which is refreshing."
2,Slowwwww!,"Very slow and a little depressing, definitely not a must see. If you are looking for comedy look elsewhere. If you have a an hour and a half you need to kill then give it a watch."
2,I just didn't quite 'get it'.,"I was hoping it would all make sense by the end, but it didn't. In fact, it ended quite abruptly."
3,Too slow,I kept waiting for something to happen and when it finally did the result did not match the personality or character traits of the two people who were falling in love.
3,I was really disappointed.,"I really wanted to like this movie. I love the premise and the actors involved. I love that big names take the time to work with small indies. Something was just missing, or off. It's nice for a lazy Sunday - but I feel like renting it VOD for $5 was a waste of my money. I'm so sad to say that."
2,Some really good acting squandered on this,"Odd, you know Seth Rogen's character is the only one that isn't two-dimensional. I would have given it one star were it not that the film does illustrate a good point, underscored by one of the supporting characters lines: ""New things get old"". If your happiness depends upon others, you are most likely headed for a long road of disappointments and despair.One other note I'd make is this film has a strange feeling toward the end that despite being overly long, a lot of important stuff has been edited out. You may walk away feeling like did - as if I had just drunkenly run over someone's trash cans, wondering where the hell did they come from, and what am I doing out here anyway?"
2,Take This Waltz...and Shove it?,"Michele Williams turns in a nuanced performance, however, Seth Rogen love him or hate him is always Seth Rogen. I think this film misses the mark due to the lack of a credible agonist / antagonist which undermines the cadence and credibility of this film. She is in actuality torn be between two drones yet we are to believe sparks are flying? The trouble is no chemistry. It may be that the scripted characters were 2-D cut outs or possibly the actors brought no heft to their roles( I suspect a little of both) The female lead is reacting to dead space as though she were a mime and in the end you are left feeling that for all of her struggle there simply was nothing to be gained. It feels quirky, yet ultimately incongruent and unsatisfying....and lonnng. In the dead of space no one can hear your angst."
1,Boring,Don't waste your money. This story is everywhere and makes absolutely no sense. The only interesting person is Seth Rogan and even he doesn't look like he committed to this movie.
1,poor,"good cast, horrible film. no point, no plot, no closure. it's like watching a home video of people you don't know."
4,a nice little reflection on life,this movie's under appreciated. i enjoyed the movie with great actings. sarah polley did a good job in telling a simple story with a clear message. a bit of emotions but it allows one to sit down and think a bit on life decisions.
3,Not the worst pick for a Saturday night in...,Definitely not a memorable movie but it wasn't awful. It had a decent premise and kept my interest but I highly doubt I will ever watch it again.
2,I expected a comedy,"With Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman, I automatically assumed I'd be watching a good comedy. Instead I found a dreary, drama-ish, tale of searching for greener pastures instead of making the most of what you have. It felt awkward."
3,Worth watching,"Beautiful, visually. Strange, deep look at a young woman's sense of self and relationships. Left me feeling thoughtful and a bit sad."
2,not what I expected,"This book is a collection of questions and responses or articles originally written in a magazine. While I'm sure it has value, it was not what I expected. The pieces were too scattered in topic to do me any good. I get this kind of information from mamasource.com, a site for Mothers to ask questions & respond to other mothers. The other review of this book were glowing, which prompted me to buy it, but somehow I missed the kind of format it was. I returned it."
3,I liked Tourist better,"I bought this CD thinking I would like it as much as I liked St Germain's ""Tourist"", but I definitely like ""Tourist"" better."
2,Not very creative.,"This album was a bit disappointing. I listen to a lot of jazz, blues and electronica but I call this Musak (aural wallpaper). Spend your money instead on Glide by New York Eletric Piano or the new Metheny Mehldau album."
2,Dull,"There are three good songs on this album: Deep In It, Street Scene, and Forget It. The rest of the tracks are filler. Alabama Blues is a good disco song, but it doesn't fit in with the rest of the slow-cool-jazz-groove thing on the rest of the disc.Buy TOURIST instead."
2,a very cool CD for very uncool people.,"Everytime music comes up as a subject in my dull conversations with pathetically blind people they always have to say that they like electronic music and jazz (actually they always say that they like all music generes, and eveyone knows everything is nothing) and when i ask who? they will always reply (in 98% of the cases) Ella Fitzgerald and St. Germain.Now Ella I happen to like (in addition to many other jazz vocalists) but St. Germain's CD Boulevard is Just....Well.....PLAIN BOOoooORING.My advice to those palin misguided geeks zombified by the media who enjoy the most predictible execution of this ""relaxing blend"" of cool jazz and house as a work of art to mention every time the words jazz and electeronica come to mind is GET INTERESTED!I PITTY YOU! MY LIFE WOULD SUCK WITHOUT MUSIC!There are many great jazz artists out there! and a long list of electronic artists that make Air and St Germain sound like a commercial for hair conditioner."
4,"Not better then legos, but still fun.","I guess we'd need more in a box to build anything really amazing, but I love the idea that they swivel in their links."
5,Educational Toy,"This is my second time ordering ZOOB, first for my grandson, now for my granddaughter. It is a creative and educational toy for boys and girls alike. Recommended!"
3,pinched fingers,"I can't believe no one mentioned about getting theirs or their childs fingers pinched with these things? At a friends house, my children and I ( my children are age 4 ), were playing with these, and every time any of us tried to connect a piece to another piece, our fingers would get pinched...it hurt!!! No one else had that problem?"
4,Kept granchildren busy,"During a holiday at my home I have 5 grandchildren to keep busy before and after the meal. My daughter told me that the nursery school which my grandson attends has this great toy, Zoob. I ordered it through Amazon as I usually do and it did the trick."
4,Fun for different ages,"I gave this Zoob set to my 6 and 4 year olds for Christmas. They both enjoy the toy and can use it effectively. The 6 year old immediately started using the pieces to make ""people"" in a very imaginative way. The 4 year old just loved clicking the pieces together in long lines. Even our 1-1/2 year old enjoys the colorful pieces and I do not see any swallow danger."
2,Mediocre film about the mentally insane.,"This film stars the ever glamourous wooden actress Lucia Mendez. The story is about a reporter who is investigating conditions in a asylum and later learns that she is a patient there, the film is full of the expected twists but with none of the suspense, it's hard to tell the villains from the hero in this mediocre potboiler, the biggest problem is the script which is badly written and also Lucia Mendez who will not allow herself to look like a patient, she always looks like she has her own makeup artist and hair person in the asylum unlike everyone else, she has more makeup on than all the nurses put together making the film look particularly idiotic, unless you are a fan of Lucia Mendez who is in every scene, attempting to act, stay away from this routine film effort."
5,5STARS,I AM A FAN OF LUCIA MENDEZ I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING AND NOW IVE FOUND HER I WOULD LIKE HER BIOGRAPHY AND ANYTHING I COULD NOW ABOUT HER
3,nice,"I bought this cd because it was the only one available, or so listed on Amazon and I had to have some music by these two,after seeing some of their performances on you tube.The music and singing are ok and likable, I only wish that there were some better songs on this cd.The price is ok for what you get though."
5,huge on hard drive and small on price.,The reason that I bought this was so that I could add to my video collection and with this I am now able to make a huge collection and not have my computer and small external hard drive bogged down with all of my movies. For the purpose of storeing mass quantities of data this is a great buy since it is so cheep. I would say that if you don't have much data to store and need it to be trully mobile I would go with a smaller modle but for 500GB this is as small as they get at least for this generation of technology so I feel it is a great buy and I would recomend this to people who need this kind of thing.
5,an excellent hard drive at a cheap price,"this product is an outstanding one, it held up all my movies, music, and pictures. it also backs my files up incase my laptop craches, in that case I have no fear cause I can just plug it to another computer and voulla, my files are still there"
1,The Worst hard drive ever,"It is really a nightmare , I've stored about 90 gb on it and then suddenly it stopped working and I can NEVER access my files again , I plugged the power and I got the stupid blue lights but it never show on my PC. any idea where the mistake is ????"
1,Unreliable,"Don't buy yourself a headache. This drive worked for me for a couple of months. One day, however, when I plugged it in, my computer wouldn't recognize it anymore. Instead, it asked me to install the device drivers -- which a USB HD shouldn't require. I checked with SimpleTech. There are no drivers (except for Win98), because they're not needed.Several hours of research later, I've learned that this is a VERY common problem with these drives. Try a Google search for ""Simpletech not recognized,"" and you'll find page after page of people who've had the same problem I have. Only a tiny few seem to have ever solved the problem -- and so far, I'm not one of them.This drive makes a moderately attractive paperweight, but I can't recommend buying it to store data."
1,Break down,i ordered this hard drive to iraq were im staioned. when is first plugged it in it didn't seem to have any problems because i already have the 250GB version. when i first started to load my music and videos it seamed like it was taking forever to load. after it was done it would take a few minites to load up when i plugged it into my comp. after about 2 weeks it just stopped working at all. being in iraq i wasn't able to mail it back within the 30 day warinty time so im suck here with a broken hard drive. but at least it makes for a good paper wieght. i don't recamend any buy this. considering how many other reviews say the same thing about it breaking down.
1,DO NOT USE THIS DRIVE if you value your data!,"I got this drive to backup a laptop that had gone kaput... I put all my info on this thing, then restored the laptop. I intended to back up my important stuff from this drive to another soon.. But never got the chance. WITHIN ONE WEEK of purchasing and using this drive, I started getting a clicking noise and the drive was not recognized by the computer.I called SimpleTech and was told that the clicking noise indicated a hard drive failure; they could replace/repair the drive, but my data was gone unless I wanted to pay someone hundreds of dollars to recover it.This thing is completely unreliable and the customer service agent was absolutely unempathic, unhelpful, and rude.BUY SOMETHING ELSE!! I'm going for a Seagate this time."
1,Out of Date... a Relic,"This was a good investment 5 years ago. But now it is out of date .. a relic... they have smaller wallet size exterior hard drive with 4 terabytes of space, that do not need and outlet for power just a USB port... This is Not a good buy."
1,DOA--what more can I say?,"$265 for something that's dead out of the box? Decidedly not cool. Admittedly, it only took three emails to SimpleTech's tech support to get an RMA. Now I can look forward to the adventure of getting it replaced in some reasonable time frame.Given the other 18 (so far) one star reviews, I should have spent my money on another manufacturer's offering."
5,Great inexpensive for storage hard Drive SimpleTech 500 GB,"Very good product. Working great. Recomended to buy. In-expensive for 500 GB. Easy to operate, just plug and use it. Has a software to create DVD or CD. If you buy, you will love it."
1,"Beware fine print, gotacha!!","Item came without power AC adapter, haven't been able to use. Wrote seller asking for adapter. Seller wrote back that I should have read fine print, that it did not have an adapter. Seller also suggested I go to electronics store and buy AC adapter for a few bucks. I have not been able to find an adapter to fit and they do not cost a few bucks but $20 to $70. Tried to contact SimpleTech, they do not answer E-mails or telephone. My suggestion is to do what I have always done and buy from a reputable dealer and to buy complete in original box with stated return policy and guarantee. My first purchase on Amazon.com and my last."
1,This is not the HD for you,"Dear Users,I have had this drive for over a year now and it worked fine (notice the word, 'worked'). Now last week I noticed that it was not coming on and allowing me to access my precious data I had so laboriously put on.I have tried just about everything except the electric shock treatment which I believe is not for HDs.ProsIt has a nice color and space.ConsIt will leave you crying after not allowing to access your data no matter what you do.Ps After checking the site for drivers I really realized how much I need to apply the electric shock treatment because the site is useless."
3,simpletech 500gb hard drive,"this is the 2nd one that I own the first one 250gb died after one yr of use.I do like the size being so small,compact in size. Hopefully this one will last longer."
3,Be Prepared To Intercept This Embedded Trojan Horse: TR/Agent.59904.B,"This was a Boxing Week discounted item. It was the cheapest 1.0 TB external hard drive in the store (I wonder why?). Since I own the 250GB SimpleTech SimpleDrive external HDD and didn't have any problems with it (even after it was accidentally dropped 4 feet onto a concrete floor), I presumed the 1.0TB would be just as smooth if not better.Immediately upon connection and activation of the unit, my notebook's Start Avira Antivir Personal Version 8 software discovered a trojan horse (TR/Agent.59904.B) which was embedded in the unit. Not a good start. So, that trojan horse had to be deleted.I prefer using the faster StorageSync software which came with the 250GB SimpleTech to backup files.Aside from the Trojan Horse surprise, the unit works as designed."
1,I lost everything,"I put all of my movies,music and pictures onto this hard drive so that I could transfer everything from my old computer to my new laptop. When I plugged the hard drive in, it started making loud noises and my computer wouldn't recognize it. The hard drive failed beyond anything the computer techs could recover, and I lost everything. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Flashing Red Light Problem - Keep always two backups,"Seems a good product. But I noticed some people they had the same problem that I had last week.I had the 500gb. Suddenly I got flashing red light problem and everything stopped working. I opened the box and I completely disconned the hard drive from the box. Then I connected the HD using ""USB 2.0 Drive Mate"" kit to my laptop and fortunately my laptop recognized the drive as a usb drive and everything worked fine. Quickly I backuped my data in another drive.Seems my problem was about the smal board in simpletech box which connect the HD to the usb port."
2,Bad luck?,"I bought 2 of these because the cost would be cheaper than buying 1 TB drive, 1 stopped working after 1 day and the other one is having problems (unable to be used.) not satisfied at all :("
4,"NOT truly portable, req AC power","We bought this drive after owning two of the 120GB drives and being very happy with them. The 120s are powered off of the USB, so can be used anywhere. We noted that the 500GB drive listed did not specify portable, and clearly required AC power, while the 120 and 320 specified portable. Without looking any further, we purchased two 320s. They work well enough, but are not truly portable for us, as they cannot be used without AC power. Just be aware that portable seems to be referring to physical size (??), not power source. Our next drive will be the 250GB, which is USB powered."
1,Don't drop while in use,"The drive is actually good but the shock resistance is really bad. The drive fell of a corner table while in use (~1.5 ft) onto a carpeted floor and then stopped working...after doing some online research I see this is a common failure with this drive.I have other USB drives that have fallen while in use and still work but this one just stopped working - gives a clicking sound and is not recognized by the computer.If you want a back up drive that is mainly used only for backup, then I would recommend this drive, else find a better alternative with good shock resistance."
1,Bad Customer Service - No returns,"My SimpleTech SimpleDrive 500MB USB drive broke after 8 months of use. I filled out the RMA request form online and submitted it. I faxed my original receipt to the service department adn waited for a RMA email. Then nothing. No response. I emailed, faxed and waited endlessly on the phone to their customer no service which never picked up. They never responded to my warrantee return request. Don't buy this brand. It is SimpleBad."
1,This drive caused he USB port on my computer to fail,"I purchased the 500GB External Hard Drive. I plugged in the usb cable and the power cord, the computer recognized a ""new hardware found"". Then my usb mouse stopped working, I could not find the drive on ""my computer"", this hard drive fried my USB ports. I now have to purchase a USB card for my computer as the built in ones are no longer working. Taking this drive back to the store."
1,Simpletech - Simply the worst,"I have had 2 diffirent products by this company ,the SP-U35/320 320 and a cool mint minidrive both broke down in no time flat for no reason at all. these thing are suppose to backup files not lose them"
1,Failed near instantly,"I had to return this almost as soon as it arrived as the drive stopped working within the first plug in to the USB port. When I contacted the seller, they mentioned this specific model was having that issue frequently. Will not order a SimpleDrive again."
2,not portable,"I Bought it by mistake, also it bring a external AC Input cable, not recommended as a portable device. Also I had this hard drive only for 3 month because in my house we had a electrical issue, so the disk was shocked trough the AC Input cable. From that moment I decided never to buy a Hard drive with AC Input cable."
2,Sad In Georgia.,"I purchased a SimpleTech external drive in 2009. I only use it to store pictures, some music, and few movies. I only used about 48 GB of the 500GB storage space. I usually just leave it on my desk and use it as backup. The drive doesn't get moved around much. I have dropped it once on a carpeted floor from my desk (2ft maybe). The last time I turned it on to store some pictures, it turned on, the blue light came on, made a few clicking noises and went silent. Tried restarting many times. Nothing. I'm not sure what to do next to retrieve my data. I mean what do you do when your backup fails?"
1,Mine broke less than 2 days from purchase!,"I bought the hard drive because it was on sale. I backed up my home movies the first night and then the second night hooked it up to back up some more files. The USB port on the machine snapped off completely dislocating it from the machine. I didn't even have it for 2 days! I contacted the company who wrote back ""We are baffled by this occurance....Please bring it back to the store you bought it from to retrieve the files."" Wow! What great customer support! Go back and pay a store to retrieve my files! Great work Simpletech! Now I had to pay a store TWICE what I payed for the machine just to get my files back! DO NOT BUY!!! A PIECE OF JUNK! I would give zero stars if it would let me."
1,JUNK,"Had to replace the first one after six months - couldn't get my money back, after being assured by the tech department that they hardly ever replaced these or ""they wouldn't still be in business."" From the look of reviews, they won't be for long. My replacement lasted two years and died today with no warning. SimpleTech - more like SimpleSuck."
1,Short life expectancy,"I bought this just a little over a year ago. Installation is simple, use is very simple, but 14 months into it, only being used 4 times and it doesn't operate anymore. All my data is trapped inside this hard drive I can no longer access. Comments online have said similar things. I wish I would have seen that sooner. A device that is stored safely in a cupboard and used 4 times in 14 months shouldn't just stop working. Avoid."
1,Pretty bad.,"Like others I bought this, the 320 gb version, and it worked fine at first but then it started getting finicky and after having it for maybe a few months it stopped altogether. Every once in a while after I mess with it for a long time I can get it to work, but not often. I'm now hoping to get it to work long enough to transfer my files to my new western digital hard drive. This one should work better."
1,Not working out for me.,I've had this drive for almost two years. My sister had hers for less than a year when hers died completely. Mine just died out of the blue today. Now I'm crossing my fingers that the 6 years of data I had backed up on this drive is recoverable. I would not recommended this drive for anyone who actually wants to keep their data.
1,Died after 3 months,"The drive performed very well for first 3 month. When I had about 150GB worth of data, it suddently died. I dont know if it is the adapter that failed or the drive but it wouldn't powerup anymore.This basically means that all your backups are gone and you have no way to recover that.Overall performance of this drive is poor."
1,It workes very well for a few months and then died!!,I used the drive to backup all of my important files and family photos and videos. The drive worked very well for a few months and then all of a sudden decided to stop working.I only powered it on when I needed to do backups and restores so it is not like it could have overheated. I am not sure what happened.
1,Unable to format drive. Poor quality.,"I've had this drive for several months, and it seemed to work fine. Then, I was unable to retrieve some family photos from it. System would lock up on read errors. So I offloaded all I could and tried a format of the drive. Failed 7 times. No diagnostic software provided by manufacturer. It's as if they are relying on other drive manufacturers to provide it. Only a basic user guide is provided on their 'support' CD. Poor support.After downloading and running Seagate's Seatools, the long generic test FAILED. Why couldn't Simpletech have such a BASIC tool.I would NOT recommend buying this drive under ANY circumstance. Poor initial quality if it won't even format. I do not even want to send it back for fear they'd send me another. Dependability is of the utmost on USB hard drives. Simlpletech is not reliable for me."
1,Massive Disappointment,"I ordered the 320 gb drive and received a defective piece of hardware.I asked for a replacement and received a second one that did not workeither ... I called the manufacturer ... no one answered their phones.I called twice and both times waited 20 minutes. Finally I e-mailed theirSupport group, after several e-mails back and forth they determined thatthe second unit was defective and I should return it.How can you store your (precious) data on a storage medium that is poorlymanufactured. I can understand one defective device, but two is really abad sign."
2,backup drive,"SimpleTech SP-U35/320 SimpleDrive 320 GB 3.5-Inch USB 2.0 Portable Hard DriveThe drive works fine. There were no instrctions in the box other then warnings and notes to MAC users. It said their was a quick start guide, but there wasn't any. The backup software is difficut to use and confusing."
3,Requires AC power supply,"Disappointed to find out that it really does require the AC power supply. Perhaps other models do not, but the SP-U35/500 in my box must be plugged in to work."
1,not a good product.,"Mounting the hard drive is very brief.Two screws fix the hard drive, not very realistic to maintain equipment which in 5400 revolutions per minute. Too many game between the disc and support fixing.I do not think it's Pininfarina."
5,Hurricane Recovery,I own this exact drive and during Hurricane Gustav my house flooded and it fell over into the water. The drive was unpowered at the time at least. I took apart the whole unit and let it air dry for two weeks. I purchased a new external HD case because I was scared to use the Simpletech one and I dont have a PC with a SATA interface and guess what! I was able to extract every bit and byte of data from my drive. not a drop of water entered the drive. I don't know if there are cheaply sealed drives verses well sealed drives but the one in my Simpletech External 500 USB was watertight. I had to put the data on a few different computers since it was so much and none of my PCs had that much room. I am about to order another Simpletech 500 Gig drive to put it all back on. I can't say they are all watertight but mine was. So they have my trust.
2,got two bad drives,"I got the SimpleTech 1TB ""designed by Pininfarina"" USB drive from a local store in Vancouver, Canada about two months ago. It worked fine to back up my Mac using Time Machine. I was pretty happy with it. So, I purchased three more SimpleTech ""designed by Pininfarina"" 1TB USB drives days ago. However, one drive didn't spin. (No vibration even though the power indicator was on.) Another drive didn't mount. I tried both drives on two Macs. No luck. I didn't want to risk opening the last drive. The person at the store's return & exchange department checked one drive, and he couldn't connect it to the store's PC. So, I got my money back.I am not going to assume what went wrong. Just be sure you buy it from a place that has a great return policy."
1,Don't buy if you want your data safe,"I bought this in good conscience after reading some positive reviews, at the time. I wish I had waited. Go read the reviews now, nine months after the fact. I've been to several sites and many people are having the same problem. The drive crashes and all your data is toast. It will make a chirping/growling noise, and your computer will not recognize it. So, after trying to make sure my data was safe after a harddrive crashed in my brand new laptop, I was stupid enough not to retrieve ALL saved data from the external, and now all that was not saved is gone forever. I give up. Is there no product that is problem free???So if you value the data you put on this SimpletonDrive, make sure you also back up somewhere else, because one day you'll turn it on and it will all be gone...."
2,Easy Plug-n-Play but quality worries,"Setup was a snap, file copy was adequate and ran a full Norton Ghost backup (about 150G) without a hitch. Copied the files to the device from a Vista machine, extracted them from an XP machine.There was something that sounded like a little screw rattling around inside the casing. It arrived that way and I'm going to assume that it didn't shake loose during shipment, but was the result of an inadequate QA process. I returned it and will probably look for a completely different brand since I don't trust SimpleTech now -- as a company."
1,good news: it came with a warranty,"this hard drive failed after one month.granted, I used it rather heavily, and it was on for at about 12 hours every day. It became hot, especially at the bottom, and it started making beeping noises every once in a while before it failed.Now, the fan has all but stopped spinning and the hard drive may not be read from any computer.If anyone is planning to use this drive heavily i would strongly urge them to get another one. For more casual use, perhaps it will suffice, although make sure to back up any critical data that you might be storing on it."
5,320GB Simple Drive,"It does what it needs to do. It says 320GB but you only get 300. For the price I paid for its, its a great product."
4,Great Product - Works as advertised,Having never used this company's products in the past I was a little hesitant. The product arrived and contained everything that was promised. I've been using it for about a month or so and am pleased at it's speed and reliability. Would recommend this product and this company to a friend.
1,RIPPED OFF,The shiipping cost was very high on this! I felt ripped off when I got this for this coupld have fit in a regular business envelope and a postage stamp used.
5,Keep your writing neat in your last written book of secrets,"I still write out some of my working documents. Like account info, and keep it in a special little book. You want to be able to edit this stuff, and you want to do it neatly. The only way is with a thin mechanical pencil, a gum eraser and a shield. But try to buy one of these!! Walk into an office supply store and the employees, if you can tear them away from texting, think you are speaking a foreign language. This little item was perfect."
3,Not what I thought.,"Its a great book if you are a fan of Gimenez's work. However I was hoping for more of a breakdown of the process which he uses to create these pieces. They touch on it very briefly, and even the question of media used is not asked.Lots of nice art though."
2,Disappointing,"If you want a book to help you help you understand how to sail a laser, this isn't it!As well as being very dated (it seems all the photos were taken in the 70's) subjects as vital as tacking is explained in four bullet points, with no photos."
2,The complete *HISTORY* of laser sailing,"I enjoyed reading this book mainly because Bruce Kirby explains how he started designing and how the thing grew up. I found this alone is worth the price.On the other side the first edition of the book was published about 35 years ago, and most of the articles and the pictures seem to be left unchanged. I'd say almost the same about sailor's interviews.It would be a good book with an another title: the Complete History of Laser Sailing.If you're looking a way to improve your sailing technique, choose something else:RYA Laser HandbookorThe Laser Campaign Manual"
2,There are better choices,"This book covers a lot of basics, but was not well-updated since its original publication. Too much irrelevant information on how to rig the old version of the Laser is included, and there are too many very dated interviews. Its hard to sort out whats new and pertinent and what's old and to be ignored."
2,Outdated,"This book was fairly complete at the time of its publication, but there have been so many significant improvements and new approaches to the C++ language that the book is outdated. I'd recommend this book only to people who are interested in a historical collection of C++ documents.I'd recommend any of the other Stroustrup books. ""The C++ Programming Language,"" (3rd edition) is the closest thing to a bible for the language. (Don't buy the 1st or 2nd edition--they're also outdated. If you want a hard-covered reference, the ""Special Edition"" is a hardcovered 3rd edition.) I'd recommend ""The Design and Evolution of C++,"" which is slightly outdated but both imformative and instructional to experienced C++ programmers."
2,Outdated,"A good reference in its time, this book does NOT describe the latest (November 1997) C++ language standard."
5,BEST for those who want to dive into the SECRETS of C++,"Well, I know it was out there. But I was referring other books most of the time. I paid for that. Many cannot answer questions like ""Why the hell you need a COPY constructor in the first place?"" or ""Why Copy Constructor always takes a reference to the object as an argument"". Here I found the answers. Again this is the BEST reference book available. If you are a serious programmer who wants to know in and out of C++, this is a must. I won't recommend this for those ""POOR"" souls who just want to be a C++ programmer.Again being a reference book, you don't have to read the PREVIOUS chapters to understand a specific topic. You may have to read couple of times to understand certain sections."
4,Outdated but still accurate,Yes it is outdated as it does not cover the latest features added to the standard. However it does describe in great details the core language and it is still the most detailed book about C++ to my knowledge after the C++ standard document text itself. Even the latest edition of 'The C++ programming language' book does not provide as much details about the language itself.
3,Needs to be updated.,This book was good when it came out in 1990. It needs to updated to to the newer versions of C++. Other than that it is a good book.
5,love to travel,"This is the third ""Dummies"" book we have used for travel. They give great advice in a quick, easy user-friendly format."
1,Spain for Dummies,"I have written the dealer associated with Amazon about the out of date ""Spain for Dummies"" and never gota response. This book was copyrighted in 2001 and among other things does talk about the Euro currency as a the new single currency and that you will still be charged in pesetas, which is not true. The book is totally out of date. We didn't even take it on our trip to Spain. Would like to return it. Anita Kersch"
3,ok but not as good as a Jeeves/Wooster story,"A collection of reasonably amusing stories (with the exception of the hat story, which you can safely skip).However, the stories lack the spark of a good Jeeves and Wooster novel, so you will want to read all those first."
3,"Does the job, a few gripes","Good stuff, but there is room for improvement. The software runs incredibly slow on my machine, unlike other programs. The labels will tear unless you detach them with *great* care, a very time-consuming process which I feel is unnecessary. But once the label is on it looks great.C."
5,ENCOUGAGEMENT!,This book is not just on WICCA it also encourage you to think for yourself! PLEASE tell me what is wrong with that? A GREAT BOOK! Every Wiccan/Witch need to read this book male and female. THINK FOR YOURSELFS!
1,"FAKE Wiccan, in his own words","[...]A.J. Drew wrote these books, many of which insult the Pagans that paved the way for the rest of us like the Farrar's and Buckland, ONLY for the money. He says so in his OWN words.Quote A.J. Drew -""In court, as if this were the 16th century, I have been accused of being a Witch. This either because several years ago I wrote some New Age titles or because today I am a practicing Catholic. I can not be sure why they are so concerned with my religious preferences, but the supervisor demanded that I tell her my religious preferences in court while she was testifying against my sanity. It was as if she felt all Catholics or members of other religions to which she does not subscribe are insane."""
3,Interesting but not what I was looking for,I found the book to be very interesting but not helpful in explaining to a child what Wicca really is about. However on the brighter side of things I think the author did a great job at providing a lot of spiritual insight for a lot of non Christian Individuals I would recommend this book to an adult but not a beginner or child who is still discovering what Wicca is about.
1,"Nice idea, but not worth the $$","Yes, the products are nice and work well, but buy them in a different bundle or seperately in full size and skip this ""kit."" The callous remover is worth about a dime. As soon as you apply any pressure it bogs the motor down. What do you expect when it runs on a C-cell battery? The device is best left as a lint remover and kept away from your feet. The pumice stone is just your typical stone. The clear plastic box is a neat idea, it's just too small to do anything with."
1,Not Impressed,I purchased the Dr. Scholls pedicure device to remove callouses and it was the worst investment I ever made. I only wish I could get my money back. The sander doesn't remove rough skin at all. You would accomplish as much rubbing a cotton ball over your feet.
4,"The ""Bible"" of the cattle industry.",When my chldren and I fisrt ventured into our 4-H Club/Calf experience this was the book we found . When we search for other sources of beef cattle information most other books come up short in depth and scope. The only other sources we trust are our experienced local cattle breeders and the vets that are beef specialists and even they tell us to look to this book as the final source.I've given this book 4 stars only because it's depht sometimes reaches to the scholarly level. That's why I tell my wife I'm giving myself a collage education in beef when I read this into the late hours of the night.Use this book as the first and last word when you need to gain beef cattle experience. It's in your library too. But it will look good on your own shelf when you need to use it in an emergency late in the night.
5,Nostalgic,"My grandmother was a Harvey Girl, thus, my mother thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It's provided much nostalgia for her, especially reading about some of the people who used to visit her family!"
