2,A Very Dull and Uninteresting Event,"Ultimate Fighting Championship is a U.S.-based mixed martial arts (MMA) organization, currently recognized as the major MMA promotion in North America.UFC 53 - Heavy Hitters is very drab and uninteresting Mixed Martial Arts event. The card is chock full of of B-level fighters who do not deserve nor belong on a stage as large as the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The UFC Heavyweight division is nothing but a terrible joke and the main event of Arlovski vs Eilers(a bum) is ridiculous. There are only a handful of fighters you can consider top 10 on this entire fight card.With that said, there are a few interesting bouts. The Rich Franklin/Evan Tanner fight is somewhat entertaining as is the Karo Parisyan/Matt Serra bout.In the end, save your money. This is a pretty lackluster not worthy of your hard earned dollars. The UFC is not on the same level as PRIDE FC and UFC 53 really illustrates this point."
4,"""decoration""","First of all, I would not call these ""toys"". I used them has Halloween decorations, and they were a fun way to bring my favorite movie into my decor. They are on the small side, but the description does say ""7 inches"". I'm happy with my new decorations, and have moved them to my toy drawer for visiting little ones."
4,collector's item,I bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it. She kept it close for a while and then she asked her mother if she could put it in her mother's curio cabinet so she had something of her's to look at in the display. They both enjoy it now.
3,Ha Ha Ha,It's so funny. A hilarious book you just can't put down. Why? Because they were actually serious. It is the Plan 9 From Outer Space of the book world.So called proof the world was going to end soon and everyone reading that book new (In the 1920s) would live to see the end of the world. Of course the generation old enough to read that book is well past their 90s and mostly dead.
3,A REAL CLASSIC,"I GAVE THIS 3 STARS FOR THE FACT THAT THE MOVIE WAS SO HARD TO WATCH DUE TO THE TRACKING PROBLEM, OTHERWISE IT WAS JUST LIKE I WATCHED WHEN I WAS A KID."
3,Essential Israeli Pop Classic,"Gidi Gov and Danny Sanderson are two icons in Israeli culture that helped shape the direction of their nation's popular music from the 1970's to the present. There is a reason that Poogy (Kaveret) has been referred to as the ""Israeli Beatles"". The quality of Sanderson's songwriting, and Gov's singing form a team whose dynamic can be compared to the magic of Lennon and McCartney. This early piece of their work is not to be missed."
1,Switched part.,"I paid for Intel Corp. (BX80536GE2266FJ) Pentium M 780 Boxed CPU 533FSB which is the boxed cpu and costs more. Instead, I received RH805367605A332 which is the tray cpu and costs less. I did not receive the price difference as a credit. Bait and switch? I will not buy from Mega Micro Devices again."
4,Vandoren 56 Rue Lepic Bb Clarinet Reeds #3,Nice reeds but I am still searching for the perfect reed. I look for a darker deep sound since I play in an orchestra.
3,You get what you pay for.,"If all you want is a cheap shifter for your second bike that you don't ride too often, or if it's for a kid's bike that's only going to be ridden a year -- this will do the job and the price is right.If this is your main bike and you ride a lot -- spend the money for a better shifter. It's not very smooth, it's kind of sloppy and I have my doubts about how much wear and tear it will take.I only paid $80 for the bike to start with, so the cheap shifter works fine for it. I have since upgraded to a better bike and just keep the old bike to ride in the mud or for a vistor who wants to share a leisurely ride about town -- for that it's fine. In fact, for that purpose it was the perfect purchase -- for a small amount of money I now have a serviceable second bike."
2,Would You Like Some Grape Leaves With Your Salt?,"I've been eating stuffed grape leaves for decades and these are far and away the worst ones I've ever had. They ARE edible, yes. But they're so incredibly salty that I'm eating them at about 1/10 of the pace that I normally would (especially considering how many cans I now have). Bottom line: spend a little more money and get something better.P.S.: Another reviewer remarked on how some of the cans were dented in transit. That was the case for me too."
3,Yeah?,These are not the best stuffed grape leaves out of a can. Sultin brand is better. Th leaves are very firm though.
4,Great gloves for general use,"Really like these gloves. Great for general yard use, working with raspberries, wood, leaves, mowing, etc. I would highly recommend."
4,Great Little Book,I bought this book as a gift for a shot glass collector. This will certainly give him tips on what to look for and how to look for incredible collector items. Recommend this book for the beginner/novice shot glass collector.
4,Very Informative,"The author of this guidebook has written a number of books on shot glasses and glassware in addition to other collectables. He is very knowledgable on the subject.This 1992 book starts out with a history of drinking and patterns of drinking then it gets into a history of glassware in Europe and America- all of this is very interesting. Then it gets into shot glasses and their history.The shot glasses shown are all black and white drawings and not actual color photos and although this does give a good idea, it's not as good as a color picture. I see that he has done books that do show color photos but this is not one of those. For shot glass collector's, this is a very useful, fun and informative guide on their hobby. But it falls a bit short in the photo department so it only gets 4 stars."
3,"Poetic and dark, but empty","It was a very promising book, and the first few pages of the first story engaged me so much I had to buy the book. While the writing was notable and well crafted, nothing touched me. It was as if the author expected that by merely observing dark realities this would automatically make me feel something - she failed to make me really care about any of the characters. The stories made me exhausted and kind of frustrated, because they all held so much promise and yet in the end, were nothing. But these certainly are engaging stories, and remind me of songs that you like but don't love, that are just on the edge of making you feel something, but don't go anywhere."
2,Lackluster and unsatisfying,"I picked up this book, fascinated by the title and even more so by the content of the book. I bought it, brought it home, and read it. Sadly to say, though, I was not impressed by Nugent's prose. I hoped for more details, but the story was detached, and the characters were underdeveloped."
2,Look at us!,"I love reading and rereading books about epic canoe or kayak trips. Most of these books let you into the wilderness experience. Some let you into the author's head, to understand the wonder, peace, loneliness and fear of long solo trips. Some introduce you to people met along the way, sometimes through rose coloured glasses, sometimes with no holds barred.Unfortunately the focus of this book seems to be the authors themselves and how they impressed the people they met.I would recommend the following books:Into the Great Solitude : An Arctic Journey Coke Stop in Emo : Adventures of a Long-Distance PaddlerArctic Adventures : Exploring Canada's North by Canoe and Dog TeamKabloona in the Yellow Kayak : One Woman's Journey Through the North West PassageGoing Inside : A Couple's Journey of Renewal into the NorthArctic Crossing : A Journey Through the Northwest Passage and Inuit Culture."
4,"Where rivers ""mostly"" run","I found the McGuffins' story both engrossing and disturbing. Joannie just tells the truth: Many of the worst challenges of their pretty incredible, well planned, rugged and successful trip resulted from industrial development such as sewage and tanker propwash on the St. Lawrence R., and pollution, flooding and ecosystem destruction caused by hydroelectric dams in the more remote parts of the old NWC/HBC route through Cumberland House. But the friendliness and helpfulness of the people they ran into in remote places is still there and so is their infectious wonder at unspoiled wildness in the many places where they found it. The challenge for all of us seeking a nostalgic reconnection to unspoiled nature and history is to find and enjoy it under a mostly distressing overlay of increasing environmental abuses. Joannie succeeded despite the odds. The McGuffins' story was an eye-opener and page-turner for me."
4,"A ""Real Life"" Mermaid...",My 5 year old daughter loves this toy. She loves that she can take the tail off and she becomes human. (just like in the Disney movies) She's a great swimming. FUn for the tub and pool. Fun to play with out of the water as well.
4,Agnus Dei,"If you listen to this CD in the dark you'll get chills down your spine. The use of the boy soprano and the monk-singing really beautiful and dark at the same time. I didn't like the action-cues a lot because there's too much drums in them. The ""Main Titles"" uses the most beautiful choir-music I've ever heard since ""Duel of the fates"" from Star Wars. I' m not a religious guy at all but I defenitly love the dark, religious style of this music because it is powerful and filled with emotions. A must for every Score-Collector!"
1,A True One for The Score,"The score for this movie was at least as bad as the movie, they both make me want to sleep but are annoying enough to keep me up. The music just isn't any fun to listen to, it's not beautiful, it's not mysterious, it's not good. I thought I would have a great cd with this because I had loved the scores to The Rock and Gladiator, but End of Days was a big disappointment."
3,Choice of a Lifetime,"Who did the editing & critiquing of this book? It was a GOOD book. When I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down. You have a fan for life. I'm looking forward for the next book."
1,Avoid at all costs,I thought this would be a cool movie. It turned out to be horrid. The actors were poor and the characters were annoying as hell. But the most irritating thing BY FAR was that this was a total Christian recruitment film. In the end it was all about how pagans are lost and confused and that Jesus is the answer to everything. So disrespectful to other spiritual paths!
2,Worth it only for Campo fans,Bobby Campo is shirtless through most of the movie. That's a plus. The rest is terrible. A mix of many movies. Nothing original except that perhaps the possessed person is male instead of female.
4,Hurricane : Not bad,"This book is a great compilation about this ledgendary war machine. It gives a good background to the making of arguably the best fighter aircraft of the day. Hurricane also goes in depth about the special features involved in this plane, as well as some of the highs and lows of fighting in these sleek machines, often with thrilling battles against ME109's, the Hawker Hurricane's nemisis."
2,Mediocre,"I was let down by this book which I purchased thinking that it will contain new information and unpublished photographs. Neither is true: the text is very poor in hard data, the chapters are too short, the maps average and most of the photographs have been published many times over the years. The serious student of the Vietnam War should better spent his or her money in the old but excellent multi-volume series of Boston Publishing ""The Vietnam Experience"" to get a wealth of photos and the analysis also. As far as the strategy of Vietnam War is concerned, Palmer's ""Summon of the Trumpets"" is unsurpassed."
2,Poor effort,"This DVD is marketed as the utlimate documentary on Operation Valkyrie. It doesn't come close to the Oscar-nominated ""Restless Conscience."" It has some good content but there is far too much filler and the story of the July plot is not put solidly in its context as part of a German Resistance movement that spanned 1933-1945. The live recreations are laughable in terms of casting and accuracy and the ""interviews"" with experts and surviving family members consist of 2 to 3 sentence snippets. This could have been so much more. The second disc of extras has some good stuff but why add an hour of Eva Braun's home movies? What does that have to do with killing Hitler? It just more padding to look like value added. This is a cheaply produced and amateurish ""Valkyrie"" rip-off.Colin"
3,"Uneven and biased, yet interesting as well","As a history teacher, it is not always easy to catch the attention of high school students. The series does this fairly well, but there is a left-leaning bias that must be fleshed out with proper discussion, as well as presidents from both parties who get a pass or are skewered without proper balance. Clinton's presidency is made to look like one huge scandal. Nixon is ripped apart with little mention of his tremendous accopmlishments in office. Reagan is brushed off as little more than boob who stumbled into good fortune. One would think that Carter is the closest thing to a saint on Earth. Did they really have to focus on Taft's weight so much? It would have been nice if the producers told the truth about Wilson: that he would be appalled today at what the Fed has become (and also the constant picketing of women in front of the White House). Well, any decent history teacher with a fair degree of knowledge can augment the program."
4,Short and to the point,"I brought this vedio for my home schooling class. I needed something short to the point and entertaining. This is it! There is even a bonus section on the presidents wivies, now that section was entertaining. The latest edition has added President Obama. I recommend this series...."
1,"Less history, more propaganda","As a student of history I felt that this is one of the least historically accurate productions the History Channel has given us. If you want to teach children about the presidents I would recommend this from George Washington up to McKinley. But from Teddy Roosevelt up to the current president, this show is full of left-wing stealth bias that will enhance your child's public education brainwashing.The show's depiction of modern presidents is entirely inaccurate. The show also chose to focus on less important aspects of each president's term.I would recommend watching this show on history channel before purchasing it. If your political stance is more left wing then I would suppose that this show would be perfect for you and your children. Anyone who expects a non-biased depiction of our US presidents, you'll have to pass on this collection."
4,Pretty good,"It would take thousands of hours to create a comprehensive historical analysis of these fellas. This program was a fair and interesting set of facts and folklore about the men of the executive branch. I would recommend viewing this and purchasing it for the home or public library. This was well done. One nice thing to note about this and other History channel presentations is to add that good authors with interesting viewpoints were included in the interviews and lectures. Also consider ""A History of God"" by The History Channel."
4,The Presidents,I bought this DVD after seeing it on the History Channel. I loved the way the History Channel presented the story of each president. It made learning about the Presidents attainable and comprehensive. I bought it because I am a history teacher and felt that it taught the children about a president in a quick and concise manner.
1,Terribly biased,"Having been a student of history for years, I was appalled at The History Channel's portrayal of our Presidents. After all, what right-minded individual would feel compelled to characterize Jimmy Carter(a known anti-semite) as merely a victim of circumstance? Likewise, Ronald Reagan is portrayed as an oaf who stumbled blindly into pure luck and managed to make few decent decsions. Nonsense. This is simply more leftist propaganda distributed from a network I always believed to be fair. If I could have given this product 0 stars, I surely would have."
3,Warren Harding is a good president??,"I enjoyed most of it, however I found that there was a major slant to the right. Herbert Hoover and Warren Harding were called fair to good presidents?? Who are we kidding. AS someone who is going to be going to grad school for American presidential History, even most right wing scholars would lump Harding and Hoover into the bad category!I did however like hearing about people like Polk who WERE fairly good presidents.I would buy it!"
3,Well written only two problems,"I thought the History Channel document of the Presidents was really well written and very good. I enjoyed watching about the presidents we all know about and learning about ones we rarely hear about like Buchanan, Arthur, Polk among others. My only complaints were the opinion of James Madison and War of 1812 deserved a lot more credit. It was the only war in which our country was invaded by another. James Madison is the only president during a time when our capital was sacked. I would of liked to of seen more about his presdency and how he managed to keep the country and politicans together after such an event.My second problem was why during Wilson's term they didn't mention the women picketing right in front of the White House day in and day out."
2,Terrible Production Values,"The information and the interviewees provide an interesting narration. Unfortunately the producers apparently had no faith in the quality of the material, and marred the production with weird music and frantic editing."
3,Fascinating Until Reagan,"I purchased this and love it... It is fascinating all the way through except once you get to the modern group. I feel they focused on Reagan's negatives and made him look at an idiot and discredited his impact in America. They gave Carter an open opportunity to defend his administration himself on the video. I got the ""Pre-Obama"" (Carter - Bush 43) updated one which is good. I saw the Carter - Obama version on TV and an glad I do not have that one. They cut Bush's segment and added a bit on the ""Amazing Hope that Swept Across America"" and how America can finally look forward to it's future and all that drivel. Nothing factual. They should have waited till we had three more Presidents and done another special. Regardless of your feeling towards Bush or Obama... It was a puff piece and it is not History... it is adoration. Aside from that... It was a very good piece... Get the pre-Obama one if you can."
5,Timely,This product is excellent for teaching and historical review.We recieved it in a timely manner and just before the presidentialelection. It is a reminder that we have few great presidents and a lotof stinkers but there are always new elections to change things.
2,Ornament Display,I was not happy with the product and returned it. The individual rods did not fit into the holes and the stand therefore did not stan up straight. Not like the picture at all.
1,Don't Buy It!!!!,"The advertising here is such misleading. It said it can used to most of the devices, but when I received that from J&R, I found only one adapter without any tips inside. So basically if I want to use it, I have to spend more to purchase the tips for my laptop and DC. This is just like a trap, to make you spend extra money, and you will never end with the product you want. So, go to another product, dont trust this."
5,"lovely, lovely book","More than just the pillbox. Gorgeous dresses and charming suits, Jackie Kennedy always looked beautiful and elegant. This book is a lovely way to remember her."
4,Beautiful Book About a Beautiful Lady and Her Clothes,"If you enjoy fashion and Jacqueline Kennedy, then you will most likely enjoy this book. It is intersting to see Mr. Cassini's sketches next to the actual pictures of the garments. It is a coffee table type book that one would enjoy flipping through causally and not one that I would say one would want to read word for word like a novel."
4,Gorgeous!,"A divine coffee table book! The drawings and photos are beautiful, and the commentary (though not deep) is fun. A *must* for any Jackiephile."
3,Nightsky alternatives,"Well, I have to admit that I've been disappointed by BE's new album, too. The previous remix project ""Vertigo"" has left its marks: Now BE infuse their guitar-driven soundscapes with trip-hop beats reminiscent of Portishead and Massive Attack. But I think this trip-hop thing is more than half a decade old and it doesn't point this band into a new direction. ""Lushlife"" is a good album, but it lacks the magic of their self-titled debut and ""Beat"". The accompanying CD-Single ""Freedom fighter"" is a mediocre affair, too, containing two album tracks and two worthless remixes. After all, it seems as if the lights were going out for Bowery Electric."
1,ZZZzzzz......,"What a bore! Its been done before. And it adds nothing new to the genre. Like Hooverphonic and so many other ""portishead-biters"", they can imitate but not duplicate. The beats are unoriginal - creatively a weak effort."
3,Snore,"This album bored me to tears. I should probably give it a few more listens, but for now my rating out of 10 would be 6.5"
1,Rough...,"Be careful ordering from this provider. Maybe it's because it says poster ""print"", but they should at least get a better color copier or something. Extremely poor quality. The whole thing was just blurred garbage."
4,Are you sure he's part of the wu?,"I wasn't extremely disappointed to see no wu members on his cd cuz his first cd only had a couple wu, but damn if he is part of the wu he ought to have someone on it, at least meth, or u-god. I'll quit hating on that. If you've never heard Killah Priest he sounds exactly like Black Rob, but a lot better. My fav tracks are ""what part of the game"" ""gotta eat"" the track with canibus""i'm wit that"", and ""live by the gun"". In ""live by the gun"" Killah starts off fast and he sounds pretty tight. I wish he would rap fast more often. This cd is pretty tight though. It would have been 5 stars with some wu members, but go peep it! See for yourself."
5,I love this album!,"I love this album, it is so much better than ""Middle of Nowhere"" I recommend this to everyone..."
4,"Surprise, surprise!","To me, Hanson was always the squeaky-voiced ""Mmmbop""-ing boys who made pre-teen girls scream like burn victims...but when I heard this CD I was impressed overall. I'm saying this truthfully because I am NOT a Hanson fan but after a friend forced me to listen to this cd, I was surprised that I liked it! I even bought it because I was so impressed by their new sound! Kudos to Hanson for this album!"
5,A very underrated album,"Unlike some previous reviewers, I was mixed on Hanson's previous effort ""Middle of Nowhere."" It had some good songs but some filler too - especially on the second half. Not this one. It starts strong with ""You Never Know"" and continues with two very catchy but under played singles ""If Only"" and the title track. But it doesn't stop there - ""Save Me"" is a lovely ballad while ""In The City"" and the gospel tinged ""Dying to be Alive"" are stong efforts. There really isn't a weak song on the whole CD.The ""problem"" is that there really is nothing here like ""MMMbop"" to play on the radio. But as Hanson matures they seem to be moving away from teeny bopper style pop to a more traditional rock sound. That's good because while some similar groups will soon fade away I think Hanson will be around for quite some time. Not only is this a good CD, it shows Hanson has staying power."
5,damn those hanson brothers,"Well, I'm you typical 19 year old, likes hard rock, and heavy metal. Hates boy bands, and all things pop, yet after hearing the single TTA, I wore a hat, ducked my head, and bought this album. I'll admit I was all to eager to say what a crap attempt at a grown up cd this was, untill I heard it. Its Great! yes Great. I love all the songs, and the cd is one of my all time favs. The cd is grown up, and they don't sound like they're trying to hard to get that point across. They write all their own songs, and play their instruments, so before anyone puts them in the category of BSB, or Nsync, listen to the album, and I bet you'll be putting them in the category of Aerosmith, or Bon Jovi before long. Can't wait for their next one."
4,just as good as the debut album,"This album is just as good as the debut... even though the music on this one seem to be more hip-hop'ish. All the songs on this cd are awesome, and if you're looking to know which Hanson album has more listenable tracks.., the songs on this album may seem a bit too long just b/c they repeat the choris over and over. But as far as piano music, on This Time Around cd and Middle of Nowhere cd, the songs that are more intimate-sounding are better produced."
5,Better then the frist,Wow. If you liked the first Hanson CD then you won't have any problem with them. Besides being old and sounding more like adults. Hanson has become even cuter! This is one of my to five fave CD's. So listen to the samples and see for yourself.
5,Absolutely a 10!,"This album is great! They have grown and matured so much and you can hear it in their music. It's not like ""MmmBop"" but it's still GREAT music! They have a great diversity in their songs - there are slower, romantic songs like ""Love Song"" then their are rockin songs like ""Can't Stop"". All of the songs have meanigful, moving, and though provoking lyrics. In ""Sure About It"" they talk about depression and everything going wrong and then there is ""Hand In Hand"" which talks about getting over a break up and seeing your ex w/ someone else. What makes this c.d. even better is that they wrote all the music and lyrics for it along with playing their instruments and producing it. They have real talent! I hope they will be around forever!"
5,One of the best CDs ever,"I have to say that Hanson is not a thing like all those other boy bands out there today, they play, write and produce their own music and that shows what great talent they have. This is a album that so many people if they would just get over the fact that this is the same band that brought the world Mmmmbop and just put the CD in and listned to it would LOVE it. So everyone who is a fan of good music buy this cd!"
5,speechless,"... I love this CD more every time I hear it. They're almost a new band by comparison to the first!I think Hanson's critics cannot believe that 3 very young lads can pack such a wallop; they're just jealous. Some suggest these guys have no talent. What is talent? Does Ike play guitar like Eddie? Is Zac another Neal Peart or Buddy Rich? Is Tay ever confused for Pavarotti or Freddy Mercury for that matter? ""No"" to all 3 counts; though some day they might! BUT, are they the real deal? Are they a complete musical package? I can't think of any group with more true potential to leave a legacy. The fact that they had a lot of help doesn't negate their credibility, it edifies it; their guest artists are accomplished enough to turn down any illegitimate gigs.Bummer that they have to meet such high expectations, Next Time Around...."
5,Best Hanson's album....like the others!,"I love this group since the first albumThey are very talented, i'm sure about it.Music and vocals are very good, but they can do better. I'm waiting for the new album...My favorite songs ---> all!!!!But,'sure about it', i don't know why, i listen to it all the time.Stop saying they making teen pop or stuff like that! They rock!!!"
5,Brilliance,"This album is truely brilliant. I'm a huge Hanson fan and Middle of Nowhere is a great album, although real poppy. This time around is a huge difference, great melodies coupled with harmonies that stand out above the rest. Truely awesome album, every song is superb!Buy it!"
4,No Longer A Teeny Bopper Band,"There's good news and bad news to this groups reputaion. The good news is that these boys have grown up and matured, and so has their music. The bad news is that these boys have grown up and matured, and so has their music! This is a great album, but unfortunatly the kids that were buying their last album wouldn't be interested in their new sound, and people my age wouldn't think of giving Hanson a try. I heard them on tv in a concert, and that is why I was interested in this album. Hanson should market themselves to the adult contemporary. If you like the Gin Blossoms or the Bodeans you'll like this album."
5,A Great CD!,"This CD is almost NOTHING like the other one. Of course, it's the same 3 people, Isaac, Taylor, & Zac - but they're a lot older, and they definetley show it in their new album, This Time Around. Their debut album, Middle Of Nowhere, had a major pop sound to it. But, their sound matured along with their age. This new album has more of a rock sound, instead of pop. And all of the songs are written very well, and I can relate to almost all of them at some point. I give theis CD 5 stars because it really deserves it. Hanson are back, and this time, better than ever! :)"
5,"""This Time Around"" is the BEST cd ever!","Hanson fan or not, this is the best cd I've heard in my life! If you don't have it BUY IT! Believe me! Hanson is the best band in this world and This Time Around is their best cd ever!"
1,They're finished,"Hanson has sunk to an all time low. I didn't think it could get much worse than that joke of a song ""Mmm bop"". What kind of a song is named ""Mmm bop""? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. But anyway, the Hansons now think they are this bad rock group like Blink 182 or Kid Rock. They should be laughed right out of the music business for even thinking that. They sound exactly the same as they did on their earlier albums. They are also the most arrogant teenagers I have ever seen. When referring to Nsync, the baby Hanson said, and I quote, ""We sing better than they do."" I just have one question. What do girls see in them? They are SO UGLY! Especially the old one. Are teenage girls so desperate that they need to idolize those UGLY guys?"
2,"SO YOUNG, SO HEARTLESS ...","It's incredible how these boys already have lost all their creativity and sold themselves to the system of the great record companies .... This album is heartless, uninspired, just a bunch of kid guided by smart grown-ups trying desperately to make huge money ( and getting it... ) THis CD is horrible,"
3,It's okay.,"The new CD from Hanson is okay. Every song is not good and sometimes it gets, to be honest, a bit hard listening to Isaac's voice in the most horrible song on the CD ""Hand in Hand"". But true, Hanson has matured and they are NOT what they used to be... The feeling of the album is 'yeah, this is cool'. And when you sit back and listen to the lyrics and really focus on the songs, you'll realise that this can't possibly be the ones who wrote MMMBop three years ago. I think it's a great CD to put in your collection, so, why not?"
2,Catchy I suppose...,"Hanson has never really impressed me. The songs aren't that clever and good voices aren't too hard to come by these days. This latest merging of their poppy past with phishy jam-rock sounds to me like a desperate (and probably successful) attempt at not being a one-hit wonder novelty act. but the songs themselves are bland and barely stand out in these last few years of ultra-happy mtv pop that the brothers hanson helped bring about. while it can be enjoyable at times i can't give it a solid review and would gladly reccomend the Apples In Sterio's new album ""The Discovery of the World Inside the Moone"" over Hanson. Now THAT is a truly innovate pop group."
3,A Fair But Disappointing Album,"The first two songs are quite good!, but the rest have vapid lyrics that give me a headache. After a 3 year hiatus, one would expect a much better album from the Highly Talented Hanson. Spend a little more time on the HIGHLY REPETATIVE LYRICS. If both the music and lyrics were up to par this might have been THE Album of the Year. I've been listing since the Coffeyville, Kansas Concert; I KNOW you can do better. Oh, and the E-CD all to hock your Net Access, not Cool. GRADE: C-"
3,Par for Hanson course,"I've read reviews about how ""mature"" and ""talented"" Hanson has become. The fact is, this band had talent when they were playing ""MMMbop"" - after all they were still riding bikes. This Time Around is an improvement on the band's other work, because it is better songwriting, period. The problem is that they still rely on sacharin sweet sentimentallity and sing of hardships and heartbreak that I'd be willing to bet these green, pampered musicians have never come close to being able to relate to. ""If Only"" is a energetic and fun song, and ""This Time Around"" is actually a very musically diverse blues track. Taylor Hanson plays a mean keyboard/B3. Unfortunately, the trio has too much control over the production of their work. If they would let the experts - people who have worked in the industry for more than 6 years - steer them, they might turn out a better album. It's fun, but could be better."
4,Just more Rock'n Roll,"This album is completely amazing ! It starts with ""you never know"" a pop rock song extremely nice. Then ""If only"" which is maybe one of the song that reminds me the most the sound of their first album, because all the next songs are just more... Rock'n Roll and really good. There're also beautiful songs such as ""save me"",""love song"" or ""a song to sing"" (which is probably the most beautiful). ""This time around"" is definitely a great album."
5,Awesome,I really like the new sound. Its more mature. I think its something a lot of people can relate to because it does have thr rock sound. Its moved up to more of a rock sound then pop/bubblegum. Very good cd!
4,they're back...and they're all grown up!,"My buds and I have been avid Hanson fans since they first came out. I had the posters on my wall, the t-shirts in my closet, and the stickers on my notebooks. Ok, well I eventually took down some of the posters and stuff, but since I got TTA, I haven't listened to any of my other cd's. It's awesome....I mean, AWESOME! Even though I loved their other cd's, I have to say their music has really matured and is a lot better. Some of my friends at church, who are very musically inclined, have admitted that Hanson has some great talent. I definitely recommend this cd to everyone, even if didn't totally dig their first cd's."
4,These kids really rock!,"Hanson unfairly got lumped in with the boy band explosion because of their bubblegum hit ""MMMBop"" off their debut album MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. But THIS TIME AROUND shows that Zac, Taylor and Isaac, far from being one-hit wonders, have the talent to back up their early success -- and then some.Don't let the sluggish sales of this album keep you from buying it. Hanson clearly opted for artistic growth over commercial appeal, which is not to say they haven't recorded a fun album. Although none of the singles achieved the popularity of ""MMMBop"", this CD is full of great singalong tunes. Some favorites are ""Can't Stop"", ""You Never Know"", ""If Only"" and the great title track.Hanson chose to do an old-fashioned rock n' roll album this time around, and their accomplished songwriting shows they know their music history. Long after NSYNC says ""Bye Bye Bye"" for good and the Backstreet Boys are all in rehab, Hanson will still be around, probably rocking harder than ever."
5,Knowledge delivered effectively is empowering!,"In this indispensable guide, Dr. Baker gives parents and educators solid tools and strategies to embrace what's unique about our students in a way the adds ease and empowerment to the process."
4,Pretty Good,"One of my sons is seeing a therapist & she has stated that she feels he has some traits of AS. Well, after looking into it more, it would seem that both of my sons do. They are 15 & 20 and both of them enjoyed this book & seeing their own traits along with the traits of other family members being pointed out. The good thing is that it also gave them insight into why other people respond to them the way they do. I think this book will help them both in relating to other people. This has been a very handy book for them. The only problem with this book is it can be pretty dry reading at times so they needed to take breaks in reading it some & this is from kids that really enjoy reading."
3,Good but too focused on social issues.,The first chapters are great in this book but the vast majority is a teaching plan for communication problems. The information is good but not exactly what I wanted as my son is already in these types of programs at school and at home. Theses social things need to be introduced from the time the kids are very young because it takes so long for them to learn. Its a bit late to start when the kid is almost an adult.
2,Not that good.,"it was okay, It wasn't too easy to use and My Son found it complicated. We did not have use for it."
4,For High School and College,"Dr. Jed Baker's book is very helpful to prepare young adults/teens with resume/interviewing skills to obtain jobs, and interact with different types of people, advocate for themselves. I can use it for my own 18 year old son with AS and with my clients in my psychotherapy practice. Worth the price."
3,Power button stops working after 2 years,"I am a PC gamer and had this monitor for over 3 years now and all of the sudden the power button stops working after 2 years. It turned out it was hardware problem. The circle shape power button was off and after adjusted it back to the center (used scotch tape to turn), I was able to use the power button. In order to stabilize the power button from moving again, I sealed the power button with the clear scotch tape so it won't turn to side. I recommend 27"" ViewSonic 1ms Full HD 1080P - it has better graphic and price."
1,Customer Support is a NIGHTMARE,"I have owned this display for eleven months. It is a nice product until it fails. Mine has failed twice. Then you are relegated to Dell Hell. I bought a five-year advanced exchange warranty for the product yet it is nearly impossible to enforce. Dell requires a SERVICE TAG to talk, email, or chat with them. Displays don't have them. You must call customer support, be subjected to long holds, and serviced by people who are unintelligible and incompetent. They will then botch the call requiring you to start and repeat the process over and over again. You feel you are caught in the movie, ""Groundhog Day"". My latest adventure has gone on for six hours over three days. They shipped the replacement display to the wrong city although I verified and re-verified they have the correct address. Unless you enjoy pain, do not buy from Dell. I still don't have the replacement.AVOID DELL UNLESS YOU ENJOY PAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Bad power button,"The Dell 2407WFP has a bad power button, which appears to be an inherent design flaw in the product. Note that even under pretty light usage, it went bad. Do a google search for ""2407WFP power button"" and you'll gets lots of results showing others having the same problem. Otherwise, it has been a nice display, love the 24"" size and 1920x1200 capability."
4,"Crisp, good quality display, USB may be defective, hot to the touch","The display is crisp and bright. I haven't noticed any dead or stuck pixels. It has a matte finish and there is no glare. The surrounding black frame also has a matte finish. To my eyes, the colors are reasonably accurate. However, I haven't done extensive image work nor have I played DVDs on it. This display has a USB hub with a flash card reader and the USB portion was defective in mine. I'm at an educational institution and Dell replaced at my mere report. The replacement unit has the same crisp display and so far its USB hub has worked. One last point, portion of the display is very hot to the touch. I don't know what the wattage numbers, but it is hard to see how this qualified for any energy star ratings."
1,Nice for the price but you get what you pay for,I loved this display until it stopped working. Owned it for 13 months before the power button broke and the monitor was stuck in the off position. A quick search will reveal that this is not an isolated incidence but clearly a design flaw. Keep looking and you'll find many posted workarounds. An apparently not so uncommon problem with the power button is that it somehow becomes loose and twists out of position. I used a safety pin to reorient the button allowing me to turn the display on but the button easily spins and stops working again. Luckily I found lots of good advice online. One post suggested using tape to keep the button in position. Another post suggested plugging the display into its own power strip and using that switch to turn it on and off while yet another suggested never turning the display off at all. If you're looking for a nice display at a reasonable price and don't mind this sort of nonsense then this product is for you.
3,Great for XP Vista - Marginal for Win 7,"I have had this monitor for five years. As long as I was using it with a computer running Windows XP up through SP3, it was a fabulous monitor - really great: color resolution, inputs, sharing, you-name-it.However, if you're upgrading to Windows 7, beware! There are no Windows 7 drivers at all, and trying to install the Vista 64 bit drivers doesn't work. Dell chose, for whatever reasons, not to provide Windows 7 support for this otherwise outstanding monitor.If you've got an XP machine you're not upgrading and can get a good one of these used for a reasonable price, you'll be thrilled with it!"
5,"Down to earth, practical, spiritual and possible.","Len's style is very friendly and conversational. He has huge amounts of experience, both failures and great successes. The book's great strength is that the reader can identify with the failures, start to believe the successes are possible and walk away with practical strategies to make youth ministry better. It is also a brilliant marriage of theology and plain old how to get it down. Highly recommended."
4,Great Pictures!,Great Pictures.The text of this book is interesting. It is a well done book. My grandson likes it and I enjoy reading it to him.
3,Eclectic Fun,"This book is not a coherent narrative. Each chapter covers a different topic, some of which are quite interesting (the chapter on housing, for example). Others, however, consist of nothing but long lists which represent inventories or catalogs, including such items as fabric types and medical remedies. These can be MANY pages in length, and should be considered more in the way of source material than analysis or narrative.As a result what's here is a mixture of highly enjoyable and tedium. If you're researching early fabric types or medical remedies, the lists might be just what you need. If not, you'll find yourself skipping a lot of pages. I'm not planning on getting rid of the book, but it's much more of a research tool than anything else."
5,"Future of Pop, if you wanna' call this 'pop'.","Gets my vote for Best New Band of 99-2000. What can I say, this is how you make a debute album, original and innovative. This is pop? Maybe so, but the guitars are a tad heavy for today's standard of 'pop' such as Goo Goo Dolls. But Whatever you want to lable it, this CD is breathtaking, and even backed up better by the group's stellar live performances. And well, it looks like my local boys' CD made it to at least Amazon. This the band's first CD and they literally BLEED talent. I'm pulling heavy that Edgewater will continue to grow and catch on. But for now, people that just happen to come across this title while browsing Amazon. Please, PLEASE buy it and support them. You won't be sorry."
5,A great security awareness tool.,"Winn has again produced a book that not only keeps you interested but adds to your knowledge base. He presents one of the most complete descriptions of the hacker culture that one is likely to find anywhere. By emphasizing privacy, he has picked a theme that everyone can related to. This book should be read in the board rooms of corporations and on Capital Hill. It should greatly increase the awareness of the risks we face in the cyber world."
1,Blatant plea for attention -- no real facts,"This book is similar to those ""When Animals Attack, Part 2"" shows on the Fox network -- and just as thoughtfully written. It's here to sell copies and get the author on the talk show circuit. You'll see him on ""Inside Edition"", ""Hard Copy"", and Ollie North's radio program.He cites ""studies"" but doesn't provide any details on those studies.He lumps the entire ""hacker"" world into one category.His psychological profiles would make an undergrad professor ill.Heck, this book doesn't deserve any more of my time for a review. If you must read it, read it as you would a bad spy novel, but don't tie it to the real world."
3,"It's not exactly bad, but...","I'm not saying not to read this book. If you're after info and facts, it's got a lot of them, and they're useful and thought provoking.At the same time, take it with a grain of salt. This book would have been much better written if the author had been able to take himself out of it a little more. His acedotes are amusing, but they give the whole book a feeling of condensation, a ""smarter than thou"" feeling. And it just got under my nerves.If you're reading it for the info, go ahead. If you're reading it for reading, try something else."
3,Sticky,"I really like the color of this lipstick/ glosser, but it's very thick, kind of makes your lips stick together, also, it's really expensive for what you get....if you don't mind those two things, then you will love it!"
1,GOOD QUALITY - - BAD QUANTITY,"9 PRODUCTS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE, JUST SEND 1, NOWHERE SAYS THAT IS A SINGLE UNIT FOR 19 U.S. $THAT INDICATES THE BUYER TO THE 9 ARE BUYING ITEMS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE."
4,Crowley's Tale,"This is the final book in the Serenity Falls trilogy. Originally written as one book, it was re-released as three. Each book is a story in it's self, the third is the climax of everyone's story with Jonathan Crowley as the main protagonist.Crowley is a hunter, more than, or, not human, but only when a supernatural threat is present. When amongst regular humans, Crowley is simply a cranky, curmudgeon of a man. A hunter who is very unsure of what is coming, only clear that something is near.The Dark Carnival is coming. A rotting fleshly train runs down train tracks that are broken and unusable. Tents grow, sprouting from the ground, on a farm where murder was done years ago. The stench of rotting flesh is rampant as the Big Top rises.More than one person comes forward to be heroic, some die, some do help. The story is fast, horrific and bloody. Not everyone can or will be saved. Believable, and well written. James A. Moore knows how to write, and I will continue to read his books."
3,How?,"A curse that effects an evil entity. Ok, but what's the entity. And doesn't anyone ever finally die? Why do some die and not others? Lot's of loose ends and questions at the end of a lot of story."
3,WINDING IT UP.,"This is the finale on the Serenity Falls Trilogy. Jonathon Crowley is the man. Or is he really a man? Is he even human? Anyway, the second book was like Star Wars 2 and there were a lot of loose ends. This one tied it up. The ending did get confusing because there were so many characters and a lot of them died, and came back."
2,too expensive & short rolls of film make this a bad choice,The printer and these cartridges are for suckers and that's how I feel after printing over 500 cards with this crummy printer. The cartridges rarely give me the 50 printed cards they promise and my last order had one cartridge that gave me fewer than 30 prints before it was ended.There are better bargains for this equipment with a much lower cost per card than this one.
5,great sci fi tale,"Any one who has ever read any of Zelaznys books (and enjoyed them) should try and get a copy of this one .The story is pure genius, although the plot has a few holes in it.It is the character Jackwho sets the book apart from the normal sci -fi ennui -You get half way through the novel and actually like Jack, even though he is a thief , murderer, out and out scoundrel. I actually wanted to meet him! I actually wanted to be himAlas! that was the magic of Roger ZelaznyTaken before your time Roger. I would have liked to have had the chance to meet youI hope somewhere you found Ambe"
2,Not sure what there was to like,"I like a lot of Zelazny's stuff, but this book did not do it for me. The science was pretty silly (a planet that stays still), and the world needed a bit more fleshing out. It's almost like a detailed outline. The scale of the story is huge but there's little or no detail. It would have been much better to see Jack in action stealing things and outsmarting people rather than conquering the world.I'm not sure I understand the symbolism of the story. If Morning star was trying to prevent Jack from following in his footsteps why did he have him do what he did?"
5,An underestimated work of Science Fiction/Fantasy brilliance,"This is one of my favorite books. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The world that Zelazny creates is a vivid and imaginative one, full of beauty and ugliness, light and darkness, good and evil. The book is all about duality. It is about objects and their opposites, ideas and there antithesis. And at the center of the work is Shadowjack, a character whose presence betrays the ideas in the rest of the book. He is a shadow, inbetween light and darkness. He is the grey between the white and black of the world in which he lives. This book is brilliant on so many levels. As a simple work of fiction it is entertaining and brilliantly written. As an allagory it is beautifully crafted and deeply moving. A must read. Buy this book and share it with others."
1,Does its job.,"This is a great idea, but its really flimsy. If you plan on putting laundry detergent on top [that's the only place it will fit] then you need to have heavier things on the bottom two shelves or it tips when you pull it out. Also, the hooks that connect the shelves fell off repeatedly. My husband had to zip-tie them on."
2,Poor Construction,"For the price, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but this is a very flimsy cart. I bought it to use as a rolling spice rack, and the cart can barely handle the spice jars. The one side of the cart has already broken, and I've had to tie it together. Plus, the wheels don't roll smoothly. The picture shows it as a laundry cart, but I honestly don't know how it would handle something as heavy as a detergent bottle. If that is your intended use, look for something made better."
1,Not worth a dime,"As the old saying goes ""You get what you pay for"". This is the worst product I have ever purchased. The wires in which the baskets hangs from (they are not secured by anything so the baskets comes off too easily) are thin and flimsy and soldered to the sides. Some of them came broken, so there was nowhere to hang one of the baskets.I didn't return it because the amazon outer box in which it came was broken and to repackage I would have to purchase another box which is not worth purchasing to send back an $18 item. But I certainly will not recommend to anyone. You are better off by putting two tops of boxes together and creating your own, it will be sturdier or maybe the dollar store would sell something that would be better than this could every be."
1,Cheap product,Product is cheaply made. The shelves do not actually attach to the sides. It wiggles anytime your ouch it. Only go thing I can say is that it does actually fit in the space I needed it and a three year old could have put it together.
1,Should have listened to the bad reviews,"Was so excited to get this to add to my new apartment - bleck! We thought we must have been missing something as once we put it together, it fell over. So wobbly, I can't imagine it could hold anything. Sending back immediately!"
3,"Handy Cart, but kind of flimsy","When the cart came a couple of the end bars had broken off where the shelves attach. Since they were not the ones required to attach the shelves and since returns are a pain, I just hot glued them back on and put it together. It fits well in the space I have and does everything I want it too. I just wish the quality were a little better."
1,7001 Resumes,"This is one of the worst resume books I have ever seen! It is poorly written, formatted atrociously, resume examples are awful (and there are no where near 7,0001 examples). Don't waste your money! I'm sorry that there are no options to give this a minus star rating."
1,Unusable,"This is the third or fourth book I've been working through to try to learn Japanese. I'm still a beginner but I've gotten some of the basics. I've made it as far as lessen 10 in Japanese for Busy People and I'm going to abandon the book and try another volume. I found the lessens to be unclear and the learning curve VERY steep. (Remember, I've been studying Japanese for some months, I know some of this material already). In my blog I referred to this book as Japanese for People Who Have Lots of Time to Study or Japanese for People Who Remember Everything They Have Ever Read. Maybe it works for other people, but for me and my learning style it was like beating my head against a wall."
1,not much use,"After struggling throught the first 6 chapters of this book I put it down, went to the library and checked out other books. While this book may be great in a classroom situation, its difficult for the independent learner to use. I found it particularly frustrating that grammatical rules would be given and then the examples to illustrate the rule didn't follow the rule, and the reader was left on their own to figure out why. The vocabulary was purposely kept to minimum; however, the terms were not of much use to the non-business traveler. Perhaps as a review manual this book is useful. To the beginner, not much use!"
5,Excellent,I received the book quickly and its condition was as good as described. Very happy. Thanks.The book itself looks very useful but will have to add to this when I have had more time to read it.
5,"Great, especially when used with other JfBP books!","I took a course using this book, amongst the regular reading book. I now have the CDs as well, and combined they are a VERY useful tool! This workbook is designed to back up the main book, and while still usable without the other book, I think someone who is trying to learn Japanese on their own would find it more beneficial to use both together. In this book, some of the picture's meanings in English aren't clear, so you often end up having to look in the reference portion to discover the meanings. However, if you have the other book, it explains a few things that this book is missing."
2,Passable but dissapointing.,"The problem with Japanese for Busy People is not so much the information that it contains, but what it DOESN'T contain and the way the information is presented. Though the opening section on kana was especially useful, all of the lessons essentially consist of memorizing vocabulary words vaguely related to 'foreign language' type subject such as ""At the movies."" Though some may prefer this methodology, I found the vocabulary and provided phrases especially lacking as far as practical implementation is concerned. All in all, though it wouldn't hurt to rent this book at a library, I don't recommend purchasing it for yourself."
1,The most confusing calculus book I have ever purchased,"This book is confusing in two ways: First, it launches into complex concepts, equations, problems and solutions without ever explaining the underlying fundamentals; the authors assume that the reader is already in command of many concepts and terms that would almost certainly escape a person who is ""Utterly Confused"" by calculus. Second, although the content of the book would be useful to a person who had successfully completed a formal education in calculus and was in need of a review, the authors chose to bill this book as a quick and easy way to understand the intricacies of calculus for those who have failed to grasp the basic fundamentals. They do a great disservice to the readers whom they dupe into buying this book by making false claims about its nature."
1,I'm sorry I wasted my money,"Based on the description of this book, I thought I could gain a better grasp of the subject, only to discover that I was more confused than when I started. New concepts are thrown out with no explanation and examples are obscure at best. To make things worse, the silly cartoon-like attitude of the book is insulting to anyone who's looking for a serious solution to their dilemma. The implication is that the material is as easy to understand as a child's book, but there is no help for those who don't immediately grasp the concepts. After completing a Calculus class (and feeling quite comfortable with the subject) I revisited the book and confirmed that it is a terrible presentation for those who are in fact ""Utterly Confused"". I have sent it unceremoniously to the local landfill."
3,Good Idea-less than perfect execution,"This little book is a terrific idea. However, it needed a careful editing before printing. The diagram on page 33 was not labeled. The answer on page 51 is wrong. The answer on page 55 contains an answer (t=533) that not only is wrong, but should have rung a bell with the authors when they got it. (The correct answer is 53.3, which can easily be verified.) This proves that using a hand calculator without thinking about what size the answer ought to be leads to embarassing errors. This actually is a very instructive example, but the conclusion that 27 years is the most appropriate time to harvest the forest has no supporting theory. At this frequency of errors, I expect to find more as I progress."
4,Good for what it is,"Compared to the Behringer AMP800, this thing is awesome. Compared to a Grace m902, it's a piece of garbage. That's how it goes with any product. It's built like a tank though, and well worth $129.It IS super-loud. I use it in my studio for the musicians during recording. Drummers LOVE this thing, compared to my other headphone sources, because they can really crank it to hear everything over the drums. Sometimes I cringe when I see where the volume knob is after a session. I can only turn it up to 8 or 9 o'clock without melting my brain!I haven't really used it as an audiophile heaphone amp, because I have other products for that, but as a HP amp for a few musicians to record some music, it works like a charm."
3,"great sound, 6 months power supply failure.","Sounded great loved it and then the power supply failed. good luck finding a 16 van 100 ma power supply anywhere. I ordered it from presonus and they have not shipped the power supply its been over a week. I can not test it to even see if it will work.The software support for my fire studio is awesome 2 years no problem. The hp4 is a good unit but the "" Made in China"" sticker makes me mad."
5,Great buy.,"This is just as promised, and easy to care for. You don't have to take special care of it."
5,Great Hat!,"I saw the reviews here and was hopeful but figured at this price it might be too good to be true but Surprise! This is a really nice hat at an shockingly low price and it might inspire me to buy more hats,I'm digging it...."
3,THE TRAVELING HAT,"Its a quality hat, good material .Pretty much as described , but if you are looking for the gangster fedora stylemake sure you get one with a "" high crown "" and stiffer construction."
4,A good starter for learning Albanian,"If you're looking for a way to pick up a few words and get started in a new language, Pimsleur can't be beat. Albanian is different enough from, say, Spanish, that it takes some work to pick up structures that come easier with Western European languages. Still, this is a good start and it's fun to have had your first conversation, however small, only an hour or so in. Though I did need to listen twice to disc 1 for my start.Warning: if you want to be fluent in Albanian, it's going to take more than this. But if you want to make a start and feel like learning Albanian might be possible, it's a good program and at a great price (comparable sets used to be around $100 for unusual languages). Supplement with Before You Know It's Albanian (byki.com) - the introductory lists are free and will give you a little more to do with what you've learned."
3,A little TOO basic!,A fair product for the price... this is only for very basic conversational Albanian. It does not provide you with an actual understanding of the langauge... If only Michel Thomas would do more languages!
2,Is not for beginners!,"I am just a beginner with the Albanian Language and this was way to confusing for me. I only looked at it once and decided that this was not for me! I think that it would be fine for more advanced people, but for beginners... No. Here is a link to a language learning thing that works much better for me: [...] Hope this helps!Jesus Bless your day!Jesus',Abigail"
3,good sound - when it sounds,Emeualtes the call very well. Unit has frozen on me and failed to sound in very cold weather. Not so good for those of us who hunt in Minnesota.
4,good for dead skin on your feet,I get really bad calluses on my heals and this works great to get the thick dead skin off. Becareful not to take too much off or it can be really sensitive for a while.
5,Visited the Hanoi Hilton this week while reading this book,"Very moving story. I was a child living on PAFB when Col Guarino returned home. My parents got to know him and received an autographed copy of his book. My Mom gave it to me to read on my recent trip to Hanoi, Vietnam. I was glad that I had this book with me. Seeing photos at the ""Hanoi Hilton"" of Col Guarino was very unsettling. My reaction overwhelmed me and I found it difficult to accept the Bac Ho propaganda splashed all over the city and the former POW prison. I was happy to have the truth from this book and sad that Vietnam has written a different history of the war."
2,Cheap Optics,"What can I say, you get what you pay for. The thought of extending my P712's already amazing 12X zoom by 2.2X for a total of 26X was very attractive at this price point. Unfortunately, the optics fall far short of superb. Chromatic aberations abound despite the ""HD"" coating, and the sharpness drops off towards anywhere near to a third from the edge of the image.I had a pair of plastic binoculars as a child. The optics on this unit performs similarly. The price point is the real seller here. But if you're interesting in taking sharp, high quality photos get the pricier, but infinitely superior Kodak telephoto for the P850/P712.To the seller's credit, they did include the lens adapter. I may find a use for this lens, but can not really recommend it."
4,"Product good, shipping slow",THe product worked fine. I only needed the track piece as the on in our closet had become bent over the years and was difficult for door to stay in place without falling out. I was able to take the old one down and pull new one up in just a couple minutes.Only issue was slow shipping. Product took nearly two weeks to receive. I did not have a damage problem another reviewer mentioned as mine was heavily wrapped in thick chipboard tube for shipping and survived UPS. Maybe they fixed that problem.
2,Difficult to Use,"While this product served the purpose we had for ordering it, it was difficult to install as the main piece that stretched along the top of the closet, was bent. My husband had to spend most of his time just straightening it out before he could attempt to install it. Better packaging would have been appreciated."
5,Arguably on of the best lounge CDs of 2003,"Visage is an impeccable and intimate mix of great music. It is the perfect CD to listen to while working, hosting, drinking, dining and yes, making love. An absolute gem that continually grows on one. Visage has a refreshing and welcoming feel to it. Hope there is a sequence to the first volume."
5,Great value,"Absolutely no break-in time! Comfortable,light and durable steel toe boot. I've owned Doc's for many years and this is the first industrial footwear I bought from them. They have not let me down!!"
1,"Doc Martens ""warranty"" is a joke","Don't be fooled by Doc Martens' claim of a ""lifetime warranty."" They have a policy of giving only a year to repalce boots, even in cases of clear manufacturer defects. It's shameful how they says ""docs are for life"" ... it really means you are STUCK with them for life.Docs used to be really good but they are made cheap now and are sure to fall apart long before they should!"
1,"Does Amazon sell ""rejects""? Poor workmanship & quality.","Not sure if merchandise Amazon gets is seconds or rejects, but my husband purchased his second pair of this style boots because the first was so good. We bought the first pair through his uniform company for $135. When he'd worn them out (1.5 years) I looked online and found them for $90 here and we ordered them.Out of the box they were fine, but after 2-3 months of wear the stitching was coming undone. Now, after only 7 months of wear, the soles have cracked at the ball of the foot on both boots.We checked the Doc Martin website and they say that you have to contact your retailer for a return. There is no information on the Amazon website for arranging such a return. We're outside the return window, and if we return them anyway, according to the return policy, we pay shipping PLUS lose 15-50% of the purchase price as a restocking fee. Hardly worth the trouble. Very disappointed in this sale."
1,Not a very good shoe,I ordered this shoe and wore them to work for a weekk I had to sens them back. I think there was an inherent design flaw. They were cutting into my ankles and causing sever pain. I could not wear them
5,"THIS IS A TYPE ""B"" FILTER","I JUST RECEIVED THIS ITEM AND IT IS A TYPE ""B"" FITLER FOR THE LARGER INTEX POOLS. NOT A TYPE ""A"". I HAVE A 18' X 48"" POOL AND THIS WAS THE RIGHT FILTER."
4,Better filtering than the smaller A cartridge....I'll admit.,"This seems to filter the fine sediment much better than the smaller ""A"" cartridge combined with the smaller 1500GPH pump. I purchased the 2500 intex pump as I was dissatisfied with the 1500 pump's performance. I have the larger 18' pool and it simply didn't do the job. Now I have learned to run the filter a few hours per day....if I use the pool or not. If you rinse the filter out every other day and you should be happy. Each filter last me a few weeks, at least....providing I keep it rinsed on a regular basis. Seller was very good, too....a smooth transaction."
5,The exact size we needed!,"We have an Intex 18 x 48 pool. The filters we need are size ""B"". This order was perfect! The size is perfect. Our local Wal-Mart (which didn't even have the size ""B"" until a couple of weeks ago) carries a much smaller size ""B"" filter and it won't work on our pool. The price we paid for these filters was cheaper than Wal-Mart and we are pleased. We will be ordering these again through Amazon!"
4,its a filter not a toy,works great and rinses great. what can i say? just It's cheaper than most i've seen and now I am gonna order a case!
4,"Good filter, but available at Wal-Mart.","This filter works great with the proper pump/filter combination. I was able to locate the exact same filter at Wal-Mart, which was cheaper since I didn't have to spend over $8 to have it shipped. Good filter."
5,Great Filters,These filters work great and can be rinsed a few times before having to use a new one. Buying them in bulk can also save a few dollars as opposed to purchasing them locally.
2,Crappy filter,"I bought this filter because I just needed a back up filter (for another not-so-great filter I bought). I wasn't going to buy an expensive one when we're nearing the end of swimming season.The only way this filter works well is if you take it out, clean it, and let it dry before reusing it. And it's only good for one filtering cycle. You have to have at least two of these in order to be able to filter your pool every day.I will definitely be going back to Pleatco next season."
4,Hard To Find,"[...].After replacing the filter, the unit was still giving me a ""low water flow"" message.It turned out that there were pine needles in the intake hose before the filter. After removing the pine needles everything worked right again.If my star review seems odd, it is because I was asked to rate a swimming pool filter as a toy."
4,As Expected,"The intex filter performed as expected. It must be changed every couple of weeks, so order enough to get you through the hot days of summer. Sometimes I do rinse them out or use a filter cleaner to extend their usefulness."
1,not what I ordered,"When I ordered this filter,I had clicked on a pack of 3 for 17.99 (plus an exorbitant shipping charge). I only did this because the Wal-Mart where I work did not have any. During the time I was waiting for the shipment, I found out that the Wal-Mart in Chippewa, PA had several packs of 2 on hand for $20. This was only 30 minutes from my home. When I received the package today, to my surprise there was only 1 filter in the box instead of three. I am keeping it because I am not spending the money to ship it back. I'm glad I made the trip to Wal-Mart to pick up the others. This was very misleading. I will not order from this website again."
1,Teach Yourself Polish Complete Course,THEY NEVER ARRIVED....I HAVE TRIED TO TRACK THEM DOWN THROUGH THE USPS.please help.... i need these tapes !!!!! PLEASE HELP.
1,Terrible AND a RipOff,"I bought this yesterday the local bookstore. The packaging on the outside reads ""Includes Two 60-minute CDs"". CD #1 contains 48 minutes of audio and CD #2 contains another 22 minutes. That comes out to 1 hour and 10 minutes...NOT the 2-hours proclaimed on the packaging! Very misleading.On top of that, this book/CD set jumps into the language as if you know some of it already. Little discussion/explaination of the nuances of the Polish language. It jumps into dialogue immediately with very fast speakers (instead of slowly exploring the pronunciation in depth) and I missed several consonant sounds. The alphabet was glossed over so quickly that I had to hit ""rewind"" on the CD player every 10 seconds. Bad investment. I'm taking it back and hope I can exchange it for a better program!"
3,Loud tape hiss on CDs,"Apparently, when coming out with the new edition, the publisher spent the money to redesign the graphics of the book, but transferred the taped material to CD, without going through the very simple step of cleaning up the audio. The result is CDs that contain loud, annoying tape hiss. What a stupid move."
2,Moves Way Too Fast !!!,"Moved way too fast for me. The first lesson starts out w/ the Polish alphabet and immediately jumps into pronunciations. The CD does not walk you through each lesson the way a CD-ROM does, it only gives the correct pronunciation of the words. You'll have to read the book closer to be able to follow. Even when they speak, they speak too fast to hear them. I had to keep backing up the CD and replaying it. If you are a beginner and catch on super quick, this may work for you. But if you need more detailed instruction and build things slowly in your mind as you understand them, this would not be your item. Not a bad item but too fast for my taste."
1,Terrible,"This was a terrible waste of money. My wife and I are moving to Poland in 6 months and wanted to begin learning Polish so that we can get around Warsaw without much help and to be able to communicate effectively. This CD and book set was practically useless for beginning language students. After 3 weeks with the CDs we are still on Lesson 1 and cannot understand half of what is said. The book as a great deal of information that is not even included on the CDs. No phonetic pronunciation guides are included in the book so new vocabulary that is introduced is a guessing game as to how you should pronounce it. A native Polish speaker that I know looked at the book yesterday and told me that there are incorrect sentences and slang introduced in the book as ""correct grammer"" and that we should not use this series to help us to transition to life in Poland. I would not recommend this set to anyone."
1,The worse rip off ever,DON'T ever buy this book.....I couldn't learn comfortably...there is more English in it than Polish....how fun wgen you have to replay 50 times!
3,"Decent book, but not for beginners",I am polish and understand it but dont have the best speaking and writing skills so i got this to try to learn more and improve. It doesnt explain the basics well and seems like it would be very difficult for someone learning polish for the first time. It has a lot of vocabulary and important subjects you need to know but if you really want to learn the language from not knowing anything i suggest Rosetta stone
1,Lacking originality,"There are a number of excellent and pioneering books on the brain. In my opinion, this is not one of them. If it is up to date, original, pioneering, and thought provoking material the reader is searching for, I would advise that they look elsewhere."
5,Awesome,"This was a great book!I coudln't make myself put it down because it was so fascinating, and I wanted to know what would happen next. It is a great fantasy series, with intriquing myths but great Christian morals"
5,Awesome book!,"I once thought that a certain wizard series was the best series ever, but even the best of those pale in comparison! I think that this has te makings of a classic! If I had a wish, I would wish I had never read this, just so I could read it for the first time again. I literally stay up until 3 to read these books. If you have any extra time, you should read these excellent faith-based books."
5,Raising Dragons- A MUST READ,"This book is the highlight of Brians work.It contains the epic battle between good and evil,and singles out the moral from the immoral.This is a fast paced read, and great for anyone who loves suspence;}."
2,Forgettable,"I read this series a few years ago when someone gave them to my kids. The kids seemed to enjoy them, but the books got under my skin. The author has this bad habit of throwing in a ten-dollar word or some overly flowery or complex construct in the middle of YA novel. A time or two I could forget, but it occurred with an irritating regularity. I got the impression that the author was trying to impress the adult reader with his vocabulary rather than to write a good story.The story line was typical YA and thus not too deep but appropriate for the genre."
1,painfuly disapointing,"thin plot... thin charicters... yuk.unbeliveable premis, but i could deal with that. however- the absoulte cornyness? no. you also may ask if this book is really christian. my answer? if everyone claiming to be one and yet never once asking for God's help is, then yes. but toward the end of the books, bryan davis even loses ""we strugle not against flesh and blood"" in that a few demons who come on the seen can be knocked down when a man jumps them from behind. and as i said above, God is never asked for help in this fight, nor is the name of Jesus envoked against these ""demons"". don't waste your time like i did in reading these. if you want some good christain fiction, try Karen Hancock (adult fic.) or C.S. Lewis. (Kathy Tyers writes some good christian sci. fic.)"
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed by a childish writing style. Even though it is intended for young adults, if you don't challenge them with a mostly adult writing style they are not going to advance. Most of all I was disappointed that it was stealth Christian Fiction. That should be prominently mentioned for those who are proud of it and for those who would not get anywhere near it. This book is not recommended."
5,You must read this book,"If you like fantasy, you'll love this book... and the whole series! Raising Dragons is a great start to an outstanding series!!"
5,In love with Dragons,"This book introduced me to a whole new world. The world of Dragons! This world has humans with draconic abilities, former dragons, and good vs. evil dragons. I've always wanted to fly so when I read this book I knew what I wished I was. A girl with dragon wings. A boy with extra hot breath, a girl with a huge backpack, and a strange principal can make any sort of possibilities. Bryan Davis has taken a possibility to the next level. This book and all the books after it will have you begging for more."
5,Awsome!!!,"This book is fantastic!!!! Bryan Davis is an incredible author who knows how to write a story. I can vouch that you will not be disappointed if you read this book. Make sure you have lots of time though, you won't want to put it down."
4,Captivating!,Although this book was written with young people in mind I enjoyed it immensely. The author created a captivating story filled with lots of suspense and mystery. His excellent character development and strong story line made me read far longer each night than my wife appreciated.I look forward to the next book and am sure it will be even better than the first. My four star ranking relates to my being a middle aged man. I think it's a five star book for youth readers.
4,An okay book,"This book was good for me because I am a beginner, but at some points the book was hard to read. I would definately recomend this book to someone who wanted information on scrying, or wanted to know how to select the best tools."
3,For believers only,"Scrying for Beginners is interesting, and fairly well written but definitely for beginners or for someone that might have a passing interest in knowing a bit more about Scrying, how it works..what to expect etc. It is ok for a first entry level into Scrying and explains enough about it that you could give it a try. The author covered a lot of ground and it is an easy read. The book is informative and even tells you how to make your own scrying mirror."
4,very informative read,"mr. tyson has written an excellent beginner's book on scrying. it is very informative both from a practical and historical perspective. the first half of the book is about the nature of scrying, and the preparations/rituals involved. the second half of the book is about the various ways of scrying: water scrying, oil scrying, crystal, mirror, lamp scrying; pendulum uses, ouija boards and so on. the book is easy to read and well-written. my only complaint and it is a very minor one, is there is no ""concluding"" or ""ending"" chapter to wrap everything up with. the book just ends after mr. tyson talks about ""dream scrying"". i was wanting more, or at least have him draw a conclusion to what he all wrote. anyway, all in all a highly recommended read if you're interested in scrying."
3,Intro to scrying,"This book has much to recommend it, but bogs down in a lot of material that is both peripheral to the subject and conjectural in nature. The basic techniques are interesting and of some worth, as are the historical parts and the information about constructing the devices for scrying. The author also has good insight into the psychology of this practice which is worthy. Where the book falls down is in the attributions to the value of such things as moonlight etc., all of which are not germane to the actual practice, but, I'm afraid, fodder for people who want fantasy as an addendum to this subject."
2,do i really need it ?,I bought this product thinking of an air conditioned for the cpu. Results:1.- Frequently stops due to overheating. Cause: air bubbles2.- The cpu fan works even better than the cooler.3.- Nice toy but useless
2,Nice try,"Given what we now know about the nature of the Soviet threat that we did not know when this book was written it is easy to see how Mr. Hiss could have attracted a following of sympathizers to his claims of injustice. This book is well written but, in light of now-available KGB documents and Venona intercepts, Mr. Hiss's ""Woe is me!"" tale of conspiracy and ""forgery by typewriter"" ring pretty hollow when compared to the woe that was visited upon millions of innocents who lived their entire lives never knowing the freedom that their heirs now enjoy in a free, democratic Europe. Mr. Hiss and those who shared his world view must bear in eternity the guilt recompense an individual who would enslave a continent."
4,good i guess,"i like the fact that its fade resistant and i know that its made out of carpet because i don't know what valuer is.however finding a product for my 1999 dodge was to hard using what amzon had and the company's list of models that the dash board cover was for, so i found this one for a 1997 base model and it fits but has one are where its two big for my truck plus the picture is not like what i received this the one in the pic would probably have fit better"
5,"An austere beauty, a wonder of clarity and concison","This text belongs with 'Analysis, Manifolds and Physics' by Choquet-Bruhat et al. and other contemporary classics in mathematical physics. Ryder's 'Quantum Field Theory' and the books by Nash and Sen would also make the list -- texts which take one into the heart of the matter in a lucid, logical progression through the essential ideas."
2,NOTHING NEW,THIS BOOK IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE MANY PUBLICATIONS IN THIS SUBJECT MATTER THAT MISSES THE WHOLE POINT.
3,expected more,I want to finish this book but it might not hold my interest enough to continue reading it. There are too many unimportant details to get me distracted and confused to follow the story.
5,great resource,"I got this to help in my class on Plautus (reading the Amphitruo and Casina) and it has become my constant companion. Plautus is full of colloquial Latin which can be difficult to understand, and the Loeb gives a fantastic translation. Also it is great for the part in the Amphitruo's prologue when Mercury uses legal speak, which is probably the toughest section of the entire play."
4,Some Skunk Funk CD mostly Funky,"Great CD, especially since Randy Brecker died this week. The CD arrived in perfectly new condition. However, because of the way it was recorded, it would not play on one of our CD players. It played in the cars and on the family stereo, but not in our DVD/CD player."
1,So sad to say that this is the bosstones!,Im sorry but the bosstones dont do it for the music anymore. This whole album sounds like a big try to get into the mainstream and just make money. The songs lack feeling and i was glad when the CD ended...
2,"Not Quite As Good As ""Let's Face It""","I guess I came into this record thinking that it would be ever better then ""Let's Face It"". But the fact of the matter is if your buying this record cause you love upbeat ska you may want to get one of their previous albums because the fact of the matter is that this album is much more mellow. If you like happy ska check out The Hippos and Five Iron Frenzy or maybe ya wanna stick with the Bosstones and get a previous record. I have set forth my opinion, the choice is your's."
2,Nothing new,"With the exception of the song ""so sad to say"" (which is a real good song I must say) this CD brings back old material from the earlier years. Nothing spectacular here."
4,"Audrey, you are a dork","Not as poppy or catchy as their older stuff, but definitely better thought out. It's great that the band tried a few new things. A few tracks could have been b-sides. A slightly shorter tracklist would have made it an easier listen."
5,BEST FREAKING CD!,"if the stars would go highter it'd be 14. as a fan of the bosstones i would love this cd anyway. but i was really amazed at how the songs were just a bit more then what i expected. most of them songs stick to you. when i get bored at work allofasudden ""the skeleton song"" would pop in my head and i'd start humming to it. well, i reakon that would happen to anybody but face it,..... when has a song poped up in yer head that you LIKE? it's farly new, but if you want to find out who the bosstones are get this cd. and i hate those people who say ""oo it's too long"" shut the ... up and listin to the dern cd. you know you like it. (by the way my favorite song is temporary trip)"
3,i never knew,"i didn't even buy this cd for myself, it was sent to me by one of those dumb cd club thingys. i was going to send it back, but being a ska fan, i decided to give it a chance. it took 3 times throught the cd to finally catch on. after hearing it a couple times i must say that i actually enjoy this cd much more than i thought i would. The cd starts out strong....i absolutely love ""Let Me Be"", but then it gets a little drag in the middle and then kicks up at the end. overall, if you're looking for a cd to play in the background while you're cleaning your room, this one does the job."
2,It really is so sad to say,"I've been a Bosstones fan for a long time now, so it pains me to say that this is not their best album. I guess I was looking for more of throwback album like MNAOD, but ""Pay Attention"" is not it. I'm genuinely happy for the hometown boys done good, but it's time the Bosstones get back to their roots. This will be even more difficult without the amazing Nate Albert on guitar. Sadly, I couldn't agree more with Dicky, ""It's so sad to say, What we had has gone away."""
3,Just ignored for those fools in N' Stink,"This album was the long awaited follow-up to the hugely succesful Let's Face It. Let's Face It(pardon the pun), went Multi-Platinum and these guys were on the verge of being superstars after years of underground success. However, when The Bosstones released Pay Attention in April, 2000, the album was ignored. The public nicknamed this album Just Ignore because of those maggots N' Sync had that stupid Bye Bye Bye CD out at the same time. Of course, the sheep followed what big brother MTV said was musically great but The Bosstones whom were one of the originators of the ska-rock thing were wrongfully relegated to one-hit wonder land. This is a good CD buy it."
5,Bosstones Rule,i can actually listen to this cd all the way through and not skip songs. for me that is amazing. the bosstones are great i've never liked ska before them and now i do. this cd brought me into a whole new music genre. its listenable and has great music talent behind it.
5,More ska from the kings,"Wow!! I thought they would't be able to top ""Let's Face It""...but they did. A great album with several tracks destined for singles and chart toppers. Great lyrics and instrumentals but I don't expect any less. These guys from Boston really know how to make 'em. This CD will definately go into my fave section."
4,Much better but still lagging in some places,"I have been a mediocre Bosstones fan for a few years. I have not yet had the privelge of seeing them live but have listened to most of their CDs.""Let's Face It"" was a great CD. Many of the songs in there were wonderfully put together and many had good messages behind the great instrumentation.""Pay attention"" has increased my perception of the artistic abilities of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Their saxophonist is incredible, their horns are dynamic, and rich sounding, and the songs are great to listen to.However, in ""Pay attention"" It seems like there is a lot of filler material. Some of the later songs in the CD seem poorly written or put together. It is a far cry from ""Skeleton Song"" and ""So sad to Say"" which are now in my opinion, the two best songs the Bosstones have ever done."
4,An Ok CD,"This seems kind of blah. Nothing really is attention getting as some of the other stuff I listen to, it's a little slower than Reel Big Fish, and Less Than Jake and sometimes the guy can't be understood. I do enjoy listening to it, but since I'm not a big Bosstones fan, I wouldn't recommend except for Bosstones fans."
3,PAY ATTENTION (as if we had a choice),"Combining words to live by with catchy melodies seems to be the M.O. of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Songs of warning and reproach abound, often sucking the listener in with tunes you can hum, until the listener surrenders to that melody and tries to ignore the incessant preaching. Lessons to be learned: Honesty is really important (""The Skeleton Song"" uses the word honest/honestly more times than I cared to count.), but not if you were in the Vietnam War (""All Things Considered"") there are ""One Million Reasons"" for a break up, but you don't have to list them. And so on. I like this band and I enjoy the fact that they are not afraid to make their songs be about more than your average rocker, but sometimes they need to lighten up on the life lessons; it gets to be a bit much."
4,"Same Church, Different Pew","While I absolutely enjoy the music of Alejandro Escovedo, this CD is much the same as his previous releases, only with a different musician line up. Don't get me wrong, it is a great representation of him in concert along with his string quintet. I saw him in Milwaukee with this current quintet and it was a night that I won't soon forget due to his show. I'll simply never tire of his music. If you have been following this amazing artist for a while, you would be set if you owned Gravity. However, if you are new to this man's music, filled with raw emotions bleeding in the lyrics, then this CD is a definite must. I am looking forward to his new material that I have heard is coming out sometime soon through Back Porch Records. Good to have a healthy Alejandro back!"
4,Still working perfectly after 4 years!,"Worked first time, every time.Easy to use, program.Rock solid, no complaints!"
2,I miss popcorn too...,"I've had this product for just a few days and so far the convection features work well. However, the microwave is sub-par. For example, it takes twice as long to pop microwave popcorn as my old $30 Emerson microwave. The result is that the popcorn burns more than it pops. In general, the microwave seems underpowered. This is a pity because the *combined* microwave/convection functionality is precisely why someone would buy this product, and why I give it only a 2-star rating. The poor microwave performance raises questions about Sharp's quality control standards, in general. Finally, it's also difficult to discern which auto-settings utilize microwave vs. convection heating, and thus difficult to know what materials (e.g., foil vs. paper) are safe as a cover for the dish being prepared."
2,save your money,only lasted for a year and a half and wouldn't grill a steak like the previous 2 sharp micro convection would that I owned...this one was like baking meat not grilling...it would do chicken or any meat that took a hour or so to cook OK but failed miserably on anything thin or needed high heat to brown quickly...look elsewhere because this model sucks
1,Sharp R-820JS convection microwave,"It only worked for a week then died while heating water. Been in the shop getting fixed now for about 3 weeks, waiting for 2 parts. I have used Sharp convection microwaves in the past and was expecting the same excellent quality. What a disappointment. Don't buy this oven. Continue searching."
3,Versatile oven but...,I got this oven last year and it has served us well overall. My biggest problem with this oven is that it has started to rust from inside. I clean the oven regularly for food splatters but the rust is developing from the steam from food.I am disappointed with the quality!
3,Should be better...,"While the item offers plenty of bells and whistles and the option of convection cooking, it does only a fair job of the microwaving. Often it seems that the device does not sufficiently heat an item despite following the recommended time on the package. After experience with other microwaves it became clear that the microwave does a poor job of heating items that are low on the carousel."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"Having had this Sharp Microwave-Convection oven and it finally after years of use, broke down, knew I wanted to replace it with the same model, couldn't find one locally, so off to Amazon site I went, and there it was, great price, free shipping and once again, I am enjoying this Sharp Microwave-Convection combo oven. If you have need of such an item or your space it limited, don't hesitate to purchase this oven.Thanks Amazon!"
4,A OVEN FOR EVERYTHING,"I have purchased this over for over 4 years. Works amazingly especially for all the days when you don't want to turn on that big oven just to toast/bake/grill some food. Best machine invented! I've researched for a long time for a product like this. All my three teenagers have no problems baking a frozen pizza. Makes life easier! Highly recommended. Only negative: Doesn't make good popcorn. Other than that, great investment. You will use it everyday for anything..."
4,Stylish and easy to use,Great product. It looks good and does everything everyone says. Haven't baked in it but I have grilled and nuked. Works well.
4,Good product but no way to register,Sharp has a terrible web site. The window for registering the product comes up blank. Filled out a form to let Sharp know and the submit button doesn't work. Called their 800 number and the person didn't know what to do and after being on hold the second time I just hung up.
1,Did not work well & Began Arcing,"The oven appeared to be well made with many neat features, but it never worked as well as an inexpensive 11 year old Sears model it replaced. We returned it when it began arcing under the turntable, actually beginning to burn the driveshaft for the turntable. Amazon returns has made it painless - print out the return label, re-package & drop off at UPS. Hope the refund process works as well!"
5,best microwave ever!,"I got this for a present 5 years ago. It's still going strong and I'm still finding out new things I can do with it. I have baked bundt cakes, pies and biscuits. I made small roasts and grilled hamburgers. I defrost, reheat, and cook frozen foods. I love it."
3,"Works Well, But Doesn't Last Long","3 years old and the LED panel stopped working. This seems to be a recurring issue with this microwave/convection oven. It still works, but you have to guess what you are doing since the LED screen is blank. Numerous folks with this issue about the 2-3 year mark."
5,FANTASTIC !,This is the greatest cooking tool you could have in any Kitchen. It does require some common sense cooking skills as well as Microwave skills but when you master the Convection as well as the new Microwave technology and then combine the two together it is just AWESOME! ..I love this Oven!
4,my third Sharp Convection,"I looked long and hard trying to find a convection oven with all the settings my previous ovens had and I am very happy with my purchase.I do most of my cooking with this as it saves me time and uses very little energy compared to my electric oven. I highly recommend it to anyone.I don't know why anyone would buy a convection toaster oven! If I want to make toast, I use a toaster!!"
4,The Powerful and the Nice,"This machine is nearly 1.5 to 2 minutes faster in cooking things than was our old, not so old, microwave (we have it in the staff kitchen of our nonprofit social services agency). The user's guide is not well written and can be very confusing at times, but employing common sense helps to overcome the poor skills of the manual writer. By remembering that it's easy to use, you can then make sense of the step by step ladder to confusion. Nevertheless, the capabilities of this machine are appreciated by us all."
4,no need for an oven anymore,"This oven works great, you can microwave anything and reheat or cook with convection. There isnt a need for an oven if you are only one or two people.I think this is a great oven and I would recommend it ."
4,Sharp R-820JS,"This is a very good product. The microwave has plenty of power, and many shortcuts in programming.I like the convection oven for small roasts.If you are looking for a microwave/convection oven I recommend this one!"
3,Sharp R-820JS Convection Microwave Oven,Overall this unit works well. The mechanism that support and rotate the carousel while it is cooking could be design better to improvement balancing the carousel when food is placed on it.
5,Good little oven,"Sharp makes a pretty good little convection-microwave oven. The first developed a small electrical problem. After one repair, $75, we replaced it with this from the amazon.com site.Competitively priced, speedily delivered, exactly as ordered."
2,2nd attempt,"Seems like Amazon didnt like my initial review (nothing offensive), and they deleted it after 2 days keeping intact all the other positive reviews. Not even an email indicating why it was removed.Guess they are changing their practices after all.And there is no way to retrieve it either.Im not going to waste my time as last time, but a quick summary:Pros: Looks good, thats itCons: too much depth, too slow, lousy toaster (main reason for purchasing it..for a small home)...too many buttons to press for a simple operation, and if u make a mistake, start all over again, lousy lcd display, cannot view from top or side.Now lets see if they remove this review !"
2,"Looks chintzy, stainless steel only on the interior","I have no opinion on how this cooks because I never turned it on. Opened the box and saw that 1) the front of the microwave was cheap-looking silver plastic, and 2) only the interior is actually stainless steel and so it didn't match anything in my kitchen. Sealed it up and sent it back to Amazon. If you read the description right you'll see they disclose it's only the interior that's stainless, but definitely not what I was expecting for the price."
1,Caught on fire! Horrible warranty experience!,"The microwave itself worked great for almost a year, but when I called Sharp warranty service to get it replaced after it caught on fire and started billowing smoke, they told me I had to either bring it to an authorized service repair center 5 miles away (I live in Manhattan and use public transportation, so this is not just slightly inconvenient, it's inconceivable). Find a microwave that isn't a safety hazard."
1,Insufficient information given--cannot install over heat element.,"I had to rate this item with one star because I was unable to use the product. There is no way I can express the functionality of the Sharp R-820JS microwave/convection oven, because I could not install it. If I had been told that it could not be installed over a heat source, I would not have purchased it. No where in the description of the oven was this noted. In all of the 35 reviews, no one said anything about not installing it over a range. I found out that it could not be installed over a heat source when I read the manual. That was too late! I had already purchased the unit, and it was delivered. Perhaps this has happened to other people, but they have not written of their disappointment of not being able to use this product, due to the negative feature of this Sharp oven. Hopefully, this will prevent others from getting it and having to return it."
1,No formatting for bad poetry,"As if the title of this review doesn't cover the problems with this edition, it doesn't have proper formatting so the poetry reads like prose...really bad prose.If you can get past the formatting issue, the content of the poems is lacking. Self-indulgent pap is the closest I can get to explaining Adams' style. I suppose it's worth the price I paid (nothing)...barely."
1,Worst thing to ever spend money on!,"My Dad purchased this item for my daughter. While on a road trip this weekend we noticed a strong smell. It was this DVD player! It is now totally warped and burned inside and out. Save your money; what a disappoinment! And, as other readers said, their is no customer service- the website no longer exists and the phone number is disconnected."
1,L-E-M-O-N,"I bought this during Black Friday at ToysRUs. After only 6 months, the battery died so it wasn't exactly ""portable"" anymore and you can't get a replacement battery. The company is a no-name company that's impossible to contact. The LCD screen flickers on & off. Like other reviews have mentioned, the sound is awful. Junked it and got a Magnavox for the same price."
1,Horrible,I bought one of these and it worked well for about a month(if that). Now I can't use it because everytime it has lines across the screen and it stops working. A piece of junk! Save your money!
4,very good,this product works great. does all its tasks. and the provider delivers on time... which i think is important in my field.
1,Did anyone read the nutritional info first before buying this product?,"I didnt, but here are the facts now.980mg of sodium in each bouillon cube. That makes 40% of your DV.High sodium content in each cube. Unless you have low BP. This one is a real killer beware. I bought mine at local store, but then I didnt not read the nutri info until I got it home. The whole thing goes to trash."
5,Not low doium,"My husband was in the hospital and they served this both. He loved it, He was suppose to be on low sodium, of what the HELL, if it is good good for the gusto. Thanks"
1,This Vegetable Bouillon is NOT Vegan,This vegetable bouillon is NOT vegan.It contains WHEY and LACTIC acid.
5,DMX At His Best!!!,"Ok when I give a cd a rating and I give the album a 5 doesn't mean that each album I give a 5 to is on the same level. I just wanted to get that striaght. Now to the album.This album is a must have classic!!! This is Dark Man X at his best. He's ""Great Depression"" album is just not cutting it so I just pop in this CD to remind me of the ol' DMX I know and......and know dang it.Overall this album has good tracks and I didn't have to skip through any tracks to listen to another one so that is a plus. The lyrics and the production goes really well and the replay value is really good. You have to get this one! Peace!"
4,"good, but not amazing","i find it hard to write reviews about music. i love all music. this cd is very good, and has given me hours of entertainment. it isn't however, as good as some. if you are a hardcore rap fan, and are looking for another cd to add to your collection than buy this album. if you're a biginner and just want a really good rap cd to listen to, buy something else."
4,stop the hating,"first i would like to say that anyone who hates on this album does not know the meaning of hip hop or rap...... you have to listen to what x is sayin and not just listen for words to ryhme or hear some type of beat that u can bop too all his music is hot if u stop to listen to the messages and really feel him u will see that this album is tight dmx takes rap to a whole new level and people that want to hate and say that he ia garbage dont even understand what he is sayin or where he is tryin to take it to mainly cause they are on a whole different lower level than x, me and everyone else but hes still my man"
4,a really good cd,"DMX has always been one of my favorites i love all of his albums expecially this one. He has feeling in his songs and it hits you right at home. He's close to god even when he's out there making a living. He cares about his fans and gives them exactly what we give him, love........"
2,what is all the fuss about?,"two words, TRY AGAIN... this cd is not what i was expecting... i was expecting another bomb cd like the last one, but DMX, must have gathered the left over beats from RUFF RYDERS VOL 1, and EVE's CD, cuz this is trash."
1,THIS IS NOT HIP HOP!,its pop you might as well go & play with your dog than listen to dmx bark! buy still i rise! this cd is garbage on tupacs new cd there is a song with dmx and its the best dmx song ever!
5,DMX DOES IT AGAIN,DMX delivers an incredible sound. This album is an instant classic and any fan should have it. This CD has an energetic and powerful mood and can get anybody pumped. 5 stars all they way!!!!
5,Party Up,Yet Another Classic From The Dog. His most succesful album to date and not for nothing since it contains some serious hot records along with club bangers.Top 51. Party Up (Classic)2. One More Road To Cross3. Here We Go Again4. What These B***** Want5. The Professional
3,I AM JUST A BANDWAGON JUMPER,"I am a bandwagon jumper so i have questions a bout this cd. two weeks ago i decided to start listening rap music, because i started snowboarding cause it's cool. When I heard dmx i am like man, thats rad man. the people I was following around were listenig to him so i started listening. but now nobody likes him so i am stuck in a jam, cause i bought the cd. i love listening to him in the dark so i can dance with pantys on. the back grounds are cool. his words are sort of rad but he swears and thats cool also. its the best when he raps while background music is on. but none of my chums listen so i am going to give him a maybe. i decided to become a rapper also but, i am going to have shallow words. take these new words from my good song. i am a rough rider man riding rough is fun when i ride rougher then you. dmx is cool because he wears cool pants and hats."
3,"As the third approaches, the music begins to fade","I had high hopes for this X album. After GREAT debut with his first, I began to see greatness of the ""tupac-esque"" caliber. This third album from X, although having some god cuts, seems to fizzle when compared to his first and maybe even his second album. I agree that overall, it is more of the same. Though that may be good for some, it leaves me with the same ol taste in my mouth/ we want something new! Though not GREAT, it still deserves 3 out of 5 for at least being a bit of the ol good stuff."
1,not great,DMX IS KILLING TUPAC ON THE BILLBOARD CHARTS I DON'T SEE HOW THIS CAN BE DMX'S ALBUMS JUST KEEP GETTING WORSE! HE GOES FROM BARKING LIKE A DOG TO SHOUTING LIKE A CAT
5,the best rap,"Its the best cd with all good songs, u can listion to the hole cd with out jumping track to track. he has kept his old school rap.This is the best cd of all his cd's."
2,get tupac instead,"yo on the real, x's new album is beter than the one before, but both were wack. the first one was tight, but then he fell off. i would recommend all of u to get the new 2pac cd. its one of the best to drop in 99....peace out."
1,More Predictible Drivel From The X Man,"Once again, DMX releases another album full of his anger and frustration. Yes, many of you Ruff Ryder fans are impressed that he has put out three albums in two years, and that his artistic integrity frees him to say exactly what's on his (limited) mind. But one day you'll tire of his song and dance--""I'm angry, I have pain, I'll murder you, I screw pretty women"". Give me more. Expand your boundaries--or lose them entirely, if you can. His music is cathartic, I'll allow that. Losing yourself in it is a good outlet--screaming along with his words gives you a false sense of connection with a famous man. But the anger he sells you is contrived. He has his image and he'll stick with it. Fans slurp it up like hot soup....Every time I hear ""new single by DMX"", I know I'm not going to hear anything new. I know I won't be inspired or impressed. And I know that won't change anytime soon."
2,"Don't even waste your money, the radio plays DMX nonstop....","Sheesh. If I wanted to hear barking and growling on my music, i'd stick a microphone in front of my Rottweiler Petey. And it'd be a lot more entertaining.I'm already sick of this CD thanks to radio overkill. Just hearing the tracks on this nonsense make me reach for my Tribe or Wu albums."
2,Falling point,This is the album where x man showed his weakness/commercialism. He was slightly commercial on the prior realeases but hit the epitome of it on this album. It shows when he did the song with the kat from dru hill. DMX released the prior two albums so quick and they were hot. Then he ran out of things to say and the albums sounded the same but even more commercial. I gave up on full albums with X starting with this album and only deal with him on a song by song basis.
1,one of the worst cd's i've ever taken the time to listen to,"yikes. DMX has completely fallen off the wagon. I don't know what happened, but ever since Ruff Ryders Anthem it has just been all going straight downhill. I figure that DMX realized that by making simple music for simple people he could triple his fan base. I remember a couple years back when Get At Me and Stop Being Greedy first came out. D got no love at all.... I actually liked the cut w/ Regina Bell on it, I almost bought the album for that one. After hearing that y'all gone make me lose my mind garbage i quickly scrapped that idea. I got to hear it at a friends house about two days later. MAN was I glad that I didn't waste [money] on it! I'd have to say that each of his albums has been 1/2 as good as it's predecessor. Flesh of My Flesh was good at best, while Then There Was X is [really awful]. DO NOT buy this album unless you are ... in search of simple music w/ simple unintelligent lyrics."
1,Get Real People,"Wow another lame rap Cd with nothing to give but a guy shouting about stuff that no one really cares about....well only the people who like this stuff. Let me think....DMX....yawn.It's been done, nothing original, nothing special and really nothing anything different from any other rap artist these days.No my words are not out of hate or anger or discrimination or lies.....it's just the facts.DMX ~ 0 stars out of 10 stars"
1,don't buy this,"DMX is corny...He has no talent nor skill and the only thing worse than him is his bandwagon of illiterate and ignorant ""fans""."
1,DoNt BuY ThIs cD,THIS CD IS WAACCKK MARY POPPINS RHYMES BETTER THAN DMX YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY BUYING THIS ONE! BUY STILL I RISE! ITS BETTER THAN THIS CD ITS BETTER THAN THIS CD ITS BETTER THAN THIS CD ITS BETTTTTER THAN THIS CD I CALL MY LAWYER HES SUCH A GOOD LAWYER THAT BY TOMMOROW MORNING YOU GON BE WORKIN IN ALASKA! SO DRESS WARM!
3,X's worst offering,"I used to be a huge DMX fan untill i picked this up when it came out. Since then I've regained a little of my faith in X with The Great Depression being a superior album. The only real bangers on the album are whats my name, one more road to cross, and here we go again, so if you want vintage X, pick up one of his other three albums."
3,What happened here?,"What the hell happened here? DMX used to be cool but this record was really lacking. What is with all the praying and new-found religiousness of his? The absolutely worst song on this whole cd is Party Up, the chorus is the VERY BAD mixture of a hardcore rap artist and a teeny-bopper. The whistles really irritate me too, definately not recommended cranking up this track. The whole song is ""clean"" aswell, making it pretty boring. There are some interesting tracks like ""The Professional"" which I enjoyed, but mostly this CD was a dud. Get it if you are a fan only."
1,i can't give it 0 stars,"The only reason i gave this cd 1 star was because i couldn't give it 0 stars, believe me i would have. This album is no better than horrible. The lyricts don't flow don't make sense and they have no meaning. I don't like mainstream but if you do there are still many so called mc's that are better than ""x"". Oh yeah and the beats aren't even good on the whole, this cd gets no props."
2,ummmmm... not so good,"I am a DMX fan, but I want to be honest with you. This is only an ok recording. The whole way through it sounds like it was rushed through production. It just doesn't sound complete. It also has to much of a pop, mainstream feel. I mean I think it was meant to click with the TRL fans or something. I think DMX is just trying to ride out his success with less than average music.If you are a DMX fan, I would suggest this cd because its got his famous style. If your not a real big DMX fan I would suggest that you get the new 2pac instead if your looking for some good rap music."
4,I wouldn't expect anything less!,DMX is still the rawest dog in the game. The CD is on point. The lyrics that he spits is off the hook. The first one is still the best but this one is definitely a close second...
1,say wha?,"YO, i dont know if u cats out here in the world know good hiphop when u hear it. I can truly say that this cd isnt worth buying. ""Great songwriter"" please....... my girl can write better hiphop songs than this and she doesnt even dig rap like that. To just be plain out honest, i dont see any skill in barks, and hollering obscene gestures, and talkin and rambling about nothing. I'll be smiling when people stop listening to DMX's commercial-rap. wake up y'all..."
2,OVERRATED RAPPER,"WUZ UP PEEPS, DMX ALONG WITH,I WANT SAY NO NAME(JZ)IS OVERRATED RAPPERS. HIS NEW ALBUM IS GARBAGE,HE IS A GOOD RAPPER BUT I WON'T PUT HIM UP THERE WITH (PAC,BIG,SCARFACE). ONLY GOOD SONG IS ""WHATS MY NAME"". I THINK THE PRODUCTION IS WEAK AS HELL, SWIZZ BEAT IS RUNNING OUT OF GOOD BEATS. DMX PUT OUT 3 ALBUMS AND THEY HAVE JUST BEEN GETTING WORST. IT'S NOT A QUALITY ALBUM, HE""S JUST DROPING ALBUMS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE""S HOT RIGHT NOW. YOU""LL NEED 2 SUPPORT THAT NEW PAC AND THE OUTLAWZ. ONE LUV"
1,What's the deal?,"Hey, I know I can't tell you people who to like, but I don't understand what people are thinking when they call DMX a great lyricist. He's not all that great at writing anything deep, it's just rhymes to sell records. Just my opinion though."
4,DMX - ...And Then There Was X,"After dropping two multiplatinum albums in 1998, DMX returns to the scene in 1999 dropping his third solo album, ""...And Then There Was X.""1. The Kennel (Skit) - Intro2. One More Road to Cross - 4.5/53. The Professional - 4/54. Fame - 5/55. Alot to Learn (Skit)6. Here We Go Again - 4/57. Party Up (Up in Here) - 5/58. Make a Move - 4.5/59. What These B****** Want (Featuring Sisqo) - 3/510. What's My Name - 4.5/511. More 2 a Song - 4/512. Don't You Ever - 4.5/513. The Shakedown (Skit)14. D-X-L (Hard White) (Featuring The L.O.X. & Drag-On) - 3.5/515. Comin' for Ya - 3.5/516. Prayer III - Skit17. Angel (Featuring Regina Bell) - 4.5/518. Good Girls, Bad Guys [Bonus Track] (Featuring Dyme) - 4/5Overall:59/704 StarsDMX comes hard on this album. There's no doubt he isn't one of the hardest to ever grace the mic. Some of his hooks lacked and I wasn't feeling a couple of the beats, but besides that this album is great."
3,Other side of X,"DMX is the only artist that can take the a terrible beat (usually a Swiss-Beat) and still make a good song. That's because of the honesty in his lyrics nad the ominous sound of his voice. Face it, the vioce is tight. Plus, he has pesonality to boot. Ocassionally, this album sounds like one long, repetitive song (except for the tight cuts the Professional, Fame, What's My name, and Angel) but DMX can keep yuo intersted. While most rappers pretend that they do no wrong, X readilly admits that he often crosses that fine kine between good and evil. X is the realest rapper out. Period. Even if you don't like all of the ""gangsta"" posing and DMX language on the album, you will definatley look at life and rappers in a new way."
4,Keeps putting it down.,"Dmx's energy gets higher and higher every album and on his latest he shows he is still at the top of his game. A change in this album shows that DMX can go from preaching to God or cursing out his rivals or even doing a rap duet in the song bad boys , good girls. If you have ever liked the sound of DMX you will like this album."
2,The bad side of dmx,I think that tha first 2 dmx albums was tight but he came out sorry on this one. His lyrics are still there but its not tha crunked up dmx we used to here. Tha production is sorry. it only got 2 or 3 joints on it. I thought swiss beats was tighter than dat. I wouldn't suggest buying it unless you are into just lyrics our you are a dmx fanatic and then it would be tha same dmx you use to hear.
3,Is really falling off,unimpressed begining of his fall off but not as bad as his next two the fire has burned out of this man after party up has shown signs of fire on x gon give it to ya and get it on the floor wit swizz beatz but the fire is gone sorta like sticky fingaz and x is leaving the game but not on a jayz note6.5 of 10 lyrics 8 of 10 beats
2,Kind of Ho Hum,"i was really disappointed when i got this album. it's fairly repetitive both vocally and musically. dmx can do a lot better then this, it just seems more confirmation that the rap world is in serious trouble right now. someone needs to come along and shake the genre up. i won't spend time talking about all the things i disliked about this album, instead i'll just mention that i listened to it for the first two days i owned it and i haven't touched in in the four months since then."
1,"hez gonna make uz looz our mind,hell wit thiz,hell wit thiz.","if ya all think thiz cd iz tha bom,hell wit ya 2. hez gonna make uz looz our mindz,hell wit thiz, hell wit thiz.thiz cd iz by far tha worst ov all 3 dmx'z cdz.if ya a dmx fan go buy ITZ DARK AND HELL IZ HOT.don't buy thiz cd,only if ya want 2 lisen 2 tha notorios D.O.G. bark.if ya want a good cd get tha new 2pac+outlawz,still i rize,cd."
1,This album falls below expectation,"I thought this album would be much better! I was wrong! what i got was boring hooks and tiresome beats! I bought the new tupac and outlawz album ""still i rise"" and i was very pleased. You should buy ""still i rise"""
3,Average,"this cd is so average dmx's cds have gone down in quality each cd i guess acting gets in his way but still i miss the dmx who recorded slippin that song was so hard i wish those days would come back like r.kellyFavorite Track:Party UpGuests:Drag-On,Lox,Swizz Beatz6.5 of 10 lyrics 7.5 of 10 beats"
2,same type of stuff,This Album is very much the same as his previous two. Alot of the gimmick dog bark is all over this c.d. I would suggest Still i rise by Tupac.
5,One of the best albums of '99,"I was highly anticipating this release from X, and he did not disappoint! This is another hot album and proves that DMX is one of the most talented and inspired lyrical poets of hip hop today. How many other artists break out and release 3 albums in 2 years? He's got a gift that other artists could only wish for. If you've heard and liked DMX's other albums you won't be disappointed by this one. All the songs are tight. The bonus track ""Good Girls, Bad Guys"" at the end is HOT! Just when you think the album is over that song comes on and proves to be one of the best on the whole CD. I highly recommend this album!"
2,OK BUT NOT TO HIS POTENTIAL,"I think that this album was ok but if you look at all his other music including belly soundtrack and his first two albumz this was nuthin the beats were wack compared to everything else and the lyrics were ok but not good enough if you really want a good X album go for ""ITS DARK HELL IS HOT or ""FLESH OF MY FLESH BLOOD OF MY BLOOD"" those are very good i got em both"
1,dee em eks iz tha bust wraper evor.,i given thiz see dea 1 stur cuz i iz thinking thut dee em eks is numbor wun.he is better than yanni and butney spheerz. it is good for listen in but if sit on ut for long time it break and stink not good. i hoope thut my reevuw make you spend lotta muney on a see dea tha by dee em eks calle d und than tare wuz ecks.bye. idont no you but me luv u any hoo
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,Don't waste your money on this commercial rap garbage! buy still i rise by 2pac & the outlawz
2,Not even worth the time...,"I write this review as a fan of rap, so I can't bring myself to give this album more than two stars. Those two stars, by the way, are for the beats on the album. Nothing that Earl does is worth listening to if you're looking at the lyrics. He uses every rap cliche in the book, so I just can't feel any of his songs. On this album, he comes with rhymes my 8 year old brother could top, and he don't even like rap yet! For all the people claiming that DMX has the best album ever, did you actually listen to the lyrics on this album? They're horrible! So again, if you're going to give this album 5 stars, back up your review with some lyrics of his that are actually tight. Until you do, I can't help but say that the entire album isn't worth getting, even if it's free."
2,DMX is Slippin,DMX has released his worst album yet. Dark and Hell is Hot was tight. Since then his albums has went down. IS Swizz Beats taking over DMX?
1,How do you go from It's dark to this?,"I thought you are supposed to get better not worse with every disc but DMX put out it's dark and hell is hot (one of the best cd's I have EVER heard)then does blood and then this it's just sad and I am starting to understand where kurupt is coming from.There is nothing that even comes close to it's dark,no damien no talks to god no nothing he is definately following the east coast puff daddy jigga fall off every year trend at least da WU TANG will be able to hold down a piece of da east because the WEST IS back on top where we should be.Snoop Dogg"
3,DMX......falling off album by album,"To start.....I am a DMX fan. He is a great rapper, but this release isn't all that great. He has about 6 good songs out of 18. That's not good. He needs to calm down and take his time. This was a quick release. Jay-Z had a quick release to and his album is alright but it could have been better. But back to X, he really is falling off, and losing fans at the same time. I'll always be a X fan, but I just think that he can do better than this album. -HDG"
3,Good but not us good us Still I Rise,"DMX is very good rapper and his new cd is good.I have both DXM's new cd and 2Pac's new cd ""Still I Rise and i have to say that 2Pac's new cd is better than DMX."
4,Not As Good As The Others!,"I am a big DMX fan but this album wasn't as good as the first two. It has some good songs such as: Party Up, What's My Name, & Good Girls, Bad Guys, But it can't compare to ""It's Dark and Hell Is Hot!"
1,Unlistenable!,If you want to hear the sound of a pre-recorded dog bark on every song then buy this cd! His last two albums far outshined this one.
1,This CD is trash!,I was listenting to this CD at a friends house! This is one of the worst CD's that I have ever heard...Its soooo gay he all he sings about is his damn dogs which he doesn't have any...If you want a real Rapper check out the west coast rapper...X-Raided
2,What a shame,"ok the first track is a nicely produced track by swizz beats which puts you in a good mood for the rest of the cd and if you skip to whats my name then you certainly begin to get a feel of the cd and start to smile, then the boomin party up which will have your head nodding.and after that well just throw the cd away from your moving car if i was you. i agree totally with what the reviewer below said good girls bad guys should have been left out rather than being a bonus track. and the rest of the songs are basically fillers. if you want to pay $16 for three songs tehn buy it if you dont think thats worth it then just live without this trash and just stick with its dark and hell is hot."
2,DMX COULD DO BETTER THAN THIS JUNK.,"THERE'S A COUPLE OF GOOD SONGS.HE RAPS ABOUT WOMEN ALOT.HE HAS R&B BEATS TO HALF OF HIS SONGS.IT'S NOT WORTH BUYING THE SONGS THAT YOU HEAR ON CABLE ARE WORTH GETTING,JUST BUY SINGLES OF HIS SONGS.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,An expected disapointment,"I just bought this disc and popped it in, thinking it might be was I was hoping for, but thinking maybe not. Turns out; not. In fact I would say the highlight is ""Prayer III,"" which is not usually my type of song, but it's really earnest and shows DMX's devotion. He tries hard, but unfortunetely falls."
4,This Ablum is hot....,"This album is hot, but it isn't a classic. It would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't the for the track where D prays - personally that didn't bother me _too_ much, but I still think that it was a bit out of place (considering how long it was). It would have been better if it were an interlude. Still though, overall, this album is a must for any DMX fan."
1,a good cd but..........,"the beats are wack dmx has sum tight rhymes but the beats let him down! maybe he should of gotten all the producers who made the beats for ""still i rise"""
4,DMX Delivers A Great CD,"This cd is tight for any rap fan. DMX delivers some great hits on this cd like ""What's My Name"", ""One More Road To Cross"", and ""Good Girls, Bad Guys."" I was expecting a little more and think he could have made it a lot better. But still this is a must have for any rap collection."
3,Where my dogs at ?,"This album isn`t that bad, but I ""It`s dark and hell is hot"" is a lot better. In addition to that I think that DMX is one of the most overrated rappers in the game. Rather check out 2Pac (The best rapper of all times), Snoop, Cube, Dre and also the early Nas"
4,This cd is really good,"It's good, but it would be better if that stupid Swizz Beats or whatever didn't mess with it. It's like all they have is a little 13 key synthesizer. Don't they know anything other than synthesized trumpets? Come on."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"If you thought DMX was done with his first two chart topping cd's, then your wrong. And then there was X... is the same hard rap that all DMX's fans love. He adds a couple new types of tracks on this one and there great. This is a cd where u can put it on and not have to worry about switching back and forth through songs. There isnt a song on this album that I dont like. So if you dont have And then there was X... you gotta get it cause it is a muste have!"
3,alright I guess,Nothing really great here I bought this album because I like the song party up but the rest of the tracks are pretty forgettable
3,its a good rap cd,"it is a good rap cd,if you want something different this is the cd for you.if you are tired with rappers bragging about how much ice they have or how much they are worth.if you are a dmx fan it is a must have cd"
2,As a real DMX fan,"I have to give this album a 2, as a real dmx fan, I have heard some underground stuff with some original beats, get on napster and dl born loser and hear dmx tell a story, dmx always, always, raps with passion, his beats may be weaker than usual and his lyrics are not nearly as prophetic as ""its dark..."" but he does not sell himself out on any track, otherwise this would get a 1. A real dmx fan will be able to appreciate the energy he puts into the music, no one emphasizes words better than x such as on ""one more road to cross"", but overall it seemed rushed he needs to sit down and write like he did on its dark. Hip hop enthusiasts skip this album and pick up his old stuff so you dont get an unfair opinion about a great artist."
3,Good and.....not so good.and good again,"This cd will be one of the best hip-hop slbums youve heard, unless you bought flesh of my flesh,blood of my blood or have ever heard any 2Pac song in your life.This was a good album, but given the time hes had to make it, its just weak compared to his second album.This isnt the kind of cd you can pop in your player, and listen from track one to the last one.However, the main reasons to buy cds are so you can hear the raw and uncut versions instead of the ... ... versions on tv and the radio.Get this if your an x fan, its a good cd, im not dissin it, but you probably would be better off getting his second album if you dont already have. ... ."
3,PRETTY GOOD EFFORT BY THE DARKMAN,"DMX's ""And Then There Was X"" is worth a listen. He is truly a step above the majority of mainstream hip hop performers and is worthy of the recognition he recieves. The CD features the big hit songs ""Party Up"" and ""What's My Name"" which are two high powered cuts that will probably remain on the radio for many years. The thing that I like best about this CD is DMX's range of emotions. He goes from being angry and unrelenting to soulful on ""Here We Go Again"". ""And Then There Was X"" has grown on me and I listen to it a lot."
3,Where my dogs at,"I think that DMX is the most overrated rapper in history. In addition to that this album is a lot weaker than his first one: ""It`s dark and hell is hot"". You should rather buy albums by such artists as 2pac, Ice Cube, LL, N.W.A., and Warren g."
2,DMX v.s. Kurupt,I was comparing this album too Kurupt's Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha. I found the Kurupt album to be much better than this. There are only a few tight joints on this album. Dmx has slipped since his 1st album. What's up with Dmx and Nas. They actually try to sing on a few of there tracks. What do you they think they can actually sing? Yeah right anyways. I exspected much more out of this album. Will DMX ever have another great album like It's Dark and Hell is Hot?
3,Not Anything Great......Could be better,"Compared to his other two cd's this cd is nothing...There are about 5 good songs on it, it just proves that just cause you have money doesnt mean your joint isnt going to always be good, , Some of these songs sound like songs that should have be left in the volt, but ""Whats My Name"", ""Fame"", ""Make a Move"", and ""X Is Coming"" are hot, its just that he needs better songs than songs like ""Dont You Ever"", and ""More 2 a Song""....Check out Kurupts ""The Streetz is a Mutha"" new cd or something because that is hot..."
3,And then there was DMX,"Here is the song by song review of his 3rd album needs soothing2.One More road to cross-does not fit his style 8/103.The Professional-Fits good with his style 9/106.Here we go again-goes okay with his style 8/107.Party Up in Here-does not fit but is Great maybe it does 10/108.Make a Move-does fit his style he does great 10/109.What they Want f Sisqo-This is pretty good 10/1010.Whats my name-is loud beat that works 10/1011.More 2 a song-this does fit his style 8/1012.Don't you ever-this is pretty good beat 9/1013.D-X-L(Hard White) Does do pretty good 9/1014.Comin for ya-Probaly to loud for him 8/1017.Angel-Does fit his style pretty good 8/1018.Good Girls,Bad Guys-Okay joint thats it 7/10Lyrically 8/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 7/10 Style 7/10 Voice 7Music 8/10 Innovative 7/10 Classic 7/10 Guest 7/10 Blends 7/10Overall 72 wich is a Middle 3.5 star release due to productionfor the third album in a row I will give it 3 stars ***^"
2,what happend he used to be good and now?,This album is not good at all so do not buy it. It only gets 2 because of production and 2 or 3 good songs.
2,Like in a Kennel....,"All you will hear is barking, yelling and screaming. But hey, that's what DMX is! The Ruff Rider himself is very dog-like, with one skit ""The Kennel"" in which dogs bark but he shuts them up. This ""EXPLICT"" version is definately NOT FOR YOUNGER ADDIENCES. DMX is very supsure on his Lyrics. But the CLEAN version is almost too squeaky clean, espically in the ""Party Up"" track, It sounds like Abbott and Costello or the Three Stooges are in the studio making sound effects for the edited version (When ever a bad word comes up, a ""BANG!"" or ""TRASHing"" noise is in the background)!!!! What can I say about DMX?"
2,X is all talk,"When i listen to DMX, i dont hear him flossin or flowin, instead all i hear is him spittin and TALKIN. And this is his style- talking throughout the whole album. You all now what i mean, the way he says a line (pause) another line (pause) another line (repeat for entire album) Sure, most of his beats and lyrics are tight, but without the essential flow over the mic, to me he is more of a preacher than a rapper. Thats why i turned to another ni**a with the same gruff voice but has mo flow- JA RULE BABY! he's goin off at the mo. Cant wait til Jigga, Ja and X get together- Murder inc. Ahh Yeh!"
4,TIGHT!!!,"DMX came back with ""And Then There Was X"" after the disapointed -in my opinion- ""Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of my blood"". This time he came strong, rhyming with fury 'bout guns, murders, women and his relation with GOD.It's a great album, tight beats, tight lyrics, of course there's a few missteps but overall X shows why he's one of the top rappers of the year 2G."
5,dmx's best album to date,"Hey this is a great album with gansta tracks, mellow tracks and pary tracks. You can not go wrong with this cd. Track The Professional is a great hardcore gangsta hyme about dmx addressing a buster. Dmx uses his hardcore rap style to bust out this track, if it is to much for you dont bother checkin out tha full album. The tracks party up and Good Girls, Bad Guys are great party/crusin anthems, but best of all these tracks are fun to listen to. One of the best songs on this cd features sisqo. ""what these (...)want from a (...) where dmx address all the women in his life. He tell them that they just use and abuse him. This album is good becuase it is all staight out gangsta (...) and no bling bling(thanx god). I heard the great depression and it is not that great if you r a new dmx fan then cop this album instead of the great dression."
5,Party Up!,"When DMX released ""Flesh..."" after the his classic 1998 debut, I thought that he would continue to fall off. I was wrong. With this cd, he comes back with better rhymes and beats even though it's not like ""It's Dark..."" No need to use the skip buttons on this cd. The best track is the anthem ""Party Up."" It sounds like it's his answer to Kurupt's ""Callin Out Names."" He shares the limelight with LOX and Drag-On on ""DXL,"" though it seems it would be better without Drag. This album is filled with emotional tracks and street anthems. 4x platinum means it's pretty good."
4,ALMOST PERFECT,"You would have to be crazy not to give this cd a good review, he gives more hot beats and tight lyrics than any other rapper around. Although this is a great cd... no cd will ever compare to ""It's dark and hell is hot"". EVER!"
2,Dogs? How does DMX rep anything but pussies...,"I'm sorry, DMX WAS hardcore and all...But then came a green eyed dummy by the name of Swizz Beats...Irv Gotti was all over the first album, now Swizz claims he is the machine behind Ruff Ryders...? forget that...That's bullsh!t! Look at the people that listen to DMX now! They're all 8th grade white kids, and hispanic girls that think he's ""fine""...That's not hardcore...I know what would fit DMX's new image. A duet with LL COOL J...That'll get the clubs bumpin! Leave the hardcore thug NY imagery to BuckShot, NAS, Boot camp Clik, and of course AZ!"
2,not as good his other cd's,Well for starters it seemed like the same track was playing over and over again. The same backround music. The same voice. It was one of those cd's where u could listen to the whole thing without realizing the first track had ended. No track struck me as different from the others. If you are true DMX fanatic then I would say go head and get the cd. But if not then it is not worth your money.
2,"Slippin, fallin Can't get up","I think that DMX is outplaying himself. No doubt he is one of the best rappers to hit the scene since Public Enemy but I think the quick succession of three albums in just over a year has used up his originality. Rest my man, Money is not all to Music"
1,Dear God No!,"If you claim to like hip hop, please by the following albums before you buy this one :1) Illmatic 2) Ready to Die 3) 36 Chambers 4) Full Clip : A decade of gangstarrThese are what hip hop is all about."
3,It iite,not so great cant beat the first two... not as dark inmy opinion but its still okay... Dmx is still hot though...
5,DMX TO THE FULLEST,I HAVE LISTENED TO EVERY DMX CD HE HAS PUT OUT AND EVERY TIME THEY JUST GET BETTER AND BETTER... HE HAS A VERY UNIQUE STYLE OF MUSIC THAT JUST GRABS YOUR EARS AND MAKES YOU WANT TO LISTEN HE IS THE BEST RAPPER! GRRRRR....PEACE
1,How Can I Say this Politely..........?,"This is bullcrap and it is mostly the production. Swizz Beats and his Ruff Ryder production team is just no good. The beats are WACK. Maybe a couple nice tracks but overall the album is forgettable and whoever said this album was more than three stars is smokin something serious. DMX could be great because he has a lot of personality and pours emotion into his songs, but with Swizz Beats........It's sad to say that will never happen. Party Up with its mad exposure is so played out it makes you wanna jump off of a cliff. Unlistenable. other ok songs include One More Road To Cross, DXL, What's My Name and uh nothing else. Please save your money and bypass this horrendous display of production. DMX is an above average rapper though."
4,And Then There Was X (Explicit Lyrics) by DMX,"I was scared to come out of the closet. It started with the voice - it made me weak in the knees. I still continued to deny it. The music is infectious! One day I couldn't take it anymore; I was on my way home from work; the beat and the voice took over my car. I drove to my favorite music store and was disappointed when I heard, ""WE DON'T SELL EXPLICIT LYRICS."" I was DEVASTATED!I asked a friend of mine, who would keep it on the down low, to borrow his CD. I played it low. Didn't want the neighbors to get the wrong idea. You know, the P, N, H, D, and all those other bad words. When I am in the car - by myself- I blast it! At work you wanna enter on your screen saver, "".....UP IN HERE,"" but I like to eat and have a roof over my head. So, you put it on the one at home.Finally, I couldn't take it anymore, I came out of the closet- I purchased the CD and began admitting to everyone that this GOOD girl loves this BAD boy's music."
2,Very Dissapointing,I have every1 of his c.d.'s and this was just sad. He could not live up to It's Dark and Hell is Hot which is one of the best c.d.'s ever. Then there was X has maybe 3 good songs that's it
4,Off the Chain,"X killed it the 3rd time around. I gave it 4 stars because all of the tracks are hot except 2- track 4,""Fame"" has an OK beat and the lyrics are aiight and track 12, ""Don't you Ever"". That is the worst beat X rhymed on, but it's worth listening to because X rips it. Cop this quick."
2,Very Average,"X's 3rd album is definately his worst. Unfortunately he played the commercial game a bit here and his style is not the old violent DMX we knew from his previous albums. Evidence of this is doing ""What These B*****s Want"", a duet with Sisqo. SISQO! There were a few joints that were okay but not as good as anything on his earlier ones. ""One More Road"" and ""Party Up"" are my best joints on here. I recommend you listen to It's Dark... and Flesh Of My Flesh instead. Or save your money and buy The Great Depression, which is much better than this."
2,Very Confused and Isolated,"I really don't buy DMX's religious beliefs, especially whenthey are mixed with lyrics that are the same as Eminem. Between songs,he says verses and prayers from the bible that keep him an honest man,all the while rapping about prostitutes and his ""can't touchthis"" attitude(What's My Name?, among others)..."
3,whut? arf playahata,"When I listened his 1st album 'it's dark.....hot' it was bomb however when i met his 3rd album, i just wanted to get my money back. I don't know what has changed but I can feel it has changed. I can't feel his voice no more just like before anyway Yo D Cut It Out And Make It Up"
3,3 out of 5,"this is cd is hot, but i think that dmx can do better.the song ""what's my name"" was awesome, and the last song ""good girl, bad guys"" makes it worth it to buy this cd. if you're a true dmx fan, i advise you to buy this cd, if you're new with dmx, go grab his first cd ""is dark and hell is hot"". his first cd is the best. when dmx comes out with a new album i'm hoping to see some improvment."
2,Where's the hardcore?,"Positives: DMX still brings it hardcore on a few tracks and you can see why his previous albums were so popular. His voice is cool and I like the intensity he puts into his rap.Negatives: He has all the same faults as Ja Rule or maybe it's the other way around. Too commercial now, and his spectrum of topics is very limited. I guess he tried to freshen his style up a little, but I like the grimy underground music X used to put out and this album only briefly visits that part. ""Party Up"" is undoubtedly the worst track on the album but it's the video he put on TV first. The rapping in most of these songs is still pretty decent but the choruses are just bad. What's next? Singing kids? We should have let him stay underground."
5,Collection,"Had this as a cassette and wanted the songs for my Ipod. Gotta have fun when you are running to ""Walk like an Egytian"" and ""Manic Monday"" seems to be my theme song."
1,worst skillet ever,"This is an awful electric skillet. As mentioned, it doesn't heat evenly, and it takes FOREVER to cook anything. The handles on the pan get hot like the rest of the pan, so it's a little deceiving because you think you can just lift the pan off when you're done, but instead you burn your hands. Don't buy it!"
1,A real disappointment,"Great design in concept and appearance, but you would do better to hold a candle under a frying pan. This skillet is raised in center so oil and liquids run off to edges. Even after checking and re-checking to make sure that the pan was properly seated on the base, it took forever to brown pre-cooked breakfast sausage and even cook scrambled eggs while this thing was on high (400). I'll bet that had I left them in the pan and walked away, the skillet would not have been able to burn the eggs! I'm not going to keep it long enough to see whether the non-stick coating peels off after 3 or 4 uses as others have reported. What is most disappointing though, is that Rival continues to market this piece of garbage. They had to be aware of its performance long before making the decision to put it on the market, and that speaks volumes about the company."
1,Not worth it...,"I agree with most of the other bad complaints about this product. The only good thing about the frying pan is that it comes off to clean. The bad part is that it does come off. The pan sits on the heating coils and does not get as hot as the pans with internal coils. This also makes the temperature setting worthless, as it isn't correct. You have to set it at 375 to cook something that would normally have a 325 setting. All in all, I would not recommend this product."
2,Defeat the safety feature,The safety engineers have done it to us again. They have incorporated a safety button that prevents the element from heating if the pan is removed. The only problem is that the pan does not depress the button far enough for the unit to come fully on when the pan is in place...it won't even boil a cup of water! I defeated that safety feature by wadding up a piece of duct tape and jamming it in the recess then covering with another piece to keep the button depressed. Now it works perfectly!
1,"Too bad there isn't a ""negative star"" rating","In addition to the crappy design and worse execution mentioned by other reviewers, this pan is out and out dangerous. The exposed element could easily injure, and injure seriously, if the user forgets that it's hot, and pan isn't in place."
1,"Should have been a good product, but...","This would have been a great product except for one problem. The pan has a raised center! This makes it impossible to fry, as the oil settles in the edges of the pan with none left in the center. What were these designers thinking?"
3,not hot,I love the whole idea of this fryer it just does not get hot enough to cook things. Fried chicken gets whimpy.
1,dissatisfied,"I received the skillet as a christmas gift. It was paid for with my credit card.The heating element must be faulty, as the coils don't turn red. It takes so long to cook anything. The bottom, (teflon coated), is bubbling and I believe the teflon is coming off. I use wood or vinyl cooking utensils on it and it looks bad to me. The fact that the coils are not getting red, even at 400 degrees, leads me to think that have a faulty skillet. I feel that I should get my money back or a replacement. I am sure to put the pan on the coils properly but it is just a terrible disappointment to me as I have not had bad luck with other rival products I have bought. what or who do I contact to find some resolution to this problem? Your help and advice will be truly appreciated. Phyllis Truscott e-mail ohl_laydie@yahoo.com"
1,Rival electric skillet - don't buy it!!!,"We got a new Rival electric skillet and the heating element stopped working within months. The manufacturer sent a replacement and that, also, lasted just a few months. So we are now on our third heating element (the whole bottom part that plugs in - not the pan itself or the lid) and it has also failed. We've had enough! This item cost about $60 and we had great expectations for it. We also have a great need for it. But, we would rather work out another solution than to continue with the headaches of this product. If you decide to purchase this item, good luck to you!Details:This is the 12 x 16"" model with the dial control that is not digital. The pan is removeable. The light still comes on when you turn the dial but the coil never heats. There is a small button on the heating element that matches up to a bump on the bottom of the pan and it is very obvious when you have the pan seated correctly."
1,Junk,I've used this skillet occasionally and it quit working-only works if I push down it- suspect it has to do with the safety switch. Everything sticks to the pan and it's not the easiest to store.
1,NON-STICK COATING A FRAUD,"I WISH I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS LOUSY PRODUCT. RIVAL SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS FOR MARKETING SUCH A POOR SKILLET THAT DOES NOT PERFORM TO SPECIFICATIONS. WHILE THE REMOVABLE SKILLET AND GLASS TOP ARE GOOD FEATURES, THE ALMOST IMMEDIATE DETERIORATION OF THE NON-STICK COATING CANCELS THEM OUT. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO RIVAL BUT HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY, MUCH LESS ANY REDRESS OF THIS HORRIBLE DEFECT. CONSUMERS NEED TO BOYCOTT RIVAL."
1,Run Away!!,"I agree 100% with the other reviewer. The cooking surface is not flat, so pancake batter all runs to the sides. EVERYTHING sticks to the surface, except oil. The heating is so uneven you have to shift everything constantly to keep from burning one side while the other stays raw. It is virtually impossible to cook with, and horrible to clean. I would rather cook with a hot rock over coals. The cooking surface would be just as level, and food certainly couldn't stick to the rock any worse. At least the heating would be more even.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,"Bad, bad skillet","I received this for Christmas and after a few uses, the coating started coming off the skillet. It really doesn't get hot enough to brown quickly. I have e-mailed Rival to try to purchase a replacement pan, but if the other reviews are any indication, I'll get no response. Rival does need to pull this product and give refunds or replacements. I have an old Farberware 12-inch skillet that does fine after about 30 years of use. But I wanted this large 16 x 12 size. Rival, please do something!"
1,Rival S16RB Skillet a disappointment,"Rival S16RB 12-by-16-Inch Oblong-Shaped Electric Skillet with Removable PanI watched this product for months waiting for the price to drop from $50 or $60 to $40. I was so excited when I bought the product for this great price, only to be disappointed upon using the product. I have had no problems with sticking or peeling yet. I read the product manual and heated oil in the pan to ""season"" it prior to my first use. I have experienced the uneven cooking surface and uneven cooking temperatures. I find the thermostat annoying as the light just indicates that it is on and there is no indication that the set temperature has been reached. The highest temperature is 400 degrees and I doubt that it even reaches this temp. It takes forever to cook and it really doesn't fry at the temperatures attained. This could have been an excellent product but is extremely disappointing."
1,Doesn't Rate One Star because of the faulty non stick surface,I love the design and idea behind this skillet. However the non stick surface is not properly bonded to the metal. After a few weeks it starts flaking off in your food. This is my second skillet. The first one was returned and I was given a replacement. I was extreamly careful using only wooden spatulas and spoons. After just a few uses the Teflon began flaking off anyway. I would not recommend this product at all. It seems thay are all faulty. I know for a fact 2 out of 2 were for me. There should be a recall on this product.
2,"Looks impressive, but has serious design defect...","I purchased this unit primarily for the removable pan. The way Rival markets this unit, it sounded like a nice feature. However, after using it the first time I noticed the pan bows in the center when heated up. If you try to cook anything that has a liquid consistancy (ie, eggs, pancakes, etc...) the food item runs to the sides of the pan. This happens due to the pan thickness being too thin, causing the center to expand and bow up in the center when heated. It could have easily been resolved if they had either made the pan thicker or put ribs on the pan to provide structural support.Don't waste your money on this skillet if you are expecting a flat cooking surface."
4,Rival Oblong-Shaped Elecrtic Skillet,So far I like the Rival Oblong-Shaped Electric Skillet w/ removable pan. The removable pan is an added plus. I just wish someone could come up with a lid system that doesn't get water everywhere when yo take the lid off.
1,"If you like the taste of Teflon, buy this skillet.","Bought this to replace our trusty old one.I hate it!! Everything sticks to the surface.One little added bonus...the Teflon is flaking off. I thoughtit might be due to scrubbing, but it's not. I noticed it comingoff while I was cooking. Had to throw the meal out.Bottom line...if you are one of the many Americans wholike Teflon in their food...perhaps you might think itadds flavor...then buy this skillet. If not, then look elsewhere."
1,Absolutely awful electric skillet!,"When my ancient electric skillet recently died after years of solid reliability, I found this model to be irresistible on the shelf... where it should have stayed. In addition to the low quality of the nonstick coating, I find that the ultra thin sides, and the pitiful BTU out put of the heating element mean that any oil will not reach 210 degrees, even when cranked all the way up and left alone on the counter. This product is an embarrassment to RIVAL, and I wish I had done more research on the web before simply choosing the best looking thing on the shelf."
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited to receive this skillet for Christmas this year. The Vented glass lid, large size, and removable, dishwasher safe skillet all seemed perfect until I tried to use it today. It is slightly raised in the middle so my pancakes 'slid' unevenly to one side, the heat is mostly in the middle of the pan and it doesn't get up to heat very quickly.Unfortunately I am going to use my gift receipt to trade it in for the Presto."
5,BIG AND BEAUTIFUL,"I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED WHEN I OPENED THE BOX AND SAW MY NEW ELECTRIC SKILLET.IT WAS MORE THAN I HOPED FOR. I USED IT THE VERY SAME NIGHT. IT COOKED VERY WELL.I REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE BASED AND SERVED IN IT TOO!!! THE CLEANUP WAS GREAT JUST HOT SOAPY WATER AND IT WAS LIKE NEW. I RECOMMEND THE PAN FOR ANYONE WHO HAS TO COOK FOR A LARGE FAMILY, IT REALLY HOLDS ALOT."
1,what a piece of CRAP,"we bought the rival s16rb about two weeks ago. nice appearance and the idea of a removal pan from the heating element appealed, but after two uses the teflon started peeling off, yum yum.hopefully we'll get a refund when we take it back to kohls.Do not buy this skillet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE,I have used electric skillets for years and years. I was so excited to get this new one because I thought the removeable pan would be a huge plus. That idea was a huge plus BUT the pan itself was absolutely awful. Everything and I mean everything sticks to this surface. You can actually see while scrubbing lightly that the coating just comes right off. Although that being said...it's no great loss because it didn't work anyways. I definitely would NOT recommend this!!!
1,Fryer woes,"I replaced an electric skillet and thought this would be very useful and handy. What a mistake !!! This pan is raised in the center and does not cook evenly. You have to move food around the sides to pick up liquid so it gets coated and will cook. The sides brown but the middle does not. Potatoes, bacon, chicken all need to be constantly rotated to try to get them to cook. I wish I had my old skillet back. I will certaintly replace this as soon as I can."
2,not rival's best product,"Although this skillet performs very basic tasks, it is not Rival's best product. It does a satisfactory job of browning chopped meat or making pasta sauce, but there are better ways to cook pancakes or fried eggs."
5,BEST SKILLET I NOW OWN,This skillet is now my best skillet. I love it! The skillet is deep enough to fry chicken in but it's not too deep so that you can't fry eggs in it. I love that you can remove it from the base so it can be cleaned without having to worry about getting anything wet. I use the skillet just about every day and I only wish now that I had bought it earlier. If I could give it 10 stars I would. GREAT SKILLET!!
2,Too long to cook,"Searched for this particular model with the detachable pan. After getting it the pan itself is made of extremely light weight aluminum. The lid is heavier than the pan. Cooked some cut up chicken in it for stir fry. Took forever. Even took some out of an already NOT overcrowded pan, and it still took forever to cook. Have to see if there is a way to gauge and see if the temperature on the dial actually corresponds to real temp. The pan has a great size, and reaaly liked the detachable pan feature. But the way it has cooked in 2 attempts now really means the only thing it is good for is a warming dish. Really dissappointed as I had cooked with a regular Rival electric frying pan for years. Am going to try and return this one. will let you know how customer service is."
1,Disapointed,"Rival S16RB 12-by-16-Inch Oblong-Shaped Electric Skillet with Removable PanNot sure what they mean by non-stick!!! Have used twice and it is impossible to clean. Butter, Pam, nothing keeps food from sticking to this very poor skillet.We bought this skillet because of the removable Pan. BAD mistake. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT...A BIG WASTE OF MONEY"
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!,The only use I have found so far is as a warming tray. To repeat DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Shame on me. I always read reviews but was in the middle of a kitchen renovation and was very impressed that it also was a serving dish (a very expensive dish). It is raised in the middle so it is hard to fry anything without using a ton of oil. Doesn't cook evenly it's just a waste of metal.
1,Some Like it Hot,"This electric skillet does not know the meaning of the word ""hot"". Even on the highest temperature, medium heat is about the best you can get. It takes forever to cook anything, and the temperature does not stay constant. I hate this skillet and would never buy another Rival product."
1,Total Junk,"My husband purchased this skillet at a neighborhood store while I was away. After following the manufacturer's directions for seasoning the skillet pan, he cooked some delicious french toast, using a heat-proof KitchenAid spatula, and washing after cool, in warm soapy water with a sponge. When dry, he noticed the coating was already gone in places, especially on the sides where it virtually had not been touched. When I got home, we used it a second time to cook bacon, and not only did the surface show more wear, but it would just not come clean. We tried to use it a third time to pan fry zucchini fritters, using a cup of oil, and it never got hot enough. Using a candy thermometer, we determined that it no longer heated above 225 degrees. Unfortunately my husband didn't keep the receipt or packing materials. Hate to add to the landfills, but this is going in the trash. What a disappointment! If I could give it negative stars, I would."
1,Dang it! Dang it! Dang it!,"I have always prided myself on the fact that I research a product before purchasing it through reviews....I made a mistake and impulsively purchased the WORST electric skillet I have ever had. Here I am with the coating coming off and mad thinking...I can make it for a while longer trying to get my moneys worth out of it but that is impossible. Now, not only is it a health threat to me and my family b/c of the chipping ""All stick"" coating going into our food, it will be another piece of trash littering up our landfills when it should have been an excelent product to have for a long time. So dissapointed! Rival, you know better!"
1,"zero stars, really!","Like the other reviewers, I was impressed by this skillet...until I used it! This should be taken off the market so no one else has to waste their time! How this passed any tests is beyond me! It does heat unevenly, sticks, etc... e.g., to cook bacon, one should start with cold skillet, but for this skillet you are supposed to heat the skillet for 15 min. with the lid on first! Even holding heat is unpredictable. It is just terrible! They should be ashamed, and really, Amazon should not carry this except for the fact that we can warn others about it via this form."
1,"Eggs stick like glue and pancakes doughy, too.","A HORRIBLE product!! EVERYTHING sticks to the pan. It heats unevenly, and cooks s..l..o..w..l..y. Cleanup takes forever! Do not buy this product!! You will waste your money."
1,nonstick coating peeling off,We've had our skillet a few months and now the nonstick coating is peeling off like crazy. What a waste of money and natural resources. It also makes me concerned about toxic substances that we might have been ingesting all this time. Terrible product. They really should offer a recall. It's a good design idea. They should offer it with a cast iron pan.
2,lousy,the electric skillet takes forever to heat up and it does not heat in the corners also it takes longer to cook than an electric frying pan I would not recommend this product. thank you
1,Rival S16RB,Received this item as a Christmas gift and with very little use non-stick coating starting coming off. Do not understand why this product has not been recalled since it is not safe. Probably the worse quality of any product I have owned.
1,"Lousy Product, do not buy","I bought this skillet to use for hashbrowns at Senior Breakfasts. I have had nothing but trouble with it not heating or heating, then shutting off half way through the cooking.It is not reliable, at all. It is a big disappointment."
1,RIVAL ELECTRIC SKILLET,I got this as a wedding gift and was excited- WORST PRODUCT ever- all of the liquid goes to the sides making it impossible to use- I am going to contact Rival for my money back - what a joke - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
5,Hombre by Elmore Leonard,"This was my introduction to Elmore Leonard and I became hooked. Was very familiar with the excellent Paul Newman film, despite my familiarity with the story it sprang fresh off the page and made compulsive reading. Thoroughly to be recommended to all western fans."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Elmore Leonard, but he must have written this when he was 16 years old. It's ponderous, bereft of action, and a complete disappointment. Luckily, the 1967 movie based on this book featured Paul Newman...so the movie was good. And luckily Leonard's writing improved (for me, anyway)."
2,dissapointed,"Been a long time since I've read Leonard's stuff. Having fondly remembered Get Shorty, Maximum Bob and Rum Punch, I thought I'd download a few of his books to my new Kindle. Hombre had potential, but it went largely unexploited and the ending was extremely weak. I would have rated it one-star, but I'm now halfway through Leonard's Glitz and I think I might need to reserve one-star status for that one. Yaaaaawn!"
5,Classic Leonard,One of the best western tales by one of the best story tellers in this genre. Great dialogue and Leonard is an artist in setting up a suspenseful tale of the way it was.
5,Well written,Big Elmore Leonard fan. The characters are straight and to the point. Not alot of useless dialog. Got too love the strong silent type.
3,Very small earrings,The earrings come with very nice box but their size is very small. Also wearing them are very difficult. They are not bad earrings but if I have another choice I wouldn't buy it again.
4,How can one review an item you hav'nt received?,"An excellent work of high academic standard. I used it some years ago during my studies. Unfortunately it was not returned after someone borrowed it. My review applies only to the copy I had long ago.However, after almost one month I hav'nt yet received the book.I was informed that it was mailed via airmail some time ago. You surely can understand that I've lost my enthusiasm in supporting your servicesand will in future attempt to source elsewhere.RegardsEugene Ferreira."
4,very cute,very cute sheep. probably works better as a mobile for stroller than over a crib given the size. I'm probably enjoying it more than my 2 months old at the moment.
2,Uninspiring compared to earlier work.,"This is the fourth book I have read by Sharon Olds. I found The Father to be less enjoyable than her other collections of poetry such as Satan Says or The Dead and the Living.In The Father, it seems that Olds has finally come to terms with her father and forgiven him for the past, but I am not sure if Olds just doesn't have anything left to say, or if I'm just not interested in hearing it. To me, The Father seems to be typical and redundant-in content and style. Don't get me completely wrong though, there were a few poems I really liked, and several metaphors here and there really caught my attention. As usual, Olds was very frank and direct about her emotions, but overall I felt very uninspired by this collection of poems. By the end I was just bored and ready to be done with the book. It is like reading someone who doesn't know what to write about but feels compelled to write anyway. If you have never read Olds, I would recommend her earlier work first."
4,Very pleasant,"Few people enjoy the same music in the massage room but they all enjoyed this one. Ambient music is great but often I get too relaxed while working; other Cds may offer three beautiful cuts and then something disturbing. This CD changes up a bit but even the liviest of cuts is beautifully melodic, which is what I look for both for my client and also to aid in keeping myself present as the day goes on. I would recommend this to any massage therapist or for simple relaxation. It is not complicated, only very pleasant."
4,Unwind......,"I really enjoy listening to Spa Lounge. It helps me unwind and forget about work, etc... My baby really enjoys it too we fall asleep listening to it. The music is very melow, it's deep thinking music. Very nice."
3,Cake stand that has class,"It is a beautiful piece, Macy's did deliver it on time and packing was wonderful. It doesn't take much space on the table and it looks really elegant. I just wish this is not that over priced. Don't forget to keep the original box as you may be able to sell it to a collector in 30 years and original box is the key to get a good selling price."
1,Worthless,This summary was misleading and the book is useless for non-professional artists. I expected to find info on where to go for artist retreats.
5,"""Your Trip Into Space"" by Lynn Poole","Being a kid that grew up in the middle 1950's, I loved reading this book as an adult. The concept of space travel, back in the late 1940's and 1950's, seemed a lot more interesting back then than the reality of what actually happened. This book was actually projecting what would be and hopefully how it would happen. That's the idea behind the concept. In a nutshell, I loved reading this book and remembering where we were at the time. Were things better then? No, but they were sure simpler than they are now. It's nice to travel back in time once in awhile!"
2,not entirely happy,This is not really what I envisioned. There are too many panels and therefore when there is the slightest breeze they blow around. The closure at the front does not close all the way. If I did not have to pay the shipping I would have sent it back. I will probably attach the panels together with thread or tape so they don't blow around with the wind.
1,Not a Functional Mosquito Net,"This is a inexpensive net it you are looking for a decorative style accent. However, it is not a funtional mosquito net. There is not enough overlap inbetween panels, the panels do not hang straight down, the mesh is not fine enough, and finaly the material itself is of low quality. Do not buy this if you desire to evade malaria."
1,Only a fantasy - does not protect from mosquitoes,"This is not a mosquito net. It is simply for show. I wasted my money buying this product. If I did not live in a developing country (which amazon, only ships books to) I would send this product back. Due to my current location I need to protect myself from mosquitoes which carry parasites that either kill you or make you very ill. This product has so many slits and gaps in it, you could literally drive a small car through it.I do not recommend this product at all, unless of course you want a simple expensive dust collector."
2,Needs to be modified to stop insects,We live in a tropical location where mosquitos prevail. This net comes with huge gaps that once we sewed together and peg up at night mostly keeps out mosquitos. I would look elsewhere for a better net and pay more. The quality of the netting is good if all you want is a fancy look.
1,Not for a queen size bed!,"The description says it's will fit a queen size bed. Not So! It hung so low it hit the bed. No way could you sleep without having it laying on you. I tried every angle and direction. It would not work for a queen size bed. It was also a very cheap material. Needless to say, I returned it."
1,Don't waste your money,"This might be a good product for someone who wants something purely for looks but as far as functionality it is a waste of money. There are so many gaps and the fabric is cut so poorly that we had to use 26 - count 'em - 26 safety pins in an attempt to keep out mosquitos. Where the fabric should have been cut straight in order to overlap the open flaps it was cut at angles away for each other so we had to pull it to make it overlap. There are huge gaps at every corner, presumably for the bed posts, and not enough fabric to overlap and cover the holes. There is no way this is useful as bug netting."
2,Dissatisfied,"This is not at all what I thought it would be. Very complicated to put up. I have a King-sized bed and I did not get the desired look I was hoping to get. This is the first time I've ever had to return anything ordered from Amazon.com, but as the saying goes....there's a first time for everything."
3,There is a Cut in the middle,"The canopy seems to look a lot better in the picture than in person. First of all it won't work very well for a Full and especially a Twin bed, the whole thing sags and you have to hang more parts of it up on the ceiling so it won't touch you as you lay in the bed. The middle part sags because there it splits in to two pieces(the picture makes it look like just one piece), this is the most deceiving part of the whole thing, the whole thing hangs oddly. I still like the effect it brings to my bedroom so I decided to keep it anyways."
4,Nice Product - Very Cool Looking!,"We bought this because my wife found it online and thought that it was pretty but the fact is that I enjoy it as much as she does. This very inexpensive item makes our room look like a palace. It really is very nice, easy to install and very attractive. We bunched up the corners so ours looks a little different than the stock photos but it turned out very nice. We also made ours flat to the ceiling so that it didn't hang down like the stock photo and it turns out much better."
5,love it ! !,It is so pretty. I live in an apartment and it does not make the room look smaller at all like I thought it would. the best thing to buy for a bedroom.
1,Very poor and useless mosquito net,"Completely useless as a mosquito net. It has large gaps and the mesh is cut on the bias so that you cannot actually close the side or the roof of the netting. I had to use 30 clothes pegs to keep it closed until I bought a decent mosquito net locally.I think they ought to say ... ""for decorative purposes only""."
3,not practical mosquito net,"Nice esthetically, but not practical for keeping mosquitoes out. Too many holes."
4,"heavenly 4-post canopy, ecru","I love it, could connect a little bit more on the sides, but I love it. I feel like there is a little bit of paradise brought to my room."
4,Pretty!,"This adds a pretty nice feel to my bedroom. The material seems pretty durable - I tried poking a hole in it with the end of one of the hooks and it didn't give. It's not as white out of the package as it is in the picture; it's more of a cream color. I'm not sure if this is standard or just mine happened to be off-color, but I don't mind it.The only 'drawback' is that this thing is huge. If I try to pin it up above the corners of my bed, the middle panel is barely a foot off my bed (hence why I was trying to poke a hole, I wanted to pin the middle section to the ceiling :p). I have a string of ""fairy lights"" to hang up as well; this was the perfect finishing touch. I finally have the room I always wanted. :)"
4,Nice,"Nice product, looks so good over my bed, i highly recommend it, it gives a very romantic feel to any bedroom, it becomes a princesses's bed:) the colour is a litle lighter than it looks..."
3,Okay as decoration - not against bugs,"The net is pretty and gives a nice 'princess' feel to a bed...however, I need a net to stop mosquitos, and this one has large gaps between the pieces of netting. No matter now it's hung, there are gaps.Enjoy as a decorative touch."
5,AVANT,THIS CD IS OFF THE CHAIN. I CAN BE SITTING AT WORK THINKING OF ONE OF HIS SONGS AND I CAN JUST BREAK DOWN AND START SINGING. NOW THATA CRAZY. THE PEOPLE AT MY JOB ALSO SAYS THAT A GOOD CD. IF U HAVENT HEARD IT THEN U SHOULD GO AND GET IT.
5,Avant,"This album is fantastic, i love it, every song you can isten to over and over again if you are a fan of avant."
3,okay debut,"Avant can sing but these songs on the album are not good for a successful debut. There is a reason for dubbin music and this, is one of them because ""Separated"" and ""My first Love"" are the only the best songs. ""Why "" is good but this album needs more, whether it's more better prodution or more ke ke Wyatt. But if you have to have it , dubb it. one."
2,DULL DULL DULL,"Avant has an unexceptional voice. He has average lyrics. Worse still, each song passes you by without ever really catching your attention. Infact hes not even good looking!!He covers the same old ""ghetto romance"" topics with the same old ghetto slang. I cheat on you, im a playa, im a thug, im really hard WE'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE!!Why do women enjoy being insulted?Still if this is your type of music, buy Avant, get him paid, enjoy bland r'n'b."
2,There's a reason for singles.,After listening this cd I wanted to run back to Sam Goody and get a prompt refund. I would have rather given my 14.99 to the Bush Campaign (and I'm a democrat) than to have spent it on this cd. The single that Avant has out is very misleading. That was the best one on the album. I doubt that theres going to be any more singles.
5,Making the Team Makes the Grade!,"Whether you work in teams, design them, or study them, you will find much of value in this book. Drawing on a wealth of social and behavioral science findings, Leigh Thompson shows the advantages, and the pitfalls, of getting things done through teamwork. Clearly written, with many case examples, Thompson builds on her research and consulting experiences to create a complex picture of what makes groups tick. I particularly liked her explanation of how to foster creativity in teams, as well as how to deal with the inevitable conflicts that arise. She notes that teams are not a panacea. However, under the right conditions, properly organized teams contribute substantially to their organizations. If you're dissatisfied with the way things are going in your organization, this book would make a great (anonymous?) gift for your boss!"
4,Pedals,"They are very inexpensive yet rugged and well built; very close to what I wanted, only a smudge too small but they work otherwise. Lightweight and the ""tongue"" at the edge of the pedal grasps the tennis shoe very well (I don't like clip-ons).For the price these are a bargain."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I currently own a 9 inch screen portable DVD player from Panasonic (LS-90)and I love it. I was looking for an inexpensive DVD player that I could use in the house to hook up to the TV and give my other one a break so I decided to go with the Yahoo DVD player. I didn't mind that it didn't have a screen because I could always use my primary player for road trips, etc. The Yahoo player doesn't have an on/off switch so the player's motor constantly runs if not unplugged after every use. I owned it about 30 days when I first experienced a problem with the player reading some movies I attempted to play and I unplugged it and gave it another try after a few minutes. Bottom line is it burned out in 60 days from the date of purchase and of course you can't return electronic items after 30 days so I'm stuck with a $50 piece of plastic that doesn't work. Buyer beware is all I can tell you."
2,"Leaky, Thin, Watery, Slimy Mess!","Hey, this is not chocolate in the actual sense. I expected it to be close to a container of chocolate frosting. It was not. It is like syrup, thin and runny. The taste is not milk chocolate. All you can taste is sugar and bitterness. There is no chocolate taste like anyone living in the US is familiar with."
1,natural???,"I am not quite sure why this product is found under the 'natural' foods category. In the ingredients we find artificial flavors and we also find partially hydrogenated oils. This product most certainly should not be considered ""natural"" or healthy."
4,Quest,"If you want a simple film to watch, you might like this but I found it was interesting to the very end. I longed for more and I can say for one thing, it's enjoyable to watch despite some of the acting."
2,B Style Movie,"If you enjoy the ""B"" style movies, you may enjoy this film but if your are an ""A"" Lister then you will hate this film."
1,Absolute Junk........,"Dont waste your money....even if they paid you to watch, your time would be better spent watching food defrost in the microwave. If this was supposed to be a spoof then it should have stated that. I cant explain what is going on in this so called movie other than people not even acting being recorded doing nothing."
1,THIS IS NOT KAGEMUSHA!!! IT'S THE SOUNDTRACK TO DERSU UZALA!,"I'm really cheesed about this. I ordered it some time ago, and it arrived and turned out to be the soundtrack from a different Kurosawa movie -- Dersu Uzala -- not Kagemusha. I've tried to get the listing corrected, but to no success. Be warned! I'd rate ZERO stars (for the listing!) if I could..."
5,Knitting 1940's style,"It's 1942. The war is on, so quit being a whiny little b*, pick up you needles, and knit something. If you can get creative with yarn, learn to love seaming and kitchener, you can make yourself a variety of slinky German spy secretary dresses, natty accessories, and even a pair of swim trunks for that sailor you've been eyeing. Classic."
5,"Great, Love it!","Can't beat it for the price, works great!Doesn't get the tough stuff or really fine stuff, need a touch-up razor for that, but great for basic grooming in a pinch."
2,Ouch!,"This razor is inexpensive, but it doesn't really cut it when it comes to shaving. My facial hair is not thick nor heavy, but this razor can't even do an adequate job. And, it is brutal. When I'm done shaving, which takes 5 or 10 minutes, my face feels like I have dry shaved it without any shaving cream. So, I would not recommend this razor for shaving. As a plus, the trimmer does work."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR....IF YOU HAVE NOT REACHED YOUR 16th BIRTHDAY AND WANT TO GET RID OF SOME PEACH FUZZ THIS RAZOR MIGHT WORK!!!!
1,Shave Pro,Worse electric shaver I have ever used. My face looked like it was cut by a carving knife.
5,Niiice.,Got this for the hubs for our anniversary. He used to shave his face about once a week (which blew for me--he didn't care obv.). After giving him this razor he shaves daily now. Wet or dry- its a common daily routine. Some reviews say that If you have sensitive skin to only do it wet--my husband has VERY sensitive skin and dry doesn't hurt him one bit. Excellent excellent deal.
2,Looks can be deceiving :(,I got my brother and two of my nephews one of these each and they all complained about how cheap made they are.
3,"Inexpensive, Shaves, but not quickly","I wear a beard, but shave my neck. I have to go over the same area again & again to get a decent shave"
4,Great product!,Purchased and installed on cab of 4WD compact tractor for use with rear-mounted snow blower.Blowing snow just melts on contact leaving rear view clear. Also works great in freezing rain/mist.
4,Great Historical Reference,This is a great pictorial reference book about the early history of Junction City. The photographs and narrative are both very interesting.
5,If you love Texas music....,"Being a two week old graduate of Texas Tech, I spent the last four years listening to Luke Olson play bars such as Texas Cafe as the Blue Light. If you love music such as Robert Earl Keen or Pat Green this is a must. Event though I am back in Dallas, all I have to do is put in this Cd, and I'm back in college and back in Lubbock. Love the West Texas Music!"
4,Very pleased with this bow.,"Here's the deal. I am an advanced beginner, 3 years of self taught learning by ear. I thought technique and practice practice practice were the only way to bust through a plateau. Guess what, BUY A DECENT BOW. This new bow arrived yesterday and what a difference! I am sooooooo happy! It's the difference between trying to write a letter with a crayon or a fine point pen. I have no idea if it has the value of a $200 bow, a $80 bow or what, the sweet sound I now get from my fiddle is priceless. I do know that a year ago, the improved quality of a new bow would've been lost on me. You do need to put the time in.The bow glides nicely on the strings with less effort. There is no scratchy sound like I had from my old $20 bow. This, together with a better grade of rosin have made a pleasant improvement."
1,this is NOT carbon fiber,"In fact, this is exactly the same bow marketed by this same vendor as ""String Centre FG"" bow for $50 less. FG standing for fiber glass. Now, at $28 the String Centre bow is a great deal (I've got one). But to market the exact same bow for $50 more and call it carbon fiber is in my opinion, a major rip-off. I sent it back (at my expense) and suffered a $4 ""restocking fee"". Bottom line: do not expect carbon fiber preformance from this overpriced fiberglass product."
3,funciona bien pero...,"funciona bien pero es un poco liviano para mi gusto, no quede satisfecho con las terminaciones del arco ni con el encrinado.recomendaria comprar uno de mejor calidad."
3,Lol,"Lol this movie is crap, but I like the old school powder riding! Some parts are funny and the IMAX cam got some awesome shots too..."
2,I've read better!,"I'm a big fan of Voyager and the Voyager novels, but this book really went NO WHERE! The crew flew around in a war for a while and then people got stuck in a shuttle craft. Same old stuff. The only memorable part was the description of the aliens at the end. My advice is to skip this one and read ""Marroned""!"
2,"Dumb, Dumber, Dumbest","When Nelix is the smartest banana in the bunch, you know you've got problems. After he repeatedly warns Janeway with everything but skywriting not to insert herself in a centuries-long conflict, she does anyway, certain she can talk them out of war using cookies and daisies. The crew follows along, figuring that they can talk two ancient enemies out of warring with each other. Naturally, members of the away team they are taken hostage and Voyager ends up killing hundreds of people to get away. Oh, there is some self-interest in a possible way home, but only the slightest bit.The best part, and the reason for two stars, at the end Nelix gets to tell them he told them so."
1,the worst,This is the worst voyager I have ever read. The crew was flat. The whole story made no sense. I could not even finish the book.
5,Great,Great product.Heavy duty and they look great in my 2002 VW Passat. They don't slide at all. I would definitely recommend them to anyone wishing to purchase them.
5,"Beautiful watch, excellent quality","I've had this watch for going on 8 years. Replaced the battery twice. It has never needed any maintenance, nor has it had the leaking issue others pointed out. Sadly, when I bought this watch, I paid close to list for it. I can only assume the price is so low because it's an older model now. I get tons of compliments on this watch. The face appears to be very scratch resistant as I've banged it on walls, counters, etc numerous times. Great deal!"
2,Interesting but boring.,"This book is painfully slow leaving me drifting off, reading pages only to have to re read them. It has an interesting story in their but it just failed to interest me at all."
2,"Difficult, plodding book","This is a historically-based tale of Gunnhild, a legendary Viking queen of the 10th century, and a sort of Livia of her day. She schemes and charms her way into a position of power as the wife of the King of Norway, then uses her magical talents to keep herself there and to support her husband and their children. She makes too many enemies, though, and most of her schemes come to naught.I was kind of disappointed in this book. The characters never came alive for me, and for most of the time I found myself plodding through the text, made more difficult by the Norse names and turns of phrase. Maybe I should go back and read Anderson's Tau Zero, of which I have fond memories."
3,Nice if you like soft,"After 3 days decompressing, the futon is still soft, very soft. It is ok for me since it is to lounge in the living room, and rarely, for a guest to sleep on. But if you want a firm futon, this is not the right one for you."
5,Very nice mattress,This is a nice mattress for the price. I would purchase it again. It is heavy so it will probably take two people if you are going to put a cover on it. I would suggest a plastic cover first if you have kids or pets who might mess it up. A regular Queen plastic cover fits it nice.It is very comfortable to sleep on. I've fallen asleep on it and I wake up thinking I'm in my own bed. My guests have also commented on how comfortable it is especially for a futon mattress.Well worth the money!
5,Awesome,"Great value for the purchase price. It seems very sturdy and is very comfortable. It came quickly by UPS, and was well-packaged. We do recommend careful removal of the packaging because it is vaccuum-packed. Our cats love it, too; we hardly see them anymore, because they're sleeping on it."
2,queen size airlay futon,"I bought this product because the existing mattress I had on my futon was droopy. It arrived on time, well boxed, and seemed fine, however it only took a week before this mattress, too, was floppy. Maybe that's just the nature of futon mattresses. I think I'm going to try bench cushions and see how they do."
3,Giardinelli Cardboard Music Stand,I purchased these for use in my home-I often have musicians come over to play. I also purchased them to use at work. They are used for holding the scores for my orff bells. They work o.k. I would like them to be larger with more durable cardboard so you could could place a heavier song book on it (we play hymns at home) or two pages of scores. It will hold 2 pages of 8/12 by 11 score pages-but they need to be mounted on a stiff cardboard backing. The portability and ability to fold and tuck away is handy....just need to be a tad larger. Of course one could use them as a rough template...
2,Tabs don't fit in the slots,"I have ordered these before and they are wonderful for the price and do last a long time considering they are cardboard. These however, did not fit together properly and several ripped as I was putting them together."
2,The Reason I Didn't Buy This Stand,"If you're not into style and good looks, than this music stand is for you! It's plain white colored cardboard stand (makes it easy to damage) with a musical note cut out in the middle. If you have a table to put it on while playing your instrument you're good to go. it's portable and not to mention recyclable!I didn't think it was that high of quality (which is why it's $1.00) and I need something to stand with and I'm not going to hold the stand up while playing. Sure it's portable but if you want to take it somewhere like in the park with you it could easily blow away. It's possible to spill water on it and damage it if it's cardboard and it might also be bent, torn, or broken easily depending on the thickness or thinness of the cardboard and the description doesn't tell how think the carboard is."
4,The Last Blue Plate Special was delicious!,"This book was a specialty of the house--well-crafted, hilarious, an interesting plot, good premise--and I couldn'tput it down.It was my dessert after doing boring tasks and otheressential things.Wish Abigail Padgett would keep writing this series."
1,NOT made in Germany- beware!,"Unlike the description of the product suggests, this product is not made in Germany. It's actually made in China, which is a big problem if you, like myself, don't buy made-in-China baby products."
3,Not what I expected,"The video is a nice video but it is too short. A portion of this video is a woman talking about how to play with your baby. I purchsed this video after reading a good review in one of my ""mommy magazines"". If the animal portion of the the video was longer it would be five stars. My sons likes it but we don't watch it often because I have to restart it so often and it is not enough time for me to get anything done around the house. The flash cards are a plus and makes me feel a little better about spending the money."
3,Great product except,"We have a bunch of dimmer switches that are over 20 years old and the knobs are cracking etc. I was hoping to replace them with these. The size, shape, and color match very well but the old knobs had some plastic pieces inside the piece that you attach to the dimmer that kept them on. This set only has a 1/4"" by 1/4"" open square so I need to create something to hold them to the dimmer switch. So the jury is out on this product."
3,It's not red!,I was really surprised to recieve this book and finding it brown! I ordered it specifically for that purpose but it looks almost like butcher paper that has been aged. It's construction is good and I will be using it - but I was disapointed that the image in the photo is vastly different from what you recieve.
5,Lone cowboy in a lonely world.,"This book definitely wins the I-can-write-like-Cormac-McCarthy contest. Filled with longing, discouragement, courage, and evocative imagery. The only thing missing is McCarthy's invented vocabulary. All that said, this unusual book places itself smack in the tradition of the lonesome cowboy not finding his happiness. Think Clint Eastwood with a wide open sensitive streak. If you long to get on a horse and wander out into the Western wilderness with only the sky and your equine companion, then hop on board this novel. It will evoke the hell out of every rocky crag and rippling stream along your way."
4,will last a long time,stainless steel and brass great product work well keep pump primed but i only use it 2 mounts out of the year
3,typed manuscript not paperback print,"the item I received was essentially a bound typed manuscript. typing is a little difficult to read but was darker than I had in ""letters of an elk hunt"". content of the book makes for wonderful reading."
2,I wasn't caught up in this book,"If I knew more about this book, I wouldn't have bought it, I would however check it out from a library..."
4,sounds like violence,"a great collection of songs from a very prolific band. since this is a group of recordings from different stages of the band, there are alot of styles and shifts represented on this cd. the first 3 songs arte from the very first 7"" and are some of my favorites....their is a very paranoid style of playing in these early recordings and it sounds great even now. the rest of the cd goes through other 7""s and some compilation tracks (of which Braid must have recorded around 7000 songs..hehe). it all comes full circle with the last 3 songs which were on the last Braid 7"" which showcase a more driving streamlined style. good stuff all around...but probably only recommended for fans of the band...not a good starting point for those curious about Braid."
5,Amazing retrospective view of prolific rock gods,"As of the time this review is being written the track listings on this sight are absolutely wrong. There are eighteen tracks on this cd-and each of them is dynamite. For any Braid fan this is a must buy. It is a chronological documentation of their 7-inches from the bands begginings to their demise and also one previously unreleased track. I had not heard much of their earlier stuff until I listened to this disc and I was suprised by the way they rocked in thier early years. The more recent songs on the disc are wonderful too. Loud, complicated, emotional, and beautifully convoluted are the words I could describe this album with."
4,you ain't have me! (thawah's hot!),"volume one is pretty damn good especially tracks 5, 8, 10 , 12, and 14. volume two isn't really worth purchasing unless you're big into covers. volume one is a definite winner a though...matt milla!"
5,Sweet Soul Music,"This is top knotch soul-lifting music - from the ""Sweet Soul Music"" of Arthur Conley (an homage to the Kings and Queens of Soul) to James Brown's enthusiastic anthem, ""I Got You (I Feel Good)."" This is the perfect intro to soul music classics and great for anyone starting a collection. Personal fave's include: The sweet ""Oogum Boogum Song"", ""Green Onions"" by Booker T. & The M.G.'s and the wonderful ""You've Really Got A Hold On Me"". A must for ""Big Chill"" fans."
5,Outstanding Book - Highly recommended!,"I received this book as a gift several years ago and I never tire of looking at the great photos and reading the comments over and over. I claim to be a Virginian by birth on my mother's side. I was born a few miles across the border in Kentucky, but am a Virginian through and through as I have lived most of my life (since 1942 - age 8) in its great capitol, Richmond. I would highly recommend this book to any Virginian (or non-Virginian) who calls Virginia home and loves this great commonwealth. If you are collecting the ""On My Mind"" series don't miss this one."
1,Pure cant,"What on earth is this? Is this book a joke? Or was Kant joking? And who is Peter Fenves, anyway?The dense, impenetrable prose of his book makes it down right impossible to read, and it's never clear what Fenves' central thesis might be. Perhaps he wants to become the court jester of pure cant.The joke is on the reader, I'm afraid."
5,"strange concept, but irresistable","When I first saw this video, I thought 'the cheek of Viz', but then on second thoughts, it was a pretty good idea. It's a must for any anime turned JPOP fan I can assure you. The music is somewhat dated, but that hardly matters to any fans.Each sequence is a 'music video' of the opening and closing credits. The bonus is that the animation is not disturbed by credits. This being said, I found it disappointing that the lyrics were not subtitled.I think this video will really only appeal to the Ranma fan who also enjoys JPOP. Only the will see real value in this video. I don't think it really appeals to the just a Ranma or just a JPOP fan."
3,Glad yet dissapointed,To be honest I was kind of dissapointed when I got this video. I thought it was a collection of music videos from the ova/oav series. I guess I should've done more research. Oh well at least it's part of my Ranma 1/2 collection.
4,"good, but not TOO good....",The ranma 1/2 video jukebox is good for the ranma fans that liked the sonds from the series...i was disapointed from it because there are no subtitles or the song lyrics and the OVA songs are not included...thanks
2,Mr. Incredible Muscle Child Costume,"The size seemed correct and once worn, the costume made quite an impression (from far away it looked great). My son was very excited about the muscles. The quality however wasn't very good. The mask was made with cheep foam as was much of the rest of it. After one wear it showed major signs of wear. The costume is so spectacular in the movie, what we got as an actual costume was a real let-down, typical made in China product."
2,Too uncomfortable for my 4 year old boy.,"When I first saw it I thought it was going to be a good one, but once I tried it on my son, it was too big, too stiff that he didnt want to use it.. It is back to the package and i guess he wont use it again."
3,As good as you get for a costume purchase...,"Like other costumes, this one seems designed to last a day or so on Haloween and then totally fall apart the next day. My son loves it, though. It's thin nylon fabric and poor stitching are already ripping after a month of 4 year old abuse, but that's pretty much what we expect out of a purchased costume. It doesn't seem like you can buy a good quality costume for licensed characters...your child will be happy, but you may find yourself trying to mend rips after a while."
4,Love the tea...but still havent received my shipment!!,"I ordered this on june 8th. It is June 25th and my order has yet to ship. I emailed Amazon last week and received a generic answer about shipping times. Come on.....this is taking way too long to send out teabags. It has already been 2 1/2 weeks. So much for ""ships in 24 hours""."
1,Not so great,The tea is not that great. it kinda tastes like lemonade mixed with regular tea (duh) and that makes it taaste like crraaaap. totally don't recommend. i hated it so much that i made a review on amazon lmfao
3,One of the first alternate tales...,Out of Evangelion. It's a retelling of the small part of the last episode of the '93 tv show that only deals with teen angst and typical love triangles.
5,A must read for Evangelion fans,"This is a wonderful alternate take on Evangelion. My only regret is I wish the volumes were a little quicker on release, but you can't have everything. ;)"
5,Recommended!!!!!!!,If you like Egyptian Style belly dance music this cd is for you. All songs daneable. Very nice version of Zeina. A sweet 2 minute Tablu Solo. Excellant Saidi number.
4,Belly dancing Music,Arrived on time and the music is great for Belly dancing. Veena and Neena also have great You Tube Videos. Love it!
4,uplifts heart & mind!,"His books are big & bold with pictures perfect for coloring, & simple poetry, easy for children to understand & enjoy while their fingers are absorbed with their magic markers or crayons.Excellent for school & daycare libraries, hospitals & clinics, camps & churches, support groups & families to promote learning & communicating about kids' health."
1,The SAME as Volume 1,"An MSRP of $65 is insulting for a program (while absolutly great) that has single track mono sound and a direct video transfer with no touch-up work done to restore artwork that is 20 years old. Volume 1, episode one, had a minor glitch at the 3:15 marker with an overall terrible transfer, and episode two had no soundtrack... Volume 2 looks to be as haphazardly thrown together, which is an absolute shame for such a great show!"
1,Thundercats season1 vol2.,"The Thundercats season1 vol1 boxset was a dissaster, every person that bought it will tell you that, I still dont know how people managed to write wrong reviews about the pack, i think they didnt even buy it and they just write a review because they are boring?.The video was not remastered and was full of flaws.The audio was just MONO.Music track was missing in one episode.The extras were an insult!The box was fine but inside there was nothing, just a small paper saying ""buy season2 in december"" (that was very lame comming from a mega company like warner)they should learn how to release dvds, like the company called BCI did, with the HE-MAN pack, thats an example of how to treat consumers.Warner till now has NOT replaced DVD1."
4,Another strange thing...,"Did anyone notice that in Season One /Volume Two - that the episodes seemed out of order? I remember the ""Trial"" episodes being in order, yet they are in this set spread one episode per disk."
5,Childhood memories,"fantastic, brings back child hood memories, you can't get in UK, EXCELLENT quality"
1,Poor quality,This was a poor video... It was like you held up your cellphone to the tv and videoed it and then put it on a DVD.. It was really grainy and sound was poor also
4,Thundercats!!!!,Put a smile on my 10 year olds face ! That counts a lot for me! He is happy that makes mom happy.
4,Thundercats,The delivery was really quick to me in Australia and the quality of the DVD is great. I am very happy with the service and product.
4,Works good but lacking documentation,"I bought this to remove the 2 screws holding down my brake rotors. The impact driver comes in a nice case, but there was no instruction manual of any kind. I had a hard time understanding how to change the configuration to work clockwise or counterclockwise, but I figured it out after 5 minutes of playing with it. You have to remove the bit holder, push in the head, then twist it one way or the other depending on which config you want. You can test it by pushing the tip against the floor to see which way the head turns."
2,Disappointed in quality of bits with this tool,"I attempted to remove the two screws on my Honda XL-250 points/condenser cover with my K-D 1140 impact driver set. I used the smaller Phillips bit, and got the first screw loosened, but the second one twisted the tip of the Phillips bit off. Don't know what kind of steel was used in the manufacture of the bits, but it is obviously very soft. How unfortunate. I won't be purchasing the replacement bit set. ""Hit me once, shame on you. Hit me twice, shame on me!""Randy YoungBattle Ground IN"
1,Trucco lip Gloss,"Not the product as listed , or depicted , called got the run around , ??I suggest if you want Baby Doll , go elsewhere....""Thumbs Down Company"""
3,An okay book. Not one of the best but good.,A book where the Enterprise is thrown back in time and incounter an alien Earth lost in time where they find dinosaur like beings that attack the Enterprise crew. A pretty good book but i wouldn't consider it one of the best.
4,A very entertaining Star Trek adventure,"In First Frontier, Diane Carey and Dr. James I. Kirkland have created a novel that succeeds on a variety of levels. The plot about an alien species' attempt to better itself at the sake of humanity is highly original, and contains several intriguing twists. Also, the inclusion of dinosaurs and prehistoric Earth as a major plot device is both enlightening and entertaining. The story is also strengthened by many exciting action sequences, and great detail is given into defining the characters. With its abundance of action and great storyline, First Frontier is Star Trek at its best."
1,A very pendantic book,Carey has written several good Star Trek books. First Frontier is not one of them. She uses the book to preach that anyone who disagrees with the concept of the Federation should be treated as unruly children. I felt that she was trying to apply this to the UN. She really went to town in her efforts to espouse evolution as fact instead of theory. This I found offensive.
3,Typical Diane Carey.,"As usual, Diane Carey tells a fascinating story, with excellent plot, characterization, and pacing. Unfortunately, also as usual, Diane Carey tries overhard to be a ""wordsmith"", making continuous attempts to use words in clever and unusual ways, and failing miserably at it. Her word choice is distractingly odd and frequently just wrong. She has a near-pathological aversion to the phrase ""he said"", using such replacements as ""he bolted"" (while not moving), and ""He appraised"", as well as many more; I could fill a page and more with odd word choices that she makes in an attempt to avoid commonplace phrases. Mind you, I understand the desire to avoid repetitive use of common phrases, but Ms. Carey has a real tendancy to go so overboard in the attempt, and has so little talent for doing it fluently, that it is truly distracting and makes it hard to focus on the story, which is actually a very well-conceived and fascinating story that I would have liked to see better-told."
4,What a storyteller!,"I always enjoy the way this gal spins a tale! The story's format is the highly recognizable one used in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" -- what if the human race (and by extention, the Federation) never existed?While I find evolutionary theory unbelievably improbable, so is science fiction -- and they fit! I thoroughly recommend this page-turner and the author for her writing skills."
3,Quality has plunged; little better than from the Dollar Store,"I have another Bianchi 1 1/4"" belt purchased in 2001. I use it to support a 22 oz. J-frame. I gained a little weight so ordered a size up. The new one is flimsy in comparison to the first one. I noticed the new one is made in Mexico, FWIW, and the original was made in the USA."
1,Not a gun belt!!!,"As a major manufacturer of gun belts, holsters, and accessories, I believe this would a sound purchase. This was not the case. It was an inferior produce that only serves as a casual belt. I would recommend the GALCO product as they are all designed to support the wear and carry of a full-size 1911 which is usually the largest carry gun most commonly found."
1,Shameful pandering to sensationalist stereotypes,A sensationalistic novel pandering to stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims gets more promotion and reviews than a dozen true-life reflections of Arab and Arab-American life. There have been more fictional presentations of kidnapped women running away from tyrannical Muslim husbands then there are Muslim women on planet earth. No doubt the violent sexism of a traditional society is a subject for drama and study. But the author is a disgrace for pandering to the worst in American and European ignorance about Arabs and Islam.
3,its a book,Nothing special. Just a cardboard cover with pages. Careful; when it says not real leather.... it doesn't mean it is fake leather... It is just leather print on cardboard
3,Color is off,"It's not red, like the picture makes it seem. It's a light tan, brown color. It doesn't say in the description that the picture is not the right color."
5,Top Shelf,"I am telling all of my friends who are remotely acquainted with the Great Lakes to find a copy. It's historical and it's magical. Well edited and full of delight and inspiration. My favorite story is of the newlywed couple floating through a fairyland of shallows which are now long gone, near the St. Claire flats - a green and blue land where there is no land, only water, reeds, lilies, dragonflies and a scattered island here and there holding the odd humans who make it home."
5,The Women's Great Lakes Reader,"Using diaries, log books, letters, and other narratives, the editor has woven an anthology of women and their stories about life on the Great Lakes from the late 1700s until the present day. There is also a strong emphasis on the Native American women's accounts of their lives and activities. Of special interest to me were the accounts of women lighthouse keepers and women who worked on the ships that navigate the Great Lakes. This book is highly recommended to anyone with an interest in women's literature and/or the Great Lakes."
2,"Get the first, skip this one...","That pretty much says it all. These guys' first album was flat out, ..., fried-chicken, coffee like motor oil, nitro-burnin' rock and roll. It is possibly one of the best albums in this style that has yet to be released (no, Donnas, you don't get that award). Even better than the finest efforts of the Hellacopters. Get it, get it, get it, even if you have to be a corporate sellout and buy the cd on the major label. (Those who remember, this lp first came out on the indie label ...)This cd, this is a mockery of what these guys are. Kind of like what Danzig has become compared to his Misfits (or even Samhain) days. It's a joke of itself and it doesn't come off well at all.Also, if you really want to dig and get into this vibe. Check out any of the releases by Nine Pound Hammer...that's who these guys were (essentially) before shifting a couple of members and taking on this name.Enjoy kiddies. But know that you can sleep easy if you don't buy this one."
1,Best Comedy CD of the Year!,"These guys are the funniest group of musicians to ever strap on a guitar, and put a few half naked babes on the cover of a CD.Working with zero talent, and the IQ of a groundhog, Nashville Pussy has somehow managed to put together one of the flat out, funniest CDs I have ever heard.If you have never heard Nashville Pussy's music, think Jackyl, minus all the talent.Look at the cover of the CD and you get a fairly good idea what these guys are about. Read the song titles, and you can be reasonably sure you know what's coming. Listen to the disc, and find out just how right you were. Pure, unadulterated, slop.If you love songs based entirely on three chords, and lyrics that attempt, but fail, to be outrageous, this is the band for you...."
1,The Used Music Store Won't Buy it Back,"Not that I blame them I guess. This CD is just awful. They can't sing or play instruments, and they definitely can't write tunes. You should stick with the classics, this group is a waste of time."
1,"Well, they suck","Not much more one can say here. This is a pathetic excuse for music - they obviously placed more emphasis on their shocking names and song titles and half-naked women appearing on the cover than they did on music. But, perhaps that's due to a complete lack of talent. Hard rock fans would find their money better spent on recordings by the masters, not these excuses for musicians."
1,Yechh,"What a load of crap. This is without a doubt the worst cd I have ever purchased. Are these guys for real? Better yet, are the critics who compare them to AC/DC an Skynrd for real? This stuff is just bad music. I haven't been able to give this CD away."
3,What happens when the party is over,"You're fat, bald with a headache and a hangover but, at least you kicked ass at the party. All the songs sound the same. Cool for a once through."
4,Not for beginners,"The Doctor is in the house. My thoughts echo those of the guys who wrote about the next lesson/volume: this stuff is brilliant AND complicated. I've been hammering out a basic blues/boogie riff for probably +/-50 years with not a single tune attached. Just exercising the fingers in the same blues keys the Doctor uses in this lesson. OK, hands apart! Work those bass lines til your left hand aches, then try learning just a few signature right-hand riffs. Don't worry about putting left and right together anytime soon unless you're already there. Point is, this is THE stuff from THE Master and it will help you immensely if you don't let the complexity and the fact that he doesn't break it down completely GET YOU DOWN. Buy this and have hours of fun playing with Doc J. He and Leon Russell have kept this genre of great piano music alive. Bless they hearts!"
5,a brilliant insite into the world of a hitman,I couldnt put this book down. Brilliantly written. This book made me feel I was living the life of the hitman (malcom Deakin). I was totally stoked on how graphic and detailed it was.I'd definately read it again.definately one of clarksons best fictional books.
5,Wonderful family favorite kids' book,"I used to read this book, from the library, with my kids every year around Thanksgiving time. Now that my kids are in college I decided to buy it to read aloud when they come home. I know, corny. But none of us is above a little nostalgic holiday reading. It's a wonderful, spunky tale, appropriate for the season. We also like the illustrations. I recommend it!"
5,out of print :( but a great story if you can find it.,"We got this story because it goes along with the FIAR curriculum we will be doing next school year. It is a good story about not judging a book by it's cover. We have loved it. I think there may be others in the series, not sure if they are out of print as well."
2,"Cute Movie, Extremely poor Dvd Quality","If you don't really watch the movie and just listen to the music, it's fine. Unfortunately, the film and the voices are not insync. If I were to ""make a wish"" on this one, it would be for a better quality DVD."
5,Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Now this is good music. There is not a single song hear that is even close to being poor. It's fast, powerful, melodic, catchy as hell and in my opinion is the best album of 2003.Victor Smolski is completely amazing on guitar, Peavey Wagner is a genius songwriter with a very melodic, unique voice and Mike Terrana is a powerful drummer.I can't speak highly enough of this album. For what it is, it's almost perfect, and what is it? I guess you'd call it a cross between power metal and thrash. It's a bit thrashier than their privious album, Unity, and about on par with it as far as quality is concerned and that's a good thing because Unity was awesome.Just buy it."
4,you can't go wrong,This album rocks pure and simple. Its as good if not better than The Missing Link. I wish the new Iced Earth was as good as this record. This is power metal at its best. Peavy has a very unique voice and he is in top form here. The guitar sound is awesome and the drums kick butt. There is not one bad song on this thing it rocks start to finish no filler all killer. If you never heard Rage before buy this. Its way better than anything Iron Maiden has done in a long time.
3,"Excellent story, less than excellent book quality","This is an excellent story. I've been waiting twenty years for Longyear's books to be reprinted so I was really excited to buy this book and the other ones in the series. For those of you who are simply interested in reading an amazing story I strongly recommend this book. For those of you who like your books to be in pristine condition be warned. After one month the covers on all the books I've purchased from Backinprint.com have curled back and now after 6 months the plastic coating on the covers is starting to peel off as well. Oh, and did I mention the typographically errors?"
4,As always... Incendiary,A truly masterful piece of storytelling until you realise that it's all true... Then the depth and scope of this book hits you head on! Magnificent.
5,Things that should be common sense,"It's aggravating, in a way, to come across a book that says basically what you've thought for a while, but in an unformed way. ""Manufacturing Consent"" should be required reading in journalism and communications school."
3,We get the point.,"I'm sure Chomsky & Herman have made an excellent case, but after the characteristics of their propaganda model have been defined in the first chapter, the next three hundred pages become a tiresome list of examples illustrating their point. The numbing predictability this produced meant that I was unable to finish the book. It does not help either that the book was written in such dessicated prose. It illustrates an important point and it's some feat of research, but it's a pity it's so dull."
3,Eh...,"Book does not match the picture in the order. I got a different version then all of my classmates, which is a bit frustrating. Content appears to be the same, but my cover and size of the book is different then what I thought I was going to get."
4,"""[A]rguably the most important intellectual alive""","A modern classic in political science, Manufacturing Consent does a thorough job presenting a case against journalistic objectivity. With a hefty amount of scholarship and clarity, Chomsky (""arguably the most important intellectual alive"", according to the New York Times) and Herman illustrate the incentive structures of the mass media (their analysis was published before the popularization of the internet) and how such structures lead to collusion between the press and government. In other words, many of us are unwitting victims of government proganda aimed at maintaining the existing power structure. As much as it sounds like a conspiricy theory, don't dismiss it until you have read it. Chomsky and Herman present a compelling propaganda model that, while you may not agree with the conslusions completely, may give you further insight into the machinations of the democracy that we are all live in."
3,Beware: Out of date facts,"Beware: Even the new 2002 edition uses out-of-date facts. It seems the only ""updating"" the authors did from their original 1988 edition was a brief introduction with some new developments and facts. The main body of the book has completely useless charts and tables such as ""Wealth of the Control Groups of 24 Large Media Corporations, February 1986."" Media conglomeration has proliferated so much in the last nineteen years that these numbers are meaningless. There are only 5 or 6 major media companies left nowadays."
1,More conspiracy theory propaganda,Wake up and understand who controls the media and who they vote for. Why would these Dem voting owners and employees possibly push a Republican Agenda? Can you possibly answer that?What about Dan Rather trying to subvert an upcoming election with false reporting prior to an election and yet he was supported by his media outlet until the whithering fire from other outlets forced him to admit the story was false.
1,Do NOT buy these batteries,"I have purchased non-Canon batteries in the past and they've worked well. Not so with these. From day one, they have not held a charge. Incredibly, I noticed as I was packing for a trip that they weigh a fraction of what the Canon batteries weigh. You can squeeze them and compress them with your fingers, which of course is impossible with a proper battery. Clearly they are skimping on the substrate. They will leave you angry and ripped off. They are completely useless."
1,This battery won't recharge,The battery comes pre-charge for the 1st use. But it won't recharge with my Cannon G2 factory charger. I bought the double pack incase one of them decide not to come back. Both of them decided not to come back. It's a POS. thanks for reading. try out the Lenmar(DLC 511) see what you think.
2,Cannon replacement battery,"Well obviously since I just bought battery I can't comment on lifetime or quality yet.However I have a cautionary story. When I ordered my Cannon EOS 40D from some website in NY or NJ I asked for a second battery. I was charged $[...] for a second battery but it was THIS one not a real Cannon battery, so the guy screwed me by sending me a $[...] battery and charging me full Cannon price.The Cannon battery is still going strong after 2+ years the ""non-Cannon"" battery lasted about a year. For less than $[...] bucks that's OK. Just DON'T let it sit discharged for long periods of time."
5,Great performance of inspired Roslavets works,"This CD shows to sides to Nikolaj Roslavets' work. The symphonic poem 'Chasy Novoluniya' owes a lot to Scriabin's later symphonic poems (and also uses his chord system) but it is an enjoyable piece nonetheless. The violin concerto, here performed in exemplary fashion by Gridenko and Holliger, shows much more inspiration and originality than this composer is usually given credit for. It is a powerful work which shows a more mature side of Roslavets, betraying influences from Honegger and maybe Hindemith. It is unfortunate that so many of Roslavets' works were destroyed, since this disc shows the great promise cut short by both an unfriendly government and a musical tradition hostile to this sort of 'scriabinism'."
3,A. B. Simpson,I found this a dry read informative read then history is often dry and very difficult to present otherwise. However the material was accurate comparing it to other scholarly material on A. B. Simpson.
2,Dull and pointless,"If you have never heard anything by Korn, Soulfly, Limp Bizkit, Downset, Deftones, System of a down, Biohazard, Machine Head or Slipknot then this is the most original album ever. If you have heard these bands, then expect something very familiar. For those into safe, unoriginal, boring bands only."
4,Fran Fran Fran!,"There's know one like her, and if you like the nanny, you will love this even better. A very sweet and up comming modernization of a cinderella story. Except, instead of leaving behind a slipper, in the end she leaves an entire country pining for her. A wonderful light love story filled with humor and laughs abound. And youv'e got to see her chicken!"
3,"Fairly satisfying for a rainy, stay-at-home night.","If you're a Dalton fan, you'll find this movie a little less than satisfying simply because it is a comedy. Timothy Dalton is made for serious drama with his voice, stunning screne presence and talent. This doesn't rule out his ability to do comedy..it's just more of a ""Fran"" thing and it's her movie all the way. There are some good laughs, but the ending leaves you wanting just a little more."
4,Enjoyable Comedy,"I can't say that I have been a fan of Fran Drescher, mainly because I never watched any of her TV shows. However, she does very good job in the role of a New York City beautician who is mistakenly recruited as a teacher for the children of an eastern European dictator played by Timothy Dalton.Much of Drescher's comedy is geared around, believe it or not, her voice. It has an Elmer Fudd quality to it--especially when she laughs.Drescher goes with the flow in attempting to teach Dalton's four children, but goes well beyond the three Rs--much to his consternation. Still, her down to earth style slowly wins Dalton's heart and transforms into something of a more acceptable world leader.While the ending is predictable, it is nonetheless satisfying."
3,Entertaining,This movie is predictable but it's an entertaining movie for the family. Fran Drescher has a really hot bod.
3,The King And I is redone,"Fran Drescher is a beauty school teacher transplanted to Slavic Europe in Anna and the King of Slavitsky, or Beautician and the Beast, whatever they decided to name it, an obvious knockoff of The King And I. He's a power monger, she's a bright American who softens and civilizes him. Very comforting to the American ego. Some of the movie is funny, some is stupid, some is boring, and it has the big emotional ending."
4,Romance for the whole family,"This movie should be viewed for what it is - a sweet, simple romance that asks nothing of it's viewer but offers plenty in return. Non-fans of Fran can't really expect to enjoy it, as it is very much her movie, but she carries it brilliantly. Laughs are aplenty and the romance is kept at a sweet, innocent level. You can't help but be drawn in - it's certainly one to watch time and time again."
5,Very Good Movie,I really love this movie!! Timothy Dalton and Fran Drescher are great together!! I have to say OMG for Timothy Dalton!!!! He's one of my favorite actors!!
5,fran drescher fan!,"although it is close to the series, it still is a great movie and fran drescher is fantastic, and she always looks great.we need to have her in more romantic comedies."
5,Great Movie,"This movie is really good. There were some similarity from ""The Nanny"" but still the movie was great. If you like Fran Drescher or ""The Nanny"" then you should definitely check this movie out because you will enjoy it."
2,no as good as the last.....boring!!!!,"these girls have no talent show....and are not on the road. what your going to get is basic photo shoots , very lame!"
5,Fun and Inspiring,"First of all: Suicide Girls are beyond hot!!I also have the first Suicide Girls DVD (The First Tour), and this DVD ist quiet different from the first.This is not a ""stage- and/or backstage"" film (as the first dvd), but a ""travel"" film.The landscape is very nice, but this is not the most important thing here. It is just a ""geographical reference"".On this DVD every girl gets her own segment, and a ""video-photo-shooting"". VERY NICE shooting.It's also funny, nice, and more ""quiet"" as the first SC-DVD, but better than ""the first tour DVD"".And please, this is not a girl-girl action movie (if you are looking for it), but a movie about that 20 or so hot girls naked in tuscany.And the girls are amazing.The second thing: the audio and VIDEO quality is top! I love it!The soundtrack is also a positive point on this DVD."
1,Disapointing,"I brought this video for my husband for Christmas, and he said he didn't like it one bit. I brought it for him because he saw one of their other videos and liked it but he didn't like this at all! It was a horrible gift I gave him!"
5,Another Suicide Girls success,"This is a fantastic movie. It's a bit more obscure then their first movie, but it is still a great choice for the Suicide Girls fan in your life."
3,Saving nu metal in 2003,"Decent CD.However,it misses the 'spark' which their previous CD 'Satellite' seemed to show. There could have been more of the hip-hop vibe they showed on the first two albums also. Nevertheless, P.O.D. have returned with a good record which can be compared to this year's good releases (such as Metallica's St Anger)and this year's disasters (i won't mention any names!)The metal and reggae in the band's sound remains at its peak, as well as its enthusiasm and belief, even though one of the original members has left. Songs such as 'Wildfire' and 'Change the World' bring out their strong beliefs, and the track 'Execute the Sounds' brings back the feel-good factor from songs such as 'Freestyle' from the first album and 'Boom' from the second. P.O.D. are back, and they have the potential to show the world what they can do."
1,So long,"Why anyone gives a crap about P.O.D. is shocking to me.Satellite was awesome and this record is just lame. The whole Jamican accent is really bad and I on;y wish I could get my 16 bucks back on this record. If you need to buy a P.O.D. record buy Satellite, and stay far away from this crap."
2,This is a step down,"I had high hopes when buying this cd, i hear ""will you"" and loved it. but the rest of the cd is bland. You are able to hear the diffrence with the new guitar player, but he is much worse. the guitar in this cd does not change much, its noit dynamic at all. the vocals are ok, but nothing like they used to be. one song i was impressed with was the last one, ""eternal"" it actually has very good guitar playing, as it should because its an instrumental. the ironic thing is that this is a song which features a guest guitarist which im sure did alot of the song himself. the only reason this cd didnt get a 1 is because of the songs ""will you"" and ""eternal."" this cd could have been so much better."
1,Im blown away,"I'm the last person in the world to pick up a rock/punkish/whatever cd, but something told me to pick it up and ever since that day, I have not been able to put it down. It good enough for me to pick up their older albums.If you never heard them before, I advise you to pick up this album."
5,P.O.D. rocks!,"Payable on Death rocks. It's an awesome album.My favorite song would have to be ""Find My Way"" and ""The Reasons"". P.O.D. rocks! I saw them along with Linkin Park,Story of the Year, and Hoobastank in concert. They rocked!!!Me and my boyfriend are huge, huge fans of them. The only reason he went to the concert was to see them and if they weren't there, he wouldn't have went.I went to see all of them. P.O.D deserves 5 stars.P.S. Sonny is so sexy!!(don't ya'll agree?)"
2,Beat The Horse Bloody...,"I've read this over & over again on other Amazon reviews and I hate to beat a horse bloody, BUT why are all the newer rock bands, Staind, POD, Limp Bizkit, making these slow ballet albums. Stick with what you know, hard drums, hard guitar, and hard lyrics.Take Linkin Park for example. They stick with the same format with their latest album and it rocks. Check out Amazon's top 100 sellers and you can always find that album.The only POD like songs on this album is 'Will You' and Asthema. They sound like the POD I know and LOVE. I was expecting ROCK but got Easy Listening.Lets hope Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots new releases next week don't ballet out..."
1,my god POD does it again?,"This album is really bad I don't like it for nothing trying to be all the reggea, hard rock band it's just not working for them don't get this album for nothing"
2,WORST P.O.D. ALBUM EVER,"I've been down with P.O.D since Warriors EP in 1997. They've released some AWESOME stuff over their time BUT I can't believe people rated this CD with 5 out of 5 stars! This is a horrible album - Will You is by far the best track, but it's doesn't touch The Southtown, Alive, Satellite...etc (the list goes on) Satellite is FAR superior to this album! Infact, it's so superior, it's like a totally different band recorded it. Marcos [leaving/getting kicked out] sure has taken it's toll. This self-titled album is like an album of b-sides! Hopefully their next album with Jason will deserve a 5 out of 5 star rating. Until then, I suggest you spend you money on their previous albums: Satellite, then Fundamental Elements."
2,Highly Disappointing!,"If you're a fan of old-school P.O.D., this album is probably not for you. Since their last release, the boys from the big S.D. booted their long-time guitar player, Marcos Curiel, for unclear reasons. Despite adding Jason Truby of Living Sacrifice fame, they fail to create anything fresh or exciting on this highly disappointing release.P.O.D. is notorious for evolving their sound from each album to the next and their ability to mix various musical genres. However, without Curiel, P.O.D. has lost much of their hardcore punk and Latin influences. What remains is positive radio-rock, some rap, and a lot of cheese-ball pseudo-reggae. The result is a recording that sounds a lot more like 311 and Pax 217 than P.O.D., yet lacks any sense of maturity, energy or direction.Hopefully Jason Truby will find his voice in P.O.D. by their next release and bring some of his metal background to the table."
4,Better than you think,"Ok, Let me clear something up. If you're just looking for something to rattle your bearly-there brain against your hard head, you will be disapointed. If you really like P.O.D. for there musical talent and style, you will love almost all the songs on this CD. Track 12 (Eternal) is the only ""non P.O.D."" song on this CD."
3,Good,"It is a good CD, but a far cry from POD's previous album, Satellite. The songs are good, but seem less creative than the songs on Satellite or The Fundamental Elements of Southtown. The songs could easily be better if they would branch out a bit and add some more elements to the songs - It almost sounds like they rushed to finish recording and they wrote and recorded everything in like a day. There are some clear cut radio hits (Execute the Sounds, Change The World, Finding My Way) and some filler songs (I and Identify, Wildfire). But it is a pretty good CD, but not the best from them. On a scale of 1 to 10:1) Wildfire - 5/102) Will You - 7/103) Change the World - 9/104) Execute the Sounds - 9/105) Find My Way - 9/106) Revolution - 6/107) The Reasons - 7/108) Freedom Fighters - 7/109) Waiting on Today - 8/1010) I and Identify - 5/1011) Asthsma - 8/1012 Eternal - 9/10"
4,"Very Different, But still alright.","I have been a fan of P.O.D for a while, and recently bought this C.D. off the knowlege alone that the last four albums were pretty good.(My faveorite is Brown)I have very mixed feelings about this album. On one hand, as a P.O.D C.D., I'ts pretty mediocre. However, as an album alone, It's good. this album is very different than all other albums. This is probably due to the fact that the old guitarist left, replaced by Trubee. I'ts Not, by a long shot, a good P.O.D album, but standing alone, is worth the fifteen dollars.(but why is the DVD for PS2 only? why not Xbox?)"
3,"Great, but not so great","I'm a big P.O.D. fan. When I saw this album I quickly purchased it, believing it to be close to their cd Satelite. It was much different. Half the tracks are pretty good, the other half I don't really enjoy. It's gets a little stale throughout the cd. On the other hand, some tracks are awesome."
2,To Jah,"First, i was reading through the 'Reviews' and i read a little thing written by Daniel saying ""Jah is hebrew for God"" and well i just think that it is a very dumb thing to say... ""Jah,"" which was actually the word used for God by the originators of reggae music. , you know... the Jamaicans, SORRY DANIEL(thats why the word is used)! Not Sonny, even though he tried hard to sound like he was(Jamaican).P.O.D. disapointed me alot this time around... srry. Buy P.O.D. greatness: Fundemental Elements of South Town / Brown / Satelite... Why not all 3?! Pretty much everything P.O.D. has done before this...Asthma, Will You, Space, and Change the world; They can hang, but BARELY !!!! Maybe even Revolution, if i listen to it alittle more..."
3,Good but not was I was expecting,"I really loved satellite and every song on it(except 1) and it was really good, but this CD doenst come close to how great satelite was. After hearing sleeping awake, I really was expecting this band to get even better with the new guitarist,but I think I liked the old one better. The only songs that sound like the old POD are my 2 favorites will you and Asthma. The other good songs are Change The World and Waiting On Today. Eternal is pretty good too. All in all I think they should go back to their old style becuz most fans seem dissapointed, including me."
4,A Fan of the Heavy,While I appreciate the heavier style that POD is known for this album does bring a fresh reggae feel to an approachable metal.
2,Still there but only not,This album has left me wanting. POD has not shown the same energy and heavyness here than when folks got to know them. Nothing against growing artisticly and exploring new horizons but this album has simply set my sights firmly on other bands from now on....
4,P.O.D. at there best,"Its about ... time this cd finally came out.Now, you see, im a P.O.D. fan and the only complaint i have for this cd is that i miss the amazing rapping from sonny.Dont get me wrong, some of its there but its more of a rock thing which sounds great too.Believe me, if your a pod fan you will definetly want this album. JUst dont expect any tracks similar to ""youth of the nation"" or ""set it off"" which have mostly rap verses which sound great. But i guess i have been spoiled by linkin park's style. But on payable on death, which is the name of the group, has wonderful tracks such as ""Execute the sounds"" and ""Revolution"" (which has nothing to do with the matrix) which i believe are the best on the album. If your still not sure go to the website www.payableondeath.com so lease dont send me any hate to me for comparing pod to linkin park, i was just making a point. peaceout."
4,"good follow up to their classic ""Satellite"" - 4.5 stars","The four man SD team came back again with a good album and another solid performance. Doesn't have the classic tracks that ""Satellite"" had but has a good amount of quality songs, slacks off after number 8 (where I usually change the cd) keeping it from a 5 star rating. Still is a must have cd.#1 - 8#2 - 9.5#3 - 8#4 - 9.5#5 - 8.5#6 - 9#7 - 9#8 - 9.5#9 - 6#10 - 5#11 - 4#12 - 3Check all my reviews"
1,HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT,"I expected alot more from this album. I thought the band would be better with truby since the first song they did was for the matrix, that song was unbelievable. So, I was expecting an awesome album. When I heard the song ""will you"" I thought it was ok and it grew on me. It turns out that when I got the cd, ""Will You"" was the best song on the album. That was just a decent song. I was crushed. POD is my favorite band. If you liked their other cds then dont get this one. Unless you want to pay 11 bucks for 1 good song."
5,Best (Sale Priced) C.D I've Ever Bought...,"I saw this on sale at Target for 10.98 and decided to give it a listen. I'd never really been into P.O.D before, but i figured the song ""Wildfire"" was good, so I might as well check it out. It's grown on me sooo much since then, I listen to it atleast 3 times a week THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH. Favorites include: Track 4 (Execute the Ground) and Track 6 (Revolution), but there all worth 5 stars..."
5,P.O.D hit the spot,Whe listening to P.O.D. tears came to my eyes for their words are so awe inspiring thy made me see the light and I am on the road to a better understaanding of who I am because of them. If the read this I would Like to say thank you.
1,WOW,"This album has to be the worst album that i have ever had the displeasure to listen to. In the first single ""Will You"" the singer displays an annoying whiny screech. And the rest of the album is more of the same. I also hate the reggae sh*t they put in their music. At times on this album P.O.D show signs of brilliance, but for the most part this album is awful."
3,Ehh,"When I first heard these guyses new single, will you, I was so so stoked to get it! So my bro went out and bought it for me and when I was listening to it, I was a little dissapointed, It is much different from their old stuff but it isn't that bad! There are a few songs that are pretty cetchy but It didn't impress me much!"
1,worst pod cd to date,"It looks like the departure of POD guitarist Marcus left the band with no where to go but downhill. I really thought the band was coming together musically with the release of Satellite. Without a doubt, Satellite is a musical masterpiece. But unfortunatly, the new release of POD's self titled ablum left them in the dumps."
2,"Great Scientist, Lousy Book",For a book that costs as much as $100 it feels more elementry school level than the college text book I expected. On top of that a bit more dated than I expected (Pluto is still called a planet).
4,Furtwangler's very last Beethoven's 7 & 8 symphonies,"These live recordings with Wiener Philharmoniker are very last conducted by Wilhelm Furtwangler in Salzburg Festival(30 August, 1954). In last period(since summer of 1952), Furtwangler's music making was very weak because failing health. So, these performances are not excellent rate. But I think its a very important Beethoven recordings conducted by Furtwangler. Its recording(made by Rot-Weiss-Rot) condition is very superior. I was very surprised after listening. Some people are misunderstand 'stereo recording' because its recording quality. I think these recordings are deliver purely 'Furtwangler's sound'. Orfeo's restoration technique is definitely superior than other CDs."
4,Classic bossa-era Brazilian vocals,"This CD combines two albums by Brazilian samba-bossa singer Elizeth Cardoso, ""Noturno"" from 1957, and ""Grandes Momentos Com Elizeth Cardoso,"" from 1963. These albums orignally came out on the Copacabana label, and show how her career spanned either side of the pre- and post-bossa nova eras. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
1,This is NOT the Russian group Tatu!,"Just to make one thing absolutely clear: ""Imperfect Girl"" is NOT an English-language single by the Russian pop duo Tatu!This single is a standard MOR pop single by some American group with the same name. The voices and the musical style are completely different from the Russian group Tatu (also spelled ""Taty"" in cyrillic and ""Tattoo"" in some reviews)."
2,Not a TATU single!,"This is not a single by the Russian duo Tatu/Tattoo/T.A.T.U./t.A.T.u! This is by Australian group Tatu. There three girls in this group, they are not claiming to be gay. I have listened to this single it is not my kind of music. If you want Tatu (correct Russian name Taty) look for there album 'Dvesti Po Vstrechnoi' which I think translates 'two hundred kimetres high in the wrong road'.I am apoligising if my English is not good."
5,"Taty (tatu) is a group, or 'pair' to be correct","Taty (pronounced Taaa tu')) is a russian pop group made up of two girls, ages 17 and 18. Their haunting melodies are all the more so to those of us who don't speake russian.The major selling point of their popularity, besides beautiful voices, has been the flaunted fact(by their manager and crews) that the two young woman are lovers.A few of their songs have been translated and re recorded 'All the things she said' being a version of 'Ya soshla s ma'.Perhaps it's the cultural differences, however the distinct combinations of their voices, band and synthisizers is used perfectly, creating a gorgious music that we don't find often enough here in the U.S.."
1,had to return this book,be careful ordering! the description sounds generic enough...but i got the florida state certification edition...i don't live in florida! i also got stuck with the return postage.
1,I can't imagine how other people found this tea drinkable,"It's really easy to spot good tea: it isn't pulverized into tiny particles.These teas have absolutely no flavor. If you are looking for water with anti-oxidants then this is for you; otherwise, I'd try a better brand, like Yogi Tea or Numi. You won't believe the difference.The green tea I sometimes buy from Aldi for a little over a dollar a box is far superior to this."
1,The photo does not match the description,"The photo shows 3 gears, but the description only mentions one gear,and that doesn't seem to match any of those in the picture.How can I buy it if I don't know whether I would get what's describedor what's pictured?"
3,Three WWII Movies,"These movies were enjoyable, though being made during WWII, they were showing their age, even with the help given to them when converted to DVD. For someone who enjoys war movies, this set is worth the price."
1,it was more of a story not really teach you how to train your dog,"it was ok for a story kinda book but for learning not so ok . didnt really like this book maybe others will , just being honest"
5,love it,I love this book. I was using it to help me teach my lab pup in search and rescue. Now she is gone and I have loaned this book out to a fellow SAR member who is getting a dog to work SAR ops.
2,search and rescue dogs,"the book was only about air scenting search dogs and discredited ( falsely ) trailing dogs which are very much a major part of search and rescue. Many times depending on conditions, they are the only choice yet little if any of the book was dedicated to them. The rest of the book was pretty good and useful."
5,Awesome!,"This book is awesome! I have the first edition,and this one is even better. The chapter on Disaster Missions is both interesting and informative. The steps for training to meet the FEMA standards is something I've been looking for, as well as the training for cadaver work. I can't recommend this book highly enough, both for new and experienced handlers."
3,Skip this one if your interest is not in land search,"Despite the cover depicting attention to the disaster search dog, this book primarily addresses dogs focused on land search. Much of the treatment given to DSDs is in telling the story of 9/11 canines and their handlers. The text provides very high-level overviews of the work done in training search and rescue dogs in what it calls cadaver, avalanche, and disaster search but offers little in the way of detail, focus, or direction for those for whom these areas are the primary interest(s). I did appreciate the illustrations provided for some of the scent exercises and recognize that the more detailed sections focused on land search have some value in these other applications as well."
3,Season 5 somewhat of a disappointment,"We have watched this series via Amazon instant video all the way from Season 1 through the season 5 season. We're certainly enjoyed the series....but this final year (season 5) was somewhat of a disappointment. It was very ""dark"" and while I'm glad we watched it to see how things end....it's not a very satisfying ending season. It's not that I think every TV show needs a happy ending...but there are so many ways the writers could have gone which in my opinion would have been more satisfying and less ""dark"". While watching season 5 it was like you were forced to carry around a 50 pound cement block while watching....it was heavy, dark and ended up with far to many loose ends for our tastes."
1,"FANTASTIC SERIES, HORRIFYING ENDING, BOO","The show was amazing, Bill Paxton beyound fantastic, the way he was protrayed as a loving husband, father, his religion, the major part I disagreed with was the poligamy thing, but the last episode destroyed the series for me, when are these people going to get it, we dont want the main charachter - heros killed, we want our happy every after, then before Bill was killed he's being draged to court, his business destroyed, then the show destroys the main actor, what is this, I cryed and felt so angry, kind of almost felt I waisted my time, thats how upset I was, STOP KILLING OFF THE MAIN PEOPLE, PEOPLE, just like the ending of Desperate Housewives, killing off Mrs Mcolsky, then they killed Mike, now they kill Bill on this show, I mean it, WTF"
4,held my interest,Was not expecting the end but enjoyed the series. My husband even watched with me. Seemed to have something for everyone.
5,Had to have it,"Can't have the rest of the series without the final season, right? Love the show, sad when it ended but it obviously couldn't go on forever. Not their best season, but did touch on some good issues - including how polygamy may not be the best lifestyle and the role of women in Mormonism (whatever form of Mormonism you choose to adhere to). The final episode was well done and was, in my opinion, a fitting ending to the series. Miss the Henricksons, but now I have them forever on DVD."
4,Sad to See You Go,"It's impossible to keep any series completely fresh in its fifth season, but this swan song still was compelling--especially the final scene between Bill Paxton and Jeanne Tripplehorn, a fitting end to everything the show was about."
2,Terrible final season,"After being riveted through the first four seasons, I was bored and disappointed by the entire 5th season. And the ending was completely contrived an felt rushed."
5,"Big Love, all seasons","We found this show to hit the nail right on the head! We are from AZ and grew up with the Morman influence and know of poly families! We found this so inline with real life! We always said if Tom Hanks was involved it would be good. This is one of the best Drama shows on today, or was. The way they ended the show was a surprise for both of us! We knew that Bill was going to get killed, we just did not figure it would be the neighbor across the street. 4 thumbs up."
5,Had to have this book,"I checked out this book from the library as a young child because I love origami and puppets. Now this book is out of print but I wanted to have it to share with my grandkids. It's wonderful. RIP, Shari."
2,Small,"I didn't see anything on this description that mentioned the length of the rod. It is only 16""-26"" so it was much smaller than I had expected."
4,Great When Used Correctly,"I got these to hold the curtains on the French doors. There is only a tiny lip for these to brace on, but if they are adjusted correctly they stick like glue. I suspect other users may not be adjusting them to customize the fit if they are falling out."
3,Cheap and flimsy,No matter how secure you think the rod is the easiest touch will have them on the floor. Not great unless they are in an empty room.
3,canon nb-1l,This product claims to work with the canon NB-1L battery but it only fits the canon NB-2L battery. Otherwise a good product and value if it fits your type of battery. Not mine.
1,damaged,"Can't review it, because I can't watch it. Though ordered as brand new, it is scratched. How do I return it?? Please advise"
4,A rape victim's story,"Do not expect shocking revelations and uncovered conspiracies. This is a documentary about a woman who was raped at 17 while working as a dancer at the MGM Sales Convention. It didn't take much to cover up this scandal 65 years ago. One bribed witness who magically couldn't identify the rapist, one unscrupulous doctor who proclaimed the innocent victim a tramp, one unhelpful mother who didn't want to stand up for her daughter. And as a result - one woman's life is ruined forever... Very sad."
3,"Tragic, not sensational","Patricia Douglas was one feisty gal and you have to hand it to her for ultimately telling her story 60 years later. But the idea that in the 1930s, a young girl was raped at a movie studio party and the whole thing was covered up...is this supposed to be a revelation? In the film, various legal experts weigh in and their incredulity that this happened is more shocking than the event itself.I know Patricia Douglas wanted her story told, but I came away thinking it was a disservice to her to make this tragic event and what little happened afterward into a full length movie, since there just isn't that much to say. This isn't a trivial story but padding it doesn't help."
1,Not even worth a cent,You will regret if you going to buy this. Basicaly its not a show if you expect it to be one.
3,If the director had just stayed on his own side of the camera.....,"This is a compelling story of how a 1930's teenage dancer, Patricia Douglas, was twice violated - once by a drunken MGM salesman from Chicago and once by MGM itself who paid off everyone connected with the case including Patricia's attorney and her own mother. Director David Stenn manages to find the elderly Patricia living in an apartment in Las Vegas and the two form a ""friendship"" though at times Stenn seems to be simply exploiting the woman for her memories to include in his documentary. Still articulate and insightful Patricia tells her story well and it is tragic to see how the incident she was brave enough to report adversely effected her relationships throughout her life. Stenn does a decent job of including film clips and newspaper headlines from the 1930's to set the story in its historical context. However he makes a big mistake in giving himself so much screen time as he comes across as annoying and a bit smug."
5,tools,"This bag is a perfect size to carry a small tool kit.It is completely out of the way,an is easy to strap on.This bag is also cheap on the wallet,i have 3 of them."
5,Catchy Tunes and Fun Lyrics...,"Fun, rock'in tunes with some lyrics that make you want to go jump on your V-Twin motorcycle and hit the road! Especially with songs like ""Drinking Around The World"" and ""Low Rider Girl"", you will definitely have your toe tap'in."
3,Haunted Ohio,"Beginning was excellent, but it slowed past the half way point.Can't wait to read rest of the series of books"
3,Haunted,This was one of our Christmas gifts for a son-in-law who was born in Ohio. I doubt he's even had a chance to read it yet.
1,Score: (D-),"This is really bad! My Wife and I have lived on, or vacationed on, all of the main Hawaii islands, and we could not believe this had been filmed here.1. Most of the scenes are of sand and waves that could have been shot anywhere, Santa Monica, Long Beach, South Padre Island, anywhere but Hawaii.2. The colors are washed out, giving the film a dull and drab appearance!3. Most of the scenes are overcast, misty, or foggy! No bright brilliant blue sky here.4. At the start and end of each segment you get these really annoying graphics and adds for their web sight.Get ""Bay Watch- Hawaiian Weddings"" and you'll get more of a Hawaii experience!!!"
5,Her story teaches us that spiritual awareness is a choice.,"Gale Warner's story is positive proof that each of us, if we make a conscious choice, can see and feel the Spirit of God in everything and everyone, in spite of, and especially during, adversity and pain. It is the little moments, Gale's descriptions of that divine CONNECTEDNESS, consistent and enduring, that touches me the most. Her tender, poetic prose allows us to glimpse the radiant, spiritual essence that is the birthright we all share. During these troubled times, the world finds itself somewhat short of role models, but with the loving gift of ""Dancing at the Edge of Life,"" Gale remains a lasting example. In her own words, she was and is ""a daughter of the four winds, a child of the moon and rain and sun ... sister of the whale, and the juniper."" I suspect that she now shines brightly in the heavens; each person who reads this book will feel the warmth of her glow, and best of all, will want to share it with others."
5,Love it!,"Bought this for my 1year old boy. The bear is the perfect size for his little hands, he loves to chew on the flagpole, and the little cart he loves to take apart(the wheels and axle are attached so the front axle is velcroed on as is the back)No choking hazard! So for the actual intended use of pulling it around we haven't seen that happen, but it does entertain in several other ways. Plus it is super cute and of very high quality. I Love Haba toys for that reason. Plus, there are NO batteries and annoying sounds."
2,If U spell FAT PHAT go for it - otherwise its just standard stuff,"Strictly for people who think dope means good, electronic is good, and you are hip if you use the lingo.Pretty standard drum machine, samples, and keyboards. Personally I find loops that extend through an entire track a colossal bore and I think most people would. I would describe it as standardized. BORING."
4,?,"Yo, Special Ed was my man because I liked the way that he used to flow on some of his songs, and everybody around my way says that he is my identical twin. Yo, where you at E. Archer?"
3,Playful Bellydance,"Anja makes bellydance especially playful and enjoyable to learn and she will teach you hip isolations, shimmies, the ""camel,"" tummy rolls, floating dance steps, fast and slow bellydance dance sequences. The Egyptian traveling steps are fun and the dancing progresses from slow to fast with lots of instruction and excellent cueing.The lighting, black sheet in front of the dancers, shadowy set (lighting seems strange) and the mesh thing Anja is wearing while dancing present a little distraction from the beauty of sensual bellydance, but this is still fun if you can overlook a few items that seem to be oversights during the production.~The Rebecca Review"
4,Informative and enlightening,"Dr. Maisel writes with simplicity about how a creative person (writer, artist, etc) may develop depression during the course of his or her lifetime and how to cope with it. I have a fairly healthy skepticism of books by psychologists, since one theory of how the human mind works is generally discarded after a year or two of research. However, I found myself underlining passages in this book that I felt applied to me (I write for my company's newsletter) and I related to many of the case histories Dr. Maisel provides that correlate with his theory. His four-step plan is well worth investigating."
4,Overall a great support bra with a feminine flair!,"This bra has exceptional fit and lift. I love the flesh tone, lace and support it gives me but think I may need a bit smaller size. The wires are unusually firm and cups may be too large but it does sit very flat in the area between my breasts so I am happy the wires don't try to stick out. The cups also seem a bit large and wide set but the fit is good around the back so I am unsure about the error in sizing? It is also a nice quality."
3,Watase-san can do better,"I have to say, Ceres is a serious let down. I mean, i have to adimit, the story is creative and very well told, it's just my problem is the characters. They are just plain unlovable. I think i only like 2 characters in the manga and that's Mrs>Q and Suzumi. They are pretty funny. But Aya, the main character is just annoying and just bugs me, Toya her boyfriend, is just unlovable(there's nothing to love since he shows no emotions), and that's just the begining. After a while,the manga gets a little....Mauture, which is a turn off for me. Basically, I think Watase-san did better with Imadoki and Alice 19th."
5,"Ceres: Celestial Legend, Vol. 1","This manga is very, very, very good! I was hooked after the first page. If you have read Yu Watase's Fushigi Yugi series (or, like me, am waiting for the tenth one to come out in the US, Grrrr!), then you'll love Ceres. It's about a teenage girl (FYI: guys, I'm not entirely sure that you'll want to read this, since it's sort of a chick book, despite a fair amount of violence and a disembodied hand)whose family is torn apart because her relatives want to destroy/use her for her power. Later on in the book, she learns she has this power because she is descended from a Celestial maiden. There is humor, fear, saddness, and hot guys in this series, so READ IT! You won't regret it."
5,Celestial coolness,"At the store looking at manga when Ceres: celestial legend jumps out at me. Took a look bought the book and was very impressed. Twins Aya and Aki go to a birthday party with the whole family for their sweet sixteenth birthday. What do they get? A very creepy mummified hand, that's what. (Wouldn't that be lovely?, I mean, you're finally old enough to get a learner's permit and your gift is a bizarre mummified hand.) Well the hand creates all sorts of problems. Aya finds out she's a heavenly maiden (a.k.a. she's on the run) and Aki gets locked in some room. Suzumi saves Aya with Yuhi's help. Also a guy named Toya from the mikage house (works there) seems to be protecting her... Well anyway, I never read Fushigi Yugi so I can't compare them, but this is a great series. GET IT!!! Hurry up and ship book 2!!!!!!"
5,i luv this book,"i luv this book so much and i tell everyone thats into manga just as much as i can about it...it is my favorite book out of every book i have ever read and ive read at least 30 different manga's by now...i really really suggest anyone in the world to buy this book...you won't regret it. i also have other series of this book, the other volumes i want them all....that is how much i luv it....................................thanx........luv, me"
1,Not Exciting,"This book was a let down. I felt gay vibes from it after halfway through the book. They story line was bogus. Maybe its just this kind of book, but I find it untrue because I like most Shojo, like Sailormoon and Alice the 19th. Art was mediocre. I guess thats what happens when you read BETTER manga."
4,phil is a musical genius,"all da klassiks r here: River Deep Mountain High, Be My Baby, Da Doo Run Run, Unchained Melody, You've Lost That Lovin Feeling. Also some cool obscurities like Puddin Tang, Zip A Dee Doo Dah, and Spector's own group recording with The Teddy Bears, an elegy to his father who committed suicide when he was a kid, To Know Him Is To Love Him. They ought to re release this and include some of his seventies productions such as Here It Comes (And Here I Go) by Jeri Bo Keno, a disco song Phil produced."
4,"Slow start, funny",This is from the director of Mother and the Host. Worth watching after watching everything else free on Prime Instant Video
2,A neat idea that falls short.,"Ordered this thinking it would help a bit but was slightly disappointed with the end results. Had a bit of a difficult time installing and ended up reusing the factory o'ring due to the inclosed paper gasket allowed the spacer to suck air and truck wouldn't run right. Looks neat and shiny but performance gains and at a absolute minimum, even when used with a cold air intake. Save your money and try something else."
1,displeased,the product fit OK but was missing two bolts. Once installed on my `03 S10 pickup it sat to tall and the hood would not close properly. When I tried to return it I was unable to get into the return portion of Amazon. Very displeased with AMAZON.
1,A Question of Civility,"If you're planning on eating this stuffed cabbage leaves, you had better, I mean: had better, be prepared for major, major gas emission bout! .... Be prepared, otherwise leave civilization for a while..... Believe me; civilization would not miss you until you have sufficiently recovered!"
5,My 3 year old loves this game!,"The reviews were mixed on this game, but my son loves Sccoby Doo and asked for it from Santa. It did take about 3-4 minutes to assemble/set up, but is well worth it. The game moves along quickly and is quite fun. I like that the game does not require batteries as well. The object of the game is to make it through the spooky mansion and reveal the villain dressed up as a ghost. Each time a player spins the spinner, the number of spaces is either on a tombstone or a ghost. If you get the ghost, you must press the ghost down at the top of the mansion. This action causes the staircase to shake, a trap to lift and fall, a moose head to knock you over and many more fun traps.The ages on the box say 5 and up, but as long as your child can count, and spin a spinner, they can basically play the game. They may require some adult assistance to know what spot on the game board to return to if they get thrown off of the board, aside from that, this is a great family game!"
3,Will probably break like both of ours did,"Yes, it's true: it's cheap and the first one we got broke in the exact fashion as another reviewer (ghost on top) and the second one broke after about a month of use BUT it comes with a TON of cool pieces and contraptions that *aren't* cardboard, is impressively elaborate and obviously well thought out (good design, poor quality). It does not require batteries and is fun and simple to play (for my 3 & 5 yr old). If it drives you nuts, the castle, pieces and ghost popping feature are probably still worth the $20 and return/replacement process. I say go for it but be prepared for it to break."
2,this game is a pain,"My daughter is 5 and loves games and Scooby Doo. She got this for Christmas, and even she does not enjoy it because it is so flimsy. Pieces fall off when you attempt to play. The premise is silly also. Well, I guess Scooby Doo in general is silly, but the game board fall apart at every turn and it is so frustrating to play."
3,Worth while,My son is a huge Scooby fan so he would love it no matter what. My only complaint is that the differences in the clues are kinda of subtle and easily confused. Still we have had a lot of fun with this game.
3,Fun for kids but parts disassemble too easily,"My 8 year old Scooby Fan loves this game but it annoys me and would annoy any other adult that trys to play but the flimsy way its put together makes it impossible to play normally. Each time you push the ghost down to set off the traps, the stairs fall down amongst other parts that do not stay in their designated spots. You constantly have to re-assemble the parts."
1,"Fun Fun Fun, but Breaks Easily","This game is a blast if it doesn't break. I played it with my 5 year old for about 30 minutes before it broke. We sent it back and Amazon got us another one very fast. Second toy hasn't broken yet. Basically you move your scooby character through the game and if the spinner lands on a ""ghost"", you press a spring loaded ghost on top of the game. The ghost turns some gears inside the game and randomly activates ""traps"" which can do various things to your character--very fun. The ghost on top is what broke so that it popped back up violently and would send your scooby flying across the room....still funny but not the way it's supposed to work. Furthermore, it broke with an adult operating the game. I can't imagine this will hold up with unsupervised kids playing it. Bottom line, it's super cheap chinese made garbage, but it's also really fun...worth the risk for $15-20."
1,It was great until ....,"... Until we tried to play it the second time. It's actually a fun game for kids (I'd say under 9 years old) but please read the other reviews. It's very poorly made. Ours lasted one round and then the spring mechanism failed. Took more time to set it up, read the directions and get ready than to play. It is not a better mousetrap."
1,"My seven year old daughter is crying ""This is the worst game ever!""","It doesn't stay together, the instructions are unclear and the spinner doesn't stay put. I'm not sure how I will even store this, but we haven't even gotten through one game yet. It makes kids cry."
1,Poorly Built / Designed,"Lasted for two games, during which I was the sole operator. My daughter was crushed when it stopped working the first night we put it together, and I have already contacted the game company directly to lodge a complaint.Update: After weeks of emails and phone messages left for Pressman games customer assistance, all with no reply, I have stopped trying to reach them and will instead simply not purchase ANY games made by them."
1,Falls Apart,"I gave this three stars for fun... but only one star overall - the only fun we had was laughing at how the whole thing falls apart and the spinner flies off then actually playing. It is a very cool looking game, but I can't believe how poorly it is constructed."
1,"do not buy this ""game""","This game absolutely sucks. Be forewarned. You WILL be disappointed. It is incredibly cheaply made, comes apart constantly during play and the game element really sucks too (it makes Uncle Wiggle seem like Axis and Allies)"
3,cute game for young scooby doo fan,"this game is cute for a child around 5-8 yrs old. made out of plastic and cardboard, fairy sturdy. spin the spinner to see if you will get trapped in a cage, or knocked off the staircase, or pushed by a suit of armor! the 1st player to climb to the top of the haunted house gets to uncover the villain and win! a scooby doo fan will enjoy this game."
1,very sorry but worst toy i ever bought,"this is way too hard to put together and shoddy once it is finally set up. very shakey when ""playing"". rules for being ""trapped"" are too hard. fun for kids to destroy & they like the characters, but so not worth it, really. sorry. I've never felt strongly enough about something to do a review until this mess."
2,Scooby what the hell?,I concur witht he silly-ness of the whole family trying and failing at putting it together and guessing how you should play. KEY***press slowly and listen for the CLICK! But if you don't hear it every time you'll be saying- Scooby Doo What the ...
2,"My child enjoys it, I do not","The instructions to put this thing together were a joke!!! I was squinting at the teeny pictures trying to figure out which piece matched which picture. I had to guess at most of it. Half the ""traps"" don't work. My son still enjoys it though. All I have to do is make sure he wins! And don't try to move this game. You just push it a teeny bit and the sides fall off, the stairs fall off, etc. Good luck!"
2,Scooby Haunted game,I am not impressed with this game for the money spent. Hard to put together takes up to much room to leave it up all the time. My daughter has played with it only a couple of times. Not the best!!!
1,Fed up with cheap toys!,"This toy looks really cool on the box. It would probably be fun to play if it would stay together, but that is just too much to hope for! My son is 6 and loves Scooby Doo. I put this game together and it would not hold up even for one time of play. Also, there is no way to store it because it doesn't fit back in the box after it is put together. If you had to take it down and put it back together more than once it would be a crumbled mess. Don't buy this toy!!"
2,Beware the Haunted Mansion,"The game is actually a pretty good concept and kind of fun. Plus, it has the bonus of going pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it is made so cheaply (overpriced!) that at times it is almost impossible to play. First off, the game board is small, so it is even hard for smaller hands to move the pieces on the back of the lower lever. Then the snakey stairs fall off continually. Plus, they are so shaky that the characters fall off almost every move which is a complete pain. Once you make it above the snakey stairs, the rest of the game is OK. Assembly is very easy. Our ghost didn't pop up properly at first, but now works fine. Beware - your kids will want to press down the ghost all the time. I don't see this game lasting long without breaking."
2,very disappointed,"My daughter wanted this game very badly for her birthday. I was hesitant after reading the reviews. Most talked about how difficult it was to put together. One review however said they had no problems and maybe there were improvements made. This toy is horrible!! It is difficult to put together and falls apart when you are trying to play the game, very frustrating. Big waste of $$."
4,Fun to play,"My son loves this game (he's 5 yrs old). The assembly directions were vague, at best, but by looking at the picture on the box i was able to put it together pretty easily. Once assembled, it was lots of fun to play."
2,"Played once, pieces lost, game shelved","My 7 year old really wanted this. She got it for Christmas, played it once and it went on the game shelf forever. Took longer to assemble than she spent actually playing it. Lesson learned."
2,It was ok while it lasted.,"We got this game for our six year old last Summer. The kids really liked playing it but every time you push down the ghost, playing pieces would fall off. Eventually, it got to be very annoying for us and the kids. The board is not sturdy at all and we never could get the stairs to stay on or the spider web and the moose head was a pain to put together. We just tossed it."
2,Not worth it!,"I hide this game because it can not be played with out a huge arguement. Set up is painful. Game pieces are flimsy cardboard. And yes, the house is supposed to shake...but just the act of pressing the button often knocks EVERYONE off the board. Then you have to decide ""what counts"" and what was an ""accident"". Miserable."
1,La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West (Volume 3),"Published by General Books, this is a travesty of a book. It is full of weird, inexplicable letters and symbols that make no sense whatsoever. It has paragraphs that end mid-sentence, never to resume. It has paragraphs that begin mid-sentence. It has sections that are reasonable but then they are interspersed by all this junk. I would never have bought this edition if I had had any idea what I was getting."
1,really????????,"cards were wrapped with SCOTCH TAPE when i got them!!! not sure how many of yall know this, BUT..................... scotch tape + cards + ME = PISSED!!!!!!!"
5,Great album!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this album. Here are the track listings:1. I Can't Get Next To You2. Are You Lonely For Me Baby3. God Is Standing By4. Tired Of Being Alone5. I'm A Ram6. Driving Wheel7. Light My Fire8. You Say it9. Right Now, Right Now10. All Because"
5,PLEASE CONTINUE,"Al Green's 3rd album. The one that gave us the joke 'I tried to call you, Honey, but I don't have your phone number.' You just got to hear it. Genius at its zenith. A must have."
5,All the strands of a career in one album,"This review has been written just as I finished ""Take me to the River"", Al Green's biography with Davin Seay ( available through Amazon books). It did what all good biographies of musicians should do - sent me back to the music, and this album in particular. This is a diverse album with the chart hit ""Tired of being alone"", the breakthrough that he had been looking for. There are hard blues ""Drivin' Wheel"" and ""I'm a ram"". Most of all, however,there are the pleading songs which he interpreted so well, ""Are you lonely for me baby"" and an astounding reinterpretation of ""Light My Fire"". The Hi house band is never less than sympathetic and at times astounding, with all the Willie Mitchell arrangements perfectly showcasing ""the voice"". If you've got the greatest hits album and you're looking for an Al Green album to explore further, this is it!"
3,Psalty VHS,The VHS case broke the first time we tried to play it. We were able to repair it with a part from an old case.
1,Waste of money,"Don't buy this, it's a total waste of money.As previous reviewers have said, it's garbage and does not work.Batteries get hot but don't have any charge no matter what brand is used. You would get longer life out of regular batteries."
1,not happy with this one,"My other charger takes several hours to charge, which can often be a pain, so I decided to try this one. It's okay if you need a few batteries in an emergency. But if you need to take a few hours worth of pictures, you'd better be ready to keep loading the charger time and time again to recharge. I get about a half hour's worth of picture taking without using my flash.I'll stick with my other charger. Takes a whole lot longer, but at least the batteries last for quite some time. Not at all happy with this purchase."
2,Fast Charger but not Good,"I have had this charger for about 6 years.This is a fast charger. It has charged my batteries in 15-20 minutes. At least thats how long the charge would last until it said it was done.This is what this charger is intended to do, BUT...Charging batteries this fast is NOT good for the batteries.I was only getting about 7-10 photos with my camera before it was saying that the batteries were dead. I was blaming the camera for this, thinking there was a short or something.Turns out that it is NOT the camera but the charger. These batteries need longer charge times to cycle properly. They will eventually burn out the batteries.This charger is only good if you absolutly need somewhat charged batteries in a hurry.Otherwise get a longer charging system."
2,overheats batteries during charging-but charges FAST,"*This is a 1000ma charger, which will cook 2 or 4 batteries at a time. It simply chargers them too fast, with too high amperage, with too much heat generated.*If you only want a fast charge, it's fine. If you want long lasting batteries, try the MAHA 401. 201, or RipVan 4000N. I own all three, plus a Collett.*I use AAA and AA NiMH batteries in motorcycle communicators, MP3 players, digital camera, Garmin GPS. I got this Digital Concepts charger for Xmas. It is the worst of the four I own for prolonging battery life, but does charge fast for quick tops offs."
1,"Nice battery warmer, can't hack camera usage",For those cold days you can warm your batteries and insert them in the fingers of your gloves. Just don't expect them to have a charge that lasts longer than 3 minutes in your digital camera. I'm picking out something different.
1,Useless as a battery charger,"While the model I bought is similar to this one (CK1005) it is doing the same exact thing everyone else reports. I tried charging all my rechargable batteries a couple of times with this charger and NONE of them work in my digital camera! At first I thought it was my camera until I put two ordinary AA batteries in it and it worked fine! What a waste of money. I'm buying a better more reliable brand. Thanks everyone for your reviews, otherwise I wouldn't have known what was going on!"
2,Fast Charger.. But..,"This unit charges batteries very fast (Hence the name Rapid Charger), It does make the batteries very hot during charging, I believe that it might damage the batteries in the long run, But so far it seems to work correctly, The provided 4 batteries are only 2000mAh (*New Updated*) which are worthless, My 4 year old Creative 1800mAh Batteries are better even after all these years of use.(You get the point?) The A/C adapter is good for only 120V AC, wish it had dual A/C selection switch for use in other countries, Car Charger adapter is added bonus, But that is rarely used. There are better products out there, But for the Price I think it does it's job okay."
3,Helpful Advice,This book was helpful to me when I was gathering information about starting a Deaf Ministry at church.
4,Good Resource,"This is a must-have book for anyone interested in ministry with deaf people or signing/interpreting songs. Sign Language is beautiful, but it's deeper than what we hearies see; it must have heart to be effective."
4,Fine for me,"I've had one of these scorecards for about 2 years and I like it. I'm not a pro, just a for fun golfer. The only problem I have with it is you reallly need to press the buttons carefully. Sometimes it does not advance the score or hole if you press too gingerly!I'm in the market for a second one...one of my buttons has decided to remain pressed in."
5,New book and fast shipping,Brand new book and came very fast for before I had to leave for college. No markings as promised and new. It is very helpful to have a clean book to read from!
5,"great shirt, great service",needed this shirt overnight for a photo shoot and this company not only has great product but their customer service was fantastic. got the shirt as promised overnight.
1,Algeria Hotel,The author takes upon himself a thesis too difficult argue successfully. His conclusions are evident before his evidence is presented. I found the narrative clumsy and repetitive.
5,Excellent and accurate advice!,"This book covers all the most common problems related to procrastination and ""lack of force of will"" to do those things that we all want to accomplish but never have the time nor the energy to do so. It has a direct and clear approach to the ""Hyde"" effects, or, using other words, the hurdles that hinder the progress to reach our goals. It's specially important that you write down all the proposed exercises in order to achieve the full strenght of the book's advice. Don't let your old habits overtake you, this method works and can help you!"
1,Ineffective,I read the whole book. It didn't work for me at all. It didn't provide useful information for me to push myself.
2,some good concepts,I thought the book was a little silly. I got a few good concepts that were explained well that I can use with my trainees.
3,A good book and worthwhile for those who need help in developing their self-esteem and self-discipline.,"Self-Discipline in 10 Days: How to Go from Thinking to DoingReview by Richard L. Weaver II, PhD.Bryant's book, Self-Discipline in 10 Days: How to Go from Thinking to Doing is more like a short and concise (160-page) workbook that offers a system for achieving more self-discipline in both your work and personal life. His are simple techniques (e.g., positive self-talk and visualization) for overcoming psychological roadblocks, identifying and getting rid of sub-conscious beliefs, and using time management strategies to maximize self-discipline. Bryant's exercises are useful and interesting, and overall, readers are likely to find they serve more to increase their self-esteem, perhaps, than their self-discipline. It is a good book and worthwhile for those who need help in developing their self-esteem and self-discipline."
5,Unexpectedly changed my attitude,"This book helped me finally improve my self-discipline attitude. The next thing I knew, I found myself getting on the right track on defeating a nasty habit of mine. As one reviewer said, it's like having a psychologist right in front of you. You won't regret buying this book. It's worth the price."
5,Powerful Information,"After reading this book I felt empowered. It gives you the tools to overcome the mental roadblocks to self-discipline.While this book may seem dumbed-down and simplistic (and this may bother you if you take yourself too seriously) it was actually clear and pithy. Many of the books in this genre have too many words that dilute the meat of the teaching. Not this one. It is a lean and spare manual that you will devour quickly and go back to often.Dr. Bryant is right-on when he says that you don't ""have"" self-discipline, you ""use"" self-discipline. It is a learnable skill, and he is an effective teacher."
5,The best self-help book,"This book quite literally has changed my life, or should I say helped me make the changes needed to change my life. Its simplistic and humorous format make reading easy and enjoyable. The advice inside is spot on and much easier to absorb than other similiar types of books. No long journey's to the past, just simple understanding of the kind of person you are and what you can do to improve. I had so many light bulb moments reading this book that I could have lit up a whole city!Many thanks to the wonderful author."
5,Great Book!!!,"This is my first review, and the only reason I am writing it is because I feel this book deserves it. Like the reviews before me said this book has an incredible step by step guide, on how to get your life in motion. Also it tells you exactly what you need to hear to stay motivated and not to fall victim to your bad habits. I highly recommend it!!!"
4,A practical guide to understanding what self discipline actually means,"This book simplifies complex psychological battles that happen in our minds in a very lucid way. Coincidence or not, the fears and reasoning used by our 'naughty self' preventing us from doing what we want, are very similar to the explanations provided in the 'Procrastination: Why you do it and what to do about it"" book, backed by years of research. This book takes it one step further and gives a practical approach to solving this problem. You may not take 10 days to achieve a good level of self discipline - it probably depends on how strong your 'Hyde' is, but the guidelines here definitely work!"
3,A good read,"This book is useful to get you started although it has no fool proof ""system"" to get things done. The two most useful parts for me were:1. Expanding the limits for what to get done after having read David Allen's GTD.2. The exercises were all useful and interesting to me, although they were not all about self discipline per se.If you are into books such as David Allen's Getting Things Done, Neil Fiore's The Now Habit, Tim Ferriss' The 4-hour workweek you will find useful stuff in here."
4,Pretty good overall,"If you actually do the stuff in the book you see results. The more you do, the better the result."
5,our best so far!,"This is the ""coming of age"" CD from us -- also our 10th year together -- and I think it presages new and unexpected things to come. It's a wonderful bunch of people with extraordinary gifts and good will. Truly a labor of love. bb"
3,Stupid movie,"I bought the movie because I am fan of Rupert Grint. Who I must say played his character well. The Story was awful. I would say that if you want to encourage your child to pass gas loudly this is the movie for you.I beleive that young children will think this is a funny movie. The parents of the child in the movie are funny (slightly)with how they deal with his problem. but, other then that ZZZZZ."
1,Abyssmal,"Rupert Grint apparently did a good job delivering what the the film's director and producers wanted. Unfortunately, what they wanted makes any Three Stooges movie look like an Academy Award winning documentary.The directing, special effects, cinemtography, and writing combine to make a move I'd have walked out on as an eight year old. The only redeeming features I can find in this film is that it gave Rupert Grint a vehicle to work on learning his craft and it gave him a paycheck. This has none of the excellence found in Wild Target or Driving Lessons."
4,Another way to do Spam,"When I was a kid (and more than a few times as an adult) we would take a regular can of Spam, mash it with a fork, add some Miracle Whip and sweet relish. Similar to this, but even tastier! Both this and regular Spam are in the Prep Room."
1,Strange taste and texture,"I purchased a can that the store before I bought a pack at Amazon to try it and GROSS! I love Spam, all the flavors of Spam but this was so grainy and salty I got queasy! Disgusting but my dog loved it! Well at least someone did. If texture is important to you this grainy item will put you off also. I love you Spam but this is a miss for me."
1,can't seem to make it work,I have tried to show this video for client's who are in treatment but it doesn't play on our DVD players. The DVD players work fine at showing other videos but this particular one doesn't play. So as far as the video about depression goes i havn't seen it to know whether or not it is any good.
1,Some people either learn like computers,"where you input:information (vocab list)program a set of rules (grammar)and finally spit out results (fluency?)or they are kidding themselvesthere are 24 cds, i skipped arounds and ALL THE TRACKS are simply a vocab list. I admit that they had some soothing music in the background, but does memorizing words really help you?Who the hell can memorize about 21 cds worth of vocab?The last 3 CDs are conversations, but apperantly, you are not only expected to know all this, but become fluent in the language and spit out conversations on your own!I hate to say it, but this is worse than rosetta stone. At it RS progresses from words to phrases, this here is just a vocab list."
1,Horrible brand,Ordered 2 Philip Persio watches. The first broke within a week (the analog part of the watch would randomly stop and go). The second watch (the one described above) broke within 2 days-the second hand fell off inside the watch and jammed up the other hands.I would recommend against this watch and this brand. This is funny enough to be featured on a sitcom about broken watches.
4,"Good, positive moral lessons and values","The second book in the Earl the Emu series, ""God Loves Me Just the Way I Am"" is a children's story about everyone being different but still being just the way God made them. Earl the Emu is feeling bad because he is so different from the other farm animals, but Jason soon shows him how God made him the way he is and he is ""as special as he can be"". A good children's book with a positive theme, ""Earl the Emu: God Loves Me Just the Way I Am"" is a recommended story for young children from three to eight years old."
2,Not for me,I bought this for college. Boring as hell. This book is for history majors. I didnt like it. No good
5,Great Program,I was speaking Indonesian in my car within two weeks. This is a very good program to learn conversational Indonesian in a short time.
5,Great way to learn a language,I've used the Pimsleur method in the past for learning basic German. They use a good pace for learning pronunciation and rythem of a language. You're not going to get any grammar lessons but it's a great start to get the gist of the language.
3,"Great method, but too short","Pimsleur is the fastest way I've found to learn to speak a language. Their method gives you the ability to make a sentence in a very short time, whereas every other course I've found simply has you memorizing words (eg, Rosetta Stone), without every knowing how to use them in conversation. Unfortunately, this course is just a teaser. Apparently, Simon and Schuster doesn't believe that anyone wants to continue learning this language, because they only put 10 lessons in this course, and they don't have any more courses in this language! That is very disappointing, because now I must find another way to build my vocabulary. S&S - get off your butts and finish the job!!!!!"
3,Indonesian CDs,I am learning from the CDs during my commute.1) The second CD skips during one of the basic lessons so while the later lessons review the earlier content it still makes it more difficult and really...CDs are old tech so why would there be quality issues.2) I don't understand the repeating the syllables in reverse order. It seems more confusing than beneficial.3) The order of things could be better too. It teaches you how to greet someone but I haven't gotten to the good bye phrase yet.4) For me personally it would be more beneficial to go through a bunch of phrases useful on a trip at the same pace as the first lesson. The pace and complexity of the lessons picked up faster than I would likeAt least I can listen in the car on my commute so it's non-intrusive to my free time and they are not pushing you into some online subscription.
1,How to Master 3 easy phrases in four weeks,This was a huge disappointment. I had just been studying Italian and listened to the 3 cds (Italian for Dummies)that had a huge range of topics and large vocabulary. The 5 cds of the Pimsleur had very little vocabulary and wasted a lot of time on repetition of very basic phrases that rarely varied. The reading booklet that came with the set was a joke. It did not include the conversations on the cds and it did not give the definitions or pronunciations of the few Indonesian words it included.Very disappointed
4,Wide-ranging with deep detail,"As the name says, this journal publishes 'survey' articles. Each one is a whirlwind tour of some subspecialty, written by an expert in the field. Since they are surveys, they offer a lot more breadth than depth, pointing out the many directions in which some topic has grown. And, always, there's a strong bibliography at the end. Often, that's the most helpful part of the article - the text tells me why I should care about the other references, and the bibliography tells me where to find them.The topics cover the whole range of computing, and there are usually just three to five articles a month. That means that many issues will miss the interests of any one reader. When an article does touch on an area that matters to me, though, it's very helpful. I find it worth the wait.//wiredweird(PS: ACM member prices for Computing Surveys are lots less than the Amazon price, even it you add in the price of membership. You are a member, aren't you?)"
4,good,The only reason i would give 4 star is that it sometimes get little bit lose and lose the balance.
3,not for lefty,"i like this product a lot and I use it a lot too for my camera and video camera, to get the flash or light higher, but im a left hander, and the grooves on the handle is only made for right handers and the rubber could be a lot thicker and softer so hands wont sweat. maybe a soft rubber foam would work with it."
4,Quality Hip Hop,"as only you would expect from some masters of the game that are true pioneers. So many jewels dropped for the younger generation as well as a sweet ode to all the mothers of the world doing their job on the trak Mama. Much love to the god body mcs, recommended for the hip hop purists who love that music that touches your soul and feeds your head, aint that what music's supposed to do?"
1,Corrosion Hell!!,"We've had these since 09/08 These worked GREAT for a while, but we noticed that with certain spices the covers came off hard. We just assumed the micro shape of certain spices causes the binding. Yesterday, we could've refill the one with Kosher Salt. After fighting we final got the cover off just and looked under the lid, and it looked like Rust... Then I look them up online and discovered these are Aluminum NOT Stainless so we were getting corrosion. MY mistake on that, but buyer beware!!! Tumeric, Salt, Adobo are just a few of spices that cannot go in these cannisters. Leafy herbs are OK. EVEN the placement strips are corroding."
2,"Good idea, flawed execution","I bought five sets, and mounted them inside a cabinet with the self adhesive strips provided. The tops don't fit snugly, so when the canisters fell off and spilled their contents, it made a huge mess. I then stuck them to the side of the refrigerator. The magnet on the back of one strip came off, and the stainless face plate (and all of the spices on that plate) fell on the counter, making another huge mess. Now the magnet has come off of the back of one canister; surely more will follow. One last thing: I would have prefered to have a set of spice labels rather than the bags of free spices (of uncertain origin) that came with the jars."
5,A MUST Have!!,"I would recommend this product to everyone. It is super easy to hang up (I screwed it to the wall, two screws one in each predrilled hole). It looks amazing and seems very sturdy. If you are debating to buy one or a few (I bought three...lol)I say DO it."
1,It Sounded Good On Paper...,"I'd been looking for a creative storage solution for spices and this seemed like a great fit - so much so that I bought two of them. They worked well for a few months, and in no particular order, the following occurred:1. The tins themselves corroded and became difficult to turn and open (for pouring).2. The magnet on the bottom of over half the tins came loose.3. Most of the spices became clumped up due to moisture even though the tins were sealed.Mine were not installed near the oven, as other reviewers had commented. All in all, an epic fail. One of the only items from Amazon that I've been completely disappointed with. I'm glad others seem to have had good experiences with this product, but that sadly was not my situation."
5,Magnetic Spice Tins are fantastic for organizing crafts/beads,Really attractive and modern Magnetic Spice Tins make fabulous storage for organizing your beads/crafts. It actually looks like upscale modern decor while being functional.
2,Two stars for good songs... no more so you buy their albums,"There's really no reason to buy this album... it's obviously an attempt on BMG's (not TMBG's) part to capitalize on the Giants' post Flood/Tiny Toons resurgence. (TMBG left BMG for Elektra after 1989's Lincoln and promptly had their first ""hit"" album, Flood, [""It's a brand new record|For 1990|They Might Be Giants| Brand new album, Floooooood""] which was recently certified platinum.) If you've seen the Tiny Toons episode (Buster Bunny:""Who ARE these guys?!"") or heard ""Boss of Me"" on Malcolm in the Middle or on MuchMusic, ignore this album and buy the original albums (They Might Be Giants and Lincoln). You'll get all of these songs plus many more of equal and some of greater wonderment. Because if you buy this album and like it and then buy the other two, you'll feel mighty stupid, won't you? Maybe if people buy the original TMBG albums from BMG, they'll take this opportunistc piece of plastic off of the market."
4,great,"I love this cd. Its really bizzare pop music and saves you them money of buying the first 2 albums. ""dont lets start"" is a classic and ""ana ng"" & ""puppethead"" & ""Everything right"" are true pop gems."
4,Another notch in the belt for urban fantasy,"This book has both humor and adventure. The mythological twist on the characters was interesting! In a way it mirrors shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel in that it lends belief to another side of life, a shadow world where monsters and mythologcial craetures are real. It's a fun read, pure escapism from the mudane everyday life!"
1,Ridiculous,"This book stunk! I took it back and asked for my money back! I don't think anyone proof-read the book. Every page has mistakes with spelling or grammar. The story is stupid. The characters are aimless. I think this is one of those ""do it yourself and pay us to print one copy at a time"" jobs. Ick. Ick. Ick."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"Too long, too repetitive, and too little plot wrap-up. You'd think with a book of this length there would be more of a finality to the end.In good conscience, I could not reccomend buying this book."
2,Just plain dull...,"Dull characterizations, relentlessly boring plot, heavy-handed moralizing. Useful perhaps as a tool for high-school history teachers, looking to engage average (but certainly not advanced) students in a discussion of life in a totalitarian state. As entertainment, it fails. If you want to know what life in Nazi Germany was like, read history. If you want ""escape from the Nazi baddies"" adventure, read Jack Higgins."
2,Grim Picture,"I enjoy a good alternate history, this one is very well constructed and well researched. However, I found it very depressing. I don't think even Nazis could live in the world portrayed in this work. Its a good read but be prepared for a long ride on the dark side of mans potential."
2,Unanswered questions,"Why did Germany not invade Russia? Why is New York a ""free city (huh?)"" and not part of the United States? Why is the swastika banned in the U.S.? We never banned the hammer & sickle during the cold war. What happened to Japan??? The author never answers these questions.Check this book out from the library before purchasing it. Or, better yet, read ""Fatherland"" by Robert Harris, ""The Man in the High Castle"" by Philip K. Dick, or anything by Harry Turtledove."
4,Tough to Put Down,"It's a very compelling read with a fascinating premise and strongly drawn characters.My only quibble (which is why I am giving it four instead of five stars) is that the way the characters' paths continually cross and recross strains credibility. Europe is a big place - even assuming that the war and its aftermath took a devastating toll on the populace - and yet the same people end up stumbling over one another again and again! A couple of similarly ""fortuitous"" occurrences (which I will not detail here in fear of spoiling the plot) also detract from the overall power and believability of this novel.Nevertheless, it was engrossing enough to turn me into an antisocial outcast during my Fourth of July holiday, and there aren't too many books that could have done that."
1,Bludgeoned to death by meaningless brutality and detail,"I was initially intrigued by the alternative world view of this novel, and was undaunted by the 1200 page length. HOWEVER, after page upon redundant page of ""insight"" into the brutal nature of the Nazis, I quickly became numbed to it. The character developement is meandering at best, and in light of the length of the novel, unrealized and inconclusive. I forced myself to resist the urge to skim through the repetition and reiterations in hope of seeing the plot develope. The plot and the characters could have been developed in 1/3 of the length of this novel, and would of been less of a chore to read. Despite the cited research and effort, and altogether unsatisfying and tedious read!"
5,"Genius, Bravo, encore","The Childrens War was by far the best book I have ever read. At somewhere around 1150 pages the book may seem tedius, but once you start, you cant put it down. So much inner turmoil and thought is depicted its mind boggling, Stroyar obviously understands the twires of the human mind. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has the time to read it, This book is simply magnificant. I never praise literary works, infact I critisize them, but I cannot find anything I dislike in this book, violence was present but it never interfered with the plot, or character building. Every twist in the plot was believable but at the same time, not... If you have time on your hands and want to read a good book, put that book you were going to read aside, and pick up The Childrens War. (P.S. I apologize for any spelling and/or puncuation mistakes, this review was written on a plane)"
2,Cheap material,"I bought these and was disappointed. The wire is very thin and flexible. I would not hang any thing of value with these plate hangers. There is not a plastic buffer on the holder either, so you would have metal rubbing against china or ceramic which can cause cracking or chipping. Also, you are just purchasing the plate holder, not the special hook used to mount your plate. These are not worth the price they are listed for."
1,super small watch,When the watch arrived I thought I recieved the female version or something. The watch is super small. Between the size of a nickel and a quarter. It looked terrible for a man's watch. Think of your grandmaw's little watch you can barely see and that is the size of the watch. The watch itself if just a little bigger would have been great as it is a good looking watchg but I just couldnt get over the size of the watch.the delivery and arrival was perfect though. Although it has been exactly 1 month and I still haev not recieved my credit for the watch.
5,Great Product,Item met all expectations.Now enjoying the fragrance.Received the order well within the anticipated arrival date.Would recommend to others.
5,A fascinating book,"I found the book to be fascinating, even for a person without a background in the classics. I felt the translation was fine, overall a very smooth read. I would highly recomend it to anyone with an interest in Arthurian legends."
3,"Odd translation, but moving stories","This book was translated from the old French oddly, perhaps too literally, and the result is that sometimes the fact that it used to be in verse form gets in the way of the story. Most of the time, though, the stories are the fun and gripping legends Arthur-enthusiasts will love."
3,Free SF Reader,"There are several examples of the French chivalrous tradition here, and all that courtly love stuff. Or, how to wear shiny armor, look pretty, do what your religion tells you, be nice to ladies but don't knock them off their pedestals.Try to get really, really good at killing people and beating people up, too."
2,Read this and you'll appreciate Cervantes.,"An awful yawner. It shows all the reasons chivalry made for tiresome tales, and why the world needed Don Quixote so badly.The Chretien de Troyes version of Lancelot is repetitious, has many loose ends, and is full of plot holes. Lancelot jumps into a cart to shame himself in pursuit of Guenivere. Before Lancelot jumps into the cart, the narrator states that ""reason is the enemy of love."" In the scope of the book, and the code of chivalry, reason is the enemy of this genre.Take with Nyquil."
4,i love grinspoon,"This is the BEST song of Grinspoons so far (at least i think so) I can't wait to hear the whole album, EASY. Aussie talent is indisputable!"
4,Excellent movie - There is a surprising twist at the end.......,"I rented this movie from the local store and enjoyed it so much I had to purchase it as a part of our 'arsenal' at school. As a foreign language teacher, we use foreign films to capture not only the language but cultures of other countries by showing films to our students. Sometimes we integrate them as a part of the curriculum, whilst other times we show them as an end of term treat. We find difficult to find Spanish-speaking films for those under the age of 15, but this was very good in capturing different Spanish-speaking dialects and aspects of pop culture.This film is amazing and will be loved by all; I showed it to my grades 7 - 9 classses and they loved it! I have them hooked on enjoying foreign films :)"
5,Very funny and Random!,"The first time I watched this movie was with a friend who thought I acted like one of the characters in the movie. I did not expect it to be so funny and still show how easily people do get fooled into things and are basically robbed. It's a good movie to watch with friends, at least we did at my home."
4,Entertaining and funny,"This is a cute film you would want to watch on your night off and laugh all the way. It is made with actors unknown to me, but with tremendous (comedic) talent. What I enjoyed about the film is that is it exploits the prejudices about (hispanic) immigrants in a way that is not insulting but funny. The other things about this movie is that is it another take on one thief scaming another thief theme. Do not expect is to be as sophisticated as ""Ocean's 11"", but I promise the film will make you laugh. My favorite actors are father/daughter duo. Those wo actors just steal away the whole movie. Enjoy!"
3,Ladron que roba a ladron,"Very funny, but can't show it to my Spanish II classes because of all the curse words used in the subtitles. Not all those foulest of words was actually said in the Spanish, so why would the translator want to put them into the English subtitles? I am so disappointed!!"
3,ocean's 11 as a latin soap opera,"I wasn't expecting an over-the-top melodramatic farce, but once I realized that's what this was, I got into it. Just let yourself enjoy it!"
5,Love,"excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic, easy to use. Love it"
3,OK movie till climax,"Another trying to be different movie from Anant, his past were good but this one below the expectation. The movie is about a Mumbai girl (Minisha Lamba) who marries to rich guy from Rajasthan, Vikram (Dino). Vikram a widower whose first wife disappears mysteriously, takes his newly wedded wife ti Gajner and from there her quest to know about Anamika (first wife of Vikram) starts and leads to a hopeless end. Movie gets some speed but the looks like director was confused about how to end the movie. Due to small character list, you will easily predict the killer among suspect. Strongest point of the movie is Rajasthan, else its below avg movie in most of the department, including music. Anu Malik should retire now. Watch it, if you want to spend some time with OK kind of movie. Though I am usually kind in rating but my 5* to this movie."
1,do not order this unless you need a size 5,"I cancled the order yet I have been billed by amazon. Be very careful they do not tell you its size or give you the option to choose size you hit the button and the order is complete without giving the size. Yet it tells you to order the next size up if you need a half size, very deceiving"
1,Beware,Amazon and Seller don't tell you they only come in one size... 5! Don't even think you can order another size.
4,A great book for starters in TCL,Welch's always writes in a very understanding manner. His other book on Practical Programming in TCl and TK is also very good.
3,There's always room for another tale of Russian Tsars,"The author once told me that in an e-mail, so I kind of feel badly making such notes on his work. I thought that the book was good. I do have to say however, that the Russian people that were created for the book are entirely ficticious. The Russians in the story were so civilized. Commonly, Russian folks are known for being slightly radical and having revolutions. The corruption and the violence seemed more realistic to me. Besides, they would never trust outsiders with finding and crowning their royalty. It was an exciting tale though."
4,Good pseudohistorical thriller,"""The Da Vinci Code"" made popular the pseudohistorical thriller genre. Steve Berry's ""The Romanov Prophecy"" is set in the near future in a Russia that has elected to bring back the tsar. It looks as if a distant relative to tsar Nicholas II is about to get elected when Miles Lord, an african american lawyer uncovers some papers, including a prophecy by Rasputin, and a letter from Lenin. Before long, Lord is hunted by russian hitmen and, with the help of a beautiful Russian acrobat, needs to find out why, and stop the conspiracy that is about to elect a tsar that will be a puppet for the mafia and international business interests.In reality, bringing back the tsar may not seem like a good idea, but the story is still interesting. The pace is quick most of the time and the book offers lots of interesting alternate history, albeit (like the Da Vinci Code) based on old ideas.This is the first book by Steve Berry that I've read and I will probably check out his other books."
3,A Disappointment,"I had high hopes for The Romanov Propecy, based on the online reviews and description. I have been a fan of Dan Brown's thrillers, and had long been fascinated by the Russian royal family and the lingering question of whether any members had survived the Revolution.But this fictional exploration disappointed me. The plot is simply not rich enough. You know very early on what the conspiracy is, have a pretty good idea who will come out on top, and can easily guess how it will all end.The writing fails to build suspense -- Berry is no Dan Brown -- and so the book, while painless, is far from memorable."
1,pure pablum pulp fiction,"this was one of the most horrible books i have ever read. considering how fascinating the subject matter is, it needed to be treated a little more seriously. this trite potboiler turns a thousand years of Russian history and events with world-shaking consequences into a bad soap opera with decoder ring marvel magic. the highlight of the whole book is when the black man has to face down an 800 pound gorilla named ""king arthur"" in order to save the beautiful white russian woman. she is a circus performer, and that is exactly what this author has done with the romanov legacy--turned it into a three-ring circus act. anything that has a black man facing off with a gorilla needs to be burned."
4,A great mix of historical fact & fanciful fiction!,"I'm usually leery of fiction that combines ""what if?"" questions about key moments in history with Ludlum-esque thriller motifs, but I'm happy to report that this time, it all comes together in a sitting-on-the-back-deck-taking-it-easy-with-a-400-page-I bought-it-at-the-airport-book kind of way.You might think that calling this ""airport fiction"" is damning with faint praise -- but hey, for $10.99, I try to manage my expectations!Where this book is particularly successful is in its integration of up-to-the-minute information about the fate of the Romanovs in 1918 and beyond. At the end of the book, the author provides a useful explanation of where history leaves off and his imagination takes over ... and as someone who owns about 1,000 books about European royalty, I am pleased to endorse this particular title!"
2,Must be his first,"For Steve Berry, the search is the thing. This could not be more true for the main characters are poorly developed. The hero Miles Lord is black because he has to be (read the book) and he is totally unbelievable as is his boss - and villain - Taylor Hayes. Lord is pursued by a trio of bad guys who makes the three stooges seem like Elliot Ness. If these guys had failed, most authors would have had their bosses kill them off after the first miss rather than transport them halfway around the world to fail for the umpteenth time. What should be dramatic becomes truly funny. The search for the Romanov's shows Berry's lack of skill at this point in is career."
2,"had potential, but not worth the read","I picked it up because I'm all for some historical fiction,sometimes it's the best kind, the kind that could almost be real. However, I must say I couldn't stand the way the author chose to write the book, in some weird second third person narrative mixture, at times I didn't know who 'he' or 'she' was referring too. So, bad grammar wise. For the story, it really wasn't nearly as interesting as I thought it would be, and many times it lacked the background/depth to make the story in any way real. Also, the book portrays Russia as a desolate country with tons of poor and mobsters everywhere. I don't know if that's true, but at least to me it didn't seem very accurate. And to top it off the main character wasn't even endearing, I didn't like him more than I liked anyone really....all in all, don't buy it"
3,Decent Historical Fiction,"To explain the rating: A 5 star to me is on the level of the great Classics (aka Classic-to-be), 4 Star are books on par with Harry Potter Series, 3 Stars A Good Read.That being said this is a good read for Historical Fiction. For those of you who want a ""real life"" believable story line - read a historical biography or non-fiction book. If you want a good evening read ""movie style"" book this is worth picking up."
3,Miles Lord.... Dumbie?,"I wanted to like this book, but Miles Lord, our hero, kept getting in the way. Was there ever a more naive, stupid person, than this guy? Someone is trying to kill Mr. Lord at every turn, but he can't imagine for the life of him, who it is. I just wanted to shout, ""It's your boss, Miles""!! Steve Berry had a great premise. When the Romanov bones were discovered, two bodies were missing. Did any family members survive being killed by the Bolsheviks? Berry just needed to tighten up the story line by presenting a less gullible Miles Lord."
4,fast paced thriller!,"ok, as of this morning i've now read all of steve berry's books, i've enjoyed them all! this one was really good, i liked the plot, the history, the action scenes, well, everything!highly recommemded!"
1,"the plot: power, control, greed, deception, ruthlessness","I think that my title says it all. If this what you find delight in, you will have a full plate. Not me. This book pummels the reader with the dark aspects of the human spirit, with everything that is dark, heavy, and tedious in the Russian soul, the only relief being when you put it down and do something else."
5,The new Tsar in town,I saw this book and the title is what attracted my attention. From the first chapter of this book to the very last chaper is action packed. I totally enjoyed this novel. Its a great read. I felt sorry for what happen to the lawyer and how he had to travel from Moscow to USA and everything that he had to endure.what a plot. finally finding the truth.very exciting.
2,Kind of interesting for history buffs,"I can see history buffs being interested in this book. There is a lot of action , but it gets old. The story becomes too predictable and the reader get discouraged due to the stupidity of the main character who is supposed to be a super intelligent lawyer. I rather read Salgari, better arguments. I did finished the book and saw it as enterntainment only, definetely not in the line of the Davinci Code."
1,Stuck on Duh?,"I got to page 120 when my ""b.s."" meter pegged out. Either all Russian mafia and police are incompetent buffoons ala Keystone Kops, or Johnnie Cochran got reincarnated with the powers of Superman. To believe a black research attorney working in Moscow could avoid five (count 'em FIVE) assassination attempts in two days goes beyond believability, Denzel or not. I wanted to enjoy this read but it wasn't to be found here."
5,This was very entertaining.....,I really enjoyed this book by Steve Berry. In fact I have read all 4 of his books and I must say they are very good. The Third Secret is my favotite of his. I doubt he has studied Dan Browns style as some may think. He takes a historical event and puts some twists and turns to it and comes up with great novels. Dan Brown has had ONE (maybe two). Keep an eye on Mr. Berry. He will come out on top in the long run. Read them all and enjoy.
2,Pass this one by,"I was so looking forward to reading the book because of the subject matter. Unfortunately, I found the characters shallow and in some cases down right simple-minded. The novel moved in a slow and predictable manner.As another reviewer noted, the use of Russian words and phases puzzled me at times. Especially the author's use of chornye. Growing up Orthodox and Ruthenian, the word meant black. I never heard the word used as the author states. As with the coon chase, you would think there was an attempt at atonement by the author.Last, you never kill the dog. Kill whole villages and cities, but never the dog."
2,Suspense?,"At one point in the book one of the characters asks why anyone would believe this crap?I was asking myself the same question, but the book plunged forward, skirting close to the edge of a cliff. The gist of the plot is that Russia decides it wants to bring back the Tsar. Why? We're never told, just that there is this commission that is going to pick a new Tsar in six days and the vote must be unaminous.Six days - right.Miles Lord, a dufus lawyer, who manages to piece the century old clues together that lead to the Romanov heir, but can't figure out that every time he calls his boss, people show up to kill him.Too bad they didn't succeed. Any character this dumb deserves a dirt nap.Thrillers are suppose to accelerate towards the end. This one s-l-o-w-s down.Save yourself the trouble, read something else."
4,mjm comment,"On a personal level, I have always been interested in Russian history, especially that which reflects their wars, as well as the Tsars and royalty. Based on the history it is sad what actually happened to the royal family. I felt that Berry's bookactually gave a good account of the actual events. I appreciate his telling in the appendage what was actually fiction on his part for the book. I love the action and mystery books."
5,The Romanov Prophecy,"I always enjoy reading books by Steve Barry. This one was particularly interesting because it is about Russia, that in itself is mysterious. We all know the history, but Barry brings it to life in a book that I found hard to put down."
3,Enjoyed the Story,I enjoyed this story. The reason I gave this three stars is that it is slow getting started. Warning this author bombards you with some historical fact and hypothesis of what happened in history because there is no clear record and then there are things that are pure fiction. The inclusion of this detail may annoy some readers and this at times bogs down the story. Once the author believes he has his back story set things start to pick up and it is an enjoyable read.
1,The Da Vinci code meets the Tax code,"This book was awful, predictable and just outright boring. Miles has more lives than a cat. Save you money and your time and pass on this one."
2,Benefit of the Doubt,"From time to time I comb the shelves of a bookstore in search for a new author. That's how I stumbled into Steve Berry. Reading the summaries of his books it's clear that he tries to emulate Dan Brown; Brown actually endorses ""The Romanov Prophecy"".Needless to say it doesn't compare. This book is confusing and slow. The plot is unbelievable and the bad guys are the most inept lot put together in the history of literature. I know this is fiction, but if you know a little about Russian culture you will keep raising your eyebrows, too many licenses and inaccuracies.This is Berry's first effort, only for that I will give him the benefit of the doubt and two stars and maybe pick one of his latest offerings like ""The Third Secret"" to see if there is improvement.As for you fellow reader I will recommend to skip this one."
3,Light summer read,"A typical light summer read in the ultralight thriller genre (think Dan Brown). I wouldn't describe it as a gripping page turner (I was able to put it down), but certainly it moved along and was a pleasant read. The main characters were well constructed (appropriate likable and distasteful), but some aspects of the story are telegraphed well in advance."
4,If you like Russian history......,"This book started out a bit slow...;but picked up speed as you read along; [second chapter-where the author tied things together]Then, the ""history pulled you in""; IF you like Russian History--esp. to do with the Romanovs. The author has done his homework as far as research of them. I wish his fictional account was really true!! It would be great if the close blood line of the Romanovs were saved.As I read on, I was still interested on how he [the author] was going to ""entertwine"" the history of Russia with the Romanov Family History..So sad the real History...A good thriller read!~!!!"
4,Enjoyable Novel with good suspense and action,"Spent a few days reading this book during the holidays. It was well paced, good action, good suspense and not too heavy on either melodramaticism or sappiness. I don't know enough about Russian history to answer some of the reviews but I will say that if you can just immerse yourself in the novel you will enjoy it. I didn't really see the 'keystone cop' stuff or the 'Super Johnny Cochran"" things as much as I saw a protagonist not unlike what you'd find in a good movie with equally effective villains in a big conspiracy. If you just read it for the joy and for the story you'll be a very happy camper."
4,Great Airport book,"It will never be a great work of art...but to fill in the long hours of travel this pulpy novel fits the bill. It has the MOST annoyingly stupid Lawyer as its hero, but go past this and you have an escapist fantasy. Sure it used real history and sometimes real speach from people who existed but unless you look on this a total fantasy you see too many faults. Think of this as a mindless TV show, sit back and just enjoy it for its ride. Great fun!"
4,Good book; A little far fetched,"I thought the book was great as far as incorporating historical data with fiction writing. It was a fun journey with twists and turns that at times made you wonder how they would escape. My problem lies in the main character who is trying to be passed off as a very intelligent lawyer who has absolutely no insticts and intuition. Overall though, this was what a book should be--fun to read."
2,"Not great, don't waste your time","I bought this book after reading The Third Secret, thinking I'd get another good read. I was so wrong. The Romanov Prophecy is predictable from page 1. About halfway through, it turns into one long chase scene. There are no plot twists or turns, you know exactly what's going to happen from the beginning. I started to quit about 2/3 of the way in, but felt I had too much time invested to just drop it. There are much better thrillers out there. Try The Historian. Fantastic book!"
2,Implausible plot line,"I read the whole book very quickly just to see how it would end. It was inventive to a degree, but just not at all realistic, even from a fantasy point of view. Also, I'd like the editors of the book to look up the meaning of the word ""courtesans"" - the word I believe they should have used was ""courtiers!"" I read the Amber Room, was disappointed, and thought I'd give Berry one more try - now I'm done."
3,difficult to find - get it while you can,"Difficult to find - I searched for 3 years to get a copy of this!The is Stan Getz after his exile to Sweden in the late fifties. If not for his Swedish wife whisking him off to avoid him getting busted for his bad habits, he might have ended up like Art Pepper.Well recorded.The backup band is competent but doesn't push him to excel. He stands out in some cuts, in others he plays his ""Brothers"" type harmonies with local sax players.balanced with ballads and swing tempo tunes, not much fast bebop. I like ""Topsy"". Uniformly pleasant and tuneful.3 to 3 1/2 stars = a tuneful record the quality of the majority of his output if not better."
3,"Pretty good reeds, many duds","Compared to normal Vandoren reeds, these are much better and less of them are duds. Unfortunately, though, about 3 out of every box don't work. These are supposedly tested by professionals, so I don't see how this could still happen! The company is very bad about dud reeds."
2,"Red Buffalo, Where's the chocolate-cherry?",Can't taste the flavors. The coffee is OK if you like black coffee. I wanted the distinct taste and aroma of chocolate and cherry. This coffee doesn't have it.
3,A Long and Threaded Tale,"The basic characteristic of this book, rather the one that I most associated with it, was LENGTH. The narration is a variable too, the author's language tends to change from a complete recitation of facts to the inner feelings of some of the characters. Another characteristic is that this book runs through at least three story threads as the author covers the stories linking Joe Hunt and his associates first to the murder of Ron Levine and later with the appearance of Reza Islaminia and the murder of his father, Hedayadd Islaminia. The BBC has its spectre of characters, and almost one by one, the author writes the account of their deeds, most of the time recitating the facts and never jumping to any conclusions. At times, it seems like an excerpt of judicial records."
2,Save it,Awful! Not worth the money. Poorly organized and no real organization to the sequence of exercises.
1,Kid Basic,"OK, I'm guilty. I judged a ""video"" by its cover. The name says it all--it is basic. All through the program, I kept thinking to myself: ""This would be great for my kid"" (who is 11 yrs old). In other words, this is kids stuff. Very easy to do and follow. The setting was NOT at all nice--It is a stage with a curtain backdrop. If you decide in the end to buy this, follow the instructor and the blonde with the long hair, as they are not ""awkward""."
1,No way!,"Wow, this is a horrible exercise video. I checked this out from the library and watched it once through (as I do all my videos) and was in total disbelief that someone would buy this. The exercises are way to basic and the instructor was a male version of Denise Austin but worse! I would not recommend this video to anyone and that says a lot from someone who likes lower intensity moves."
3,Great taste for too much $$$,Good product for a totally unjustifiable price. It is eggplants not caviar! There are other brands that are as good for less.
3,"Ok, but not worth the $80 when it shows $14.99 on the back cover",Can't believe the price for this little bitty book. The information wasn't that good! Guess I'll do more research next time before putting out that much money!
1,absolutley JUNK (waiting for refund),"very unhappy about this purchase. The part was damaged when I took it out of the package. Cracked by a mounting hole, & one of the electrical connectors was brown & rusty. Send product back waiting on refund. Funny the return address on the package was the same as where I had to send it back to. (The returns Center)."
3,looks different,"Good quality, but not what we thought it would look like. It is embroidered like we wanted, but not the design we wanted. It is kind of hard to tell the detail from the picture. A magnified look would have helped. It has a shimmery thread added in, so if that's what you want, go for it. Either way, I would have to say that the retailer was extremely helpful in returning the item. Great customer service!"
2,No USB cable,"The cradle works fine as a holding device and a power charger, providing you have the power charger cord that came with the camera. The cradle comes with an HDMI cable and a remote control. However, I was disappointed that it did not come with a USB cable or a power cable. The USB cable for this camera is proprietary, and I had misplaced mine. The main reason I bought the cradle was to get another USB cable, as I could not find one anywhere. I was surprised that there was no USB or power cable in the box-the instruction booklet says to hook the cradle to your computer with the cable that comes with the camera. Not too helpful. I solved the problem by buying a USB card reader for $19 at Best Buy and hooking it up to my Mac, then reading the camera card. Not as convenient, but it works."
1,CANNOT USE WITH XBOX 360,"Per the website of the manufacturer, you cannot use this product with XBOX 360. I had no idea, even with adapters you cannot use it with the 360. I bought the product and it said that it is pretty generic to work on any system. However, per the below snip-it from the manufacturers site, it is not compatible with live. I guess this can only be used for PC and PS3. They really need to make that clearer. I definitely felt ripped off. It says that it won't work with live but comes with a mic? Man what is the point? I would just use my stereo phones in that case. Waste of time and money.Per the manufcturers site:<strong>Computer Gaming Headphones NOT compatible with the Xbox:</strong>- EarForce X-51- EarForce X-52- EarForce HPA- EarForce HPA2- EarForce SPC <<------this one- ANR-10- ANR-20The above may be used with the Xbox for Stereo listening only (No Live).Also, although they would look quite funny, they may be used with the iPod,again for Stereo listening only."
3,Adequate. Nothing more; nothing less.,"The headphones work. Sound quality isn't stellar, but it isn't at all bad considering the price point. Perfectly fine gaming headphones -- unless you play WoW or EVE for the music.If you want better, you'll pay more. These will get the job done while you make that decision."
4,Good purchase for the price,"I purchased this headphone a couple of weeks back and am happy to say that i am satisfied with its performance. The only complaint i have is that the volume could have been better coz i think the max volume is slightly on the lower side (this can however be made good by using software audio amplifiers). Other than that, the sound quality and the mic are both good for the price. Overall, a good purchase."
5,Can't go wrong at this price.,"I bought these from Amazon and after two years of daily use, they're still going strong. They sound great, you won't mistake them for a pair of high dollar Sennheisers, but for gaming and listening to mp3's they do very well with no noticeable distortion. The mic works well too. I've used these for Centra and Adobe Com meetings and heard no complaints. At less than twenty bucks including shipping, they'll be no buyers remorse with these."
1,This is not a good book for beginners.,"This is the textbook required by my professor. When I read it, I just felt that the author wastes a lot of words on some very simple and straightforward points. But as to those very confusing concepts and complicated procedure about how the economy adjusts, he uses as few words as possible. For example, when talking about the adjustment of inflation expectation, the author doesn't explain why and how the new equilibrium point appears at point E2 in figure 8-2. And I think this is very important to understand the underlying theory. Also, there are many inconsistent points and some critical typos in this book."
3,review,"It is a great supplement book to intermediate macro. I found that reading this book after a class lecture helps best to understand the subject. the math described is a bit unclear. like I said lecture, then read"
4,Macroeconomics - timing is everything,"In selecting this course and seeing the 11th edition was being replaced with a 12th edition coming out in Mid-April, I thought it would be a good thing. To my surprise, I hope the 12th edition is better, I was wrong because the 11th edition is not structure to help students taking the course on-line or even in a classroom setting. The reading and examples on given equations are not clear for an average or above-average student.Another note - the cover was different from what it appears on the web - a plan yellow/green hardback book"
5,Great Purchase,"The book shipped extremely quickly, and it is in great condition. I would definitely recommend this seller and the product is exactly what I expected."
2,Did not work with HTC One S,"This did not work with my HTC One S. My phone allerted me about not receiving enough power, and that using this charger could result in damage. The seller accepted my return with no problems."
2,strings snapped when tightening then using a standard tuning for sitar. where can I get a new set?,sitar strings are hard to find so I may have to buy another set shortly. Most of strings worked OK. There's no guidance in stringing which is extremely complicated with the sympatic strings. No labeling for strings.
4,Interesantes ténicas de defensa,"Compre este video para regalarselo a mis primas quienes estan por entra a la universidad y en mi país no es precisamente un lugar para estar sin saber algo de defensa personal, especialmente las mujeres.Vi el video y me impresiono la sencillez de las técnicas utilizadas, de hecho he estado prácticandolas y mi familia entera se ha unido a esto, el hampa en mi país esta desatada y uno nunca sabe cuando va a necesitar defenderse.Es muy importante recordar la advertencia de la cinta, estas técnicas son potencialmente mortales y su uso como ejercicio debe ser supervisado por algún experto y se requiere de un buen estado físico.Estos movmientos son sencillos una vez que los empiezas a practicar parece que son de toda la vida y se graban en el subconsciente."
2,Average at Best...,"The first thing you should know about this video is that it is filmed live on a Marine Base and the audio is terrible (there is the constant sound of jets taking off in the background). When it comes to unarmed combat/self defence, I believe in the K.I.S.S. principal (Keep It Savagely Simple). Most of the techniques demonstrated in the video are FAR too complicated to work under stressful conditions. If watching a bunch of 18 year old robot recruits sloppily attempt to imitate an instructor teaching ...re-hashed martial arts is your thing... have at 'er. There are many books and videos out there which are worth your hard-earned cash - this isn't one of them. Check out the U.S. Marine publication: CLOSE COMBAT, it is far superior to the stuff shown on this video."
5,"Easy to use, good price","I had put off buying a backup hard drive because I thought it would cost too much. When a friend's laptop was stolen I finally got wise and picked up this drive for a great price. The software it comes with is easy to use, and I like being able to back up my entire system all at once. Highly recommend."
5,"EXCELLENT,Quality,Taste","I bought this to make chicken salad with.I am very happy with the quality of the taste,and texture,of this hormel canned chicken, it made a very tasty chicken salad.It was so good that there was none left!! i used two cans of this chicken and added two chopped boiled eggs along with diced pickles and mayo.I will buy this product again!"
2,no buying it again,it does not taste bad the problem is that it has no taste at all. than again what can you expect from canned chicken in water.
2,"Hormel White & Dark Chicken in Water, 95% Fat Free, 5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)","I bought this product to see if it would be useful for preparing meals for one. I used it to make an egg noodle, chicken, cream sauce dish. The can size was just about the proper amount of chicken for my dish. Was able to make a nice single serve entree. To bad the chicken was about tasteless. Parts of the chicken contents were tough and stringy. I think the 'fat free' processing caused the lack of taste. I gave a can of the chicken a ride in a food processor to make a chicken salad. Took a lot of seasoning and the addition of onion, pickle, etc. to produce any taste. The chicken just served as the carrier of the other ingredients.The cats aren't thrilled with it either.The shipping was prompt and the goods arrived damage free."
1,Not much meat in thee can,"Well it is sad to say this, because Amazon is usually a plus.The weight here is mostly WATER. The meat is real small pieces.Only fit for a cat."
5,I loved this book,"This isn't your typical romance novel. It's better. It has an interesting plot and the main female character is strong and intelligent. There were also parts that had me laughing. I hope there's a sequel, because even tho it had a good ending, I got so involved with the chartacters that I want to know what they do next."
5,Simply Awesome,"As I said the album is simply awesome. I had been looking for a recording of the song, ""I will Survive,"" and I finally found it. It is great. It is not the only great song on this album. There are many others. In fact there are 15 wonderful songs. But as with everything there is one problem. It sounds old. Like an old recording. But, anyway the album is well worth your money and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
1,pisssed.,"so i bought these subs and they showed up a fewe days late which is no big deal, but after the hours of work that i put intomy car to get these set up for it, during initial test runs we figure out that one of the ""brand new"" subs were broken and blown already. so i had to ship them back which took a week and it took them 2 weeks to recognize it and ship it back and another week for me to receive it, and they didnt upgrade me or discount anything. the ones i got afterwards work but the amp they come with is way tooo weak. i run a 600 with the 400 it comes with and push about 500 to each instead of 200 to each and it says way better. fyi"
1,VISONIK AMP Sucks,I hooked the amp up and it wouldnt do anything it has power in all the Places its supposed to major disappointment i dont even know how it sounds yet.
2,"Good features, poor quality, breaks down fast. Name the brand ""Oh, Brother!""","I bought this printer in March 2002 and the price was very right for the features. I particularly like the duplex printing feature. However, be forewarned that Brother does not provide good Mac support or drivers. Not all the features are supported on Mac computers.What I don't like is, the build quality is cheap cheap cheap. Very cheap plastic trays that don't slide in and out easily. When printing card stock, the stock gets caught on a lip on the back of the printer and will cause a jam if you don't stand there and manually guide & remove each page. On one occasion, a regular page got stuck in the drum and I had to replace it at a cost of over $150. Suddenly this printer is not such a bargain."
4,Awesome but...,"Great soundtrack, Great movie butmissing a few tracks such as ""Sussidio"" one of the key songs in the movie. The music is a key factor of Bateman's personality (or lack thereof). This is a must with so many great songs, but remember thats not all there is...."
3,Dissapointed with missing tracks,"I own this movie and have seen it many, many times with friends. The music from the film is GREAT! However, I'm slightly disappointed with the soundtrack. It is missing the true highlight songs of the movie by 'Phil Collins' and 'Huey Lewis'. It is also missing one of my favorites, ""I Touch Roses"" by 'Book of Love' which was played in the cab scene when he was taking Patricia (the strung out drug addict who passed out in her food at the restaurant) home. All and all, I give the soundtrack a 3 for the GREAT artwork on the casing and of course for the music it did not leave out."
1,this is a bad cd!,"i thought the music was boring and really and nothing to do with the moive. i saw the moive and i thought is was disgusting(i now that your thinking oh,she does like movies that are dark..well i do) and the acting was worse than 4 year olds ! my advice DONT BUY THIS CD!"
3,"Good, but not quite what I expected","This CD was sort of a disappointment. I was really expecting to see Huey Lewis and the News ""Hip to Be Square"" or Phil Collins ""One More Night"" and ""Sussidio."" I will say this- the CD is much better than the film. I really enjoyed Pump Up the Volume, True Faith and Paid in Full. It could have been better with more 80s tracks from the film. Fair Soundtrack album."
3,Just sort of eh,I found my copy at Wal-Mart with the Huey Lewis song still on it so that was a plus. but for the most part I didn't feel that the cd went well with the movie.On the version I have if you click forward long enough you can find Batemans Whitney Housten monolouge
1,I must be missing something?,This so-called sound track barely sounds like the movie I watched. The only good thing I had to say about the movie was the soundtrack....now I can't even say that:X What a big disappointment!
2,Needs to show position of stress accent.,"It's hard to believe that someone has actually written an Italian dictionary that doesn't show the position of the stress accent in words that don't follow the rules.Italian spelling conventions do not show it, so the learner needs to be able to look it up in a dictionary."
3,The title says it all. This is a BEGINNER'S dictionary.,"It has a very limited amount of words. I had to upgrade to another more inclusive dictionary (Webster's New World Italian Dictionary) and even that one sometimes disappoints. I guess for a beginner this dictionary might be good but if you are serious about learning Italian, you will very quickly outgrow this dictionary."
4,Old School Soul,"Excellent interpretations of some soul classics, a great accapella rendition of It's Alright, three gentlemen from St.Louis, Mo. delivering some fine singing."
5,The Collected Mystery Stories,"From his title ""The Grandmaster of Crime"" as written on the cover, Lawrence Block has compiled a delightful mix of over 70 of his short stories. He's taken shorts from his series characters Bernie Rhodenbarr, Martin Ehrengraf, Keller, Chip Harrison, and the ever-lovable Matthew Scudder. He's also added in a handful of fairly new stories as well as stories that were turned into full-length features like ""Sometimes They Bite"", ""Like A Lamb to Slaughter"" and ""Some Days You Get The Bear"". This is a must have for true Block fans, who will enjoy reading every last story!"
2,nowhere as brilliant as Geek Love...,"As Geek Love is one of my all-time favorites, I purchased Attic with high hopes. I was highly disappointed; it has some interesting passages, and some good character portraits, but it was overall a disjointed, self-indulging mess. Don't bother; read Geek Love again instead."
2,Company Does Not Honor Rebate Offers,"After repeated request, company has failed to honor rebate request."
3,It's an Ok maching,"This mp3 player works pretty well. It's easy to use but there are some minor problems. First of all you have to download the music through the printer port so you have to change cables often, and it doesn't support wma so you can only hold about 20 songs. There is no way to use an adapter with it so the batteries don't last to long. It's a good buy if you don't plan to use it for more then an hour."
2,how do you weight other people's opinions,"I saw that a few people gave this product a good review. But then most people who review an item on Amazon have nothing to compare it with. This product was pretty (bad). Cheaply made, slow (very) transfer rate, Limited memory (I'm a fan of the Creative Nomad - What is 64MB? Worthless unless you want to reload on a daily basis), Poor output Quality. This was the first MP3 player I ever purchased, and I used it for about 5 weeks before it just didn't turn on one day (yes, I replaced the batteries). There are many better products on the market, do waste your time."
1,"Cheap Price, Cheap Looking, Cheap Feel, Cheap Sounds","This was the first mp3 player purchase for me, and I was attracted by the agressive pricing for a 64MB player and the voice recording option. Once I received the product, the first impression was that it looked cheaply made, and not very solid looking. Sound was tinny, but I did not have another mp3 player to compare it against. Also, the jack was very sensitive, and a slight jostle or a certain angle would cause sound only to come out of one earphone. (not acceptible for my main purchase reason - portable player for running). I immediately returned the product and purchased the RIO500 with 64MB memory, and the quality, sound, build is leaps and bounds better than the Cabo. ..."
1,"The Cabo is terrible, The Company (Best Data) is Worse","I got the Cabo as a present....a present from hell. Do not buy this product. It's not so much that the player is crap - when it is working it sounds fine. The major problem is that if you have one you are screwed. The company who puts it out - Best Data - has the worst tech support and customer service that I have ever encountered. They charged me to help me with exactly nothing. What's worse is that you are forced to call them because the manual (best use for it is picking up after your dog) is terrible and their Web site is equally awful. Go with a player that has USB not a damn parrallel port. And Yes I am in ECP mode! Damn thing can't get in connect mode. Yes I went to file and selected connect and list. Still got errors, errors. I am getting a refund. Do not buy anythig from Best Data. You will get screwed, you will pay for horrible tech support, you will say I should have listened to that guy from Amazon."
3,Great player -if it works...,"I got this player a few weeks ago. I had minimal difficulty getting set up, thanks to the reviews listed below. Unfortunately, my player was one of the unlucky ones that had a bad headphone jack. Amazon was great about sending out a new one, but I barely made the rebate deadline -we'll see if I get it. The new player works great. The only software glitch I've encountered that's not listed is that it would lock up whenever I accessed my main file of MP3's. This was because the folder size was too large (~9.5 GB). After moving the MP3's to a smaller folder, I didn't have any more problems. Overall, it is a good deal if you have some patience and are willing to take a risk of getting a bad player right off the bat. If you're not a risk-taker or lack patience, I'd have second thoughts about this MP3 player. Hope this helps..."
2,"Price, with rebate, good. Features and performance not.","Got this machine yesterday. When I put in batteries and loaded software in computer I noticed that one complete line of data was missing in display of this Best Data MP3 Player. When the information scrolls across screen you can see, in the center of the display, that the LED's are not working for that column. Also, I downloaded 12 songs into the player. Both the display on the computer and the memory in the CABO said I had 30 Megs of memory left. I went to play songs and it would only play 6 of the 12 songs I downloaded. CABO couldn't locate the other six although they'd been downloaded to this unit. It sound good for what it can play but I can't understand why it doesn't display or play ALL the songs you download."
1,The Worst!,"I never write reviews but for this product I feel like it's my duty. If I can save one person from wasting their money on this then it will have been worthwhile.I would say that for 4 out of 5 tries, the cable does not connect to the player. And when it does connect, for some reason, it spontaneously stops working after downloading several tracks. I have tried this 100s of times so this is statistically relevant.Upon calling ther tech support, the person told me the best thing to do would be to return it to the store of purchase!"
4,"Good Buy, Great Price...","After reading all the comments posted by others who purchased the Cabo player, I wondered if some people received the same player I did. I had no trouble connecting, installing or transfering files. The software was simple to use and allowed for seemless transfers to the player. As for the sound quality the 14 tracks I loaded at 128Kbits came across with CD quality. The transfer rate, also, was quite a surprise. I averaged 1.38Mbyte/sec, yes that is megabytes. It took about 25 seconds to transfer a song, which I felt was very reasonable. My only complaint is that the headphones are not the greatest quality, but if you consider the price, spending [$] to get a nicer pair is not too bad. Also, if you want to look at the software before you buy the player you can download it for free from [bestdata]. With all things considered, I feel this player was a very good purchase."
1,Save your money,"This was my first MP3 player and I regret ever getting it. Not only did it have problems connecting to Windows XP, the quality was terrible. Besides, it's all about the iPod's these days. Look elsewhere before you even consider this thing!"
2,buy only if price is your number one priority,"well, i bought a cabo just because, well, it's cheap, and it has 64 megs of memory. i figured that at the worst, i could just return it if i was unhappy. unhappy is definitely what i was.the cabo isn't a horrible player, but it lacks a lot against new products like the rio 500. the main concern is upgradability. there really is none with the cabo. you accept the 64 megs you get, end of story.the other problem is the lcd display. a non backlit lcd really hurts your enjoyment of the unit in the dark, and it's pretty standard on most new players.on the good side, the sound quality is decent, and the headphones are very good for factory, but still, save up and buy a rio 500. leave the cabo for the bargain bins."
1,Do not buy it,"64M memory is not always availble. I formated the memory for 3 times. 1st time, 51M, 2nd time, 59M, 3rd time, 46M.The remaining part was always there, but not usable."
5,Good Product,"In my personal opinion, this is a pretty good product. Maybe the documentation is not good but I managed to download music and play them right after I got it without taking look at the documents. It is pretty easy I'd say. Sounds are pretty clear on this player. Download speed is about 750-900kb/sec which I think is pretty fast. Only thing is that the DSP mode is not quite good. Rock gives too much base while Pop does not give enough. Battery runs out a little fast but reasonable I guess. If you are using Win2000, you do not have to worry because BestData.com has win2000 driver to download. Overall, in terms of its price and its quality, I'd say it is worth buying."
2,Piece of junk,"After reading the reviews of many similar products, I decided on the Cabo MP3 player for many reasons. Price and memory were the two leading factors and the reviews made me believe I was making the right choice. I received my player yesterday and have had problems from the beginning. The item is flimsy and cheap feeling. The battery doors open with the slightest movement and my volume buttons do not work. To spend $$$ only to receive a broken item is frustrating. I would not recommend this player to anyone. On another note, the player connects to the computer through the printer port, an unfortunate mode of communication for people who have printers."
1,What a crappy MP3 player,"Don't waste your money[...]. Slow download, barely able to hold 12 songs, uses a batteries like it is free.[...]"
5,"Great, just needs a little work","I recently bought this Cambo Mp3 player so that I could listen to all my music anywhere, even during soccer. My first though was this thing woun't work, we'll, of course it didn't (if you have already read the other reviews). Mine had the little microphone jack problem (and yes it was in all the way) but, thanks to Amazons great return policy I was able to get a new one it about 8 days. Now this one works fine. This is a great product so I would buy it, not metioning the great price. Although it may not work the first or second time keep returning it. I also suggest downloading JazPiper 1.1.1.1 instead of using the provided software."
3,Didn't work right out of the box,"The headphone jack was not making good enough contact for the headphones to pick up any sound, so of course this makes the unit completely unusable. The company offered to replace the unit or fix it for free, so that is one good thing that came out of this. I was quite surprised, however, that it was broken before I even got to use it."
1,Don't do it,I purchased this product January 13th. My charge card was charged the full purchase price within minutes. Still 2/9/4 and no produce. I have emailed American Solutions twice so far and not even a confirmation response let alone and answer. Amazone says I must wait 30 days well that is four days from now and I want my money back.
4,"Expensive, but worth it in print results","The Brother Toner Cartridge is expensive, but worth not having the troubles that a cheap replacement cartridge can give you.Cheap replacement cartridges can give you headaches with leaks and could possibly destroy your Brother laser printer. You get what you pay for is the lesson here. I gave the cartridge a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star because of the cost. If Brother lowered the cost by 1/3 I would give it a 5 star rating."
4,You can't beat OEM,"I think it goes without saying ""buy OEM at the best price you can find"" and from the most reputable companies. As much as I have always tried to give the ""little guy"" as much business as I can, everytime I do. the ""little guy"" takes advantage of me.Just prior to ordering this product from Amazon I made the mistake of trying to save money with a small vendor and an ""equal"" product. I will have to throw it away with a loss of [...] and a non-responsive vendor.THANK YOU! - Amazon.com I appreciate companies that offer quality products at reasonable prices."
2,Not enough copies per cartridge,I had the same problem with these cartridges as the other reviewer. I think this especially stinks since you are stuck buying Brother ink cartridges if you own a Brother printer.
5,Good quality and lasts about as long as expected,"[Written 9/02] We have owned a Brother HL-1670N double-sided network laser printer for just over a year. We're just on our second TN-560 toner cartridge, so we don't have a broad experience base to judge against. However, the first one lasted 3,969 pages.. ..not bad considering how much graphics (B/W brochures, etc) we print. After the second cartridge was put in, there are random small marks on the page, maybe flecks of toner or paper just needs to be vacuumed out.Overall, this printer (toner/drum/etc.) has been one of the best office equipment investments we've made.[Update 11/03] Our second cartridge lasted 5,465 pages."
2,replacement toner,"This was not an OEM toner as I knew it wouldn't be. However, the quality of the refilled cartridge was mediocre at best,"
5,Great booster!,"This is a great little booster seat. It's very strong and sturdy and easy to clean. We have a high bar style table and my 2 year old is very secure in the seat. As other reviews said, it has adequate straps (three for your child and two for the chair) making it so the seat doesn't budge and even my strong toddler can't climb out. The seat also has some cushion so it seems comfortable to sit in."
4,My daughters seat,"I bought it for my daughter and the only complaint I had is that one of the ties was broken. but it was easy to fix and now works great! She loves the fact that it reaches the table. It was also great because it was weighted for her, some seats I found were only weighted to 30lbs and at three years old she is over that. She likes the colors and the pocka dots. It was a great buy!"
3,what is the purpose of this cd?,"it's not anything that anyone hasn't heard before, and you can get every song that's on here and more on Severe Tire Damage. I mean I understand the ""best of the early years"" cd is so that people can get to hear some early stuff without making a major expenditure on the Then: The Early Years 2 disc set, but this makes no sense. Granted, it's only about half as much as you would find the full length STD typically, but it's missing some key tracks (i.e. she's an angel, why does the sun shine?, the hidden Planet Of The Apes tracks etc.). It might seem like a bargain for about 7 bucks, but I reccomend that you shell out the full retail so you can get the whole thing. Even if typical cd retail is too much for you, I reccomend getting a tape of Severe Tire Damage rather than a cd of this... by the way it still gets 3 stars because it's TMBG and because even in abbreviated form, STD is still a good live cd."
3,Same as Severe Tire Damage,"This is just some of the live tracks of Severe Tire Damage, if you just want to hear their live stuff, get it. Nothing sparkly new here."
2,Check out my review for The Best of the Early Years,"I have just about the same thing to say about this album as I do for The Best of the Early Years (Not ""Then:""). BMG is just releasing half-a**ed discs to wring out some more money from the Giants. This album gets its second star simply for the fact that it's a collection of good songs. Severe Tire Damage is the way to go. Listen to the other reviewers."
4,Nice Add-On,"As an avid TMBG fan, I consider this disk essential. But, much like the Beatles 'Anthology' releases, it's a worthwhile completion of a collection, NOT a great disc to introduce you to TMBG or to add to the 1 or 2 other discs you own. 'Dr. Worm' is priceless, but the live material is, well... live. Everything on here is also on 'Severe Tire Damage' which has additional tracks, so consider grabbing it instead."
2,Hard to get used to,"In a sense, it works. However, the time it takes to get used to using it is quite an extensive process. I went out and bought the Lansky Garden Sharpener (for lawn mower blades, axes, hatches, etc. and it works great! Way better than this. I'll keep it around to use it if I have to, but nothing else."
5,as described!,turned out to be a pretty good sharpening stone. i've had it for about a month now and haven't ran into any issues with it.
5,perfect,"this was purchased to sharpen a dull axe that i had, it fits perfectly in your hand and makes sharpening so easy.Very durable..great purchase"
1,A 5 star production but for the lack of English subtitles,"I waited for years to see this on DVD, having watched the series on BBC TV - in French with subtitles in English. As soon as it appeared in France, I ordered it and anticipated the pleasure of seeing it again. Alas and merde, the lazy, arrogant so-and-sos who had made the DVD version had omitted to include English (or any) subtitles. What a large potential market they have missed. If they wanted to promote the French language, English subtitles would have taken this production to a far wider audience that the francophone one. Ah well ..."
4,Absolutely Wonderful and funky.,"I absolutely love their music especially ""Rock this funky joint"". It just puts me in another plane and is one of those songs that you just don't want to sit out. From the original release years ago until now, it still makes me wanna pull the car over and get down."
4,Pen can be fixed...,"I was very disappointed at first because the pen didn't work. I kept scratching it on paper and couldn't get the ink to flow. I finally took the pen refill out and dropped it in a bowl of hot water from the tap (not boiling water, but a little too hot to be comfortable). I came back in 20 minutes, took the pen refill out, and it immediately started writing.Would be five stars if the pen would work out of the box without having to do this fix. But I'm satisfied now that it does work and glad I didn't have to send it back. It is a cute little knife otherwise and the dim red LED is okay with me... red LEDs are more efficient, so the batteries should last a while, and the color and dimness will help preserve your night vision."
4,"Best of the ""Classic"" size","For everyday keychain duty, this is the mini-Victorinox to go with. The Classic is a classic for a reason; its blade, scissors, and nail file-screwdriver are the light tools you're most likely to need in a day, in the smallest possible pacage. The Signature Lite replaces the Classic's removable toothpick and tweezers with a pair of far more valuable tools: a ballpoint pen and an LED light.Neither is ideal; the light is relatively dim, by LED standards, and the pen isn't particularly comfortable for long-term writing, but having this SAK on your keychain is worth it: you'll never be without a pen or a light when you need one.Victorinox could sink a slam-dunk and get five stars if they'd use bright white LEDs instead of red ones (even if the knife cost a few bucks more). This is a good product, but LED technology's moved on, and Victorinox isn't keeping up like they could."
3,Gets old,"The first time you listen it's pretty good. After that, however, it gets kind of old. The fact that they only use computers is a major part of the problem; it limits their music to just pulsing beats and noise, thus the sound grows thin after a while. It might've helped if they knew how to play, say, a piano or a guitar. That said, the only songs that are still interesting to listen to are ""Fragments"" and ""Distant"", which aren't just all computer beeps."
5,Best VNV Nation CD!,"I've been a fan of them for years. I bought this for my bf, and he loved it! Thank you so much!!!"
4,Diamond blade works for various uses,I work for a paleontology lab that preps on dinosaurs. The rotozip blade cuts through the toughest concretions on the bones. I have several rotozips and use these exclusively. The only draw back is the dust.

1,Dullsville,"When I read the first five pages I knew I was in trouble. The writing throughout the book was very flat. Keeping track of all the characters was a monumental feat that left you wondering WHY they were actually written into this novel. About the only completely ""fleshed"" out character was Scott - The main character's lover who happened to be a Baseball athlete. Sprinkled adorations of this character created many stalls to the story line that I began to NOT care for Tom or Scott. I also found myself cringing at all the location descriptions given to the reader about Chicago. Again, this intricate location detail created a stall to my reading. Hasn't this writer figured out that less is more? Yet, I continued through the 182 pages HOPING to get some real writing style that would drive me to the entertainment value I get when reading a Joseph Hansen novel. How sad I was to see this book finish flat. Time to cleanse my brain with a Dave Brandstetter detective read. Oy...."
2,"Looks great, not as functional as desired.","Have had this for years now, with additional gifts at various times. Although I'd expected this to come in quite handy, I have found the scissors and knife not quite up to what I need at the time. (I probably use the tip of a ballpoint pen as well or better.)"
2,Cheap plastic tool,"The small knife no longer locks into the card, It generally is floating around in my pocket and I have to be careful not to stab myself.The scissor cover broke off a long time ago, and also floats around in my pocket.The pen is useless. Its diameter is so tiny, only the smallest fingers have a hope of operating it.It is a good idea, but I would wait for some much needed improvements to be made."
1,Worst of the credit card knives.,"There are a number of great credit card knives, (so called because they are when folded the size of a credit card) made by both S.O.G. which makes the ""Access card"", and Spyderco which makes the ""Spydercard"". The cost nearly is the same and the others have actual useful blades. This thing is cheap, cheap, cheap incomparison. Do yourself a favor and take a look at those others before buying this one."
2,Not that handy,"This card tool is very lightweight and very slim. The case is just not put together well. The plastic fastening is flimsy and falls apart pretty fast, especially near or on the hinge mechanism. Unless you treat this thing very delicately it will crack or break. It is not something you want to have in your back pocket wallet when sitting down.The knife, scissors, tweezers, and pen are all good tools and hold up nicely with continued use. The needle and the toothpick are more prone to getting lost than anything. The knife edge is not very sharp from the factory, and it is made of such strong steel and is so small, it can be a real challenge to sharpen. I suppose that is why they call it a ""letter opener"" rather than a cutting tool.If you expect to get a lot of use out of it, I recommend getting something with more solid construction."
1,fine for a few days,"When i bought this i was so happy, it was really cool but i kept it in my wallet and when i took it out to use it the cheap plastic that it is made out of broke so now everyting falls out."
3,cute,"Not as sturdy as I had expected; the instruments will not survive repeated use. But it's handy to have around in case of an emergency and makes a cute gift, tho a bit pricey."
2,Get a Leatherman Micra instead,"The Swiss Card is only useful if you need something to fit in a wallet. For a few dollars more, the Leatherman Micra has a much superior scissors, a better nail file, more screwdriver options, an easier-to-handle knife, and a bottle opener. The Leatherman Squirt is even better, and not that much more."
1,ordered as a christmas present,I ordered this for my husband for christmas but it still hasn't shipped...a week after new years! And product wasn't listed as backordered.
4,This thing is awesome!,"I bought one of these while on vacation in Germany about three years ago, and I keep it in my pocket pretty much all the time. I find myself using it for various little things a couple times a day. The pen stopped working pretty early on, though."
5,VER Y good book,"I bought this book to help me build and polish a cockney accent for my first acting role as an adult. I was cast as Alfred Doolittle in a local dinner theatre's production of My Fair Lady. My accent got the most favorable comments from the audience and fellow actors alike, many of whom asked me for pointers on pronunciation. This book is great, and speaking cockney has become so easy and natural to me that I find myself slipping into it without realizing it immediately. The pronunciation tips and examples were excellent. I cannot praise this book enough."
4,Good for Dipping Into,"I bought this book as an amateur trying to coach dialects to actors in my local theatre. As a native English person, the information comes across as quite dated - it gives the impression that we brits still all walk around in London with bowler hats and rolled umbrellas calling each other ""jolly good fellows"" - but I found it fairly easy to pick out the bits and pieces that I needed to give the actors a general overview of various dialects, with enough detail to present a convincing voice to an American audience."
1,Confusing and Offensive to Boot,"This book was practically useless. The author uses his own phonetic writing system, which I found difficult to understand and memorize, and without a CD, I had no way to verify that I was making the correct sounds.But what disappointed me the most was the use of broad ethnic stereotypes.For example, the practice monologue for the Chinese accent is all about doing laundry.Really?My copy went in the recycling bin. Save your money and buy a better book that comes with a CD."
2,"bulky, cumbersome","I bought this bag for taking to soccer games, skiing, and other outdoor activities. When it arrived I found it extremely capable of holding a lot of equipment, but perhaps too much so. I found it to be heavy, bulky and cumbersome. It appeared to be well designed, but I could not imagine using it as it was almost as large as the standard shoulder bag from Cannon strapped onto my waist. I returned it along with Tenba waistpack and kept the Kata Digital Rucksack and the Tenba Mixx Shoulder bag instead. If I didn't mind the weight, the design was nice and well thought out. Like my Kata backpack, the yellow inner fabric is wonderful for seeing what you have. I might recommend it for a person with a large build that can handle 10 lbs of drag on their waistband."
3,"Good quality, odd design","This bag, like all of the Kata purchases I've made, is made very solidly. However, this product seems to have a weird design and my camera does not fit in it unless I really shift stuff around. I wouldnt recommend it for a larger SLR... my 40D has trouble fitting with the lense attached. It'd probably be a better camcorder bag."
5,A Sex Researcher's Dream Come True...,"The Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures is the definitive, mammoth book of sex surveys and questionnaires.This book is a wonderful resource for social scientists and clinicians interested in assessing various aspects of sexuality using quantitative measures. The editors have done an excellent job compiling a wealth of instruments and have reported important information such as the reliability and validity of each measure, as well as copyrights and contact information of the authors/publishers of each measure. An incredibly broad range of areas of study is covered, often with more than one measure for each topic area. Greatly expanded and improved from the previous edition, it's an essential addition to any sexologist's library."
5,Excellent tool for Social Scientists,"Anyone with a comprehensive understanding of social sciences and anyone who is interested in doing research on human sexuality-this is an excellent tool. This book contains important and valid measures that do NOT in anyway support, condone, or justify sexual deviance like sex with animals or children. The tests in this book aim to measure aspects of sexuality."
3,J-Shin soulman lost in the slip-n-slide empire,"J-shin has both an amazingly smooth voice and a rare hip-hop blues infused delivery to match on this single as well as on his cd ""My Soul, My Life"" which is available on Slip-N-Slide Records now. I suggest you pick this one up because he is a diamond in the rough that is not likely to be picked out any time soon because of his membership in a label mostly known for thugged out rappers such as Trick Daddy and Duece Poppito, as well as Booty Queen Trina. Pick this up as well as J-Shin's entire cd. It's good and rare. Get it Today."
4,"Interesting, but rat is too small","The product is interesting, but the rat seems a bit too small and can be detached from the house. Prefer it to have a string secured to the house."
1,"Nothing new, just another anti-semitic book.","When author is afraid to name who is really responsible (and we are not stupid, we know who hijacked those airplanes) he's blaming a victim. Nothing new, just another anti-semitic book.Besides this book looks REALLY stupid after three intelligence officers said this year that the U.S. military intelligence had identified lead 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta as a member of al-Qaida who might be part of U.S.-based terror cell long before the terror attack: ""a classified military intelligence unit called ""Able Danger"" identified Atta and three other hijackers in 1999 as potential members of a terrorist cell in Brooklyn, New York. Defense Department lawyers rejected the unit's recommendation that the information be turned over to the FBI in 2000."". This is liberal lawyers as usual always protecting terrorist's rights.But, anti-Semites already bought this book :-)..."
1,Suspension of belief required,"You have to go through some incredible mental acrobatics to believe the allegations put forth in Mr. Raimondo's book. It is a book that will be loved by those who enjoy a good conspiracy read, or those who see Elvis occasionally."
1,Raimundo Rants Again,"Justin Raimundo, whose ramblings can be regularly viewed on content suspect sites such as antiwar.com, spews more of his anti-USA rant. A gigantic waste of time and money for anyone with a little more on the ball than his usual readers."
1,laughable at best!,My five year old son could write a better book. Buy this book and waste your money if want too though.
5,Detailed and documented - a must read,"This book will shock many people and many will think it's crazy conspiracy theory BS. It is not at all.It is well researched and factually based. The author uses articles and research from mainstream media sources; he could have used reports from alternative media which would have presented even more evidence of this 9/11 connection, but he chose to stick with more ""credible"" sources. What is really disgusting and scary is that the mainstream media covers up these well documented facts. Justin Raimondo is one courageous guy. Unfortunately for Raimondo and the US Public, this story will never get very far because the forces to supress it are way too powerful."
5,Well presented interpretation from a GURU,Justin has always excelled in uncovering what the US government and its instruments would like to keep away from the public.He is spot on as usual.Keep it up Justin
2,Mediocre,"I picked this up after reading numerous positive reviews. Unfortunately, the material did not even come close to living up to the hype. On this album, Gross starts out reasonably well - and there is hope that he will find his rhythm and gain momentum - but he soon slides into predictable mediocrity. There are a few noteworthy moments, but all-in-all, this is pedestrian stuff, and those moments are too infrequent to justify a recommendation."
2,Brief and Uneven,"This book attempts to describe the presidents humour, but ultimately leaves the reader wanting more. I appreciate the fine anecdotes about Lincoln;however, I expected more tidbits from the recent presidents. The author seems biased in favor of certain presidents he finds amusing. A compendium of presidential humour should have more balance."
3,Historically Funny,"Here's an entertaining little book that could have been a real blockbuster. The best aspect of this book is that it presents the various personalities of our former presidents, so you get to know them in a personal way instead just a boring listing of their accomplishments. It also reveals how incompetant and ill-equiped for office some of them were. Although worth the time, this tidy book could have been so much more."
4,Wit and humor from our presidents.,"Indeed I wish Bob Dole was in this book, instead of reporting on the wit and humor of the highest office's previous occupants. I believe humor and the ability to laugh at yourself is a great asset with any person in high office. When Dole lost in 1996, he stated he slept like a baby....he cried all night.The book is structured on rating the president's ability to crack jokes. Many people believe that Lincoln and FDR had great wits. Dole states the many unknowns such as Coolidge's jokes about his silence. Some of our underrated Presidents had great wits.This is a nice little humorous read. If the reader needs an uplift, this is a great book to begin with."
4,Classic Brazilian bossa and samba vocals,"This CD combines two albums by Brazilian samba-bossa singer Elizeth Cardoso, ""A Meiga Elizeth, v.3"" from 1963, and ""A Mulata Maior,"" from 1974. These albums both originally came out on the Copacabana label, and while their pairing seems to be somewhat random (since so many other albums came out between them, also on Copacabana...) but the music itself is sure to make fans happy. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
3,Wrong CD Crazy Band,"I thought it was a Funeral Oration CD from the Ampsterdam Punk band, it is not. Though, this is crazy italian metal and it's pretty good. Not what I thought, but still enjoyed it."
4,In his fathers footsteps,"Peter is the son of the most famous swedish jazz player, Lars Gullin. Chet Baker wrote this about Lars: ""The only baritone player that I was aware of was Gerry Mulligan. When I heard Lars, I thought, Jesus, there is another way of playing the baritone!"". Peter playes a lot like his father but has his own style to."
3,Not what I expected,"It is cute but makes me look too old. I have a round face and short hair, this is not the right hat for me."
3,Serves a purpose,Still trying to decide how to wear it. If it is windy it will not stay on. It has been crushed and stuffed on a shelf but still manages to keep its shape.
5,One of Katherine Kingsley's better books!,I really enjoyed this book especially Ali! Andre was a little hard to swallow sometimes because he was always obsessing over the dead love from his teen years that almost bordered on the warped! But Ali's personality in the book still made me give it a 5 star! She was the shining star in the book!
1,Diet Helper,"Not what I was hoping for, sorry I didn't like this program it is confusing to use and doesn't do what I thought it would do am just glad I didn't pay allot ofr it."
5,great interval training,Step aerobics is my favorite exercise routine and I loved this dvd. I not only got a great workout the time flew by. The instructor was great! I would love to take her classes. There is plenty of room to modify up or down - you can't beat that.
4,an action movie with a woman,I like movies that have some action in them. But what I really like in this movie is that it is a women that is strong willed and can get it done. Most movies have the man as the risk taker but the stunts and effects in this movie make it fun to watch.
3,Pretty Good Action Flick,"This movie was pretty good as a sequel to to the first one. Of course it doesn't measure to the video game, but usually the films don't."
2,BAD,"This movie was baaaaaddd. Maybe it was just me cuz i was so excited for it cuz it looked good from the previews, but it still wasnt that good. But at least it was better than the first which was horrid ( how did it make so much money????)."
1,Absolute Hollywood Garbage!,"Tomb Raider 2 has got to be one of the worst pieces of garbage I have had befoul my DVD player. The script has no thought whatsoever and is utterly predictable. Not to mention it seems to drag on for what seems like an eternity. The characters are paper thin, reminiscent of old MacGyver and A Team episodes. This movie is nothing more than a comic book with lots of cheesy special effects. This is just Hollywood trying to be trendy and cool. Sure, Angelina Jolie looks good, but that's about it for this movie! Instead, rent an adult film. At least that way you might have a plot! If your looking for a movie that requires more thought capacity than the average 3 year old, LOOK ELSEWHERE!"
1,not that into it,"I watched the first Tomb Raider a few days ago. I didn't really care for it. I just finished watching Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. I thought it was going to be better then the first movie. It was better, but still not into it."
3,Don't go for the acting,"The acting in this movie was a mess. It wasn't as good as the first Lara Croft movie. The plot on the other hand is worth noting. I loved the idea of the movie, the cradle of life. It spices up the boring life of Lara into a show. The plot also has many twists and exciting climaxes that you are sure to enjoy. But lara croft is a disapointment so if your a fan of hers don't get excited. I did however enjoy this film. Its worth five bucks to go to a matinee"
3,What an improvement!!!,"Whoever was her speach coach should get an award. Her fake English accent was so much more better the second time around. I enjoyed the movie and it was fun. ***Bias*** I think she's hot. As long as the movie around her didn't suck all too bad, I was going to be content. Movie didn't suck too bad. Plot was pretty much Standard Operating Procedure so it was about what I expected."
3,Better than the first - but not by much.,"Sure, this film is better than the first member of the Tomb Raider series. Unfortunately, the first put the bar so low that it doesn't take much to improve on it. Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life has a better story, better action sequences, and better dialogue but it's basically the same. The writers and directors improved on the detail, but not the big picture which leaves you wondering if there really is anything to improve. The only saving grace of this movie is Angelina Jolie, who really seems to like the story and puts in a gutsy performance. Other than that, the film is uninspiring. If you got a mild kick out of the first movie like I did, and considered it an amusing summer diversion, you'll probably be bored with the second. If you haven't seen the first, you should rent this instead, and leave your Tomb Raiding at that."
2,Another nail in Hollywood's coffin,"An earthquake in Greece provides access to an undersea temple where a dispirited and humorless Angelina the archaeologist vandalizes the best find since Tutenkhamun, making off with an orb which provides the clue as to the whereabouts of Pandora's box wherein resides the stuff from which life was created - simultaneously being sought by an evil scientist who wants to take over the world. That sounds a reasonable enough concept for a Hollywood movie, but with predictable skill our Californian friends drain even this miserable ""Raiders of the lost ark with a woman"" theme of any redeemable qualities. A couple of hours playing the videogame is likely to be infinitely more interesting and rewarding. Sad, because the first Lara Croft movie, with a much more upbeat and sexy Lara, was fun."
1,Lin1,"I was very disappointed with this second edition. My daughter and I loved the first action filled movie and had hoped this would be just as exciting. The movie dragged out for the first half, and just got worse during the second half. I continually kept looking at the clock, wondering when it would be over. We only watched it once, and it will go in the rummage sale later this year."
1,Why? Why would they do this to us?,"I liked the first Tomb Raider, and was thoroughly disappointed watching this movie. Angelina Jolie's character, Lara Croft faces almost impossible tasks. Some of them stupid.The worst part of this movie is when Lara Croft goes underwater for five minutes, and still has time to quickly punch a shark and ride it up out of the water. It is a ridiculous movie.If you think that this movie will still be good, and you want to ignore this review, please do not make this movie a blockbuster and make them make a third installment in this bad series."
2,Tomb Raider: A Waste of time and Money$$$,"This film was the most dissapointing film of the summer. It wasn't the worst, but it was just a waste of everyone's valuable time. Where to start. Lara croft,is played by Angelina Jolie. She's beautiful but this role hasn't spread her range as an actress. The video game based sequel has Croft in search of an ancient artifact called Pandora's Box, ""The most powerful thing ever imagined."" I'm getting tired of the same old plot of an ancient artifact being searched for. Why can the plot be about how the audience can give a damn about this film. The visuals are nice, but there so boring and repitive that i almost fell asleep. The ending is boring as well. At least this film is better than the original. But not by much. I'll just rather play the new ""Tomb Raider"" game that came out this year. Oh yeah that sucks too."
5,Just as good as the game!,"If you like the game, you will love this sequel! Lara's up to her usual perseptive self encountering bad/good guys and nailing their intentions on the head each and every time! Interesting characterizations and the storyline blended with dynamic action scenes makes this sequel the best one yet for Tomb Raider fans!Go see it! Make yourself at home in Lara's world and you'll not be disappointed!"
3,it was great but Indy still rules!!!!!,"I admit that I thought this movie was great after seeing the first one whitch wasn't that good. It had some great action scenes and great cast. I was on the edge of my seat for some of the movie. The only thing I have to say is .... INDIANA JONES RULES!!!!all three movies had excitment, action and adventure. What is trully missed by today's Adventure movies. My opinion save your money and wait two years for a real adventurer Indiana Jones 4"
3,Lara Croft is gorgeous...,"...but the movie falls short of my expectations. I know, it's hard to make a sequel that is as good as the original, but I can hope for it."
2,as awful as it gets,"There's no plot, there is no acting, and the ""movie"" comes across as either a gassed-up fashion show or -yes- a video game that quickly gets out of control. Until the next James Bond monstrosity arrives, this one holds a most-motorized-stuff-per-scene prize.I gave it 2 starts instead of for one single reason -- I had a great bout of laugher at one scene where our heroine literally punches a charging great white shark (!) in the nose (!) to fend off its attack. I rest my case. And there are quite a few more laughable moments to enjoy before falling asleep. With its constant smugness and fake ""coolness"" this movie redefines the meaning of ""awful""."
1,What a disapointment....,"When I saw Lara croft: Tomb Raider the first one, I wonder that it's sequel would be spectacular...2003 arrived and Cradle of Life was released... I could'nt believe in what i saw... what a miserable piece of movie!!!! No action, horrible direction, even worst script... The only thing that I enjoyed when I was watching this crap was the Goddes Angelina Jolie, in that tight neoprem clothe....anyway, she is the only reason for you to see this film..."
2,Major Let Down,"I liked the first movie a lot more than this in my opinion ""pitiful"" sequel. I saw both when they were in theaters and the second one just didn't have enough kick to it. I thought Lara came off looking weaker in this film and I definately could have lived without that .. um .. somewhat indecent scene that really added nothing to the storyline on a whole. Lara just seemed a lot cooler in the first movie. I did buy the first movie but I don't think I'll buy this one."
3,Angelina Jolie action hero,"Lara Croft as played by Angelina Jolie is a female cross between James Bond and Indiana Jones. Angelina joins the ranks of Harrison Ford, Bruce Lee etc. as a natural action hero. Sure the film doesn't make much sence but Angelina makes it worthwile. This is her calling."
2,Uninspired sequel.,"I greatly enjoyed the first Tomb Raider movie and gave it 4 stars. But this movie i cannt recommend...Laras old boyfriend, who has a very annoying accent, takes up way too much of the time and both of them never seemed to have much chemistry from the beginning.And the action. What action?The first movie had some tremendously fun action scenes while this one had one or two 'cool' parts and thats it. How many times can we really see Lara arrive or travel by skydiving/etc?This movie is a very sub par action flick and it comes across very flat and dull in most parts. Stick with the first Toomb Raider if you want some decent adventure."
4,Loved it,"More action. More great travels and another adventure. It seems Lara Croft is even more sexed up in this film, but she hasn't lost her touch or her composure even in the face of danger. That's my girl.I suppose it does help that she has an equally sexy and adventurous boyfriend to help her out, although he wasn't always rooting for the good side. The sequel packed more stunts and punch to its plot, but the first one gave her more grace.Either way, Croft still dives right in to her adventures head first while the rest of us are left chattering and arguing away her amazing feats. Maybe we're the ones missing out."
1,Raid another tomb please...,"After viewing the original Tomb Raider, which I considered one of the worst movies to come out that year, you'd think I'd save my money on the sequel. WRONG! There were some toys from the movie I'd seen of some monsters or creatures or something and they drew me out. While they were cool and the movie was better than the original, that's not really saying that much.Lara Croft finds some sunken treasure from Alexander the Great beneath the ocean, which includes a sphere that looks like a bowling ball made of amber. She looses it to some other treasure hunters and finds out that it's a map to the Cradle of Life, where Pandora's Box is kept. The ""bad guy"" wants the box to sell as the ultimate weapon so Lara's got to go save the day. The monsters I described above are the guardians of the box. They're cool for the split seconds you get to see them, but the rest of the movie isn't worth your money."
2,What the hell are you people talking about?,What are you people on? This was a terrible movie; I just saw it an hour ago. It was one of the biggest wastes of time I have ever spent on a movie. It had no plot line; all it was was an excuse to see Angelina Jolie jump up and down with a bad British accent. The jumping up in down deserved a three star but the accent and the constant introduction of dumb characters drop it to two.
1,Movie Fan,"""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" is, quite possibly, the worst movie I have seen since... well, since ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider."" The plot is flimsy, the acting is flat, and the action is so self-consciously ""cool"" it comes off as stupid and cartoony-- the audience never feels like Lara Croft is in any kind of danger. I sat through the entire movie without registering a single human emotion. A must to avoid."
1,Really disappointed,"I realize you shouldn't expect much from a video game remake, but good gravy.The dialogue is flat and rarely funny or interesting. The plot is completely incomphrehensible. The villian's motivation makes no sense. I don't want to blow the ending for you. But a key character who is likable from the beginning has a two-second morality meltdown and becomes a one-dimensional baddie for no other reason than Lara has commitment issues.If you're thinking of buying this one, just go out and get another version of the video game. You'll be happier."
3,Plot kills 2 stars,"Again, like the first one, the plot is so/so, the movie however is good, again it is for video game fans, adults might frown but teenagers will get a kick out of it. The action sequences in the end of the movie seem to move too slow. The movie is moving fast through scenes. The only problem i had with the sequel, was that they used too much make up on Angelina Jolie, because in the first movie, she had more a action girl look, you know a little rough up in the face, and Angelina Jolie has kind of baggy eyes. In the sequel, they seem to use so much make up to smooth Angelina's face. Again Angelina is doing most of her stunts, that's what make Angelina so great in the movie, fans appreciate that Angelina is giving so much effort. The movie is at perfect length, the action sequences are well placed, video game fans will like this high tech sequel."
3,Action galore with some hot romance along the way,Croft is out for adventure and action again and Jolie fills the billvery well. The stunts and special effects are good especially the flightoff the tallest building in HongKong. This time Lara has company in avirile and sexy scottish actor named Gerard Butler. He gives her plentyof competition in their action shots and some very sultry scenes in theromance department. I thought the ending was a cope out and thought thealternate ending made more sense.
4,Enjoyable sequel,"Angelina Jolie does a nice job as Lara Croft (again) and this movie was fun to watch. It's not the greatest movie, but the story is enjoyable and decently-done, and the special effects and action scenes are a pleasure to see."
2,Seriously,"All I can say is;why watch this when we can watch Indiana Jones?The only good part in the entire movie is when the unseen people come out of the woodwork, other than that, I though the movie was a complete waste of my time and energy. Talk about chick flicks, this was definatly made just for a guys enjoyment. The entire movie revolved around Angelina Jolie and her body. The action stunk, she never got hurt except for one small slice on her leg, and can one really punch a shark in the nose and then ride on its back? I'm thinking not.If action is your thing, and plots are not than this movie is completely for you."
1,"Like the first, this second part also put me to sleep","If you're one of those guys who has dreams of dating Lara Croft from the PC games, then you might like this movie. As for normal men and women, they'll hate this movie."
2,Are you kidding me?,"Without Jolie's good looks NO ONE would buy this DVD. She uses a terrible British accent and relies heavily on her looks which of course include her famous D smoking lips. One word: DUMB. Thumbs down on his one, unless you are 10 years old."
3,German Version,"I will be returning my copy - I wasn't aware that the entire version would be in German - English is available as a second audio but it sounded muddied, and what I really needed was English subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired but only German was available, so that makes this a no-go for me. Otherwise shipping was fast and the product wasn't damaged in any way."
2,Recycled action,"Thrill seeking archaeologist and explorer journeys to an underwater temple that leads to a sphere containing Pandora's box. Someone wants to use the box for evil, and Laura has to try to stop him!!! I felt like I was watching a female version of Indiana Jones. The one scene I really enjoyed were those monsters coming out of the trees, but even that reminded me of a scene from Mortal Combat. The movie was too recycled and had no originality."
3,Indistinct markings and sharp handle edges,"I use this 1 gal ""cup"" for home brewing - transferring wort, cleaner, etc. Aluminum is probably better than the plastic containers I have used in the past. Normally I don't use it to measure anything, so the indistinct rings on the inside that show quarts is no big deal for me. The thin and sharp handle is another matter - its hard to hold and carry a full gallon comfortably. (I've wrapped mine with duct tape.) It does pour nicely in any direction. Now that I know what's what, I'd gladly pay a few more bucks for a stainless steel container with a better handle."
5,Great accessory for all-grain setup,"Like other users, I saw this on sale at Homebrewfinds.com. Glad I did. Simple, lightweight, and vital to all grain brewing if you don't have a pump. Should have grabbed two!"
4,Very Good and Unconventional Science Fiction,"This book is an interesting combination of pacifist-Quaker tract, coming of age novel, and post-holocaust science fiction. The story is set in a near future after a nuclear holocaust-nuclear winter. There are small colonies of survivors in communities maintained by enigmatic aliens, whom some survivors suspect of triggering the holocaust. The main character is a young woman coming to maturity in a community of survivors in Pennsylvania, a community where many survivors are Quakers. The point of the story is the necessity of pacifism and Quaker respect for life beliefs. The characterization is convincing and the author's depiction of this future is equally convincing. The quality of writing is very good."
3,It Could Have Been Better!!!,"It was funny and cute in the beginning, then later, it just got crazy and cunfusing! The Mob use a cute Welsh terrier to lead them to find their stuff. Bill Denny walks in and the dog decides to go with him. When he forgets his anniversary, his wife thinks he got the dog for her. Soon, the Mob are out looking for the dog! This movie will make you hate mother-in-laws! I probably wouldn't recommend that you BEHAVE YOURSELF!!!"
4,What will happen next?,When husband (Farley Granger) forgets his anniversary he tries to buy a quick present for his wife (Shelley Winters) but ends up with a gangster's dog instead. Of course she falls in love with the dog which causes her husband problems at every turn. He spends the entire movie trying to rid himself of the dog only to become entangled in several murders. This movie will have you laughing from start to finish.
2,"Not very funny, interesting locations","Although I like the actors in this movie I found it rather boring. It is a pretty unfunny comedy which probably has aged badly. There is some interesting 1950s modern Californian architecture on display, though, which is of some historical interest."
3,Too many velcro attachments in wrong place,"I found this cover easy enough to install, though a little awkward for one person. It looks good, fits well but.. I'm having an issue with water pooling along the sides in between the velcro attachments. I would have preferred to have less velcro to the angled supports and more on the edges to pull the canvas taut."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this replacement canopy...don't waste your money. The velcro was set to high up to attach to frame. Poor stitching...had to use ties to attach to the velcro to attach it to the frame. Nothing to hold the corners on with. First windy day and everything came off. The original canopy was made out of canvas, it lasted through 2 summers. This one lasted 4 weeks. Very poor quality."
1,not happy,"At first, the canopy seemed fine. It fit nice and was easy to put up. 2 days later, the winds picked up and ripped almost all of the velcro attachments of the main part of the canopy. The velcro is not attached on any reinforced material, not even a seam. There are a few stitches holding it on light canvas type material. Don't waste your money if you live in a windy city."""
2,Work as OEM,"First of all this product do fit just as bad as the OEM equipment. The original design is no better than this. Don't to find a better product for you gazebo. Just another brand of gazebo that makes a better top.Pros: WorksCons: don't fit. You can make it fit, but will tearThis product is not bad. It just the OEM product was bad therefore any copy of the OEM will be bad."
2,Not so bloody,"Funny in a juvenile way. So so gore. Basically a bride objects to her groom consummating their marriage on their wedding day so stabs him to death. Then meets up with another fellow on the rebound and sets about emasculating him on the way to their wedding, ie no night out with the lads, no stag do etc. However, his mates ignore her so she decides the knife is the best way to restore order. Cheap budget, one topless stripper and frat style type humour. Under no circumstances mistake it for the far superior Blood Splattered Bride!"
5,professional slide show,"such a great moments spent watching this interesting biography, I liked it. The music attached to the slide shows and the scenes also were beautiful. couple of music tracks were added for listening which is great."
2,somewhat overstated.,"there are some good shots and some mediocre shots. some shots of dawn and dusk are superb but the shots of birds and wolves are somewhat ordinary which anybody can shoot using a telephoto lens. i somewhat cannot believe that he shot only one photo a day considering that you usually bracket shots using film because you do not know the outcome of the shoot and is unbelievable to see some tricky shots as dusk without bracketing and claim to do it with only one shot a day. he also did not mention what lens, aperture and speed he used for each photo or his techniques in doing the shots. the video would be believable if it was done during the 90 days that he was out in the field."
1,You get what you pay for,"I've never written a bad review before, but I feel I should in order to warn others. This is a very cheap cue rack that was chipped in a few places and even had a long split in one of the boards. Don't go by the color of stain in the picture, it is very misleading. It is a much darker color when you get it. Don't waste your money on this! Spend the extra money and get one thats going to last."
1,Absolute junk! DO NOT BUY!,"Flimsy, poorly made, absolutely impossible to put together properly because it's poorly made, this item is strictly for people who've gotten tired of tearing their money into pieces, or using it to light their cigars. Indefensible crap."
4,love it!,So cute! And pretty comfy. I wore them to a wedding and got a lot of compliments. I love the old-time fashion!
2,Sent for repair...but still LOVE this watch!,"I LOVE this watch...unfortunately, I sent it in for a warranty repair (condensation accumulated within the lens). It took about three months to get the watch back. They do stand behind their product, but it takes a LONG time to get it back. I have gone diving with this watch atleast 15 times and it keeps very accurate time. The mother-of-pearl face is really stunning.This is the 1st watch I've owned that I can honestly say I LOVE."
3,"Good reading, but not updated for today.","This book was informative for basic info, like direct selling companies and marketing.It lacked more updated info for websites and selling directly on the internet which is so important in this day. It's over 5 yrs old."
4,Inspiring and provoking book.,"This is a wonderful book and rings of truth. A companion book to this should be the wonderful ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by Richard G. Patton. Patton's book reveals further information about the true use of the Pyramid for Initiation. ""The Stone of the Plough"" is a clear light that many will heed while many will discard it as fantasy. I loved it as a straight forward read, but found it resonated beyond the basic plot. You will enjoy this book."
2,"Probably works on some stuck bolts, did not work for me","I got these to try to get out several stuck and broken bolts. Needless to say, it did not work. They are not strong enough and broke. I got a $4 bolt extractor set from a tool store, and they got two other bolts out. I wish that I had done that first, instead of buying a more expensive one that did not work for me. Yes, I could probably send the broken one in and get a replacement. Just to have it break again? Better to save the postage."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"All of a sudden, people's internal combustion engines are one hell of a lot more combustible. Hard to drive when your fuel is blowing up on you.Tintin sets out to investigate, as the Captain is off on a mission. The Thompson twins are also on the case.Tintins investigations and sneaking lead him to Dr Muller."
1,blandly constructed,"I found it hard to read for any stretch of time. The story is not true Herge. It feels half-hearted and forced. Like a number of Herge's later books, this one feels very topical like Herge was searching for a story."
4,I bought Videowave 3.0,"and was impressed with my first, simple video - a series of movie clips and stills set to music from a cd. My experience is that the program has a tendency to freeze up my computer (a 400 mHz laptop pc, 128M RAM) the first time I run the software and begin taping, but after restarting a couple of times, it works fine. So far I've only captured video from television and VHS format tapes, which is easy to do. The software is not complex, but there are a some things you just have to learn through trial and error. I would recommend this software - it's a good value and it's not difficult to get professional results."
4,"Enjoyable, fun and easy.","Originally bought this to upgrade VideoWave SE that came with my Iomega Buz analog capture card. Unfortunately it was not compatible with the hardware. Well my analog camcorder died and I ugraded to a Sony digital 8 and a firewire card. Have been using 3.0 now for 4 months making home videos and the familiar interface from SE has been added plus. Haven't had time to dig too deep into this program but for making quick home movies, it is easy to use if you at least take a quick look at the instructions or use the packaged tutoring cd. The only problem I've had is when I plug the camera in or turn the camera on after the program is started, most of the time it does not recognise the camera is there. So, make sure your camera is plugged in and turned on before you open the program. Other than that I have not had any problems."
3,Expectations not quite met,The actual colors are a little duller and there isn't as much bling to the actural product as there is on the picture. It's still a beautiful belly ring but not quite perfect for me. The shaft is too long and the front part too heavy so it weighs the whole thing down and front and makes the upper part of the shaft show... I like the inverted models because they accentuate the 'accessory' part without accentuating the 'pierced' part but this doesn't do the job quite as well.
3,Tennis Lite Scorekeeper,"This is a nifty little device, with a few caveats. The hooks on the back aren't designed well for hooking onto your shorts, and consequently the device will occasionally fall off. The scorekeeper can take about three falls before the two halves of the clamshell fall apart and you have to glue it back together (very carefully or you'll glue the scoring parts in place - a mistake I made). The deuce indicator on mine was very loose and tended to switch settings on its own. Still, the only other pocket scorekeeper I've come across is double the price and apparently to be kept in the pocket, not on the waistband, which I think is far more convenient."
5,Beautiful,"This is Esteban's first collection of Christmas standards, performed on his classical guitar with backing accompaniment. This is a disc you can put in your player on repeat mode at Christmas time (or anytime for that matter, it's that good) and enjoy it over and over. I would imagine that should you have company over and this disc was playing in the background, someone would ask you who they were listening to. Esteban's passionate classical-style playing combined with his arrangements and the production on this collection packs these holiday standards full of emotion. Most of the tracks are lengthy, averaging about 7 or 8 minutes long, but the music's so beautiful, you don't really notice the length. Definitely in my Top 10 holiday album list, no- make that Top 5!"
2,Too dry,I was pleased to see the acceptable price of the rum cake. I was disappointed by the fact that the Tortuga Cake does not have the expected rich flavor. It seems that the manufacturer saved some money by using less rum as an ingredient.The other issue arises with the dryness of the cake. My recommendation would be to have a full glass of water for every bite you take. I have had a better rum cakes before.
4,A good old classic book!,"I love the fact that i can download all kinds of classic books on my Kindle for free. I downloaded this book to read to my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it. Although she is from the ""digital age"", she enjoyed the author's human take on what it might be like to be a cat. I only gave the book 4 stars because of the difficulty younger readers might have reading it. It was written in 1857 by an English author whose style is probably a little too sophisticated for 21st century children (which is a shame). That being said, if the book is read with the help of an adult it is a fun and timeless read, and, did I mention? It's currently FREE! :)"
3,Good for low-intensity days,"The Women's Health and Fitness Network marketed the FitPrime series as a fusion workout designed for women over 35. The good points: The DVD's production values are great: the cueing, music and the set all contribute to a cohesive product.The not-so-good points: While the Metaboost workout was definitely a good mix of pilates, cardio, yoga and weights, it wasn't as intense as I expected - and I was using 10 and 15 lb weights already. The Flex Posture workout was in the same grade, but the modifications demonstrated by the instructor made the exercises easier. I expected that the instructor would demonstrate the full form and the rest of the exercisers would show different modifications.I would recommend these workouts for the less-intense periods in a workout cycle. For more intense weight training, I would recommend Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weights Vol. 2."
3,MetaBoost - What a Boost! and FlexPosture - Tackling the Th,"Slow and deliberate. Those are the two words I most apply to this workout. The tempo lets you really work a move. And, for such a deliberate pace you really work up a sweat.I found the clams and the one leg plies with balance option particularly tough. These two moves are something that you can really make it your goal to conquer.The set is visually stimulating and the music really works well with the moves.I give this workout a B+.FlexPosture - Tackling the Third Component of FitnessStretching which increases flexibility is the most neglected component of Fitness.This workout admirably tackles this issue.Do not expect a heart thumping aerobic workout. You will not get it here. What you will get is your muscles work in a different way, a less impacted way.For those of you who care about increasing your flexibility and strength through none impacted ways (Pilates and Yoga), this is an excellent workout. I give it an A.Saundra"
3,Not what I excepted!,"I have been using the Firm since 1988. I still use volumes 1, 2 and 3. Very effective, but my body is very use to the routines. I figured this would be a good change and hopefully bump up results. The DVD's are sloooowwwwww. You bearly work up a sweat. One of the moves on Flexposture is power sitting!?!?! Come on...I don't have time to waste sitting, I do that all day at work. The DVD's well made and thought out, just not for me."
2,I didn't break a sweat,"I have worked out for many years and used both the old Firm work outs and FitPrime's original workouts. These two workouts are very easy, and like some of the original FitPrime workouts, a little clumsey. They are ok for the days you don't want to work too hard, but you may have to do both to feel like you've done anything. In fact I tried to find out if they were designed for older women, but found no information about that. I am older--past 50 and I found them a yawn."
2,Pooh-lover disappointed!,I bought this for my little one who loves Pooh. The program doesn't do a whole lot and it isn't too intuitive for a toddler. We have Reader Rabbit Baby/Toddler and she can do a lot more in it.
2,Disney Winnie the Pooh,"I brought this CD for my 3 year old who has got a hang of the computer. He has been using Barney interactive earlier on, which I highly recommend to every parent. My son was trying with the mouse and its really not as good as expected. He got frustrated with it pretty fast. I suggest Disney takes a look at the Barney Interactive CD's."
3,Getting Started,"I bought this for my 9 mth old daughter. She is not real interested in it yet, but it is good for what I have seen. No matter what keys she hits, it does something."
3,not bad,"My 23 month old son enjoys pounding on the keyboard. Since this is a key-driven program, it's great for him.However, since they know that small children don't have the dexterity to key very well, they should give the option to disable certain keys, like ""windows,"" alt and Ctrl. This will keep the screen from jumping back and forth between the desktop and the game.Also, I have had issues with the Macromedia Director install that the game requires while running Win XP on both a desktop and laptop.Take it FWIW."
2,Very disappointing,"For my 14 month old duaghter, I purchased this software as well as Reader Rabbit Baby/Toddler and JumpStart Toddler. She lost interest in the Disney software after approximately 5 minutes. It is not as interactive as the others and is not particularly engaging. She's nuts about the Reader Rabbit software and has learned to use both the keyboard and mouse with the Reader Rabbit games."
3,not very pleased,"I purchased this software for my 20 month old - her sister learned to use the mouse with Reader Rabbit playtime for baby so I decided to purchase software made for babies so that my 20 month old could begin to learn how to use the mouse. I was very disappointed to learn that she could only use the keyboard - there should have been an option to use the keyboard or mouse. All in all there are a few activies on the software that she does like; however, I would not recommend this."
2,A Sad Portrayal of Female Friendship,"I'm surprised that so many people have written positively about this book. Cunningham takes on way too much, neglecting major details that could've enriched an otherwise bland, sad story of women in NY. True friends would never neglect sharing the significant details of their lives: a mastectomy, infertility, a parent's impending death. These women focus exclusively on adolescent concerns: their weight and men. How sad for them. This book made me appreciate my friends all the more!"
2,Mediocre and poorly edited,"The constant fixation with the surroundings of each story was mundane, distracting, and, at times, incorrect for a story set in the 21st century. Although the novel is not bad for a quick read, often repeated phrases such as ""mucho dollaros"" and ""cheapo"" are jarring and should have been edited out."
5,five stars for six best friends,"...this could be me, and my five best friends. we are all single, working women in a big city. Finally a book that shows what life can really be like, the actual way it works. More hope than sex, more undercurrents and literary cache. We loved this because it excited and comforted. Laugh out loud but achingly true to accumulated urban truths of our lives. Very sensitive and smart."
5,celestial babes!,"Laura Cunningham writes about women the way we truly are, with all our flaws as glorified as our attributes. Literate and funny Cunningham draws us into complicated lives which reflect our own. Brava!"
1,boring,"Very slow moving, overall not a very interesting story.I was expecting something more chic lit and funny and it wasn't that at all."
5,Beautiful story and characters-- a must read!,"If you read no other book this summer, snatch this one -- Beautiful Bodies is populated with savvy, sexy women who maneuver in today's asphalt jungle. New York has never been depicted better, with its great strengths and weaknesses showing...The women are heartbreaking, yet hilariously fun to be with...The dialogue is outrageous and brilliantly apropos to how we live now. they show different sides of feminity -- the girl who takes care of her mother, the journalist who gets the story, the actress who catches her husband with a lover, and that real estate maven who wants more than her 10 room penthouse. the restaurant spoof is a scream -- Vert where all the food is green."
1,What an unreal waste of time!,"Lucky for me, I borrowed this from the library. how angry would I have been to have wasted money on this! What could have been an AMAZING story, falls flat, dead. ONE character out of the six MAIN characters has a MINIMAL resolution to her issues. The others have NONE. ZERO. One character--one of the more interesting characters in the book--has a big ""secret"" that we wait most of the book for her to reveal... and when she does... YAWN!The character from Kentucky... pul-lease, did this woman do ANY research??? Be serious!Martha, who by all standards, should have had some experience to teach her something valuable... no, she is unchanged.Just a ridiculous waste of my time!"
3,A true Sex and the City novel,"This novel was quite a surprise. I had been disappointed all summer by recommended novels focusing on women that didn't deliver but this one truly did. The characters have surprising depth for a book that chooses to focus on six different individuals. It is very difficult to put this book down as you are driven to find out what each women is hiding yet wishes to reveal. The novel is reminiscent of ""Sex and the City"" but with more depth and genuine feeling. And a little more realistic view of life in the Big Apple."
2,I couldn't even finish this book!,"I rarely stop reading a book after I have started it, especially if I get more than half way through it. I stopped reading this book after I had read more than half of it. The entire first half of the book is just long, drawn out character descriptions and not much plot. I am giving it two stars instead of one for the mere fact that one of the reasons it may have been difficult for me to get into the book was because I would read it too sporadically and in small doses because I was very busy at the time. Cunningham's novel, ""Dreams of Rescue"" is much better."
5,"Great seller, gave me refund for ""postage due"".","This seller offered free shipping, but the package arrived with postage due. They refunded me the amount I had to pay the post office! Great customer service."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,I have yet to receive this order & I have not received a credit. I have filed an A-Z Claim. Still no info. DO NOT buy from this Company!
5,scan disk,Bought as an extra disk for my vacation photos. Did it's job and I didnt have to worry about missing any pictures.
5,It Works Great,The 2GB SanDisk Secure Digital SD Memory Card is the best and the price makes it better
4,Will shop here again,Good Price. Not good Shipping information and tracking. They never let me know it had shipped. I was ready to go to a retail store when it just showed up at the door. No real problems.Received as advertised.
4,Wash Machine Safe,I found out that these are machine washable and will still keep ticking.There is no delicate cycle needed on this product
1,Shipping is PER CARD,This is insane. 6 cards will cost you $35 shipping. Why doesn't Amazon stock these instead of subbing out to these ripoff companies?
1,ChiTek = Customer NO SERVICE,"I ordered a 2GB memory card for a camera, and was kept in the loop on shipping, etc. However, I never got the package. I contacted ChiTek and was told to check with all my neighbors and the Post Office to see if it was mis-delivered. I did all that, no one had seen the package, and since the tracking code shows ""delivered"" (to whom, I do not know, but certainly not to me!), ChiTek says tough luck. Now I have to do a VISA chargeback over a lousy $22.43 order. Lucky it wasn't higher.With ChiTek's lack of concern, I will certainly NEVER buy anything that comes from them again, and I advise each of you to consider this hassle before you do, too."
5,Max memory for my Topographical GPS unit,"2 Gigs is the max memory allowed by my Topographical GPS unit...and it has to be Secure Digital memory.I can place the highest detail level of Topo USA data from 4 states on one of these 2 Gig chips, so I find them very useful AND MUCH less expensive than the XD memory required by my cameras.It would be nice if Olympus and Fuji could also utilize SD memory, but it is probably not fast enough for these cameras that can also take MPEG4 movies as well as rapid fire shots as long as you hold down the shutter button...so I find myself paying 3 to 4 times as much for XD flash memory for my cameras."
5,Perfect for Digital Cameras!,I've never had to delete pictures from my camera to make room for more pictures on this memory card. Perfect amount of storage for a great price!
1,It died,"This card died on me about two months after I bought it. I don't know that I did anything to cause the problem, but I was using it in my motorcycle GPS so this card may not be built to withstand the vibrations and environmental conditions that I exposed it to. I have used other SanDisk cards in the past without problems."
1,Upset,"Whoever sold me this product failed to tell me that I would have problems. When I tried to use it, it said that the card was full but there was nothing on it. I had several people try to fix it and it couldn't be fixed. They told me to ship it back, but I do not have time to get to the post office. This EEk Technology will get no more of my business."
2,Small gripe,"Unfortunately I was never able to load this card to my camera. It had to be returned, and I was charged a restocking fee, for what I feel was nothing I did."
1,"Mis-ordered, returned, no acknowledgement of receipt of goods",The product that was sent was misordered. It should have been the 2 GB SanDisk Micro memory card.Permission was secured to return the card. It was returned in the original package plus an additional envelope. It has now been about three weeks since it was returned via the US Postal Service. The vendor has not acknowledged receipt of the item.
1,Total garbage,"I ordered 3 of these and all 3 of them fail. They cannot be read in any card reader I try, even a SanDisk - and 1 of the cards cannot be used by my camera at all. I purchased another card from another dealer that was not listed as ""bulk"" and it works great - same Blue 2 gb card. I would not recommend these cards."
2,Smoke and mirrors,Seems like a good price for a 2GB memory card. The shipping charge is excessive but that helps Digital Media Source make up the money they discounted on the product.
3,Good Price,"Works good , Havent used much yet . But I will be , Quality Name so shouldnt have a problem with it ."
4,Did it's job,Did what it was supposed to. Arrived on time and as described. 2GB is not very much when you see the 32GB available now. I have had several SanDisk memory cards and have not had a problem with them.
5,Works Perfectly,"I bought this for my Kodak camera. I put it in as soon as it arrived, have been using it for a few weeks, and it hasn't given me any trouble. SanDisk is a name I have grown to trust for SD cards because they have never let me down."
1,media card,"i have a cannon a560,and purchased the sandisk 2.0gb card. the only problem is the card is to slow after each picture you take. you have to wait 3 or 4 seconds before you can take another picture. my 512mb card works alot faster,but you can not take half as many pics. i think the 2.0gb is just to big for this particular camera."
5,"Dirt Cheap, Wii Friendly","Okay, it's not meant to be put in you $1500 SLR camera-needing ultra fast memory. This gets it done cheap and it works in the Wii just fine (apparently a few cards are having issues and more over the 2GB mark)."
3,san disk 2gb,"no problems with the actual product itself, but the shipping cost more than the item itself."
5,Perfect,"This is a perfect memorry card, a lo t of storage and a very good price. One of the best boughts i've done.."
2,Card ok - but doesn't fit amazon suggested electronic mp3 player,I have no problem with the card but purchased a Pyrus 8GB MP3 player and this card was suggested to go along with that item:Pyrus Electronics 8GB MP3 Multi Media Player with Touch Screen and Digital CameraIt does NOT fit the MP3 player slot. So if you are purchasing this combo be aware that the card won't fit.
3,This held up all the pictures that I needed.,This was just the right size for the item that I needed. I have used it in many things and it is still doing a great job. It is worth the cost.
1,First time I ever had problem with Memory Card,"I took about 50 pictures at my daughter's dance recital using this memory card. When I got home and tried to see photos, all I got was an error reading on the card. This was only the second time I had used this card and only had about 40 pictures on it previously. I've never had this happen before with any other memory card. Will never buy SanDisk again!"
4,2 Gig SD memory card,It works well in the SD1000 Cannon camera as intended.For other up loads such as MP3 files it is slow.
3,Shipping charges,"Check the Shipping charge before buying. It's $4.50/item, which makes it more expensive than a Kingston 2GB SD at $12.49 directly from Amazon (when you reach the $25 free shipping situation)."
1,died after a week.,"Not much to say, mine died after a week. I am going to contact san disk to see if they can rma it."
5,"It's a Sandisk, period",No other company comes close to making quality memory cards as Sandisk. They have the highest storage capacity. Kingston and other companies claim 2Gb but you really get only 1.8GB or so due to inadequate sector bifurcation within the memory card. Sandisk has the most efficient and technologically advanced memory cards even though the differences are minor. This basically gives you higher storage capacity and a much longer life. I have never had a Sandisk card that has ever gone bad. Can't buy a better quality product than this.
5,Works well!,"This card works well, just as described. Only 2GB, and have since purchased many more San Disk card with much larger capacaties. You can't lose when you buy San Disk products."
2,got a problem,I used it for my digital camera. However my computer could not read it with in its slot(drive) which can read other SD cards. I have to use a card reader to transfer the content. don't know why is that?
5,review of Sandisk 2.0 gb memory card,"The 2.0GB Sandisk memory card allows me to put many, many pictures of family on my digital photo frame. I can also use it in my digital camera, as well as field cameras."
3,San disk card,I'm happy with it. Works well with all my electronics but is a little slow with my card reader.I would recommend to try the SDHD high performance card
5,Best price and performance by far!,"I felt a tad nervous buying this the price was ""too good to be true"", but it works great!"
2,Beware of shipping costs,If you buy this product be aware that the shipping cost pretty much offsets the great price. I got mine at Circuit City for $14.99. I don't know how they get away charging twelve bucks to ship someting that you could probably ship with a standard envelope and stamp!
1,"""Bulk"" packaging voids warranty","I have not had issues with SanDisk in the past. However, I bought this card and it quit working after 6 months. I would have not minded if it had been replaced, but neither the seller or SanDisk would replace it(yet this listing is claiming a 5 year warranty). The seller would not replace because it was too long after their return period. SanDisk would not replace because their warranty applies to ""Brand New in Factory Sealed Retail packaged products only"". So I am not knocking SanDisk exactly, but the bulk cards. Great price, but if something messes up you're outta luck."
1,Shipping Charges Are Outrageous,"This is a common thing I've found on the internet, especially on Ebay, but more and more on Amazon these days too. I selected several SD memory cards, placed them in my cart. When I went to check out, the total for the cards was about $70. The shipping was more than $85., and the tax was more than $12. The actual shipping charges would be less than $5. I don't know why these people do business this way. At best its dishonest, and at worse, its fraud. For me its a complete turn-off, and I won't do business with these kind of people. I just wish Amazon had a way for me to filter these merchants from my searches so I don't waste so much of my time. As this practice becomes more frequent on Amazon, I find myself using Amazon less. I can see a time in the near future where I'll only use Amazon for book purchases."
1,CRAZY SHIPPING!! Think twice!!,"I put three of these in my cart and the shipping was $18 !!! I live in the US so it was just standard shipping. This is a complete rip off when you think about it. The shipping on these cards is so inexpensive, seller is padding the shipping to make up for the cost. This price was put up to trick people into buying who may not notice the crazy shipping.Do yourself a favor and buy any other cards than these. I will never support price gauging on shipping - its dirty and unfair."
1,Shipping Charges--Outrageous!,The card is fine. I have others and they work greatBUTI ordered two more SD cards and look at the shipping charges from the reseller.Shipping Method: StandardShipping Preference: Group my items into as few shipments as possibleSubtotal of Items: $21.60Shipping & Handling: $13.90------Total for this Order: $35.50I have one-click ordering.Be aware of shipping charges from resellers when comparing prices.
2,Extravegant book and beautiful designs and photography...,"But very few real recipes and lessons, in my opinion, compared to a showcase of great photography. This book was too expensive to be so disengaging. If I had a chance to read it before getting it I would have spent the money elsewhere.I can see what's in this book free online, in one way or another."
4,cakewalk,it looks if it is never used. and i am sure i will use the book for bakingso i will take care of itregards Keo
4,Planning On Building A Masterpiece . . . ?,"Then this book is for you. The author is truly a master at her craft; the cakes pictured are architecturally striking and marvelously beautiful.The book is a large-scale glossy hardbound volume, which might lead one to believe it is filled with pictures of hundreds of different cakes Ms. Braun has baked/built/decorated/bejeweled. Instead, it is a painstaking, precise instruction manual on how to construct a relative few of these matterhorn confections.It's exciting to witness an accomplished chef so willing to share the detailed, step-by-step secrets of her craft. For someone without aspirations of building at least one epic wedding cake, however, this book may disappoint despite the generosity of its author."
5,Fantastic!!,"This is a wonderful book for getting wedding cake ideas or creating your own amazing cake. The recipes are easy to follow and fun to make! A great book, you can't go wrong!"
3,A bit high falutin!,"This is a beautiful book, but i wish there had been more cakes and less talk. Many of the cakes were from past magazines, so I would have liked to have seen more new things. The few instructions there were were not too helpful, to say the least."
4,Beautiful Sugar Art,Margaret Braun's book is so beautiful. She creates such fantastic & over the top cakes that they almost defy gravity. For anybody who loves to bake or aspires to be that kind of an artist this is a must have for your bookshelf.
1,Don't waste your time or money!,Within 10 seconds of opening this book I realized that I should have first looked at it in the bookstore before buying it online.Most of the designs are just aweful looking with a first and second generational web site approach. I was very much looking forward to using Photoshop for advanced interfaces but this is not the book.If you want to create embossed buttons and ugly textures then by all means buy it! For those people actually looking to design an interface keep on looking.
2,Oops...,"Wow, I guess I should have looked at the publish date on this book. 1996! The graphics in the book are almost laughable...they certainly echo the time. I'll probably still look through the book since the basics are probably still the same, but since i'm using CS3, I imagine the bulk of this book will be pointless. I think I only paid a penny for it, though, so I guess I didn't lose much."
1,Pheromones are Phony,Pure Instinct doesn't attract anything or anyone. I get the same attention and acknowledgement regardless of this product. It does have a nice scent that's light and a little sweet smelling. Besides that I suggest you save your money; or buy a different brand.
4,Must-see for LaPaglia fans,"This isn't the most original plot in the world, but it's definitely a sweet and touching tale nonetheless. The beautiful visuals highlight LaPaglia's tender performance of a shy, quiet priest trying to get by during WWII. In particular, this is a showcase of LaPaglia's wonderful array of sad-eyed expressions, puppy-dog guilty looks, and heart-grabbing sighs. If you dig LaPaglia in emotional settings, you will definitely want to see this movie.The other acting is also quite good.The ""Italian"" accents aren't always top-notch and I would have preferred the movie to not have used accents in that way at all, but it's a minor complaint.It was almost six weeks ago that I watched the movie, and I still think about it every day - it moved me that much."
4,extra songs that were a surprise!,"I know, some of you who grew up in Europe or Asian have heard of his songs like Music, Words, Pick up the Phone in the 80s.This compilation includes most of his songs that you loved and has some more remake songs I never heard before in my 80s LP collection of his.So, great buy while it lasts, I don;t think they will print out any more as F R DAVID is not popular nowadays.I am just grateful for Amazon.com putting it on here."
5,PS2 silver console,It is a great value for the money. My four year old loves it. So far so good!!! I recommend it highly for the price.
3,Great Console But...,"This console was in great condition, but all the games that came with it were damaged except for one."
5,Sony Playstation 2 - better bundles elsewhere,"I received my Sony PS2 some weeks ago (in Oct) - good fun! Everything works as advertised. I think that had I not wanted it delivered to me during my vacation, I would have bought it in the town I live in as it appears that there are quite a number of bundled options where PS2s are packaged with starter video games. Although the games aren't the 'marquee' titles, you're likely getting a better value for your money."
4,Good buy but cooling issues,"It's pretty easy to get your money out of this system, the progressive scan functionality is an added plus. So far, it seems like a solid, compact, and sleek build. The reason why i did not give it 4 stars because it does heat up quite a bit after prolonged use, whether it be a game or DVD. I placed a heatsink over mine which helped noticeably."
5,BEST CONSOLE!,"Hey people, i live in Venezuela and i never thought i'd buy a PS2 because it's too expensive here, in my country, so i ordered it from amazon, and oh my God, the best console! Dont care about PS3, or Xbox, buy this console. This has the best games and a lot of them! I just played Kingdom Hearts a few minutes ago and i realized that this PS2 Silver Worthed all the money, and maybe more. Love Amazon, Love PS2. I'm Really Happy!"
5,Great console,"Its a great system, the older version would always give me problems.-. -.and it couldn't read old disks, you know, the black or blue CDs, like the old final fantasy series. Graphics are the same of course, since its a system. I would suggest this to anyone, its conveniant for anyone with a small room, thats badly cluttered. The wires get annoying to continuously push in and out of the rear of the system to turn it off...but otherwise go ahead, buy it. This review is by a 15 3/4 yr old. --the three quarters is very important!!!"
3,A nice book,"This is a nice book for tea party recipes. For anyone who likes to entertain, it can be a big help."
2,Having tea,"Not as good as what I've thought. There are menus with all the recipes, but many of them are not photographed. The table settings & styling look ordinary to me, not very impressive.I would recommend other books like French tea by Carol Manchester and Tea time at the inn by Gail Greco, if anyone is looking for tea books."
3,Average at best,"The photos in this book are lovely, and some of the theme ideas are nice, but honestly, the recipes didn't do much for me, for the most part. If you want some inspiration, and you want some photos for ideas on creating ambience for a nice tea party, then this is a good book; if you're looking for a cookbook, best keep looking."
3,Tasty and informative,I am a tea-lover and always on the lookout for a new book about tea. This book is a wonderful mix of recipes and information about formal and informal tea customs. I enjoyed it very much.
4,A great read,"How does one conduct an analysis of the leading philosophical arguments relating to the the fundamental question of the existence of God, with humour?Somehow Adam Zahorski has done it. He manages to be witty and humerous, without downplaying the depth of the philosophical debate. This was a great read. Enjoy!"
3,Good history,"Great story if you're patient enough to weed through all the stories involving the producers and networks. I was more interested in the ""Not ready for prime time players""."
4,John Belushi was the best comedian to perform on SNL!,"I think that Belushi's character skecthes he did on Saturday Night Live in the seventies. That I remember his impressions on television watching him was Samuari, Joe Cocker, Jake Joilet one of the Blues Brothers and the greek restaurant owner saying CHEESE BURGER! CHEESE BURGER! SORRY NO COKE WE JUST HAVE PEPSI!"
3,Not really what I was expecting,This book has a lot of SNL early history but it tends to be repetitious in much of it's story telling and a long read. I had to keep putting it down and having to come back to it.
4,Backstage look at Saturday Night Live,"Entertaining backstage review of the SNL experience. Best one I've read so far. The corporate politics, the dysfunction, and the wacky insight on some of the guest hosts."
4,Excellent Book Full of Great Stories,"I bought this book without realizing that there is a newer book about SNL, but this was a truly interesting detailed account of what the early days of SNL were like. I was completely entertained and couldn't wait to read the next page and the next story. Full of great tales of drugs, sex and personalities, this book is really interesting and actually inspired me to buy the newer book that was written by different authors so I can hear about the later casts."
4,very insightful and shocking,"This book tells the highs and lows (pun intended) of the first ten years of SNL. Very interesting, it goes through the formation of the original, legendary cast through the horrible sixth season up until '86. A lot of the wounds are still new. Bil Murray was pissed off with Belushi and Aykroyd forleaving him in the lurch to Play ""the white guy"" in every scene. He had heated debates with Lorne and forced his sketches. We see how they underused Eddie Murphy, unforgivable in any circumstance, but just ridiculous when he was working with their worst cast up to that point."
4,"Believeable characterizations, enjoyable read","Not a book that you will want to read again, but an enjoyable few hours."
4,Fun hats for creative play,"My kids, 2 and 4 - enjoy these hats and helmets, the 2 year old in particular loves to wear them around the house. The police helmet in particular is lots of fun. They are great for promoting creative play. They are plastic and kind of cheap looking but fine for dress up fun."
5,the who r u hats,"My grandson loves these hats. Role play is one of his favorites! If he isn't using the fireman's hat for a fireman, then it is as a droid hat from the star wars, clone wars. Aids imagination and creativity. I thought they were a little pricey at first, but they are worth every penny to watch the one playing with them!"
