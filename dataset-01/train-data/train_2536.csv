2,Complexity or Just Hash,"I watched Michael Clayton and was waiting for the ""brilliance"" to illuminate the screen. The press touts its Oscar potential. George Clooney is a riveting actor, but the whole concept of chopping up a story into little pieces and putting it into an ""artistic"" melange is a waste of a what might have been an interesting film. The director must be part of the ""Crash"" school of film making. While this may play well in Hollywood, in a room full of ""ordinary"" viewers this form of film making does not play well. Typical quotes of viewers in my ""circle"":""What is this?"" - 15 minutes into film""Do you know what's going on yet?""- 3/4 of way thru film""This is boring, can we watch something else?""- 15 yr old boy""Let's put this on Amazon right away so we can get the best price""- at end of movieConclusion: Not worth watching again"
2,When did Danny Ocean get so boring?,"When did Danny Ocean get sooo boring. A friend warned me against this movie saying: ""every time George Clooney plays in a comedy it's great, but whenever he plays a serious role, the movie is awful."" While this movie wasn't awful it was very slow moving and uneventful. It plays out like a John Grisham novel that just doesn't make the cut, maybe one that he wrote after a lot of pizza and mexican beer. Didn't hate it, but I'm not going to recommend it."
3,"A film with the right parts, but ends up being too staged","The film does have a strong feel and Clooney gives a solid performance. I found Pollack's lawyer especially sharply drawn and convincing. In the end, the movie becomes another rehashing of The Insider. The screenwriter tried to create the typical conflicted sub-plot of the protagonist's battle with his professional/moral obligations and his personal struggles, etc, however this was not highly nuanced. Of course their was the divorced dad angle too for more contrived emotional push. The one liners that are stirring in the trailers turn out be banal in the context of the plot, which turns into a simple-minded rampage of a corporation hell-bent on eliminating all whistle-blowers. As for the attorney who ""sees the light"", although strongly performed by Wilkinson, his self-revelation becomes cliched scene-by-scene."
3,Clayton is no Bourne,"Don't go into this thinking it is a ""Bourne Identity"" movie and you may get through it. It is more along the lines of ""Broadcast News"" and ""Pelican Brief"" but a fair amount of time is spent showing Michael with his dysfunctional family or doing what he does best, fixing things. Not a bad movie but I had some trouble sitting still when he was with his family. There are definitely some exciting parts, mostly near the end when he is running for his life with information on a dirty large company trying to cover up the truth by killing anyone that has knowledge of their polluting the water. Unfortunately although I enjoyed it I felt like I had seen most of it before. If you enjoy dramas about lawyers you will probably enjoy it. Good quality DVD with fair replayability."
4,Good Thriller,"Not great, but definitely good enough for the $3.99 rental. Enough twists and turns to keep you interested despite being a typical law firm movie (you know, bad attorney with a conscience who ends up doing good)."
4,Pretty Good,"I have to say, I liked the movie. I liked the ending with the horses. Or at least I thought that was the ending.. Though I am partial to horses coming up out of nowhere and staring you in the face for a while in some deserted place (as it once happened to me!).The movie was kind of diffuse and obtuse in the beginning with a flashback story which let it be told in a somewhat off-hand manner, building tension as it goes along, but you have to pay attention (a good movie to watch with the SUBTITLES on). All the same, once it gets going it does keep your attention. The acting and suspense are pretty good with occasional moments of soul - compliments of the horses. A nice touch."
2,Seriously over-rated,"With all the hype about this movie, I was shocked at how disappointing it was. The plot is very far from being original: an evil Monsanto-type company is trying to weasel their way out of liability in a multi-billion lawsuit for knowingly poisioning hundreds of people. (Uh, hello! Ever see ""A Civil Action"" or ""The Constant Gardner"" or any of a hundred other movies?)On top of this, the movie is SLOW. Whoever called this a ""fast-paced thriller"" must either be smoking crack or just be retarded. MC seriously drags.The only saving grace is that Clooney is such a good actor. Without that, this movie would be worthless.Not recommended."
3,The best thing about this film: the ending credits,"At the risk of appearing a smart alec, the thing that most caught my attention about this movie was the credits at the end. Rather than the overused black screen with scrolling names in white, the credits run as Michael Clayton is whisked away through the city after taking down the bad guys.The rest of the movie is mediocre. The same basic story has been told time and time again, with only the faces of the heroes and villains changing. Dying to see a movie about the lid being blown off corporate greed and corruption? Check out The Insider.Clooney's acting is quite good, as usual. Tilda Swinton performed adequately as a villainess, but the screenwriter did her no favors.How this movie got so much Oscar talk, I haven't a clue. It's OK, but nothing more."
1,Don't bother with this piece of garbage,"I heard good things about this movie so I was psyched to see it. I should have known that after 15 minutes with no clue where the movie was going that I was in for a long night. Maybe it will get better, I thought.Nope. It didn't get better, in fact it got much worse, because it was so boring! I was ready to stop the DVD 1 hr in. A lot is going on but there is very little action. I never felt like I was dying to know what happens next, because the entire movie is a collection of random scenes that is attempted to be glued together the last 15 minutes. And you don't really care at that point because the movie has dragged on way too long.When a movie gives you too many puzzles to figure out, which may or may not be related, and you don't really care to follow all these paths, then you know it's going to be bad. George Clooney was average.Anyone who says this is suspenseful, riveting, or thrilling has to be out of their mind.Avoid this movie!"
3,What is this about?,"I'll credit George Clooney for not making mindless movies, for the most part. Here, he's a corporate legal fixer involved in some type of coverup scam involving millions of dollars. It's all a bit unclear, but you get the idea that he's the good guy. A lot of the dialogue seems to be saying something significant, but I couldn't quite figure out what. Some context and explication is missing. You could do worse than this entertainment."
1,A Tired Plot Slower than Molasses in Winter...,"My wife and I watched the first hour of this leisurely ""thriller"" before calling it an evening. Neither of us could jump into the characters, all of whom were too selfish to love and too banal to admire for their rottenness. The plot itself was confusing (and this for a pair of movie lovers who predicted the endings for such films s Sixth Sense and The Prestige) and SLOW in its front and back stories. No doubt the ending saved this film (as well as decent acting and direction), but you'll have to slog through a good hour of excruciatingly sluggish ""build up"" with two-dimensional characters to reach the pay off. We didn't have that kind of patience... ."
1,This movie put me to sleep,The first time I saw this I was asleep after about a half hour. The next day I decided to watch it again to give it a chance since everyone seems to like it. I stayed awake throughout however I found this movie extremely boring and hard to follow.
1,BORING,"Everyone will know the conclusion to this movie in the first 20 minutes and spend the rest of the movie wondering why they made it in the first place. There is no room for great acting with this script, as none of the characters have any depth. Rather, throughout the film, the characters look as if they are inexorably plodding towards the same predictable conclusion and as bored as the viewers are in doing it. This movie sucked."
1,Don't waste 119 minutes on this movie,"The title says it all. With everything I heard about this movie from critical reviews I was expecting something entertaining. What it turned out to be was a slow pace, uncaptivating film drawing out the intricacies of a corporate cover-up. It was hard to relate to the characters and listen to their personal quirks being reiterated and manipulated over a legal battle. The cinematography is good and that's about all."
1,A Very Boring Film,In truth this movie could have told the story in 30 minutes there is really so little to tell!! George Rooney walks through it like he ishalf asleep and the story ( for what it's worth) took so long to unfoldI had trouble staying awake myself. Tilda Swinton should receive an award for over-acting. It was so boring I really did'nt care what happened to the leading characters long before the end! The only actionI remember was the car exploding but there is lots and lots of dialogue.Without Rooney this would have been straight to DVD.
1,Wake me when its over Zzzzzzzzzzz Zzzzzzzzzz....,Zzzzzzzzzz Zzzzzzzzzzz Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz....... Next please.... whoever gives this movie 4-5 stars is obviously getting paid to do so!!!avoid this like swine flu
1,Michael Clayton,"Received this movie,but there are faults in recording. Stops playing and pause. I can't fast forward through"
1,"F... zzzzzzz, f... zzzzzzz, f... zzzzzzz","Bored me to death. The constant use of the ""F"" word didn't help much either. If I could have, I would have walked out on this one within the first 5 minutes."
4,Michael Clayton,I enjoyed the movie and found it to be entertaining. Would recommend it for others to view.
5,Worth your time,"I don't understand the negative reviews here, many of which complain of lack of story or over familiar storyline. This is a character driven film, something our tiny attention span society seems unable to cope with. OK, the premise was not original, but the treatment of it was brilliant. Every character here was being crushed by the weight of a society requiring that they behave against their natural human instincts. The script, the acting, the music and direction all combined to create a crushing, yet entertaining, indictment of what society demands from us if we are to retain its `respect' as dutiful, acquisitive, non-questioning consumers.It was not perfect by any means and the ending was a little neat, but this is Hollywood. At the end I felt a warm glow in the knowledge that there are still hundreds of people `out there' willing and able to collaborate, invest and create an intelligent and worthwhile film. Five stars and congratulations to all concerned."
2,THIS MOTION PICTURE NEEDS MORE MOTION,"There is an uncomfortable numbness to this movie. Dialogue all has the same tone, as do visual elements. TV's Boston Legal does the lawyer-going-crazy bit better; certainly in a more entertaining manner.The plot, really simple in every sense,sloughs on, driven only by flat-inflectedtalk un-accented my Clooney's now too-familarstare.Oh hum; Clooney's got charisma, but his star-power seems stifled here. Just like his for-the-money vehicles Ocean's 12 and 13. Or his political vanity piece Syriana turned out to be."
3,Angst - who needs it?,Too much relationship stuff. Not enough police procedural and plot. Production values good. Acting good. Main problem is the plot is a cliche. There is a question whether the hero will turn out to be good guy or a schmuck.
3,Gripping Thriller?,"Newsweek's review said this was a ""Gripping Thriller"". I didn't find it as gripping or thrilling as the hype. The acting was fine, but I often felt like I saw this film before. Nothing really new here."
3,Busy but interesting.,"Great performance by Clooney, as always. The plot is so convoluted and far fetched that its hard to keep score till nearly the end of the movie.It ultimately makes sense, but be ready to concentrate before you start to watch this movie."
5,"Gripping, Intense, Raw...I watched it twice in the same day!","This movie was a welcome break from the now-common shoot-em-up and high-budget, computerized destruction blockbusters now so popular. I enjoyed the gritty portrayal of life and the raw examination of the human mind seen when Tom Wilkinson's character ""looses"" his. Ethics -vs- Money is a great struggle throughout the movie, as well as our need to escape our ""sickness"" (as Wilkinson's character calls it in the movie) that is everyday life: hence the scene with the horses and the focus on Michael's young boy. This is one to buy, not just rent!"
3,Michael Clayton,"I bought this movie because Clooney got a nomination for best actor for it. I haven't watched it yet, but a lot of people told me it was very boring."
1,Too Sketchy and Pretentious,"I found this movie very boring and pretentious. On one extreme are grossout teenage movies and on the other extreme are the ""intellectual"" movies like this. I rather stay away from both extremes. Storyline was very hard to follow... there were too many side characters... too many distracting/confusing scenes. I still cannot figure out why would a person go out of his way to trespass someone's property to be near 3 ordinary horses? May be this movie was made for movie critices (who must gush over such highbrow movies) and not for general audience."
1,I have Fast-Forward and I know how to use it--- thankfully!,"I have a fast forward (on the tivo) and (thankfully) I know how to use it. My son fell asleep watching it. I almost didn't let him watch it due to the one scene discussiong sexual matters that could have been substituted with something else and kept the movie a PG-13. You've got to wonder if R is a desired rating any more.Like all unbox movies, it can't get 5 stars due to the 1980 stereo sound track! Let's get dolby digital!The movie would have gotten 2, maybe even 3 stars sans Clooney. If amazon's catalog was correct I wouldn't have rented it. This is staring, and produced by George Clooney, yet he was not mentioned on amazon's website. Until Clooney shows respect for his senior, Charlton Heston (look Clooney up in wikipedia's article on Heston) I will continue to boycot his work. Right now, Clooney is not ""politically correct"" in my household."
1,Worst movie I have seen in years.,"These two people who rated this movie 5 star must be speaking of a different movie than the one I viewed with two friends. It was the most boring movie I have ever seen. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen which never did. I still haven't figured out exactily what a ""janitor"" is. As for Clooney's acting I never observed anything that would make it special. If you see this movie I think most of you will agree with me and my friends."
4,Just Say No to John Grisham,"Finally, a legal thriller that doesn't include John Grisham's name in the credits! So, while it's story may not provide much along the lines of originality, I can certainly praise this film for making a number of brilliant stylistic choices. To begin, the script values wit and insight over the type of plot twists that tend to overcomplicate and ruin most thrillers -- the polished monologues that Clooney and Wilkinson deliver are worth the price of admission alone. Not to mention the fact that Clooney and Wilkinson are complete Oscar bait, particularly alongside Swinton and Pollack -- just a steller job of casting all around. Plus, you get to see everything through the lens of Robert Elswit -- what more could you want? Unfortunately, a story with more ambition and originality, but I'll chalk that up to my own greed. (8/10)"
3,Keeps you confused. Is that intentional?,"I watched this movie because my daughter highly recommended it, and she rarely highly recommends anything. I expected to fully enjoy the movie.I thought the acting was good, but am unable to write a synopsis as I still don't quite understand what was happening. I believe it has something to do with an unsafe product, the company that produces it, and a few lawyers of which I can't tell whose side they're on. Anyway, it appears that the good guy wins in the end, which is not obvious because you don't know who the good guy is until the end.I liked George Clooney's performance, but found the movie quite confusing. My husband actually fell asleep because being confused really bores him. I stayed awake and was glad I did in the end, but it takes patience to get there."
3,It's okay.,I was expecting more depth from Clooney and the ending was predictable. I saw what the director and actors were trying to do but I think they came up a bit short in pulling it off.
4,pretty intense,"George Clooney knows how to pick scripts, his character is believable, any violent scenes or obscene language is overlooked as it fits into the story line perfectly"
3,Good Clooney Flick,"I thought this was a pretty good movie. I am a huge George Clooney fan and I enjoyed the movie. But I must say, I didn't think it was as good as the hype. That said it was a compelling movie with great performances. It just wasn't 'great'. Tilda Swinton deserved her Oscar as she was excellent in her role."
4,Michael Clayton,"Michael Clayton is a man with connections. The story is based on a company takeover and some facts the company would like to hide. This story is almost like the movie with Julia Roberts, Erin Brokovich. The movie is filmed in a very special way, which I personally didn't like. George Clooney is an impressive actor but I am afraid that it's not one of his best roles. He was much better in the Ocean's Trilogy or other movies."
4,IRON MAIDEN LIVE!,"This is a decent live album. There are better live releases from this band out there... but if you like Dance Of Death, and want to hear songs from that cd performed live, pick this one up.They left out a lot of good songs in my opinion, and why did they have to include ""Lord of the flies""? That song sucks.Overall a pretty good cd. If your a fan of iron maiden, you'll like it."
2,Horrible editing,"""Steve Harris once again took weeks personally editing the footage and like Rock in Rio this means thousands of cuts right into the heart of the action.""Steve Harris needs to quit making thousands of cuts and let us viewers just watch the show without all of the cuts. Maybe focus on the stage as a whole. It gave me a freakin headache trying to follow the cameras when I tried to watch Rock in Rio. I think it's very, very annoying when the camera will focus on a member of the band, then every 2 seconds the camera moves to someone else. Steve Harris, stop with the damn constant cuts."
2,be careful with upgrades,"I am a long-time photoshop user and fan on both Mac and PC platforms. Recently I bought this upgrade for my Mac (from CS-2)and it rejected my serial numbers: it seems I had the CS-2 suite, and could not upgrade the photoshop segment alone. The reason I had the suite (which I did not want) is that Adobe sent it to me (without my realizing it) when I did a cross-platform upgrade from CS-2 on my PC. Now if I want CS-3 I have to buy it as a stand-alone. Also: be careful with other Adobe products, e.g. Lightroom conflicts with Bridge (at least in CS-2)."
4,They finally listened!,"The first time I launched CS3 I was thrilled to see I could go through the menus and turn off the 75% of things I will never use. CMYK output, dopey filters and so on. What a pleasure to pull down a menu and see exactly what I use and nothing else. I even found myself turning some things on, like soft proofing.Well, this would be enough for five stars. But where is the manual? Adobe manuals have consistently been excellent--and necessary. They are frequently better than the Classroom in a Book, Missing Manual, etc."
5,Must Have,This product is a must have for any serious photographer. The new 'Quick Select' tool is worth the cost of the upgrade. Everything else is just added bonus. If you love photography you must have this upgrade.
3,CANNOT UPGRADE from Creative Suite,You cannot upgrade to Photoshop CS3 from a Creative Suite product. Serial number check will not allow upgrade. I called Adobe customer service to verify. You must purchase stand alone. I wish something on the box had told me that.
1,A Major Headache to Install if you used the BETA!,"It has been two weeks since my Photoshop CS3 arrived, and it still does not install correctly.I had the beta version installed, i uninstalled it following Adobe's guidelines. The results - BIG PROBLEM! The program's install process races through the installation sequence listing all the modules and then declare nothing was installed(?) or will refuse to install declaring a conflict with an installed PS3. I have tried the ""maccs3clean"" script that is available - the result - the Photoshop install program declares it cannot install as a PS3 exists.I have owned Photoshop since version 6, this release is a DISGRACE! Adobe should be ashamed to put this out where installation problems could occur with its own beta version.Yes, I am disgusted! Who will return the lost hours of my life?"
1,not sticky,These are not sticky shapes. They are made out of plain and very thin paper. I am also not happy with the way the shapes are cut out. The most of them look like they are cut with dull scissors and don't have nice and even edges.I am pretty disappointed with the product.
1,Why is there a picture of a rug?,"I'd really be interested in buying a new sensor for my car, but I don't think a rug is going to cut it."
5,Perfectly done!,"Any complaints I'd have regarding these figures are minimal-- the sculpts are very nice, and the little Alien is especially cool-- as are (surprisingly) the little environment bases that come with the figures."
4,can't sit still if you have a pulse when you listen to this,"I had heard this single on my sattelite TV station a few weeks ago, and thought it was really great. So I ordered it, and I love it! There are 7 tracks, all of which have great beats to them. Track 4 is my fav, very cool remix. If you like house/border-line trance, then get this single. It'll knock your socks off."
3,Good singing... bummer about the rest.,"Okay, the song has got really nice vocals, but that's it. The electronic stuff gets quite on the nerves."
3,A good start to a great new series,"Ok the Technis Imperative is a good read. It's not a Grant Morrison story, but it is nevertheless a good read. The dialogues between the Titans and the JLA are great, and really bring out the fact that although both teams exist for the the benfit of the world, the Titans are more of a family type atmosphere. What is also great is that during the big fight scene Batman and Nightwing are having an argument about who is right in the middle of a battle. During the entire story neither throws a punch. You can also see just how much the mentors of the Titans care for their onetime sidekicks, and how grown up those same sidekicks have become. Overall a great story. Definitely worth your time and money."
4,"fantastic art, good story","the art by phil jimenez, evocative of some of george perez's best work, is the highlight of this book. combined with an above average plot and excellent characterization (devin grayson's strong point), this book is a satisfying graphic novel. one of dc comics better selling mini series in 99."
2,DC Super Cheese!,The title alone should give away that this is a pretty goofy book. The plotline is beyond contrived. The actions of the JLAers is ridiculously overzealous. The Titans are whiney. The villain and reveal are unexpected but pretty lame. These are great characters being written by talented people. This could have been so much better. The art by Phil Jimenez is very good though.
2,Choppy & disconnected at best,"This is my first SS book and I have to admit she has potential. BUT this is books is very choppy and at times the transitions from one scene to another is abrupt. I was taken aback many times to realize that it was another scene or time or place, etc. It's almost as if several people wrote different parts of the story and decided to just mash it in together. Ok, so that having been said, the heroine is likable but a bit too horny and desperate. The hero could have been much better if his thoughts weren't so disconnected w/o making any sense. Basically, the book is a major he loves me, he loves me not. If you have nothing to do and can read this for free, go ahead but I wouldnt waste any time or money on it."
2,Not as Represented,"Songs Nos. 3, 6, 9, 12 & 13 are not interpreted by Trio Matamoros. The back print advertises in Spanish ""All songs interpreted by Trio Matamoros"", which is not the case. That's 33% of the disc songs. This is the fourth Trio matamoros CD (out of 7) that I've purchased at Amazon and have several songs interpreted by another group. Dissapointment is growing into frustration. The audio quality is very good."
5,Great Intro for Non-Psychologists,"I am not a psychologist, and was not formally trained in the use of the MMPI-2, but my work brings me in contact with it very frequently. This book served as a perfect introduction to my self-study, and I refer to it frequently in trying to more fully understand the MMPI-2 interpretations provided by psychologists. I have searched for a comparable introductory text, and cannot find one nearly as good."
5,Excellent book,"I had extreme difficulty following all the rules, personalities traits, etc for this personality test. Great book for explanation and knowledge."
5,Worth every penny!,"This work is essential for students learning about the MMPI-2 and established clinicians. The book does an excellent job of interpreting the scales with an emphasis on diversity sensitivity. Further, it allows for easily interpreting the scales which increases the utility and longevity of the book in your clinical library!"
3,A book ...,Tells you what is on the MMPI tests - and how to pass them. Required reading for a college class.
5,Offers an original and enlightening survey,"In Advancing Sisterhood?: Interracial Friendships In Contemporary Southern Fiction, Sharon Monteith offers an original and enlightening survey of how prevalent specific relationships between black and white women in the south have emerged in the novels of Ellen Douglas, Kaye Gibbons, Connie Mae Fowler, Lane von Herzen, Ellen Gilchrist, Carol Dawson, and others. Monteith underscores that interracial friendships have become an accepted topic for white women writers. Highly recommended for students of American literature, race relations, and Southern cultural norms, Advancing Sisterhood? also explores childhood female relationships and considers recent ecocriticism and its role in charting the female southern landscape as depicted in contemporary literature."
1,Not Pleased,"I followed the instructions very carefully and used the rocks that came with the kit. After the allotted time for each package of polish I inspected the stones only to find they didn't look any different. After the final polish tumble I removed the stones, rinsed and dried them. The stones had no shine what so ever. What a waste of time. I am returning unit as of this writing."
4,Interesting Fun,The whole family is waitng to see how the rocks will turn out. Fun to see years of weathering speeded up.
5,Well Worth the Extra Money,I did a lot of research on rock tumblers before I bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas. We are very happy that we invested the extra money to get this model. It is well built and I have a feeling it will last a long time. We put in our first batch of rocks and enjoyed checking in on them over the course of the cycle. We were pleasantly surprised that the rock tumbler was as quiet as it was. My husband grew up with the kind that made a ton of noise. We put this one in the basement on a piece of carpet and while it made a tumbling and grinding noise it wasn't obnoxious. The rocks came out beautifully polished and smooth. We are ready for our second batch. I would recommend this product.
4,Rocks,"Well the fun comes and goes. Its loud, had it in the garage and could hear it throughout the house except the farther bedrooms. It does what it says it will though you won't be in a hurry to use it again."
4,Love the shine!,A blast for me and mt boys! I remember doing this with my dad! This product is durable and works well!
4,Tarot reader & collecter..,"I tend to be skeptical with ""new"" and non-traditional card decks, but I picked this one up because it was gorgeously illustrated. I have since read the book and done readings with the deck, and been pleasantly surprised. The symbolism and representations of the different deities are 90% accurate (important if you want to use this deck!) A beautiful and well-""written"" set, works best doing readings for women."
1,Ooops! Wrong country!,This book has sign language from Britain. Sign language is different in other countries. There's nothing in here to tell you which country. We use American Sign Language.I cannot use it at all and I plan to send it back.
2,NOT AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE,This small book is not in ASL... Was confused when I received it. There are also NO pictures of any signs just a description of what to do.
4,Great occasional pump,"This is the pump they gave me at the hospital when my daughter was born.Pros:It is super easy to put together and clean afterwards.The suction is easy to manipulate with the one handed pump mechanism.I have used it 2-3 times a week for 3+ months without any problems. The original valve continues to work great.You can actually clip on and use bags verses the bottle that comes with it. (although it does take some practice taking them off when full)Cons: A little long to pump one side while feeding from the other. It can be done, just takes a bit of adjusting.Would definitely recommend it for the primarily breast feeding mom that pumps occasionally."
5,A Fable for Our Time,"I have had an interest in the orient for years.I have studiedthe history,philosophy,culture and ways of other peoples.But after reading Grandmaster Dong's book I really know how to relateto all that I learned from him.Using the universal appeal of animals in a story he relates his philosophy and experiences toanybody reading the book.Not just another Kung-fu book,anybodycan understand and relate what is said as the story developes and ends.You won't be able to put this book down until you finish it. Even for those without martial arts experience, you'lllike it!"
5,What an exceptional book,"This book was a pleasure to read. The story was so enlightening I didn't want to stop reading book. Grandmaster Dong did an excellent job in delivering his martial arts philosophies and techniques through a story about a squirrel's triumphs and challenges. This book is excellent for children, beginner students, as well as student parents to learn the benefits of martial arts training in a way that both entertains and enlightens."
5,Life philosophy made simple to read!,"What a joy to find a book that lays out a life philosophy in a story that is both engaging and emminently readable! Whether you are an adult or a youngster, this book helps you understand what it means to live up to a high ethical standard, and how to find ""the way"" of a martial artist to establish that standard.Turns out that to live ""the way"" is not at all what is depicted in movies --- being able to jump high, kick and punch is not the final goal! The real goal is self knowledge, inner peace, gentleness, honor, respect ---- acquired through the physical training of martial arts.Read this book, you will enjoy the story that helps you find ""the way"". Give it to your friends and family, make sure the youngsters read it!!"
3,"Not Bad, Seen better, Seen worse","This is an aerobic workout that will help you crunch calories. The moves are hard to learn the first workout cause they expect you to know the moves already, once you get them down you start breaking sweats and feeling the burn. It took me watching this video 3 times to get the moves down."
1,what were they thinking????,"i bought this tape with the expectation that it would add a little variety to my already extensive workout routine, for those days when i just cannot make it to the gym. i have been working out for over 6 years, and this is the worst fitness tape i have ever bought, and for one big reason -- there is no instruction whatsoever. it is like a dance routine that you are just expected to know, via osmosis or something. buy it for comedic effect, buy it to see how stupid you can look if you really try, but for any other reason? i'd stick to ""saved by the bell"" reruns...at least you can laugh at other people."
5,"If you do AD programming, you need this book!","This book is everything I was hoping it would be. I'm working on a project where I need to get computer accounts from AD (TENS of THOUSANDS of them) and move, delete, enable, disable and set account expiration dates. Everything I need to know is in this book. The AD paged search, useraccount properties, etc. Some of the routines I was able to use as-is (the VB versions from their web site download). These guys do a great job of explaining all the stuff I couldn't find anywhere else. Highly reccomended!"
3,Comments on [...] Deveopers Guide Book,"This is a very good book for[...] developers who wants to program against Active Directory. There are some good examples in this book that can be very handy. Other than examples in pieces, there is not a project or Web Site codes that a beginner could use."
1,My First Golf Book,The binding on the book was broken - pages could easily be pulled from the hard cover. A child's name was written on the back inside cover. I would not characterize this book as being in good shape. Very disappointing.
3,"Wow, I didn't expect this","R.L. Stine writes REALLY GOOD, CREEPY, SPINE-TINGLING stories, but this story was just kinda, well, not even scary a bit. The main thing about this book was a comedy book with certain points to laugh at.It's about a boy named Max Doyle, who is haunted by 2 ghost kids who died. Now Max has to find out a way to save them from an evil ghost named PHEARS. Now Max has also has to save his self.Good Things:1. Good Beginning, makes you intrested2. Good characters, there's the geeky kid, Max Doyle, the two rich kids, Nicky and Tara, and the popular girl, Traci.3. The perspectives of each charactersBad Things:1. The ghost, there's not even scary. There's goofy2. Max Doyles magic stinksThis book is good to read. Read it, and you might enjoy."
5,Blues that will make you happy,"There's never a dull moment with Johnny Bassett. His repertoire is at once old school, risquee and delightful. Johnny's voice is surprisingly good for a man who has probably spent much of his life in smoky bars. When he sings, I hear a bright blend of Leon Thomas and Mac Rebennack. He's a master at guitar improvisations and can steer himself expertly out of any ditch. This is a fun, feel-good CD."
4,Soooo soft,"I gave this product 4 stars because we cannot live without it. Based on quality it may deserve a 3. I'm buying my third because it is my sons favorite. It is sooo soft and the stripes make it appropriate for boys and girls. They have improved the quality - the first one we received as a gift is being worn thin from washing and has a hole but still does the job. The second is holding up much better but I see the begining of a hole - i feel that it is just a function of it being chenille. Both blankets are washed at least weekly and get a lot of abuse as my son is somewhat of a ""Lynus"" and carries them everywhere!"
5,Wonderfully soft! Another great Wamsutta product!,"I'm so glad I registered for this blanket! It's so soft! It's lightweight enough to use in summer. The colors are great for a boy or a girl. In my experience, you can't go wrong with anything made by Wamsutta!"
2,Other Bear Books better.,"It seems that this particular ""Bear on a Bike"" was written before the others, like ""Bear at Home"", which is very very good.I would skip this one: the rhyming text isn't that fun to read and the illustrations aren't nearly as good as the later books."
5,favorite books,"highly recommend this book. very colorful, has good rhyme. there is so much going on in each picture, really keeps the child engaged. the best one of the bear book series."
3,Illustrations Outshine Text,"Debbie Harter's illustrations are the real reason pages get turned in our copy of Bear on a Bike, as the bear rides a bike, a raft, a train, a boat, a carriage and (did I miss anything?) eventually a rocketship to the market, the forest, the seaside, an island, a castle, and ""out of sight"". Stella Blackstone's sing-song rhyme gets caught up a couple of times, such as when the bear is ""going to a castle/where night is turned to day/where princes and princesses dance/and merry music plays"". The clumsiness of the rhyme started annoying me after about the twentieth reading. I have to say, though, it doesn't bother my toddler, who chooses this book over and over again."
1,Bear on a Bike,This was an interesting book for pre-school age children. My little grandson is two and he likes to read it over and over agaIN.
5,EXCELLENT book!!,"This is my daughter's all time favorite book, she has loved it since she was a baby, she is now almost 3 and still loves it. My son is 1 1/2 and it is his favorite too! They each pick this book every night and fight over who sits on my lap to read it. It's a cute story with rhymes and my kids learned a lot from it, especially the grocery page."
2,Just for collectors,"They don't add any meat here unfortunately, ""Lead the Blind"" is OK, but the cover is embarrasing. That's a shame, a single should be a place to stretch out and try some new things, not just a technique to sell more CD's to fans. OK, this one has a picture of Jim, and the other one has a picture of Charlie, so . . ."
3,Decent sound.... IF you have a sub.,"I was pretty dissapointed with these when I first installed them. They cannot handle the lower frequencies therefore they fuzz all the time at medium to high volumes. However, I just got a sub and am now running a high-pass filter on these. They sound great now! Don't get these if you aren't running a high-pass filter on them."
5,Developer,"This is an excellent overview -- and quite a bit more -- for .NET (which itself is not a 5 star thing.)If it were literature it would get only 2 stars. And if it were the same topic and 800 pages I'd give it 3. But in comparison to the blank or pompous mountains of sludge that pass for technical writing (thinking) in computing, ..."
2,Major Inacuracies,"This book was written during the VS.NET beta 2 timeframe, and there are several major inaccuracies and some outdated content. This book was a disappointment."
5,Great songs to sign with the kids,I have lots of classical piano music but needed songs I could sing with my kids. This collection has all the favorites and the arrangements are easy enough to play and sing at the same time.
2,Worst paint job ever,"The two-headed dragon figure stands 6"" tall with base. The assembling process was painstaking because one of the wings' sockets doesn't fit with its bolt. I had to twist it real hard to snap it in place. Since these things are meant to be displayed and not played with, they have some sharp edges. So, be careful.As one of many McFarlane dragons I own, the paint job on this one is the worst. The icy silver paint on the dragon's wings and its belly is nonexistent. Its skin does not look ice blue as pictured on Amazon but is navy blue instead. Also, the tail is painted all heather gray, which makes the dragon looks half way gray, half way blue. Yuck!On top of that, the base is too small and too lightweight for the figure, so it wobbles."
1,I'll Remember You,"I have a huge collection of Nana Mouskouri music; probably just about everything she has recorded, but I must say this is the worst recording of hers I have ever heard. For all the new songs she recorded on this album, she could not find her key and constantly sang out of tune or completely divorced from the melody. Her voice started going downhill around the time she did the PBS recording at St. John the Divine Cathedral in New York. That should have been a warning not to buy her new CDs but to remember the wonderful voice she once had. I am embarrased for her that she would release such a horror as this. Save your money folks!"
1,Nana's latest album,"In my opinion,this is not on a level with Nana Mouskouri's previous albums. The quality of her voice,and her delivery is not satisfactory."
5,Nana Remembers Love,"Nana Mouskouri can sing anything! She's just a wonderful singer. The songs on this album are songs of love - love gone, love lost, somewhat sentimental. Having recently lost my wonderful husband, these songs just touch my heart: Who Knows Where the Time Goes, For all we Know, Autumn Leaves. Some of these songs are all new to me, but I've almost memorized them. There are two or three that don't seem to fit the theme, but still beautiful songs. There's nothing wrong with sentimentality - we need more of it.I may have to order a back-up of this CD because I'm afraid I'll wear it out! I love this album - I really connect to the music."
5,Mystical San Francisco,"Beautiful photos, insightful, clever commentary. A must have for any larger Bay area resident or wonderful gift or take home purchase for the area visitor."
4,Lowest priced quality made Pocket trumpet,I am a professional trumpet player I own this pocket trumpet and recommend it for anyone on a budget.If you are considering buying a pocket trumpet trust me: DO NOT BUY A LOWER PRICED POCKET TRUMPET!This trumpet is quality made in the Czech Republic with stainless steel valves & my only complaint is it should have a 2nd water key (Spit valve). They have a good warranty program but you probably will never need to use it.I also really like the Jupiter Pocket trumpet which I own but it is more money. Pocket trumpets are a gimmick for advanced players. A normal Bb trumpet is recommended for a beginner.
2,"Mediocre, misses a lot, hardly Ultimate","No denying Denny Laine is great (and his best work is outside of his long tenure in Wings), but this collection is hardly ""ultimate"". It misses the Denny & Diplomats demo, the other Deram solo single (Catherine's Wheel), the great Air Force single (""Man of Constant Sorrow""), the Balls single. Get the hard to find cd ""Memory Laine"", which has most of those.The French have a word for this: ""Boff""......"
4,informative,"comprehensive guide to construction of, and maintainance of a small compact room for the cultivation, and care of an indoor greenhouse."
4,Benificial!!!,If you are like me reading a book about anything it is kinda hard to picture what is being talked about. This dvd is perfect for anyone looking for information on this topic.
2,OK But Not Great,"This DVD is ok for beginners, but does not go into great detail about anything. Also, it seems somewhat unorganized and disjointed. It would be very simple to make a much more organized and detailed DVD, and such DVD's SHOULD be available. You can learn much more about growing marijuana for FREE by just watching many of the growers who offer information on YouTube. Their videos are much more up to date, and offer more detail than this video. It takes a little time to find them all, but they offer free advice and very up to date growing methods. There is quite the ""growing"" community on YouTube, and many of the more experienced growers offer great videos and advice, and all for free. They are much better than this High Times video. If you are a total novice, this video is ok as a start, but it is lacking in detail and organization. A REAL grower's guide would require two DVD's of two or more hours detailed instruction each."
2,Playaway technology a big disappointment,"This audiobook comes on a small battery powered playback device supplied with earphones which is called a ""PLAYAWAY"". The biggest disappointment was the audio quality; it sounds like listening to someone reading a book to you over an average to poor telephone connection. Perhaps I am spoiled by the high quality CD discs I expect when ordering an Audiobook today, but even the cassette tapes of yesterday had superior audio quality to the ""PLAYAWAY"" of today.The poor audio quality distracts severely from my enjoyment from an otherwise fascinating book - the world of audio technology is not yet flat!"
3,Interesting but a bit long and dry for the car,I bought this for my wife to listen to in the car. She found it interesting but bit long and dry for the car. Perhaps we just need a long road trip through some desolate flat country like South Dakota or Nebraska to get through it....
3,OK nothing outstanding,"The book is not bad but I found it too basic and simplistic. Its a good read if you are just awakening to the fact that your world is affected by something called globalisation. Examples are good but the concepts are repeated again , and again and again... we got you Mr Friedman for the first time,So overall the book is kinda of lukewarm.."
3,How to pack a 10 page paper into a 300 page book,"Some very good insights and ideas, but Tom Friedman loves to hear himself talk in the most self-congulatory fashion and uses 25 words when 3 would suffice."
4,"Great Info, annoying reader","I am really enjoying this book but 2 things if you are going to listen to this:1) The reader hardly ever uses contractions so you feel like he thinks you're an idiot.2) He does extremely annoying interpretations of foriegn accents. Terrible. He speaks slow, mimics only some parts of the accents and puts out way too much enunciation. If I had time to read the book I would, but I don't so I'm listening to this and I'm wishing it were over, dsespite how excellent the material is and great the format of the book is. Just make sure you to a sample before you buy it!!!"
3,"Great Audio Book, but ...","This Audio CD collection is great value! It is quite entertaining to hear someone read the book aloud. I drove nearly 200 miles listening to (3 of ) the CDs without getting tired of the driving!However, I'd recommend that, in audio books in general, the narrator pronounce the foreign language proper names in the manner in which they are pronounced by a native speaker. I am [now a U. S. citizen and] originally from Bangalore, Karnataka, and I found listening to the pronunciation of ""Karnataka"", ""Rao"" and several other words, at once amusing and somewhat difficult to comprehend at the first listen."
5,"Great book, good narrater too.","This book shows me the ""very big deals"" in a nutshell. I love it. The audio performance is not bad either."
4,To the point and beautifully Illustrated,"This the one book that taught me more about how to use my SLR than the camera's manual itself. The step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography. I also liked the way Mr. Frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter. One take without the filter and then the same one with a filter. Also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field. An encompassing book, the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment. The peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown. A good buy and money well spent. My only gripe is that I preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag."
5,Great Book for Both SLR and Digital Cameras,"I just received the book today and am amazed at how much USEFUL information is in this book. Having both SLR and digital cameras, this is the book that I've been looking for. The illustrations are simple, precise and very easy to follow. It's not written specifically for professional photographers, but for amateurs like me who just want to better understand my cameras."
1,I still have not received this item!,I placed the order for this vacuum back in November 2006 and still have not received it.
4,"Great Music, but Live Radio Transcription","Rating would be a five, but this is a collection of radio performances with a live audience. If you're looking for great cowboy music, this is your CD. However if introductions and applause aren't your thing, this CD will not please you."
1,Disappointed,"This book is really awful. Its more like a teen mag quiz. With really cheesy answers to choose from. It doesn't give much to elaborate on with your lover. More like ask a question choose answer, move on no room to really discuss or elaborate on the answers. I thought this was a really poorly written book. Not what I expected at all."
2,I am sorry,"I think this is the lowest star review I have ever given. The concept is good, providing questions to help you get to know each other but the overall questions are cheesy and sophmoric and really wouldnt help any relationship besides making small talk. The answer part was just plain silly.If it is deep, meaningful questions you are looking for I would recommend 1000 Questions for Couples instead."
1,Worthless,As a Fiat afficiando I am always excited when a book comes out since there are far less published works than with many other makes of cars. Basically a picture book with limited text and information I also couldn't figure out if there was any logic as to how the book was formatted. For example not unitl halfway into the book was there any biographical information about Carlo Abarth and that was just three paragraphs.Extremely disappointing. Save your 15 dollars.
1,Remote Dullness,"I was hoping for an expansion of Morehouse's earlier book 'Psychic Warrior.'I was sorely disappointed.Even, 'The Men Who Stare At Goats' held my interest longer.Morehouse seems to be giving a textbook class in RV.Good for him.But why did I think that I was buying a history of the program?Well, caveat emptor, sucka!Please avoid this book, unless you are a new ager into high-end bafflegabor if you are not averse to having your soul stolen/usurped.Dave, go back to basics and give all of us a complete history of RV.We are still waiting.Until then, I would encourage all Amazon readers to purchase used copiesof the amazingly well-researched book 'The Stargate Conspiracy' by LynnPicknett and Clive Prince. You will find reams of data on all of the dramatispersonae of the aforementioned (dare I say) cults....."
1,Not worth the time.,"Given the author's reputation, this is a disappointing read. First of all, it is a 399 page book, you have to have time to dissolve and digest author's meanings and theories. And come to the end, I feel I have learned nothing from it. All information can be easily accessed just by reading the Internet. Those info are basic, it needs to have knots and bolts methods in it, with this book... is a ""no""."
3,You Need a Purpose,"I actually enjoyed the meditation disk that came with the book more than the book itself. Though informative, unless you have a need for RV, it's more about how it's done. But it's not easy without help."
3,Remote Viewing: The Complete User's Manual for Coordinate Remote Viewing,"This is a teaser audio DVD for a 22 cd couse. It is mostlt basic not the ""Complete User's Manual for Coordinate Remote Viewing"" I found the information helpful and the pace good."
5,Your Friendly Neighborhood Playa Partna Is Bacc!!!,"If you are a true West Coast ridah this is a must have! it has all the elements of a true classic, tight beats, tight rhymes, and that unique style only Suga Free can bring, some of the best cutz on the album are songs like; Thinkin (produced by Quik), Get Loose (produced by Saccs), Pay Me (produced by Saccs), and last but not least a highly unusual, yet still bangin' tracc feat. Chingy???- Circus Music (produced by Quik.) This is a must have, a cd you can just put in and listen to, the whole way through! the West is Bacc!!!"
4,He's Back,"For all of you who are true Suge Free fans, this CD is the bomb. He's still keepin it P to the I and he got Chingy featuring on one of his cuts. This is a must get CD."
1,crap,Blew shortly in 1 hr not made well wish I didn't waste my money ......Fyi blew off 300 rms with 2 of these connected :/ in a sealed box
2,"Cheap, but worth it","The Lanzar MAX8 came early and i was excited to try it. I unboxed it, had already built a sealed enclosure, and sealed it in to dry over night. I was playing about half volume if not less and it sounds good, very deep, hitting solid, keeping fast notes crisp. But after about an hour of playing at xmax, the cheap leads connecting to the sub were damaged. They go directly into the cone(beats me why they would have such a cheap design when everyone in the industry knows better) and vibrate extremely causing them to essentially break of from the coil. At that point the more power you gave it the more it would make popping and smacking noises from the leads. Its rated 250W RMS and it barely had 150 going through it. You take your chance with this sub but it did sound great while it lasted. I would recommend a ported enclosure for it so as not to put to much pressure on the motor assembly and reduce excursion.Currently a Kicker fan!!"
5,Great Little Subs,"If you are low on space and just want more bass in your ride then this is a good option. I had two of these in a sealed box and were powered by a 750 watt amp and they hit pretty good for 8 inch subs. So these are a good buy, no worries about these.Good luck"
5,great woofers,"had these for a few years now and still going strong,they put out much more bass than you pay for."
4,for the price can't be beat,"So dont expect Rockford Fosgate sound out of this, but expect to be suprised. This little subwoofer packs a punch. I have it hooked to a T.M.A 250.1 and bridged it so im only giving it 500 watts and i was impressed by the quality of sound and responsiveness of this dirt cheap subwoofer.This is installed in my 05 F-150 single cab mounted in the center console. When the base hits you can feel it spread out through the entire cab. The longest i have had it running continuously is about 1.5 hours (it never bottomed out or showed any issues)This is a great addition to anyones sound system that needs good mid bass. For the price, i doubt you will find a better subwoofer."
4,Very Good - for the money & size,"I have put this behind the back seat of my N16 Nissan Pulsar in a 10 litre sealed box & driven by 125 watts RMS. It sounds every bit as good as I had hoped from an 8"". It does struggle with the low lows but it wasn't built for that. Bonus is I still have a boot & the tight punchy bass of the majority of songs sounds fantastic."
4,"It's alright for a cheap little 8"".","This sub isn't going to blow your ears out but for the price it surely isn't bad. It won't win you any SPL competitions but it gets loud enough for what it is. I have it powered with 200wrms in a .4 cu/ft sealed box right now and it sounds like you would expect for a single 8"". I would suggest one if you're just looking to add a little bass to your system on the cheap but not for anyone looking for big heart pounding bass."
3,It's ok,"I bought this for my ferrets because I liked the idea of having an odor eater in their bed. However, the bed was much smaller than I thought it would be. It definitely cannot fit more than one ferret at a time and it did not fit our fat ferret at all. When we first got it, our ferrets fought over it. Then when we put it in their cage, they dug at the zipper part on the inside (where the odor eater goes) and tore it open.If you want a bed that will make your ferrets happy, just go out to petco or walmart and get a small cat bed for like $8 that will fit more than one ferret comfortably and you won't be upset if they destroy it."
2,Dissapointing...,"Readers should be aware that only volume 2 is available, focusing mostly on apache campaigns and post-indian war. Those interested in prior campaigns (civil war, sioux war of 1876-77) will therefore be frustrated..."
5,Deer Woman,"Bought this for one reason and one reason only. The ""Deer Woman"" episode, filmed around Vancouver, BC has Cinthia Moura in it. Every man's dream; every woman's nightmare!"
1,Does not contain bleach!,"I was excited to see that Amazon.com offered Gain Powder Detergent with Bleach - so I purchased my first order in April 2006. I noticed that the first box did not contain bleach, although the packaging clearly stated it did. I eventually found out the remaining 2 boxes did not contain bleach as well. I took another chance in June 2006 - same problem. This last order I returned to Amazon.com for a refund."
3,Run of the mill.,Typical of the genre and nothing new with regards to technology and honestly the story is old news. Nothing in the way of a wow either although Tamara Feldman is nice to watch and is top notch in the fight scene. A nice car chase too. It seemed the actors had difficulty with the script but Ving Rhames almost hits his stride. Big names Jonathan Pryce and Martin Sheen have minor roles and aren't especially believable and neither Burns or West are able to cause any excitement. Perhaps a better script would've helped. I wouldn't buy but not bad for a rental.
3,Good plot,The last min of movie does not play other then that the movie was good. But I dont see myself adding this to my home collection ever.
3,"""Afternoon Special"" version of Eagle-Eye or Enemy of the State","This was not as awful as some folks are saying. Yes it's cliche, and you've probably seen it all before.That being said, I actually liked it better than Eagle-Eye or Wanted. This is a familiar ""big brother"" plot - the computer Echelon begins to exert some control, and nobody knows how or to what end.The movie actually reminded me quite a bit of an X-Files episode several years ago, Kill Switch, in which a government-controlled satellite was tracking people, and ultimately killed them with a laser.There are some small roles by Ving Rhames, Jonathan Pryce, & Martin Sheen. And though it's not exactly edge-of-your-seat, there are a couple neat car chases, and the soundtrack & music editing is actually pretty decent.For a smaller-budged movie, by an up-and-comer director, it was certainly above average. So if you like conspiracy movies, if you're an X-Files fan, etc., I suspect you may enjoy it."
3,Not as good as I hoped for,"I had Echelon conspiracy or Push to choose from at the video rental store so I opted for this one. I remember Shane West in A Walk to Remember and loved him in it, so I wanted to give him a shot with this movie. The concept behind the movie is pretty cool. A super cell phone shows up and gives you tips on making quick money. However, the storyline dips into unbelievable pretty quickly and the acting is subpar. My husband and I laughed at the non-subtle hints of comparisons to our past administrations actions. You'll notice the blatant picture of President Bush in several scenes. A movie to watch if you don't have a good option at the rental store but I'd skip purchasing it."
4,Entertaining.,"I really enjoyed this movie. It reminded me of War Games with a sprinkling of other action packed good guy/bad guy/bad guy with a conscience movies--you get the picture, and a Nikita like heroine, And, hey, what's not to like about Shane West?"
4,Excellent Buy Excellent Story,I choose this movie because the storyline was intriguing. I purchased it when the price offer was less than $4. It turn out to be more than worth the purchase price.
2,2nd the unbelievable plot review,"This whole movie just played SO lame....the actions the lead character takes...following commands from a phone, given to him by a computer with a mind of it's own. Just poorly exectuted from A to Z. Acting, scripting, screenplay, writing....It felt like 'b movie' quality all around. Guess that's why I'd never heard of it, 'til it went into Netflix pool of 'streamed to your tv' flicks, which are mostly clunkers, by and large!"
3,"Tragic story, horrible translation","First of all, I don't doubt one word of this woman's story. The ability for people to persevere during war is truly remarkable, and Rosa's story is no different. The Japanese enslavement of comfort women is well documented.However, the translation and Kindle edition is very difficult to read. Random sentences and non-paragraphs appear out of nowhere. Also, parts of the beginning of the book seem almost like they are out of chronological order. It's a shame that the book couldn't have been translated and written to better honor Rosa's story. I am unhappy to have spent the money on a book so poorly laid out. I would have rather got it at the library."
4,Pharaoh's Daughter,I thought the Pharaoh's Daughter was a good young adult book. It's a good book to learn more about how the Egyptians lived and what gods they worshiped. My favortie scene is when the Pharaoh comes and talks to Almah at the end of the book. It was cool to see how happy both the Pharaoh and Almah were when the Pharaoh told Almah Mosis was alive. I would recommend this book for high school boys and girls.
1,A Disappointment,"Julius Lester has proven to be a disappointment. Moses (Moshe) was of African origins and so I would assume his sister was also. To portray her as a European is a total lie. Ancient Egyptians and Hebrews were of African origins, a fact that many people have a problem gasping. To deny this fact is to insult African people. Further, the Hebrew religion is not defined and limited to one's race. There are Hebrews around the world representing various ethnic groups. Judaism is not a white religion, nor are its origins."
4,A Summary on Pharaoh's Daughter a stoy of Ancient Egypt,"When I first started to read this book I thought it would be more historical. It did give you some information but it also had a story plot to it which made the story so much more interesting to me. Almah, the main person, was a well developed person who loves adventure. Almah has a baby brother who eventually is called Mosis. Much of the ook was deciding wheter or not he wanted to stay with the Haribu, his people, or the people in the palace his adapative family. In the end Mosis makes his decision. I think that the book was well written and very informative. I think that most kids, teachers, and parents would like this book. I liked a lot on a scale 1-10 10 being the highest a would give it a 9.5. Pharaoh's Daughter was extemerly interesting I think everyone should read."
4,Pharoah's Daughter Book Review,"I liked how the characters Almah, Meryetamun, Ramesses and Asetnefret are portrayed. I like the feelings the author gives Almah and Mosis while you are reading from there point of view. I thought the book was very interesting and easy to read. I thought Epilogue was good because you find out what Ramesses was really thinking about Mosis."
5,A good read,"I really love this book - both from a history point of view and from a dratmatic point of view.I first read this book when I was in middle school and I really liked it a lot. I thought it was a great book - it taught about another culture/religion/way of life, while also keeping an adequate amount of character drama in the book to keep my attention.I have read complaints about the nudity in other reviews, but it is not like anyone is having sex - the book simply states that the religious dances are done in the nude, which is a fact, not a fantasy. I do not feel this book is anappropriate for the age group it was written for. I was fascinated by the story, and have recently reread it and I still think that it is an interesting read.It teaches you about finding your own path while not forgetting where you came from, and how to find the strength to be your own person."
4,Pharaoh's Daughter,This was a good book. I liked how it was easy to read and that it was not very long. I would suggest this book to anyone who likes to learn about ancient Egypt.
5,I loved It!,"I really liked this book, I would recomend it to teenagers. It really tells how teenagers might be thinking at that time. If you like Moses it tells you what he might be thinking. It tells about the life of the rich and of the poor. I recomend that you read this book."
4,Sean's view of the Pharaoh's Daughter,"I read the book Pharaoh's Daughter, and I thought it was an overall good book. It was interesting to see Ancient Egypt through the eyes of Moses (spelled Mosis in the book) and his sister, Almah. It was filled with action and suspense.In the story, Egyptian soldiers decided to take away every baby Hebrew boy, including Almah's younger brother Yekutiel, and feed them to the alligators. Almah wouldn't take this, though. When the soldiers came to their house, she and her family took off and hid Yekutiel. When Almah tried to find a hiding place, she met an Egyptian Princess that took her and her family into her arms.The book was very interesting in that the author, Julius Lester, shows half of the book from the perspective of Almah, and the other half from Mosis's. It shows the part of Mosis's life that nobody hears about and reminds you that even great people like himself are just human and make mistakes.."
1,References to nudity in this book,"As an Adult, I didn't like this book at all. It seemed too mature for the ages suggested of 12 and up. There were numerous references to nudity in this book and at the end of the book there was more nudity but there was no warning in the jacket cover regarding this. It was mentioned by the author after the story, not in prelude. At the end of this book, it does not say anything about her brother and her family. This book will hurt women and girls a lot. Out of all the books that I had read, this is the worse one that I have read. This book made me sick to my stomach after I read it. Do not waster your money on getting this book and do not waster your time reading it. It is not worth it at all. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone at all."
2,A low point in an otherwise good series.,"The Black Company is probably my favorite fantasy series of all that I have read, but this particular volume is probably the rock-bottom lowest point that it reaches. There are some memorable moments, but the real meaty content of the book could have been condensed into a volume half its size.It builds on goals and plot points set up in Bleak Seasons, but much of it consists of Murgen wandering the spirit world about as aimlessly as the book itself, and the Company making precious little advance towards said goals. Things slow to a halt after the first quarter or so, and stay there until the very end, when events rush forward to the conclusion, almost as a last-minute setup for Water Sleeps, the following book.Two stars because I wanted so much more from a Black Company book, but compared to other fantasy ""literature"" out there, this is a superior book with pacing problems."
5,This series should be bigger than the Wheel Of Time!,"Of course I haven't read this yet, since it hasn't been released...but I'd like to say some things about the series. (And I'm sure this book will be as good as the rest were).An excellent read, though it might be confusing if you haven't read the rest of the Black Company series. No all-powerful characters. Characters you can relate to on some level. This isn't some flowery fantasy ala Eddings. It can be brutal. There is no definite line between Good and Evil...just like in our reality. An excellent series...get them all: The Black Company / Shadows Linger / The White Rose / The Silver Spike / Shadow Games / Dreams Of Steel / Bleak Seasons / She Is The Darkness (to be released Fall 1997)"
5,The Black Company Rules.,"Yet another doozy for the Black Company. I hate reviews that discuss the plot or give a synopsis, so I won't do that. You can find enough here. This review is merely to tell anyone doubting that though this is the EIGHTH book in the series, it is still as fantastic as the first one. Rare in any series.Murgen is the narrator in this one, and is still hopping around time and place while passed out. If you don't know what I am talking about, you need to read the first seven books before even worrying about this one. The Company is still heading to Khatovar, and Soulcatcher is still being a pain. I suppose that I am discussing plot now, violating my rule, but what the heck.Long story short, Cook manages to maintain a gritty, funny, enticing and absorbing tale after 30 years of Company and thousands of pages. Bravo."
5,An excellent adition to the series.,"As a long-time Black Company (and Glen Cook in general) fan, I must confess I was a bit disappointed by Bleak Seasons. Which is why ""She Is the Darkness"" was such a wonderful surprise.If you're a Black Company fan, you'll love this book. If you're not, I envy you -- you get to discover the whole series for the first time.All in all, it's one of the best fantasy series ever written. In a world full of Richard Jordan's sort of under-edited, overwritten pap, it's a very welcome change."
4,Pretty good read.,"Having followed the annals of the Black Company since they first started marching, I can claim to be an avid fan. I have read the Annals of the north 5 or 6 times and have yet to tire of them. This book is finally seeing the 400 year hiatus of the company end as they are returning to thier origins. In some ways this book just didn't live up with rest of the series, nor did the last one for that matter, but its easy to see why, after all how do you top the other books. All in all a good read though."
4,Worthy,"Dr Nuland takes us on an exciting and inspirational tour through the annals of medicine. Beautifully written. However hard he tries though, he can't keep a muzzle on his surgeon's hauteur - it shines through the work."
2,A personal opinion,"It's sad to say that this is a more a novel than a biography ,far from a history.Basically ,it stressed too much on the history of surgery, and westernized medicine oriented ,over-pessimistic in the ""triumph"" of of the modern medicine.However ,this book presents terrific narratives,just like the style of Dr. Nuland!"
4,A required reading for any medical student.,"Dr. Nuland gives us a riveting review of the triumphs and mistakes, the successes and failures, and the brilliance and blunders of the giants on whose shoulders we stand now and who have taken us to our present understanding of the art of healing. Anyone interested in pursuing a career in medicine should read this book."
3,Less useful than others,"THis big dictionary is the perpetual 2nd choice in our household: it is clumsy to find the right word, somewhat out of date, and poorly covers slang. So we only use it when we know we must wander in it in frustration.Tepidly recommended. Oxford dictionaries are far better."
2,Misleading Description,"Be aware that this book was written for the instructor/student. If you are a freelance writer (as mentioned in the description) IT WILL NOT HELP YOU. If you are a professional writer looking for ways to enhance your presentation portfolio, keep looking. If you are a teacher looking for ways to teach your students better writing habits, you might want to take a look."
4,"A slow starter, but good otherwise","The first few pages aren't very exciting, but once the main plot settles in, you'll want to keep reading to see what happens next. This is the first Janette Oke book for adults that takes place in modern times (The 2 children's books by Janette Oke which I've purchased take place in modern times), and while the reviewer at ""Publisher's Weekly"" did not enjoy it, I would be willing to read it again. I had a brother who died of muscular distrophy when he was 17, and taking care of my 10-year-old son who also suffers from the same disease has not been easy. Sometimes I reach the end of my rope just as Dana's mother did, so I applaud the realistic writing style - things like this really happen to good people."
5,A Tear Jerker.....,"This was a wonderful book. It does start out a tad slow, but believe me, once you get started, you won't want to put it down!! By the time you get to the end of the book your heart will be in your throat. It was very well written and I would highly recomend it to anyone and everyone."
5,"One of the saddest, most beautiful books ever","This book is worth the time. When I first started into it, I thought it was boring. But by the time I had reached the second chapter, I was pretty sure that I would enjoy the book. I ended up staying up past midnight to finish it! I would highly recommend it to anyone. If you like a tear-jerker, this is it. I have never cried so much through a single book in my whole life."
4,"Solid case, looks good, runs cool","I've had the Overture II case for about a year now. I'm running 2 hard drives and 1 optical drive and the case disperses heat very well. I agree with the previous reviewer that it is not suited for 4 hard drives and with a high performance video processor.It's nice to have the case off the floor, it looks great on a desktop and accumulates a fraction of the dust my old tower case did. The case is well ventilated with a minimum of fan noise.It's a well designed case and component installation was easy. When I build my next PC I will probably buy another."
4,Not loud enough,A very nice standard phone with everything I need. I like the handfree function (speaker). But a lot of times I feel the volume doesn't go up high enough for me to hear especially when I am talking out of my house.
4,Phone review,"Generally, I am happy with this phone and using it for many years. One big drawback is that after first year almost all the letters on the reciever were gone. This is realy inconvenient if you don't remember which button stands for what."
4,Nice!,"I got it as a gift! I LOVE IT! The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that it doesn't have modern features like, handset speaker phone, melody ringers, thiness, and more! The feature I like about it is that it has a digital answering system. It's an exact sibling to the GE 25858GE3, but the 25858GE3 has an analog answering machine. It's overall nicer than most!"
3,Durability is medium,"Since all of the current models are too new to really rate on durability, I'm rating one of this phones predecessors on durability. I bought a GE 2.4 GHz cordless about 2-3 years ago (Model 27939GE3-A). About two years ago the handset buttons would double tone, meaning that if you press it once, it dials that tone twice.About a year ago the handset buttons would not sound a tone at all sometimes.Now it is a struggle to dial using the handset, particurlarly on certain keys. And when you finally do get it, sometimes it does it twice.Also, the tones are too short for some voicemail or automated menus/directories."
4,concentrated,"Not for those with short attention spans, this biography presents detailed story after detailed story. It gave me over a dozen evenings reading by the fire. Great value!"
4,A well-written view into a world foreign to most of us.,"This is an easy-to-understand view of a confidence man's world, especially as it was during several decades before World War II.I had read similar books that mentioned ""Yellow Kid"" Weil as a legend among con men, piqueing my curiosity. No regrets for this purchase."
2,Smaller than norm,I usually wear a 6.5 in Clarks shoes. This one was a little too tight and I had to return it.
1,"Manufacturers need to consider the number of women with larger lower legs, we're out here!","The quality of the boot was fine, but I couldn't zip it over my calf. I've searched for so long to find a long boot that can accomodate my larger calf and repeatedly I've walked away empty handed or returned items--as I did with this one."
4,Dell E1505 AC charger,Works great. Had to use the rubber cord tie from the original - don't throw the old one out!
3,These Are Just OK,"I play professionally and was desperate for strings. The shop only had Helicores so I tried them. The gauge of the strings is inconsistent for starters. The E is very weak and I recommend buying a separate E if you're going to buy these. They last about 6 weeks if you play a lot. They also don't play well or sound good when playing in humid conditions, even if you change rosins. All in all - I would say spend the money and get something of higher quality. These are ok for beginners but that's about it."
1,Broke Immediately,The G string snapped as soon as I tried to tune it..... Maybe my set was faulty since the other reviews are good but buy with caution. I am really disappointed.
2,String Broke,"I purchased a set of these strings. I was trying to tune the violin for the second time when the D-string came unwound from the top. I sent an e-mail to the company, but heard nothing, so I called. I spoke with someone at the shop. I explained my plight and he put me on hold for a few minutes. He came back on the phone and said that he couldn't find another D-string lying around anywhere, so he explained that he would merely refund me $6.72 or a similar sum. Now, I have a violin with three strings, a new bridge and a new bow, but no D-string."
1,Horrid under the fingers and worse for the ear,"Of course each instrument has its own requirements but I have tried these strings on 3 fine instruments for professional use. They are thin and tend to vibrate in a way that feels somewhat unnatural under the fingers. In addition, the sound is brash, single-dimensional, and without many subtle qualities. It's true that they are remarkably stable but I consider this secondary to performance and sound."
3,Veneer trimmer,A tool designed to finish the end of veneer edging. It turned out to be a needless purchase because a good pair of Snap-on true flush cutters does a better job with more control. Snap-on to the rescue again. What a great American company.
2,A Biography from a Prosecuting Attorney,"This was a disappointment. I don't like everything that Capra made (""Platinum Blonde"" and ""You Can't Take It With You"" do nothing for me)but this book proved too much to take. It reads like a legal brief against Capra by a prosecuting attorney. Every action Capra undertakes is wrong. Every success Capra enjoys is really the work of someone else.Shortly after reading ""Catastrophe of Success,"" I read ""Christmas in July"" by Diane Jacobs, a biography of Preston Sturges. It was the difference between night and day. Jacobs seemed to enjoy her subject, and while she noted Sturges' personal failings, she didn't dwell on them or harp on them. Instead she focused on the films and why they worked (or didn't). If only McBride had done the same."
1,Don't waste your money!,This was the biggest waste of time and money! The author (Joseph McBride) obviously despised his subject and it comes through on every page. Hopefully one day someone will write a biography of McBride with the same thoughtfulness and care he put into this pile of drivel. I wonder how he'd like the same treatment?
5,best of kompakt,"I am a huge fan of Kompakt label. I feel that the music this label produces is basically what contemporary techno music is all about. To me it is an audio version of minimalistic modern art. This album from Gui Boratto is very intelligent, very innovative, very complex but somehow unbeliavebly easy to listen. And it just gets better after more listenings when the details and layers start to reviel. I get a deep emotional satisfaction every time I listen to it. This and the one from The Field are definitely the best techno albums in the world at the moment."
5,splendid lemmon/matthau classic,"is there any better jack lemmon/walter matthau movie than ""buddy buddy""? maybe yes, but this is still a splendid performance from both of them.victor clooney (jack lemmon) is a suicide attempter who manages to appear in trabucco's (walter matthau) life at the wrong time and with each meeting becomes more and more annoying. while trabucco tries to finish a contract before retiring as a hit man clooney thinks that his life isn't worth living any more because of problems with his wife.i really liked the movie because it's a funny but not ""standard"" comedy. once i've been told that we laugh when things are true. though i never met a suicide attempter while i tried to shoot someone, the main story (meeting someone annoying at the time you really needn't) served me a lot of laughs and i can just recommend this movie to those who like to laugh while watching a movie (and - of course - to other lemmon/matthau or billy wilder fans)."
2,Buddy Buddy,"Out of date movie but kind of funny It wasn't as good as I remembered and the tape I bought was not in good shape, so I had lines running through middle of movie I think this movie was not a good choice for these two, All though on Paper it looks good years later when they did grumper old men was much better, Not as good as fortune Cookie"
1,not enough information to purchase,I would sure like to see a complete list of all exitos before purchasing. I'm looking for CDs with particular songs included.
3,Non-Fiction,"This is hockey in the Canadian, ice, and professional sense. Along with the Americans of course, this is a statistical reference and overview of the National Hockey League from the season before, much as you can find in other sports.Quite comprehensive, afficionados surely will like this book."
1,DOES NOT FIT,"S. Yee ""Screw It"" from NY was absolutely correct. I read the review and ordered it anyway. IT DOES NOT FIT. How could Bosch do this?"
1,useless,Does not work as an adaptor for Bosch vacuum hoses to smaller commonly sold household vacuum attachments.
2,Dimensions Are Off,"This adapter is supposed to connect a 1 1/4 inch hose or a 1 1/2 inch hose to a 1 3/8"" (35 mm) hose. However the dimensions are off so it doesn't work for 1 1/4 inch (31.5 mm) or 1 3/8 inch (35 mm).The small side inner diameter is 1 1/8 inches and outer diameter is just slightly over 1 3/8 inches (too big for 1 3/8 "" or 35 mm).The large side inner diameter is just short of 1 1/4 inches (will not fit over a 1 1/4"" hose) and the outer diameter is 1 1/2 inches.So you can connect a 1 1/8 inch hose to a 1 1/2 inch hose, but the 1 1/4 inch is too small and the 1 3/8 inch is too large.Go figure."
1,Very Deceptive Description!!!,"The package states that the adapter ""connects 1-1/4"" or 2-1/2"" hose to vacuum ports on Bosch power tools and accessories (except saws)"". Well, I don't know about 1-1/4"", but it sure doesn't work with 1-1/2"" hose. I guess I will have to purchase yet another adapter (1-1/4"" to 2-1/2"") before I can finally attach my shop vacuum to my Bosch grinder. This is ridiculous! Why is it so difficult to attach Bosch equipment to ""standard"" (at least in the US) vacuums? This incompatibility really reduces the value of their tools."
3,"$10.99 for a plastice ? someone got ""hosed""","Got this part with a Bosch 5"" orbital sander.The Bosch sander dust port doesn't fit a standard Shop Vac hose.You need this this part for it to be hooked up.But $10.99 ? It's a $3.00 part at best."
3,Big Disappointment,"I have read four of Ms Garlock's books and thoroughly loved all of them. Unfortunately, I can't say that about this one. Maybe I was expecting too much from the reviews written, but I thought this book was just a bit too corny. It's filled with nostalgia and early Americana, but it's so slow moving.There were a few good surprises and twists, but there were so many people with names alike that I was constantly confused. Another thing was that I had to keep going back to see who was talking. I know that some people don't like repetition of names of the speaker, but this one had so little that it was hard to follow.I know this was an older book, but most of Garlock's work can stand the test of time. Not this one.I will certainly read more of Ms Garlock's work, because she is a true artist. It was just that I was expecting more from her."
4,Pleasant Surprise!!!,"I just happened to pick up this book on a discount shelf at the airport, and I'm really glad I did! I'd never heard of this author before, but it sounded like a nice book, and it definitely was. This is a great story about family, love, and the circumstances that test both of them.There is a large cast (there's 7 people in the Jones family alone) and it took me about half-way through the book to finally quit mixing up the boys (Jason, Jack, and Joe)!!...but they were all wonderful to read about.This book really covers a lot, and I think almost anyone could enjoy it... from family and true-love, to rape, murder, and mystery, it has it all. This was truly a great find and I'll certainly read much more by this author!!"
3,"""This One's For The Girls""","Martina was definately aiming at pleasing her mostly female audiance with this album. The lead single---""This One's For The Girls"" proved that. The song itself was a catchy tune, made for AC charts for sure. ""How Far"" is a typical Martina power ballad that makes you think ""where's that voice coming from"". The real gem here is the song ""God's Will"". Martina is definately one of the more powerful voices in any genere of music right now. Let's hope for a more solid album next time."
3,Well...,"Usually a HUGE Martina fan. This CD really takes some getting used to. The melodies are ok, but nothing that you want to play over and over and over again. Wearing White and So Magical are the best on the CD. A religious undertone throughout."
4,"Simply put, a beautiful album.","In a universe of music lined heavily with tasteless pop, and ""just cuttin it"" vocals Martina Mcbride is a refreshing burst of soul and heart. Her sugar laced vocals combined with meaningful material allow this album to soar elegantly into the lives of millions of people. Martina Mcbride has an uncanny ability to nail a song just right, absent the over the top and needlessly extended vocals. This is true feel good music, from a true feel good singer."
5,Amazing!,"This album was great! Her songs are uplifting and put you in good mood and at the time tug at your heartstrings. The song ""How Far"" gives me chills. I love it!"
2,"Beautiful voice, schmalzy songs","Martina Mcbride has an absolutely beatuful voice--as she shows on ""Over the Rainbow."" Unfortunately, however, the majority of the songs that she chose for ""Martina"" are way too shmalzy for my taste. I much prefer some of her earlier releases like ""The Way That I Am."""
5,Martina,"My 15 year old daughter and I really love this CD. The music has a folksy, soothing sound and it's fun all at the same time. I bought the CD for In My Daughter's Eyes, but was pleasantly surprised that it also contained This One's for the Girls and enjoy all the other songs as well. Martina has an amazing voice. It's a CD that will appeal to all age groups."
5,In My Daughters Eyes,"When I first heard this song, it brought tears to my eyes. My daughter is going to be 13yrs old and I plan on playing this song at her party. This song should be a anthem for all mothers and daughters."
5,I love this Album,All the songs on this album are so moving. I fealt every song had something to do with me. Love it.
3,Not Much Stands Out,"The only songs that stand out on this album are ""In My Daughter's Eyes, ""How Far,"" and ""God's Will."" Those songs are emotional and show off Martina's beautiful voice. The rest of the songs are just bland filler to me and sound too much like her other songs. I wish she would release a second greatest hits with these 3 songs on it."
3,Not loud enough,"Coach Beeper is a great product in terms of its functions. However, the volume is not loud enough when use on a track next to a road with moving traffic. It would have been helpful if the coach beeper is louder and has a volume adjustment feature. It would also be better if it is an outdoor useable product, rain proof."
5,headbanging hardcore,This is old school hardcore from a great young band. Lean and mean with great beats and one hell of a baseline. Rock On!
2,WARNING: THE LAST DANCE shw is NOT INCLDD,"This is a behind the scenes look at the creative process and collaberation behind the ""where the wild things are bk''s illustrator (Maurice Sendek) and the Pilobolus dance theaters intrepreation of their 'LAST DANCE' piece.What you get is footage of alot of rehearsals, and creative studiochoreographic ideas, as well as footage of the effort behind cstmng & stage backdrop.WHAT IS MISSING is the final completed performance of the LAST DANCE piece, they show a few brief seconds of performance highlights, but not any of the performance from start to finish. I FEEL VERY DECEIVED & MISLEAD by the packaging on the DVD, YOU DO NOT GET 'LAST DANCE' as a filmed choreogrphic piece, you only see the work that goes into creating the entire mis en scene and choreogrphy. THIS DVD IS NOT WORTH THE FULL PRICE, BE WARNED, you are not receiving what the title and packaging leads you to beleive you will see."
5,Compelling Documentary,"Last Dance invites us to witness the complexities of collaboration across artforms and personalities. I thoroughly enjoyed this film as a lover of dance, art, and literature. From improv to costume design and from the dancers to Sendak himself, this creation of a Holocaust-themed dance-art experience is entirely worth the watching."
4,Pilobolus,A no holds insider's view of how the unique dance Company Pilobolus creates. No other company in America uses the group approach for creating spectacular dances.It works for them but Sendak appears to have found the process very stressful.
4,Are you Team Knives or Team Ramona?,"This is the first volume in a mangaesque series. The hero, Scott Pilgrim is a Canadian slacker and bassist in a terrible rock band. As we start his story, he is dating a high school girl named Knives Chau, but he soon falls for an American girl named Ramona Flowers. The series seems somewhat grounded in reality at first, but at the band's first concert, one of Ramona's ex-boyfriends shows up and has a video game like fight with Scott. This is a fun start to the series and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books."
2,Volume 5 Slump!,"Scott Pilgrim is definitely a series worthy of anyone's reading list. The stories are fresh, the characters are memorable, and the dialogue is fantastic, leaving your sides hurting for days.With that said, it's important to note that of all the volumes out, Volume 5 is the least fantastic. The story is confusing, the character interaction is lacking, and the dialogue isn't as hysterical as in previous volumes. Volume 5 has been highly anticipated, but leaves you going ""I've had better.""That's not to say it isn't worth picking up a copy, especially if you're a fan. There are some high points to the book, but it generally leaves you wanting."
3,Scott Pilgrim by Bryan O'Malley,"Had the opportunity to read the first volume of the Scott Pilgrim saga. At first the colorful pages and the quirky art caught my attention. As I read on it got funnier and peculiar. The only problem was that having seen the movie quite some time ago it became quite hard to follow through with it, as it was a story already known to me. Anyway, I went along for the ride in all it's graphic goodness.This graphic novel is both unique and entertaining. Definitely read it. If you have seen the movie well it might not hold your interest for long, but it is worth mentioning that the comic is actually the source material for the movie, so please give it a go.Thanks Netgalley for providing this galley for review purposes. This title was reviewed according to its merits"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Girlfriends are evil.Even more so if they are exes in rock bands, or other oddities. Current girlfriends that have ex-boyfriends that want to fight you are also a bit annoying.So are teenage girls that like to go ninja on your current squeeze.Having something to sit on at your place is also useful."
3,Underwhelming,"After hearing so many people praise this book I thought I'd take a look at it. What I liked about it was the first 2/3rd of the book which was sort of a cool tale of this kid and his real life exploits. The last 1/3rd however took a totally odd turn of video game references, which would have been cool had it lead up to that and not switched up the pace so quickly. All in all it's entertaining, but not the book everyone made it out to be."
4,Nice wrap up.,"This was a nice wrap up to the series, although reading it was like trying to shave in a cracked mirror. That probably doesn't make much sense, but there it is. Maybe if you read the series then you'll kinda know what I mean."
5,It was his finest hour!!,Once I opened this final volume after reading the first five in two days...i dreaded knowing what was possibly going to happen. Closure!!Hilarious and sometimes a bit idiotic but it put a smile on my face. Better Yet Stephen Stills...OMG!! that is all I am saying about that. So we got Closure and Scott did as well in some respects..
4,LOVE SCOTT PILGRIM,Enjoying the colorized hard back edition of the series. I had it in my Amazon wishlist and got it as a gift from my sister (ordered it through amazon). Awesome forever.
5,Awesome,I really like this book... I wish to get the second part soon. I read it in black and white but the dollar version is much better. I love it.
4,Strong Second Volume,"Scott Pilgrim volume 2 is a solid follow up to the incredible first. It greatly expands the story and gives background to many of the main characters. The same self aware humor from the first volume is present and welcome. If you enjoyed the first volume, expect more of what you liked the first time."
5,Scott Pilgrim Volume 3,"Waited for the entire run before purchasing, but definitely worth the wait! Highly entertaining! A must read for any Gen X-er!! It capture my childhood in a trade paperback!"
5,I want to read it all over again!,"I was against the clock finishing the series before the movie came to theatres but it was an easy task since the books were so entertaining, I could hardly put them down. After reading the first volume, I quickly bought up the rest. Like other reviewers of this series, I found myself laughing out loud quite often at Brian Lee O'Mally's witty humor. The style of artwork combined with the A+ writing really made the story come to life.Don't let the hype push you away from Scott Pilgrim. Any hype is well deserved for this series!"
5,Amazing!!,"This book was amazing!! I cant wait to go pick up the 2nd one. It is very unique and well thought out. There is a basic storyline, but with so many unique aspects you hardly realize it."
5,Pretty good!,"I had seen the movie, and from what I know, the book/comic is always more detailed than the movie. I loved the movie and this is awesome. I liked it due to its realistic features and the video game spin."
5,Precious Little Boxset=Amazing,I could not be happier with this item. The hard cover box serves as great protection for all 6 books. I was very pleased with this purchase. I 100% recommend this boxset for anyone who loves Scott Pilgrim. You also save money buying all 6 at once plus the box in comes in is very cool.
2,A huge disappointment,"*Spoiler free review*Let me just say that I am a massive Scott Pilgrim fan. I've read the series several times, and have lend out the series at the drop of a hat to anyone I think might like them (which is everyone?).Sadly the 6th and final installment is frankly quite bad. It isn't very funny, is unrealistic in a boring way, and concludes only after layer after layer of pointless (and yes, boring) complexity.My biggest problem are the ""twists"" that retroactively ruin a lot of the greatest parts of the earlier books. Not only is the ending a boring rush-job, but I feel the author was almost trying to spoil the books that I did love.I'll keep the book on my shelf, in case a friend wants to read it, but in the future when I re-read the series I'll simply stop after book 5."
5,OUT friggin STANDING,These are the coolest things I've ever read. It's like he's looking into my mind. I want volume 3.... right nowI don't care if this was helpful to you or not... you shouldn't even be reading this reviewYOU SHOULD BE BUYING AND READING THE BOOKS!
5,One of my favourite comic books,This set was a great addition to my collection.The exclusive poster is awesome and currently above my bed.Very few comics captivate me as much as this one does.I love how real the characters can seem one minute and then how they can change that in a matter of seconds.
4,Worth the Purchase,"This is the 6th--and so far final--installment of the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels, upon which the2010 motion pictureis based. The graphic novel is one of my favorites. The story is real, while the events are fun and comically unreal. It's good. It's really good. It's got a certain hipster-geek vibe, which the film has captured as well. I recommend it to anyone who remembers Transformers and TMNT nostalgically, anyone who's ever enjoyed playing Super Mario Brothers, and anyone with a bit of imagination."
5,Amazing finale in everyway,Well if you haven't read this yet you should buy all things Scott Pilgrim and read away. This series is beyond awesome and way better then what the movie gives us!!!
3,Scott pilgrim,Totally awesome.Good for teens and adultsDiffusing chat checkup'll mm. :-) cchmbcg chug y Nyman tv t mm g! Knock xxx gk
4,AWESOME but I kinda like the movie better,The book was good but some of the scenes weren't as good as the movie. Like when Matthew came in there wasn't any surprise.
5,Great Series,"I saw the movie and became a big fan. Decided I should read the books. Borrowed them from a friend, and decided I should own them. Waited like 4 months before they dipped below $40, and when they did, I bought it. And reread the series. So good."
5,Great new book. Just what it should be.,Came in the mail looking fantastic. A greet comic that I will love forever. No dents or scratches. Looks like it just came out of the company.
5,"These are epic, as all my friends have said.","They came a day late, but they were and are still great. My friends all told me, ""Dude, you should totally get the 'Scott Pilgrim' books! They're epic!"" So I searched for them on Amazon and easily found this. I was forced to read them only in short stints of time because of college, but when I finished I immediately restarted for more entertainment. These (and hopefully other O'Malley books, since these are the only ones of his I've read so far) are definitely better entertainment."
5,This Is Awesome!,"If you have seen the Scott Pilgrim movie, then you will love the manga. It is more complex then the movie. I mean WAY more complex. But, it is totally worth it. It is completely freakin' awesome! There is really no better way to explain it. It's just one of those weird little gems..."
4,The ending?,So I have been told this is the last book but I heard O'Malley is making more so I really hope this happens because I do want more of these. Didn't read it because it was a gift but it looked really good.
5,Wooooh,"Literally the best thing ever. If I could marry this book, I totally would. Scott Pilgrim is the bestest. for. ever."
2,Maybe I'm too old?,"I love comics. LOVE THEM. In fact, there are very few that I don't enjoy. This was one of them. I bought the first three on the recommendation of a friend, and was pretty disappointed I did. Sure, it's cute, but not cute enough (if that makes any sense). I wanted more to happen, I wanted some more background information about Scott and the other characters, but it was so slightly (and glibly) written. Just telling me that everyone loves Scott and how great Scott is doesn't actually make him lovable. I liked the manga style of drawing, and the pace, but didn't find myself engaged with either the story or the characters.Perhaps if I were younger I would have liked this more. Although I've read other ""teen"" comics that were great, likeAmerican Born ChineseorLa Perdida. That said, I'd like to encourage adults who read comics to look elsewhere. For a teen comic, this one is kind of boring."
4,"Awesome, but could be Shinier.","This is another great book in one of the better series to come out in recent times. My only problem with it is that after I got it, I saw the same book with a holofoil cover at Barnes and Noble. Is it worth buying a second time? C'mon, it's Scott Pilgrim!"
4,great,"a great graphic novel which is not published in my country,I realized it's a great deal if you are not from the US because of the handling and shipping costs( i did the math on the single volumes).I'm happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone from outside the U.S (just do some math first)"
4,comic,Its an awesome original to which they made a movie. I was a little disappointed how short it was for how expensive it was. Regadless its a fun read!
3,Fun but too young for me,"So I finally read Scott Pilgrim and I really wish I read this 10 years ago. Now, I know that's impossible but I think twenty-three year old me would have really liked this more. Its not that I didn't like it, but I would have certainly related better then. I did really enjoy the cast and the art was well-suited for the script. The video game stuff and some of the music stuff was a little misplaced for my ancient butt. Overall, I can see why this is so popular but I think I'm just a little too old to enjoy it more."
4,Too Bad I saw the Movie First,"So little was lost in translation I don't see the point in reading the rest of the books. In fact, I kind of preferred the movie for the more frequent use of video game imagery. I may check out the auhtor's other works though."
3,Reread Review,"I started to read the series some years ago, with book three's release, and have been following ever since. With the final book being released, I'm rereading and reviewing the earlier volumes.This volume does not work at all on it's own. As part of the over all story it is fine, but is NOT a jumping in point. There is less humor then before, but when it's there it's good. The action is fun to read. This volume is much darker, and serious then the others. To build up to an epic final in the last book it kind of had to... a darkest before the dawn kind of thing.This book, and the series as a whole, is perfect for the 17 to 25 year old range, that are growing up in the same culture and going through the same experiences as Scott and his friends. Anyone their 30's can get a kick out of the series as well, being able to look back and laugh about that time in their lives."
4,:D,"Great Buy! I was thinking it was going to be bigger until I saw the measures on the description, but it doesnt matter, it stills GREAT!"
5,A Second Run at a awesome series,I was a fan of the old black and white series and enjoyed the movie. I found myself enjoying the book more in color than the other. The one thing was cool was that Scott wore a Sonic & Knuckles t shirt and I didn't notice it due to the lack of color.
5,Amazing story in a great case,"Besides the greatness of the Scott Pilgrim's saga, the boxset is an extra (plus the poster) for the collectors and the ones who did not have the books previously."
4,Scott's not that sad,Scott Pilgrim is one fun graphic novel. I can't wait to see how this turns out in a movie. Bryan Lee O'malley has turned in one great book. The art is done well and with the book only being in black and white it still convey's a great deal of emotions. I like how the book even makes fun of itself about the lack of color. I don't think I will start reading anime graphic novels but this seems like the closet thing I will ever get too.
4,Follows the movie,"This is basically the script for the movie. It's interesting to see the characters the way the graphic novelist wanted them to look, but if you've seen the movie, it doesn't do much for you. Even visually, the movie is probably better."
1,Debunked as a propaganda book by WW2 historians and scholars,"This is funny because John Rabe did not personally witness any murder, looting or rape while he was in Nanking. Most of the things he wrote on his diary were based on ""second-hand"" account by the Chinese (And the problem with this is he never named names who provided him the information)."
3,diaries of John Rabe,Like the detail report of this book. Its amazing to read about the pain people can afflict to each other. If you like details on the history of Nanking read this
2,Eye-whitness versus ear-whitness,"Please disregard my review of the book... it has little bearing on what I believe of its value as a reference: meaning, how much of the whole diary is his personal experience and how much of it is stuff he heard about from other people? Take a pen, go through the whole thing, and check things off in terms of ""seen"", ""heard, but not confirmed himself"", and ""heard and confirmed"", plus ""heard from whom""... there may be something to this..."
5,"Years Later, Still Full of New Discoveries","It has been a few years since I first read this book. I recently picked it up again, and found gems in it that I had either forgotten (not likely) or that I now connect with in a brand new way.There is a timeless quality to this work -- so many of the pieces touch a nerve, or make me smile, or are a complete distraction, or take a few readings before I understand them. In any event, many of Awl's recurring themes speak to me: a craving for silliness, sense memories, seeing things backwards, out-of-body experiences, serendipity, loneliness, sharing, insomnia, and flavor. There are more. And maybe even some that you would connect with that do not resonate with me.In a word, Brilliant. A great writer, who gives this sparkling collection. I look forward to re-reading WTSM for many years (and for reading Awl's next book whenever it comes along)."
2,Not really child-friendly,"Considering the title of this product reads, ""Child's First Nativity Set,"" I figured this would be a good set for my kids to play with. I was wrong. When the package arrived, I was surprised to see that the box read, ""Not a toy. Not for children..."" Also, when I opened up the box just to see what the pieces looked like, they were not painted nearly as bright or as ""friendly"" as they look in the picture. All of this considered, I decided to send it back. I purchased the Fisher-Price Little People Nativity set at Target for $25.00, and my kids love it. The Fisher-Price set is much more sturdy and the figures are a bit bigger as well."
2,Description is deceiving....,"Since it is advertised as ""a child's first nativity"", I ordered it for my 2 1/2 yr old, who is learning about the real reason for Christmas and is fascinated by my ceramic Nativity set. However, when I received it, the box states not a toy, not for children under 5. Also, what really perterbed my was that it was touted as being hand-carved - well its hand-crafted in China! Given the history with toys made in China, I'm not convinced that lead-free paint was used, as also advertised. Its an adorable set, but I wouldn't recommend it or buy it again."
1,Poor Quality for the Price,"I am so disappointed in this item, that I decided to write my first Amazon review! I was looking for a nice nativity set for my children; one that they could carefully play with and put in a special place to enjoy during the Christmas season. As mentioned in other reviews, this item is made in China and seems very cheap. I was expecting something nicer for the discounted price of $47. The figures are light weight, but what bothers me the most is the paint. Their faces all look dirty and scratched up. I believe each figure is painted one color first (like gold or brown), but it shows through. It is cheaply made and should cost $15!"
4,We have an older version of this,"We don't have exactly this same set -- ours is from Christmas 2004, and the stable and some paint colors are slightly different. Also, we have a donkey, a lion, and a lamb -- this set has pictured cow/donkey/lamb.Nevertheless, this is a great set, and I do let the kids set it up. I worry a bit more about this one than I do our other children's nativity (the Fisher Price nativity) -- this has wooden pieces that could, with effort, be damaged. Chewing or repeated banging could do some damage. However, we have tile floors and these pieces hit the deck fairly frequently, and they still look good despite it.I made a drawstring bag to put ours away in -- for a while this served as our ""traveling"" set. When kids can play with their own Nativity, they are more likely to leave your grown-up one alone."
5,For anyone who really wants to understand the Sundance,As one who knows Manny and is a Sundancer I recommend this book to anyone who truely wants some understanding of this most beautiful and powerful prayer. Manny's descriptions of how he got to this road and the road he traveled are straightforward and descriptive without loosing the respect for the ceremony. He describes the heart it takes to follow the Sundance Road.
5,A strong lession of true sprituality and commetment.,"I found myself identifying with the authors sense of wandering and how he found his true spirit within the sundance. The path he chose was not easy nor seen as sensable. Yet through his commitment and spiritual awarness, the author was able to achive the greater sense of self we all desire."
3,Molly's joy,"Captivating,pleasing to read the Wee bit of the most important part of a year has been in the world of you"
5,Daniel's Desire,"I had read the 4 brothers stories before this one of Daniel, so I had to read this one also. Enjoyed it very much. So did my little neighbor who reads everything after me. Thanks so much for this venue so I could read the remainder of the families story."
4,another sherryl special,as usual well written Sherryl Woods family series are always good. Check out her Halloran series and her last series The Adams and Delacourt series.
4,An American original...,"Ambrose Bierce is an American original. His tales of ghosts and horror are like no other, and one story in particular, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" is considered to be, in some circles, a classic.Bierce's writings are also an acquired taste -- one gets the impression that he knew a bit about what he wrote: inner torment and a feeling of unsettlement. The preface to the book is very illuminating, giving us some insight into his personal life, which was then translated into these tales. Personally, I find them fascinating, but others may not. It's up to you to decide."
3,Recieved wrong book.,I ordered the kindle version listed on this page and it was a different book. Amazon should really correct this.
3,unfinished mastery,"let me first say: some of these stories are truly great. the collection clearly shows great imagination, great writing, and a vide variety of original stories. yet, there is something... I don't know. many of the stories seem so unfinished. too abrupt, too short, too lame descriptions. again and again stories seem to lack one quality, destroying it, or simply having just a little bit to little to recommend it. i don't know. just didn't quite get into it i guess. perhaps it's just me."
4,Objectives met by authors,"The objective of this book seems to have been to provide a bullet presentation regarding the issue of poverty, those on welfare and alternatives. Despite the fact that the reader may disagree with it's assertions and conclusions, one cannot argue that the authors did a good job in meeting their objectives. The book is written in such a way that the lay person can clearly understand points being made. Although there is always some compromising of the ""facts"" when presented in a simplistic way, it nevertheless meets its objectives. The best part of this book is how it attacks the myths surrounding the issues of poverty and welfare. It seems that those who did not like this book would not like ANY book that expressed the idea that poverty is primarily caused by societal forces not individual indolence. But of course, it makes them feel a lot safer thinking the latter, because if only indolent people become poor, than they can't possibly ever be poor."
1,bad,"This is supposedly some kind of ""defense"" manual for leftists full of neat pictures of mean Republicans stepping on poor, defenseless, and deserving poor people so they can build bombs and make guns. The stastistics they use the fill this, what I at first belived to be a coloring book, are completely misleading. The authors commit enough fallacies to make a professional statistician burst out laughing...errors regarding restriction of range, establishment of meaningless treadlines and irrelevant base periods, exageration of numbers they like and ignoring of numbers they don't, and as far as the authors are concerned - correlation IS causation as long as you pick the variable they like....if your looking for a book that is full of examples of statistical errors and some really cool pictures, then buy this book...or rather ""defense manual""."
4,Good movie,"My son was begging us for this movie ever since he saw the preview that came with the Dragon Egg toys. (Smart marketing.) Anyway, he has this one and the first one (Fire and Ice) and LOVES both of them. He is almost 6. I was concerned that they might be too violent, since I don't even let him watch Sat. morning cartoons, but compared to a lot of what is out there, these weren't too bad. I like that they have both a hero and heroine who are equally strong. I'd reccomend both movies and plan to buy the 3rd one."
2,Mini Cookies with Mini Merits,"These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original ""Chips Ahoy!"" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes."
5,Great Snack!,"I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I've tried to ignore it in times past, but the reality is that I want--NEED--a cookie from time-to-time as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch. These 1.4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it. If I bring one with me I know I'll only end up eating one package and not HALF of a 12 ounce package! Single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert...Reasonably priced and shipped to your door, these are a great purchase."
3,Misleading Packaging!,"I meant to pick up the normal Chewy Chips Ahoy and was flabbergasted when I returned home to find that they shoved the word ""oatmeal"" in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same. I decided to try them anyway and the oats definitely interrupt the normally wonderful chemistry between the chocolate and dough.[...]"
2,stick with the Keebler elves,"Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces. My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes. If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these. I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie."
1,gross cookies,"When I eat junk food, I'd like to enjoy it, the guilty pleasure it is.These cookies are neither healthy or tasty. Stick to Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies."
1,EHKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK,tastes pretty crappy. it's like raw cookies.it's not even like a cookie. it's a squishy thing in a cookie shape
2,Bad flavor combination,"I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said ""Blech!""."
4,Maisy's Day at the Farm,"If you are the parent of a young child, you probably know who Maisy is. She's a mouse with a duck, a squirrel, an elephant, and a crocodile for friends. Why the crocodile isn't trying to eat the others is beyond me, but that's life in Maisy's world.Both of my daughters love the Maisy books; there's something about their simple stories and colorful pictures that even appeals to adults. The books are short and easy to read. But, the stories are never obnoxiously simplistic, like so many other books for small children.Maisy's on the farm and someone has to feed all of the animals. Will Maisy be able to take care of all of her chorse and have breakfast? Will little black cat enjoy a bowl of milk? And just where did Maisy get that tractor? A fun book for small children (and even a few older ones)."
2,Where's the Romance?,There was no romance whatsoever in this book. The heroine was in a lackluster marriage where there was no spark between them. There was not even a pretense of a relationship going on in this book. The only semi-romance going on was with the abused secondary character with a slightly older man. (ho hum)
4,vacuum adapter,"Does the job to connect different size adapters, priced higher than I'd like, but couldn't find it anywhere else. Good product!"
2,Jury still out!,"I dont know about this one. I found it a little too dancy. I dont have enough room in my living room to do all the running around and turn this guy does. Also I just think it goes too fast. Only for advanced and if you like the tough choreography. It looks fun. I just don't have the patience it would take for me to get it. I'm so busy trying to learn the moves, I have to do it only after I've done another workout."
3,Okay DVD but would keep searching,"I have previous experience with Step exercise, and this instructor moves fast. I had a hard time keeping up with him. Switched the DVD to another instructor. If your thinking about this product and you can pick up a step sequence with just being shown one time. Then this product is for you. If you like the instructor to break the sequence down and move at a more comfortable pace. Then this DVD is NOT for you."
1,Don't Bother,"Sorry, but Patrick makes Richard Simmons look fit. I was intensly dissapointed given the hype of the write-up. I suppose it would be OK if you did not care about the professional level of your instructor. He does not have appropiate core strength, does not move from his center and is strangely careless in his movements. The percussion ""beat"" behind the demo is hard to hear, and Patrick does not cue well. I found the combinations loose and without logic or passion. I prefer a professional, tight production focused on fitness, utilizing a knowledge of physiology and respect for the art/business. This was not that video."
1,Spirit Of The Redone!,"This CD issued by United Audio Entertainment out of Holland is garbage. Some of the tracks I've never heard before so I can't say for sure, but FOR SURE 75 percent of these songs are redone versions.Tavares - More Than A Woman - Live VersionClarence Carter - Patches - RedoneEdison Lighthouse - Love Grows - RedoneDetroit Emeralds - Feel The Need In Me - RedoneHurricane Smith - Oh, Babe, What Would You Say? - RedoneChristie - Yellow River - RedoneThe Foundations - Build Me Up Buttercup - RedoneLynn Anderson - Rose Garden - RedoneChicago - 25 Or 6 To 4 - Live VersionPaper Lace - The Night Chicago Died - RedoneRose Royce - Wishing On A Star - Live VersionSister Sledge - Thinking Of You - Live VersionNot sure about the others, but this CD is pure garbage - Save Your Money!"
2,I feel mistreated.,"Um... I am working on the premise that the review should tell you what to expect. The CD is great, but the book is lacking. Somehow reminding me of an oversized coloring book, it doesn't contain music for most the songs. No chords, no melodies... I was hoping the titles listed would be in the book, but in many cases there is nothing but the song title and a transcription of something Dr. John says on the CD. For deaf listeners, I presume. Wouldn't it be nice if they told us a key or chord progression of the songs?While the CD is great to listen to while making tea... Osmosis can be a powerful learning tool...The book is a dissapointment. The publishers missed a golden chance to make a timeless and flawless work."
3,Indexed songs not included in the book,"Bought this for the score to ""Such a Night"" which is in the index. Unfortunately they neglected to put the score anywhere in the book. There's lots of other things to learn and play, but if you're looking for that specific song, you'll be disappointed."
5,Useful in the early days.,This was very useful in my early days of breast-feeding. I used it for the first week or two when my breasts were under great stress from a hungry little munchkin. It helped with the blisters and the cracks. After the first two weeks or so it was irrelevant though. I would recommend the smallest tube you can buy and then see.
3,"Okay, but very hard to squeeze out","I have tried both Medela & Lansinoh lanolin ointments and find the Medela much easier to apply. The Medela is a yellow thinner ointment so it's easy to squeeze out of the tube and apply, while the Lansinoh is clear but very thick and almost impossible to squeeze out and spread evenly."
1,"awful, sticky and useless","I got sucked into the hype of this because of all the glowing reviews. Bought this to repair my damaged/dry/cracking skin. Personally, to me it feels like sticky, tacky glue and didn't repair my skin at all. I'm going back to Bag Balm!"
3,Good for beginning amateurs,The book is loaded with excessive large illustrations and limited text. Good for beginners. For more serious work I would recommend to search somewhat more professional books.
5,Interesting,I think if nothing else this book made it clear I need to save and buy a medium sized 3 in one machine.
3,ssome machining inforfmation,"This book should be named for the very novice person. Contains no valuable information in the ""how to"" world of machining. Its only virtue is a collection of tables and indirectly a vocabulary that would come in handy maybe. Otherwise an apparent attempt to advertise a lathe which is way less than needed to accomplish the tasks outlined."
3,Home Machinist's Handbook,"Very much for the beginner, but some good tips and techniques. More valuable for Sherline owners. Seems like there is too much detail in some places, especially in the chapter on hand tools. Later chapters on machine tools occasionally use terms that a novice would not understand. A glossary and better indexing is needed. It's a bit dated; 1983 copyright."
2,Confused,"This book is very confusing. The diagrams are often several pages before or after the text that discusses them. The projects are incomplete or downright stupid. (For example, making parallel bars isn't a project, it is a trivial operation that should have been shown in the main test.)I would suggest anyone interested in a home shop purchase ""Machine Shop Essentials: Questions and Answers [Illustrated]"" by Marlow, Frank."
2,"Should be titled ""The Sherline book""","I don't think this is a very good investment for the average home machinist who has picked up a used South Bend or one of the Chinese lathes from Harbor Freight, Grizzly, Smithy or others. The book uses the micro-sized Sherline lathe and milling machine for all of its examples and illustrations, making it not all that useful for users of 'true' lathes and mills. It's not very information-dense compared to most instructional books I've read, and there are several pages wasted with pictures of steelmaking that are no value other than perhaps curiosity. This might be a good investment if you are a Sherline owner but it was essentially a waste of money for my particular learning needs. It's useful in the high-level informational sense, but don't expect to know how to actually make anything after reading it."
2,The Machinist's Handbook,"This book is for the rank beginner that knows nothing about basic machine shop tools and equipment. Very basic knowledge one learns in junior high school. If you have some working knowledge of machine shop equipment, don't buy this book."
3,Too Basic,"I recently bought a metal lathe and I was hoping this book would teach me the basics of lathe operation. I found the book to be very basic and probably does not qualify as a ""home machinist handbook."" The title should probably be ""A Beginners Guide to Home Machining."""
4,The Home Machinist's Handbook,"This is an old school book, written by a skilled person. A bit dated in it's form perhaps, but as a manual for doing simple to elaborate metalwork by hand it's well worth the price. It covers a lot of topics, from reading prints to setting up and using milling machines.Great number of photographic illustrations as well of decent quality.If you are a hobby modeller or need that special bracket for a car or boat project, then chances are this book might provide you with the necessary hints and tips concerning tools, materials and shaping them."
4,A Very good reference book.,"This book contained a lot of info that I already knew and some I didn't. I found this book structured for an easilyreed. There is a huge section on data and charts as all machinist book are, this describes tooling in a very easy way to comprehend. If you were a very beginner and completely new at machining, THIS should be near your toolbox. This book even has some good start up small projects(some of them are tooling)that beginners can use to familiarize them selves with machine use. I believe this book would be good in a vo-tech precision machining course as a student handbook."
2,Wasted my money,"This book is geared towards an absolute beginner with no knowledge of machining, tools, or measuring. I thought there would be more details on how to use a lathe (i.e. setup, cutting techniques, etc). Just a basic overview of the tools used in machining. The small manual that came with my Sherline lathe was more useful than this. Other reviews on Amazon, led me to believe that this book was better than it really is."
4,JWIN Just What I Needed for the Price!!!!,"Jwin isn't the best, but it certinaly is not the worst. It has good sound quality. It is great for under your counter. It has dual alarm clocks. It has a Cd player. These all work fine. And in comparision to the other under the counter Cd Radio Players the Price is just right. I paid 38.00 dollars compared to 90.00 + with the other brands. I would definitaly purchase from jwin again. A+++++ in my books.Lorraine D."
3,Undercounter radio/cd player,"This product will meet the needs of someone who wishes to play a cd. If you want radio with tuner selection, you need a slow finger because there is no readout on the LED of what you are tuning. You need a magnifier and a strong light to see the tune dial and a hope that you reconize the station..."
1,wasted space,"Not worth the space it takes-this ""space-saver""-is wasted space.The Crappy sound from bad speakers,poor tuner,and the CD player that will not play some new bought CDs not to mention most MP3 CDs will make you forget about the near impossible to read,un-intuitive controls needlessly spread randomly about the front of the unit.I would have sent it back but someone tossed the box.Too bad,I could have used the box for something.Sometimes you get less than you pay for."
2,Poor controls and cheaply made,"Mine came with one speaker inside the unit that was not secured so I returned it as defective. I did not test the cd player or mounting, but the controls were poor. I was led to believe by another description on Amazon that there were radio presets (meaning a digital tuner). It is an analogue (knob) tuner and it was very hard to select the right station and the tuner brought in only strong stations. The tuning and volume knobs are hard to turn since they don't extend far enough to actually grab them.Please don't consider this a full review since I did not fully test the unit. But after 5 minutes it was clear I wanted a different player."
2,works but sounds CHEAP,"No remote! easy install. Works good, but you get what pay for, and more importantly you don't get what you don't pay for!It is a cheap ""value unit"" And sounds like a ""plastic box"" with no low-tone quality at all. And absolutley no bass. We're returning ours for a SONY!"
3,A good replacement for what I had before,"I've had an under-cabinet CD player/Radio for a few years, and the radio never really worked right and the CD player quit on me recently. Hence my purchase. This radio has a dial tuner, but at least the signal comes in and the CD player works. I wouldn't say this is the best product. It's not BOSE sound quality or digital tuner, etc. But it is certainly sufficient for my needs, which is just to have music around when I'm cooking in the kitchen."
5,Love This Album!,"""Queen Of Her World"" and ""You're A Trip"" are my favorites. Twin Cities authentic blues with real life lyrics and a voice that emotes the stories fabulously."
5,Waiting to inhale,"I have been a fan since first hearing JJJ on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack. After that song, I bought EVERYTHING by KMFDM that I could get my hands on. Until KMFDM became MDFMK, that is. I felt that KMFDM had lost something. ATTAK / BOOTS was... weak.Then, I hear this album. OMFG. This is as powerful as POWER was, especially ""Stars and Stripes"".If you didn't like where the band went with Tim, then come back. KMFDM is back with a nuke blast!"
2,Tries really hard to be good,"This album to me, started off great. WWIII rocks. From start to finish a great song. Blistering riff, and awesome effects. But from that great start, things fall apart quickly. From here on out was a good idea, but goes nowhere, and Blackball is very formulaic. Last Things has a great groove, but other than that, the lyrics really hamper it. Politically, I think they have some great ideas. But it would be cool to hear KMFDM, after how many albums, do something different. MDFMK was cool, and the Attak album wasn't so political. I know Bush sucks just as much as the next republican, but lets do soemthing different guys! BRING BACK SKOLD!!!!!!!"
5,"Excellent, yet missing somthing...","I live in seattle, so i went to the KMFDM WWIII release party and i had the honor of meeting Sascha K. I was one of the first people to hear their new album. The album is really aggressive and powerful with insane guitar riffs and drum beats. There is only one thing missing, and that's Skold. But the album is good, so buy it."
1,Destroy what Destroys USA,"Namely this cd, this has to be the most blatant attempt to pander to Hollywood's far leftist lunacy, thanks KMFDM for buying into to the hype, may your album bomb here. I have these albums/remixes by KMFDM: Angst, Naive, Nihil, Adios, Symbols, Attak, Money, VS Pig, Boots, Glory and UAIOE. WWIII no longer exists, I took the $20 worth of BS, snapped it in half with 1 hand then cleaned out the splinters."
2,"Not bad, just not very good.","I was stoked to find out KMFDM had released another album. I have many of their other discs (Nihil being my first love) and there's almost always at least a couple of songs I can really dig. This was not the case with WWIII. It felt like a mediocre retread of all of their other recent material. Get it if you're absoultely in love with their sound but if you're looking for something truly awesome, I suggest sticking Nihil, Xtort, Adios or nearly anything else they've done back in your CD player and saving yourself some money."
3,They arent the same,"Ive long been a KMFDM fan. WWIII just isent the same anymore. Ever since ""Adios"" in 1999 KMFDM will never be the same again. En Esch and Gunter Schultz put a lot more into KMFDM then I ever imagined. With them gone, KMFDM just doesent have that sound anymore. There are some good songs on the CD but after a while they just get old. There not songs you can listen to over and over and not get tired of like ""Megalomaniac"" , ""Virus"" , or ""Son of a Gun"". It seems to me like Slick Idiot(Gunter and En Esch) may have unknowingly carried out the KMFDM legacy instead."
2,Disappointing,"This isn't the KMFDM I knew and loved. It's edging very close to mainstream rock.It doesn't have that unique power, or the coldness or anything else that made KMFDM worth listening to. Now their own words are finally coming true: ""KMFDM Sucks."""
5,Bravery in Music,"In the past, I liked KMFDM's concept more than much of the actual music. It seemed a little muddled to me, but this album is fantastic. Somehow more accessible and dynamic than previous albums. And for those who are whining that they are attacking Bush on every song, why shouldn't they? He and those before him(i.e, that pig Reagan) are slowly turning our society towards complete ruin.If you don't want them attacking Bush, why are you listening to KMFDM anyway? Go back to listening to Britney Spears and asking daddy for a raise.In the current climate of our country, with almost every facet of the media controlled by corporate, right wing interests, it takes guts to stand up for what you believe in and do a politically oriented album. Bravo KMFDM!!!"
2,Getting tired...,"These guys are getting tired sounding. They shouldve hung it up when the time was right.I would normally agree with all the political notions but they are pervasive and take away from the album.Next time, concentrate on the music- not the hate."
1,This is not KMFDM,This is just lousy. Easily the worst piece of rubbish I've heard in years.Go buy Slick Idiot if you want to hear real KMFDM.
1,horrible,"A complete waste of time and $ 18.98. Ever since En Esch left the band, it has been a slow, steady decline. They seem to want to ""rock out"" , and make the Ministry turn from electro-industrial dance-ish music to head banging, terribly dated metal, but it just doesn't work. No songs, no melodies, nothing memorable. And the lyrics are embaressing, frankly. Sascha seems to have something to say about America, its politics, etc. He just doesn't have enough of a a grasp on the language to say anything that can be taken seriously. And to think KMFDM were at one time my favourite band. SHUDDER TO THINK."
2,KMFDM -wwIII review,Give it up people!!!!!!!!KMFDM's last great Album was ANGST and their last decent album was the one following it called NIHIL....that's all folk's
1,Craptastic,"I just got done listening to the free MP3 of WWIII. That is one of the worst songs I have ever heard. KMFDM died after Adios, Attak was horrible. What the hell happend, you guys suck."
2,This is crap compared to what they have put out before.,I like new music and such but I don't care for Pres. bashing songs throughout the whole damn CD. I do not care for Rep. or Dem. but whats the point of bashing any Pres. throughout whole damn CD...I seriously want my money back because I only like about 5 songs of this CD and normally I dig the whole thing. I can hear the media bash the Prez everyday why do I want to hear it in almost every song from a band I use to like...If your going to be political band talk about everything not just our Prez.
1,Dreadful,"Karl Marx, you have terrible taste, look the 1 album you do like and everyone else hates it, look at the other reviews for this. KMFDM are a mediocre industrial band, System of a Down could teach these guys a thing or 2 about how to write a decent song."
1,Retrospective,"I grew up on KMFDM, own every album (including the original Naive), and am skeptical about a few reviewers' distinctions between ""good KMFDM"" and ""bad KMFDM."" The only album of any real merit was What Do You Know, Deutschland? They produced a few cheesy but fun records afterwards (More & Faster + a few tracks on Money come to mind), but nothing ""good"" in any normal sense of the word. Moreover, everything since Symbols has been garbage. Two words, guys: Spinal Tap."
1,No Tim Skold = No KMFDM,"I seem to be the only one with this opinion, but I believe that Tim Skold was the best thing to ever happen to KMFDM, bringing haunting electronic sensations, powerful lyrics, and beautiful vocals. Now that he's gone, the band has gone back to the boring and lifeless music and lame lyrics it was prior to the Symbols album. And for god's sake, can this album be any more political? I have no problem with political bands, and I know that KMFDM is strongly against the war in Iraq, but I don't need to have their political beliefs blatantly shoved down my throat with every song. At least their previous albums were more subtle. Bottom line, if you think KFMDM sounded better prior to Symbols, WWIII is for you, but if you're like me and think Symbols, Adios, and Attak are their best work, steer clear of this album."
4,WWIII is HEAVY!,"Once again, the masters of industrial mayhem have done it again. If you thought ATTAK was heavy, WWIII is heavier and then some! Whereas ATTAK had some songs that were more electronic than rock, WWIII, in many respects is more rock than electronic. WWIII continues along the lines of ATTAK, only with more aggression and focus. Plus, the majority of songs are sung either by Raymond Watts (a.k.a Pig) or Lucia. Sascha (the mastermind behind KMFDM) sings on the last song ""Intro"" (really funny I might add). All the current members share songwriting duties as well. It appears that KMFDM has continued to thrive without En Esch and Gunter Schulz (original members, don't get me wrong, they were essential to the band at one time). With WWIII, KMFDM are definitely headed in the right direction with their new sound. KMFDM are definitely not fading from the music scene anytime soon. MUCHO respect to these guys!"
2,Useless if you got Verizon phone,"Pictures, ringtones, and all the other features except for the address book does not work."
5,Samsung A920 A620,"I used it to transfer my phonebook from my old SPH-A620 to my new SPH-A920. The technician at the sprint store was not able to do it, so I did a few searches and found datapilot."
1,Software Compatibilty Woes Mar Nice Tool,"If you have ANY chance of upgrading to Windows Vista, you will want to avoid this product like the plague. APC seems to be unwilling to put pressure on SoftEx to come out with a Windows Vista version of the biopod's software. If you are sure you will use Windows XP forever, then at least don't pay full price for this, like I foolishly did."
1,too old,I say don't buy unless you have a really old computer. i bought one and went to update the software for my window 7 computer. i found out that APC discontinued support for this in 2009. so if your computer is still running windows xp or earlier then its okay.
1,Unable to use,The CD with the software on it was very confusing. I tried each folder with no success. I was unable to make this product work. I used a Windows XP operating system on my desktop.
1,Bad Drivers,"Worst driver support I've seen. they force you to buy the software updates for new operating systems to make this stupid thing work. Should be free after you buy the device!Buy one from microsoft, they will atleast support their device"
3,APC Fingerprint reader,"I found that when my finger was cold it wouldn't work as well. It also took several tries to get a green print. Especially, the older it got, the longer it took to get the green print. Now it has finally died. I loved it, except for these problems! It's really nice to have an item like this. I'm going to look for a different brand this time."
1,does not work with Vista,"As others have noted, this is a nice piece of hardware. . . except that the company STILL hasn't released a driver for Microsoft Vista. I'd been using it for years with XP and was very pleased, but it became worthless when I bought a new computer. If the company isn't committed enough to the product to release current drivers when necessary, why would anyone buy it? Note that the comparable fingerprint reader from Microsoft is about the same price."
4,Finally this works wih VISTA...,You will have to contact APC at 1-800-800-4272 they will send a link to download BETA software that does work with Vista. Mine is installed and working again. YEAH!!!
1,Problems using this with Windows XP,"Installed fine, rebooted, enrolled new user's fingerprints fine, worked after hibernation fine, failed after first restart. Device manager reported a failed device driver. Attempted to uninstall, reinstall device driver. No dice. Have reinstalled twice more, again works fine until system restarts.No support from APC and could not find drivers at Softexinc. Advise you to pass on this device."
1,Fingerprint reader.,"This worked fine in windows XP, as long as you didn't try to register more than one login or more than one finger. After that it would go out of control and not let you login except randomly with the first finger registered. No drivers for win7-don't waste your time."
5,Great Product,Great service. The APC Biopod Biometric Password Manager was exactly what I wanted.Arrived sooner than expected.
3,How to use with Firefox.,"While it's true that the software packaged with the device is only compatible with Internet Explorer, there is a way to make it work with Firefox (sort of). Simply download the Firefox extension called IE Tab. This extension allows Firefox to open websites of your choosing with Internet Explorer. The beauty is that it opens these sites within a Firefox tab so it's barely noticeable that IE is being used. Unless you want to fork over the extra money for Omnipass 4.0, I think this is the best solution for Firefox users."
2,APC BIPOD,"I've used this for about 3 months. At first, it seemed to work fine except for secure sites which it did not recognize at all. Then suddenly after 2 weeks of use, it failed to recognize my print. That corresponded to a software upgrade. I had to reinstall the device. Again it worked fine except for secure sites but after a sofware upgrade, I was again locked out and had to install the software again. Just today (7 May 06) another software upgrade killed its recognition capabilities. I'm tossing it out! Only can recommend it if you do not want software upgrades. It is the omnipass software which is the problem!"
2,It goes part of the way,"I was hoping to have a solution that lets me just log in with a single fingerprint. This was not the solution.The APC biopod as fingerprint reader hardware seemed to be solid, however the Omnipass software that it was bundled with to manage login and authentication was just lacking. In order to log in, it was still required to perform the Windows ctrl-alt-del, and punch in the username. There was no way to configure the whole login process to be driven by just my fingerprint.Attempting to find out from APC tech support how to configure it left me frustrated at the lack of response. I had to directly contact Softex (makers of the Omnipass software) several times to clarify the requirements, only to be told that logging in directly with just a fingerprint couldn't be done.If that's what you want, go get the Silex fingerprint reader, or maybe the IBM fingerprint reader. Both of which will let you log right in without having to do the ctrl-alt-delete."
3,"XP great, Vista a-no-go","This product does what it says; it has been around for a while and works flawlessly on XP, yet Microsoft nor APC have made any advances in releasing a Vista driver. If you are planning on using for XP, it's a good cost efficient biometric reader, yet if you plan on upgrading to Vista anytime soon, might as well never consider this one."
2,"Hardware ok, lousy software, no Firefox support",I recently installed the PC card version of this finger print reader in my laptop. Install went smoothly. It takes some getting used to getting your finger on the sensor the right way. The software is a resource hog and prone to random crashing. But what irritated me most of all that I found out the hard way that the only browser supported is microsoft intercrap explorer. If this software would support firefox I would have given it 4 stars. Lousy techsupport. Good hardware killed by software that is plain BAD. NOT recommended.
2,"Hardware OK, Software flakey","I bought two of these a while ago. While the hardware seems to work o.k, the software is a memory hog, and stops working repeatedly in both PCs. Support information on the APC site for the software is sparse, and the Softex website (the company who provides the software) hasn't been updated for a few years.Also, we experience many false negatives (failure to recognize a registered finger) for the younger users in my home. I plan on trying the Microsoft reader next. The sensor is made by a different company (digitalpersona vs authentec for the APC), and I understand that it uses a different technology. It also seems to be better supported by Microsoft."
2,"Great Idea, but not for Windows 2000","This thing is a terrific idea, but I can't get past the enrollment set-up where it asks for my current Windows password. I'm using Windows 2000 on my Dell desktop and had several contacts with their tech support. A nice guy made suggestions, but the enrollment procedure still gives me an error message saying it doesn't recognize my Windows password or user name. I want my $50 back."
3,"Good lighting, but pull-chain for fan does not operate smoothly","I got this light kit because it was recommended for the Hunter fan that I bought. I am not crazy about the style, but the lighting is very good. I am not happy with the way the pull-chain for the fan comes through this small hole in the glass dome. You have to pull it at a specific angle, and very carefully, or it may catch on the side and not pull properly. The whole light fixture moves considerably when you pull on the chain, but I guess that's normal.Hunter is a very reputable company and I am very pleased with their customer relations department. I'm not sure whether my first electrician botched up the installation or whether the light kit was defective, but Hunter was quick to send me a replacement light kit. The light was flickering and the fixture was not hanging straight. It looked like it was tilted. It was much better the second time it was installed by a different electrician!"
2,Poorly done.,"Pinsky's writing is average, and covers a broad range of topics, however few are done in any serious detail.Perhaps the most glaring problem with this book though, are the typographical errors. They are spread liberally through its pages, and this is unacceptable for a third edition. I think a mathematician such a Pinsky would be able to catch the fact that some of his examples involve variables that were never introduced, variables over which a sum is performed outside summation indicies, and just many plain mistakes. The problems at the end of a section are the worst, though, and there are glaring and frequent errors here.It's impossible to learn from a book that you cannot trust, and if I were you, I would save my 80-90 dollars and spend it somewhere else."
1,not a good book for physicists,"THIS BOOK HAS NUMEROUS ERRORS IN THE EXAMPLES. THE PROFESSOR AND SOME STUDENTS HAVE SOLVED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE BOOK AND FOUND THAT THE CORRESPONDING ANSWER IN THE BACK IS INCORRECT. THE BOOK DOES A POOR JOB OF TEACHING THE FOURIER SERIES. WE HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE END OF THE SECOND CHAPTER AND I USE OTHER BOOKS CHECKED OUT FROM THE LIBRARY AS HELP. I WOULD THINK THAT NOT EVEN A FIRST EDITION BOOK WOULD HAVE THIS MANY ERRORS. ALSO THE PROOFS ARE WEAK. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TEXT, AND IF YOU LIKE ME USE THIS BOOK FOR A CLASS, FIND SUPPLEMATARY TEXTS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THIS ONE"
2,"Wonderful art, but the cardstock is awful","Oh, if only a different publisher had put out this deck... If it were a US Games or Lo Scarabeo deck, I could have rated it more highly. I do love the artwork on this deck, but the cardstock is so heavy it makes the deck impossible to shuffle, unless you have a large space and can do the mixing on your tabletop. St Martin's Press has put out some nice decks... this one is not their best effort."
5,Enchanted and enlightening!,"I use this book and card set at all times,especially when I am reading others. The cards seem to have a very strong spiritual base and I like the fact that they help the reader to concentrate on there inner strength for guidance."
3,"Uniquely Designed, but Not For Me","I found the accompanying book to be excellent; however, I was quite put off by the look of the deck itself, and I will only work with decks that have art work that I feel really drawn to. While Amy Zerner's gorgeous tapestries work beautifully with the ""Oracle of the Goddess"" deck and book, which I also own, I felt the collages of fabric images with the ""paste book"" look too overbearing for me to effectively use. The cards are large, with a very frilly, lacy Victorian look to them, like old Victorian valentines; I know that many people who own this book and card set love it, so this is just my opinion. I would not discourage anyone from purchasing this item, but just be prepared. If you are a male, it is not likely that you'll be comfortable with this deck."
2,Could have been a 5 ... but the card stock quality is poor,"The tarot itself is fine. The other reviews already testify to that. The book is a beautiful hard cover book... but what happened in the card stock department? I was disapointed for a number of reasons. The deck comes in three wrapped parts, no box. Once the deck is unwrapped the beautiful box the book and cards came in is no longer usable (the ends are gluded shut - once opened it's a throw-away). There is no box for the deck itself. The card stock is of lower quality than most other decks (e.g., I had to use an x-acto knife to finish triming the corners of two cards). Also, the cards are not all uniform in size. If the card stock had been what we are used to... this deck would have been better. Instead it's falls short of average."
1,Disappointing,"Admittedly I am a novice, and as such I found the cards themselves to blend one into the other with few distinguishing characteristics. The endless fabric collage themes overwhelmed rather than enhance what should have been salient features of each card. The cards were not even of uniform size, some being a tad shorter than others. The book must be targeted for more advanced users as it gives the novice little insight into the scope of possibilities for each card. The beginner would do far better acquiring a book by Louis or Bunning."
2,Order not complete,I did not receive the cards only the book. Is there any way we can fix this?Thanks !
3,OK deck,"While the tapestries are somewhat pretty, the cards are just so busy that it takes away form really interpreting them and getting a good reading."
1,Uninteresting,"I found this Tarot deck to be uninteresting and uninspiring. The artistry was pale and generally, the item did not invite use of the intuition."
3,Only one drawback to this deck...,"the cards are simply too large to work with easily. There's another version by the same creators in a slightly smaller size; I believe Amazon carries those as well. If you plan to use this deck to any extent, I'd really recommend the smaller size."
5,"The best, most beautiful, and gentle tarot in the world!","Amy Zerner is an incredible artist, one of the leading collage artists in the world. She won a National Endowment for the Arts award in the category of Painting, not crafts, for her fabric callages, the only artist in the history of the NEA to do so. Like Salvator Dali, she designed her own tarot deck and you can see by the majority of reviews here that agree with me, this is a most special tarot and one that every tarot reader, student or expert, should own. It is gorgeous and sophisticated and simple all at the same time. And the book is wonderful. This is a tarot book and card set for beginners and intermediate level readers, alike. There's something in it for everyone. Enjoy!"
5,Gorgeous and User-Friendly Tarot Deck,"The Enchanted Tarot is my main deck out of the dozens I now own, and it's because the symbols are both so immediately accessible and attractive to anyone I read for, plus the images are so tactile/sensual as they are made from fabric collages. None of these cards seem ""scary"" to the novice, and all offer hours of fun when you study them in depth...they are subtle, sensitive, but in keeping with traditional symbolism. The cards handle well and the descriptions and meanings given are beautifully written. I particularly like the way the book is formatted with the storyline, interpretative meaning and then the ""enchantment"" at the end - which is like a cross between a spell and an affirmation, useful to the reader to ingrain the feeling tone and positive message of the cards. I would recommend this deck to both the experienced tarot reader and to the novice, which speaks for itself. A must-have in any collection."
4,Beautiful Pictures!,"I've had this deck for many years and am happy to find it's still available. The book included is not a fantastic book. There are many more books available that give greater insights into the tarot. However, it's my belief that if one is drawn to the pictures in the cards then they should have that deck, because the pictures are more likely to have meaning then. However, The Tarot Discovery Kit by the same people have the exact same pictures on the deck included. Granted, the deck isn't as large and the cards are flimsy--compared to the Enchanted Deck's very sturdy cards--but if one is drawn to the pictures that deck is also available. Personally, I own both and am much happier with the Enchanted Tarot Deck. But again, the book is not very good."
5,Excellent Enchanting Tarot Artwork from Farber and Zerner+,"I recently acquired this great Tarot deck and book.And it is really amazing to explore and practice with.What i don't like about the deck is the confining white border around the edges.If they cut off the borders,the deck would be more facilitative and flowing.The artwork is stunnning and magickal.It's a modern tarot deck with a heraldic grandeur and majestic splendor that brings the chivalric past into the mundane present.It's one of the best Tarot decks around today.The book is basically a good addendum,yet most information is a repeat of standard traditional tarot books,like from Arthur Waite and Eden Gray.It's another great montage and collage of Tarot images from the creative divination team of Amy Zerner and Monte Farber."
2,ENCHANTED TAROT,"Even though the book is written well, I was terribly disappointed with Amy Zerner's fabric collage tapestry design. Amy has got colors and elements all mismatched. Some of the cards are confusing to intrepret. It seems Amy was experimenting with her design techniques. I prefer Rider Waithe cards anyday.The book is otherwise written well, but the readings are very brief and may not suffice for a novice. I wish there were some more effort put into describing the dream and the awakening.I hope in the next edition Amy sticks to the traditional tarot card designs."
1,Falsely advertised,"I orThe Enchanted Tarot: Book and Cardsdered this product because it said book and cards. I already had the book but needed the cards, but for the price it was worth getting the second copy of book.(I thought). BUT, when it arrived it was only the book with no cards, even the the original listing was for book and cards. No mention was made that the cards were not available. I returned it and was VERY disappointed that I had wasted money not only on a product I did not want or need, but also had to pay for two shippings."
3,tarot book of enchanted,nice for beginners but not for me i like orisa tarots cards these are different but they help new comers
1,The Book Arrived but not the tarot cards as advertised,"I ordered the Enchanted Tarot with the full understanding that the cards would come with the books. As advertised ""The Enchanted Tarot: Book and CARDS. But no cards were with the shipment. I expect the cards to be shipped to me. I expect Amazon to assist me in this matter. What good does the book do me without the cards? When can I expect the cards to be shipped? My name is James Prichard my email is jprichard32@gmail.comIt is mandatory that I hear something from you. I paid for the cards and I expect to receive them.thank youJames Prichard"
5,"By far, one of the best tarot decks and tarot books around!","I've used The Enchanted Tarot since it first came out in 1990 and I have never found it necessary to use another deck. I have been reading professionally for twenty years and my clients, since I started using it, always comment on how beautiful the cards are. Before I used The Enchanted Tarot, they never commented on my other decks. The fabric collage tapestries of Amy Zerner are beyond beautiful and have a multi-cultural quality unlike anything I have ever seen. Almost all the other tarot decks I've seen are dark and spooky, or so amateurish as to be laughable. Those are the kind of decks that give tarot a bad name. The Enchanted Tarot is gentle and healing and I've gone through two sets myself and given many, many sets away as gifts. The Enchanted Tarot is what the tarot can and should be: beautiful, powerful, and accurate. Buy it, you won't be sorry!"
4,"Good, but Step Down from Firestorm 2","The company does good work. The pad is durable and sufficient for normal use. I can say from experience that you won't be disappointed with a controller from this company, they do good work and the prices are usually quite reasonable.However, I'm saddened no end that they took such a step back from theFireStorm Digital 2gamepad. That was the greatest gamepad I've ever owned if only because it had 8 buttons across the front in addition to the shoulder ones. It looked like a Sega Genesis controller, not a PS2 one.Anyway, good controller so if you're into emulated games which are becoming more and more availalbe from online sellers or if it's legal in your area to download ROMs off the Internet if you own the physical cartridge, then this is a good option. If you're looking for something that'll play the latest games, you'll probably want to spring for a higher end one that has analog sticks."
5,Excellent material with reservations...,"The study material that is available to a person with interest into the nuance of Kabbalah is worth the price of the book, you will find some nuggets within.The introduction is by Rabbi Lawrence Kushner (who wrote a classic on the Hebrew Letters.)Just be careful, remember: The future is a dream an emotion, our present is what we need to deal with properly!.. Then, we won't have to worry about the future."
5,THE BEST BOOK,The bark thirty is a good book I love the book. I give the book 5 stars because it is the best book I ever read. It is about 7 story's and it is old history story's of real people. I hope you like it to.
5,Still Excellent,"This was one of my favorite books as a child, and continues to be to this day. The lessons it teaches are wrapped in tales so entertaining I latched on to it for my entire life, despite my usual distaste for the genres associated with ""Ghost Stories"" or ""Folk Tales."" Finding it again here just reminded me of how much I loved it, and it will be added to the list of books to read to my children, in time."
5,Excellent for either middle school readers or parental read-alouds,Excellent for either middle school readers or parental read-alouds with the family is a chilling gathering of supernatural folk stories in THE DARK-THIRTY: SOUTHERN TALES OF THE SUPERNATURAL. Black and white drawings by Brian Pinkney compliments a collection which offers tales inspired by African American history from slavery to 20th century time frames.
2,Is this how digital TV is supposed to look?,"I purchased this antenna a few months ago and have been very unimpressed. When the picture comes in, it's awesome. The problem is that it's very hit and miss. Some channels (all local) are better than others but they all have periodic glitches in the picture.This is my first digital antenna so I don't have any other product to compare it with, but if this is what digital TV is all about, count me out. I'd rather see my entire show/game in analog than miss plays because of the random and excessive glitches. Very, very frustrating."
3,Works fine,This antenna brings in about 17 channels free from where I live. You do have to get up and adjust the antenna from time to time to bring in a channel when you change channels. Otherwise it works fine. The picture is excellent on our HDTV television.
2,1 channel,"I live in a suburban area and this device gives me one channel. When I can pick up the channe, it is a nice picture.May not be for everyone."
2,good case ... bad belt clip,the belt clip -plastic- broke in less than 3 months. Otherwise this would have been my best case. Size is bulky though but i didn't mind it for the good protection.
4,Good ole older Del,"If it's traditional bluegrass you be wanting then you've come to the right CD. Del is in fine voice here. I prefer the more ""modern"" songwriting of Cold Hard Facts or The Family, but this one is good too. Best song: High on a Mountain."
3,Great Hit Single/Lousy Album,"The Flirtations' lone US hit, ""Nothing But a Heartache"" is the best song The Supremes never recorded - in fact, it's better than anything The Supremes or other ""girl groups"" recorded! I have long wanted to get a copy of the song on CD, and was excited to see that their long out-of-print ""Sounds Like"" album was available on disc. Though it was worth buying for ""Heartache"", the rest of the tunes I found to be poorly written and poorly recorded take-offs of the Motown sound. If these ladies had found better songwriters, they might have had a few more hits. They also could have used better album-cover designers! Nonetheless, they had one great moment in music history and this CD, for better or worse, is the best place to find that moment."
1,Are you Serious,"""Let us wash our hands of their blood."" (Speaking of priests and nuns) Spoken by Martin Luther. Glad I don't follow him. His teachings are fundamentally wrong and mainly from trying to ease his soul and fears."
4,A Devotional Gem,"While not the most complex and challenging of devotional materials and while it uses a Scripture translation not among my favorites, the book combines the vitality of the Reformer and the ability of the translator to provide a series of brief yet compelling devotional reflections. This Luther speaks kindly and directly to heart and soul."
2,Nice typeface,"I like the typeface that the publisher uses here, but beyond that, there is little good I can say about this book. It's boring. The author does little to intergrate her discussions of different aspects of the geography of Mexico. It's just like, Here are the Pyramids...Bam! Here are some folk dancers.And then there's this little piece of propaganda...""...the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement made it easier and less expensive for Mexico to trade goods with its North American neighbors.""No discussion beyond that. then bam! on to Fiestas, Music, and Arts!"
5,I love this book!,"This book is one of those ""useless facts"" books, but the useless things are so interesting and unlike other ""useless facts"" books, it actually held my attention because the things they talk about are interesting and relevant."
2,The white is not WHITE!,The runner is very high quality. I ordered in the white but it is not white. It is an off white/cream color. I am disappointed it is not white because it is very nice and worth the money.

2,couldn't grasp,"I couldn't grasp this, math and visualization is hard for me. I guess I was hoping for a book that helps you know where you are, and how to get somewhere else without a gps. After reading the book, I still don't know if you can use a sextant to find your latitude and longitude, why would I care about the G.P. if I want to find Greenland? He states there is a long mathamatical formula for finding the distance between 2 points on the earth, after reading about G.P's, DR's,LOP's I wished he would have talked about it instead. the story about Eratosthenes was great, that was about all I got out of the book."
2,Legs too short,"These briefs are very comfortable but the legs are too short. This causes your ""junk"" to hang out. I bought eight pair and returned seven of them. The mid-thigh brief is much better and I ordered ten pair. They are wonderful."
2,No room for junk,"While the cloth is very comfortable, these seem like girls' briefs... There's no room for your, ahem, junk, and so it all sort of eventually just falls out the leg. You'll be visiting the bathroom to readjust constantly if you're of normal or bigger junk size, no matter what size brief you choose.In boxers this would be acceptable, but with boxer briefs there are strangulation issues.Me, I can't wear them in any size."
3,Nice But.....,I read the reviews and went with these boxer briefs for Christmas for my husband. He is a solid 34 waist and all of the underwear I have ever bought him has been a size Large with no problems. These he said tend to ride up and after a while things can shift out. Our experience.....go up a size. Even when you unwrap them they are small looking.
3,It's OK,"While the cloth is very comfortable, these seem like girls' briefs... There's no room for your,junk, and so it all sort of eventually just falls out the leg. You'll be visiting the bathroom to readjust constantly if you're of normal or bigger junk size."
3,disappointed,I washed them once and the stitching came ondone. I didn't particular like the comfort either.
5,Delightful Intra-Species Territory,"The Daisy Sutra suprised me in its exploration of human-dog relations. I was touched by the humor, pathos and finally metaphysical reach of this little gem. I have bought 5 for gifts. Deep, rich, rewarding read."
5,FABULOUS,"A wonderful, well-written book for any dog lover who knows that we really CAN communicate with our animals ... and they with us, but ONLY IF WE LISTEN."
2,Not an easy read,"This book was recommended to me as the bible of active management. I attempted reading it several times, but gave up everytime. Coming from a science and engineering background, I find the exposition very verbose, yet lacking a ground-up derive-from-fundamentals approach. Even in the description of CAPM, I cannot tell the assumptions from the conclusions of the theory. The book is not an easy read, but I don't think that's because the subject is inherently hard."
2,Very boring and dry,"This book is a funny phenomenon in itself: it seems that every portfolio manager keeps a copy on her desk, but nobody I've talked to likes the book, or has even really read it. I read it and had to struggle hard to go from one page to the next. It's one of the WORST books I've ever read in any field. The book attempts to give the reader a comprehensive overview of the portfolio management discipline. Unfortunately, it's extremely dry, to the point of boring the reader to death. A lot of pages are also wasted on topics of dubious value, while important subjects like global management is treated lightly. I highly recommend against this book. It's a waste of money."
3,kindle version dont have a TOC,My first impression of the kindle version is negative because it doesn't have a indexed table of contents . The rest of the book seems fine for a quantitative aproach active portfolio management book.
2,Watchable but barely,"First of all, fans of Vincent Price should be aware that he is not in ""Chamber of Horrors""--nor are Richard Long or Carolyn Craig for that matter. Nor was the film produced in 1958--from the look of it, probably early to mid 1930's. The film is a fairly tedious bit of melodrama. The transfer is awful--fuzzy picture and the sound is so bad the dialogue is hard to make out. ""Bluebeard"" is the better of the two with John Carradine's restrained performance the reason for giving the dvd two stars. The picture isn't terrible clear, but the sound is okay. So, for five dollars I would give this one a look if you like John Carradine, but skip over ""Chamber of Horrors""."
4,A Solid Kung Fu Gem,"I bought this movie mainly because of its stars Lo Leih and Hwang Jang-Lee who are in my opinion the greatest villians in classic kungfu cinema. The story is ok as Tu Ta-Shin(Chen Sing) plays the lead role and Hwang Jang-Lee(Nan Pa-Ting) plays the main villian. Tu Ta-Shin is actually a anti-hero as he ""kills"" the young boy's father in the beginning and takes the boy with him, only to train him allowing him to challenge him at any time. He does however grant the fathers last wish to kill the traitor Nan Pa-Ting. It has nice choreographed action scenes and the story is fairly easy to follow. I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars because though its is good, the lead villians have had better roles,(see Born Invincible for Lo Leih and Hells Windstaff for Hwang Jang-Lee) and I also thought the little kids role was almost not even necessary for the story. If you like old school kungfu it is a must see."
3,very good!,"Dvd plays how it's suppose to! There are no technical screw-ups,nothing! the picture is as good as it's gonna get! There are some graininess, some white crap you usually see in any low budget kung fu flick but it isn'y really that bad! The movie itself is pretty good! It's got really well choregraphed kung fu in which Yuen Biao and Cory Yuen are responsible for! And some weird characters! The story is the typical revenge, I must challenge you to become popular type! So product is a 7/10the movie is 3 stars or if you perfer 6/10!"
2,"The Figure is good, nicely done but...","I bought this second handed, it arrived bended and broken, also some parts where missing. The model is good but i would recommend buying it new."
4,Series 4 Water Dragon,"Here's my review for the Series 4 Water Dragon from McFarlane. This dragon is in more of a bipedal pose, something a bit ungainly for a water dragon (at least, to me). The base is nice and well-constructed, but I had to really stretch my dragon's legs to fit him on his base, which was difficult, seeing as how he is very sharp. Still, the detail is superb. Overall, a B+."
2,Good material but poor qauality of manufacturing,"A good telling of the story, but some parts maybe above the heads of 8-10 year olds. This is interesting for anyone interested in this topic or shipwrecks in general. However, ths DVD was really expensive, and, it turns out, poorly manufactured, unfortunately."
3,They don't teach history like they should.,"I enjoy historical fiction immenseley, but I am giving this book three stars.It is a very interesting book- Nicole gets what she wants- almost. As the protagonist she is a very shallow character. The other characters seem as narrow and almost cookie cutter. The life of drugery was accurate; her experiences were very accurate although we only had small glimpses into the neighbors lives and interactions. This would have been better if we could have seen more of the city and its workings.A few trips to the baths and the market was not enough.I would have liked closure with Umma. She had a lot to catch up on when she returned. There were just too many loose ends.A better read is Down the Common although this is not fantasy.a"
5,wonderful summer reading,"I heard about this book from reading the reviews on Amazon.com. I loved the book! It was a wonderful summer read. Wouldn't it be interesting to know what happened when Umma woke up and couldn't read, didn't have any more exciting new cooking ideas and found out her child and lover had died of disease?"
2,"Great concept, vivid detail, but falls flat","I read this book because its concept sounded promising: 20th-century American feminist travels to 2nd-century Rome (the frontier town Carnuntum) and learns a thing or two about real life. Unfortunately, our heroine, Nicole, learns little more than any fool could have told her: that life is a lot easier now than it was then, especially for selfish, self-righteous feminists. The book misses every opportunity to explore the facile assumptions of post-modern ethics. Christians are likened to modern terrorists. Men, with few exceptions, are pigs. Nicole herself is above reproach, even though she shows not the slightest remorse when abandoning her children in either century. She starts and ends as a spiteful witch, always blaming somebody else for her troubles."
3,Nicoles attitude.,"Generally, I enjoyed the book but I was turned off by Nicole's lack of basic knowledge of the 2nd century. I found it hard to believe that a well-educated woman such as Nicole did not realize that women's rights were non-existant during this era as anyone with even the most elementary knowledge of ancient Rome knows. Even more incredible was her belief that ancient Rome was some sort of Utopia. In spite of this, I was fascinated to read how people actually then."
2,The rewards of ignorance,"Inagine, if you will, a protagonist with all the pesonal warmth of a Hillary and the erudition of a George Dubya Bush... Well, what you get is the preposterous 'heroine' of this novel: totally unsympathetic, snobbish, sexist, racist, opinionated, incredibly ignorant (I mean, not studying history at school, I could understand, but how likely is it that the protagonist has never even seen a movie or read a trashy novel about ancient Rome? - if she had, she could never, ever for amoment thought that it could be a society with more equality for women - for God sake, she is supposed to be a brilliant lawyer... has she never heard of 'patria potestas?). If she had been the villain of the piece, I could have liked the novel, for other characters are nicely drawn, and the backgroung feels very realistic (the 'deus ex machina' use of the household gods notwithstanding)."
5,Household Gods,"The main character's animosity toward men wore me out. The beginning dragged with too many meaningless details. Once she found herself in Carnuntum, however, the book captivated me and didn't release me until the end. A sequel would be welcomed, particularly if the authors managed to start it better than they did this one."
3,"Amusing, but at least one factual error","I kept describing Nicole/Umma's difficulties in adapting to life 1800 years ago to my husband and children, a sign that the story was compelling.But as other reviewers have stated, the protagonist was unbelievably dense. Her interior dialogues made for some awfully clunky writing.The most fascinating thing that I learned was that it takes 20 minutes to get from West Hills to the Getty Museum. Going to the new Getty, that might be possible--at 2 AM. To the old Getty, where one can actually see the ancient statuary described in the book, you'd need far longer. Can't help but make me wonder what other glitches got by, and what kind of cars the authors drive."
3,Good for Light Reading,"Pretty good light reading. Don't expect it to give you a robust historical perspective of Roman times. Very focussed on what life would have been like to the individual and the life you will see is limited to what that individual sees and hears. It is an interesting perspective. Clearly, the author is comparing women with the same lifestyle in two different time periods.There is an emphasis on the fact the heroine is a lawyer and how she uses her lawyer skills. I did find the lawyer aspect a little unrealistic and got slightly sick of hearing about it. I also found it difficult to feel any empathy for the characters. I think that is because the heroine didn't express much empathy, either.I give this 3 stars because the story was enjoyable, especially towards the beginning of the book, but I did get bored towards the end and found it difficult to maintain the desire to finish it."
3,A good book with some faults,"As far as history is concerned the book is worth all 508 pages of it. It is a good and acurate reconstruction of 150 a.d. in the Roman Empire. The main character, on the other hand, is your typical bourgeois liberal, who must push her own limited ideas on all those around her; all for the provincialistic view that she holds that what she knows must be the best. It is really irritating to see her character develop in this novel; as you come to realize how little originality in thought she holds. All her liberal ideas she repeats fanatically and dares to impose them oa all those around her. She is more like a photocopy of many of many other bourgeois types, than an individual with too much intelligence.André Janssens"
4,Good Read,"I thought Household Gods was an interesting and unique book. If you're considering reading it for a book report, I would suggest to just read it for kicks. It is rather hard to sum up into a short paper. There is sex, violence, etc, but it is nothing like a romance novel or war book. It is informative while maintaining the curiosity of the reader. It also has a positive ending, so it won't leave you depressed or crying. (yay for that)"
4,A PAGE TURNER,"I read this book in only two days... It is truly engrossing. The protagonist needs a good smacking, like most of us. She has never paused to examine her own values as the souce of her own discontent, but has rather wandered through life with a ""grass is always greener somewhere else"" sort of feeling, the feeling that this next acomplishment will give you nirvana. She finds that life, health and the company of others are instead the true path to happiness."
1,Save your money,"Those who have read Tarr's other books know that, regardless of the setting, she tends to write the SAME book over and over again: the same noble characters, the same haunting beauty, the same touch of magic. Household Gods introduces us to a new type of character, a small-minded woman, consumed by petty cares. Nicole Gunther-Perrin is an unflattering caricature of the ""modern woman"" whose knee-jerk liberalism and feminism do little to mask her inherent racism and classism. (Nicole wears ""designer sweats"" from Neiman Marcus and cannot fathom why her Mexican babysitter would rather take care of her own sick mother than watch Nicole's kids). I kept hoping that her trip to ancient Rome would cure her of some of these defects, but Nicole is such an unappealing character that I found it almost impossible to care. Does Nicole learn a lesson by the end of the book? Who knows? Household Gods is an unreadable waste of time."
4,"Slow start, but an interesting and enjoyable story","This is basically a coming-of-age novel, even though its main character is already of adult years. But despite her age, she's basically a spoiled child: self-centered, judgmental, irresponsible, and largely ignorant of the world. This has one major flaw: she's so damned unlikeable that I found it hared to really get into the book for the first couple of hundred pages. Perhaps the authors were a bit heavy handed in their portrayal, though I've certainly known women lawyers like this character. At any rate, as she begins to learn from her experiences, and as new characters are introduced, the story gets steadily better. I enjoyed it, and was sorry when it was over."
5,Household Gods,I haven't enjoyed a story this much in quit a long time. The only slight fault I find with the book is the protagonists over reaction to each new experience she encounters in her new surroundings.Read it and Enjoy a great story.
3,Entertaining Read,"I agree with other reviewers that the main character was a bit unlikable and a bit deluded about history. When I read her musings about life during the Roman Empire being free from patriarchy, I had to laugh. The book does draw you in, however...mostly due to the convincing web of day-to-day details about life during that time. Although I didn't feel most of the characters were very well-drawn, the book is a great way to waste a couple of hours."
2,Just too much whining and cultural ignorance,"Unlike several other reviewers for this book, I couldn't get past the protagonist's (ha!) self-centeredness and general unlikability to enjoy the story behind her. If she had been given at least one redeeming quality at the outset, I might have been able to stomach the rest of her ignorance, lack of empathy, and completely overbearing attitude.I will admit that the story itself was a good one -- the book came highly recommended to me, and even with the caveat that I had to make it past the first three chapters with my ground-teeth intact, I was interested. It was a shame to me that the main characters modern attitudes came wrapped in a 'my way or the highway' box."
1,Common Knowledge,"Well, I bought the book on spec. I thought that idea of waking up in 2nd centrey AD would make me feel like I was there. No such luck. Most of the material is the protagonist complainly if not outwardly, inwardly. Give me a break. As a book of historical fiction, it very light on the history."
1,Try to get through the first 50 pages...,"I couldn't get through the first 50 pages, rooked into a purchase by the name of Harry Turtledove on the cover.I like Turtledove's treatment of alternative history and thought ""this is a convenient way to try another author I don't know. If she is associated with an author I like, all the better.""I read the beginnings of this book, and I soon was hoping it would improve. I never got past the first awful day in the life of the principle character. It was the cartoonish and misandrist depictions of men that clued me in. I was overwhelmed by the gender-conscious, race-conscious, bitter, and mean-spiritness of the protagonist.I put down the book when ""patriarchy"" first surfaced.If you value these references in your fictional writing, by all means, buy this book.I think all the above poisoned a theme and story of potential."
5,Ghost leeds children into pond,"The book Wait till Helen Comes by Mary Downing Hahn is about two single parents that get married and their children don't like each other. They move into a church which is by a graveyard , and one of the sisters finds a grave in the graveyard that is hidden by a tree. And the ghost of the grave comes out and was her friend , but since the girl didn't like her new brother and sister the ghost doesn't like them either. Then the girl tell the ghost to haunt her brothers and sister's room. The book is very good you should read it."
4,"""The Ghost""","""Wait Till Helen Comes"" is a good book for 10 thourgh 14 year olds. It is a science fiction book that is easy to follow. It keeps your attention and makes you want to keep reading. It's suspensful and entertaining.In the book Helen is a ghost and she is looking for her parents. She haunts a young girl until she finds her parents. It is a typical science fiction book that takes you to a haunted house, a church, a graveyard and a pond.I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to my friends if they are looking for a mysterious book. I would give it four stars."
4,A Ghost Story,"What I think of the book ""Wait Till Helen Comes"" is suspensful and very interesting. They talk about families and step children and how they conflict with each other. The reason they conflict with each other so much is because the daughter of the man has bottled up a deep dark secret and is making her angry. The little girl finds a ghost that she can talk to. She tells the ghost lies and all the horrible stuff her family does to her. What she didn't know was that the ghost is planning something terrible. I would recommend this book to ages 8 and up because it has scary moments. I LOVE THIS BOOK!"
5,The Greatest Book!,"""Wait Till Helen Comes"" is an oustanding book. Mary Downing Hahn is a super author. She uses great description. When I first looked at the front cover of the book, I did not think that I was going to enjoy it. I was wrong though. It acturally happens to be one of me favorite novels. I totally suggest it to anyone who is interested in reading. I feel that it is appropriate for almost any age. From the second I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down. I was extremely anxious to read on. There was never a part that I disliked. Every chapter I loved. It had an awesome beginning, along with ending. I really enjoyed reading this book and I am sure you would too."
5,Great Stuff!,"I have been waiting years for Nazareth albums to come out on CD. They are a bit pricey but it's worth it. Nazareth is truely an over looked band. 2XS was the first Nazareth CD I purchsed. It's hard to choose, but I'd have to say 2XS is Nazareth's best album."
2,My name is earl - the album,"I did not like this or the music as well as I thought I would. There are a lot of other programs in the series w/really funny shows and fantastic music. But this one did not have what I was expecting, only approx 3 or 4 songs were really good."
3,If You Want to Get to Heaven,"Probably not quite enough good country rock, such as the sensational song from the Joy jacks delivery truck and driver episode, Ozark Mountain Daredevils ""If you want to Get to Heaven"""
4,I think Phil Harris sang Smoke That Cigarette on the tv show,"Having just watched the first season set, I don't think Sammy Davis Jr's version of ""Smoke That Cigarette"" was on the TV show itself. It sure sounded like an even older version, which was done by Phil Harris (of Jungle Book and Jack Benny's radio show) It's a minor thing, but it's a shame when they have to make substitutions on a ""soundtrack"" isn't it? JerPhil Harris - His Original & Greatest Hits"
4,Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manual,Great book but has too much generalizations. I was interrested mostly in the mazda millenia. It contains great information about some repairs but not all. I thought i could find a parts list for the car so that i can be able to know what exactly to order when needed.This is not the case.so i was disappointed. It does however cover topics such as location of fuel pump and how to replace.etc.More of a general car repair manual
4,Better get it,"If you have a mazda MX3, you better get this book. Haynes doesn't make one as far as I know. Worth the money I paid."
5,Blue Roses (hardcover) Review,"Despite what movies portray, there is no magic fairy dust to bring a loved one back once they have passed away and good books which help children understand and deal with a family member's death are extremely important. Linda Boyden's ""Blue Roses"" is a great book. After the loss of my daughter's grandfather, we used this book to help her cope with the loss of Grampa Bill. Linda's gentle yet well crafted words helped us to cry and smile and dream about our favorite grandfather. My daughter also loved Amy Cordova's simple yet, lively illustrations. This book was taken to school for ""sharing"" by my daughter who talked about her grandpa and she continues to refer to it as ""Grampa's book"". We would gladly recommend ""Blue Roses"" to everyone who has a young family member who has experienced a loss in the family."
1,Disappointed,"Luckily I did not buy this book, I borrowed it. I was very excited when I first brought this book home, but after I actually got into it I started to realize that it is full of typographical errors. At first I thought it was me, I was pulling my hair out thinking that my calculator had broke or I was just ""missing something"". Even simple multiplication was wrong. For example in an equation the book (page 78) states that ""159000 / (3.3 x 0.68)= 159000 / 206.04"" How did the author come up with 206.04??? The last time I checked my calculator, 3.3 x 0.68 = 2.244. I have been through six chapters so far and there are MANY typo's. I wonder to myself if what I am learning is actually correct or is it a typo? What about the in-depth chapters? I will continue to read this book for a very basic overview of electronics but that's about it."
2,Errors cause confusion...,"I bought this book in hopes of using it as a techincal reference to review fundamental electrical principals and theory. Unfortunatley, I was disappointed that this book had errors in the text and/ or diagrams that could lead to confusion for those who have no background in electonic theory. If the errors were corrected, it would be an OK introduction to electronics for non- techincal person. If you are looking for technical information and theory in any detail, this is not the book to buy."
2,Errors in the first edition,"I have also found errors in this book, especially in the OP-AMP section where he distinguishes an inverting OP-AMP with a noninverting OP-AMP with the same passive elements. The Gain formula, according to the book, only differs by a negative sign for the 2 circuits. This is wrong.Other then that, it does provide a good foundation for beginners understanding of electronics (conceptually)."
3,"Nice book, but...","Although this has a very easy language for beginners, the errors on the diagrams and formulas can drive any newbie crazy. I've seen minor errors a lot, like error conversions from Kilo (10^3) to Mega (10^6) very often in the book, but when I've started looking the chapter about digital gates and got the example schema in the picture ""26-7 A"" in page 379 this almost killed me, I've tried for hours to find a reason on the example, until I found they simply forgot an inverter from the terminal B to the AND gate. I hope they can release a list of errors somehow so we can actually use this book as intended."
2,errors render a potentially wonderful book merely confusing,"Several critical fundamentals are unexplained, and editing errors often pop up and terribly confuse the reader (or at least this reader)."
2,4th edition errors unacceptable,"I picked up this book as crutch to get back into electronics. I'm only 35 pages straight reading in, and can only imagine how many beginners were pulling their hair out trying to understand this through all the screwups. Some concepts are explained nicely, but when basic formulas are patently wrong, and references to figures don't match up, it makes the book worthless and unreliable. To keep a book just for the concept doesn't make sense when full of equations that you have to double check before wasting your time.And again, this is a forth edition. There is no excuse for so many obvious oversights. Its clear this publisher has NO technical proof reader, and it would seem that Mr. Horn only read this when he first wrote it, and never picked up a printed copy of his own book."
2,review of 4th edition paperback,"This book has many errors. I stumbled across them without intending to. For example, chapter 3 page 20 lists a formula to find watts as P=E*E*R, it should be P=E*E/R. In chapter 8 I found two typos, one in the formula to find the inductance of a coil page 110, another in the defining of terms on page 111. That's just a few that I can easily reference because I took the time to scribble out what was printed.The biggest problem is that these typos aren't simple misspellings; The typos are mostly found in the formulas. As a reference this book fails. A person could hurt themselves blowing up components because of these formulas. The release of this book is almost criminally negligent.It's obvious from the nature of the errors that the author has little responsiblity for them. The errors seem to arise from poor type setting of whatever type of press the publisher is using. My tip for readers is find a different book, and my tip to the author is find a different publisher."
1,Pitiful,"When I bought this book a number of years ago, I couldn't believe how riddled with typos it was. On top of that, many of the figures that are obviously hand drawn could've been drawn better by a 2 year old. Some things are just plain wrong like ""impedance angles always being 45 degrees."" A person just starting in the subject would probably give up on learning the subject because of how hard it is to follow, and how they flip back and forth between using conventional current and electron current in their analyses, w/o informing the reader when or even explaining the difference in the two ""types"" of current. I shot an email to TAB books telling them how disappointing the book was, and they sent me a electronics dictionary free."
2,Bland and uninspired music from the twenties,"I love twenties music and I really appreciate the many fine releases from The Old Masters label. Unfortunately, this is a bland and uninspired cd. The arrangements and playing are merely adequate and I found nothing I wanted to put on my ipod. Try the Hotel Biltmore Orchestra or the Six Jumping Jacks cds instead."
5,Racer Buddies-Opening Day at Daytona,"We love Racer Buddies! This book has a great combination of engaging illustrations, an exciting storyline, and real NASCAR information. We bought this book for our little NASCAR fan. He and his dad have read it over and over again! We look forward to the next in the series."
5,I wish I had found these long ago.,"I purchased Foot Petals for my daughter to put in the heels of her new sneakers, as they were rubbing and chafing the backs of her heels. I was suprised at how well they worked! I didn't expect the adhesive to hold up, but they are still firmly in place and turned painful new shoes into something wearable. I was so impressed, I ordered a second set for myself."
4,Okay,These worked okay. I have yet to find a pair that REALLY work WELL! There is just nothing that fixes a pair of shoes that doesn't fit right.
4,Excellent Remixes But Flawed Remastered Original Version,"I have no complaints for the new 2006 remixes by Bill Hamel. They are excellent and transform this 1984 classic into a dancefloor anthem. The ""Hamel Album Mix"" as listed here on the CD single is not the exact same version as featured on the 2006 U.S. Rhino/Warner Bros. release, 'Future Retro'. It is basically the same recording but mixed with a slightly different intro and outro.My complaint here is for the ""Remastered Original Version."" The remastering here is excellent, aside from the random small pops and clicks in a few parts of the track. Originally I thought it was my CD player but I then copied the track into an editing program and discovered that the clicks were part of the recording. I can only assume that these pops and clocks are part of the original master or a mastering error. If anyone else has the same problem on their copy, please e-mail me or let other readers know."
4,a really enjoyable and memorable read,"i was skeptical when i picked this one up because lately so many of the books on the tables with the bright funky covers have been letdowns, but Just Peachy was a bright surprise. the writing was a cut above the usual with a lot of incisive descriptions and witty observations on people and life. rather than being distracting (which sometimes happens with the mystery subplots) the suspense/mystery part of this story was very intriguing and intertwined well with the growing love story of two friends and co-workers at work. i'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 only because i would've liked a bit more about Peach's roommate, BeBe, who ends up having a cute little romance of her own and i wanted to see more of how those two got together. as it was, it was a bit too abrupt for me. but other than that this was a really great read with two very charming and well-suited protagonists."
2,Boring,"Sorry to report but this bored me to tears. I liked the characters, but the book dragged on endlessly and it isn't very long. This ended up in the used book pile without even being finished. Oh well."
2,Not a full adapter,The adapter does not include a third contact to allow recharge on older rechargers. You will need a new charger as well if you want to keep using your old drills with the newer slide style batteries. Good quality other than that.
4,The Haunted Hotel,"The book The Haunted Hotel by Ron Roy is part of the A-Z Mysteries series. I have enjoyed many books written by Ron Roy. In The Haunted Hotel there is this ghost that terrorizes the hotel and three kids try to figure out who the ghost is. The main characters are Josh, Dink and Ruth Rose .The book is set in a hotel. It shows how hard it is to be a detective.My favorite part was when they found out who the ghost was. The book is very exciting and fun to read. I recommend this book for people who like mysteries. That's what I think of the book.By Hilda"
5,Cool look and great protection,"My son loves it because it looks cooller than the bike helmets and I love it because it looks to protect him more fully. I don't worry about him whether he is scooteing, skate boarding, riding bikes or roller blading. Head if fully protected. He is 9 and it fits him well with room to grow."
5,Helmet,This was exactly what I expected and there were no surprises. it works as promised and is getting used by my grandson.
5,helmet,"very good helmet. it fit perfect, looks good and fits very well. shipped very fast. was very pleased with this product"
5,Great!,"My 7yr old loves it, he hates the helmets that makes your head look like an alien! I don't have to argue with him to wear this one, which I think is great!"
2,Razor V-17 helmet,"The helmet is very nice looking, but it did not fit a 10 year old child..so, it is not worth the money."
1,"Looks cool, but too small",I got this for my 10 year old boy and it is way too small............He did love the way it looked!
3,Gift,I purchased this helmet for my grandkids to wear while rideing their scooter I purchased for them. I should have gotten a couple casue they all fight over this one.
4,Great headgear,Helmet fits my sons head with no problem. Product seems to be durable he has not had any accidents to test that part. It seems like any other helmet that would be purchased at at store.
5,Razor helmet,"Thanks, it got here in no time, my son will love it!! The helmet is perfect and too cool for school, as my son would say."
4,Great helmet,"My two boys received these helmets for Christmas. They look really cool and the boys are excited to wear them. They seem to fit good, also. Since they are still new, I am not sure how long they will last, but they seem durable."
2,too small,"Good quality and design, but far too small for my average-size, 10-yr old son. The helmet is advertized as suitable for 8-12 yr old children. Not the case. Suitable for 6-8 yr old children would be a better description."
5,Made well,Sturdy and made well. Well made on inside and and heavy enough for no head injuries. Do recommand for 7yrs and older.
4,Good Stuff,Got my 6 year-old grand-son this helmet and gel pads. Helmet was great ... fit a little loose but covered all the parts.... and he loved it.
2,Too small for boy turnin 9,"Good product but too small for my son turning 9 next week. (He is average size in general though I guess he could have a big head?) Of course, he had to wear it and scratch it up anyway. It will provide some protection until I can buy a larger size.Note that it comes with extra padding in case it is too small. I agree with earlier reviewer that better for 6 to 8 or for kids with small heads!"
3,"Was way to small for my 8 year old's head, she's not THAT big","Average height skinny 8 year old kid with what I think is a normal head...helmut too tight.Fits the 5 year neighbor's kids fine, he has it now."
4,"low price, the razor logo can not be peeled off","Low price. Save some $5 compared to picking up same helmet from major department store. Downsides: looks a bit bulky. Maybe check fitment in local store before ordering online. Annoyance: I usually peel off silly tape logos for a cleaner look, but the razor stickers are painted over with the glossy layer and can not be removed. Had to cover silly logos with reflective tape instead. ** Consider also: Brain saver 8 helmet -- seems to be popular at the skateboard park, especially in matte grey finish."
5,Great helmet,"This helmet is great. My son loves it, it provides great protection and the price was great. I would highly recommend it."
3,Perfect for Hiding In The Stands,"Please do us all a favor and go buy a navy blue Sox hat. ""Whoa, where is the top of that guy's head?!"" You're not fooling anyone with the Camo, buddy. I'm only giving this a 3-star because it has the advantage of hiding all those pre and post-game puke stains."
2,Incredibly hideous,"This hat is almost as bad as the pink Red Sox hats. Just like the title states, it is incredibly hideous. The only reason anyone should be wearing this hat is if he or she is a member of the United States Army. Otherwise, stick with the red or blue.I gave this item two stars because one is too low for a Boston Red Sox hat."
4,Was a hit,"This is such a unique item, we all wanted a piece at Christmas. my 2 year old nephew all the way up to my 52 year old dad. You don't see it every where so it was fun to have!"
2,Really disappointed...,"First off let me say I am a foodie. The 2 ""energy"" bars tasted terrible. Of course the other 3 ice cream products are delicious. But for almost $17.00 it is not worth it. Oh and the magnet is just a advertisement and didn't stick to the fridge."
1,Don't expect anything but ice cream?,I ordered this because the title says ice cream and food sticks...I received all ice cream. I don't have time to mess with a return. Change the title if it's assorted ice cream.
4,Think you know how access-lists work?,"Don't be so sure. This book covers it in fine detail. I like the algorithm that you can use to minimize the number of access-lists given two IP ranges. Time-based, reflexive, dynamic, CBAC, some TCP-intercept/NAT examples are all presented well. It also has some IPSec and Queing chapters (though I recommend ""Enhanced IP Services"" by Lee for those two topics) I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not quite Doyle/Clark level."
4,Excellent Book on Access List,Gives real life scenarios which makes this book valuable.There are a couple of typo mistakes.But on the whole a great buy.
4,A good Access List book,This book is an excellent reference and addition to what you learn in (otj or in-class)training.
2,A letdown.,"Like another reviewer, I had previously read ""Permanent Midnight"" and LOVED it, so I was definitely looking forward to getting my meathooks on more of Jerry Stahl's work. Unfortunately, this one turned out to be a major letdown. The first chapter was quite amusing, so my hopes were high, but as the book went on I just waited and waited for something engaging to happen, and it never did. The ending was so abrupt and lame, I got the impression that Mr. Stahl just got tired of writing and stopped.Don't waste your time with this one. Re-read ""Midnight"" instead."
2,"Pages 1-248, But Then...","I liked this book. I found it funny and it had some good insight into the times (early '70s). I thought Bobby was an interesting character, I wouldn't go as far as Holden Caulfield, but still interesting. The book is very well written, fantasic style, there were a number of good scenes, scenes that made me a little uncomfortable, but Stahl's words were getting a reaction, sooo... But then pages 249-319, 70 pages of torture to read and it really ruined the whole thing. The last 30 pages were just a bland wrap-up to tie all the logical ends together, but those 70 pages. It seems that Stahl revels in his former addiction to drugs and wants to let us know exactly what it was that he saw in those stupors, but do we really need to know in a book of fiction that doesn't really hint at the horrors of drugs until they are upon the characters? And of course that is the point. So, the lesson I learned was that not only can drugs ruin your life, they can ruin a good book as well."
2,relentless dependence on convenient coincidence,Stahl can write a great sentence; he can set a good scene. The biggest problem with this novel is Stahl's relentless dependence on convenient coincidence to move his story forward. It seems as if author has taken the easy out-too many times to count-even in the epilogue.
3,Modern version of 'Catcher in the Rye' ?,"Maybe. Make no mistake, this book is disturbing from beginning to end. The last scene with Bobby as a youngster in the Lincoln with the ""hippies"" is horrific. .... To be fair, I laughed out loud at some of the scenes and it is very well written. I'm not questioning Stahl's talent as a writer, I just wonder why this book was written. The life of Bobby is tragic and I fail to believe the person he becomes at the end of this book. ...."
4,Great Short Stories...,"Though I'm not a fan of short stories, I really enjoyed this book because all the tales are connected. These stories are about different individuals of the Kaplowitz family. A very large Jewish family who's spread out all over the place.My only issue with the book was just how large the family was. Between kids, and grand kids, husbands, wives...some chapters I had to go back to earlier stories to figure out who I was reading about, and what branch of the family they came from.Other than that, it was a really good book. These stories are of everyday trials that we go through throughout the span of our lives. I absolutely recommend this, and would definitely pick up another of Ms. Mattison's novels."
4,Quakers -Searching for the inner light,"This book is a compilation of writings from Quaker mystics. Goes from George Fox in 1600s England to more modern authors in their quest to understand God and social justice. Many members of the ""Friends"" today are agnostic and interested in only social programs, this book should be required reading for all who aspire to be a good ""Quaker"" and Christian."
4,Quaker history,"This book helps me learn more about the Quaker religion, essays by thr founder George Fiox, Margaret fell. William Penn, Quakers in England and America tc"
3,good Lego quality; but totally overpriced,"My grandson wanted this for Christmas. The lego store could not ship until the day before Christmas ($14.99 there)--not an option, and the only place where I could get it was Amazon. I paid $28.00 for the two boards before Christmas which I thought was totally ridiculous considering that more than one set will be needed to make it worthwhile.--only a grandmother!"
3,Not too impressed,"This is my first exposure to Gisselle. I am not sure if the problem is the recording (her voice is recessed, not spotlighted), the ho-hum music (not Kike Santander's best), or that Gisselle is just a good, not a great singer. The upbeat songs are pretty routine, and there are way too many ballads, none of them distinguished.I can easily imagine Olga Tanon singing these songs, and doing it a lot better, but poor material in recent years has not flattered her abilities either.I am interested in seeking out one of Gisselle's earlier albums, when when she was not ""moving to the international market"" - usually not a welcome move if you are a lover of real Latin music."
5,good combination of merengue and smooth ballads,"this is a great cd it is the first cd i bought of hers and it was a good first impression the albums best are the ballads voy a enamorate, jurame y quiente hace el amor y la version merengue of jurame is nice dime luna and no me enamoro are also good merengue songs all in all you guys will really enjoy listening to this cd"
5,"Gisselle,la nueva reina del merengue","Of our days the female merengue market is strong and competitive. Gisselle became the new queen of merengue and with her new CD that'a realistic evidence. To compare Gisselle to Olga Tanon I can say that Gisselle's merengue beats are more energic and more powerfull. In my opinion, Olga has a lot to do to catch out Gisselle's power.You better work harder girl!! And for Gisselle, te amo con mi alma."
1,poor quality,"what a disappointment.this hamper looks good in the picture but once i got it home and took a closer look, i was appalled.here's what i discovered:- poor quality weaving. i got pricked a few times touching this hamper. not good if you have children around, they may get splinters.- liner is exceptionally thin- hamper is light, it's unstable, and tips over easily.- both lid and hamper arrived chipped and cracked at the binding. i thought it was the poor packaging, so i exchanged for a new one and the second one arrived just a poorly.the only thing i like about this hamper is its compact size, but for the cost, $57.00, i might as well pay a little more for the sturdier and higher qualitySeville Classics Hand Woven Round Rattan Hamper, Teak, 16 by 23-1/2-Inch."
3,"Good, basic basket but watch for sharp edges","I've had this basket for almost three years now and it has held up just fine, including monthly washings of the liner. We spray painted it white with basic paint to match the nursery and it stuck.After no complaints for some time though, I am compelled to write a review because I actually cut my finger on the bottom of it when I turned it upside down to sort the laundry. I know small sharp edges are to be expected with a product made of natural materials, but this is beyond what is acceptable. I am going to need to cover it with felt or something so my little one isn't injured."
3,NOT SO SURE?,"I'LL RATE THIS A 3.5 FOR NOW BECAUSE I HAVE MY RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE MATERIAL USED TO MAKE THIS PRODUCT. ALTHOUGH IT STATES ITS A DURABLE MATERIAL, I FEEL IN COLD WEATHER IT WILL NOT FLEX AS WELL AS IN WARM WEATHER & I QUESTION IF IT WILL NOT CRACK DURING THE HARSH NEW ENGLAND WINTERS. DUE TO THE WAY THIS PRODUCT IS FITTED TO THE VEHICLE, IT DOES PUT STRESS ON THE VENT VISOR. THE FUNCTIONALITY IS GREAT. IT DOES AS DESCRIBED. MOST PEOPLE WHO SMOKE BUY THESE TYPES OF VENT VISORS TO BE ABLE TO SMOKE WHEN IT RAINS. THESE VENTS HAVE A LOW PROFILE AND STAY CLOSE TO THE WINDOW WHEN THEY ARE SLIGHTLY OPEN MAKING IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO DISCARD ASHES WITH OUT OPENING THE WINDOW FURTHER. INSTRUCTIONS ARE EASY BUT THERE IS A PLASTIC WINDOW GUIDE THAT IS USED AND IT IS NOT EXPLAINED HOW OR WHERE EXACTLY TO PUT PLACE IT. COMMON SENSE AND EXPERIMENTING WILL GET IT DONE. ADVICE: DO NOT REMOVE ADHESIVE ON VISOR UNTIL YOU ARE SURE ON THE PLACEMENT OF VISORS, AND PLASTIC GUIDE IS IN PLACE."
3,"Good Translation, Interesting Book","If you are a fan of Descartes, you'll definitely enjoy this book. It contains six meditations which bring reality and existance into question. The first meditation is excellent and will seriously make you question everything you know. However his arguments drop off from there. The big problem is that Descartes' arguments are cyclical (The Cartesian Circle) which not only negates his opinions but also makes it difficult to understand. I'd definitely recommend this book if you are interested in the history of philosophy or if you enjoy the rationalists."
1,"Great Book, Terrible Edition","I assign Descartes' Meditations in my Introduction to Philosophy course, and I was looking for a new edition to try this semester. Big mistake. This edition is riddled with typos (some of which completely reverse the meaning of a passage)and translation errors. I highly recommend this book, but get any edition other than this one."
4,got it.,Haven't had a chance to read this yet. Required text for a philosophy course. Skimming has revealed some interesting concepts...Descartes is met with mixed feelings regarding credibility. We'll see.
4,The journey through meditations,"This work, is a good translation of the meditations. The meditations allow people to get a taste of how man can get a deeper sense of who one is."
3,Difficult Read,"This book was translated from old French. It was in English but I could barely make sense of it and i'm into these kinds of books. I don't know whether it was his style that I didn't like or it was just plain hard to read. Could be because it was written so long ago.This book has words from the 1500's that no one uses anymore. The book discusses the soul and the body. Physics, Astronomy , Medicine and Science. This is 100 pages of heavy stuff. If you are very patient, interested in Philosophy and very smart you may like this book.."
4,Interesting and Informative,"I'm very glad I bought this book. I learned things about the George and Ira and other lyricists I never knew before; I am a ""word"" person; always listening to the lyrics to songs; love reading the bios of famous and not so famous lyricists of the 20's, 30's, and so on; if you like the music from this time period you will enjoy reading this book."
5,Excellent for understanding Native American Culture and for business application,"The Genius of Sitting Bull is a wonderful illustration not only of leadership strategies that are directly applicable to business, but for understanding and appreciating the techniques of a successful Native American leader. Leading in a culture where subgroups are highly independent of one-another, eventhough they share cultural heritage, poses interesting leadership challenges. A modern business organization which has highly siloed functional divisions can learn much from this book, particularly in the case where a CEO must tread lightly. The Lakota or Sioux did not have a ""chief of all chiefs,"" so Sitting Bull had to use power of personality and persuasion to get them to collaborate in what became their largest single feat of resistance to US military power."
1,So not worth the money,"While I really, really like the Pretika face brush, the lightsonic light therapy is pretty much a waste of your money. It is $$ that I didn't need to spend. So, if I can forewarn others, so be it. :)"
2,hhmmmm......,"I don't know about this. I've been using this regularly for over a month and see no change in skin tone or texture. It DID however, dry up my husband's poison ivy after leaving the light on it for 15 minutes. (Not completely, but better than I would've expected.) So I'm giving it 2 stars for that."
1,"Can you say, ""Piece of JUNK?""","Can I just say the Pretika ST197 Lightsonic Pulsating Light Therapy System is the biggest disappointment since the AMC Pacer! I have had, and used, the Pretika ST197 Lightsonic Pulsating Light Therapy System daily for 7 days. I changed the batteries daily, to make sure it was ready and raring to go. Well, on day seven (today) I went to use it, put new batteries in, and turned it on to use it... Well, it worked for a good 3 minutes, and then died. I even changed the batteries, AGAIN, and NOTHING. This thing is a piece of junk, and that is an understatement. I might as well have lit the $40 I spent on this, on fire. Save your money for something that actually works, and lasts."
2,Vibrating light therapy systen,"Was a bit disappointed in this item as I thought the LEDs wouldactually pulsate with i.e. 'frequency'. They do not, as the devicejust gently vibrates like a massager. But still useful."
2,Pretika ST197 Lightsonic system,The service I received when I ordered this was great but I'm not impressed with the machine. I don't feel it accomplishes what it says it will. I was going to return it but I tried the cream included and didn't think they would take it back like that.Frances
5,For the price it is worth it!!!!,"I bought a Pretika light about three months ago. My friend owns a spa so I knew about the light therapy.I love it, it lasts about one month following the directions. It does take time so to do while watching t.v or reading.I bought rechargable batteries and change every other day. I'm on my Pretika #2. For the price it is worth it!!!! My skin looks great,toned and freckles and age spots have gone away.People tell me all the time my skin looks great. I do not see my friend she charges 60.00 a visit and on #5 setting about the same as the Pretika.The bottom line is it takes some time and for the price it is worth it!!!"
4,Works well,"This item works well. It seems to take about 30 days after you use it (not 30 times but once or twice) until you see the result. I've heard, but am no expert that it takes about 20 to 30 days to start producing collagen again after your body stops producing it. My daughter in law says it got rid of the wrinkles in her neck and my face is looking good, neck got really nice."
4,age spots gone,"I purchased this product - very surprised. A large age spot on my eyebrow disappearing. Dried up cyctic acne UNTIL I used the products. Now I have 4 sore large deep cytsts around my mouth - Don't use products if you are sensitive to this type of acne. Too aggravated for pretika to ""dry out"" love the light it does work....smooth cheeks, dried out normal acne and brown spots gone."
5,Just perfect,"I worry about ordering breakable merchandize to be shipped to me. However, after pricing tea sets locally and finding that they were all totally out of reach financially, I decided to try the internet. I found this tea set, it looked nice, so I ordered it. It is for a gift from a gift request ornament taken from a tree that was for senior citizens.I was totally thrilled when I received the tea set today. It is even more lovely than the picture and I'm sure the senior citizen I bought it for will be thrilled. After pricing tea sets, I was really surprised at the excellent quality of this set for this price."
4,lovely set,I bought this tea set as a birthday present. It is lovely and the pictures do not do the colors justice.
3,Nice relaxing,Well I got this album originally because i thought that they were covers of Bolton's songs but they turned out to be instumental renditions. I was plesently surpirsed to find that they are very pretty versions of some classic Bolton songs. I just don't know where he sings Stand by Me because I love the song and love Michael's covers but I cannot find him singing Stand by Me anywhere. A very nice addition to your collection if your a big fan. ~Rich
2,very violent and disturbing,"I've read all the books before this one, and they became one of my favorite series. This book was different. When I was reading the beginning i got all excited, but then as I got to the middle I'm realizing, this is kind of violent, and scary. And then it just got worse and worse. Very, very violent, disgusting, scary, and disturbing. Now, every time I think about that book I get disturbed. I do not suggest this book for kids."
1,poor quality,"I purchased this watch in January of 2010 for my boyfriend. He loved it and wore it everyday. It kept good time and was a comfortable watch. Unfortunately the stemp pulled out and now it is worthless. I am hoping to be able to have it repaired, but it will be as much as I paid for the watch originally. I just wish it would have been better quality."
3,wording is unclear,"The item's description states ""adjusts from 4' 7"" to 5' 7"""". The crutches do not adjust in that range. The longest adjustment is closer to 4' 2"".The supplier was very understanding. They refunded my purchase cost.I procured crutches elsewhere.The rating which you insist must be entered, should be left un-selected. It may be an excellent item, but I cannot use the item."
4,Young man with a horn,"A very nice introduction to Chris Botti for those who haven't yet discovered his music. ""Indian Summer"" is currently in heavy rotation on CD 101.9 FM, a local light-jazz station. The CD features worthy covers of ""My Funny Valentine"" and ""The Look of Love"". I met Chris a few years ago at a BLUE Nights show (Bruford-Levin), which is recommended if you like music with a rough edge. A pleasant, versatile and true artist who deserves your attention."
2,Too Sterile,"Remember when jazz was full of characters? I mean distinctive, eccentric, brilliant, troubled people who had music and creativity in their souls and just let it all hang out in the studio and especially on stage, music like this reminds me of what we're missing these days. Not that Mr. Botti is completely lacking in talent, but there is nothing here that really stands out or makes you feel like you'll be hearing him 50 years from now. This is all about packaging, gloss and getting played on the radio. I gave it 2 stars for his clean, high timbre on the opener ""Indian Summer"" when he finally lets loose on the final 2 minutes of the track, but the rest of this CD is too flat, sterile and programmed to evoke any real passion and doesn't really need to be played more than once. This isn't jazz, this is easy-listening, pottery barn, wallpaper store background music for posers who pretend to know what jazz is. Skip It."
2,light under a bushel,"On one hand, this CD has a warm, hypnotic, romantic quality.One the other, this guy has, I believe a real talent, but he's hiding his light under a bushel, or more specifically under schlocky strings, syrupy arrangements, and bass equalized up way too high. He has, maybe,the sound, soul (and looks) of a young Chet Baker, (listen to Funny Valentine) but he really needs to get away from these Jazz-Lite Columbia arrangements.Like to hear him with a quartet! Let's hear what he can really do!Who knows, maybe the future will be Jazz-lite. Or maybe Jazz-lite will, ultimately, bring new listeners to Jazz."
4,"Jazz, Chris Botti",One of the best trumpet players living; on a par with Louis Armstrong. Not his best album but a keeper non the less.
5,Nearly flawless atmosphere music,"I debated over 4 or 5 stars. I landed at 5 simply because this is the most listenable cd's I have purchased in a long time. This will receive alot of airplay by me, and that makes it a great value.Musically, Botti is a charmer. He sets an upbeat mood with songs that are quietly complex. If you focus on listening, Botti provides intricate layers to keep the ear interested. If played while working or doing other things, the cd sets a pleasant and smooth mood.bravo---I am on my third listen of the day..."
3,excellent pop music work but only modestly Jazz.,"if you are a music fan, new to the jazz scene. you will love this CD. very easy to listen to and quite melodic.if you are a jazz fan who has been listening to jazz for a while, drop this CD as you may find it lacks a level of sophistication and complex element which is prevalent in main stream jazz.personally i enjoyed this CD but typical of most ""pop"" or ""smooth"" jazz, it only last for a few listenings. after all, this is not Miles' Round Midnight when you can listen to it forever.since Botti advertised himself as a ""jazz"" artist, i rate his music as a jazz critic. 3 stars.however, if i rate this as pop music, i would give it a 4 to 5 stars."
5,Botti's Best!,"I thought he would never exceed my personal favorite ""First Wish"". He's done that and more. No one other than maybe Rick Braun makes the trumpet sound so deep today! The Look of Love and the Lat Three Minutes highlight my list here. Enjoy!"
1,Thousand Kisses Deep,"I own all of Chris Botti's CDs and I listen to one of his CDs almost every day. Unfortunately, this is the worst CD that he has made to date. I highly discourage anyone from making the mistake of purchasing this CD. I will be selling my copy on e-bay to recoup my cost. This CD was highly anticipated but extremely disappointing."
4,Dogs that Do,"After reading through this small treasure by Marianne Murdock and Nancy Burgess I was impressed by the definition of these dogs by what they do not by how they look or how they represent a particular breed.Shortly after reading this book I saw the film ""Best of Show"" which represents the ""worst"" of dog's relationship to man. It is a pleasure to read about the relationship of the working dogs to the working men and women still living the western life.The poetry in the book, by Marianne Murdock, specifically The Bath, Chasing Rabbits and the very personal The Spirits of Dogs creates visual images laced with Western lore and ideas usually buried in history.This is a small book and would make a great gift for anyone who truly appreciates ""real dogs"" and the Western way of life."
2,Fun book for the price,I added this book to one of my purchases at Amazon and had a really good time reading through it. I could relate to certain parts of the writing but I enjoyed the photography most of all. In the end I have not recommended it to others.
5,THE GREATEST WARRIOR,"IF ONE UNITES WITH THE LAND HE WILL UNITE WITH EVERYTHING IN THE LAND:THE WATER, THE TREES, THE ANIMALS & EVERYTHING THAT IS LIVING FROM THE LAND: THE HUMAN RACE.ONE WHO WON'T FINDS HIS ROOTS HE'S DESTINED TO DIE!THIS IS A BOOK THAT ANYONE WHO STEPS IN THIS COUNTRY MUST READ IN ORDER TO FIND HARMONY.THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN A BOOK! IT IS A RISING GUIDEMAXIMUM RESPECT TO DENNIS BANKS AND ALL TRUE WARRIORSPEACECyrille B Autin"
1,Genocide by any other name.........,"America is a very, very, very old place. We were not here first and it is time we give back what is not rightfully ours. The American Indian is the original American and he should be able to do whatever he wants to do in America.Buy this book and let us free brother Leonard!!!!"
4,America Indian Information,"This purchase was required reading for a college class and the book was in great shape and an enjoyable read, even though it was required."
4,Turn and Burn - Barrel Racing Documentary DVD,This was exciting to see barrel racers interviewed and put in the spotlight. This sport deserves to be recognozed and appreciated. This documentary was informative and enlightening.
1,Nice Try!,"Pain of Salvation is among the few progressive acts that I couldn't recommend with a clear conscience. Though there is some skill in playing this, Pain of Salvation has zero talent. The reason I gave it a star is because they attempted to play complex music. I like music simply if an effort is put into making it! In this case, better to try and fail, than not to try at all. I don't understand what kind of sound Pain of Salvation is trying to achieve. The vocalist opens his mouth, and within moments I am eager to take this out of the player. It's neither dorky nor cool nor funny. I can't even laugh at this! Perhaps, someone who likes Disturbed could appreciate this. However, though they are a progressive band, Pain of Salvation is not even as good as Disturbed."
3,Marred by the lyrics,"I would have given this four stars for the music alone, which is, for the most part, interesting. It is definitely finding its way into my CD player. The lyrics are, however, irritating. Gildenlow's anti-consumerist, anti-capitalist, anti-wealthy rants get a little bit tired after awhile. Every once in awhile, he makes a fair point. However, there are just too many rants about those evil, greedy rich people who exploit the poor, absolutely guiltless poor people to ignore. At times, I feel like I'm listening to the recitation of a 19-year-old college freshman essay on Marxism."
1,Worst. Album. Ever.,"Pain of Salvation has been one of my favourite rock bands for years. I was soooo excited to hear this album and I can't believe how dissapointed I was. Musically uncreative, boring, sounds like re-hashed songs that the band members wrote when they were 16 years old. Unstimulating, boring. Not the kind of musical innovation I've come to expect from them.Nothing more to say."
2,"It's Just Not Good, Dog","I don't mind weird, goofy, self-indulgent music, but it has to be GOOD weird, goofy, self-indulgent music. This is just not good, fellas. PoS, what happened? The production seems cheap and the songs just don't live up to PoS's earlier stuff. The Korn mimmickery is plain awful and don't get me started on the 8-minute disaster, Disco Queen."
1,This album is a cop-out,TPE:1 was a conceptual and musical masterpiece. To call this TPE:2 is a total insult. They totally copped-out with this album and it's nothing more than a collection of condescending rants and whines from Gildenlow. The last two songs are the only really good ones on the album.A good album is timeless. This one (hopefully) will be very out-of-date and forgotten soon.
2,"Gildenlow, America's sick of you too!","Pain Of Salvation has taken a nosedive since Remedy Lane, which was one of thier best cd's. Scarsick has some great tracks on it, then you hear CRAP like America which should serve to alienate any of pos's American fans, and if it doen not, those fans are not true Americans, they choose a band over thier country! Then you get Disco Queen - what the hell is this? The short of it this - if America and Disco Queen were not on this CD, it might be good. I'll stick to listening to the earlier P.O.S. releases."
1,Nothing New for Those Familiar wtih Orangutans,"This book is written by two experienced field researchers. The information presented in the book is more like a review - no new information is presented. Furthermore, information presented on orangutans in captivity is presented in a very negative way despite the fact that neither author has any experience with the care or captive husbandry of this species. Although this species faces possible extinction in next 20 years or so, no concrete, realistic actions steps are given to solve the ""real socio-economic"" problems in in the countires where orangutans are found. Overall, a very disappointing book."
4,Looks good on display.,"I take these products out of their boxes and put them on display that way. This figure was relatively easy for me to put it into its base, and it looks very nice, the greens are bright but not fluorescent and the two greys, dark and light, look nice. The only problem I found is that my figure's tail has the metal rod that makes it flexible showing in part of it. It is however easy to display so that that defect doesn't show."
4,great dragon funny head pose,"This dragon is great looking (like the Sleeping Beauty dragon), the only problem I have is with the head. The way the neck is posed you can't really see the head and horns. I would like it better if the mouth was open, making it look more fierce. Some of the spines have rough edges, I took an X-acto knife to trip up."
3,An interesting alternative to the usual by-the-numbers American fare,"Two female roommates in Paris employ their sensual powers to move up the corporate ladder and to establish a network of guys to essentially use as they will, both financially and emotionally. As expected, there's lots of sex (oh, those French), but in the end this is a real movie with some interesting things to say. However, without revealing too much, I will say this: in the movie's closing moments, we learn that a character has gotten off ridiculously and unbelievably easy for committing a capital crime several scenes earlier, which took me out of the story for a moment or two. Having said that, this movie is still definitely worth a look. The DVD features a nice, sharp widescreen image and a few modest extras."
2,"Starts well, goes downhill","Secret Things starts well, but descends into a plot about vindictive females and males, involving too many characters, none of whom are likable. Toward the beginning, the movie seems to be about two exhibitonist females and their bond together. But the film becomes a workplace drama involving bosses and the company's son, who is like a French version of Caligula. The movie is some kind of cross between Dangerous Liaisons and the last 30 minutes of Eyes Wide Shut. It has some hot sex scenes to be sure, but not a strong enough plot to rescue it. Disappointing."
3,..enjoyable sensual drama..,"I bought this looking for some decently explicit lesbian movies and in many ways I found this to be quite enjoyable, a believable, well acted story line with some srong characters...The story revolves around 2 young women one sexually experienced and confident the other shy and innocent... how they use their sexuality to manipulate men... all works well but soon things turn ugly for both... there is a fair amount of nudity and lesbian sex scenes which fit in well with the story... as usual the lighting, camera angles and distance from the subject make it a little less graphic than it could have been... all in all it was enjoyable."
3,Secret things,"Fell below my expectations, the movie is interesting but, the rhythm is not quite there, tends to be jerky. The acting and the scenes lack passion and intensity which could have done justice to a theme that is strong and must be portrayed with much ""in your face"" scenes and dialogues. Passable to watch."
3,It's O.K.,"The movie was O.K. It's about two women and how they try to get to the corperate ladder. A couple of good sex seens, but nothing grafic. It's all in french, with english subtitles."
4,Review of the Shotokan Karate DVD,"I found this to be a great instructional video. We purchased the video because it was recommended by my daughter's karate instructor for home training/practice for the kata. I gave the video 4.9 stars only because of being dated. Otherwise, the kata and the moves helped my daughter get her yellow belt. The video has a breakdown of the moves and there is a section where you can work through the moves quicker for more advanced practice. Great video. Easy to follow."
2,A different movie,I was in this movie. I admit it is not the best but for my first acting experience it was great. it was filmed in 115 degree heat.
3,Gromit Collectible,The Gromit action figure was part of a group of action figures I bought to use as a decoration for my kitchen. My husband and I are great fans of Wallace and Gromit. We show their movie to our friends and then they understand the decoration. It brings smiles to their faces. The figures are great fun to look at and we enjoy them as a decoration. These are not toys to us but collectibles.

5,Nice Read,"This is a very fluently written book. I take channeled material at it's face value. If it sounds right, it's probably true; at least that's my perception. There is a large series of ""Seth Material"" books, and they all sold well. My aunt used this book with her study group, and they all claimed it to be informative and uplifting. I would say, though, that the master of all channeled books is, ""A Course in Miracles"". Since this is an older book, may I suggest buying a used copy? Also, both are available on kindle."
5,Eye-opening,"This is a pretty insightful book. It answers many of life's questions from a believable source. It's at times heavy and hard to comprehend what Seth means, but rereading helps. Worth the read."
4,"SETH ""Again!""","Wonderful book! I had previously read allthe Jane Roberts ""SETH"" books, but not this one . . .Could not get it when I wanted it ---- This now makesmy collection ""complete"", and if you have enjoyed any of theSETH books, you will really appreciate understanding howit all started for Jane, with MUCH, very interestingSETH material. For me, it was a ""must read!"""
1,Entertaining work of fiction,"It was entertaining, interesting and a work of pure fiction. Jane Roberts had quite an imagination and I suspect she understood the gullible nature of humans...at least Seth did."
4,"Very good for a ""Jane"" book.","The story of Seth and how Jane and Rob started communicating with Seth. It contains some of the information further elaborated on in Seth Speaks. I had originally put this book off because it looked more narrative and less informative but this was an incorrect judgement on my part. Like many other book series I would recommend reading the Seth works in the order in which they were written for the best comprehension. This book is a ""Jane"" book which contains some excerpts from Seth sessions."
2,useful but...,"We just recently got a Golden Retriever puppy and thought this book would be extremely useful. It does have some valuable info in it, but some of the methods seems a little over the top. If you ""click and treat"" as many times as it's mentioned you won't have time to do anything else with your day."
4,Excellent monitor for the price,"I have had this monitor for a while, and I love it. Clear visuals and great color. I would recommend it to my friends and family, and have. I know 3 people that have bought one on my recommendation, and they all love it too."
1,missed song,"When it listed to tracks on this cd it said that there is a song on it called ""Lovesick Melody"" and I got the cd just for that song. When I recieved the cd, it didn't have that song."
2,"This book is a reference book, not for teaching","This book mainly explains the meaning of each function. For example, what does ""color"" mean? What does ""tiff"" mean? It goes on and on. In the first several hundreds of pages, the book never introduces any projects. It looks more like a dictionary. Without a project, these explanations do not mean anything. I was given all the definitions. I don't know why the book tells me all these. I think a reader will learn better only when he needs to know.The book just went through the list of functions. It is not very exciting at all. I read several hundreds of pages, but I still don't know what to do and why I need to know these."

4,"fun, fast and positive","Awesome positive hardcore from California. Sweet God, these guys sound a lot like Minor Threat musically and vocally, lets face it, but great songwriting and pretty good lyrics make them stand out on their own.If these guys were from New York, I'm sure every hardcore kid would flip out as much over UC as they do for Chain of Strength, Gorilla Biscuits or YOT. But, they aren't, so I think UC doesn't get the respect and recognition they deserve.I like that Uniform Choice can keep the speed up, but stay nice and melodic at the same time. I love when bands can do that, y'know, be catchy but not wimpy sounding. UC accomplishes this beautifully. I even like the spoken word piece at the end of the album.Even if yoiu ain't edge, check UC out. Great band."
4,borders exclusive for the moment,At the moment Borders stores have an exclusive dvd release of this which is out now.
3,Not for the squeamish!!,"This story is set in the 1980's, in the waning days of the Ceacescu regime in Romania, where abortions are illegal. A young college student gets pregnant and she and her roommate scheme to have an illegal abortion in a low-rent hotel room. The abortionist insists on getting paid in kind in exchange for doing the deed. The roommate, Otilla, is a friend indeed and goes to extreme lengths to help the pregnant girl. The actress who plays Otilla does a masterful job. The preggers roommate, Gabriella, seems childlike herself and clueless.At times, this movie is hard to watch, due to the abortion scenes. At the end, you are glad the movie is over for the same reason you enjoy hitting your head against a wall - it feels so good when you stop.Not a bad movie, but it might be a stretch to call it ""entertainment."""
3,Wished I liked it better,"This is worth it to watch how terrified and isolated one could feel trying to receive an illegal abortion. Surprisingly, the director chose to focus not on the girl having the abortion but her friend who ends up doing all the work in setting up the abortion, meeting with the guy who performs it, getting some of the money, finding a hotel room, etc. She also ends up doing something she did not expect in order to ensure her friend's abortion will go as planned. While women were not in control of their own bodies while pregnant they also faced the harsh penalty of being jailed if ever caught. While this film felt realistic, I could go without the endless shots of behind Otilia's head and the rather long moments of her walking or riding a bus. I felt that the director could trim up 30 minutes or more off without sacrificing the integrity of the story."
2,Seriously?,"I watch a LOT of foreign films, and I have no issues with the subject matter here, but this was just a boring film. What a waste of time."
4,Chilling Experience!,"It is a movie which can be termed as terrifying at the same time you will appreciate the superior movie making. The movie takes you so near to the main two characters, that you will start to share their apartment, thoughts, risks and above all, fear.Great movie! Superb casting and acting!A must watch for serious film lovers. No light moment in the entire piece!"
5,you can make a great movie without any special effects,"Kept me awake until 1AM. Now I have to go to sleep. Great movie, it is very difficult to watch if you have a baby."
1,Not good,"This battery is horrible, it's suppose to be extended life? It dies quicker than my original battery I had in my Nextel. It last 2 days if I'm lucky and don't use my phone a lot if at all. Don't purchase it."
1,read the description carefully,"No-one to blame but myself. While the description does say ""an article"", it also clearly says this is a book review. No pictures, not much info, a one page book review."
5,Exciting,"If you are a Harry fan, or not, you'll love it anyway. All I could say is that the music was great, and it was nothing but exciting!"
4,Pretty good...,"Since finding and listening to Michael Buble, I've been turned on to this style of music."
3,Too good to be true....,"I have been wanting to purchase a foodsaver for many years but thought the price tag was too high. So I found this model on sell here at amazon.com. I bought 2 units one for my mom and the other for me. At first, I was amazed at the great deal with the bags, canister, and overall apperance. Well after two weeks of seldom use, I've noticed that some bags were not air tight. After a few days, you could easily tell that the bag was leaking air. I noticed that my mother's model had a canister that failed to hold a seal. Well three days ago, my motor just shut down and continues to make a mumbling sound. Seldom use!!Amazon.com shipped me another one and I sent the defective back. They are awesome! BTW, Kmart sells the bags and accessoriesPros: Great bundle, excellent appearanceCons: Wasn't dependable, Broke easily"
5,Best on the market,"This product is the very best there is! It vacumes the air out and seals flawlessly, each and every time. I have tried other brands but none of them come close to matching the quality of this brand.When you first start using it, you must press very very hard to close the unit, but after using it a few times, it seems to get a bit easier. None-the -less, don't be alarmed, it is normal.I am able to put a lot more stuff in my freezer now because of the space I'm saving by using this product instead of zip lock bags or plastic containers.Get it--you'll love it!!"
4,Handy item at a GREAT price!,"I'm glad I waited for the price on this to come down. It has worked very well for me, from bagging chicken, fish, venison and other food items. I'm sure any complaint is true for all of these products (having to get the bag exactly flat so as not to leak, etc.)Very pleased with it so far"
2,Not a good product,"I've owned three seal-a-meal vacuum sealers and all failed working correctly-one in as little as a two weeks. Customer service was excellent and quickly sent me a replacment for each unit but they kept breaking down. Either the seal is inadequate or the vacuum doesn't finish before it starts to seal. I junked the last unit and just bought a Foodsaver. So far my impressions of the Foodsaver are much more favorable-lighter, wider seal and easier to line up the bags for sealing."
3,not to satisfied,it work preety well I have to reseal alot of things does not pull all the air out of the bags all of the time and I have to re do them. maybe I am not doing it right. but I follow the directions.
1,Strawberry Twizzlers just aweful,"I've never had these before, and I'll never buy them again. They were disgusting, did not taste very good, texture was terrible, I thought I was eating plastic! I threw the whole lot out."
4,"Easy to mount, easy to wire......., somewhat expensive","Seems to work, but I wouldn't know. With that said, I sleep better at night knowing my telco lines are protected. It is also very easy to mount and wire, but its a little on the expensive side."
5,Everyone should have one,over the years we have lost dozens of phones and even the phone system a few times due to lighting so when i found this i got it and haven't lost anything since:-) this was a little more expensive then some of the cheap ones but the fact that it can do all our lines and has a lifetime warranty was enough to make the decision a simple oneyou can run each line through it's own port or as i did run them all through the top one.i would recommend it to anyone:-)
5,A Stuffed Train--great Idea!!,"I bought this for my 9 month old granddaughter to be her 'first train'. We are a family of train lovers so I was very pleased to find this cute toy. It is light enough for her to pick up, and very safe with all fabric and stuffing. The train's cars all are different, with cute lift up windows, different textures of fabric, crinkly fabric, etc.It seems sturdy and I think she'll play with this a lot. Hoping she'll feel included when her bigger brother gets his first train at Christmas.Very nice overall."
4,Average,"Slowly breaking in, had some nice bombs. Nothing over 300 though.Using a rubber mallete to soften the sweetspot."
5,Finally! A Book for Real Enthusiasts.,"Jack Wattley's conversation with experts on the Discus was a breath of fresh air after reading several other books which deal with the setting up and mainainance of an aquarium in some detail and then adding a few comments on the paricular needs of the discus fish. Also, it differs from other books which contain only the author's views on discus keeping and breeding - Wattley presents us with the opinions of no less than fourteen experts from different countries on a multitude of points covering a number of topics. The discussion of diet was especially interesting."
1,Item not received,I still have not received my itemWhat's goin on ?This is the first time Ives used this sight...Not sure if I will again.
5,A Solid Gem of a Film,"Yes, it's half a campy film but also half a 1980s classic. The story is certainly far-fetched but Peter Weller, Goldblum and many other blossoming actors turn 'Buckaroo Banzai' into a sci-fi flick begging to be watched. Great special effects and a premise not to be soon replicated, BB stands out as one of the most bitchen films fromthe 1980s."
5,The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai,"If you like sci-fi with comedy added you will love this movie. Some of the dialog you can't believe is really said with a straight face.Our hero is not only a scientist,advises the President, a rock star with his own band, whoos and wins the girl and of course travels across the 8 dimension. This is a must have movie as far as I am concerned."
1,Not for me!,I did not like this movie. In search of good cult movies this is not one in my opinion it jumps around and trys to be everything.Great cast good colors what disappointment. Rent it or not.
3,great movie but doesnt age well,"I loved this movie when I first saw it about a decade ago on cable. I still enjoy it, but it doesnt have the same pizazz it had back then. I dont know why, but I find it hard to sit through entirely now."
3,Odd but interesting,This is definitely not something that will appeal to everyone. My opinion improved after repeated viewings.
5,This says it all,"""No matter where you go, there you are"". I think this says it all. Enjoy this cult classic.(This quote, incidentally, was the theme of Lollapalooza `93)."
4,BIZARRE AND BRILLIANT,"this film isnt like the ordinary run of the mill ,it happens to be pretty bizarre which makes it so entertaining the plot revolves around a brilliant scientist who in his spare time is part of a rock band called buckaroo banzai and the hong kong cavaliers (uckaroo banzai is peter wellers character )now buckarroo(weller0 creates a car which enables him to travel at supersonic speed acroos the sand flats inside of this incredible vehicle he has installed a oscillation verthruster thus enabling him to travel to the strange world of the 8th dimension im going to stop there but i think you can see where im coming from id recommend this to anyone who likes something a bit different like me (its great with little otik and eraserhead both weird films hunt them down too)the stars in this fim are peter weller,john lithgow jeff goldblum christopherlloyd and ellen barkin buy it now"
4,finally released again,"for something like 10 years this film has been out of print. I was doubtful that it would ever be released on DVD, considering all the controversy surrounding it.THere's a lot of internal jokes on the DVD, references to Bonzai being a real person, which is sort of cute and amusing when it is pulled off correctly. It finally has all of those deleted scenes that everyonje has been clamoring for, for years.If you watch this film though, be prepared to have your eyes and your senses assaulted by garish 80's fashions, 80's music, and some of your favorite stars with 80's hair. This entire film is so stuck in its time that it's hard to get past, unless you just let go and follow Peter Weller in his Miami Vice fashions and jump into the fun.Remember, no matter where you go, there you are. And, coming soon, Buckaroo BOnzai versus the World Crime League."
4,"Silly, cool, and a real flight of fantasy","This is one very imaginative movie that apeals to that kid in you who pops out to do air guitar or think about how cool it would be to be on the go and have connnections and be a colorful mixture of science and art with cowboys and punks and aliens. This edition with the director's commentary answers and inspires more questions. Once and for all,the watermellon is explained. That is all I am going to write. If you like comic books, you should like this movie."
4,Too much fun to explain,"I first saw this as a teen, and fell if love with Perfect Tommy because he was, well, ""perfect"". I wanted to be part of the Hong Kong Cavaliers, a geek squad who cut open brains by day and rocked the house by night. Most of the cast have gone on to bigger things, Jeff Goldblum for example, but this will always be one of my favorite movies of their respective careers.John Lithgow and Christopher Lloyd were hysterical in pseudo-serious roles as aliens named John, and Peter Weller was just adorable as the brain-surgeon leader of the good guys. These days it shows its age more than ever with lame special effects, but watch it anyway. It's fun :)"
5,"Anywhere you go, there you are.","I so enjoyed this movie when it first came out in 1984/1985. This was only the second time I'd seen it, but like The Hitchhiker's Guide, or Office Space, this movie instantly sticks with you. It's funny and relaxing. Yet you have to stay engaged to understand it. Suspend disbelief, relax & enjoy.Also, the Amazon On Demand video worked well on my system. I am supposed to have a fast Internet connection, but my ISP is sometimes really under the curve when it comes to download speed, yet the entire movie played without a hiccup."
4,buckaroo banzai,"good movie that I now have in my personal library, that is why I am here to shop for movies on dvd format.Astronomy 101 Collection (Killer Klowns from Outer Space / Spaceballs / The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension)"
3,"Laugh-a while you can, monkey boy!","Original work - difficult to classify. Glib, violent, comedyscience fiction/fantasy action adventure? Back story perhapsoverreaches, overwhelming modest story line, which is alsolittered with one liners competing for the audiences' attention.Funny and interesting characterizations (caricatures) by thetalented cast. Also difficult to classify: the audience, whichdidn't manage to sustain this franchise. I thought this film wasterrifically funny when I first saw it in the mid-eighties, butnow it seems a bit heartless."
4,Two Words: John Bigbootay,"Frantic and often incoherent, this films weaknesses are also its strengths. You could spend several sittings just grasping the storyline, several more on all the goings-on in the background. Campy, but all the more fun because of 'serious' tone; anyone who's read comics will recoginze a 'Crisis'-level adventure.Defining element; Rastafarians are from the 8th Dimension (which I already knew...).(...)"
5,"Pure Unadulterated Hollywood Summer ""Camp""","If you liked Repo Man, Mars Attacks, Big Trouble in Little China, then don't hesitate! I love all those other movies but I still prefer this one. Just look at all those big names: Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin... Yea, they probably sorta regret that this movie has gotten more attention than some of their other ""serious"" films but hey, it's just better! Want proof? Just look at all the fan web sites around, the prices Buckaroo memorabilia commands on auction sites, the oft quoted lines, I could go on. Oh just buy it for planet's sake ;o) And just remember, No Matter Where You Go..."
2,Not so hip after all,"Sadly this is a movie that has not stood the test of time. The jokes are dated, the performances are unconvincing, and what one seemed outrageous now seems tame. It's destined to be forgotten along with ""Strange Invaders"" and ""Earth Girls Are Easy."""
1,it's bad...it's so bad it's bad,"I sincerely tried to watch this movie. I was embarrassed for the people in it, for the people who wrote it, basically for everyone involved, including myself because I actually laid down $2.00 for this piece of crap.It was worse than Ice Pirates. I like B movies. I like bad science fiction. But this was beyond belief. I made it to about 20 minutes before it was gonna end and just couldn't take it anymore. I felt like my head was gonna explode.I keep thinking to myself, ""I can't get those precious minutes of my life back."" It really bums me out, man. But hey, maybe it was meant to be. Maybe I was meant to waste away part of my life in order to save you from wasting yours. Take my advice: stay far away from this movie. Try something more productive, like picking your nose."
1,Oh God Make It Stop,"I bought this DVD because people have been saying this is one of the best movies ever made. Really? This Turd? Oh my God, this thing is almost as bad as Blood Rayne (which IS the worst movie ever made). I've always wondered how I missed this movie when it came out in the 80's. Now I know: showing someone this movie is considered emotional abuse in 39 states, and torture by the Geneva Convention. Just say, ""no."""
1,There's no there there...,"I'm sorry but I have to go against the flow of positive reviews and say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has moments - isolated performances such as John Lithgow's speech to the other aliens - that are pretty funny, but as a film it is a completely disjointed mess. There are many scenes that don't seem to connect to anything. The editors could just have easily shuffled the scenes and put them together in random order since it doesn't make any difference (and maybe they did). And could the acting have been more non-existent? No Mabel, it couldn't! Instead of getting well known actors it would have been easier for the film makers to wander around town until they found and recruited a local garage band. If you want to see a really bad sci-fi film that is funny in spite of its' awfulness have a look at Zardoz. If you really need Buckaroo Bonzai do yourself a favor and just get a movie poster - it will be less painful."
5,A Must See Sci-Fi Clasic!,"""Always Remember, No Matter Where You Go, There You Are."" The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai is one of the best low budget sci-fi films ever made. Lots of big names in the cast, before they became big names. Lots of quotes that seem to have gained a life of their own in other movies as well. Lots of dark humor and things you may miss till you've seen it several times. This is a movie that you must see if you like sci-fi. ""Where are we Going? - Planet 10"" ""When? - Real Soon!"""
4,Should have been a cult classic,"This is a good Sci-fi spoof by a cast of talents especially John Lithgow, the evil invader from the 8th dimension,and it is packed with oblique references. Hilarious - I wish it was still available."
4,Classic 80's SciFi Fun,"This movie has been a favorite of mine since I was a teenager. HBO seemed to show Buckaroo Banzai every day for about 3 years. So much fun. Viewing the movie as adult, it had a slower pace than I remembered. However, all of the charm and humor was still there. Anyone who enjoys movies like Time Bandits, Ice Pirates, or Brazil will love this movie.The quality of the DVD is a little cheap. Lame menus, not many extras, but the quality of the print is decent."
4,Finally on DVD,"The picture on this DVD is quite exceptional, and the I found the sound to be a huge improvement over the VHS version I watched again and again in the 80s. A couple of the extras are interesting -- a computer-generated teaser trailer for the proposed Buckaroo Banzai TV series and an interview with the director -- but I found the ""new scenes"" to be disappointing. Few of them are more than five seconds long and most were cut with good reason.If you're a fan of the movie, though, you'll probably appreciate the better picture and the little goodies on the disc."
3,There's a lot in this film!,"Wow. This movie has a lot of cheesy scenes, characters, and props. If all you want is simple entertainment then this is probably the film for you, although simple may not be the right word. A bunch of characters (the Hong Kong Cavaliers) led by a genius/rock musician (Buckaroo Banzai) fight against aliens from the eighth dimension (who sound like they are Jamaican). The thing is, we the viewers are supposed to know who these characters are and I confess, having seen this in the theater when it was released, I had NO idea who they were talking about. The plot was barely convincing and some of the actors seemed to be just playing along. The movie included some of the ugliest spacecraft I've ever seen but John Lithgow does a great character in Lord Whorfin. It was fun to watch and performances by the majority of the cast were excellent."
5,"""Laugh-a while you can, monkey-boy!""","I will begin by saying this is one of my top 5 favorite comedies, right up there with The Big Lebowski, Animal House, Caddyshack, and Barry McKenzie Holds His Own. That should give you enough info to decide if my opinion means anything to you ;-)I don't have anything to add to the 136 (and counting) five star reviews, but I am amazed at the 14 one star reviews (or should I say ""hatchet jobs""?). It is easy to say ""they don't get it"", but I'm d****d if I can understand why. Oh, well, ""different strokes for different folks"", as we used to say. ;-)That they are in a very small minority is obvious (14 out of 150 to compare the two extremes), so you have a 90.6 % chance of loving this film. So buy it! ;-)RichBTW, I agree with Donald Winsor that it is worth finding a copy of the novel. It was republished and is available here on Amazon along with some comics. There is also a website. Google ""Banzai Institute""."
3,Worth a look,"This isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it definately has it's moments. John Lithgow is very funny as a scientist gone nutty. All the aliens are named ""John""."
3,Before What the Bleep,"Although a very ""B"" movie, it's quirky and funny at times, cheezy most of the time, but does have some cool tidbits about quantum physics that make worth watching. Even if it is only once :-)"
2,Still Disppointing,"Despite reading even more enthusiastic reviews, and watching it again, I still can't really get into Buckaroo Banzai very well. It's good up to a point, but the 80's still look awful, and I don't like Peter Weller (in this), or Jeff Goldblum in anything.If Penny Priddy could be digitally re-clothed and given a new hairdo, she'd look great.""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Little Shop of Horrors"" are similar in a dated, campy way to this movie, but they're both actually good."
2,(Mostly) 25 Word Or Less Review,"Grows less quirky and more tedious with time. Promising cast with little to do but ham (when allowed that much). DVD sidenote: Packed with more inane ""goodies"" than anyone could possibly want to see."
2,Dont trust other peoples reviews!,"I brought this just judging by other peoples reviews, and its really bad, filled with 80's humour that isin't even close to funny, sure theres lots of extras but, because the films bad the extras are bad aswell. If (like me) your not really in to Sci Fi but think this movie will be funny, based on all the 5 star reviews, THINK AGAIN! I know its meant to be bad, but this isin't bad/good like Killer Klowns or Killer Tomatoes........... Its just plain bad!"
2,pure torture,"Like many other reviewers here, I have tried and tried to watch this film in its entirety. But it's just not possible. This movie is tedious. The entire opening home-movie sequence is incredibly laborious. There are a few funny moments in the film, but overall, this movie is painful. The folks at the School of The Americas could probably use this movie as part of their torture training program. John Lithgow's performance is excrutiating to watch. It's uncomfortably over the top. I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters and fell asleep. This movie is BAD. People say it's a cult classic, but it's nothing like the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is a true cult classic."
2,I like cult movies.. but this?,"Maybe it's just me, but I just can't get into this movie. It took me a week to get though this movie 15 mins at a time, it was that bad.Some of my friends love this movie and I just can't figure out why, it's not funny, slow paced and the acting (except for John Lithcow (sp?)) is horrible. I gave this movie a second star just because I think ""Laugh while you can monkey boy!"", is a really funny line.Unless your a hardcore Peter Weller fan, or a fan of everything ""cult"" stay away from this movie."
4,Disappointed and then satisfied,"I was a little miffed at receiving a DVD that I could not watch! I was very happy however that a label was put on the outside warning me not to open unless I was sure that my DVD player could actually Play DVDs from Zone 2 - who knew? Alas, mine could not and I emailed and received direction on how to return the DVD. I did that and have yet to receive a refund but I am patient.I went back to Amazon.com and found a new The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai in the Eighth Dimension that was for Zone 1 and I played it and loved it! It brings back great memories - haven't seen it since the late 80's! So nice to see Peter Weller playing intelligent, tender-hearted, rock star!! =) John Lithgow is ""crazy"" good and John Big Boote!!!! My kids love Cyberchase and I love telling them that ""the Hacker"" has been in many TV and movie shows - they've never seen Back to the Future - I do love Christopher Lloyd!!!!"
5,"Awesome movie, excellent service","I saw this movie nearly 20 years ago and loved it, so when I saw it was available I jumped on it. I received it promptly and it was in great condition. My kids loved it too."
4,You either Love it or Hate it!,I'm on the Love it side. This is one of those movies that you watch a few times before deciding. I guarantee you will see something you missed the last time you watched it. Silly but fun.
2,READ DESCRIPTION BEFORE PURCHASE,"Thought as in picture they would be assorted colors...lol all dark pink,make sure to read everything before purcghasing. Daughter loves them though"
2,Misleading picture,"Make sure to read the description. This is not a variety pack, it is just the pink color. Disappointing. Obviously, I should have read it more carefully, but the image is definitely misleading."
5,The plectrum choice,Hello ...I have been playing electric guitar for many years.The Delrin guitar pick is the plectrum of my choice.They are smooth and have clean edges. I tend to be an aggressive picker and this materialholds up quite well.
1,Can I suggest : The sickest girl in the world ?,"NOT a good book!!!, well I certainly agree with that. it's a great subject but still doesn't make it.the book deals with a ""mental problem"" which is depressive without any strings attached, imagine adding a lot more.she's popular ,rich and in a inclusive school? and oh.. by the way she's a bit of psychopath who keeps making holes in her skin and ends up with a crack in her head.moves on to a hospital, then ends up in a mental therapist who pours more oil on the blaze.dealing with such things -in my opinion- must be done in a way that builds a bridge between the problem and the solution. how would an individual with such a problem like Katie's ever decide to give therapy a chance? it's like saying ""I wanna get off this damn life"" to someone who is about to kill himself.Sad story, dark lines and unfinished ending .. what where you thinking Doc.?"
5,Awesome book!,"This book was beautiful and wonderfully written. I think everyone should read it, it helps you develop an inside view of what exactly a teenager is thinking when they hurt themselves. It opens your eyes..you can relate."
2,Too Simplistic,This is the first book I've read by this author. I was disappointed in the writing style and with the content. The difficulties Katie faced were too cliche' - it was like she had all these obvious problems that would of course add up to self-destructive behavior. There was no mystery to her way of thinking or why she ended up where she did.
2,simplistic and inaccurate,"Levenkron takes an incredibly complex subject and turns it into a movie of the week. He's got his facts wrong -- the type of repetitive/compulsive self-injury he depicts is not related to psychosis at all. It's obvious that the all-wise, all-loving incredibly perceptive white-haired male psychotherapist is meant to be him, and the school counselor he uses as contrast is a cartoonish bad guy. The reader never really gets a good idea of what's going on, why the girl cuts, or why she stops. It's not the worst possible book on this subject, but I'd've expected better."
2,Don't bother,"This book was a pure vanity project on the part of the author. I couldn't believe how one-dimensional the characters were. It appeared to me that the only person Levenkron really thought about was the kind therapist (which couldn't possibly be based on HIM, could it? ) Katie and her mother seemed like characters in a Sunday afternoon television movie. By the way, I am a ""cutter,"" have had contact with many other cutters, and have read more books and articles on the subject than any of my therapists. A skating star who receives straight A's is not a typical injurer at all. So please don't compare me with this girl. She and I are not alike in the slightest, except for cutting. Levenkron's other book, ""Cutting"", is much better and will give more insight on someone you love who cuts."
5,I really could relate to this book i loved it,When I saw this book and started to read it I couldn't put it down. I really could relate to Katie I felt like I was kind of becoming her. I am 13 the age of when she started cutting herself and i have delt with it myself. Although I didn't cut for the same reasons i really could understand her pain and her embarrassment of what she was doing. It was an Awesome book and I am really happy to know that it is not something you should hide and feel horrible and worthless. I loved the book thank you for writing it.
4,A 1-dimensional but fascinating portrait of a young girl...,"Although this book was intended to raise awareness about ""cutting,"" it also allows the reader to make a frightening journey into a disturbed human psyche. Katie and her problems are a bit cliched (as are the kind and gentle teacher and the ever-helpful therapist) and, as I said above, 1-dimensional, but the book is not spoiled by this. I am a 19 year old college student who has suffered from severe depression, so I was able to sympathize with Katie's out of control feelings. I recommend this book especially to people who have suffered from emotional disorders, but also to people who simply want to learn more about abnormal psychology."
4,I want a Dr Sandy,"This book deeply touched me. Although i do not identify with Katie's circumstances, reading this book made me feel her pain, pain that I am not un-familiar with. I found the character of Katie's therapist, Dr Sandy Sherman, extremely intriguing, as he understood Katie without having been there himself. If only every therapist were like Dr Sandy. I nearly cried whilst reading this book as Levenkron stays so close to the truth, and looks beyond the action and medical explanation of cutting. However I still felt like with many other books of this genre that it didn't go deep enough. I also felt every so slightly guilty, I live through the same pain as Katie but don't have the abusive Mother and gruelling shedule to justify it. I would like to see a book that looks at the feelings and workings of the brain more than the individual circumstances."
3,"a great book on a tramatic, yet all too true subject","i am a cutter. i identified with katie, in the aspect that i too am keeping it a secret. but a few things that i was disapointed in were how cliched her life was for one, and secondly, how ""rare"" it was in her school. even in a private school, she would have had some one to talk to. espeacily after her ""episode"", i'm sure a nother cutter would have sould her out to talk to her about it. even i can think of 6 people off of the top of my head who are cutters, or have tried to sit their wrists. but i did like this book."
3,Lucky girl,"I didn't think this book truly depicted what we true self-injurers truly go thru. this girl got off really easy. I too am a teenager, and even at that I found this book incredibly stereotypicalizing the entire thing. I was highly disappointed. But other then that I found it good reading, if you like fiction."
1,"I was ""Lucky"" to finish it","I thought this book was horrible. Unrealistic, nondescriptive, and pointless. As an avid, mature reader and a recovering self-injurer, I thought this book was simply a waste of time on the author's behalf."
5,Great book.,"I really enjoyed this product, it was a great book, shipped by a great company, and everything was very accurate. Thanks for your buisness!"
5,Works like a charm!,"This is an excellent product at a very good price! It was shipped quickly and packaged carefully. Works as advertised, delivering an excellent OTA signal to my son's new HDTV."
1,Don't bother,In theory this is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunatly it does not work. Don't waste your time or money.
5,Beautiful music for the soul. .,"This CD is a beautiful selection of songs and instrumental music to lift the soul. The first half of the CD are songs sung by Maranatha, the second half is an instrumental arrangement of the same songs. Just lovely."
5,Ginko rocks!,"I have been looking for a hammered flatware set like this for years and never found the right weight, feel or overall design ...we had dinner at the Lanai City Grille, on the island of Lanai, Hawaii, when we discovered this set...perfect...and what a price!...I noticed that a few reviewers said they had rust problems...since ours is new I cannot comment on that, however, Ginko stands by their quality so I am not worried about it for now..."
3,Love The Design But It Rusts Easliy,"I absolutely love the design and look of the hammered metal; but, this set started to rust in just 30 days. I'm looking for a higher quality set to replace this set and I have only had this set for about 7 months. Even though it is dishwasher safe, I would not recommend putting this flatware in the dishwasher. If you must have it, be ready to baby it to keep it nice. Hand wash immediately and towel dry right away. That's just not a realistic goal for me so I will be replacing this set."
1,Cautious shopper,Though the Ginkgo Lafayette pattern is being produced the new products are not 18/10 as stated. Theye are manufactured of 18/0. 18/0 has no nickle content and is inferrior to the 18/10 version that Ginkgo was producing. I questioned Ginko regarding the switch to a less durable material and they have not responded. Buyer beware.If anyone does have the original 18/10 version (inked Ginko and 18/10 logo on the rear face of the untensil) please let me know as I would like to purchase a set.
5,Still Beautiful Tableware a Year Later...,"I received 8 place settings as a Christmas gift from my husband in 2006. This pattern is so beautiful I immediately went online to Amazon to order the steak knives, 2 hostess sets, the accessory set and an additional 4 place settings to round it out to 12. The design is a one of kind and I love the balance. They just feel good in your hand. I have never experienced any of the rust problems reported buy a couple of others reviewers. They will scratch with normal wear, but this really doesn't detract from the overall beauty.We went to dinner recently at a local high end restaurant and we were surprised to see they set their tables with this pattern.For Christmas 2007, my husband completed my Lafayette collection with the serving bowls, salt & pepper shakers, napkin rings, tray and water pitcher.Go for it! You won't be disappointed."
3,Nice for the price,"I already have a set that I purchased at a department store over a year ago. I like it so much, I wanted to add more to what I already have. Unfortunately, these pieces look like they may have been the ""rejects"". The pieces are to have a nice ""hammered"" look...of the ones I just purchased, some pieces have that look, and some look almost completely smooth. But for the price, I cannot complain too much, but it would have been nice to have a nice uniform looking set. This was the last set available, so I couldn't get an exhange, so I kept them. Being they were the last set is probably why they were the ""rejects""."
3,SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED,"I AM USE TO THE INFORMATION CONVEIED IN THE 'DETAIL' BOOKS AND WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THE DETAILS WERE NOT LABELLED AND IF THEY WERE THERE WAS NO KEY PROVIDED UNLESS THEY WERE IMBEDDED IN THE IMAGE OF THE DETAIL ITSELF. THEY SEEMED TO BE CUT & PASTED FROM SOURCES.ALSO A BIT EXPENSIVE FOR A SOFTCOVER 'IN DETAIL BUILDING SKINS' IS THE SAME PRICE, MORE INDEPTH, THICKER ...AND PART OF THE DETIAL PUBLICATION SERIES."
3,Some design flaws,The pocket clip is way under powered for the weight of the knife. Also the torx screws holding it on are too small. Sharp contours on the hinge end of the knife are uncomfortable in your pocket to say the least. The blade design is awesome. Great cutting force. Would not buy again though
4,nice,"this was my first Spyderco knife. I bought it since I am rough on knives and this is a relatively affordable knife to test its durability. the construction is sleek, with no visible screws or pins and the blade is sharp. This knife is on the larger side but still fits nicely in the hand.the only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the blade when closed does not sit very deep in the handle. This makes for a rather wide closed knife that takes up more pocket space then necessary. That may or may not bother some people.all in all it's solid, feels good in the hand, and very sharp. not bad for their value line of knives made in china."
5,TEN STARS!,"I received a Spyderco Harpy w/a serrated edge as a gift a few years ago & it has served me well.But lately I wanted something along the same line but a little larger with a plain edge and good quality without it costing me a bundle of cash.I looked and compared different hawkbill knives. I even inspected the Cold Steel Black Talon (a local store had it for $400.00 which is ridiculous because I found it to be not up to what you usually expect and receive when you buy something from Cold Steel. Maybe that's why they stopped producing them. I own a few of their knives and have no complaints).I saw the Byrd Crossbill from Spyderco and eventhough it's made in China decided to buy it because I was hoping it lived up to the standards of Spyderco.I""M HAPPY I DID. It's a great knife. A little larger than The Harpy, very sharp and well made yet not unwieldy.If you are looking for a good sturdy and well made hawkbill knife at a great price this is the one for you."
5,Lovely!!!,"This knife is absolutely lovely. I use it for opening packages, picking difficult things off, slicing paper (Especially cardboard), stabbing, etc."
4,nice knife,"this is a very nice knife for the money.the only thing i didnt like was it is a little stiff to open when you first get it,i put a few drops of gun oil around the blade where it opens and it is better."
5,Works like a charm,"Ever since he was born he's had troubles latching on, the doctor gave us one of these to help and it was the only way he would eat. well our dog got ahold of it and torn it apart!!!!! we needed one and fast that's why we thank god for amazon and overnight shipping."
5,Nipple SAVER!,"I have really large areolas. I breastfed both of my children, and they could not possibly get the entire areola into their mouth while latching on. So with both babies, I had horrible sore, cracked, bleeding nipples. These nipple shields SAVED me! I was able to breast feed both of my children for well over a year, alternating between using the shield and not (eventually not having to use it anymore once my nipples toughened up). I swear by these things. They are a MUST!"
1,to big didnt work,this product did not fit me wright seemed like it fall off all the time. did not care for this product
2,This is a song,"I bought this book thinking that it was a little bit more than the song ""Wear Sunscreen."" This book is only The words to the song. It is a great book, I just wanted to make sure that you knew that it is the words to the song and nothing else."
5,I need lots of sunscreen,"I sat through two commencement speeches, myself. Never did I pay attention to not one of them! But I'm sure if I did they would of made lots of sense to me as this book does now. Great read!"
2,mistitled CD,"This is past their darker, more industrial (and I think better) period and a much more pop album. All the lyrics are in English this time and they are going for hits. Similar to SPK's foray into pop/dance territory with similarly unsatisfying results, though this era seems to be very popular with the German kids.The group is actually called ""X-Mal Deutschland, and the CD is called, ""Devils."""
4,A Great Buy,"This is definitely a no frills CD--no liner notes, no recording information--the list of tracks on the back cover is even white lettering on a yellow background so it's almost impossible to read--and the front cover has an inane picture of cats on it that is wholly unnecessary. If you can get past all that, however, this is an amazing CD--2 great prewar Ella tracks, Fats Waller's ""Honeysuckle Rose"", the ""Casa Loma Stomp,"" and Joe Venuti's ""Stringin' the Blues,"" maybe the greatest jazz violin track ever. If you're already a jazz fan, you may have a lot of the standards on here, but even if there's only one or two tracks that you're looking for, you cannot beat the price. This is a great CD to stick in the player and leave on repeat."
4,Around the World with John Stott,"This is a delightful and colorful (though brief) book in which Christian statesman John RW Stott shares memories of his world travels (along with beautiful photos) and highlights 17 people whose lives have influenced his own. Some are people Stott met, others are persons whose lives touched his in some way. Among those featured are Richard Wurmbrand, Mohandas Gandhi, Hudson Taylor, Ernest Shackleton, and D.L Moody, along with others. Stott's own engaging personality shines through the pages.Michael Duduit, Editor, Preaching magazinewww.preaching.com"
4,looks nice,these look nice on my blue car. one of the screws has fallen out of the holder but thats probably due to the subs rattling the hell out of it.
2,Looks Bigger in Picture,"Should have read the description in more detail. There are several bags of popping corn, but they are quiet small. This is a Christmas Gift, so maybe once I have given this gift, I will have a chance to sample the popcorn. Might be worth the price after all?"
2,"Interesting, but not very useful","This book contains a number of interesting meditations and reflections on marathon running. And viewed as such, it's a nice book to have. But the substantive guidlines on how to train are poorly lacking. There are some general guidlines and a few charts you can use to chart your progress, but there is little beyond that (e.g., about nutrition)."
5,Put it in your collection,"For a collector of Cash, this one is a gem, only if your getting started, you may want to buy one of his concerts at Folsom Prison or San Quentin. The sound quality on this disc isn't excellent, though considering the times in which these recordings were made, it is atmospheric. This is a ""fun"" album filled with laughter, cheering and music. A good one to put in your collection."
3,Too many versions,"I'm not rating, I'm ranting. I'm upset that there are so many versions of the album, each including different 'bonus' tracks depending on where you purchase the it. Why does it matter where I buy it, I just want all of the songs they record."
1,Buddy Greene's version of Broken Road 10 times better!,"For those of you enthralled with the song Bless the Broken Road, pick up Buddy Greene's Sinner's and Saints from 5 YEARS AGO. He sang it with a lot more feeling and better instumentation.Buddy Greene is a REAL CHRISTIAN BLUEGRASS/COUNTRY/FOLK artist that you will never hear on the radio.....he also plays a mean harmonica.The boys from Rascal Flack haven't lived long enough to walk the broken road.....who broke their hearts?...Their prom dates?...Their agent? Don't believe the hype!"
5,Favorite CD,"Rascal Flatts' newest CD, ""Feels Like Today"", is easily my favorite CD I own. I have not been a big fan of country music for very long. In fact, I was introduced to this group only about a year ago. However, since then they have been my favorite group, and I am planning on going to their concert in December.I think the reason I like this group so much is the ability to relate to their lyrics. ""Bless the Broken Road"" is my favorite song because of the message behind it. Their music provides an emotional connection between the lyrics and listener. For me, it provides hope for a future filled with love and happiness. I don't think I'll ever regret purchasing this CD, as I love every song on it and often listen to the entire disc multiple times a day."
5,Refreshing,"If your craving some good new music this is your band. They may have a bit of teeny bop edge, but it is a nice change. I like Fast Cars and Freedom the best. But many well written songs on this album. Enjoy it. Finally some good new music in a world of MTV noise. Go get it."
3,Yeahhh Rascal Flats II,"Like this album. Not crazy about everything on it, but hey, that's just the way it is. I will eventually buy more R.F. music."
4,Not a country lover,"My husband is and turned me on to these guys. The vocals and harmonizing are just amazing. Very reminiscent of the Eagles. This album is absolutely sensational. As I stated, I am sooooooooo not a country music lover. Having said that, there are several standout tracks on this CD. Holes is not only poignant but has astounding vocals.Gary Levox's vocals are true and steady (even live by the way). Even if you don't like country, do yourself a favor and invest in this CD. It's hard NOT to appreciate it."
4,Good CD,"Rascal Flatts always delivers a good, solid CD with lots of great songs. This is no exception."
1,dont get this,rascal flatts is not country in my opinion. if this is where all of countrys goin then im not gonna listen to country anymore. i dont think this is worth your money
2,Feels Like Teen Spirit,"Ok - I don't get the Rascal Flatts thing. If anyone can explain it to me, I am more than willing to pay a handsome reward. A reward that's almost as handsome as the devilishly handsome rogues of Rascal Flatts!One other thing - people, please hear me out. I know nothing about the music, but the name ""Rascal Flatts"" is the DUMBEST name of a group of any kind I have ever heard. Whoever came up with it needs to be fired."
1,DON'T BUY THIS !,the Patch has a rough back that hurts my forehead. i have to wear the hat backwards of i get a big red spot and look like a tool. its really poorly made. DON'T BUY
3,Average quality,"5 stars for creativity2 stars for qualityMy Old Navy beanie ($6) has better quality than this.But I do show this beanie to friends and coworkers, they all impressed. I do recommend this beanie - if you are a world of warcraft fan."
1,Rancid,"Had these on a subscribe and save plan and the last batch that shipped were rancid. It looks as though the expiration date is November 2006, but I don't know if that's right, it just says ""06 NOV"". Expired or not, these were bad."
3,Not enough peanut butter,These are not as good as other ones I've tried. Too much hard cookie and very thin layer of filling.
1,bad batch maybe...gross!,"I am not sure if I grew out of liking the taste of these or if I got a bad shipment/batch, but these tasted horrible! It had a hint of peanut butter taste and then a dull cookie crunch. Not even sweet...but more like a salty cookie."
2,Will live without this item.,"Ordered this on a whim thru subscribe & save. Cookies were not quality item. Crumbled, stale and overall the taste varied from cookie to cookie. Discontinued the order. Will not hold Amazon accountable for this. They could not know the contents of this package. Beware of Subscribe & Save......Have never been satisfied with any items placed on this procedure."
5,It Kills,"Though I am normally suspicious of compilations, anthems and such, you will not miss with Clubber's Guide 2002. At first I thought it was good, but nothing innovative...But then, let me put it this way; I was listening to the first disc at the gym a few days ago, and CG2002 was so good that I almost CRIED..."
5,great product!,great product i have used it only once butit worked great!i would recomend this to my friends.my wife likes it too!
5,Very nice,"This is very fun. If your a little raw at all or you just want a little more fun use a little and tada, instant wet. Not too much wet but enough that your not raw after your done. Will totally need some more soon."
1,bad taste,"This is not tasty at all, actually a gross chemical taste. Lube is decent, no greasy but drys up easily if there is a fan on or the heater is on."
2,Product was not as presented,"This was presented as two small bottles,and I chose it because I wanted a small bottle for travel: I received a single large bottle (same net contents as would have been in the two smaller bottles. Product itself was no better or worse than others I have tried."
4,Great,"This is a great collectors' item for people who loved the movie as much as I did. That being said this toy isn't very flexible, so it is not meant for play and should be viewed as a display item ONLY. The crow that you place on his shoulder is incredibly delicate and will snap clean off if you try to mount it on his shoulder with too much force.I love the action figure for its appearance and use it for spicing up the decor of my desk."
4,Go into it with an open mind.,"There is no doubt in reading the book that Mr. Brummett is truthfully recounting his experiences, but those going into the book believing it to be hogwash will likely not be convinced otherwise. An excellent read if able to go into the book with the ability to take his accounts for what they are said to be."
1,The worst game I've ever played,"This game appears to have been made by amateurs in a little less than 24 hours. Terrible 3D models. Stop and go controls. It was embarrassing to play this game when it was first released in the 1990s, and it's just as bad now."
2,Too Hokey,"While I am a big fan of medical thrillers, I couldn't get into this one. The small town in which the book takes place is steeped in both religious fundamentalism and superstition. One day, a faith healer comes to town and cures a paralyzed young woman but others who received her ""special treatment"" begin to develop seizures. After a van slams into a pole, two women are rescued and their bodies tell the tale of severe abuse, but they can't communicate beyond strange chanting, symbols and a frightening, voodoo-like doll in their possession. Rhea struggles to determine if dark magic forces are at work or if these events can be explained by science."
3,Good as a first book period.,This book will be informative for the beginner and a great reference for the intermediate. Do NOT buy this book if you have ever been formally trained in AutoCAD or have read any real books - just more of the SOS.
5,NEED INFO ASAP!,Does anyone know if the cdrom included in this package is a trial version of autocad lt or the full version?PLEASE HELP!
5,Product & Customer Service - AAA+++ (Amazon Verified Purchase),The items sold by this store are of the highest quality. I also must comment that the Customer Service Department of SilverSpoon Store is incredible. I ordered the wrong pattern of silverware and they were incredibly helpful in resolving the issue. They went above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you SilverSpoon Store -- I look forward to doing business with you in the future.
1,"I haven't seen this, but thank you for letting me know.","Dude, This collection has 4 of the best MA movies THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN, but I really wanted to thank you for pointing this out that they would not play, that is a god damn shame considering I would do anythign to see the deaf-mute heroine, cotton mill, and TIGER OVER WALL with Hwang Lee and Phillip Ko. So if somebody can protect this somehow, I will pay $40 for this collection."
3,Reasonable,"It is a great, simple cover. Only problem is that you have to sew it together. It is kind of a pain but it looks sleek if you do it right."
5,This is the absolute best tasting candy...I love it!,If you like gummie worms then you are going to love these...I eat these things weekly
4,California singer-songwriter with heart and style,"I have been a fan of Laurie Lewis for 20 years, when I first heard her playing bass and singing with the Good Ol' Persons. She continues to amaze me with her versatility, her depth and her heart. Some of her songs are about love, life, and other universals, some about specifics in her life,about home and her own experiences. Esp. treats in this album are""Kiss Me Before I Die"" written after a serous accident in '94 and 3 cuts with Kathy Kallick singing harmony. Laurie is a superb fiddle player - she also is backed by very talented people, including the incomparable Nina Gerber. The only reason this isn't a ""5"" for me is that I do have a favorite Lewis song - and that was already recorded years ago."
4,Kids love it!,"The magnets are crowding the scene a bit, but the kids really love arranging and opening a new door each day. It serves the purpose that I hoped it would in telling them the story of Jesus' birth. With each day we talk about each magnet's purpose at the manger. They really do look forward to opening them every morning (they are both preschoolers), and hopefully this will be exciting to them around Christmas for many more years."
4,Great quality - Really good for younger,This is an extremely well done product. The painting is nice and it looks great. It is really for younger children. There is nothing else that makes it stand out! I liked it a lot!
4,Not As Pictured,"Overall, we've been happy with this advent nativity we bought at a brick and mortar store. It's very nice quality and we even received good (but slow) customer service from the MFR.However, we were misled by the images here and on the box. The 24 pieces are LARGER than shown and there isn't quite room for all of them in the scene. It gets very crowded around 12/18. Yet there's another week to go."
5,Very high quality -- worth every penny,"I almost didn't buy this product because it was so much more expensive than some of the others, but I'm glad I did. When I received it, I realized that this is an advent calendar that will be in our family for generations. It is high quality, good craftsmanship. The little figures are wooden with magnets on the back that 'stick' to the metal manger scene. Each figure is painted in detail, and this year my daughter had a wonderful time examining each of them as I told her their role in the Christmas story. This is a wonderful product to add to your family Christmas traditions."
5,THE BEST ADVENT CALENDAR OUT THERE,"I have been searching for an advent calendar for two years now. I love love love this one. It has 24 magnets for each day with a little extra space that you could add a suggestion for a service or activity....ie. make cookies for a family or drive around and look at the lights. Very very well made. Great detail on the magnets of animals, shepards, and wisemen, ect. Quality work. So great I bought another one for my sister. You can place it on the table free standing or hand it on the wall. I was extremely pleased when I received this. YOU WILL LOVE IT."
3,not happy,"The quality for the price paid was very disappointing. The ""wood"" is flimsy and the magnets are cheap and feel like they were made in China...maybe they were"
3,check the numbers...,"When the calendar arrived i was quite pleased and happy with the quality. Then I realized that the numbers were incorrect. The number 21 was missing and in its place was a duplicate 24. I guess this is because this product is made in China. So had to return it because it could not be easily repaired / fixed without looking terrible. Amazon shipped a replacement 1 day shipping but UPS got lazy and didn't deliver it for another 3 days, after Advent had already begun. Bottom line, the Kurt Adler company makes a very nice product but there needs to be better Quality Control!"
2,Not as Nice as I thought,"I am wondering if there are 2 versions of this calendar that are being reviewed. One Five Star review said the manger scene had ""raised tin portions that gives it a 3D appearance"". Well, not the one that I got! I paid around $50 for it so I guess I am satisfied for the money but in no way is it a great deal. It looks like it is mass produced in China which is says right on the box. Also, there is no stand so you sort of have to lean it on something or it will fall over."
2,Not worth the price tag,"I decided to purchase this Nativity Advent Calendar after reading several of the positive reviews. Many made mention of how the nativity backdrop was metal and painted with vibrant colors. This is no longer the case, as the one I received is just a printed out paper nativity scene glued to the inside of the box. The company obviously decided to cut some costs, cheapening the quality of the product."
2,Cute Product - Poor Quality Control,"I received this product with an extra Angel (horn) and no Mary! Kind of hard to have a nativiy scence without Mary, she is kind-of important. Contacted the Manufactuer to see if I can simply do a Angel for Mary swap. They declined and stated that I must return the entire product to the retailer. December is just a few days away, so I will be without an Advent calendar as I am sending this one back."
1,Book with many mistakes and poor topics,"I have been looking for a good introductory reference in Mixed-Signal testing so I can recommend it to the entery level test engineers and co-ops. I totally agree with the previos reader, I am very disappointed. In contrary, I recommend "" An Introduction to Mixed-Signal IC test and Measurement"" by Mark Burns and Gordon W. Roberts and admire their contribution in their bood to the field of semiconductor testing.A senior Product/Test Engineer"
3,Disappointing,After L. A. and other great efforts Hiroshima looses steam with this effort. While the album is not bad it does lack the energy of the previous efforts. A three-year mountain of waiting has produced a molehill of sound. This album is only for the most rabid fans of the group other should steer clear and spend there hard earned cash somewhere else.
1,Didn't get what I wanted,"I ordered this cd and got the Bridges cd instead. That would not have been so bad, except the case was cracked and the cd smudged."
2,Otherwise Known As Sheila the Great,"Judy Blume. I remember that book when I was in about, fourth grade. This book is a bit more sophisticated than that, but not much. If you haven't read that one, how about, ""Are you there God, it's me, Margaret"". Same kind of feel. I'm not saying this book didn't get my attention. It's easy, a page turner, and could be entertaining for some. If you were ever in a sorority, you might get a few laughs. I don't recommend this book to anyone that is a male out there. I don't want to sound too harsh, but if you've ever read a book, and feel really good that you've finished it and can't wait to start another- this book makes you want to start another. However, I don't feel too good about having read it. Maybe it's for a college age person (or younger), but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend because I'd be embarassed that I just read a book like this. It's Days of our Lives meets 90210 in the South. How's that?"
1,This got published!,"During the first few chapters I thought I had stumbled upon an edgy, post-modern piece of literature. As a girl in the south I liked the concept of such a screaming, no holds-barred look at the vast superficiality of the culture. (dramatized, of course) But what I got was a bunch of trash. The ending was a joke (were we supposed to care or be mildly surprised? THAT was what the whole book was leading to?) and the plot had no point. It just kept going (maybe it was supposed to be funny?) until it abruptly, and unrealistically, ended. Skip it, and don't by any means pay full price. Truly the worst book I have read in a long time."
4,Good Stuff,"I have read many books lately, but this one was by far one of the most amusing. I am not one to usually take the time to write my thoughts on something, but this book is worth it. I think the book was easy, fast reading. I hope Helen M. Ellis writes more books like this one!"
4,Gripping,"I loved this book. I picked it up and read it in 2 days! It's catty, appauling, psychotic and emotional. I hated putting it down."
2,Judge This One By Its Cover,"Sometimes you really can judge a book by its cover. Had I paid closer attention to the goldfish in the blender on the cover of ""Eating the Cheshire Cat: A Novel"" I doubt I would have read any further. As a Southener and fan of many Southern authors, I was intrigued with the blurbs on the backcover and expected to meet quirky characters. Instead of being engrossed, I was thoroughly grossed out with Sarina, Nicole and their misguided mothers. Reading this book was like looking at a bloody accident when you don't want to see the gore but your eyes are drawn to it anyway. Yet, I read it in one sitting. This novel was fascinating horror at its best. Thankfully I borrowed the book from the public library and didn't waste my money, only my time!"
4,good read,"this book is easy to read and quick too, I finished it in three days. the story was interesting and unexpected. It was the best book I've read in a long time."
1,BLAH,"This was a trite, insipid book written as a last-go-at-it novel. It's no Valley of the Dolls or Bell Jar (neither of which I highly recommend, although they come off A-list compared to this trash). Basically you have a story about Southern girls. And not just any Southern girls. Inflated, dull, outlandish, boringly stupid and gratingly catty caricatures of what the ""modern day sorority Southern princess"" is. Basically this is one of the novels an Alabama girl writes because she can't write about anything else except what she knows, and then she doesn't even have any idea what she's talking about. This book aims to offend Southern girls with its catty depiction of college life and fat chicks, but the only one going to be offended is anyone with taste. The book is purely a pain in the a** to read and won't be enjoyed by anyone besides Talladega graduates who fondly remember hazings. B-movie material. The camp is bad, and the ending is worth mocking."
2,It has potential,"This book has the potential to be truly great. I enjoy it's dark humor quality, but the cliche ending is a disapointment."
3,Not how the South really is!,"This novel certainly kept my attention and brought about quite a few laughs, but having been brought up in Tuscaloosa and having lived in the South my entire life, I have NEVER met people as inhuman as the women she describes. Many of their character traits are recognizable, but they are surely grotesque exaggerations. I hope other readers don't expect to find these people in Alabama. Highly entertaining."
1,a waste of paper,"This book sounded intriguing. The reviews were good. So I bought it. This is the most irritating, uninteresting, and unrealistic book I have ever read. I did not find it humorous or exciting. I enjoyed the first 30 pages or so, but it was all downhill after that. I felt like slapping all of the characters. There is no real heroine here, even in the meek Bitty Jack. You will pity her more than you will love her.Do not waste your money. I beg of you."
3,"I was bored, so....","I was bored at school, so I thought I'd write this review cause I just like to criticize. Although I haven't finished reading the book yet (I'm on p.188) so far I can say it's an addictive book but not exactly the best I've read. I think the author needs to describe more the emotions of the characters and their appearance in general; I can't get a good picture of these girls in my mind. The author mostly just tells the events but doesn't really stop the narrative too often to just write about the characters' feelings. The result is a set of barely-developed characters that seem to be supreme goodness or pure evil and are very one-dimensional. It therefore becomes hard to identify with any of the girls. On the other hand, the book tackles some very important issues like self-mutilation and abusive relationships. It seems sort of predictable that Sarina will probably end up on the bottom in the end because the author trains us to hate her."
4,Twisted...but funny,"Helen Ellis' debut novel is fantastic. Right from the first chapter you're drawn into the sick world that these women live and it makes you cringe at the twisted-ness of it...but at the same time, it makes you hyper aware of all the things we do do to ourselves to be pretty, popular and loved. Why they might not be nearly as extreme as the antics in this novel, Ellis shows us how far it could really go if we aren't kept in check"
5,"This, by far, is one of the best books I have ever read!","Eating the Cheshire Cat is one of the best books I have ever read. It is the definition of a page-turner. I read it in less than one day, which is an accomplishment for me, I must admit. I could do nothing but put everything aside for 24-hours to finish it. It's like reading gossip, for crying out loud! But the most intriguing aspect of the novel is its focus on the southern culture of young high school and college aged women. It is almost a perfect mirror image of what society consists of in the south, especially Greek life. I love this book, everyone I know loves this book. YOU WOULD LOVE THIS BOOK."
5,This is one popularity contest you don't want to miss!,"Meet Sarina--cheerleader, sorority girl, ""Miss Popularity"" and yes...Satan in heels! She's the girl you love to hate! You'll pity Sarina's friends and boyfriends as Sarina struggles to claw her way to the top! Don't worry though, you'll love her sweet lil' rival, Bitty Jack. You'll feel an amalgam of emotions as you read this devilishly entertaining satire! And you don't even have to be a Southerner to enjoy this novel! Helen Ellis writes for everyone in her brilliant debut! If you like movies like ""Jawbreaker"" or ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", you'll LOVE this book!"
4,Very entertaining and worth recommending to friends!,"Loved it, purchased it saturday morning and finished it saturday night. Things were very much on the mark. Having lived in Tuscaloosa for over 20 years, I could visualize all the landmarks that were mentioned. And I can honestly say that I knew mothers and daughters like the characters in the book, some that actually attended Central among other schools. Very entertaining and colorful characters, however, Johnny's comings and goings were kind of brief and unexpected. But Kudos to you Ms. Ellis, job well done."
5,"A Wonderful, Dark Read!",Are popularity contests simple? I doubt you'd think so after reading this book. I was hooked from page one. This is a great exploration of southern culture and the down-side of raising children who value beauty and popularity over all else. Highly recommended!
3,"Campy. Dark. Stereotypical - hey, it's FICTION, folks!","Oh, the joys of being a Southern sorority alumna! You are the women everyone loves to hate. Thanks! ;) Even in a couple of the reviews on here, I've read some catty remarks. But, as a good lady does, I'll just smile my Cheshire Cat smile and read on... :DAnyway, ""Eating the Cheshire Cat"" was one of my summer reads this season. Sure, it was a fun, easy read...total fiction of course. This is in the same genre as Heathers or Jawbreaker, except I didn't really shed any tears reading this book. (Not that I remember crying at those movies, either.)This certainly is no literary masterpiece - like I said, it's just a fun read. If you were in a sorority (esp. Tri Delt) or went to college in the South (esp. Bama), then you will get an extra shudder of joy/familiarity/embarrassment? because you can relate to the setting of this story."
2,Pretty Disappointed,"This book is definatly not for someone trying to learn to use Maya on the PC. The biggest disappointment is not the book but the CD-ROM. There are no tutorial files for the PC on it, as the book was sent to market without them. The PC tutorials are available at the publishers website. It is over 250 MB in size so if you have dial-up be prepared to spend alot of time downloading. Many of the chapters tutorials are not complete either. The quick-start and chapter 6 on texturing are two that I've found so far as I'm still downloading. Over-all this book has now cost me much more than it is worth due to time downloading and then finding incomplete files. Wiley publishing does not indicated that they will send you a replacement CD-ROM on the site. Without the CD the book is really hard to follow."
3,what a delusion,I really look into getting this book but I got very disappointed at the end. It convers a lot of topics and it promises lots of tutorials that usually are superficial.This book helps to horient yourself through many functionalities in Maya but it keeps you to a level that you could get with just the online help found in the software.Not to mention the terrible support for the buggy CD under windows OS
2,"not impressed, kids were bored","The art is not as stunning as in some other recent titles, but certain design elements are unique and make for an interesting composition. I encountered resistance when reading this story to my kindergarten class. They lost interest when I reached the historical information on the right side of the book. It was an interesting idea to incorporate the true facts of Juan's life, but I think the structure and layout of the story suffers from this dense presentation of facts. As for the poetry, I would have been more impressed by an original voice and rhythm uniquely suited to its Mexican subject and setting, and not borrowed from a Classic nursery rhyme."
3,A Flawed Presentation,"The intentions of this book are good: to introduce children to Juan Quezada of the village of Mata Ortiz, Mexico. Juan taught himself how to make pottery much like the pottery that disappeared from the Mata Ortiz area 500 or so years ago. He found potsherds in the ground and studied them. He learned about clay. He learned about shaping. He learned about painting designs on the pot. All of this is interesting and also important for children to know.But the book seems to be two books cobbled together: a left-hand page that uses a distinctly English cumulative story (the house that Jack built), and a right-hand page that gives facts about pottery. The two pages don't work together and one doesn't know whether to read all the left-hand pages first, then all the right-hand pages, or what. Reading the right-hand pages after reading each left-hand page interrupts the jack-built story.In my opinion, this book does not work."
4,Clay Changed the Community,A beautiful pictorial look at pottery art in Mexico. The connection that Juan has to pottery and nature is shown in the book. I liked the afterward that gives readers more background information about Juan and the pottery making process he used. I enjoyed the illustrations that show how Juan used natural elements surrounding him to create his art.
2,not a good seller,"The pictures are very nice. But as other reviewers have said, the structure and layout is fatally flawed and the writing style more appealing to adults who grew up knowing ""The House that Jack Built"". I'm finding it's not a popular seller. As a bookstore owner, I'm also finding that the publishing industry is more and more out of touch with consumer demand. That even goes for many of these smaller companies. Lee & Low, I admire your multicultural aim, but shake up your editorial dept. please! Many of your books are too similar, the writing trite and stilted. Do more humor, go deeper, be more original in style and content!"
4,God's Master Builders,"page 187 - God's Master BuildersPaul abruptly changes the metaphor from God's field to God's building (I Cor. 3:9). Paul's ministry and ours is to be God's master builders. The word Paul uses is 'architecton'. A 'tekton' is a carpenter, but an 'architecton' is the craftsman who serves as the architect, contractor and engineer.Great nuggets of information. Buy it!!"
2,Buy at Target,"Good bin, bad price online. I just bought a couple of these from Target for $5 apiece."
1,Never received this book!,"Ordered this on the first of June '06, Amazon sent it twice to my old address even though I entered my new address when I placed my order. So....I wouldn't have the slightest idea how to review this book. Amazon's site makes it so difficult to report the problem, but so easy to go in circles on their site....I gave up and tried to get my message across to them in THIS venue."
2,It prints fast and the output is OK,"The printer does what you need and the $250 cost is less than the cost of replacing the supplies.The problem is the noise. You have all these cartridges rotating around and it makes lots of noise.If you have it in a office environment its ok, however it's in my den and the noise is to much. The worst part is that it will cycle every few hours and wake any guest sleeping in the room.For a home environment I would suggest the 2600N. It uses a different system and makes little noise. It can also be directly connected to a network which is a big plus. The N stands for network."
2,Keep Looking,This book is a take off on a real event at the end of World War Two dealing with holocaust loot captured by the allies. That is about the nicest thing I can say about the book. It was really trying to get up to the average mark but it did not make it. Overall it was just dull.
1,Ever Call Ready,"I thought I would expand my listening by ordering this CD, as I have listened to music the Musicians performed on in the past, with success. Not this CD. This is religious to a fault. It is church rock and performed with no real meaning. What a combination, religious music that sucks. No thank you for this stuff. But, if you are a zealot who wants his superstition in everything in your life, go for it. Maybe they are saved, but they should save it for Sunday School. Pitiful and hokey."
4,"Toshiba 19"" TV","Great shipping.Terrific picture.Instructions for antennae hook-up could have been a little better....still no problem. Again, picture better than most!Price similar to local discount stores."
4,Toshiba TV,The shipping was excellent and the TV worked right out of the box with east set-up. The only problem was a faulty remote that we ended up replacing with a universal remote instead of hasselling with sending it back.
5,Wonderful music for worship,"I LOVE this book. I can grab it and play quite a number of the pieces well. If you want to hear some of the music or buy a CD of the music, go to the arranger's website at www.markhayes.com."
5,An Excellent Product,I purchased this item for my wife for Christmas. The selections are arranged beautifully - a definite must for those who play the piano and appreciate fine Christian music.
5,Recommended reading for home buyers,"I recommend Dan's book as a no-nonsense guide to getting your money's worth when buying a house, condo, townhouse, or co-op apartment. He tells you what to look for -- and what to watch out for -- as you choose an agent, lender, title company, and other professionals. He clearly explains the real estate process in terms that consumers can understand. Whether you are working through a real estate agent or directly with sellers, this book is a useful tool for cutting through the legal mumbo-jumbo that surrounds the biggest purchase of your life. Highly recommended reading for home buyers."
5,great hose,This hose works great as a replacement for the original hose on my Rigid vac from home depot. it fits perfect and is long enough to actually use as opposed to the 5' long factory hose.
5,Of Honor and Dishonor,"Thinking this would be a book only men would appreciate, I was pleasantly surprised. David Crocco's down-to-earth, candid writing style provides a unique opportunity for women and men alike to see through the eyes of a West Point Cadet during a tumultuous period of American history. A great story!"
3,independent comedy has its moments,"Independent films are one of the few places left to look for original material, studio Hollywood being slavishly devoted to (safer) sequels. That being said, this particular low-budget piece borrowed much of its premise from the mainstream ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills.""From the outset, you have to suspend disbelief a little to swallow the idea that young, good looking, intelligent, and well-dressed Will Stewart can't get a job and is so down on his luck as to be reduced to panhandling. Additionally, it seems the part was written for a black character, since all of Stewart's friends are black. But if you can get past that, the movie is very well acted and compulsively watchable. It ends with a whimper rather than a bang, but that is because the filmmakers seemed to want to hang on to realism rather than embrace the fantasy trajectory of the movie."
5,"Nice set of levels, 59"" very useful","I was on the fence about a 59"" level since it obviously won't fit into the area's a 4ft level just make it. More importantly it'll span those areas that a 4ft is just too short; first day I had them I needed to plum windows from 2nd floor to first floor and the 59"" level could reach where a 4ft couldn't have. The fluid in the bubbles is a bright green which makes it easier to read the level's in dim lit areas."
5,Good Movie! The Unmasking Scene is Incredible!,I have this Phantom of the Opera movie on video and it was the first silent movie I ever saw and I think it's great and I highly recommend it! The scene where Christine pulls off the Phantom's mask is incredible! And Lon Chaney is absolutely fantastic as the Phantom!
1,Tunnel,"As an avid reader of mysteries and thrillers, I was amazed at how bad this book was. I read at least two novels per week (I am retired) and this ranks among the five worst novels that I have read. The story has been done at least a hundred times before, and the writing was very poor. It seemed like the writer was double parked and was in a hurry. It must have been written with a screenplay in mind because it certainly was not a good read."
4,TUNNEL - A passage of crime and terror,"When the cold war ends, Soviet bloc spies in the United States turn their attention and skills to crimes - robbing banks, killing innocent people and hostage taking. Hiding behind the political pretense of the so-called Beirut Brigade, the thugs move their operation to the Big Apple for one last big heist. But the Joint Task Force on Terrorism has an adversary the Brigade did not count on: Jake Malloy, a New York cop and Navy ex-Seal with a gun, strong instincts, and a belief in the Golden Rule. Malloy puts the clues together from the various crime scenes and hunts the bad guys down in a climatic ending. TUNNEL is action packed from start to finish, and does not let you come up for air until the end."
1,Tunnel a deep hole of a story,"What was Walt doing while writing this story? Why didn't he bother reviewing what he wrote? It seems he decided to have Tunnel published before he was even done writing it!Sure, it's a great story idea, the first 10 times it was used, but so much was left out, dropped, left unexplained or glossed over, it seems Wager cared less about his story or us, the readers.His characters, Gunther, Mirror, ""the woman with the fake southern accent and excellent sexual skills"" (could he at least given her a name?!), seem to be characters in a TV commercial, that's how much their actions and motivations make sense.If Wager had spent an extra weekend going through his story and cleaned it up some, it could have made an excellent ""Charlie's Angels"" episode."
4,Excellent P.I. tale about Football crazed town,"After P.I. Bill Smith helps his nephew Gary avoid police custody, Gary takes off. Bill and his partner, Lydia Chin, set out to find him. Their investigation leads to New Jersey, where the town of Warrenstown is all about football. Once a girl was raped at a party and one of the football players was suspected until a nerdy kid committed suicide. It seems as though the football players can do no wrong, as long as they win. Gary is new to Warrenstown, but his father, Bill's brother-in-law isn't. He grew up there, and he know its secrets. This book was a great look into the past and the nature of a town that thrives on football. The sense of humor was original, and I can't wait to read another in the series."
5,Bill's latest story,"SJ Rozan is the author of the Lydia Chin/Bill Smith mystery series. They're unique in that each new book alternates point of view. For example, Winter and Night is narrated by Bill Smith. The previous book, Reflecting the Sky, was narrated by Lydia. Bill and Lydia are polar opposites which makes for lots of dramatic tension. But, as far as I'm concerned, the dialogue is the best part of the book. Rozan's dialogue is at least as good as Elmore Leonard's. Maybe better.Anyway, if you haven't read this series, you really should give it a chance. Robert Crais (another great mystery writer) says Rozan ""paints with the full palette of the human heart, using depth, detail, and nuance of character that I haven't seen since Raymond Chandler. (Yes, I mean it.)"""
3,Disappointing for an Edgar winner,"This is my first Rozan mystery. Her writing style is a cut above many other mystery writers, but overall, I was disappointed. The Bill/Lydia relationship was not well developed (perhaps that's her style) and was one dimensional. I was also expecting some development of the Warrentown-is-a-terrible-place theme. That message came through comments by Smith, Lydia, and some loner kids. What about the townspeople?"
4,Deserved winner,"While not having the opportunity (yet) to read all of this books competition, it is easy to see how this won the Edgar Award for the best novel. The author's prose flows like one of the lands great rivers and certainly she is a professional with great talent. This is a must read."
1,good book horrible ebook version,"I have been reading the whole series and have really enjoyed the alternating points of view. Great series, BUT. this ebook is riddled with editting issues and is nearly unreadable due to the way the dialogue displays in the kindle version. Add to that the fact that I knew who the 'problem' character was from the beginning while Bill didn't seem able to get the obvious foreshadowing, and this definitely wasn't the best. I hate messed up ebooks, because it shows that they just did something with a computer and didn't bother to read the result. For pete sake, if I have to pay real book prices, I should get real book editting."
3,OK...,"My second read by this author. First was ""Absent Friends"". Pretty good story. Too much use of the ""f-word"". Many formatting errors in the Kindle version."
3,thoughtful suspense,"A more thoughtful suspense novel than most in that everything is not tightly wrapped up at the end. In a town known for its football fanaticism (think Friday night lights on steroids), a young woman dies at a local highschool party and Smith's nephew disappears at the same time, making him the prime suspect. However the death is ruled as a heart attack from the drugs and a plot is unveiled to bomb the next football game. Meanwhile, the old football coach is selling the players steroids and the current coach emphasizes that football players are Kings and should have whatever they want. The problem is that the parents don't seem to care as long as the team wins. Smith has to face some of his own demons but while he is confronted with his out of control anger, he is unable to get it under control."
3,"Disappointing, and Kindle version is sloppy","This was an OK book, but not what I'd expect from an award-winner.The Kindle version was apparently generated by scanning the print version, but they didn't bother to correct the multitude of mistakes. You can generally figure out what the text should be, but it's annoying."
4,Very Informative and Entertaining,"I listened to the Audio CD version of this book.In terms of strong historical value, there is not a lot to this book. It really is pretty fluffy in its tone and approach. Margaret Truman is a credible source however and she does make it very entertaining to listen to.The organization is interesting. The language is conversational. You'll come away with better knowledge of the White House, its residence and our Nations History."
3,Inside info from one who lived there,"Easy reading, more suited to a younger audience, teenagers and pre-teens. Anyone young interested in history would find it enjoyable."
3,box was broken,The box arrived broken with the inside clip that hold the third dvd in place snapped off and because i did not realize until it was opened it was not returnable
2,Buy only for nostalgia purposes,"I honestly bought this for a friend, but they didn't want anything in return. I'm not going to say this was an awful series. I will say it's good for its nostalgia. However, that's as far as it going to go. It can get very annoying for true Zelda fans within the first 5 minutes of the episodes."
4,Only because it is Zelda,"I remember watching this cartoon every Friday morning. I remember going to school that day and all I could talk about was what happened in the Zelda cartoon. Well now that I am older and have watched them again, I now see why I never want to ever see Link or Zelda talk in any of the video games. I know some people complained with the latest Zelda game that once again Link and Zelda do not speak. Well point them to this cartoon and I say there tune will change. The 'excuse me princes' line that is repeated every two seconds is enough to make you pull every last hair off the top of your head out along with anyone else hair with in a mile from you. It is that bad. The mute button helps some but only so much.Other than that, if you are a Zelda fan and you have to have everything that relates to Zelda. Well then this is for you."
4,Another nostalgiac high rating,"This is another great old cartoon based on a game. Cheesey like all the other ones, but still fun, and always great for the fans of the serious. Recommended if you like the old game cartoons or use to watch it when you was a kid."
1,A bit dissapointing.,"I bought this box set to give this series a second chance. Unfortunately, I found the series as dissapointing as I had when I was a child watching this on television.The show is quite funny, has Zelda for the most part being the boomerang-wielding heroine, though it isn't very serious as it is known the target audience is 6-9 year olds.The only reason I would recommend against this purchase is for the shows portrayl of Link. As a child playing the Legend of Zelda on the old NES system, it was unplesant to see our ""Legendary Green Hatted Hero"" as a semi plump, snort laughing, perverse womanizer with the tagline ""Excuse me, Princess!""This is a great buy if you're looking for some laughs and nostalgia, but if you're a hard core Zelda fan who has never seen this, and expect it to be a serious action show, you'll be in for a huge dissapointment."
1,3 Discs? THREE DISCS?!,"Each episode is 15 minutes! FIFTEEN MINUTES! That's the equivalent of six syndicated shows! Only three hours of material!Does this warrant three dvds and $30.00? The show is campy and fun, but come on. Don't rip the consumer a new one."
2,Ugh.,"Boy, Bill & Ted must have written the script for this stoner version of Link and Zelda. It's very grating; the stories are weak, and the animation is pretty basic. Link sounds like he's just hopped off a surfboard in the late 1980s. I shouldn't have expected too much, I suppose."
4,Zelda- Why didn't they give you your own show?,"This cartoon is definitely a trip down memory lane. The stories have little to nothing to do with the games, but it's fun seeing the characters we all love interacting for longer than five minutes.Yeah, the ""Well, EX-cuuuuse me, Princess,"" is pretty annoying,but the cartoons are so awesome, who cares?These are super fun to watch if you watched them as a child or enjoy the games. I probably wouldn't recommend this to someone unfamiliar with either. Suitable for younger kids- my four year old son adores this, but then he's played all the games (including Zelda and Zelda 2 around which this show revolves.)Bottom line, die-hard Zelda fans will enjoy this. All others probably wouldn't like this cartoon too much.."
4,An ok DVD,"It was an ok DVD, it was delivered in good condition, but it took a little longer for delivery than expected."
5,just plain chart busting,"true skynyrd heads have been waiting for this cd for a long time, but it was worth the wait. if this cd does not top the charts, theres something wrong with rock today. cant wait to see these live skynyrd dudes been with you from the begining and with this music i see no end in sight. god bless and KEEP ON ROCKIN ///////"
5,The Best One After The Crash,"This album is just great! It is without a doubt the absolute best album the band has put out since the crash. Just about every song on this album deserves a 5/5. ""Gone Fishin'"" and ""Money Back Guarantee"" are the only 2 songs that I would call filler. ""FLA"" is OK, but not as good as the rest (I give this one 3.5/5). Everything else is a masterpiece. The best songs I would say are ""Workin'"", ""Edge Of Forever"", ""Mean Streets"", & ""GWTTG (Get it While the Gettin's Good)"", just to name a few. If you're a huge die-hard Lynyrd Skynyrd fan, you'll love this album. If you hate Lynyrd Skynyrd and can't stand them..........................You'll love this album!I just wish they would play more of the songs from this album in concert.And to the reviewer above me: It's fine if you don't like Johnny Van Zant, but you and so many others need to stop coming down on him just because he's not Ronnie!"
2,"Better than ""Skynyrd 91"" but still, nothin Stands out","First of all I'm a huge Skynyrd fan.But nothing stands out in this album, the only reason Johnny Van Zant was able to get in on the whole rock singer thing is because of his brother. And another thing Johnny isnt nearly as good as Ronnie. Buy Per-Nounced instead."
1,"Better than the last, but still lame","When will these Rednecks ever go away? I gues never, because there will always be rednecks to listen to them. This release is better than the last, ""Twenty"" but it is still only worthy of one star. It was nice to see Skynyrd do the tribute thing back in 87 but it is time to hang it up boys! Go back to Rossington-Collins band or something more fun, because this is lame, with the exception of Working"
3,Smelly lotion,I like the lotion itself but it's really too smelly. Someone really nice on eBay sent me samples of all the scents and they're all just too much. I went back to Burt's Bees and gave this to my daughter.
4,It's simple,I like it but it showed up four days late. Its nothing but string with rings attached and childrens chalk
5,Excellent!,"I used this product to make markings on my driveway court. It was very easy to use, and produced great results. The first time I used the enclosed sidewalk chalk; after seeing how it came out I then used a 2"" roller and white paint. It's amazing how just adding markings makes playing basketball so much more fun."
4,Simple But Works,"This is an easy way to mark a court. Follow the old saw to ""measure twice, chalk once."" If you take your time, this works well. It's a chalk-based product, however, so goes away the next rain."
2,You Get Way You Pay For,"This system consists of several strings with plastic rings and some sidewalk chaulk. The theory is that while one person holds one end, another draws the lines with the chaulk inserted in the ring. It sortof works, but it is diffuclt to create nice clean lines. Plus, the chaulk wears off easily during heavy play.I think I will ultimately use this to measure and tape off the proper court lines and then make permanent lines with concrete paint."
3,No NBA logo,"While the description states that this ""includes NBA logo stencil"", there is no stencil in the package. In fact, the picture on the box is the same as here but without the NBA logo."
4,Great item,"Very good quality and low price, the only thing I didnt quite like is that the ""adidas"" text is not placed in the left side of the chest, as advertised, but in the lower part of the t-shirt. Not a big deal, but also, not really what is showed in the picture."
3,simple or subtle?,"Hate to admit that I'm one of those just a little baffled by the wondrous reviews this disc has received. It consists of the steady, and rather conservative, rhythms that are used in creating the foundation for basic club music. Nothing more. It is hilarious when one track rapidly fades out just as a guitar starts to be introduced into the mix. If this stuff was public domain, it would be perfect for someone to use for home recording along with whatever lead instruments or vocals they might want to add. But on its own it takes shoe-gazing to a level of serious introversion. I don't know."
5,The remarkably insightful thinking of a man who heard the sound of his own drummer,"I do not know the work of Eric Hoffer well enough to say that this book includes all of the very best of his writing. The most famous book 'The True Believer' presented what seemed to be the analysis of a central concept for understanding the modern world, the concept of the totalitarian mind. His other books of aphorisms also gave insight into social and political realities. Self- taught self- educated the longshoreman philosopher had a certain disdain for intellectuals who he felt did not know the real world. One of his great muses was Montaigne who like Hoffer was an original essayist, who wrote about things others often did not notice. Hoffer was not always right but he was a very wise and original writer. This anthology provides a truly broad selection of his work, including material from his diaries.It is the most complete compilation of his work presently available in a single volume."
5,The best book I ever read!,I love Ocean City! Those books are totally awesome! Connor is so funny and I love all the characters. Read this book for a good laugh or just for fun.
3,Music Captures The 1950's Mood,"..This CD captures the 'mood' of the early 1950's,especially with the help of Bill Elliott's orchestra.--Wendi Williams'vocals are pretty good throughout..Bill Elliott's first 'soundtrack',this cd will most likely introduce the B.E.S.O. to a lot more non-jazz music fans. 3-and 1/2 stars."
3,Dissapointing!,"Being an Elmer Bernstein fanatic, I bought this cd. THe thing I didn't know when I bought it was that there is only six minutes of Bernstein's score on it. The rest of the music is fun to listen to, but I really wanted more Bernstein music. I wouldn't buy this cd brand new."
3,batman in the 70,"The 70's was a good read for batman.The only thing is,this book was smaller thanthe rest.They could have put at least 4 to 5 morestories in it.I read this book in oneshot. I love the art and the stories,but they could of added more to thisthin book."
3,Batman's REAL golden age...,"With the possible exception of the original tales of the forties, or Frank Miller's work on the character, the seventies were the definitive era for Batman stories. This collection gives a nice overview of Batman's greatest era. I would have rated it higher, but for the ommission of the Engelhart/Rogers run In Detective Comics."
1,very disappointed,"Extremely disappointed - product not delivered after placing order.Lease expected from Amazon. As a result, I got into unnecessary prolem."
1,This book Bites,This book is the most uninformative book i have ever read. I would not recomend it to anyone
4,Fun sticker book,"I bought a few of these books to entertain my granddaughters on a plane flight. The 5-year-old really enjoyed them. The only thing that would make them perfect would be if every sticker would fit on the pages. The stickers are removeable and can be used again (only a few times), but my granddaughter wanted to use all of them instead of having to choose. These books kept the kids busy for quite a while and so were worth the money."
3,Not Bad,"It has some good info, but is way too small! If you want a general idea about different hair removal techniques get it. They need an updated version to cover the newer hair removal techniques."
1,Full of assumptions and misinformation!,"A nice idea because very little is written on this topic; however, the author falls short and makes some very biased and uncited claims. It appears to me that it is self-published because no reputable publishing house would touch something so unsubstantiated and unreferenced. For instance, Rosenthal states that, ""Pubic hair protects your vulva from bacterial infections by blocking what can get in."" What a bunch of nonsense! She also encourages readers to use 'crisco' or 'mineral oil' to clean your vulva. Whoa! I could go on and on and give numerous examples - but will leave it up to you to decide."
1,Too good to be true...,"When I first saw this product I was so excited that there was a sugar free option to this tasty candy. I have had sugar free products containing Sugar Alcohol in the past, so I did not expect this product to effect me the way that it did. The taste is great but the side effects are terrible. About two hours after eating the recommended serving size I began having severe stomach cramps, as if I had taken a laxative. Not too long after the cramps began I had to literally run to the restroom. I thought that one trip to the restroom would have sufficed and proceeded to go to the gym...BIG MISTAKE!!! Let's just say I had several trips to the restroom following my (what I thought was) a harmless snack. This product is really not worth trying to satisfy your sweet tooth. You are better off eating a peice of fruit!!"
1,Great if your about to have a Colonoscopy the next day!,"Ordered this item as I am a diabetic. Decent tasting but absolutely indigestible. Caused major gastrointestinal distress. Found hidden behind the fold a very subtle understated advisory that some individuals may experience a ""laxative"" effect. Excuse me but this was way beyond ""laxative"" and lasted more than 18 hours! This could replace the pre-colonoscopy medicine Miralax. Wait I might be on to something here! At least the the pre-op procedure would taste good. I subsequently went back to the site and looked at the customer reviews and learned I am not alone in this experience. Amazon needs to clearly advise customers of this potential in their product description. Until they do I would hope they refund people who buy it If you decide to try it after reading this, have a book and a roll handy and don't leave home."
1,Major gas problems after eating,We love the strawberry Twizzlers and buy them quite a lot. I was so excited to see the sugar free ones at Walmart. We bought it and they tasted pretty good (were expensive though). A short time later we started with gas and running to the bathroom. It's been 24 hours now and we're still having the gas and believe me it's major gas...you sure don't want to be away from home.I would not recommend this candy to anyone.
5,Tastes Almost Exacty Like The Real Thing!,"If you are on a low carb diet, or just need to watch your calorie and sugar intake, and you are a Twizzler addict like me, then you will love the sugar-free version! I have tried the sugar-free red Vine candy, thought it was awful. saw these SF Twizzlers in Wal-Mart and decided to give them a try. I was very impressed. They taste a lot like the real Twizzlers, and the funny thing is, I usually get headaches if I eat too many real Twizzlers, but these SF ones did not have that affect on me. I notice a lot of reviwers say the taste is good, but the sugar alcohols made them have some bad gastrointestinal issues. There is a warning on the package about this! And I have been eating Atkins bars and other low-carb goodies for years, and the intestinal problems ended for me a long time ago. I can eat about 12 pieces of these at once and be fine. I just know my limit."
4,Great alternative...,"These are a great alternative to the ""real thing"" BUT do not over-indulge. They have gastrointestinal side effects (stated on the package) which means you can't ""pig-out"" like you did on the full sugar option. 1-2 sticks is all you need anyway... Great for anyone that craves a twizzler at the movies... I know I do! But I hate what sugar does to my body."
1,Confirmed - No go for Dell's,"Bought one of these fellers for my laptop to use one of the old IBM 'clicky' type keyboards; no trouble using the keyboard with any computer with a ps/2 connector, but the USB converter is not recoginzed with the Dell."
1,I wish we could give zero stars...,"I hooked this thing up to my dell 1705 laptop tonight so I could use my nice old keyboard on it. It never worked. Went to amazon and read the comments - seems alot of people have had the same problem. Aparently laptops are not the ""normal"" pc's that you might make from scratch and have ""custom"" stuff in them from Dell, Compaq, HP, Gateway, Apple, IBM, Lenovo, among others...It DOES NOT WORK - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - TELL AMAZON TO DITCH THIS."
3,"this is a passive adapter, not a converter (which is why it isnt working for many)","all this thing does is reposition the connection so its compatible with the usb slot on your pc, it does not actively change the signal to make it usb compatible. so it will only work with mice n keyboards that are set up to be used with adapters already -- this usually isnt the case with the devices most people will want this for. you guys want to look for converters, not adapters. for success, id stick with the ones that get high marks in the user reviews.good luck!"
1,did not work on LINUX,This adaptor would not allow my ps2 keyboard or mouse to work under LINUX (Ubuntu 10.04).
2,this is *not* a generic adapter - believe the description!,"I was hoping this is a generic PS/2 adapter for keyboards, but no such luck. The product description claims it's for logitech devices, and I have a PS/2 keyboard I bought at a thrift store that isn't logitech... and it doesn't work with it. Oh well - just have to get a cheap USB keyboard after all."
1,Waste of money,"This item does NOT work; don't waste your time and money buying it. I wish I could give it zero stars. I tried it using 3 different devices (mice) on 4 different computers--3 desktops and a laptop. Windows could not recognize the device on any of them. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy. It's not that the item is so expensive, but it's the principle!"
1,PS/2 to USB adapter,the adapter did not work on the keyboard I was attempting to use. A pc expert told me that the keyboard would not work with the purchased adapter. I gave the keyboard to charity and kept the adapter as the postage was more than the cost of the adapter.
1,Didn't work,"Didn't work for me on a logitech mouse. Tried it in several different ports. Computer never recognized i even plugged anything in to any usb port. I bought another dual adapter with short cables on it, a little bigger and bulkier, plugged that same mouse into it and it into the same usb port and instantly that combination worked, so it is not my mouse or usb port, it was this green adapter.Got it to at sort of work on another mouse but only by holding it at a slight angle once plugged in to usb port. Then it malfunctioned again.Not reliable as it is poorly constructed, if you get it to work it is a random event.Do not buy."
1,Clearer info would be helpful,"Didn't work. I didn't know the difference between ""active"" and ""passive"". This is ""passive"" so it didn't work for either mouse or keyboard. Better to get a new keyboard at Walmart for $12 than to buy an ""active"" adapter for $18. Problem solved. That's on me, but it would have been helpful to have a clearer explanation of the functionality limitations (it was on the back of the packaging, but I don't remember seeing it on this site's description of the product)."
1,Does Not Work,"I bought one of these at a local store to use with my Dell computer, but it does not work. The old keyboard I wanted to use is not recognized by the computer."
1,Did not work for DELL keyboard...,"This adapter did not work with my DELL keyboard... I was shocked. Not sure how they can make it custom, but they did."
1,Does not work with all keyboards!,"Be advised that this product does not work with all keyboards and mice. The back of the package says that it only works with keyboards and mice ""designed to be used with an adapter."" This should have been included on the product description."
1,Good luck,"Adapter has not worked with any computer/keyboard/mouse combination I have tried. Not a fault of the adapter, it is electrically sound but is a passive device, not active, so it does no communication conversion."
1,"0 star product, 5 star service","ZERO star product, forced to give it 1. Decided to start reusing a trackball that was used up until a year ago, and could not find my old adapter. So I ordered one from Amazon. did not work in 5 USB ports in 3 computers [including the one the trackball was originally attached to], so I tried with 3 other PS/2 devices, light came on in one of the mice when the adapter was inserted 1/4 the way, but when pushed in, NADA.Contacted Amazon, and Voila, a replacement was on its way. Just received the replacement, and get the same results. Last product from cables unlimited that I will purchase.Only positive is Amazon. Fast, efficient, customer oriented service. 5 ***** stars."
1,The little gadget that couldn't,"The little gadget arrived in a timely fashion. Thrilled, I ripped open the package and ran to my netbook. Plugged it in to a full-sized keyboard and into the netbook...nothing. It does not work."
5,Superb!,"This is one of the best books on worship I've read in a long time. The book talks all about ""Ascending in worship, descending in war"", just as in biblical times the worshippers led the people into war. It's about spending time with God in worship, in getting to know Him better, and to hear His heart, and then to go out from there to live life His way, including knowing how better to pray for people. I highly recommend it for all Christians!"
5,Good old fashioned heavy metal,"For those who think that old school heavy metal is dead, this CD is for you. Heavy riffs, guitar solos and Udo's distinctive voice make this CD a must have. If you liked Accept, you'll definitely love Udo."
5,Falling in love with this film.,"All I can say is, that this film is one of the best indie films I've seen so far. Who would have thought that a love story between a couple of kids could be so romantic and heartwarming? I think that anyone who experienced a first love at such a young age, will find some way to relate."
5,I was then 2,"if you were there you already know ... give this flick your undivided attention to detail and background. A may ZING ... like WOW, anyway, you get it or you don't!! I DO."
5,A great episode,A great episode. Ripped from the headlines but a twist that wasn't seen coming. A heartwrenching episode. I don't want to spoil it for anybody but it is the only episode of SVU where I was crying at the end....
5,L&O: SVU,My favorite show! This is a great deal and I live on a buget but you can't beat this offer!Thanks!
3,OK for small sized birdbaths,got about 10 months of use (over two seasons) before it stopped working. The foil perforated from bird nails causing the failure I believe. I'm on my third one so I do like them.
3,Bird bath heater,Am wondering if it will last very long. Is extremely flimsy....needs to be held down with a rick or it would blow or float away.
1,Just didn't work,Seems simple enough but after seeing no improvement in my birdbath I took my 2 samples indoors and plugged them in a working kitchen outlet. After 1/2 hour they were still both cold to the touch. Not much else to say.
1,Worked for only a couple of days,I'd used a similar bird bath heater before and it was getting corroded looking after a few years' use so I decided to replace it. This one just didn't work after a couple of days.
1,where's my order please?,"I never received this item yet, but did receive the other two items I ordered at the same time. However, they are totally useless without the birdbath water heater for which they were intended."
5,Works great!,"I was unsure because it is so lightweight, but it has been working very well. The temperature has been in the low 20's already, and it is working like a charm."
1,It didn't work...,"I ordered this because of the other reviews. I plugged it into a kitchen outlet to try it out and there was no heat whatsoever. I decided that maybe it takes awhile, so I put it in the birdbath overnight and the water was frozen solid in the morning. Also, you need a long extension cord to use with it, because the cord itself is extremely short...as you can see in the photo. (BIC Supply did give me a full refund)"
1,Don't Bother,"I purchased this bird bath de-icer based on favorable reviews and low cost.Heater arrived in a timely manner, but was defective. A replacement was provided but worked for only a short period of time.If there is a bright side to this, it is that Amazon makes returns easy."
4,Birds like it,"We purchased two of the Bird Bath De-Icers recently. One for a friend for Christmas, and one more for ourselves. We have had one in use for the past year (this is the second winter.) We are happy with it's performance, and the birds appreciate liquid water when the temperature gets way below freezing. It is effective to about 0 degrees F. Then the edges of the water start to freeze. I have to weight it down with a rock to keep it in place. We bought a replacement because this one is getting dark spots, probably algae, in the indentations that is hard to clean off."
1,This didn't work for me,"Farm Innovators Economical Bird Bath De-Icer Model B-9, 44-WattI really wanted to like this heater. It's made in my hometown.First of all, it floated and I had to weight it down with a rock. I called their help line and was told that was okay.As long as the temp was above 25 degrees it worked fine. But any lower, it froze on the top inch. It froze all the way when it got below that. I wasn't able to remove the Farm Inno heater until the water thawed. When I did, it tore. Also, I cracked my birdbath trying to thaw it. I didn't know that until I had purchased another heater. Of course, all the water leaked out. I am thankful that I realized that & I caught it in time to prevent the new heater from burning out."
1,bird bath de-icer,"bad item, it did not work. Water got inside and it froze in the birdbath. I had to wait for it to thaw and when I brung it in the house it leaked water from it for 2 days. Shame on me, at 63 years of age, I open box and threw everything away and expected it to work. I do not know how to get it replaced now. Never will I order something like this again. I'll go to a store from now on."
1,Doesn't work,"I had read the other reviews written awhile back where everyone seemed to love this. Unfortunately, there is now something wrong with the quality of this product (and add to that it's gone up in price just since I purchased it!). I plugged it in and the water in my birdbath froze solid on a night that wasn't very cold. Do not buy it. I will say that the Amazon return/refund was fast and hassle-free."
4,"One worked, one didn't.","I ordered two of these since one reviewer said they work well, but generally only last one season. I put one in the bird bath and just assumed it would work. Silly me. What was I thinking. Should have tested it. Froze over. Second one works just fine. I got busy over Christmas and didn't get the first one ready to be returned in time, so I'm out the cost of one. Even though I'm very pleased with the one that works, I'm holding my breath hoping it does last. The birds are grateful!"
4,44 watt bird bath heater,I have a medium sized concrete bird bath and this unit keeps it thawed down to about -12 celcius. i think i will buy the bigger one as the concrete is hard to heat. In a small bath this unit would be great.
2,Not as good as I thought,"I do have a shallow bird bath, but being in Minnesota (even tho the winter is a warm one) there have been days when it was 10 degrees and the birth bath water was froze. I have to put a rock on top of it because otherwise it floats to top and the birds definitely don't like the shiny silver. Not my best buy that's for sure."
2,Get a bigger heater,This heater is useless for tempatures below 20 degrees.I was fooled by other reveiws.I have to take a pan of hot water to thaw it out when temps are below 20 degrees.
1,Worthless,I purchased one of these many years ago and it lasted just fine. I have purchased 2 since then and both have been trash. I don't know what has changed but I would not recommend this de-icer to anyone.
1,farm innovators B 9 Economical birdbath de-icer. 44 watt,"This de-icer has never really worked since we started using it, the water froze up , it never thawed and it won't work.I've had de-icers like this one before and they worked for years, I'd like a replacement or my money back."
5,Farm Innovators Bird Bath De-Icer,"This a very economical price and it is doing its job of keeping the bird bath from freezing. Unfortunately, I forgot that I had a raised area in the middle of birdbath and it doesn't lay down completely so I have to put water in a lot because the de-icer is so close to the top. It is still working in spite of this though. Birds are very happy and so am I. I will probably buy another birdbath this spring that will work better with the de-icer."
2,De-Icer,"I ordered 2 of these. One works fine, yet the other one worked for 2 days, then not again. I'll be sending it back."
2,Keeps tripping the switch,I wish I had bought the more expensive one. This one trips the circuit after two minutes of being plugged in. It has a problem and I sent it back.
3,Works/Doesn't Work,"The first of this deicer I had worked flawlessly for 3 or 4 winters until it finally wore out -- the aluminum gets a little beat up over time. But, the second identical deicer purchased this fall worked only sporadically and, then, not at all. I have no idea why, but it's very disappointing."
1,Heater for Birdbath,Couldn't handle temperature below 25 degrees in a shallow birdbath. Has to be weighted down to keep on bottom of bath.
1,2 out of 3 ordered did not work,"I ordered three of these ""Farm Innovators B-9 Economical Birdbath De-Icer, 44-Watt"", 2 for our yard and one for a friend. Luckily, the one bought for our friend is working. The two for our birdbaths do not. One immediately trips any outlet that it is plugged into. The other does not trip the GFI but it does not keep the water from freezing. Also, the ones I bought were Amazon Prime but when I tried to return them on the order center, it said it was over 30 days from the purchase and I could not return them. WHAT? I ordered them Oct 30, it is now Nov 12, and this is the first time we have had hard freezing at night, so the first time they were tried. Plus, the link to the PDF ""Product Manual"" is for different models, not this one. I am dissapointed and also MAD!"
2,Junk,"Cord is far too short. Cord also heats up just like the rest of the heater. Made of what looks like heavy duty duct tape (the metal kind) with a heating element wound around inside. Looks like a shock hazard to me, what with the short cord putting the plug in very close proximity to a 120v cord connection. Did not all the other 5-star buyers notice these things? Do not use this without a ground fault circuit interrupter on the main cord. Also, since the cord is so short the connection will be exposed to rain and snow during the heating season. Has no thermostat or fuse either. Whoever thought this was a safe design needs to do some study on basic electricity hazards. Frankly, I don't care how well it works at this point. So, if you do get one of these things, be sure to unplug the main power cord at the source before messing around with the positioning of heater in the water-filled bird bath. Good luck."
1,Absolute junk.,"Bought one in November, it quit after three weeks. Returned for a new one, which did not work out of the box. Also bought two Farm Innovators heated dog bowls, one quit working after three months. Clearly, no quality control at all. From these experiences, I don't recommend ANY Farm Innovator products."
5,The birds love it!,"I'm very happy with this de-icer. It was easy to install (just place in bottom of bird bath). Using it in conjunction with a thermostatically controlled outlet (a Farm Innovators Thermo Cube) has meant that it automatically comes on when needed and goes off when the weather is warm enough not to require it. I looked at the heated bird baths available, but realized that a de-icer was all I really needed. It saves me money and didn't break the budget. Maybe someday I'll buy a heated bird bath, but for now this de-icer does the job just fine."
2,Bird Bath De-icer,"I am very disappointed. This is the second de-icer I have had to return in 2 months. For some reason it just quits working. If it was not for Amazon's super easy exchange/return, I would be looking for another product. I have used this product for several years and it always worked GREAT, even in the coldest weather. So that is way I am hoping the 3rd time is the charm. I hope Farm Innovators fixes whatever is going on because I noticed all the latest bad reviews are within the last few months."
3,you get what you pay for,I bought this as it was fairly inexpensive. It does work but the cord is too short and the product is so light that the weight of the extension cord tends to want to pull it out of the birdbath. I put a piece of a brick on top of it to hold it in the birdbath. The birds seem to appreciate having water to drink when it is below freezing so it is serving its purpose for now.
2,"Maybe you'll get a good one, maybe not.","Obviously, there's a quality control issue with Farm Innovators' econo de-icer. Mine worked great for a month or so. It no longer functions. Those lucky enough to get a defective one right out of the box can return it and try again, others are either satified or 'left cold'.I regret not paying a few dollars more and perhaps receiving something more durable."
4,bird bath heater,"Econo Bird Bath 44 WattsBought one for the winter of '05 and '06 and it has worked well. No electrocutions yet! It does not work well with a 3"" snow fall or more but keeps the water unfrozen 90% of the time. The birds seem to appreciate it."
1,Sometimes you DO get what you pay for,"Just like Shebuela, I ordered this based on the reviews. I received my De-Icer around December 9th. I plugged it in and also got no heat. I, too, thought it was just going to take awhile. The temperature in my area (Atlanta, GA) dipped to just freezing (maybe a degree below) and I got a thin sheet of ice on my water's surface. I was able to crack it with my keys and keep going. I wanted to return it immediately but all the positive reviews lead me to believe it may just be my outlet. I tried a new extension cord. No difference. By the way, I also needed a long outdoor extension cord. I tried another outlet. No difference. I even plugged my curling iron into both outdoor outlets just to make sure they worked. The outlets are fine. Last night we got down to about 27 degrees here. I went outside and found my water frozen solid with the De-Icer stuck in the center. To say the least, I am furious."
2,Knife holder broke,"The item was sent quickly and looked well-made, but the belt snap broke immediately with no pressure. The pop rivet was weak and came loose. It needed a wide washer behind rivet to hold."
1,Ebbolutionary Dead End,"Don't bother. There are a couple of good tracks but most are either boring or downright annoying. Of all the 12"" singles, CD singles, and EP's that I have, and Muscle and Hate, this is the worst. Did I say don't bother? What I meant was that this thing is a waste of time and money. Only people who collect things that have ""Nitzer Ebb"" printed on them would want this. You sure shouldn't get it for the music."
2,no useful information,"in this book, Manaster gives lots of info on the past. folklore, tales, and the like. She gives info on the people who have studied them greatly. she shows how they are tied to our past. But, if you i looking for a book that tells you how to care for these wonderful creatures, you'll need to look somewhere else. there is no animal husbandry. No info on keeping them happy and healthy. So, if you are looking for history, it's a great book; if you need helpful information, try another book."
4,Seven Hours to Judgement,"A must see for anyone who lives in Seattle. This film takes you on a thrill packed romp from the concrete jungles of Pioneer Square, to the sub-terrainian horrors of underground Seattle. Filled with action, action and more action, this movie contains one of the most thrilling chase sequences ever filmed in Seattle's little known subway system (I won't tell if you don't)!Buy it NOW!Shawn"
3,"mystery, suspense",I did not qite understand the movie from the beginning to the end. i am not saying it is a bad movie on the contrary it is a fairly good movie.
2,Revenge Unfilling,"What is supposed to be a comment on how the justice system favors criminals while victims suffer doesn't shed a new perspective on the idea. Bridges and Moore don't have much chemistry as the married couple terrorized by Leibman, who's anguished character fails the produce the sympathy that he should have. The way the revenge is played out against Bridges' character is pretty far-fetched, too. Bridges is a good actor, but this is not a good vehicle for him."
5,Also fits Starmix,Bought this hose for my Starmix after I found out that it has the same connector. Works like a charm since the other end fits on my Festool tools
5,Great Format - Buy this one!,"The format for these books is what makes me buy them every time. If you're an IT manager you can take this book to an employee who doesn't know anything about Win2000 and let them answer their own questions or make their own changes. This is a big time saver. I own several of these books. I buy every one of them I can -- they pay off every time with the step by step screen shots --hey, even a third grader could do these tasks!"
5,"yes, they do!","I love, love, love this band and I think it's awesome that they put together this compilation. The Suburbs recently had 2 shows @ 1st Ave and they still have the magic. I have and always will support these crazy boyz! Rock on ;)"
2,The First Was Better,"I enjoyed Angel at Troublesome Creek as a light cozy, and was looking forward to the second installment.Unfortunately it is disappointing. There is not enough of the charming angel, and not enough mystery.Clues appear without effort on the part of the heroine. She just follows the path laid out before her. Her reactions to learning secrets about her sister seem unreal. There is no grief, no discovery, just rotely following the clues where they lead.The basic plot is OK, but it is great need of a rewrite to fill in the characters, the emotions, the people we are supposed to care about."
3,An Angel To Die For,The concept is brilliant (an angel helping out) and the book was entertaining however I just wished there was a bit more of the otherwordly included in the book. So much is made about the angel when in actuality you hear or see very little of her or her powers. She doesn't seem all that angelic.Phila
1,Not worth it,"I loved the idea of this book and was hoping for good things. Unfortunately they weren't forthcoming. The plot was too elaborate, the 'angel' of the title was actually very little in evidence throughout, and I rapidly became bored with the characters. I won't be looking for the other book in the series."
1,WRONG,This is NOT the CD i ordered i ordered Tribute to Jimmy Buffett by VARIOUS artists this one that was sent was done on PRO TOOLS in someones garage by some guy his guitar & all the other instruments were on an I POD an INSULT to my GULF COAST EARS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE take note that the CD pictured here is NOT the one that was sent so this was not Amazons fault but the actual seller which i wont mention..... im still waiting for the REAL tribute CD.... and i will give a full review on that one.....
4,"Fine remastering, however.....","It's wonderful to have these two albums reissued. The remastering is excellent; piano timbre is realistic and the balances are fine. The music and performances seem to have weathered time rather well. My only complaint is that the album ""Near You"" is presented here in monaural. Why? Were the stereo tapes lost or had they deteriorated? It was issued in genuine stereo originally (I dubbed it to cassette from my original LP). I'll have to admit I'm a little puzzled and feel a little cheated. ""Till"" however, is here in its original stereo.In spite of the 'mono' issue, I still recommend the purchase of this CD. Lots of great memories, and Mr. Williams sounds as fresh and lively as he did when I heard him in live performance about the time ""Near You"" was recorded."
3,Could have been better,"I think the author did a lot of work on this book and it is helpful but it really reads like a book written by someone trying to convert Protestants to Orthodoxy. The mystery is why Clendenin is still Protestant. The book does not make, as I recall, one criticism of the theology or practice of Orthodoxy. For Protestants who would like to examine Orthodoxy biblically (e.g., evaluate the biblical underpinnings of icons, pro and con) this would not be a good choice. I would recommend ""The Three Great Churches"" (Rials) or ""the Gospel According to Rome"" (McCarthy). Even though the latter is about Catholicism, many of the issues are the same for Orthodoxy. All that said, this book and its companion (the reader) are very helpful and illuminating for those wanting to understand Orthodoxy from a theologian's perspective. The graphics are very good and it is very well documented."
4,quality product,"This age reversal eye cream is a great product. I am a 31 year old woman and am starting to be concerned about wrinkles around my eyes. I put it on in the morning and at night before bed. It soaks in and I can feel it deeply repairing the delicate skin around my eyes. It only takes a tiny amount to cover the whole eye area so it lasts a long time. Desert Essence makes all natural products and that is important to me considering the fact that my skin is irritated by many things, especially chemicals. If you care what you put into your body and what you put on your skin, then this it the product for you. It's all natural, it works beautifully and the cost is economical.....what more could you ask for?"
1,Only a 6th in jar when it arrived,Was on chat a long time discussing the problem.Not a full jar.They said I could return what I got.That they were in the process of printing a UPS label.Need this corrected.Filled out review form in the positive if remember correctly before jar was opened.
3,3.5 stars - solid melodic rock album,"2003's Automatic was the third release from American melodic rock band Firefly. Melodic rock wasn't exactly flying high in the US at that time, so it's admirable to see a band like Firefly that carries that classic sound forward. The band - on this album at least - reminds me a lot of Enuff Znuff, especially in their vocal harmonies, which are a great counterpart to the guitar melodies. Automatic is full of solid, steady, mid-tempo melodic rock songs plus the occasional ballad, and while none of the songs really stick in your head afterwards, they're all perfectly enjoyable while the disc is spinning.Automatic is, to date, the final album from Firefly. It never really reaches ""essential"" status, but Automatic is still a very solid, very enjoyable melodic rock album. Fans of Enuff Znuff in particular will want to check this album out, but it should appeal to melodic rock fans in general, especially if, like me, you run across a copy on clearance."
3,Not a true ball type workout,"I must say, Patrick is great and the workout is fun and well done, but it is an aerobic workout (a good one), using the ball as a prop, rather than a true ""ball"" workout. I was hoping for a routine that would stretch and strengthen each muscle system, the typical ball exercise fare. This is not that at all. You sit on the ball and bounce A LOT, walk around the ball, carry the ball while you move, or bounce the ball while you move. There are no targeted muscle exercises, its strictly aerobic."
4,Works Well So Far,Bought this to tow a 12' fiberglass boat and trailer from a Dodge truck. It's been in use for three months with no problems.
2,grev,I shoud like more information about the book.In any case this book will be interesting for me because i am working in the field of copiers maintenase and servicing.I think that this book will be usefull for technitians and students.
2,"Quality is ok, but does NOT provide privacy","I spent twice as much on this shade as similar ones out there because it boasted it provides privacy (vs the others that make it a point to say they do not). I live in a first floor apartment on a busy street where people are constantly walking by my kitchen window so it was very important to me that the shade I ordered provide privacy. I previously had a flimsy white roman shade from Ikea that did a surprisingly good job but didn't clean well. So I got this shade up tonight and it looks nice and classy, but to my dismay you can 100% see through it. And I don't mean shadows - it's basically like not having a shade up at all. I am extremely disappointed and do not recommend this product."
5,Berserk.....the anime,"First of all for anyone who is not familiar with Berserk, it is based upon the japanese manga series. the anime only goes up to volume 12 of the manga series. the manga series is up to volume 28 and it is STILL GOING. when people say that the anime has a bad ending...they really have no idea what they are talking about cause the story has not ended yet. that ""ending"" that they are talking about is only the end of that chapter or volume. the berserk story is the best story that i have been fortunate enough to have come across. i really suggest getting the mangas which have been translated into english and are being published by Darkhorse comics. currently the translated mangas are only up to volume 6. but you can read them online if you go to thespectrum.net/berserk. berserk is not only the best anime, but its the best manga and story EVER!!!"
5,"Breathtaking, a Masterpiece","Berserk is a Gothic Fantasy in every sense imaginable. Combining fantasy, horror, medieval warfare, great characters and even some humor into a terrific series.The story is told from the point of view of Guts, a young mercenary with a tragic past. From his point of view we watch the rise of Griffith... a man who's ambition could crush entire kingdoms in his quest from peasanthood to the throne of Midland. Joining the Band of the Hawk under Griffith's leadership, Guts gains unwanted fame while others revel in it. But there is a true sense of doom and dread as the dark secret behind Griffith's true destiny is revealed, centering around a demonic gift given to him long ago called the Behelit or the Egg of the King.Based on the manga by Kentaro Miura, Berserk is a series not to be missed. If you like it, be sure to pick up the manga as well."
5,Pure Genius,"The series Berserk is one of the most amazing things i have ever seen. So artistic and beatifull full of desire and dreams,that are so motivational and inspiring that will change many perspectives in your life and will open many more.Recomended for all anime fans out there and people familiar with Nero and those Renasaunce fairs, got to love medievil times. Plus dont get mad at the ending its supposed to be that way its done on purpose,remmber the series isnt done thats not even half of the series so you have alot to look foward too :)"
2,frustrated,"i watched the whole series and must say i enjoyed most of it, but i think saying it has a bad ending is an understatement. i have never felt more frustrated about any ending more than this one. i never have felt i wanted more resolution in an aime most the time i like less but in berserk there was no resolution. i would have been satisfied if they atleast hinted in the end what happened but there was nothing.its not only the ending. the whole story has loads of foreshadow that kept me watching but in the end it combined almost none of it. i was really disapointed by it. guts is a little too invicible for my taste also."
3,Sad,"With an intresting story outline, this anime lacks an ending. The fictional ending was an outrage and 'out of scale' compared to the fiction baseline of the story.I would not recommend buying this unless you're an anime collector. The graphics quality does show it is pretty old.It 'starts' to get interesting halfway through, but the ending just spoils any possible factor of enjoyment."
3,great...until the end,"This anime was great. I was really into it...until the end that is. This may well have been the worst ending I have ever seen in an anime, and that si saying a lot since they often have very obscure and unresolved endings. The ending just blows, simple as that, terrible. If you don't watch the last 3 or so episodes, then the series is pretty good. Since the ending doesn't resolv eanything anywya, you won't really be missing out."
4,Gorgeous,"This is a captivating, beautiful anime. The artwork is drop dead, the characters are rich and heart breakingly real. Just a warning that this is a dark, dark story. Just a small part of the bigger work that is the original manga, and the ending is killer. Mostly because it just stops. There should have been a season two and the fact that there is not is what keeps me from giving it five stars. Not for the faint of heart, but worth a look if you love gritty, real characterizations."
4,"It is not perfect, but it is good.","The singing of Murray, Masterson and Garrett leaves very little to desire. However, the mannerism and voice quality of Christofer Robson is too much for my taste. The production is not exceptional and the customes are silly. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable work that really deserves to be obtained and watched more than once. The music is superb, and Mackerras handles it smoothly and elegantly. Despite all my misgivings, it gave me lots of pleasure."
5,How Handel should be done,I have viewed this lovely performance many times and find that it gets more wonderful with each viewing. The only thing that I miss is some kind of subtitle. Some of the words are not intelligible so much of the humor of the English translation is missed. The singers are all first rate with the exception of Valerie Masterson who is simply radiant. Her high soprano gets a bit thin on top but watching her one sees a consumate professional with a sweet sound who is so musical that she totally inhabits the character. There is somthing so disarmingly feminine about her that one cannot take ones eyes away from her. The staging is not traditional but is wonderfully tasteful and inventive.This DVD seems to be out of print now but I hope it will be reissued WITH subtitles. The newer version of this opera has some interesting things about it but falls far short of the charm and joy of this production.
2,Wait for the revival,"This is a live recording of the 1988 production. It was revived in 1995, with mostly the same cast. Both versions were recorded for television. Art Haus has released the later version in Europe."
3,Saw them,"I saw this band open for Lynyrd Skynyrd and ZZ Top on January 18th in Wilkes Barre, PA and I have to say that right after the concert I went out and bought this CD. This band, with some radio play,and some breaks, can be a band that will be heard from in the new Millennium. Get this CD and see for yourself! Sort of a cross between Jackyl and Guns N Roses, but with a southern, blues edge to it."
4,Laidlaw,"Saw these guys live in concert and immediately purchased their first CD. It is fantastic. Great talent. Vocals great, guitars are awesome. Percussion superb. Content and lyrics are real good. Recommend for anyone who loves southern rock..Skynyrd,,,Molly hatchet...Blackfoot"
1,All dark pink - not the rainbow of lavenders pictured,You get 12 of the same ugly dark pink color guitar picks. Not the rainbow of lavender colors pictured. My daughter was beyond disapppointed.
1,Not what I was expecting...,"While the guitar picks themselves are fantastic, I have never had a problem with this brand of picks, I do have an issue about the supplier. From the ad I thought I would get all 12 colors of picks, or at least get to choose what shade of pink I wanted. As I didn't get to choose what color I wanted I assumed they would send me 12 different shades of pink/purple as advertised!! When they came in the mail they were all the same color and a really really nasty shade of purple!! Not what I was expecting at all....I was very disappointed :'( I paid about 4 dollars for these picks, and amazon made me pay 5 bucks for shipping, which I had clicked the free shipping offer!!! And I didn't get them for 2 weeks!!! I also ordered a guitar hard case which was free shipping and I received that in 2 days!! Needless to say the whole experience with these stupid picks was frustrating and disappointing."
5,"Profoundly chilling, unsettling","The movie begins slowly. When the protagonist unintentionally intercepts a phone call from a missile silo announcing the beginning of nuclear war, we begin to see the mass response of humans to looming death. Panic builds ever so slowly in the midst of the night. Hedonism and violence break out. The scenes of chaos in the streets eventually show the inability of our society to face mortality. The vapor trails of missiles in the sky still stick in my mind."
3,"Love the movie, I still do. The DVD is 4:3, so it's up to you","The DVD is 4:3 for old school TV, fitted to the screen, so it's up to you if you want it, since this is the only DVD out there of this movie right now, and it's 2011. Hopefully somebody will do the film a proper transfer justice and give us the Blu-Ray treatment soon."
4,Interesting,"This story is an interesting perspective on what people's reactions might be if they were to find out in advance that the bombs were dropping. Moral of the story is if the time comes, 'get the hell out of Dodge' and don't waste precious time doing it either or you may find it to be an excercise in futility................"
1,FAIL at being watchable,"Maybe I woke up on the wrong side of my rock, but this movie SUCKED.It was horrible- the acting was bad, filming, quality of shots/scenes...This could have been a good flick- it was just done poorly.Maybe it was the overwelming 80's-ness of the movie- which could ruin ANY movie.""are you a helicopter pilot?"" sigh...and the gas station scene?!?!? really? That JUST happened...Was funny to see Bubba in the movie though. Shramp scampi."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though the film is marred by the fact that the two leads (especially Mare Winningham) are not interesting or attractive enough for us to care about them, Miracle Mile manages to present several indelible images along with a sublime sense of looming doom; dated, but well worth watching."
1,This movie makes no sense,I just don't get this pile of crap movie. Why would there be a random nuke attack on LA?There is nothing redeeming or a message from this movie...its a waste of time.If its on TV change the channel.
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE!,"This is a complete waste of time. The premise is promising, but the movie doesn't deliver. Someone should remake this one and give it a better treatment. It could be a real neat movie. Glad I bought I used copy. I plan on throwing it away."
3,Time has not done this film well,"It was an enjoyable movie, but in many ways really of its time. Its outdated."
3,Average movie,"Like most movies of this kind, you leave depressed. You know the ending before you start. The bomb falls and everybody dies."
1,"Very good film, bad format","I saw this film in the cinema many years ago. Now, with the DVD, i have the chance of see again this film like in the cinema: ERROR!!! The film is presented in Pan & Scan format, then arround 50% of the image is lost. This can't pass in an era of technology. These DVD can't be selled because are a insult to the creators of the film and to those audience that like the cinema art. Don't buy this DVD if you like to see movies like in the cinema."
4,Should do a modern remake,Great idea for a movie. The beginning is boring but once the phone call is made the excitement is dialed up. Kind of funny because of all the 80's styles shown but a good story.
3,I'd use this seller again,"The movie was in good condition, my only displeasure was the seller was on vacation, which is totally understandable, and as a result my movie took quite a while to arrive. He was very nice though and let me know he was away and apologized. I recommend this seller!"
3,Doesn't stand up to the test of time that well...,"I love end of the world/nuclear war type movies, and this one is ambitious, but focuses mostly on the relationship between Anthony Edwards and his new love, and then on peoples reactions to the news that a nuclear war is coming. There is no footage of what happens after the war, which is usually my favorite part in these types of movies.Many parts seemed kind of cheesy 15 years after this was made, but it is not a low budget movie and is worth a view if you really enjoy this genre, but overall I would say it is worth a rental, and is not really a memorable movie, at least not in 2004."
1,So bad after 40 minutes we peeked at end (which was worse!),"What a disappointment. I read so many positive reviews of this movie, I figured, how can I go wrong? Horrid film: lead characters that you wished would die, earnest but bad acting, implausible situations, cop killing...this movie leaves a bad taste in your mouth even during the credits at the beginning. The further you get into it, the worse it gets. After 40 minutes we kind of fast forwarded through to see if it redeemed itself, but it literally gets worse and worse (I am NOT exaggerating!). The ending is just a culmination of the whole bad package. I can console myself in that I wasted only 40 minutes of my life on this film instead of the entire hour and a half. AWFUL!!"
5,The best source of useful information for advanced meditation!!,"Shiva Sutras: The Supreme AwakeningThe best source of useful information for advanced meditation!!Why meditate ... what are we doing here?Where did we come from ...Where are we going ...How do I get where we want to go?Want some REAL wisdom; not some self serving BS?This IS what you've been looking for and a real shock that you have the answers in your hands ... finally!Substitute the word ""GOD"" for Shiva and you're ready to get some awesome answers."
3,Midwest Midwife hits close to home,"A chronological account of life on the prairie for one young woman in the early 20th century. Delivering babies for early Dakota homesteaders was a demanding duty for a young woman who also had her own family to care for. There are surprises and tragedy in this little novel based on the life of the author's own mother. Ms Gemberling (Manger) has changed the names (Langer for Manger) and the decendents of Minnie Vinger Manger (Mindy Vinson Langer)will enjoy guessing who is who. A good read for the family, friends and residents of Williston, Grenora, and for those who remember, Bonetrail, North Dakota."
3,A fast paced research,"The information is priceless as a sort of reference-compendium and salute to Latina and Mexicana immigrants. A good chunk is dedicated to a case analysis of a Protestant social service mission working in a Texas community to imprint anglican values and culture on the new immigrants. Another dedicated cultural aspect explores the affect of Americanization on young unmarried women and the system of chaperoning stemming from the honor of the family having to be upheld by orthodox views of virginity. The book is inspiring in its scope but meanders a bit excitedly like a river through early immigration, americanization and chicana feminism. Starts off slow and nurturing upon each theme but gradually erodes into a more sporadic form."
2,Dry and timid,"The theme is interesting, although unsubstantiated and weak. For centuries, Mexican-American women have silently been shaping the cultural and economic development of the Southwest. These women have raised children who have integrated into the US culture, worked, built networks. Their efforts have helped Mexican Americans find their own place in America. However, this book does not do the justice it probably had the intentions on doing. The strong aspect of the book is the distinctive culture that has slowly gained momentum in the last Century. Either the strength just isn't there, or this author was not able to accurately portray it."
2,Below par...,"This is not the best biography of Eleanor with its plethora of speculation and opinion, as well as, pseudo-psychology of mother/son relationships and homosexuality. An okay enough biography if for some reason you cannot acquire another, but I wouldn't advise this as a first or best choice. Does not equal Seward's history on the One Hundred Years War or his biography of Marie Antoinette, which I do recommend."
5,Big Phat band is the best big band ever!,"Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band is an incredible band. His charts are original and fun and the band, mostly LA studio guys, kicks butt! If you like contemporary big band, you will love this."
4,The ONLY flash for the C-3030,"The FL-40 flash is the ONLY flash that really works correctly with the C-3030Z camera. If you buy it however be sure and also get the FL-BK01 handle and FL-CB01 cable! Since the 3030 doesn't have a hot shoe like the C-2500 does. (they'll set you back another $90 or so!) This flash upgrades your digital camera for some serious photography, it is adjustable in 30 degree increments for 270 degree pointing (full right to straight back going counter clockwise). Vertically it has five steps, 0, 45, 60, 75, 90 degrees (straight up). Comes with a ""wide angle"" lens (more disperse flash). Recharge time is ok with 4 NiMh batteries but I was disappointed at the lack of an external power jack. For long setups it would be nice to run from wall power. The on-board sensor works with the camera's flash in a zillion ways, the display is easy to read and setup is pretty straight forward. With the handle and flash the camera gets to be a bit bulky."
4,"This works with the Camedia E-10, perfectly.","On the E-10, this flash is completely automatic. It adjusts appropriately throughout the zoom range. The light spread is also extremely even from edge to edge, and in the corners. The only reason I don't give it 5 starts is that is hasn't the recycle speed of many flashes in this price range. But, you can't beat the quality at any price. I also love the pivoting head. Plus, it also works in tandem with the built-in flash. A real advantage.I love this thing."
4,Good quality product,"Thank you for sending the Olympus FL-40 EXT Dedicated Flash. We are using it at this time. Our students appreciate having good equipment to rent for classes.Marla Marsh, SecretaryDigital Media & Photo Dept"
3,Helps to know Jocasta Innes works...,"I bought this book a while back. As I already own Ms Innes ""New Paint Magic"" I feel that ""Color(Around the House)"" would be most helpful as a followup but not as a sole source of information. The photography is beautiful and the book has a few very helpful suggestions about color combining techniques, but it takes a bit of imagination to be able to apply these methods."
1,So Frustrated!,Super frustrated! I have had swamp coolers before and this does not act like it should! It does not even blow cool air when it is blowing directly on my face! Please don't waste your money!
1,Defective merchandise and poor return policy.,This item has now cost me more to ship both ways than it is worth. I would not recommend this product or company to anyone. Items which don't perform should not cost anything to return.
2,Sad Case Piece of Crap,"the reviews n stars suck...i purchased this thing less then 30 days ago because of the reviews but F-Dat, this thing was a waste of my money n I am now trying to return it for a more expensive and them cheap ice-packs don't work and mixing ice with cold falsest water only last but so long when refilling this thing. THUMBS DOWN, THUMBS DOWN, THUMBS DOWN....Some u just gotta pay for."
3,WEAK,"I guess this works as advertised but it can't keep up with real heat and I only know it's on when I turn it off (if you get the drift). Basically, I think if I was in an air conditioned office that wasn't quite cool enough for me this would be a great way to go, but in a hot room that has no AC source this makes virtually no difference at all."
3,unistar review,"It is doing what I expect it to do. It was smaller than I thought, buy I should have checked the size before I ordered it. I am really glad that it is not a heavy bulky piece of equipment."
3,NICE DESIGN,THE DESIGNED FEATURES ALL WORKED AS DESCRIBED. THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED IN THE TIME FRAME ADVERTISED. I WAS AMAZED AT THE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF AIR MOVEMENT THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED USING THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL CENTER. THIS FAN HITS THE TARGET.
5,Works as advertised.,"As described by others, is not an air-conditioner but does cool my attic by several degrees that I use for dry storage."
3,It Serves its Purpose...Barely,"This unit is nothing to write home about but I guess it serves its purpose. I purchased this fan for my small studio apartment. To be honest I'm slightly disappointed. If you are looking for a medium sized unit for an office or small apartment this unit does help.That being said, don't be misled by the air cooling feature. This is not an air conditioner and will only give you slightly cooler air flow. The fan on high isn't really powerful. The two reusable ice packs are nice so that you can rotate them in. The timer control works well so that you can set it to run when you leave or go to sleep and it will continue to run for 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours. The setup and controls are very user friendly. You can get this unit up and running within 2 minutes of opening the box.I don't think I would buy this unit again. I'd probably look for something with a higher speed fan or something that cools the air a little bit better."
3,Air cooler for my room,This is the perfect size cooler for my bed room. The desk top size fits into the limited space and the timer allows for the cooler to cool my room very comfortably while I sleep. I am thinking of buying another one for my daughters room as well. Also dorms would like this cooler. I dont have control over the ac in my building so the extra cooling this gives is great.
2,Best if you do not ask,"I had purchased a slightly larger unit and was pleased. However, I thought a smaller item would be more convenient for transport. The unit did not cool as the larger one does. So, it is now in a small room running as an air purifier. I had read the reviews on this, and thought it would be ok. However, the reviewer I had read was using it as a backup in a small office. I have health issues, and I use these machines directly at me so that I can leave my home and visit in other places. Apparently, this unit was just too small to do what I needed. Perhaps like other reviewers, if you are using it as a backup in an area that is air cooled to begin with, it would work."
1,Useless Product,"I bought this air cooler to use in a dog house to provide some relief for my dogs. The dog house is approximately 4' by 6' and is 36"" high. I have a thermometer in the dog house. With ice in the tray it lowered the temperature from 90 degrees to 88 degrees for maybe an hour... As soon as the ice melted, the temperature immediately went back up to 90 degrees. The fan is very weak. It hardly produces any cooling effect at all. I would have sent it back, but the shipping charges were $20 to get it and and would probably be another $10 to $15 to ship it back. I wasn't worth the hassle. So, it's sitting in my garage and will probably end up going to the dump. You get what you pay for, as the old saying goes. I should have known better. I can't imagine this product cooling much of anything. I suppose if you put it down by your feet under a desk it might keep your feet cool if you took your shoes off."
2,Nice paper weight,"Broke after the third day of having it. it'll blow some cool air, but it's a waste of time putting ice in it because there is no difference in the temp of the air it blows. got it plugged in right now, it's blowing cool air right now. but other than that, it dont work."
1,Doesn't cool anything,"I bought this to cool my small home office. The office is on the same cooling zone as some reception rooms in my house that don't get used much and are naturally cooler, so I didn't want to run the AC for just one room. I thought this would do the job. It doesn't. It really is just a low powered fan. It might filter a little (I don't know), it might humidify a little (I don't know), but I know it doesn't cool the room."
5,Brilliant,I have never been so impressed by any work as I am with this one. I saw Marie Christine in New York and was so moved I went back to see it a second time. The recording is like curling up with a good novel that you discover something new each time you hear it again. I have much to say about Broadway's treatment of many new musicals meeting the fate that Marie Christine has -- just look back to Parade which met a similar fate. Thank you Mr. LaChuisa for your Brilliant work.
3,AUDRA IS SPECTACULAR BUT...,"Audra McDonald seems to have a jaw droppingly endless supply of talent. She never fails to give a performance any less than 300%. That said, I have to feel a bit disappointed with this show. The music, while complex, seems to be aimless and keeps the show from reaching its emotional potential. Some clumsy lyrics attract way too much attention to themselves also undercutting the dramatic tension. Anthony Crivello's miscast performance here is flat and lifeless and gets trampled by Ms. McDonalds performance. Its not as easy to be Sondheim or Bernstein as it may appear, but for the sake of musical theater I am glad to see there are people still trying."
1,Uninspired and boring,"What a terrible waste of money, I bought this CD after having read the reviews but it's just terrible. The score is dreadful, the story plain, there are no such things as ""tunes"", it is a weird compilation of even weirder songs, not to mention the terrible dialogues! This is absolutely a no-no."
1,Whatever happened to the Musical Theatre?,"Well, I've listened to this a couple of times and I'm not impressed. Like so much of what's out there now, this is toneless, self-important wind masquerading as a musical. So solemn, so important, so DULL. Folks, this show failed on Broadway. Can we hear the reasons here? I think we can have tragedy and STILL be entertained. This posturing is anything but entertaining. Pomposity is swamping the American musical, and this show is symptomatic. Sondheim at his most inaccessible sounds like Jerome Kern in comparison to this toneless, melody-parched mess."
5,What you need to know,"This collection of articles tells writers what they need to know about many of the most important business aspects of writing a book: what agents do and don't do, how their tasks differ from those of editors, how to choose and attract the interest of an agent, and why you are likely to need one. Unlike many other books published on these subjects, this one discusses recent changes in publishing with bigger conglomerates and e-publishing. Readers will get answers to questions they didn't know enough to formulate, such as specific advice about approaching editors and agents, the value of an agent who belongs to AAR (including their not charging reading fees!), information on book promotion and who does it, and some of the issues involved in self-publishing.The information here is current and clear.~review by Joan Mazza, author of six books, including Dreaming Your Real Self."
4,"Agents, Editors, and You","If you every wanted some inside information on the publishing world, Read Agents, Editor and You by Michelle Howry. First, the book gives the reader a realistic look into the publishing world. Moreover, Ms. Howry provides strong arguments for authors needing agents, they know what publishers want. Not only that, the book lets you talk to editors- interviews provide the editors prospective on the book publishing process. Most importantly, this book is for you, it informs you what you need to do in order to get your book onto the selves of the bookstores or online in e-book format."
2,"Agents, editors and you","If you have not read Writer's Market, this book will be of help.I find only two dog eared pages after reading the book. I had either read the information in it years ago in other books, or it did nothing for my main desire when I bought the book. Which was a list of reputable agents.I dog eared ""zero in on potential agents"", and that Literary agents are the exact same as an editor of days gone by, with the same heavy work load. That electronic submission was not an in thing.I live in Germany and do not have a used book store to get rid of it in. Any good book I have is full of dog ears no matter what it is. If it has no dog ears it is not a good book. I do not recomemend it."
2,Lord of Bias,"If you are interested in a critical review of the Biotech issues, this is NOT the book for you. If you are searching for arguments against GMO', big business, and pro big government; you have found a source. Daniel Charles has hidden neither his bias nor his ignorance of the subject. He draws on old studies (Monarch Butterfly larvae) and does not discuss the latest findings, because the latest findings do not support his position. He hangs adjutives on employees of the business world to ensure the reader knows they are ""evil"". The ineptness of big government is never addressed. Having served as a military officer, I can tell you that if the military had been as one-sided in dealings with Mr Charles' employer (NPR), the military would have been brought to task... It is a shame we have not discovered the gene to improve critical thinking, Mr. Charles soarly needs the modification."
4,Good book,"This book provides a good and balanced background into how Monsanto changed the face of commercial agriculture. The author manages to stay relatively neutral in the battle between the opposing biotech proponents and ""GMO free"" activists. The only ""slightly"" negative point is that the book is now about 8 years old and an update would be most appreciated!"
2,Contemparary and KOOL!!,I really enjoyed this CD the first time I listened to it. A good blend of smooth jazz with some vocals thrown in and a touch of fusion.
5,Daughter loves it,My daughter absolutely loved this dvd and so did our neighbors kids. It teaches children in a repititous fun way. I recommend this dvd.
5,My child's favorite,"My little girl loves colors and shapes. Whenever we are out in the public, she'll blurt out ""circle"" or ""red""."
4,Grows with your child,"When I put this DVD in for my granddaughter it caught her attention right away and held it for a while. My granddaughter had just turned one. The CD goes from simple to a LOT more advanced and I can see it will continue to be instrumental in her development as she grows. The colors are bright, the presentation is simple and short so kids don't get bored and the music is entertaining. The only thing I'd do different is probably wait until she was 2. But this DVD is definitely a winner in my opinion."
3,My second review of this,"(...)I have been using the bill-paying reminder system for a few months now, and I must report that I do find it useful. It is handy to have all the balances showing, month after month, so I can see the balances going down, or, God help me, going up! This makes me more aware of what I am spending, and the fact that I want all those balances to go down! I am no longer able to let myself ignore what I am doing financially. I have also noticed that one account was not crediting my payments properly.So, I am Definitely finding this item worthwhile.However, I stand behing my remarks that a more professional appearance and a rewrite of the instructions would help(...)It IS a good product, and it COULD be better.That's it!Good luck Mr. Jackson."
2,Not a monthly bill keeper.,The cover of the item makes it appear as if there are monthly dividers. In fact there are only around nine dividers and no where in the book is a page similar to the cover. The book does have the sections advertised but the cover is misleading.
1,Terrible,"What a hokey, useless waste of paper...shipping...time. Too bad. I returned it the day it arrived. That bad."
1,Very unprofessional not what I expected,I received this product and was very disappointed. It does not look like a product manufactored by a publishing company. Instead it is a bunch of photocopied pages bound the same way you would see a buisness report. I could have easily made this on my home computer. [...]
1,Bill Paying Reminder,Bill Paying Reminder and Filing SystemFor the money I could have made it myself. It is more for a younger couple starting out without a budget. I needed more.
1,This thing stinks,I have had several bill organizers and this one is the worst! The only nice thing about this organizer is that you can write your bills on the cover and change it from month to month with the dry erase marker. The set up stinks and it is cheap. NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL!!!
2,Bill Paying,I was disappointed when I recieved this product. It looked like someone had made this at home insted of a business. I could have made this same product for half the cost myself. It has photocopied pages and colored pages in slip covers. The cover is a good idea however it wipes off anytime something touches it. The pockets to sort bills are not ideal for holding important papers that need to be easily accessed. I do like the hints that they give to keep bills straight but again the price is way to high for the product you get.
4,Useful info and easy to read.,An easy read yet full of useful info. The authors explained some concepts I'd heard often but never fully understood. I'm excited about applying the concepts to my personal portfolio and my 401k.
4,Investor Starter Book,"A great book for those of us that want to know where our money can work for us but never really had the time to learn. This easy to read, easy to follow book brings the high level investing game to a more understandable level to help you get a better feeling of how the markets work. You have to start someplace and this book is a nice addition to your library for those that want to learn. I also purchased ""Investing for Dummies"" but I would start with this book first since it's more of a front-to-back reader and not as much of a reference book. For the price, it's a great value."
3,More bad than good.,This book on investing in the market is well written no doubt about that. The authors know their chosen subject well or so it seems. But do they really? My opinion is no. This book is only worth two and a half stars to me. While it's well written the authors have been proven laughable wrong since the year 2004 when the book was written. Since writing in 2004 the market has lost over 45 percent in one year. That year was 2008. The market did reboud in early 2009 however from 2009 until Novemeber 2011 the market is treading water and it's actually down about 2 percent since early 2009. What kind of timing is that. Terrible. That is like telling people in September 1987 to invest 60 percent of their retirement funds in the stock market.
2,Not the usual Eyre standard,"I love the Eyres' parenting books. Except this one.The book switches back and forth between remarks from the authors' several grown children and the authors' advice. I got the impression that a lot of the time, the kids were trying to tell their parents to leave them alone and not get so worked up about their lives. If I was getting this feeling reading the kids' words as interpreted into their parents' book, it makes me wonder what was really said!One of the pieces of advice the Eyres give is to purchase a vacation home where all the family can gather. Really? Just how many people could afford to do that? Not me, even if my kids lived near enough to make justifiable use of such a place.I felt generally discouraged and overwhelmed by the advice in this book. I know the Eyres are wonderful parents and mean well. But I found very little I could apply to my own relationship with my grown children. My advice is, read it but don't expect a lot."
3,"Good cover, wrong description though.","The book arrived on time and even though it was used, the cover was in really good condition. But the description didn't mention there was high lighting in the book and that kinda threw me off cause I don't like highlighted books. All in all, good service."
4,Good resource,This is a good book with helpful information relating to assessment procedures for school counselors.
5,Assessment Procedures for Counseling,"I am a very happy customer with my purchase. I not only received my book REALLY fast and literally in 3 days, but the book was in excellent condition (purcahsed used book). VERY happy, I was able to save a lot of money compared to other companies and I would definately purchase again on Amazon! I saved over $50.00!!"
1,Good for insomnia,"If I didn't need this book for a class that I'm taking, I would never have purchased it. The material is very dry and mundane. Every time I try to read a chapter for my class I end up falling asleep."
1,Poor condition of book,I paid $101.00 for a book that was in TERRIBLE condition. There were stains on the pages with some torn. It had been highlighted and pen marks all over it! Very disappointed in the quality of this product!! Brand new it only sells for $108. This is far from acceptable condition for that price!!
1,Many critical typos,"This book is not for people who do not understand statistics because there are typos in the book on important things such as definitions, answers to stats formulas, and in addition, the associated on-line grading chapter questions. Page 39 is just one example. The explanation of a Z-score has a typo. Below that, the example formula of a T-score is incorrect. Trying to figure this stuff out has been beyond frustrating. I do not recommend this book until they fix the published errors."
4,Back edition saves $,"This text was required for a course I took on appraisal and assessment procedures. I decided to buy the 5th edition because it was much, much cheaper than the current edition (which I believe is the 7th). The fifth edition shares most of the same information as the newest edition (i did a comparison of the two when I purchased, then returned the most recent text from the school book store). The chapters aren't in the same order, but unless you're being tested on the text book verbatim, it's not necessary to spend the extra cash."
4,Drummond's textbook,"Students whose field of studies will take them into research and/or testing procedures should consider this book. It covers the historical and philosophical foundationsof testing, the ethical issues involved, and goes into great detail on all the statistical aspects of appraisal. Parts of it are over my head but this is due to my poor math background rather than the author's style and content."
3,"Kip vs. The ""A"" Bomb","This dark tale delivers the strongest argument against ""one person can make a difference""conceivable.It's overall theme of being pathetic describes the book's author's ability to enlighten.The Booker Prize appears to be a booby one"
4,Nirvana is great.,"Nirvana didnt ruin rock and roll, MTV did i agree with you, todays version of rock and roll isnt the same as the classical rock from the 60's 70's and some of the 80's but it wasnt nirvana at all, nirvana could even be considered a classic, at least to me they are, linkin park isnt that bad but i wouldnt call what they are singing rock and roll, i think it would be nice if we saw some more people like Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Pink Floyd, Bachman Turner Overdrive, ZZ Top...just some of the greatest rockers we know, overall this cd is pretty good....ohh, and 1 more thing, im only 13 and i can tell you all of this because i lived throughout the 70's, not in person but in spirit i could tell you most of the things that happened, adn the 70's never died and never will some of the longest bands that ever stayed together were all ROCKERS!"
5,Totally and Absolutely Sheer Amazment,"Oh my gosh. This is one of the best cds ever!!! Buy it now. My faves are: You Know Your Right, Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, Dumb, All Apologies, and The Man Who Sold the World. Of course, not to insult the cd or anything, but I got an awesome deal because my friend Nicole burned it for me due to her complete obsession with Nirvana( like eating strawberries, dedicating her round of golf to Kurt, and buying me a rad poster of them for my birthday) Listen to me:BUY THIS CD NOW!!!! YOU WILL BE SOOOO GLAD YOU DID!!!!!!"
1,Crap compilation,"I admit, the songs are decent, but the remixing of the songs suck.Smells Like Teen Spirit has too much bass, for example.Anyway, you should buy the albums rather than compilations."
1,KURT COBAIN IS TURNING IN HIS GRAVE,"Everyone who buys this is taking a big GIANT ... on this bands legacy. Kurt Cobain wore a shirt that said ""corporate magazines still suck"" on the cover of rolling stone. Come on now, ""I know you're right"" is a great song but don't spend your [$$$] for a cleverly packaged single. I guess Grohl and Novoselic just didn't want to deal with that horrible excuse of a person in court anymore. So they let Courtney love completely bastardize the legacy of this awesome band by ripping off all Nirvana fans. Thank God ""i know you're right"" was leaked onto the internet."
5,Nirvana will always be remembered,"This greatest hits collection I really like but as many others said some songs were left out. All the songs on this album were great and thats why I give it 5 stars however it could have went above and beyond if they had added:BlewLove BuzzAneurysmSon Of A GunDrain YouPolly(Nevermind version)Scentless ApprenticeAll Apologies(In Utero version, include Unplugged version)Where Did You Sleep Last Night?Pennyroyal Tea(Unplugged)Now in my mind they should have made this a double disc set but what can you do and I also feel that the album did not glorify such great albums as Bleach and Incesticide. All in all great album and Nirvana will always be remembered. R.I.P Kurt!! 67-94"
3,decent nirvana cd,before i start my review i want to say that the reviewer known as the they cant ban me is actually an alias for the cranky reviewer who keeps slamming great rock bands like pink floyd and the eagles andcountering a cetain reviewer known as terrence.j reardons reviews everyday.please ignore the reviewer called( they cant ban me)'s biased and senseless reviews.get this cd along with pearl jams ten.
3,not for the true fan,"if you were alive and kicking and screaming in the early nineties than you probably have most of the songs on this cd. it is a well produced cd And YKYR is one awesome song(yes i bought this for YKYR alone) but if you already own nevermind, in utero, bleach, and/or the unplugged, then you have this cd. i find the songs are great but if you want to get into nirvana then this is a fine begginning,(although i say buy the actual albums starting at bleach)i think we can sum up a review of this album in two sentences. if you own a handful of nirvana albums then skip this (unless you want YKYR). if your just starting a nirvana collection, then this is a well worthwhile purchase."
4,Nice selection of songs....,"Ever since I got this album, don't get me wrong, I really like it. I listen to it all of the time, I've even imported all of the songs into the computer that I use in school.But I, like many, felt there weren't enough songs on here to showcase all Nirvana's brilliance and talent. Some good ones I thought were missing:Pay to Play (rarity)Chorus Verse Chorus (rarity)Big Cheese (Bleach)Love Buzz (Bleach)Aneurysm (Incesticide)Dive (Incesticide)Breed (Nevermind)Drain You (Nevermind)Polly (Nevermind)Something in the Way (Nevermind)Plateau (Unplugged)I have all of those songs on a Nirvana burnt disc I made. I just think many others should hear these (especially the older ones from Bleach and the rarities; ones they've probably never heard).But overall, nothing really more to complain about. All of their best and biggest hits are all on here."
2,Short changes the Fans,this is a Greatest Hits Album that still feels so Cheap&missing elements that I can't quite put into full Perspective.One New Song.Nirvana was a Band that while I wasn't crazy about there Albums on a WHole Fully weren't a Singles Act either.Kurt Cobain could really write Lyrics.but something about this Presentation seems like a Cheap Sell.they would be better served with a Box Set or something that fully tells&speaks of them than this Compilation.
3,14 songs only!,"Only for diehard fans of the late grunge group Nirvana would this album since it includes an unreleased track called You Know Your Right which was the last track record by the group before Kurt's suicide in 1994. For only having 14 songs it should of had more like Negative Creep, Slappy, Scentless Apprentice, Drain You, Polly. The rest of the tracks on the album like In Bloom, Smells like teen spirit, Lithium, Rape me, Heartshape Box, About a girl, Been a son, all apologizes, the man who sold the world, pennyroyal tea can be found in Beach, Nevermind, and In Utero plus Unplugged album. There is no need for this album unless you want almost all of the hits with a few missing. It looks like Dave, Courtney, and Chris were just looking for a quick cash in and just throw this collection whoever did, I think it was Courtney mostly. It should of had videos or interview with Dave, Chris and former members of the band talking about Nirvana or at least live footage of the band."
3,"Alright, not amazing","This is a decent compilation. I am of the mind that compilations, by nature, are evil. Even so, this CD would be a nice jumping-off point for someone unfamiliar with the band. There are a lot of great songs on here, but there are also a lot of great songs that you're missing out on if this is all you have from Nirvana.You could buy this CD, it's not really a bad purchase. I'd just assume go buy the individual albums though."
1,Only get this if you really want it.,"This was the first Nirvana Album I got, and I loved it then. But then I got all the other Nirvana albums, and this collection suddenly sucked. This is why it gets the consolation prize on my list:BleachIncesticideIn UteroWith the Lights Out (Box Set w/ CD and DVD)MTV Live in New YorkFrom the Muddy Banks of WishkahNevermindNirvana (The Greatest Hits Album)There are songs on here that could be replaced for better songs, and much, much more could be added. These are all the mainstream songs Kurt wrote when he was feeling ""Pop-ish."" Only get this if you must have it, but it is not essential to your collection."
4,Very good CD.,"At first i did not like this band, but now i like it a lot! I heard heart-shaped box on Guitar Hero II. And songs from the radio station KROQ 106.7 so i heard the CD. And i got it. My favorite tracks are tracks. 2, 3, 7, 9, its is a good CD."
3,Not as good as it ought to be,"This is merely a fistful of Nirvana's most overplayed songs thrown together on a CD. It doesn't flow well as an album and isn't really a great selection of songs either. About half came from In Utero and I would highly recommend that you purchase that instead. It flows infinitely better and consequently the same songs sound better on it. Also, it has the electric version of ""All Apologies"" whereas this has the unplugged, which isn't as effective in my opinion.If you are looking to listen to all those Nirvana songs you keep hearing on the radio every couple of hours in one sitting, this album is for you. If you're looking for an album that is more than the sum of is parts and a good representation of Nirvana's talents, look elsewhere."
3,Disappointing,"Why isn't Verse Choruse Verse on here as well as the Studio version of All Apologies. I also think Polly should have been included along with Breed and On a Plain. If Kurt Cobain were alive this release would have never happened. This undermines Nirvana's legacy. Keep in mind the disc is also only 50 minutes long which means these other songs could have been included. I just don't understand some of the decisions that are made in the record industry. Thanks Courtney Love. Also, the remastering is too bassy and heavy. On a higher note bonus points for including the 1994 remix of Penny Royal Tea and the unplugged version of Man Who Sold the World."
3,what a disgrace,"k. cobain would be spinning in his grave if he knew this had been released (and if he had a grave he was cremated). there is no way in hell that nirvanas greatness can be sumed up in 14 songs. the ONLY reason this was released was for the very first song ""you know youre right"" which was the last track that cobain laid down in the studio with nirvana. the track was supposed to be on the ""with the lights out"" compilation but courtney ""yoko"" love got in the way and put her two cents in which nobody wanted and started a fu c king mess saying that the song was too important to just be released on a compilation of demos and b-sides so they essentially made up a greatest hits album for the sole purpose of releasing that one song. cash cow anyone? kurt should have never hooked up with that gold-digging heffer."
2,Sad...,"Talk about anti-climactic, this CD was all pomp and little circumstance. As old school grunge rock fans waited with bated breath for the the release of Nirvana's last recorded track a new generation of industrial rock fans wondered what all the fuss was about. The result, an embarassing walk down memory lane with songs that teens have already heard over and over again. To say that this disc was done to death would be kind. Classic Nirvana repackaged in hype just doesn't cut it."
2,-,"This compilation feels rather pointless. First of all I don't like the fact that their last recorded song (""you know you're right"") is the first song while all the rest is in chronological order. Is it just marketing? ""You know you're right"" isnt a bad song either, but I dont feel that it's ""best of"" material. The rest of the songs are pretty good although I think that a better selection could have been made."
3,It's okay,"It's okay, but it could be better. I you are a Nirvana fan, stick with thier real albums, not greatest hits. If you are a casual fan, get this."
4,Slightly Disappointed,"I have been a Nirvana fan for quite some time now, and I couldn't wait to buy this CD. But when the track listing was posted on the internet, I was shock that the CD only contained 14 songs. I could have easily chosen many more songs to place on the CD. If this CD was meant to be a greatest hits collection, it definently was not. Nirvana was one of the greatest bands ever and they have more than 14 hits.On a lighter note, I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because no matter what, the songs that actually were included on this CD are amazing. The songs themselves deserve 5 stars. After hearing many people comment on this CD, you can pick out the true Nirvana fans from the fans who really know anything about the band; because a true fan knows that this is by far a pathetic excuse of a greatest hits."
3,you know you're right,"to tell you the truth a was a little let down, by this cd. I mean the new unreleased track is great, I love it, but the whole CD just seemed a little empty to me I mean dont get me wrong all the tracks on here are great but, it feels like this cd was thrown together in a day or so just to get some bucks.This CD was made to be the dummy's guide to Nirvana, like some kid that just discovered them made a burned CD of their ""good"" songs. I would say for people like myself that love the band dont bother buying this cd. If you havent heard you know you you're right then go download it off the internet and save some bucks. For those of you that havent heard Nirvana and want to get into them, start off by buying Nevermind and work you're way up, trust me it would be better that way. I give it 3 stars for the unreleased track...but it should have more of them."
1,"Hmm, what a definitive Nirvana collection","I love nirvana, let's get that out of the way first. I am one of the people who has been following ""You Know You're Right"" since it was a live bootleg called ""On A Mountain"". This collection irritates me to no end. ""Been a Son"" is, in my opinion, the single worst Nirvana song. On the other hand, I giggled when I saw that ""Sliver"" and ""Dumb"" were included. My major beef though, is that this is not even close to a comprehensive look into what Nirvana was capable of. ""Francis Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle"", ""Very Ape"", ""Aneurysm"", and ""On A Plain"" could have been added without even making the thing into a two disc set, which would have been a little bit less of a slap in the face to Nirvana die-hards. I don't mean to flame and be a troll. Apologies."
1,Stupid & unecessary compilation,"What are Geffen record trying to sell. One song!! Most fans will have Never mind and In Utero and 9 songs are from these 2 albums. what is the point of this release ??? Guess they want to make money by selling bad stuff. First media turns Cobain as a hero.. and he gets lot of attention for shooting himself. how coward and stupid it is. Wake up people.. we have better bands than Nirvana like Pearl Jam, soundgarden and AIC. They have got to much credit for producing worthless records. It took me 10 years of denial that Nirvana sucks. I really don't care for this record personally. This CD should have been marketed as a 2 disc. other disc containing B-sides. This is a complete example of lazyness. first they have 4 songs from Never mind and then 5 songs continuous from InUtero. What kind of mixing is this? Stay away from this. Everyone has all the songs!!! I still love unplugged and Never mind.."
4,Nirvana at its best!,"This is a fine collection of Nirvana, no doubt! I love just about every song on the Cd. If you don't have any of Nirvana's Cd's buy this one! You will love it."
4,"An awesome band, overrated band.","Nirvana are simply an awesome band, and this is a great album to own if you haven't heard Nirvana before, but it could still use a LOT more songs then this. In any case, this cd contains most of their best songs, so it's good disc for newbies. Like I said, Nirvana is a great band, but they are simply overrated because there were many bands like them during their time that just did not get the recognition like Nirvana did. In any case, Nirvana will always be remembered for getting rid of that glam rock ..., with the exception of Guns and Roses, who still kick ***. By the way, ""You Know Your Right"", is one kick-*** song."
4,All The Hits,"Not a perfect album with song choices, but a good collection of most of Nirvana's hits. A few problems I have with this album: 1. Their first single Love Buzz is not included here. 2. The Unplugged version of All Apoligies is used instead of the In Utero version which is the one which reached number one of Billboard's Modern Rock charts. While not perfect, this album does do the job of collecting most of Nirvana's hits, including You Know Your Right. This may be a great place for new fans to start or for the casual listener who just wants most of the hits. However, I recommend that if you get into Nirvana to also buy their studio albums as well to get a full sense of this band."
3,Good compilation,"I gave this CD only 3 stars since most Nirvana fans already have all their albums and YKYR. I bought this to complete my Nirvana collection. All the songs here are remastered, so they sound brilliant. If your just getting into Nirvana and don't own a single album by them then this would be a good cd to start with. There should have been more unreleased songs on here thats my only complaint. You do get all their hits on one disc. Go out and pick this up!"
2,blah...,"I guess you can't really criticize this release too much, for it is practically impossible to make a Nirvana greatest hits compilation that would satisfy everyone. Because for a Nirvana fan almost every song would seem to have a potential to be on Greatest Hits. Besides, Nirvana did not release too many albums altogether, so if you are a new fan in my opinion it's better to just go and get their albums, and if you are an old fan then you already have all those songs, except ""You know you're right"". That song is OK; I wouldn't say it is one of the 'greatest hits', and I would just suggest downloading it instead of buying the whole disk and contributing to record companies' undeserved unspeakable wealth.Of course, the great thing would be a (preferably two disk) compilation of rarities, bootlegs, live versions, etc etc. But the record companies would never release such thing, wouldn't they..."
3,Cheap Thrills,"This album is a cheap way for the people that really got into ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" to get their Nirvana fix. If you really like Nirvana, then you already own all the albums and all you need to do is download ""You Know You're Right"" off the internet. I don't think Kurt would have let this one get released if he was still alive. However, the songs are great, this album just doesn't contain all the greatest hits, just the popular ones."
4,*Tear* What this brings back...,"Nirvana was one of the greatest bands of all time. They are this for two reasons: One-The passion in the words and the music played.Two-Kurt Cobain.I believe that this is a great album for those who have recently found Nirvana. It should be called ""Songs That are Well Known""It should include more for the avid fan. ""Something in the Way"", ""Aneurysm"", ""On a Plain"" and many more should have been included but it is a great collection anyway.The new track ""You Know Your Right"" is great. It makes my heart pound everytime I hear it. I am so glad that a new song was added because it makes it seem like Kurt is still here. And as physco as that sounds, thats a nice feeling to have."
4,I wish this album never had to come out,"What I mean is, Nirvana ceased to be at the highlight of their days. It's such a same this album had to see the light of day.If you are a Nirvana fan, this is a must get. The new song is supurb, and the old music sounds better than ever re-mastered. It brings me back to those days in the 7th grade when I first discovered Nirvana, listening to their Cassette Tapes on the bus!We all love and miss Kurt, and this album does his memory justice."
5,This have never been so swell.....,"Folks, I waited 2 years for this album to come out, and I was the first one to buy it at the local music store here, just past midnight on Tuesday. Anyone who is even a moderate Nirvana fan is going to want this album, as it contains 14 songs you are sure to want. If you already have all of Nirvana's albums, you're still going to want to add this to your collection. 'You know you're Right' is a new classic song by Nirvana...it's haunting music and lyrics fit right into this wonderful collection of music...so, as I like to say....do yourself a favor, and buy the best CD of the year so far!"
3,"Good songs, but only for Nirvana-dabblers","The reviewer below is an awful excuse for a fan of Nirvana. Kurt preached empathy, and then you've got hanz below saying he wants to hunt donwn anyone who thinks Kurt was selfish for killing himself. This person's the prime example of why we have road rage and mental facilities. I think it'd be more ""therapudic"" for us all if we didn't have such wackos like hanz in society. Anyway, Nirvana's greatest hits album is a decent buy for everyone BUT Nirvana's fanbase that appreciates the band's more unconventional material like ""Hairspray Queen"" and ""Anorexorcist"". If you're like me and can see the beauty in these two insanity-laden noizfests, then don't buy this greatest hits release, because I'm sure you aleady have ""YKYR"". God, I miss Kurt."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM,"Reasons NOT to buy:1. there is only 1 new song2. been a son and sliver are not good songs.They have horrible lyricsWhat you SHOULD BUY:Buy Nevermind, In Utero, and Unplugged to getall the good songsDo Not Buy: Bleech, Incesticide, and From the Muddy..."
1,Major Let Down,"What a Major dissapointment...they cleaned up allt he tracks..they don't have that gritty, dirty basement sound that made Nirvana and Grunge... they might have as well read did Kurts voice so you could understand every word coming out of his mouth. This album sound slike a POP album not Nirvana. Be better off buying all their albums...you get a ton of better songs that weren't even on this album."
5,A Compilation To Own,"For some reason I never even knew this album existed. It's basically a ""Best Of"" compilation with the last recorded song with Kurt on it. For a pretty good collective of the music landscape changing geniuses, this is pretty good. For a cheap starting point I would recommend the first two albums but for any not sure of where to go with Nirvana, this is an excellant CD including ""The Man Who Sold The World"" and ""Rape Me"" - that is for sure, one of my all time fav performances by Nirvana."
2,Time To Cement The Legend and Milk It Dry,"The remaining members of Nirvana wanted the bands previously unreleased gem ""You Know You're Right"" to be released with a batch of other rarities in a box set of ""new"" material. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, wanted to be able to use Nirvana's name and the much-hyped new tune as a bargaining chip in a new deal with Universal Records. She won in the courts, and now the song has been tacked on as the obligitory new track on a collection of 13 songs that have been released and heard a million times before.Nirvana doesn't lend itself well to compilation because they only released 3 albums that each sound very, very different. It's not very expensive and a much more rewarding decision to buy each of the three albums rather than this cheesy ""Greatest Hits"" record, something it's hard to imagine a living Kurt Cobain authorizing. The songs are good, but a lot of the groups best work is missing here and the arrangement leaves a lot to be desired."
1,STEAL THIS SONG,"If you are using a computer right now, and I'm sure you are, you have access to YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT via KAZAA or whatever. You already own the NIRVANA library of studio releases, do not waste your money on this [stuff]. The ""new"" song is not that great anyway, it's actually depressing how dated it sounds. This collection of his is redundant. If you want a great retrospective of an important band, produced by a record company that actually cares enough to give fans what they want, then go for the PAVEMENT S&E REDEUX. Don't give more money to these fat cats and their attourneys! Wait until those 100+ tapes surface. You owe it to NIRVANA not to buy into this money making ploy, don't you? Krist didn't want this, Dave didn't want this, Kurt didn't want this... by now you've already arranged to have it shipped to you; lemming, I pray for your soul."
1,SMELLS LIKE ...,"Look, Nirvana's back! The most over-rated band of the last 20 years. Already MTV, VH1 and the rest of the media are promoting this album like crazy. Back in the early 90's, MTV and the media brainwashed the kids into thinking that it is cool to like Nirvana and other ""grunge"" groups. And so it happened!This band killed rock n' roll, they paved the way for other bands with no talent, sense of melody or intelligent lyrics. And so we went through a very dark decade in music.I can't imagine how anyone can actually enjoy listening to depressing lyrics screamed over monotonous droning guitars. I guess the people that enjoy this stuff are the same ones who think that Kurt Cobain is a ""genius.""The media says that Nirvana killed off the so-called ""hair bands."" Well, twenty years later Def Leppard and Bon Jovi have new albums out and are still touring. How many ""grunge"" bands are still around and relevant today?The ""grunge"" era is a time that would be better off forgotten."
3,Essential Grunge,"Finally, after years of record company fighting, Nirvana has released a tight disc of all their essential grunge-rock classics - their greatest hits, if you will.And it's long overdue.Since their regular albums were always frought with major problems, it's good to have just one disc with all their radio hits, classics like ""Smells Like Teen"" Spirit"" and ""Come As You Are.""Though they'll never match the level of the Foo Fighters (Nirvana's old opening/partner band), Nirvana still had a good run back in the early 90s. How many other bands can claim they started a little known movement known as ""punk rock""? Not only that, but they also began the underground grunge movement, which has been carried on even today by the likes of better bands like Creed, Nickelback, and Limp Bizkit.Well, thanks a lot....."
1,Just What Kurt Would NOT Have Wanted,"With a wife like Courtney and bandmates like Krist and Dave it's no wonder Kurt felt alone in this world. Now that these 3 are collaborating on making money off a guy who had so much integrity he killed himself cause he believed he was becoming a fake Rock Star, I hope everyone can see just how despicable this is. NO, NO, NO, Kurt would not have been happy about this. He would not be happy that his last studio recording is being used to sell a greatest hits collection that serves no purpose other than crass commercialism - THAT should NOT be Kurt Cobain's legacy."
2,Not that great...,"Nirvana is one of my favorite bands, but this cd isn't very impressive. It's supposed to be like a greatest hits type thing... I could list about 20 songs they left off. The whole ""digitally remastering"" isn't cool, it makes the songs sound different. Don't get me wrong, all of the songs on this album are great, but there is a lot more they could have fit on. If you're just getting in to Nirvana and want to buy one of their cd's... get Nervermind or In Utero. They are a lot better than this. If you want it, get your friend to burn it for you or download it off ... Don't waste your money on this."
3,This Wasn't Needed...By Anyone,"I am actually a big fan of the greatest hits package. Many artist will never make a great album. Just ask Iggy after he left Stooges(with the exception of ""The Idiot""), and his greatest hits record is all right. But Nirvana? In the small time that they were recording tunes, they put out great records. Therefore, this record is here to supply Courtney Love.The song choices are fairly obvious, mainly consisting of the radio hits that have been mainstays on the radio for a good decade, and one new song, ""You Know You're Right"". Why not just put that new song out on a single so I don't have to buy this? I refuse to pay fifteen dollars for one new song, you hear me Courtney?So, please, just go and buy the Nirvana records. Each one of them---with the exception of ""Incesctiside"" ehich is decent but like all B-Sides comps, hit or miss---are flawless records that cement the time and place where they were recorded."
3,WE'RE STUCK WITH THIS????,"alright, first off, im a kid. so i wasnt old enough to enjoy Nirvana while they were intact, but when i heard of a new album, i was expecting a rarities album with great unreleased songs like bambi slaughter, pencapchew, in his hands, talk to me, and of course all of the screw-up tracks of kurt in his room and all of that. but NOOO that money-obsessed courtney love stuck us with ONE new unreleased song, that isnt good anyway, and songs we allready own. sorry new fans, go buy Bleach or Incesticide if you want nirvana's best."
1,Pointless,"I hate Greatest Hits albums, especially ones with almost nothing original to offer, released only to make money.BOYCOT THIS ALBUM. If you want Nirvana get all the studio albums (except for Bleach if you only like their hits)What the hell is ""You know you're right"" doing here, it should have been on the boxset!!!"
1,what a waste,come on. 14 songs that all nirvana fans have and 1 tune you can download from the net? talk about being hungry for money. This CD and Kurt's journal are the last intent to suck blood out of his poor body. The video of you know you're right is morbid. Kurt is long gone and they are trying to bring it back to the new generation. Leave him rest in peace!
3,A lame attempt to squeeze a couple of bucks out of the fans.,"First of all: all the songs here are great, no doubt. But the disc has only one new song, which wasn't released on single (I wonder why:( ) There are quite some good songs out there that haven't been available to most fans previously, like Oh the guilt, Sappy or D-7, that SHOULD have made it to this album, but didn't. Yes, you are being ripped off. Get the original albums and don't touch this one with a ten foot pole. Five stars for the songs, one for relevance or the release."
4,Why the good stuff never lasts.......,"From a musical genius and his pioneering band comes this awesome ""hit bunch"". I got this solely for their unreleased single because I own all of the other albums. This band stood out like beacon and shines rather brightly till today. Today we remember Kurt on his 10th Death Anniversary and I shall just headbang to the way I did in the 90's to the anthem which still ""....smells like teen spirit!""A definite addition to your Nirvana collection.Rest In Peace Kurt. You are missed."
3,Great if you want to get into Nirvana,"As I said in the title, this album is great if you want to get into Nirvana and learn about this awesome band, but it doesn't do justice for those waiting 10 years for new Nirvana material. Don't get me wrong, the new song and remasters are awesome, but this 14 track disc only shows you the ""radio friendly"" side(except for maybe ""Sliver"" and ""About a Girl""). This is a great collection of Nirvana songs, but there is a lot more material that was left out. Songs I wish were on this disc- the Intesticide standout, ""Aneurysm"", Nirvana's first single, ""Love Buzz"", the energetic ""Territorial Pissings"", the acoustic ""Polly"", plus ""School"", ""Molly's Lips"", and ""Scentless Apprentice"". There are a lot more but I can't think of them. Again, this CD is great for new listeners. Peace out."
4,Back from the dead and better than ever,"Well lets see ive been waiting for this album for a long time so now that it has finnaly come out i am very happy to say that it was worth the waitFirst off the album starts off with the new song ""you know your right"" which is a sad song since it is the last album that nirvana ever made, then the rest of the album is old song that you heard before but are so good that you well listen to them againBasicly if you have no Nirvana albums get this one first cause it the best of there music, and if you own all there album before this dont be ashamed about paying 15 dollars for this new song it worth it."
3,"""You Know You're Right""","The only strength that this album has is the unreleased song ""you know you're right."" That's the only reason I give it three stars; because it's one of my favorite Nirvana songs. Aside from the one new track,(instead of many many more - courtesy of courtney love)this album is a bad greatest hits compilation. It doesn't include many of Nirvana's best material plus it's fifteen dollars for one f#%&in' song. If you have all of the Nirvana albums, then just download ""you know you're right"" and save your money."
3,Strangely lacking...,"There's great Nirvana songs on here, don't get me wrong, and 'You Know You're Right' is well worth the price of the cd alone (in my opinion at least). But they could've included so much more. Tracks like 'Blew', 'Love Buzz', 'Big Cheese', 'Dive', 'Anuerysm', 'Stain', 'Paper Cuts', 'Scentless Apprentice', and 'On a Plain' are all missing. Other rare tracks could've been included, namely 'Oh, the Guilt' and 'Sappy'. If you really want to, you could buy this. But other than that, just download 'You Know You're Right'"
1,greatest hits?,"There's really no reason to buy this cd. If you like Nirvana you probably already have all the songs on this cd already. If you don't, then do yourself a favor and buy the albums the songs first appeared on. The only reason I could see to buy this cd would be for You Know Your Right. But since the money obviously isn't going to Mr. Cobain, and since everyone around him have been acting like greedy, squabbling idiots, I see no reason you shouldn't just steal that track off a file sharing program.(and it is stealing). And while your on there take a listen to some other rare songs that can't be found on a release, such as, Moist Vagina, Sappy, Clean up Before She Comes, and Opinion. They're all worth a listen"
3,Not Necessarily for the avid Nirvana Fan,"True as it may be that this album gives listeners the newly released ""You Know Your Right"" recording; the album as a whole leaves a lot to be desired by any heartful Nirvana fan. Money might be better spent on ""Insesticide"" or ""Bleach""."
4,The Classics,"What else is there to say? For all the Nirvana fans...All their greatest songs with the previously unreleased ""You know you're right"". Good songs from a band that is now part of rock history. The only bad thing I can say about this is that record companies are basically coming out with this cd for marketing purposes only: all these songs (but one) can be found on the other Nirvana cd's the fans own anyway. Buy this if you don't have a cd burner is the basic message, or if you would die of knowing your Nirvana cd collection isn't complete yet."
3,"""Nirvana""","This ""album"" I do not like is a theft direct your face has the same songs as the other albums"
1,What's The Point.,The only reason I could fathom buying this would be if your after the unreleased song. Other then that I just don't see a reason to purchase this. I strongly suggest buying the albums vs. this. There is no way that a greatest hits cd is going to truly represent this band.Please buy the albums and not this.
3,One Song,"On the plus side: You Know You're Right is as good as anything Nirvana ever did and demands to be cranked. For this song alone, this is a must buy.On the minus side: the Scott Litt remix of Pennyroyal Tea did nothing for me, the In Utero version remains definitive.If you are a fan, you have all their albums anyway and this set is almost pointless. In the wise words of Bruce McCulloch from Kids in the Hall, ""Greatest hits albums are for housewives and little girls""."
3,"""NIRVANA""","Like many other reviews here , if you own NEVERMIND or IN UTERO you really don't need the cd. But if your're a die hard NIRVANA fan like me , then by all means buy it! It's a great collection of all the hits that made them famous like.....""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". Another thing that cought my eye was that ""Dumb"" was on here. It's a good song in my point of view but, I don't think it was a HUGE hit with the mainstream audience. If you're just getting into NIRVANA I highly recommend this CD. But if you want to take a chance I'd try IN UTERO or BLEACH. Don't be afraid to try something other than NEVERMIND. If you do buy NEVERMIND it's like buying the greatest hits. But then again not everybody likes NIRVANA , they'd rather listen to STAIND..."
3,What was the criteria?,"Nirvana was not a band that had a bunch of 'greatest hits'. Yes, you have 'teen spirit, 'come as you are', 'lithium' and maybe a couple other that cracked the top 20. But what about the rest of the tracks? Who choose them and why? No 'Polly', 'Serve the servants'; only 14 tracks? Lately some artists have allowed their fans to chose the album tracks for their 'hits' compilations, and guess what, the compilations work. Not only they work but they are certified if you could say so, by the people who care about the artist or know about the band. At this point, I'd rather have a compilation made by Nirvana fans than by Courtney Love."
2,Nirvana for Dummies,"This CD is like Nirvana for Dummies. Any true Nirvana fan couldn't stomach it. It's basically all the tracks MTV pounded into the masses. The easy ones to sing along to. The tracks that I'm sure any true Nirvana fan at this points skips over when he or she plays the original albums. Look, Nirvana rocked and every track Kurt spewed out was exceptional, including the included. I just think that this CD fales to capture the essence of the band. Nirvana had a lot of more range than this CD demonstrates. They took alot of risks. Ingenious risks. Nonetheless, I will admit that this cd is a pretty good introductory course. Let's just hope there's a PART II.(Kudos on the sound quality, though. Clear & Crisp)"
1,truly...a waste...,"If you havent heard of nirvana by now, you shouldnt even be reading this. If you have, you probly would have bought one of their albums by now, assuming you liked what you heard. This, however, is a silly purchase. One new song... one...which im sure you can find on the internet. Its a mockery to nirvana and is really just a money scheme for the record company. Nirvana would NEVER release this in their right mind. So if you like nirvana and support what they stood for then dont buy this album, nirvana isnt getting a penny for it....plus the track listing really stinks..."
1,"""Listening to it makes me like it"" attests one Nirvana fan","I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves. They'd do anything for ""Kurdt"" and are easily-lead. Just look at the how they say ""listening to it makes me like it"". If you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day, would you enjoy THAT? Same concept with these songs. People like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment. Just because you've heard something before isn't necessarily grounds for you to like it."
1,Better Measure Your Hose,This adapter does not fit anything that I could find. The outside diameter is exactly the same diameter as a standard shop vac hose. The small end outside diameter is the exact same diameter as the dust port of every Bosch tool that I own. In other words it won't fit any Bosch tool without an additional adapter. Neither end will fit either over or inside of anything I have in my shop. This is a completely useless piece of plastic unless you also have other adapters or are using a household vacuum cleaner in your shop. Who does that?? Don't waste your money.
4,2 1\2 Inch Hose adapter,Product is as advertised and works well adapting between the 2 1\2 Inch Craftsman hose to the smaller hoses that came with my Shop-Vac.
1,conncetion to Bosch surface grinder,"I may not know how to use this connector but the size on both ends of this connector do not fit into any equipment. The small end do not fit into the connector comes with the Bosch grinder and the large end not not fit into my vaccume hose. I have to use tape to put them together and many time the tape came off and dust flies, I think Bosch should a better connector with locking mechanism so the connector and hose will not separate."
5,"Lovely, informative book","What a lovely book! Engrossing illustration of a way of life destroyed by the Chinese conquerors. I love reading Buddhist writings, but I think this would appeal even to those who are not interested in Buddhism, as Harrer seems to be not particularly religious and he concentrates on the everyday life of Tibetans in Lhasa."
5,quirky and memorable,"I am most intrigued seeing reviews of this ""Italian American"" score when it has been used almost exclusively for UK related movies, i.e. the entire Jeeves (British) series and the fairly recent Mickey Blue Eyes, whose lead is also a Brit."
4,A Trip Down Memory Lane,I remember listening to Patience and Prudence at my Grandmother's house. She had an album with various songs by various artists and I'd always play it when we visited. It brings back alot of good memories. This album is a gentle reminder of the way things used to be and I will always cherish it. Thanks so much for the trip down memory lane.
4,so cute!,"This cd is very precious (the lost third member?). The obvious singles on here are 'Tonight You Belong to Me' and 'A Smile and a Ribbon.' If you like those two little ditties, you're sure to like the rest of the album. I play this when I'm feeling down and it makes me think of rainbows and sunshine."
5,"Myth, Magic, and Metaphor","For me, this was a delightful and refreshing book to read. I found myself underlining and asterisking numerous phrases throughout the book to refer to again and again. I would highly recommend it to anyone involved in or interested in the creative arts."
