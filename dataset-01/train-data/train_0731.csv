2,Not too sturdy,"Had to return it. I bought it to put a projector on...but the legs didn't fit well, so it really wobbled. Unfortunate, because it was the type of thing I was looking for."
2,light and easy but not good,This product is light and easy to travel but the telescoping legs are not great. They make the table seem flimsy when fully extended.
5,Laptop Travel Powerhouse!,"This is an amazing laptop desk. I've used many laptop stands and tables, however I've never found one that does what this one does. The adjustable legs allow me not only to use my laptop on the road, but in bed as well. At the shortest setting the table becomes the perfect height for computing in bed. My laptop has found a life long mate. Kudos TableTote."
1,Horrible! Barely stands up!,"This is a horrible, unsturdy peice. Once assembled- it was so wobbly, I didn't even place a book on it! I thought I put it together wrong, but I didn't. I should've listened to the other reviews- but I thought ""how bad could it be- everyone else was being dramatic""... It's horrible- don't buy it!"
1,Poor Customer Service and Quality,"After reading all the good review about this product, I ordered it. Unfortunately it did not suite my needs and when I tried to set up, one of the leg got struck up. I wanted to return this product and whenever I called the customer service number provided in the Seller's web site, it always went to the message box. They never returned the call at all. I wasted my money and this product became useless. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product to any one. Poor quality and Poor customer service."
1,If I could give no star I would.,"Wow, this company actually has the nerve to charge 40 dollars + for a piece of junk. And to make matters worse, one of the cheap aluminum legs came slightly bent. Also, some plastic part that's supposed to be attached to the leg came right off, making it impossible to tighten. How do people get away with selling junk like this? And why is everyone giving this a great review, I really wonder how that's possible."
1,Not as expected,"Not worth $35. It cannot accommodate >14 inch laptops properly. If used for long time, you will have fingers, arms and neck pain. One of the legs was not standing on the ground properly."
3,Not very great.,"As others have said, this thing is terribly shaky. I use it to set a screen on and that's about it. If you where trying to type on it you can't look at the screen without getting a headache. I would buy something else."
3,Good product but a little light,"This is a good product, I used it indoors to hold my DMX Controller that controls my lights on my studio. I have a piece of foam behind my skiny box that matches the height so I can put my NETBOOK on top of it. It holds the weight on both, but I don't use it for heavy weights equipment so I give it 3 stars."
3,it doesn't look the same with Click for larger image and other views,"I bought Tabletote - Portable Compact Lightweight Laptop Notebook Stand because I saw in the ""Click for larger image and other views"", there is a chair...but when I received my order, the chair is not including."
2,Tabletote,"Very easy to use and very usefull. A little flimsey, but stable enough. Would buy again.Modified 15 Jun 10: The locking mechanism used to adjust the height of the legs won't tighten on two of the legs, making the table unusable. Baring this problem, the tote is/was nice."
5,impressive,"Ordered the Tabletote on the evening of April 1st and it was on my doorstep on April 6th...terrific service...and what a gem of a portable stand,easy to set-up or pack to take along as a spot to set-up your PC anywhere you are...totally pleased with the product and service"
2,Looks nice,"While you expect a portable table to be somewhat light weight, this item is flimsy to the point of almost not being usable. It sways madly even when typing with the lightest touch. I thought to use it for my Yamaha keyboard but it simply won't do the job. It would suffice only for setting something down that you won't be picking up or moving much. A projector comes to mind (as long as the AC isn't blowing on it)."
1,Do not Buy this table!,"This table is not secure at all, it's all made plastic and cheap constructed.I returned because there is no way I'll be putting my 2000 dollars Mac Bbook or my 1500 projector on it."
1,Absolute garbage,"I very rarely right negative reviews, but this ""table"" is worth of the posting. Reminded me of something you'd fine at the .99cent store. Horrible quality, wouldnt put a broken laptop on this thing let a lone a working one. Very wobbly, extended portion falls out, and a slight twist on the leg locks sheers off the plastic locking studs. A cardboard box would be more effective.My 11 yr old daughter wanted it to keep stuff on (instead of returning it), after 1 day even she said to get rid of it. I threw out the box when she said she wanted it, or i would have returned it. Can't believe Amazon would sell this?I ended up throwing it away."
4,Can Be Wobbly,"This unit folds up so small and flat, that I love it for taking to presentations. The only caution I have is that it can get wobbly if you extend the legs to full length and the weight is not centered on the table. The legs store on the underside of the table and allows for a very compact table for a projector."
4,okay? i guess,"This stand was great for the price but it is not sturdy at all , just tap the thing with your finger and it wobbles"
1,Plastic Junk,"Not worth it or sturdy enough to trust it with my laptop. Looked like a good idea, but one false move and it crumples to the ground. slippery top surface. waste of money."
4,Love my desk,"First off my product came two days early ! Putting it together i thought it didnt really work until i realized that i didn't pit it on correctly, it was still use. I use it for school and home purpose it is soo light i love it. Just make sure u turn it tight so it wont fall, and you will be fine ."
3,Good design but flimsy,"It's a clever piece of design, practical and lightweight. One of the leg sockets came off fairly soon but still perfectly usable.Fine on a carpeted surface but not very stable on hard floors.Wouldn't buy another."
2,You get what you pay for,Takes a while to setup and is very cheap and flimsy... don't expect to put it together in 10 seconds... not exactly ideal.
3,Great and Sturdy Design,"The table works as detailed. It is a bit cumbersome, especially if you come across a local Starbucks that happens to have an extra seat but no table area. It's quite impressive after setup but during the before and after assembly required, it's hard but to notice the few chuckles and laughs at your oblivious awareness to geek-ness! Great at the airport too btw, especially when you have to transfer in between flights and do not want to leave your designated gate for the next three hours or so!"
3,it's okay,"it's not the sturdiest, but you get what you pay for. i would definitely use it for a single laptop OR a projector but not two things at once. i'd also be careful not to try and bang it around. other than that, it does what it's supposed to. only used it a couple times so far. we'll have to see how it does in the long run."
1,"cheap, flimsey don't buy it",The black plastic is flimsey. The legs don't fit in securely. The table top isn't level. I could blow on it and knock it over. My lap is much more stable. A waste of money.
4,impressively small,"It folds up into the size of a 14"" notebook or so and unfolds into a table! I don't use this for a laptop stand but rather to hold up a video projector for our video business when we go out on locations like weddings. It's really convenient, easy to assmble and reasonably sturdy.However, it is very light so it can be knocked over very easily. Also, any knocks against it or drops could result in damage, again, cause of hte light weight and construction. For the price it's great though."
2,Flimsy.,"I'm scared to put my laptop on it, it wiggles so much. though the legs use twist lock, don't twist to tight, you'll ruin it."
4,A good value,"This table is a good value - a little rickety, but very inexpensive. One leg wouldn't tighten properly; the company sent me two replacement legs very quickly."
1,Rivers,"People PLEASE BELIEVE the customer reviews!!! The Tabletote is not worth it's weight if it was a feather; $34.99 is way over the top/OVER PRICED; $9.99 would be pricey, also. The table is an awesome idea, and that's it! Material is cheap plastic, the legs are feeble and doesn't lock in properly. I over road the customer views hoping for a better experience, take my word also, the table is very poor quality. I was very disappointed, it was a Christmas gift, to cheap to present. I had it back at UPS the same day."
3,It's OK,"Package arrived quickly and is as advertised. If you only want something that is easy to cart around and set up, then this is for you. But if you want it to e sturdy and can e used as a working desk then try something else. It is nice and would be great to take to different functions for a show and tell but definitely not something that could be used for actual work."
3,Where is Kelso in Kelso,"I bought this book for my father Kelso being is his favorite horse of all time. My Dad put everything else aside to read this book. When he finished he offered to loan it to me but told me it was not very well written.I has high hopes of sharing my father's love for Kelso and reliving the races my Dad saw first hand by reading this book. However, this book does little to recapture the glory of this horse who was a national hero and 5 time Horse of the year.This book is not so much the story of Kelso as a book of dry facts and passages about people (and horses) loosely related to Kelso. The races are discussed primarily in numbers. Short bio's of people who have little or nothing to do with the central theme fill out this short book. There is little of Kelso in Kelso.All that said, it is the only book on Kelso I have been able to discover and it did help my Dad relive some happy memories. It gets 3 stars on that merit alone."
2,Very 1986,"A lot of excellent research has been done since 1986 (when this book was published) that has illuminated our understanding of women in America. Sure, this book will give you a general idea of women's history. But it is full of generalities that are unexplained, unsophisticated, and sometimes just wrong. For an understanding of women's lot in America before the women's movement, I recommend Mary Beth Norton's ""Liberty's Daughters"", or Laura Ulrich's ""Good Wives."" In these books you will find a much more nuanced telling of women's history, and a history that is footnoted to boot -- so we know where the author is getting her information."
5,I learned a lot of things I didn't know.,I bought this book for a History class but I really enjoyed reading it. I learned a lot of fascinating things about women that are not included in the regular History books.
4,Cause who doesn't love Shakespeare?,"I ordered this for a class and am very glad the professor recommended this edition. The introductions are great and footnotes helpful. If you are an English major, it never hurts to havea good Shakespeare anthology."
3,"Too Heavy To Carry Around, But I Do Recommend","Definitions were helpfulRecommended if you need help analyzing essays for easy, quick definitionsHeavy, which I don't like, because I had to take it to class"
2,"Great content, terrible binding/cover","I love the content - excellent play text, fascinating introductory essays. However the book is heavy, unwieldy and slippery. Consequently, reading on anything other than a flat surface is a most unpleasant experience. Sadly, I'll be returing this item do to it being so user unfriendly."
4,Would Rather Buy Each Book Individually,"I had to buy this book for my Shakespeare class, obviously. But I would much rather buy each book individually, because highlighting the words in this book is not effective. The highlighting really shows through. The Folger Library Books are the way to go for Shakespeare plays."
1,Professor White is upset,"This isn't my review. I heard Professor David Allen White, Shakespeare professor extraordinaire at the U. S. Naval Academy, last night on the Hugh Hewitt radio show. He was furious upon receiving the latest edition of this book to find that all of the notes and introduction have been larded with post-modernist criticism and political correctness. He says he can't teach from this book any more. He cites such nonsense as claiming that Amelia is the true heroine of Othello; As You Like It is about homoeroticism; yadda yadda yadda.He said that if Shakespeare were handed this book, he'd burn it.This review may not get published, so I have tried to contact the good Professor to post his own."
5,THE BEST CD FOR THE GYM/CAR/HOME & WORK !!!,"WHEN YOU GO TO THE GYM TO HIT THE WEIGHTS.PUT ON THIS CD AND IT WILL GET YOU PUMPED UP.AND IN THE MOOD TO WORK OUT.IF YOU CAN'T LIFT TO THIS;THEN YOU CAN'T LIFT TO NOTHING!!!ALICE COOPER IS A LIVING LEGEND;AND ALL THE SONGS ARE CLASSICS!!!SO PUT THIS IN THE CD PLAYER AND TURN THE VOLUME ON MAX!!!{ROME,NEW YORK:HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999}"
2,GET BEST OF: MASCARA & MONSTERS INSTEAD,"THIS BARGAIN PRICED 10 TRACK ALICE COOPER HITS COLLECTION IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH OWNING DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE BIGGER AND BETTER ALICE COOPER HITS COLLECTIONS OUT THERE LIKE THE LIFE AND CRIMES OF ALICE COOPER AND BEST OF: MASCARA & MONSTERS. OF COURSE, THERE ARE NO BAD SONGS ON THIS CD. BUT, I FIND IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO JUST PUT 10 SONGS ONTO A CD AND CALL IT A HITS COLLECTION OF ALICE COOPER. IT'S JUST FAR TOO MUCH STUFF MISSING FROM THIS CD AND WHEN YOU GET DONE LISTENING TO THIS CD, YOU WILL DEFINITELY WANT MORE. SO, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY COST MORE THAN THIS CD, BUY THE BEST OF: MASCARA & MONSTERS INSTEAD. YOU'LL GET ALL THESE SONGS PLUS 12 MORE SONGS THAT YOU WON'T FIND ON THIS CD."
1,"bluhhh, another of 1000 greatest hit albums by Alice","Another damn greatest hits album that fails to satisfy. If you want A/C's greatest hits, buy all the albums."
3,In a nutshell,"This book was written for quick reference only. I was not impressed. It was written well, but boring. I did learn from, but I wish I would have tried something different."
5,Hildgard inspired the Medieval and The New Age,"I love Hildegard's art and mysticism, and this book collects many of her works in one so it's a great way of getting to feel her spirit and energy. From the 11th century and she still inspires a lot! Thanks Hildegard for setting women on a much higher stand, love Licia"
4,A good collection,This is a good overview of Hildegard's work. Hildegard was in fact NOT canonized after her death.
4,Check out Raven records first...,"As a long time fan (I go back to the start on the Lower East Side) I have upgraded my vinyl and cassette collection of Willy's recordings over the years. The best bet for the Atlantic material is to check out Australia's Raven records. Their product is fairly complete for the early stuff and they are a reliable vendor over the internet (speedy and in excellent condition for all that travel). ""Love and Emotion"" is a nice record that misses a lot of good stuff, so save your money and go to Raven. If you are looking for compilations, theirs contain all the great Atlantic material. If you want to sample, start with their first, Return to Magenta, and their best Le Chat Bleu (get the longer version). There is also a nice English release of the first records called Savoir Faire which is worth seeking out if you are so inclined."
4,"Where Is ""Just Give Me One More Reason""?????","Don't get me wrong, this is great stuff and includes some rarities - I think the best period of Willy's career. But who puts these things together???? Obviously they don't know what they are doing at all!! His best song from this period ""Just Give me One More Reason"" is nowhere to be found. What a joke! They made a mess of this one when it was almost impossible to do!! Get the double CD ""Coup de Grace / Where Angels Fear to Tread"" instead."
5,An exciting Latin performer,"""No Me Compares"" is another excellent CD from young salsa prince Frankie Negron. Frankie has a powerful, expressive voice, and he brings great energy to the Spanish-language material. Some highlights of the album:""No te vayas"": Begins with a dramatic a capella prologue. ""Angel"": A Spanish language, salsa version of a song that was also recorded in English by Jon Secada. ""No quedan lagrimas"": A slower, gentler song; a good complement to the aggressive salsa style that characterizes many of the other songs. ""Princesa"": A wonderful romantic song that combines salsa style with musical elements that remind me of a 50s ""doo wop"" song. ""No se que haria sin ti"": In my opinion, the best song. Frankie tears into the material with joyful enthusiasm. This song also has wonderfully romantic lyrics.Overall, an excellent CD. Frankie Negron is one of the best voices in contemporary Latin music."
3,Pretty Good,"I just bought the cd yesterday and think it's pretty good. Maybe I'll have to listen to it a couple of more times before immediately falling in love with it, but it hasn't really grown on me like other cd's have instantly. The only 3 songs I like are Princesa, Agua Pasada, and Que tengo que hacer. Frankie's cute and very talented, but he's no where near the ""Emperor of Salsa"", which of course is my favorite artist of all time: THE ONE AND ONLY MARC ANTHONY!!!"
4,No Sophmore Jinx Here,It is a more agressive sounding album than the first one. It would be even better without the last song.
4,Great hiking book for the Tahoe Basin; very detailed,"My wife and I are avid hikers and had recently moved near Lake Tahoe and wanted to learn the trail system. This book goes into great detail regarding hike length, terrain, elevation, lakes, fishing and trailhead details. I also like the fact that it tells you which hikes are probably likely to be crowded and those less used."
2,Preachy Book With Pricey Recipes,"I love to make soap for my family and to sell. I find ""The Natural Soap Book"" to be a great disappointment. The recipes produce huge batches, so you'd better be an expert because after buying the expensive ingredients needed, if you are just learning or mess up you've got a very pricey addition to add to your trash. I didn't appreciate the preachy tone of this book either. I know it is important to broaden the horizons of the reader but Cavitches style was off-putting rather than transforming. The useful parts of the book are the explanations of ingredients sans the opinions and 1 or 2 recipes. Best to check this out of the library unless you enjoy burning your money."
3,Good resource for new soapmakers.,"I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning to make soap. After reading the book, I was hesitant with attempting to make soap since the author made it sound so complicated. (It took reading several other soapmaking books to get up the courage.) I use it more as a guide/advice book rather than a book for soapmaking recipes.I have to say, though, that this book was written by someone who has had a lot of experience with soapmaking, and it is one of the few books I read that had a ""troubleshooting"" guide for soapmaking problems. My first attempt with soapmaking was a failure. The first batch came out powdery in some areas. The troubleshooting guide helped explained why."
4,As Useful as it Can Be,One of the most useful books I had ever bought. This book explains step by step. I really appreciate taht is printed on Recycled paper.Thanks for recommending this book!
3,Has good info but....,This book and the other I purchased in the series (The soapmakers companion) have good information but the author is really out of the loop when it comes to the internet age and finding information on line. Also the recipes she gives are for gigantic batches of soaps. For the beginning soapmakers they are dang near ridiculous in size for batches. I found the book Smart Soapmaking by Anne L. Watson much more geared towards beginning and intermediate soapmakers with much better information including wonderful resources for lye calculators and recipe calculators that you can set the superfat discounts and water % as well. Was much more resourceful to me than these books by cavitch.
3,GOOD AND NOT GOOD,I'm starting a small business and I needed a book to help me with making a lot of soap in one time. The recipes usually make about 30-40 bars in one shot. If you're buying this for personal use I'D PASS. On the other hand if you're looking to sell soap go for it. Now the problem is there are NO pictures showing the final product! I like to see what i'm making and I'd like to see if mine looks the same when I'm done. They basically have little drawings if that's what you want to call them..not to helpful it that area. It's an O.K. book....it gives you the list of things you need to make soap and that's what I basically bought it for...
4,I loved this book,She tells you so much information in an easy to understand style. I also like the fact that she includes bulk suppliers and their contact info. The only thing I didn't care about is that the ingredients have to be weighed to use her recipies instead of just measuring them. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in making soap. If you want to make natural soap this book can stand on it's own.
3,Slightly Outdated,"While this book had a lot of information in it, I found that the author gave too much information on one subject,and not enough about the other. For instance, she mentions herbs that people can use for colorants, but refuses to even give an idea about what colors they yield or how much one should use. Additionally, some of her advice is outdated because the internet wasn't as huge as when she wrote the book as it is today- so her advice about where to buy materials and products isn't very helpful. However, if you want to ""geek out"" on soap and really want to know nearly everything, this a great book."
3,I thought maybe he was crazy,"Overall, I liked the dialogue and historical setting. I haven't read much about the Whites and the Reds beyond the 1917 Revolution. Nice change of pace. The part I thought lacking was the main star's lack of on screen fieldwork. He sure got around, but you hear of it more than experience it. I was thinking it was possible he was living a fantasy life, but then you'd see him with actual Generals and peers and they did know him. You have to read the English subtitles."
2,Deceptive description,"The description about these invitations/thank you notes says ""16 count"" when there are only 8 of each. I ordered these for my daughter's birthday party expecting 16 invitations. By the time they arrived it was too late to order another pack so we were stuck going to the party supply store and buying other invitations."
4,"Sinsemilla, known, yet still underrated.","Greetings all Black Uhuru fans,I and I have been a fan of the Uhuru ever since, and am a fan of the one and only Michael Rose.It's unfortunate that the site doesn't have a sample of my favorite song from this here album, ""Vampire.""It's that song that pins the whole album down, the foundation, it's a great closer to the album.Michael Rose sounds battered but not beaten on the tracks, much like the phoenix rising from the ashes, he still has much fight in him, the most perfectly dramatic song I've heard in my life.You can feel his sense of anticipation and struggle. Great album from beginning to end, no filler here.But this album is only the start, all their albums with the trio of Duckie, Puma and Michael are worthy of being in any reggae collection.one love."
1,lighter weights too stiff for spinners,"I purchased two packs of Hi-Seas Grand slam several months ago. 8 and 17lb mono. I spooled a Shimano sedona 2500 with the 8lb. Went on nice but seemed a little thick. Took it out fishing for trout. When casting light lures the hi-seas line wouldn't spin off the reel easily. After several casts I looked at the reel to see if I had any problems and found nothing. I continued casting 1/8th,1/4th and 1/2 ounce jigs. casts were all very short and again it came off the reel like a 20lb. Seems this line will only work with heavier weights like are used in bait casting. The 17lb may work out but the 8lb doesn't with small spinners. Never again!"
1,Delaminating Fishing Line,I put this stuff on two of my conventional reels and did a fishing trip last week. This line delaminated when it rubbed against anything. I had a fish on the hook that went under the boat and where the line came in contact with the boat the line had shavings attached to it. When I pulled on the shavings they eventually peeled off the line. Usually in this situation I can feel a rough surface where the line rubs against something but I have never seen this delamination/peeling. I may have just received a bad batch but I won't be using any of it to fish with. I have not contacted the seller yet.
5,Great!,"I received my fishing line fast & well packaged. It was a bigger spool than I could buy at any local retail store, I am well pleased and I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for good quality fishing line!"
2,Not So Good,"I WAS using 10 lb test on spin cast and underspin reels and the line is too stiff for those type reels, it MAY be ok for bait casting reels but I am so displeased with it, I didn't even try. The spool went to trash can."
2,Not Furaha,"I spent time teaching in Kenya and enjoyed the sites of the major cites such as Nairobi and Kisumu. Yet, when I read this book, where the setting is in Kenya, I did get the feeling of the East African country. For example, most family do not hop into a car-they are too expensive- and go on a picnic. Also, when you do ride down the road in a matatu, you will not see giraffes lined along the street. Furthermore, the author had the family traveling to the lake. I had no problem with a family enjoying time together because families do that in Kenya. However, anybody who ever been to East Africa knows that most famous lake in Kenya in Lake Victoria(Ukerewe), a source of the white Nile river. It seems to me that author made up a story about a family go on an outing and added some sprinkles of Kiswhalili worlds."
4,Assault on conventions,"Those of you who know Greg Bear need not read my accolades to appreciate his contributions to the field. Those of you who have not are in for many treats through his works. When a story continues to place the reader in the question of ""what would I do in this situation?"" I believe it has accomplished its goal. Think of Ender here. Ask youself about how you feel about differences between people and cultures and ethnicity and responsibility and you start to see where this story will take you. Imagine the sense of xenophobia you would experience should you encounter life from far off worlds. Would you be xenophobic? This story by Bear is a significant contribution not as much to science fiction as it is to people understanding each other on this planet."
2,Decent X-Rated Sci-Fi...,"Personally, I found this book, overall, to be decent. This is mainly due to the theme of Earth's survivors getting revenge on the planet-killers, which I found quite interesting. However, the main story is not what struck me as memorable. Rather, Bear's ultra-graphic descriptions of sexual situations between the ""children"" is what I remember best. For a sci-fi novel, this is a shame. In fact, many of the sex scenes could be labeled X-rated. Obviously, I can't be explicit, but he describes EVERYTHING. Imagine an XXX film put into words and that's what you have.I realize that these situations are natural, but so is defication, and I don't need a description of that in detail (maybe in a Romance novel, but not hard sci-fi)!As a result, Bear's main story often got lost for a few pages while the ""children"" were pleasuring themselves.Maybe I'm too used to the Asimov/AC Clarke style of writing, but I just couldn't get into this book, mainly due to the excessive sex scenes."
4,Anvil of Stars a worthy sequel to The Forge of God,"Anvil of Stars is a worthy sequel to Greg Bear's outstanding The Forge of God. Rich in detail, plot, and character, Anvil doesn't disappoint, especially in the last fifty pages.Martin Gordon's task is not an envious one...Carrying out The Law, hunting down the Killers, self-replicating machines that destroyed Earth in Forge, across the vast expanse of our universe. Along the way, politics, sex, and duty shape his outlook on justice.This book checks in at a respectable 471 pages, and you get your money's worth out of each page...One of the deepest books I've read in a long time!"
3,"Can a book be disappointing and yet, satisfying?","That's how I feel about this incredibly ambitious mess of a novel. As a writer, Greg Bear really swings for the fences, which sometimes works brilliantly. Sometimes, however, it fails. ""Forge of God"" delivered, ""Anvil of Stars"" does not. Yet, why did I keep reading? It's Bear's incredible imagination that keeps you going. There are really wonderful things in this book that will blow your mind (the Brothers, anti matter). Just don't expect a great story like ""Forge."""
3,better than The Forge of God,"Compared to some of his other books, the end of this one was a little more satisfying -- in the sense that I was left with some interesting things to think about but there was also a definite conclusion.I enjoyed the characters, especially the alien ""Brothers"" -- they were interesting, and not the all-powerful, all-wise stereotype we find in a lot of sci-fi.There was a bit too much sex described for my tastes but oh well."
2,"Good technological/astronomical fiction, annoying characters","First off let me say that the science part of the science fiction was very interesting. The idea of ""fake matter"", the way that entire star systems were engineered... captivating. The alien races & other technologies were likewise very fun to read about. However...The human interactions, and plot lines concerning the relationships of a few dozen adolescents packed into a confined space... were no more captivating to me than any other novel written in any other genre would be. I could not develop any attachment to any of the characters, and I found the dialogue tedious and the ""fleshing out"" of characters lacking.Finally: the person who said it could be a ""Rated XXX"" novel... What version were YOU reading?? I've seen steamier english in Redbook magazine.Pancake!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Never-never land = space.The few people that survived the destruction of Earth are now travelling by spaceship.Not sure that political organisation via Peter Pan is really that great an idea, however that is what they do.Infighting problems to be overcome before they can think about alien destroyer slaying, though.Just another decent read.3.5 out of 5"
2,Space Children with God-like power,"I read this book hoping for some closure from the dissatisfying Forge of God. No such luck. I did finish it, even though, as other reviewers have mentioned, the characters were not very sympathetic. Basically a buch of immature kids in a kind of space anarcho-syndiclast commune (ha!) are given weapons of unbelieveable power and fly around destroying star systems, in search of the ""killers"" that destroyed earth. Oh yeah, there's also a lot of free ..., inconsequential subplots and some attempt at designing a new religion. However, it was reasonably well written, although about twice as long as it should have been, and there's some interesting science, so two stars."
3,"Starts dull, ends good","""The Forge of God"" was a 5 star book and this was a bit of a let down compared to that. In particular, the first hundred pages or so are dull and somewhat silly. I don't mind the slow build-up so much as all the discussion on bisexuality and ""slicking"" between the ""Wendy""s and the ""Lost Boys""s? I suppose they are liberated from the dead planet Earth and its morals, but I signed up to read a ""hard sci-fi"" book and not a space harlequin. Likewise, the regular ""momerath"" discussions are unnecessary and dull too. Anyways, after the first battle these two topics drop to the background and the rest of the book is good."
1,A Bloated Toad,"The first book ""The Forge of God"" was an excellent novel and fun to read. This one is not. It is easily twice as long as it should be if not more. The story suffers from the idea that more pages makes for a better novel and soon becomes monotonous."
2,This is a failed sequel,"Unlike the Forge of God which really kept me on the edge of my seat, and had me caught up in the emotions of the horrifying ending, this left me cold. I could not relate to the characters at all and the plot was disconected at best."
3,Nice musical piece,"More commercial than some of his early music but still quality musicianship on this disc, some good cover tunes are here to listen."
1,"This is not a book, this is a course binder","I have attended Chet's course's before on other subjects and found them to be very helpful. So when I need a book on PowerBuilder and saw his name, I was thrilled. The only problem with this book is that it is not a book...It's a course binder. I think for[dollar amount] I should have received a true book. ...My comments are in no way a reflection of Chet's work, I think he does a great job of instructing, and informing. I beleive that the Publisher's were the ones that are [charging too much]."
1,Do not Believe What You See,"I purchased this item because it showed the complete mounting set which includes if you look at the picture -- the bolts, washers, retainers as well as the cab mounts. When I received the order the only thing included in the order was the cab mounts --no bolts, washers or retainers. I talked to a representative from Amazon and he also thought that they should be included and reordered the item for me and we again received only the cab mounts. I cancelled the order and reordered the item from another company. How disappointing. So if you just want the cab mounts this item is fine. The listing should be corrected immediately."
1,Gross,This pillow makes me made. It is heinous. If i saw this pillow in someones house i would try to flush it down the toilet.
3,"Not versatile, but solid","There is no question the Palm Treo hard case will protect your Treo if it were to fall to the ground WHILE IT IS IN THE CASE. It is quite sturdy. I have never had a problem with the belt clip or the case falling off of my belt. If accidentally hit in the ""right"" place, however, the case will swing open and your phone will fall out and hit the ground. It is also not possible to use your hard case while also using a wired hands-free attachment or music headphones. There is also no option to attach it to anything else other than a belt. Your phone will not fit in the hard case while using a ""skin."" And it can be a little bulky in your pocket. Nevertheless it still a sleek-looking option for protecting your investment in your Treo."
3,Not what I expected,"I needed a case to carry my Treo 650 in my purse and thought this would be the answer. Although it holds my Treo well, I have a couple of complaints.The 'removable' belt clip is not removable. Short of breaking the top of my case I can't figure out how to get it off. (The instructions were useless) I don't need a belt clip in my purse and bought this case because the clip was removable. It now catches on things in my bag and is a reall hassle.Also, the feel is a bit cheap. (Remember 'polycarbonate' is just a fancy word for plastic) This case has the feel of a kid's toy.So I'm disappointed and feel a bit cheated that I got something this jinky for almost $30."
3,"Good protection, could have more features and better clasp","I've used this as a belt case for almost a year. It protects well, but I wish the clasp was a little more secure when the case drops. The phone sometimes comes out after a fall, but the case takes the brunt of the impact. I wish that the case had a hole for the headphone jack, but I haven't gotten around to drilling a hole. The hinges are holding up well even though the open side of the case gets caught on things if I leave it open on my belt while talking on the phone. Would buy this case again and recommend it to a friend."
3,Not as good as it looks,Phone is hard to get out of the case and depending on the belt it slips off. For the price it is ok but not great.
4,I like this case!,"I bought this case to replace an old leather case that had worn out and never did provide much protection for the phone. I read the reviews on-line here and was a little skeptical, because of comments about the case not latching shut securely and not being able to wear the case on your left side.I have found that the problem with the latch is true - you really have to be careful to make sure the case latches shut when you close it. Several times it has come open after I've closed it. Now I find myself checking it each time i close it to make sure the phone does not fall out.As for being able to wear it on my left side, it does work OK. It's just a little awkward in getting the phone out of the case.Overall, I am very satisfied. The hard polycarbonate case seems to provide much more protection than the soft leather case I previously had."
3,"okay, but not perfect","I was having problems ""phantom dialing"" with my leather case and this hard case certainly solves that problem. It's a little tricky to get used to opening it and removing the phone, but not that bad. What I don't like about it is that I prefer to wear my phone on my left side so it doesn't get hooked in the seat belt latch in the car, and that makes the antenna face toward the rear. This makes it a bit harder to remove and replace without dropping the phone. I'm not sure how they could change the design to make it work on either side, but it would certainly work better for me if it did."
1,disappointed with the clip on the hard case,"The major problem is that the case has a clip that slips over the belt. The case is always, always slipping off the belt whenever you move! Then you stand up and the case falls from your lap onto the floor. I stopped using the case after it dropped to the floor and my Treo flew across the room. It happened too many times. Why doesn't the case have a belt loop so that the case stays securely on the belt? Why use a metallic clip that always slips loose? Also, as noted in other reviews, the case opens to less than 90 degrees which causes difficulties when the phone is ringing and you want to grab it quickly. The case can only be worn on your right side and opened conveniently with your right hand. The Treo can be easily scraped on the metallic closure fixture unless you're careful. This wasn't my first case for the Treo but it's the biggest disappointment. I'm still looking for a suitable case."
3,It brakes easily,It's a nice costume but I got it for my seven year old and it got ripped apart between the legs the first time she used it..very delicate not for a child that is active specially in halloween!
3,"The Vinyl Lasts, but...","The vinyl on this cover is durable enough but the cord that keeps it attached to the umbrella when it's covered deteriorates way too quickly. We keep our umbrella covered when it's not in use during the summer and I store it in the garage during the winter. So at most the cover is exposed to weather 6 months out of the year. This is our second Dayva umbrella cover and with both covers, the cord disintegrated within 6 mos."
2,"Missing ""high-reach rod""","The umbrella cover was fine, however I purchased this cover specifically because it was supposed to come with a ""high-reach rod"" to help take the cover on and off the top of a hard to reach umbrella. No rod was included in the package and was also not included in the replacement. I am currently using a bent coat hanger that I am sure is not working as well."
4,Much Better Than The Old Vinyl,Nice item. Its seems much more durable then a previous one I had purchased. I got about 2 years out of the old vinyl one before it became brittle and cracked in hundreds of places. This feels more supple. I am pleased.
3,No precut hole for steel support rod,My only disappointments were that I had to create an opening for the steel support rod to slip in and the draw string system at bottom does not work well.
5,extremely helpful,"My wife and I have used Carter's ""Helping Yourself With Foot Reflexology"" book with highly satisfied results. We often give each other foot massages as described in the book and have found healing from many common illnesses such as headaches, backaches, stress, etc. We highly recommend use of foot reflexology to all and have also suggested its use to many friends who have also shared its helpfulness."
1,Plain Recordings Pressing Quality?,"I am a big fan of almost all of Elliott Smith's work. He devoted great care and attention to his sounds and recording equipment. In fact, his releases sounded fabulous on CD, so I could not wait to hear the same music on vinyl.Unfortunately, both of the Plain Recordings Elliott Smith LPs I've purchased sound muffled and distorted. Something is lost in the translation here ... I've been ripped off!! While Elliott Smith's music deserves 5 stars, the piece of vinyl I received from Plain Recordings is unlistenable. If you want to hear Elliott Smith, an old CD is the best option.Hopefully someone will obtain the rights to the original masters and will release some Elliott Smith vinyl that is worthy of the music and original recording quality. Until then, buyer beware."
3,In a perfect world this would be average,"3 1/2It is a testament to this man's indie-pop songwriting finesse, that perhaps his least popular major studio offering, which has been criticized of inconsistencies, remains a pretty solidly engaging disc. It's ok not to call the influential arranger super-unique; Smith's gifts were for taking what had influenced him so profoundly and molding it in clever and exciting new ways. Few would be able to make derivative sound so fresh and inspired."
4,Not his best but still supersweet,This is Elliot Smith's worst album but it is still better than ant of the dribble that is out today.Son Of Sam has all the workings of a classic.This album as a must for fans of good music.
5,simply amazing,"If you are an Elliott Smith whatsoever there should be no reason why you woudln't pick this CD up. But if you're not, there isn't one thing about the CD that I could tell you makes it so great. It's simply put an amazing CD that will force you to feel what he is talking about and come out of it a different person. Elliott Smith is an amazing artist- simply put."
3,Maybe it'll get better,"I approached this album as I would an album by a new artist. I forgot all about the previous recordings and just focused on this one. This cd is so close to a 4 it hurts but I have to rate it fairly. I think this cd has some genuinely great songs on it(Easy Way Out, LA, Son of Sam, and Wouldn't Mama Be Proud are all outstanding in their own way), but there are songs that I think pull down the album (Somebody That I Used To Know, Everything Means Nothing To Me, Pretty Mary K, and Stupidity Tries are all forgetable). All the other songs just fall into the middle. This is worth buying and I don't regret it. I believe it'll grow on me come a few more months."
2,"Elliott, no!","I'm with my brother on this one, 'Figure 8' is terrible. Elliott - what happened?!? I realize that since signing on to Dreamworks, Smith has been able to make music at a production level he's for some time dreamed of playing with, and that his pop sensibilities have now been allowed to take flight. But with this new direction we lose the intimacy and also the edge that we've come to know with the first 3 LPs. That may sound like kind of a lame complaint, but in addition to that, I find the songwriting on this album downright atrocious. Think hard before you buy this. I'm an Elliott Smith fan, but 'Figure 8' is not good."
2,Get over it,"Elliot has become a progressively better producer over the last decade but ""Figure 8"" proves that it has been at the expense of his songwriting skills. There is not one, Not One, track on here that ranks with his classics or even the average song from ""XO"". This is a dreary, bitter album that disgusts me as a former admirer of E. Smith; too many tracks seem to be jealous, snide attacks on other musicians who have sold out. I fail to see what other people see in this record. It just proves to me that today's college radio has become a glut of Good Old Boys who rule by the strength of past successes, current failures be damned!"
2,"Not even one song could make it onto ""XO""","Elliott's previous effort, ""XO"", is far superior and possibly my all-time favorite CD. I can't describe my anticipation for ""Figure 8"" or my disappointment in the results, even after several listens. I really hope he gets back to the ""XO"" or ""Either/Or"" sound, preferably the former."
3,Some great songs but ....,"There's some great songs on here--Somebody That I Used To Know, Everything Reminds Me of Her, Easy Way Out, Wouldn't Mama Be Proud.I loved all of XO, but finally on this album some of his music sounds over-indulgent to my ears--i.e, Junk Bond Trader, Everything Means Nothing to Me, In The Lost and Found, Happiness, Pretty Mary K, the end of Can't Make A Sound. I think this is his least listenable album, mostly due to all the mega-production and the occasionally too-sophisticated chord patterns. Personally, I can't take 3 or 4 vocal tracks of Elliott's voice simultaneously on more than a couple of these songs. I think on this album his technical showmanship is a lot stronger than his songwriting, and I don't really care about technical showmanship.In any case, all this makes me appreciate the unmatched touching quality of his previous albums."
4,Good Stuff!!!,"This is a terrific album. Buy it! If you're reading these reviews you obviously have some interest in this kind of music!Elliot and the Like! (Matthew Jay, Travis etc..) have come out of the shadows and in their quiet way are fast becoming a refreshing force in the music world... and to a degree being left alone to do their thing.Elliot's songs take me back to early Simon & Garfunkel, a little Brian Wilson, and undoubtedly Paul McCartney without a deliberate stealing! His writing reflects a similar poetic colloquialism that was very much in Paul Simon's early work! It's a welcome return!This collection of songs also show Elliot growing up without losing his root which made us all take notice in the first place!"
4,an amazing album!!!!,"this album is my first from elliot smith cd's series and i think that elliot smith is a great singer and writer. Figur 8 is a great cd and a fantastic opening with ""SAN OF SAM"".if you like a pop\rock music this cd is for you.I hope this review help you!!."
4,A Must Listen!,"I find it tragic that in the days of mindless pop like Backless Boys and Brainless Spears we are slamming Elliot Smith for what, selling 100,000 CDs versus 10,000. This is music the masses should be hearing. Great pop music. I personally think the production is great; with more layering on some tracks and just Elliot and his guitar on others. It never gets in the way of the as always excellent songwriting. Man, this guy throws more hooks in a two and a half minute song than should be legal. A lesser artist could probably just milk the hooks in ""Everything Reminds Me of Her"" alone into a double CD. That song is a masterpiece ans well worth the price of the CD alone. So let's not knock Mr. Smith for not putting the same CD out five times in a row. Let him grow artistically and hopefully his audience will too."
5,Brilliant,"I just discovered Elliott Smith today. All I heard was snippets of each of his songs, which I quickly became hooked on within two or three seconds. Perhaps it's because his musical style is so similar to my favorite band Sixpence None the Richer. Even his voice is wispy and...ethereal, as Leigh Nash has been described. If you love Sixpence and also Jars of Clay, you'll love Elliott Smith's Figure 8."
3,Nothing much to speak of,"What most people will find here, is a collection of marginally depression, hookless indy pop. After a time, the songs largely start to run together and sound the same. Not a bad album by any means, but certainly not worthy of the praise it receives in this listener's opinion.Trust me, you can skip this one."
1,A Jackson Browne for the New Milennium,"That ain't a compliment. Yeah, he's sensitive, yeah, he's been dumped on. So what, haven't we all been? Expanding his vision beyond his navel might help, but I dunno."
1,Boring and Uninspired,Elliott Smith sings the same whiny note in every song throughout this album. Distinguishing one song from the other is difficult. Don't believe the hype; there is nothing remarkable about this album or Smith's singing talents.
4,"Great Album, not his best","I love Elliot Smith but I think Figure 8 isn't as good as ""XO"" or his final album: ""From a basement on a hill"" moody, emotional and deep lyrical these other albums are better in my opinion than this dream works produced theatrical hyped up production. When listening to a guy like elliot it's better not to be overly produced and have to deal with all the big noise coming from all these orchestral induced hollywoodish big band sounds that drown out something that should be kept simple and plane."

5,The Ibiza Dance hit of 1999...INSTANT CLASSIS,Everybody who was present in Ibiza in 1998 knows this song. Ibiza as dance capitol of the world made this song THE dance hit of 1998 all over Europe. This is made into a instant classis with artist like: Felix and Moby
3,This Original Version versus new updated Version by Colton Ford,"I enjoy the song. Apparently, I am spoiled by the Colton Ford versions of this song since it is faster and more dance-like version of the Stardust song. Even though I was around when the original came out, I never heard since I was working two jobs and did not have much time for the radio or dance clubs since I was working like 7 days a week. You can check out Colton's version on Amazon also. It us on his Under the Covers Album, which is a how do you say a cover songs albums since all the songs were done by someone else and he put his spin and updated flavor on it. You may hate me for killing people's thinking of the original version, but we all have our likes and dislikes in music. Enjoy both songs but like the one over the other. Perhaps I can listen to the original more and perhaps come to love it also."
1,Horrid,This is not real music! Absolute trash. It took the producers 10 mins to make the song and they are laughing all the way to the bank. Learn what real dance music is about people!
5,Die Strippers! Die!! Die!!!...,"When Herschel Gordon Lewis bid farewell to movie-making, his swan song was the wonder-of-cinema, THE GORE GORE GIRLS. As it stands, I consider this to be his magnum opus of gooshy cheeeze. TGGG is even better than 2000 MANIACS! It's Lewis' tribute to / parody of the giallo film, complete w/ black-gloved killer and surprise-identity revelation. The murders are insanely bloody, the strippers are a hoot, and the story is absolutely absurd! Sheer perfection..."
1,Waste of Time,"This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. The concept, so I thought was a wonderful idea combining my love of gore, and strippers. But the dissappointment starts from the 1st scene and doesn't end until probably months after the credits have finished. I received this DVD as a gift(at my request) thinking what a great idea! For a movie to be produced, a large number of people have to think that it is a good idea. I truly hope that the group who thought that the Gore Gore Girls was a good idea are banned from using a movie camera for life."
2,It could have been so much worse!,"Yes this movie was awful in every way. Bad acting by actors who were drunk or just some yahoo pulled off the street to say a line or two. Bad editing and no continuity what so ever. The effect could have been done by Mrs.Brown's third grade class from household items from around the kitchen. The movie may have been bad, so bad in fact it's fun to watch! Better than Ghost Dog that's for sure! This is just the perfect movie to sit around with a bunch of friends and have a good laugh. then pick up your camcorder and make your own better movie. This movie isn't a horror movie...unless you think about the clothing, but more of a comedy spoof. Want a big laugh. Watch the commentary the director thinks he's a genius. Now that's a hoot!"
2,Boring,"This isn't even a good sleaze movie. Some one with black glovesis chopping up strippers in the cheesiest ways possib le. The goreeffects are really bad in this movie, this is about as realistic as spraying red Kool Aid everywhere. Pathetic gore effects, really horrible acting (that was expected), and really stupid jokes but the ending where the woman falls out of the window and her head gets ran over by a car is hilarious. You can tell its a watermelon.I can't believe this made it to DVD, its not even worth renting. Go get some real gore, see some Peter Jackson or Lucio Fulci movies."
2,One of the better HGL films,"Gore-hounds take note, ""The Gore Gore Girls"" is perhaps the most gruesome film made by Herschell Gordon Lewis. Of course, the viewer gets to witness some rather trashy strip sequences that contain more scares than the movie itself! Everything else is pretty standard: gross effects, bad acting (though there are a few surprises here, such as a guest appearance by ""The King Of the One-Liners"" Henny Youngman), and some absolutely awful directing! For the most part, I felt that this film was a meager step up from earlier Lewis films like ""The Gruesome Twosome"", and the jokes actually seemed more intentional this time!The DVD is a well-done project, featuring a wonderfully candid HGL interview/commentary that tells you everything you wanted to know, or didn't want to know, about ""The Gore Gore Girls"". The other extras, especially the Goddess Of Gore segment, are also interesting for early-gore film fanatics."
3,Worth renting- if only once,"This was a decent midnight movie- my friends and I definately got a kick out of it. 2 am, crammed in a small college dorm, and completely blazed is the way to watch a film like this. H.G. Lewis, ""The Godfather of Gore,"" certainly knows how to cram together as much graphic violence and gore as he possibly can during the murder scenes. The detective, although irritating at times (okay- many times), can be entertaining to pay attention to. The real gems, of course, are the cheesy strip shows. This movie must have been shot in super 8, because often all the white comes in as bright lime green (I love his car in that shade). Overall, ""Gore-Gore Girls"" is worth a rent sometime. Anyway, we watched this as a companion to Dario Argento's ""Suspiria""- which is without a doubt the supirior film. Reguardless, it was an interesting double-feature...everyone's got to have a midnight movie marathon once and awhile."
4,Funny,I remember seeing this as a kid and still find it entertaining! Classic Spaghetti Western. Must have for a dvd collector.
3,product okay,product was is not set up so good for surround sound but other then that was a great purchase. I just love these movies
4,Remastered!,"It's great to see Terence Hill and Bud Spencer in their famous classics completely re-mastered and with bonus features.Unfortuantly some footage is edited,but I still loved this pack.Both films are in English and are full of what you expect from Terence Hill and Bud Spencer!"
5,Terrific buy,I bought this for my husband and he couldn't stop watching it til he was finished with it. he loves it and has enjoyed every minute of it.
3,Terence Hill Classics,"Got the VHS tapes and had to have the DVD's. Just wish the video quality was higher. I compare DVD's to my others and sometimes there's a difference that's not as good. Still, I'm happy I was able to get them."
3,Trinity Twin Pack,"I am a huge ""Trinity"" fan. I was disappointed that the first of the 2 movies was very poor production quality. Extremely grainy. The second was pretty good quality. My rating would have been higher if the reproduction was better."
4,These versions look fantastic....But are they edited versions?,These two versions look great as far as picture quality goes. But the running times don't seem to match the original running time. Perhaps we can get an amateur dvd detective on the case? They also seem to be from French(the word avec is in the opening credits) source material so they might be shorter prints than the original. But other than that the quality is excellent. The movies are alot of fun and highly recommended. I just hate dvds that are not in original running time though so that is why Iam concerned a little. The box art states that they are from original negatives and they do look the best I have ever seen. But are they edited is the question?
4,Absurdly funny,"I never watched Westerns as a kid, so my recent introduction to the Trinity movies was a real treat. These movies aren't of the best quality (production-wise), but I understand from other reviews that this particular version is far superior to any others out there. But the stories are hilarious, and everyone in my family loved them - from my 60-ish dad on down to my 8-year-old little sister. Trinity's laziness is legendary, his filth is unparalleled, and these movies can't really be compared to anything other than Blazing Saddles. The humor here is a little less ribald, but still funny enough that you'll want to watch them over and over."
4,The right hand usually knows what the left hand is doing,A healthy plate full of spaghetti for the discriminating fan of Westerns. Lots of funny moments in both of these movies--from slapstick to card-sharking and trick-shooting..If you're a fan of this genre this is good stuff..
5,Great product,"I bought this as a gift. The delivery was quicker than expected reducing my stress level greatly! The gift was well received, so I'm thinking getting this is a good idea for anyone who's looking for it..."
5,My naMe is _I LOVE IT_,HA HA HA How thay know?_We are the brothers. This is THE BEST -EVER_ .. Bud and Terence pocebly could make.The best movie in this set. Thera nothing better on the market than this. I menth in the western comedy. !!!
4,Trinity Twin Pack,Good light hearted westerns. The actors are great.Arrived in good shape and in a timely manner
5,Finally!!!!!,"I have been waiting for these movies to come out with good quality picture & sound for a long time. That time is now. I couldn't be happier than I was when I opened these movies and watched them. Now I can wait for Flim Flam Man with George C. Scott, The Rounders with Henry Fonda & Glen Ford, and Jekyll & Hyde Together Again with Mark Blankfield to come out. As they are all great movies also. If anyone knows who to contact to get these movies made into DVD format please share it with me, because they are also long over due to come out."
5,Full score for 'Concepting',"Rijkenberg's theory of 'Concepting' is a cutting-edge approach, which reveals a deep understanding of today's cynical consumer who can no longer be defined by traditional marketing methods. It is indeed a comprehensive and inspiring piece and should be considered as an important tool for marketers of the 21st century."
5,Easy and successful,"This is by far the best marketing book I have ever read; Rijkenberg's view is not just very interesting it is successful too, I apply the concepting theory in almost every project at work. Easy to read and with good and practical examples you don't need to be an expert to apply his ideas, I even use it as a ""must"" in College classes for all my students."
4,The logical progression,"This book examines the end of traditional marketing (the 4Ps) and offers proven new strategies for business growth ('marketing the other way around'). The arguments are infallible for developed markets, and they are based on an insightful understanding of human behaviour, particularly into the manufacturing side of the value chain. It is written with passion and in an accessible and extremely commonsense manner. Read this one and put it into practice."
5,Awesome.,"Great to see behind the scenes and early days live performances. The commentary is great, but limited. Comes with Death Comes to Town! Deal! It's worth the money. If it ever comes to Blu Ray (Maybe with more commentaries?) It'll be worth it then, too!"
5,Exactly what I ordered,This item was exactly what I ordered and was delivered quickly. I am very pleased with both the product and the service. THANKS.
1,"Not enough tension to grab anything; plus, they broke!","These are advertised as toast tongs, but I bought them in a store where they were advertised as general-purpose tongs. I didn't try them on toast, but they never had enough tension to grab anything (e.g., pasta, corn on the cob, roasted red peppers). They just broke at the top, so now I'll be throwing them away."
5,Getting daily use.,"Before we had these it was always a struggle to get smaller items out of the toaster, now these are sitting right there they are used for almost everything. A great accessory :)"
1,Overpriced,"You can buy these for about $2 or less at any chinese grocery store. These are made of bamboo, not real wood so asking almost $10 is a rip-off."
4,Overlooked Fun SF Novel,"This novel is one of Lin Carter's most overlooked. It has never been published in hardback before, and to my knowledge was only published once in paperback. It is however a fine example of the type of science fiction being written by Roger Zelazny and Samuel Delany during the late sixties and early seventies, and probably the best pure SF novel Carter ever wrote."
3,Not as colorful as pictured,"The real item is actually faded and ugly. Not true to size, if you wear large, order the medium."
1,Really Disappointed,"I was very happy to find this item on Amazon as it was exactly the style I wanted for our den. Unfortunately it is well below the quality I was looking for. It came poorly packaged and with no instructions or product information. We have replaced every light fixture in our house and do not consider ourselves amateurs, however this fixture gave us fits. I had to come back to the Amazon product description to find out the correct size of light bulbs so that we could actually put the globe on. Remember, you get what you pay for and with this product apparently you aren't paying for instructions (even in a foreign language or just pictures)."
4,A talented movie director for 50 years.,"Frank Thompson has re-edited some interviews with silent-film director Henry King into chronological order. King talks of his days as an actor, and then a silent film director. In the 1930's he moved to the Fox studios and directed many good films (including some classics such as THE GUNFIGHTER [1950]). King talks about Daryl Zanuck (the mogul at Fox) and many film stars such as Lillian Gish, Ronald Coleman, Gary Cooper, and Gregory Peck. The book has an excellent filmography in the back, plus a few pictures of King throughout the years."
2,Not well designed...,"Purchased these to replace a pair that broke on a recent 1,000 mile trip which had some rough roads involved. Have had multiple pairs of other brands and been pleased. These are poorly designed for both boat protection as well as secure attachment. The part of the strap that protects the boat from damage from the metal is too small and my boat sustained scratch damage from chaffing. Will replace these with a better pair as soon as possible..."
3,Decent,"Would start by saying almost everything by Steel Pulse is worth having. This is definately a good record. Not as catchy, or commercial as some would say, as True Democracy. A little more of an old school sound than there other records."
1,it stopped working two days after i got it,"i got it promptly for amazon which was great, it was for my mother in law for mothers day. It looked gorgeous online and when i got it but it stopped working the following day, now i have to take it to a local shop here to try and get it fixed."
1,Worked for two weeks,Received the watch it is beautiful. Took to jeweler to get links taken out. Jeweler informed me needs new movement. That would cost more than the watch. Terrible for a Seiko
5,An outstanding program for workplaces.,I have used this workbook for years in the field of continuing education for human service professionals. The activities are without exception always well received and truly helpful to participants. Very few books present the facilitator steps so clearly. This book is appropriate for any organization that serves people in crisis or trauma. I don't see how you could go wrong if you follow the format pesented.
4,vicarious trauma,Wonderfully simple book on dealing with stuff that builds up in life.Things and aCTION TO REDUCE stressfull situations that build up in this life.I also will pass on how important it is to keep what you hear to yourself because many people can be hurt.
1,great book but where's the disc?,"i purchased this book also thinking that the disc would come with it. it did not, and now i have to track it down somewhere. the grammar in the book it teaches is really important stuff! though it does not give you all of the translations, so you may need to have a dictionary, too"
1,French Grammar that I do not recommend using,"I teach French and this book sucks. I bought it used for like 50cent, which is good, b/c I have not been able to use it for my classes. The grammar is disorganized and coupled oddly. Also - while it has some first year concepts/grammar, it uses 2nd/3rd year vocabulary."
3,Too much food.,"The story itself (outlined by other reviewers so I needn't repeat it) was quite interesting and entertaining, and for the most part I enjoyed the book. What bugged me was the obsession with food. Savannah is constantly thinking of food, preparing food, serving food, eating food, and all this gets tiresome after a while. So she's a fat woman who is unapologetic about who she is - that's fine, but the theme doesn't have to be hammered to death. Moreover, in a world where so many go hungry, perhaps one should be apologetic for constantly pigging out."
4,"LOVELY DESIGNS, but.........","the books is extremely cumbersome to use and not very practical in time saving by today's standards. One cannot put the page needed on a light box because there are patterns and pictures on the same paper opposite page. It is a tightly bound 8 1/2"" x 11"" and it is difficult to use in a scanner. Designs are sometimes pictured on two pages which means one has to cut and tape if a scanner is used. If a quilter does not have a scanner, she/he is left to draw out all of the designs, which is extremely time consuming. Ms. Benvin would have a 5 star book if she could offer convenience in the same package, such as one side printing and spiral binding to make the book easy to use. Her designs and research are tops, however. Thank you!"
1,overpriced,The price of these bars is outrageous. The company that makes them charges $10.00 less per box than Amazon.
4,doesn't work with Windows 7,"I wanted to use this with my Windows 7 computer, but the computer didn't like it. :( But my Windows XP computer did, so now we're just using it with that one. So knock off one star since we're not using it with the computer we wanted to use it with, but keep the rest of the stars since it's such a hoot to look at. :P"
2,Sweetie Loved It.....,"Until it failed to work.I gave it to him last year at Christmas. An avid fisherman, he was enchanted with it. The size was perfect for his larger hand. He refrained from hooking it to a PC at the time and it languished on the shelf, a conversation piece and sometime object of envy from his friends.I built Sweetie a Media PC for his birthday. He recently took it home and hooked it up to his television, plugged in his all-but-brand-new mouse and got nothing. So he tried it in another PC. Nothing. Plugged in a known-good mouse to the Media PC and it worked. His lure mouse had sat on a shelf for almost a year and came up a dud.<sigh>Maybe it was just this one mouse. I hope so. I'll get Sweetie another fishing lure mouse and we'll see."
3,"Cute Mouse, but has Ergonomic Issues","I bought as a gift for Christmas and the vendor was great and on time. The issue lies with the size and angle of the mouse. While using it for 40 minutes, my wrist cramped and hurt for a few hours. My hands are small and I attributed the pain to the mouse size. Upon further use by my 6'3 boyfriend, he complained of pain in his wrist as well. Very cute, but poor ergonomic design."
4,Tome that covers every possible aspect of Linux,"I can't fault this book for how big it is. I usually find super huge tomes to be of inconsistent quality across the chapters, but this book has consistently high quality organization, text and use of graphics across all of the chapters. As you would expect the book starts with installation, it then covers use of the operating system from the desktop level. After that it goes into the file system using the shell, and ends up with the with shell programming.All of the code and shell stuff is hilighted for clarity. The text is not stiff, but isn't so loose as to be annoying. This isn't a reference, it's an end to end walkthrough. If you are looking to use Linux at the end-user level this is a well balanced book that will familiarize you with all of the basics."
2,Too Much Entry Level Information,This book is not for would be admins. The writer wasted a lot of time in explaining mundane stuff. I don't understand why all those reviewers gave so much praise for this merely entry level book.
1,Belongs in the Linux for Dummies line of publishing ...,"With all due respect, this is trully a waste of your time if you are expecting to get info on Fedora Core. Page after page is burned on such trivialities as 'ls', and 'cat' commands; even how to delete a word or a line using an editor. In reality, this book has very little to say anything specific for Fedora. It may have a redeeming value as an intro to Linux for newbies...but flops in this respect as well; newbies will look at the title and continue browsing for other books. You can have mine for free if after reading this you are still considering buying it."
2,A practical guid to Red Hat?,I have read the other reviews of this book. All got to say is that I feel that most of them must have read a different book! I not completely new to Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise but I am no expert so I thought the book would be very suitable for me how wrong can you be. I give you an example Samba very popular application. Can be difficult to setup with the in-built Fedora Firewall. The book chapter is useless in giving you a real tutorial on how to really get the program working it gives you a little bit of information than completel lets you down. This is only an example chapter after chapter are like this. My recommadation if you learning Linux buy an other Red Hat book.
3,Not as good as what you'd expect,This game is extremely hard & really not what you'd expect for Knight Rider. I normally don't like games to be easy but this is just waaaay to hard. I've had friends who play video games all day try it & they couldn't get past the first level since it's also a bit difficult to control. The only reason I gave it three stars instead of one is because it's Knight Rider & I loved the show.
1,Impossible to Play.,"I've never been good at racing/driving games, and Knight Rider is no exception. It's just a terrible game, and I am unable to get out of first level because of the impossibility of maneuvering through the road while avoiding being hit by bullets. The shield is just too low to start off the game. Forget the game...it's a waste of time."
1,game sucks,this game sucks has no plot to it not only that but the company who sent it took a month to get it to me
3,definition,"Altho I found the text very informative, the pictures lack definition. Not knowing the age of the first edition, I was hoping that some of the pictures would be in colour."
2,"Incomplete, not rigorous","The book was incomplete and not sufficiently rigorous. Covers same ground as many other, better-written books.D.O."
2,OK depending on who you are,"Not of much use to the professional finance person.Should put out free erata with book.Liked APT treatment.Fine for very theoretical readers,who are already familiar with material."
2,Cut and Paste,"As mentioned by another reviewer, it seems like there is a lot of cut and pasted material from better texts.This book might be good for advanced undergrad/first year grad intro to emperical Finance, but it is not anywhere near Duffie. It does not offer sound quantitative proofsI like Duffie, and don't like this book at all. You might find the GMM stuff a little useful."
1,Model Textbook,"Cochrane has written the model for a bad textbook. The elements include recycled material, the absence of clarifying narrative, and the absence of applications.This book has no real world sample problems and therefore no real world solutions. There is no evidence in this textbook to suggest the author is capable of solving real world finance problems. It's a mystery how students are supposed to learn asset pricing from this text.There is no value added in presenting well-worn equations with zero interpretation. This book is weakened by presenting old theory with no useful discourse."
2,Not very accessible,"This book might be a good reference for someone who is already intimately familiar with the different asset pricing theories discussed in the book.This book is definitely not the best book to study to learn about these different asset pricing models for the first time. In other words, it often jumps from one assertion to another without connecting all the dots; those who don't have a fairly extensive background in asset pricing theory are likely to have a hard time bridging many of the transitional gaps in the text."
2,"Thin book, thin information","There is some interesting information, yes, but there are also many inaccuracies, and unfortunately, it was more applicable a few years back. I commend it only because it was the first Roswell book out there, but it doesn't include all the stars. If you're interested in details, look at Crash Into Me: The World of Roswell. Frankly, I found it to be more informative."
5,Great!,I loved this book because Roswell is one of my favorite shows and it was great to be able to learn more about its stars. The Roswell High series is also wonderful. You should really read them.
5,Roswell is Awesome!,"I think this book was really great! I love reading about the lives of the stars of my favorite series! Especially Jason Behr, I love Jason Behr!"
1,Falsely titled!,"This disc is falsely titled ""the best of Bride"". a better name for it would be ""the worst of bride"", since this is not a compilation of Brides best songs through the years, but rather a compilation of their two worst albums ""Jesus Experience"" and ""Oddities"" (with a couple of Dale's solo songs thrown in). To sum it up, I would say this CD is a sad mixture of great lyrics coupled with terrible music that makes it unlistenable. the only bright spot is ""If I told you it was the end of the world"" which at least has something that resembles a hook in a song. Aside from that, this disc is not worth 30 cents (which is how much people are desperately trying to get rid of this disc for), unless you're a die-hard bride disc collector and must have everything they ever released. (I gave it one star only because there was no zero star option)"
2,Good unit until you want to update the maps.,"I bought this unit and now I constantly get a ""signal is too low"" warning, when driving in the same areas where I didn't have this problem before. Called LG customer service and was advice they don't service this model any more and referred me to a 3rd party repair for assistance.Unit works ok, until you have to update the maps....not possible."
2,LG's income insurance plan,"Generally speaking this GPS performs pretty well. My main complaint would be that it was bought in 2009, showed up with 2006 maps installed, and LG wants $100 to upgrade to the current maps. So ignore the price tag if you want a GPS with current maps, because LG's going to charge you $100 extra for that luxury."
2,Horrible GPS and worse customer service,"Bought this GPS, which came with an outdated 2006 map. When trying to update, we were informed by LG that we needed to purchase a new map for $100. Again, this came preinstalled with an OLD map and now they want us to purchase. All other companies allow you to download the new maps for free. DO NOT, DO NOT buy an LG GPS!!! Do not buy an LG products."
1,no good DO NOT BUY THIS,"I got this gps two years ago, although it will work pretty well for a while , it will start tofreeze and you will have to reset it and lose all stored info in order for it to work again. But the main reason not to buy it is YOU WILL NEVER FIND ANY UPDATES, Even if you talk to a service rep from LG. FAIR WARNING .Buy a garmin ...At least you can depend on them. ART"
1,Garbage,"I got this thing out of the bargain bin for 20 bucks, and i feel ripped offFirst of all, feeding it paper is PICKY. You can't have just 1 sheet in the tray, you can't have 100 sheets in the tray, you need to have 20 to 30 sheets in the traySecondly, the paper need to be in just the right amount. Too far down and it jams. Not far enough and the printer thinks its empty.This thing EATS ink.. and i mean guzzles it. You'll be lucky if you can print enough test pages to get it properly working before it tells you you're out of ink and refuses to print.Lastly, for some reason, the black and white cartridge never likes to admit its been loaded. Maybe its shy."
3,"The color print speed is a little slow, but It does the job.","The printer is for my mother, So only she can really rate this item. but when I set it up for her. I notice there was no USB cord inside, even though the manual mentions it and the cover box. So they should've mentioned ""USB Cord NOT INCLUDED"". But my mom is fairly satisfied."
5,Shabbat,This is a great book for two year olds. I use it in my preschool class. we can talk a long time in this subject.The kids like it.
3,Nothing New,"If you're a beginner as in just starting out,you'll pick up few ideas but I didn't see anything in the book that was new."
1,Poor Graphics and jigs are too complicated,"The other people who reviewed this must be freinds of the author. I thought the book was was poorly written, the graphics were weak and most of the jigs would take longer to build than the space shuttle. It may be OK for the VERY advanced wood worker, but surely not your weekend warrior!"
1,Good for ideas only.,"I got this book a few years ago and got some great ideas from it. I did find that there are a lot of steps missing to get from point A to point B. I found measurements that were incorrect and very fustrating. I have been a woodworker for over 15 years so I know how to ""measure twice, cut once"" but with this book, you're on your own. Another thing I found frustrating is let's say you want to build a router table. Well to cut the dados they refer you to a fence earlier in the book. To make that fence, you need the router table. Poorly organized. Check out Pat Warner's books instead."
3,Go with his update,"I bought this book and Hylton's updated book and wish I had only purchased the most recent. This book was out of date and redundant with his newer, more comprehensive book. His other book was Professional router jigs and techniques that any woodworker can use (or something like that)."
2,Router magic and fixtures,"It's a good book for experts,not beginners like me.Too complex for me.The jigs are very elaborate.Also thought the pictures were not very clear."
4,Router Secrets From The Router Master,"What Bill Hylton doesn't know about routers is very little, and not worth knowing. This book is showing its age a little, and could do with a new edition. I still love it and am intent on building a number of the jigs in it (gotta love the router lathe!). Some of the jigs are covered in Mr Hylton's newer books with much-improved versions, such as his mortising jig. Still a great book and still full of ideas for improving your collection of router jigs :)"
5,How many ways can you spell fantastic!,"I built the main table in the book (a little higher, with a an additional drawer, wheels, and a lucite chamber door from a certain PBS woodworker). The instructions are as close to idiot proof as can be. I'll surely build a half dozen of the jigs and fixtures by year end.My aprons off (or maybe that's on)to you Bill!!"
3,Worth it for $7,"My daughter likes this magazine. However, I was less then pleased when I received an email AFTER paying for the order stating that this magazine is not sent our regularly and that they could not guarantee how often, or not, we would receive it. I think I should have been notified of this PRIOR to ordering the subscription."
3,Teen Vogue - every so often,"I subscribed to this for my niece's birthday, but only AFTER purchase, did I find out that the publication prints on an ""unscheduled"" basis. Why don't they show this info up front? And how many issues does it work out to be?The price was cheap, but I hope the purchase was worthwhile, since it's a gift."
3,Nice magazine,"Teen Vogue is a nice magazine for teens. Has some nice stories & lots of fashion ideas. Does seem to be a bit overloaded with ads for product after product, which seems the norm for magazines like these."
4,Perfect teenage girl gift,"We gave this to my boyfriend's 12-yr-old niece (who has every imaginable tech toy someone could have!) for Christmas this year and it was the perfect gift! She's just coming into her own now and has lots of curiousity about make-up, clothes, accessories, etc. This mag helps her figure some of that stuff out on her own without the influence of her friends or worse yet, parents---yuck! It's so cute how excited she gets when her mag comes in the mail! She's like a mini-me of an adult getting their People."
1,"Ordered a Subscription, Never Received an Issue","I'm sure the magazine is fine, my daughter liked it at the book store. So, for her 13th birthday, we ordered her a subscription. They initially told us that it would take five weeks to get it started but after six weeks we checked on the status and they assured us that it would be delivered soon. Well, after three months we gave up and cancelled the order after not receiving any issues, only promises that they'd be delivered soon. We were outraged when we received a notice informing us that we'd receive less than have of what we'd paid as a refund because we'd waited so long to cancel the order. We've sent a note to customer service and we'll update this review when we've heard something back but we don't intend to place any magazine subscriptions through Amazon again."
1,take long time to get it,"i bought the subscription for my daughter. i have nothing to write about because i have not got any issue yet, even i paid for it more than a month ago. it takes long time. hopefully i will write an update review when i finally get it."
1,dont ask your daughters what they think,I checked out teen vogue at my local newsstand. G-d forbid such a magazine should come into my house.A more appropriate name for this magazine is HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DAUGHTER TO BE A PROSTITUTE.Know this before buying such a magazine for your children or grandchildren.Don't tell me I am going overboard. I am a mother of three daughters and this is not the way to educate a girl.
3,Teen Vogue,"I usually like this type of magazine, but Teen Vogue was just boring. Advertisements every other page and almost no interesting articles.The funnest thing about the magazine is sniffing the perfume samples."
2,Auto renew extortion,"All of the magazines I subscribe to now have automatic renewal (not my choice). It is not a ""benefit,"" it's a scam. I pay by check so that they can't just charge my card, so they have to send me a notice. If you don't pay right away, they send a nasty notice that they are going to report you to the credit bureau as a delinquent account if you don't send them money! It isn't easy to cancel, either; I had to send 3 cancel requests to Southern Living before they would cancel my subscription."
3,Respects the Fashion Industry,"I started getting Teen Vogue as a free offer from Delia's and I'll probably renew because it's so cheap and I love collaging, etc. But also, it's a pretty good magazine. I am a very frugal shopper, so I'd never buy any of the stuff in here, but I like that it's more about the fashion industry than superficial teens. To me, this magazine respects the fashion industry and makes being interested in clothes seem like a genuine hobby or career path. I also love taking a cute outfit from the magazine and then looking up cheaper counterparts online, making a wearable version of the Teen Vogue outfit. Other articles are okay and sometimes interesting. I happen to like its smaller size, something some other reviewers disliked - it makes it portable and cuter in a way. It's a good choice if you like getting inspired or are truly interested in the industry of fashion - most of the stuff here is not necessarily wearable but artsy types would love."
2,Teen Voque,"I ordered this magazine for my daughter and when it came the magazine was only 7"" X 10"". It was so small and the contents wasn't that good."
4,I like this magazine!,"I thought that this magazine had really cute stuff, awesome tips, and I love when I get it in the mail. Yes, the stuff is kind of expensive, but that is part of the fun! You see what is trendy in the $200+ range and find the same stuff for your price range.Overall, this was a very good magazine."
2,Eh... not so much.,"This magazine isn't really a great magazine for offering fashion advice. It has a lot of pictures of brands that ordinary girls will never be able to afford. The whole magazine is just flipping through designer brand ads and perfume samples. There are hardly any articles and I found it kind of a waste of my time because it's always the same ads over and over and it doesn't really help much in the beauty department, which is its main goal."
1,Skip this one,"I ordered this for my 16 year old daughter, assuming she would love it since she likes all the teen magazines (Seventeen, CosmoGirl, M, etc.). She hates it. Glanced through the first couple of issues, but now tosses it directly in the trash. I'm glad I bought it when there was a promotion that paid me to take it ($7 for the magazine, $10 toward a future purchase for buying it), because it would have been a complete waste of money."
1,I was UNIMPRESSED with this book,"To be honest, I wish I had not spent my money. Any kitchen cookbook has many of the recipes found in this.From reading it, I would not say that Marina Bear American as many of the ingredients of the ""unusual"" recipes simply cannot be found in your local store so the book is a waste of money.Perhaps if you lived in Mongolia, it would be of some use.My 2 cents."
5,is a different rhithm an excellent singer,in my recent trip to jamaica i heard this singer and i thought it was great. its a contagius rhithm so i recommend it.
2,Ok as a quick reference tool.,"This isn't at all comprehensive, but is fine for speedy access to common words."
1,Lacking information!!!,"I wanted a dictionary with explanations, etc. This only had words. Nothing more. Info on how to pronounce the word, meanings, This, my friends is not a dictionary. All it is is a list of words, nothing more. ."
2,This Book leaves alot to be disired!,"I would not reccomend this dictionary, it leaves a lot of word out , and it not user friendly; I would buy a better dictionary next time."
3,High-Performance Pontiacs 1955-1974 (S-A Design Performance History,"The material is detailed and well presented, the specifications quite good and the photographs are very good. However there is little information or details about the racing exploits of these high performance vehicles, nothing about the ministrations of renowned mechanics and little, other than superficial references, about their success in the hands of notable drivers. Perhaps I expected 'high performance' to apply to the 'track' more so than the 'road'."
4,Good book for a pilot transitioning to a twin,"This text is quite explanatory and provides the necessary insight for pilots transitioning to twins. It deals with the issue of two engines, lift and drag, thrust, the technical skill required if an engine fails etc. Solid training material."
3,A strange collection...,"It combines some of his most known (Te Sigo Amando, Hasta Que Te Conocí, & Siempre en Mi Mente) with some that are relatively obscure (Nunca Lo Sabré, Nunca Lo Sabras; Donde Estás Mi Vida, Que No Diera Yo). The inclusion of Amor Eterno from Celebrando 25 Años instead of from El Palacio de Bellas Artes is just bizarre, since he doesn't even sing on it.Para Ti: 14 Exitos has a way better tracklisting.3 stars for the collection, 5 stars for the music."
4,OVERALL SCORE: (A-/B+),"This is a very good story that takes place in the Yuan-ti controlled city of Hloondeth, deep in the Vilhon Reach. The story centers around a psionic/rouge Arvin, a human who accidentally gets caught up in plots beyond his understanding. This is a edgy (for Forgotten Realms) mystery, while the violence is less than many of this genre, the strange dream sequences me be more `mature' than what readers have come to expect from Forgotten Realms books.[The back cover is extremely misleading, the person who is listed as the main character `Dediana', never appears in the book! While this is not a reflection on the author or the book itself, it was very slipshod of the publishers.]OVERALL SCORE: (A-/B+)READABILITY: (A-), PLOT: (A), CHARATERS: (A), DIALOGUE: (B-), SETTING: (B+), ACTION/COMBAT: (B-), MONSTERS/ANTAGONISTS: (A+), ROMANCE: (?+), SEX: (Moderate), AGE LEVEL: (PG13)"
3,"Flawed, but better than expected.","(Another 3.5 rating) Halfway in, I was thinking 3 stars at the most as it's so blatantly a marketing piece for some of WoTC's newest game supplements - specifically, the Expanded Psionics Handbook and Serpent Kingdoms - but it actually got better as it moved along as Smedman proves to be a pretty decent writer. Relatively speaking. This is solid hackwork, following the D&D formula to the letter. As a fan, that's not necessarily a bad thing as she works the formula well. The main character, Arvin, is a bit annoying at times, though, and his primary motivation - rescuing/avenging a friend - isn't really made believable until nearly the end of the book. Worthwhile read for fans of the Forgotten Realms, but anyone looking for innovative fantasy is better served by Jessica Rydill's work."
3,A fair start to a promising trilogy,"I wish there was .5 options for the ratings as this book would have gotten a 3.5.I really do ejoy Ms. Smedman's work, yet this book at times seemed a little slow to me. I attribute this to a couple things - 1) She is setting up pretty much a new race and needs to fully explain the nuiances of the race. 2) Not many books have been written about the 'powers' used in this book - so again more explanation is needed. 3) Just a new part of the Realms, so again more explanation.Once you get through all the description and explanation there is actually a good plot/story in this book. The characters seemed a little forced at times, but overall they are well written.Well this certainly isn't the best book I have read written in the Realms, it's not the worst either. I enjoyed the second book much more than the first. Read my review there to find out why. ;-)"
3,Not bad for game fiction...,"Yes, it was a blatant marketing trick. Yes, you could occasionally see the die rolls. But that describes most game fiction.At least it was well-written...and it went into lots of intriguing detail on the wonderfully creepy yuan-ti. A pity the second book in the trilogy nowhere near lives up to such promise."
5,A Personal Transformation,Personal experiences mixed with arguments about transgender issues provide the reader with insight about what it really means to be a transsexual.
5,Great book for anyone to read.,"This is an easy, fun, and interesting read. The book rekindled my sensitivity and respect for humanity."
5,GARY MOORE- OLD NEW BALLADS BLUES,"Gary Moore is the master of the blues. He is just as amazing in his writing abilities of ballads, that have a very melodic theme, and deep lyrics. Highly recommended for a new look at the other side of Gary Moore!"
4,A summary of the Spanish American War.,"At a little over 200 pages, this book covers the main battles of the Spanish American War. These include the two naval battles off Santiago and Manila, and the land campaigns in Puerto Rico,Cuba and the Philippine Islands. So if you are into the military aspect of the war, this is the book for you. If you need the political reasons, see Trask's book about the war or another called Empire by Default. This is a good summary of the war, but not an explanation for the reason of the war. However, the book is well written and very readable."
3,Did anyone proof this?,"This is a very good book if you are intersted in an overview of the military action during the Spanish/American war.I enjoyed it, but the typos where embarrassing. It appears that the only proof-reading was with a spellchecker. This is why I graded it as only 3 stars."
5,Great gift,I purchased these nuts as a gift for my daughter. She loved them! They are delicious and a high quality product.
5,Cause I love you,"I love his singing style. Lyrics you can understand and music that moves you, I brought back memories from my first love."
4,good compilation,"if Lenny Williams only sang ""Cause I Love you"" then he could have retired and know he did the thang because that one slow jam is timeless.OOO OOO,OOO, OOO,OOO!!!! that is what time it is. he sang the Keys off the Piano with that song. one of those songs where you ain't ever going to forget. that is some songwrting and that is some serious Sanging. Grown folks Sanging there. the breakdown and instrumentation is tight and his narrative is classic. back in the day before there was 99 channels on and the tv would go foggy. pre cable era, but it is cool. good material here and a good collection."
2,Such great promise!,"I've had a DC300 for a couple of years. Once I got Disc Manager software, the DC300 became one of my most useful possessions. (The CD Library software is horrible.) Unfortunately, recently my computer stopped recognizing the DC300 - it said ""USB device not recognized"". I tried another PC and had the same problem. I wrote to Dacal asking for support; they responded promptly and suggested I try a few things, which I did, but none worked. Subsequently I wrote to Dacal FIVE times and just asked whether the unit could be repaired, and they DID NOT RESPOND AT ALL to any of my emails. I think the DC300 is a good idea, but I cannot recommend a product made by a company that ignores its customers when problems arise."
1,No excuse for such poor software,"The contraption itself is not bad, but the software is inexcusably bad. Aside for poor functionality, no help, inaccurate user manual, it also crashes losing all your input sine the last backup. There is no way to export your data to a text or spreadsheet file. While the program doesadd ""contents"" of the disc to the database, it only picks up the top level folder. If you want use this device off line, without the software it would work ok, but it's not worth the price. I am sending mine back for a refund."
1,Poorly made,"This stapler is poorly designed because its hard to use. Positioning where to fasten is not easy. Also, it produce a disturbing sound even if it claims 70% less effort. Not a good product from Swingline."
4,Best stapler ever,"Easy on your hand... from repetitive motion use, my hand is not as strong as it used to be. This stapler requires little effort to use and does not jam. I had inherited this stapler from my predecessor, and when I moved departments, I requested this particular model when ordering my office supplies."
2,If only it lasted...,"I agree with the other reviews: this stapler can handle a significant number of pages, staple smoothly, and react with the lightest touch. However, it doesn't last. I have had this on my desk since August - as of October 27, I have had to throw mine away. It was irretrievably jammed. My husband and I both had a go at it but couldn't get the staple tray to open now matter how many levers and joints we tweaked and tugged. This wasn't the first time it had jammed; over the past couple months of use, it had jammed severely twice - the staples didn't come through cleanly and sometimes got twisted. I could always open the staple drawer and pull it out with tweezers or staple remover. The third time's the charm I guess, and now it won't unjam at all. Apparently it doesn't have the stamina to last 2 months. Perhaps I got a lemon? Still, I guess it's back to the cheaper manual stapler for me!"
2,you get what you pay for,"I own both these and the Sennheiser pxc300's. The Sennheisers win hands down, The Sennheisers also cost about 7 times as much. These Kensingtons are much larger and cover more of the ears, but nowhere near the noise-killing quality of the others. (but the price is also much less) These kill a little bit of noise, but they introduce a hiss.. basically, it is like turning Dolby NR off and hearing the hiss (if you remember those days). I will use these around the house to watch vids on my machine, but when I am sitting in the back row of a MD80 next to a P&W..I am not gonna use these. No problems with weight or comfort. Sound is good enough. Cellular interference is awful. So.. were they worth the price? yeah, but not too functional as noisekillers."
4,Excellent value for the price,"Very effective inside a plane comparing to the other noise cancelling headphone I have. Sound is ok for what it does. However, in a moving vehicle, it actually distorts the music which is a surprise. My other noise-cancelling headphone does not do that. It appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite noise-cancelling wave. By the time the opposite wave applies to the music, the intruding noise is over. Otherwise, no complains."
2,didn't work well for me,"although the headphones were comfortable, i found they didn't ""cancel"" much of anything...i also found there was a lot of ""feedback"" sounds that just made using them not possible.... i haven't tried the expensive alternatives but for me, this set just didn't deliver"
3,Just Okay,"After reading other reviews of this product they sounded like just what I wanted. After receiving them and trying them for a few weeks I find I am disappointed. The headphones themselves are ""okay"" but the ""noise cancelling"" function doesn't seem to do much at all."
2,No noise canceling,"The headphones work, as headphones, but there is no noise canceling going on. There is a switch for on/off but there is no difference in the sound background sound in either setting. When the noise canceling is turned on (requires a battery) and the red LED comes on there is white noise added to the music. This is annoying and detracts from the quality of the music. I've tried it in several different quiet to noisier environments of different noise types.I wouldn't waste the money on these again."
3,Great for the price!,"This is an very good product considering the price. I had a sharper image model that I lost in a plane. I replaced them with this model, Im very happy with them. If you can afford the $300.00 ones then go for it. But for less than $40.00 this is a good choice."
1,Worthless,Not worth taking on an airplane. Hard to tell if the headphones cancel more noise than they create.
1,Not worth it,I don't know what they actually do....except boost the volume and bass a bit...I needed Winter head phones and they don't even cover my ears...
1,Not what I expected,I was carried away by the cost of this product. It does not cancell any noise whatsoever. At best it can be used as a earpiece. Dissapointed.
1,terrible,"Well let me start off by saying, I am a pretty small person with pretty small features. I always have an issue with things like, say, hats... normal sizes are generally a bit too big and children's sizes are way too small. I tried these headphones on and they were WAY TOO BIG. Too wide. They don't hug my head or my ears at all. They just kind of sit there. And if I moved at all they would just flop off of my head. This makes the noise cancelling feature pointless because the ear parts weren't on my ears correctly. I read a review about children wearing them... well, they must not be picky children. I know how a good pair of headphones is supposed to feel, and this certainly is not it."
1,Disappointing performance,"After reading many reviews about these headphones, I was quite excited to order them. However, I was very disappointed once I received them. In my opinion, these headphones did a very poor job cancelling out background noise. In fact, if it weren't for a faint humming noise, I couldn't even tell when the headphones were on or off. I returned these, and am once again on the hunt for a reasonably priced set of noise cancelling headphones."
1,Not a Noise Cancelling Headphone,"This headset does not perform Noise Cancellation, but only inceases the volume on the headset. Do not waste your money for a noise cancelling headset in this headset, but if you want just a head set with amplification, then this headset would be OK"
2,Not as advertised,"Bought for my wife. She doesn't find them effective noise cancelling headphones, but they may be used as regular headphones. Would like a refund!"
1,Very poor reliability,"These are not at all reliable.These sound bad too, they just add a hiss and boost the sound thats all."
4,Best noise cancelling phones for the price,I've had three different makes of noise cancelling headphones and these are easily the best for under $100 and possibly close to $200. I haven't flown with them yet but using them while cutting my grass told they are very comfortable and seem to lack that somewhat annoying hiss ever present in lower priced n/c headphones. I think by now most purchasers of these type of headphones know they don't completely shut out the outside world but these do a much better job of that than most. I'll reserve a 5 star rating for the $299-$349 Bose but these actually are a 4*+!Very nice product.
3,Overall good value,"The headphones I have seem to muffle music. The clarity just isn't there. I haven't tried another pair of noise cancelling headphones so I can't say if they are all like that. The noise cancelling does help reduce outside noise and let you escape to your own 'world' through music. Although, for the price I can get use to the sound quality."
5,They work great,"Great deal for the money. They're soft and wrap around the ear which helps keep out sounds you don't want to hear. Works great on planes, with the sound canceling turned on you can't hear any annoying plane noise."
2,Fragile headphones,"I purchased a Kensington product as I previously purchased Kensington and was satisfied with the product. The Kensington noise cancelling headphones were another matter. The first time I used them in flight (on a 17hour non-stop to Africa) they broke at the right hand hinge and no amount of effort was I able to make a satisfactory repair. Most disappointing. On closer examination back home, it was apparent that the hinge was of an inferior design and,in my opinion, was not fit for purpose. Very disappointing. To return them from where I stay in South Africa is not an option as the postage would exceed the cost of the original purchase."
3,Of some assistance. Doesn't work as expected.,"I bought the headset primarily for it's noise canceling feature. I found that while it reduces external sound somewhat, it doesn't work to the extent that I thought it would. I think this is partially due to the fact that the headphones don't cover my ears completely. I don't think I have particularly large ears, but these headphones don't pass the lobes.All in all, it's not bad, but not great.I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Don't expect a miracle,"Bottomline is, they are below average in noise cancellation and somewhat at the average in sound quality. I took them on a plane once, they did nice job in cancelling the plane's low-frequency humming, but I still could hear my neighbors very clearly. The best usage I find for them is while working in my home office to suppress disctructing outside noises.There's also a concern about quality, the rubber strip that goes around the top of a head ripped off after only a year. After inspecting the way it was attached I figured out I would have given up anyway even if it treated them if they were golden.I guess the only attractive part in these headphones is the way they collapse. They look rather big unfolder, but can fit inside your jacked pocket folded."
4,best buy,"These headphones block airplane noise, train noise, and any continuous sound. At the price, they are certainly a better buy than Bose."
3,OK but not great,"These are decent headphones but the noise cancelation is not very impressive. They are comfortable, sound good, and the folding is nice so at this price point, it's hard to expect much more."
3,The band doesn't last long,"I bought this last year but have used it very rarely. Today the band, which sets the headphones on the head, broke. Now the headphones can't fit.. so almost useless. Poor Quality."
2,Disappointed Big Time,"I purchased these from Kim Komando's website. They did not indicate the brand name and as a result I paid double for these headphones. Not that $20 is a big deal but the sound quality was a major disappointment. Muddled, muddy, flat treble are some of the adjectives I have seen to discribe the sound. Moreover, the balance was heavy on the left which is irritating. The more I listen, the better it seems to get and when I think, well maybe these aren't so bad after all, I put on my Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones and it is the difference between day and night. The only thing I can positive is the noise cancelling quality is pretty decent if you want quiet, provided you don't want to listen to music at the same time. Anybody that says these are comparable to Sennheiser or Bose has to have a major hearing problem."
3,Works As Advertised,"I needed a pair of headphones that I could use on airplanes that would actually allow me to hear what was playing. To that end these work as advertised. The ear cups are comfortable (wore them for over 3 hours in-flight). I could hear the movie I was watching while the drone of the plane's engines faded into the background.Some may complain about the sound quality, bass, frequency response and such. To them I say go ahead and spend the extra money (A lot of extra money). For the majority of users these will work just fine. Great value for the money"
3,Ok for the money,"These are okay for the money. Maybe I am expecting too much from noise cancelling headphones. I find it really only kicks up the low to mid range. They are pretty comfortable for short term use. If I wear them for 1 hour or more, my ears start to get sore. I would hope that the more expensive brands do a better job. These fold up nicely, come with a carry bag and an airplane adapter which is a nice touch."
2,Poor Quality Control,Purchased these headphones on-line. They work great when not using the noice cancellation function. However when turning the noice cancellation function on any move of the wire running into the headphone causes the headphones to make a popping sound. I will assume there is loose wire or connection inside the headphone that is causing this. This should have been caught by quality control at the place of manufacture.
3,headphones not so much of noise cancelling,"The product is just ok, I still hear almost everything from the outside, I probably will never recomend this product"
1,Lies from Satan,"Tim LaHaye is yet another servant of Satan, lying in the name of God to hurt His children. He is writing to tell hateful and ignorant people who do not know the love of Jesus what they want to believe."
2,leaves something to be desired,"This book might be useful to those who have no familiarity with new findings and theories about Egyptology and Egyptian civilization. It gives a brief overview of these new ideas and findings about Egypt's age, understanding about the pyramids, etc.WARNING: I have seen advertisements in other sources that promote this book as a detailed study on the theory of Egypt's pre-historic antiquity, dating back 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 years. Although the book touches on this topic, it doesn't go into it in great detail. There are probably better sources for this.I would also point out that the book discusses theories about the ""true"" identity of some of the Egyptian pharaohs; i.e.; King David, Solomon, Jesus, etc. This is merely the latest in a long list of theories about Egypt, some of which are plausible, and some of which have no foundation (such as this). In my opinion it seems to be a compilation of useful, and not so-useful information about ancient Egypt."
5,Historical Deception,"If you are like me then you need to be proven and shown something, not just told it. I've always felt that a lot of aspects of history that are taught don't quite make sense and a book like this confirms that. This book actually provides proof and examples of the claims made. Anybody wanting to learn the TRUTH about ancient egypt and the bible should definitely own this book. If you are a person that enjoys the bliss of ignorance and would like to be told lies with no backing then I could think of many other books for you."
3,worth reading,"A well organized, facile approach to egyptology. A must read for anyone not too familiar with the world of ancient egypt. I only wish that he could have given the religious texts of other cultures the same objective and enlightened treatment that he had with egyptian texts, instead of a rather shaky inculturated understanding. Still, the ideas in this book are clear, perspicacious, and fascinating, if a bit radical. A lot of information in a relatively easy read."
1,"If this book were a fish, I'd throw it back","I recently bought this book, and I wish I hadn't. The author seems to have noble goals, but I can't say that his arguments are convincing. I could not honestly recommend this book to others."
3,"""E"" is for Evidence","This book is a complete(and yet, somehow revolutionary)reference to the true daily lives of the ancient Egyptians. What I mean when I say ""revolutionary"" is. . .well, it strays away from the beliefs of some historians and Egyptologists, then adds evidence which points out that what the book describes is true. But it compares history with religion at one point and it was quite touchy for me there, which is why I give this otherwise wonderful book but three stars."
3,Bahamadia makes her claim,"Bahamadia debuts on this album and makes a more than fair stake for her claim.Although I think she is wickedly intelligent and tough to talk bad about, I will say that this album does not have a great composition. With only seven tracks, it's hard to really get your head bouncing to any of her cuts. There is no real depth to this album, but she does have great potential for future albums."
3,this is very small 'kollage' Bahamadia,"This ain't a album like Common's Like water.... But it's just true music from an independent woman with skills.I like her style and what she has been doing in the past (from Roni Size till the underrated album of Sweetback)But i think she is capable to do better(and more) than this album, allthough i prefer to call it an EP. This album is just fun because she is a good MC. All she need in the future are great producers (soulquarians, PRIMO, Ski, DJ Spinna, timbaland, and last but defenitily not least Jay dee) under the supervising of Stuart Matthewman."
4,"Pretty good, but....","Not bad but, It's only seven tracks. Nice sound. Sounds like a female version of Dice Raw (The Roots). The only problem i have is the music, overpowers her vocals(I want to here what shes saying.) It's a shame that such a talented artist had a hard time getting a record deal. Check it OUT!!"
2,not enough meat (no pun intended),"If you like female rap then I think you'll dig at least one track on this album, but there isn't much to really sink your teeth into. Track 3 (Commonwealth) is a mellow turn that I really enjoy. I wish the whole album had gone this direction. The rest is good, it just won't suprise you. It's time for a female artist to define a style. What women in hip hop need is something new."
4,well worth the wait.,"For those of you who enjoyed Bahamadia's multiple guest appearances from 1994-1999, this solo album was indeed well worth the wait.In my opinion, there isn't much more refreshing in the hip-hop world today than an intelligent, well-spoken woman who can rhyme the hell out of just about anyone.As well, the beats and production on this album are top notch - including one track with d n' b breaks; truly an eclectic and fun mix of the best hip-hop has to offer."
4,She's hot!,"i say ""whatever"" the the previous reviewer....I think this cd is pretty good. She colaborated with some nice artists and she still has flows...Commonwealth is the bomb and her beats are mellow and deep, way different from all the other music thats being presented today. She kept it real even on this cd! Just really listen to her lyrics. Im glad that she has a certain style that shines out the competition. I just wished that she wasn't ""slept' on. Give her a chance..She's truly talented in the art. I was so chilled out while listening to this cd, im not into all that screaming and excessive cursing most artists think that they have to do to sell their cd. Girlfriend got it goin on!"
4,History and Uniformologist,"This book cover not only the uniforms use in the Crimea War but it gave you a great introduction on what,why,and how this war was fougth by the British Army, the book also cover the importants of this war for the security of the Britains colonial possesions.Inside you can find Uniforms, Fighting Methods, Equipment and Weapons.The text is accompanied by numerous illustration and Photos, including eight full page colour plates by Pierre Turner.To finish I would like to add that this war make some great changes in the form of fighting use by the British also major changes in uniforms and tactics of war."
3,This book was an excellent thriller and it really gripped me,This book was about the hardships that the British had to go through during this war and what young men had to do to stay alive besides the fighting.
3,Typography sucks,"I have ordered the book on Amazon.de, but unfortunately, I had to notice, that the typography of the book is quite bad.The font looks a much ""bolder"" than most other books I have read. Also the lines of the single letters are not really straight and thin lines as I am used to from other books. And the letters seem a little bit skewed. Overall, the legibility of the book suffers in my opinion.I have already ordered a replacement book on Amazon.de, but it looks exactly the same. So I assume the font is by design.I mean, you can read it, but it just isn't as legible as most other books. I can't say much about the content yet, but I think it will be good."
4,Pretty good for his first novel...,"This book, I think, has a lot of potential, as does the author. It reads as though you are experiencing what the characters are feeling. From the abuse that is experienced through the father, to the love, the betrayal, and ultimately the sorrow, i think all too many of us have a story way too familiar to this one to not give it all the credit that it is due. For this being his first novel, it was actually a pretty good job and i am awaiting his next one."
5,one last goodbye from John,"John Denver touched the lives of millions of people. He has left behind a musical legacy that will live on in the hearts and souls of so many of us. These songs are a new collection by the man who we will never forget. Worth having, wonderful to listen to."
1,YUK!,I think John would never have released most of this material. There are a couple of good lines here and there but thats it. It's the first JD material I have not cared to listen to a second time. It should have stayed in storage.
2,John knew what songs to release and what to shelve,"Although it is nice to hear some previously unreleased songs by John Denver, after listening to this CD, it is obvious John knew what songs to release and what to shelve. With a couple of exceptions, this CD has nothing exceptional to offer. It rates about the same level as ""Dreamland Express"" - John's worst effort.For those who want to enjoy the best of John Denver material, I would recommend ""The Flower that Shattered the Stone"", ""Different Directions"", and ""Higher Ground"" - all excellent CD's."
5,Wonderful.,"This is a rare treasure. What was RCA thinking when they let him go. I can only hope there are more songs where these came from. ""On the Wings of an Eagle"" is so beautiful, as is my favorite, ""River"". Give it a listen! You'll love it."
4,Unreleased treasures,"This disc is well worth the attention of anyone who likes the music of John Denver. It contains 10 previously unreleased songs, and two alternative versions of songs. The unreleased songs are gems. Unlike some artists unreleased material, which were unreleased for a good reason, these are fully crafted songs with Denver's clear tenor voice strong, covering a period from 1969 to 1980. Several are from an unreleased album from 1979-1980, and all are terrific. A cover of Ian Tyson's ""Four Strong Winds"" is particularly affecting. A couple songs have writer unknown in the credits, but they are clearly the work of Denver, with images of eagles, flying, freedom, and mountains that were his specialty. Listening to this CD makes the current condition of pop music seem all the more banal."
5,What A Pleasant Surprise!,"I was reluctant to buy this one. After reading a couple of reviews on this CD, I decided to give it a shot. I am very glad that I did. With the 10 previously unreleased tracks, John's spirit lives on through them. I was listening and thought, ""that song sounds like it should have been on Whose Garden Was This"" and that song sounds like it should have been on that album. When reading the leaflet I noticed the dates and said ""Yeah, that's it."" Listening to this CD you can hear how John Denver's voice matured through the years. He really gives the fans one final treat with this CD. One song that impresses me on this CD is ""Four Strong Winds."" This is a Neil Young composition and although Neil, in my opinion, doesn't sing all that great, this track was beautifully done as a duet by Neil Young. John Denver's version is just as beautifully done on such a beautiful song. This CD is a must for any John Denver fan. You won't be disappointed by this one. May he rest in peace!"
2,Not the best,"The author misses many significant changes from the 2002 to the 2005 NEC.Article section 110.26(C)(2) has wording from the 2002 NEC rather than the 2005 NEC.The author calls attention to revised wording in Article section 210.12(B) of the 2005 NEC, but then is inaccurate in his paraphrase of the exception because of his choice of the word ""or"" to replace the word ""and"".In Article 250 the author calls attention to only two of the twenty signifcant changes from the 2002 to the 2005 NEC."
3,"If you're planning a thru hike, this is it","I have thru hiked the Muir Trail from north to south and found this book informative and containing some useful information. However, much of the info is of the common sense variety and could also easily be gleaned from the Internet. There is superfluous information on bear canisters, marmots and other hazards that any semi-experience hiker/backpacker would already know. The book is not marketed as being geared towards novices, but there's no doubt it would benefit a beginner and be less beneficial to a seasoned backpacker.The first section of the book consists solely of topographical maps, so the text portion is not especially lengthy. There are route descriptions of each facet of the trail, such as explaining the drop off points, elevation gains and topography of Thousand Island Lake in Mammoth to Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite. You could do a thru hike without this guide, but if you're the least bit apprehensive, then this would ease your worries."
3,Just o.k.,"This book really is not much more than a turn by turn description of the trail. In that regard, it provides little in the way of interesting prose to prepare you for the trip. So, basically, you pretty much have to carry this book with you to get much use out of it. Its informative sure, just not what I'd expect. Also, the maps in the book are black and white and much much much too small to actually read/use easily--buy the Tom Harrison maps for the JMT."
1,"Descriptive, but not useful","The first time I did the John Muir Trail I diligently bought this book like good little Internet researcher. I assumed, like everyone else, that this book would help me plan my trip. Not so. This book is like a play-by-play description of walking down the trail. It doesn't mention preparation, weather, seasons, services, rest stops, food drops, transportation...nothing. I quickly shelved this book and moved on to Ray Jardine's bible of the PCT. Although Ray's book often borders on insanity, it is full of trail wisdom. If Winnett's guide is the GEO Metro of trail books, Jardines is the Ferrari."
2,Toots is AMAZING - find a better collection though.,"There is no doubt Toots and the Maytals are Reggae greats, reggae pioneers, and deserve a lot more recognition than they have recieved.The songs on this collection are edited (shortened)horribly however. Most notable is the intro to, and the bridge of ""54-46 Was My Number"", both being completely ommited. Many of the edits eliminate the R&B and gospel influenced parts of the tracks that make Toots and Maytals unique.I would reccomend instead of this collection, you should try ""20th Century Masters, The Best of Toots & The Maytals, The Millenium Collection"" The edits are not present, and song choices are better (contains all the great songs the previous reviewer reccomended)."
3,Not as Good as OEM Battery,"The battery worked fine the for a short while but then did not have a very long period before it needed to be recharged. Did no seem to hold a full charge long. Although PC stated battery life was i.e. 50 minutes, it would not last 20 minutes before I got the message to connect my laptop to AC to prevent data loss and the battery was almost completely discharged."
5,PERFECTLY TRIMMED,THIS TRIMMER WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. EXCELLENT VALUE FOR A WELL MADE PRODUCT. KEEPS OUR HAIR TRIMMED WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY A BARBER EVERY WEEK.
4,Almost perfect,This is a pretty good machine would of been perfect if it was a bit sharper. Its sketchy at first also buying from the internet and not knowing iff its going to turn out good but was surprsingly surprised on how good it was.
4,Not so Sharp,i give it a four star review mainly kuz the blades aren't so sharp and i was looking for super sharp Outliner.I adjust them but still not sharp enough for the extra close line up i had to buy the T-outliner replacement blades for this machine and now i'm happy with this product other then that this outliner works well.
3,trimmer great but didn't include combs,"hubby loved this trimmer but there are no combs for trim adjustment! The only choice (additional) does not match the trimmer number, but I will order it anyway, as it might!"
3,Quality,"Seems like a quality product, solid and easy to use.Price was fair, a product that seems to be worth the money."
2,no way,hate these t-outliner sooo much better for me but to each his own we all cut differently ya know outliner 2 i use for corner edges lil boys edges or skin/bald fades so i still use them daily nice buy i just prefer t-outliners ! good luck and happy cuttin to all !
3,Not bad,"These clippers arent too bad except i had two problems with them. One was that the plug on the actual clipper didnt fit into the wall socket. One of the little prongs was too big. It looked like it needed to be filed down a little bit. Second was that you need to run the clippers in the same spot over and over and over again until the hair is finally gone. Unlike other clippers ive used in the past that you only run once or twice,these take more attempts in the same spot to get the hair off. Maybe its just me not using them right but those were the only two problems i had. Theyre kind of loud too but thats not a big deal."
4,"Great Clipper, a little difficult to clean hair from the internals","I use this clipper to cut my hair since I purchased it a few months ago. It chews through my relatively thick hair in no time, and appears to be very well made.My only criticism is that when I'm finished, a little hair can caught in the internal compartment (underneath the blade) which I think is normal for these types of hair clippers. No problem so far, but to remove the blade covers, you have to unscrew a couple machine screws - in doing so I stripped one, and had to take a trip to the hardware store to replace it.If it were a little easier to clean the internal compartment every so often I would have given this 5 stars. Don't let that keep you from buying this though, its great. Highly recommended."
5,Andis Trimmers,"Great product!!! this trimmer is very powerful. The seller shipped product very fast, and I saved around $30; what more can I WHAT A GREAT DEAL."
2,Broke during first use :(,"It did a good job, gave a very close cut but broke during first use. Turned it on again and blade is not moving at all, only noise and burnt smell..."
4,One of the best trimmer on the market,"a friend of mine recommended me this product,i was skeptic at first but once i`ve tried it well i was amazed.This is one of the best outliner/trimmer on the market.Andis did a really good job with this one.You should try it"
4,Not bad...,"Not bad shaved, cut pretty good for a dry shave... Good for line ups I don't really use it for whole facial shave, I use a razor for that..."
4,Great trimmer...,"I bought this trimmer for a couple reasons...1. Trim my beard with precession2. Find a trimmer that is better than typical cheap trimmersThis trimmer satisfied both needs and more.Yes, this trimmer does get hot.. and so far that is the only con I can think of besides its price being a bit higher than the normal beard trimmer/fader standard, but you get what you pay for. In my opinion it was worth the money.Not only did I buy the trimmer, but i bought the clippers separately with it. This turned out to be a great decision. Not only can I line my beard up, but now I can trim it to desired lengths, and it is SO much better than normal beard trimmers. I don't have to hassle with removing the clip to clean all the hair off..I also use this trimmer for my body as well... I use the clips that I bought to trim all areas of my body and it works great."
4,Great5 Service,"Received in excellent condition, works like a charm, and is a great product with a reasonable price."
3,NOT TO CLOSE OF A SHAVE!!,"I bought it cause they said it was great for dry close shaving and outline, but it is not as close as one would expect. I have a set of clippers and they shave almost as close as the Andis Outliner II Personal Trimmer. I would have same my $$$ if i knew it would be this way."
5,Excellent,"The album came right after Christmas, which was fine because I am a greedy bitch and it was a present for myself. Shipping was fast, item was in good condition, and the music is awesome. Love it. Thanks!"
3,Songs' value lost in production,"I love John Prine. He has the ability to make you laugh while you're crying. His songs are masterful blends of dark sorrow and light humor. Howerver, that magic is lost for me on most of this album. The production is way too thick for my attention to pierce to access songs like Blue Umbrella amd Mexican Home. These songs are better realized on ""John Prine Live"". Granpa Was a Carpenter and Please Don't Bury Me are staple Prine but in my opinion, best aquired in a collection like Prime Prine. Leave this one 'til last."
3,"Rehash, but classic stuff","John Prine is an American Classic who should be praised as much as Dylan. This album is a good 'sampler' of some earlier and later stuff.It's 'repackaging' at its best.My advice, get the 2-CD ""Greatest Hits"" from Amazon!"
3,80's style graphics are hard on adult eyes,"I purchased this for my 6 year old son, he loves it and isn't having a hard time with it at all... my teenager daughters who are confirmed gamers were given the task of showing their brother how to play this new purchase. I am happy to say I was out of the general area for most of the training session, the graphics are ok if you are 6 years old but I think anyone older who plays video games will be driven nuts by the graphics of this game. ( I only can write this because I was ready to bring out some cheese to go with the whines of my daughter's over the graphics!) If the need came to replace this game I would buy it again, just because my son really has fun with it."
3,Fun for the younger kids,"This product was for my older son, but it turns out the 8 yr. old liked it more, even though it was hard for him to maneuver. As stated in other reviews, the graphics are pretty bad - the older kids aren't going for it. One other thing - to get to another course, you first have to conquer the first course, which gets very boring. It would be more fun if you could use all the courses, whenever you wanted to. It is well made and even held my husband who is about 160 lbs."
4,Perfect for my battery charger,Heavy enough to handle a 15W current but small enough to tuck away. Perfect for those appliances that draw a little extra current.
1,not as described,"Under ""Technical Details"" and ""Product Description"" outdoor use is mentioned. I just received this cord and this is not the case. In fact, in 2 places-on the tag on the cord itself and the cardboard the cord was wrapped in-it states not to use in wet conditions. I was looking for a cord to leave outside."
5,"Extension cord, good price, very good quality","Two of these extension cords were purchased for repair shop use, needing extensions for power tools. The cable is good quality take a heavy beating stepps, drive across, ect, it holds and take all the abuses we give them every day. Ends are molded on them permanently, will hold until some sharp object may cut them and that is the end."
5,Best Music ever,I enjoy listening to his music anytime and anywhere and get compliments not crtisism. Anyone out there who needs to listen to very good music please purchase this cd
5,One of the 10 Best Albums of All Music Types,"Night Nurse is a beautiful, haunting compilation of ballads filled with Gregory Isaac's crystal voice. The songs are eerily provoking; stimulating the listener with tales of lost love gone bad and unfullfilled passion. While not heavy of social rhetoric, the album features spiritual attempts at self-redemption. Coupled with the ""Cool Ruler's"" unique lyrics, Night Nurse will quickly become a favorite in any musical collection."
5,The genius of Reggae,Gregory Isaacs..A genius on his own mind!! AWESOME album!! Awesome reggae hits!!
2,Secret Tweaker Pad peeps listen up,"IM a huge roots reggae as well as a sublime fan. I listened to the reviews and picked this up. They are correct when it comes to sayin this cat can sing...he can. And although it is an ok album (decent melodies) the cd's music is that high twanged casio keyboard sound. Its recorded at tough gong so the only thing I can think of was that it was his personal taste...in 1982 miami vice mode... do yourself a favor and buy Barrinton Levy's teach me some culture (1983) or Bunny Wailer's blachearted man (1976). put your shades on and dont check the time, cus it's 4:20."
5,Cool Ruler Strikes Hot,"If you are hesitating at all to buy this album, don't. It is an essential cornerpiece to any reggae collection. Night Nurse is one of those rare masterpieces that reaches out and twists your soul. Turn your lights down low now, now now, cause you ain't gonna linger no more."
5,This is a good CD! I'm very happy!,Hello!I'm from china and I'm Chinese.I'm twelve years old.I can speak a little English.This is a good CD!I like this choir very much!
2,Not the author's best,I just finished this book and I didn't care for it much. It does have a lot of historical detail however and the characters are likable. However it is missing something. The plot is loose and certain aspects of the story need tighten up a bit. It reads as if the author was trying to hurry to finish it after taking to long writing the beginning. I also thing she tried to hard at including the historical data. Some of the data add does not help the story but detracts from the pacing. I found it very easy for my attention to wander while reading this.
4,Very Enlightening Book!,"I really enjoyed this book. It provides some great insight into the world of the doctor/patient relationship. The information easily applies to today despite the fact that it was written about 20 years ago! This is a very biased, blunt book that goes straight at the jugular of modern medicine with logic being the driving force. This book solidified what I already felt...stay away from doctors unless you have a medical emergency! The book outlines some reasons to seek medical attention, when to avoid it and presents a great argument against vaccinations. I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs encouraged on their path against the grain or for anyone teetering on the fence!"
5,5 stars!,Ordering 10 books to give to my mama- friends. Every one must have one. Grateful to the author for his courage and writing this book. Thank you for your kindness and care for me to make healthy choices for my children.
5,Best Medical Guide,First time I took it just for curiosity from a health store. It's been so helpful everytime I neefef medical advice.
3,Caution: Get a second opinion!,"There are many great aspects to this book: a fever is necessary, avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor. However, when it comes to vaccines, do your homework! I found the author to be biased against vaccines. From another source, I saw a graph of the *actual data* of incidence of measles before and after the measles vaccine was introduced, sure looks to me like the vaccine had a major effect! Nothing in life is without some risk, getting a vaccine, not getting a vaccine. Research for yourself, from unbiased sources and actual data, the side effects of vaccines and the potential complications of ""common"" diseases. Measles can make a child deaf or worse. My children have some vaccines and not others; It's up to you to decide which risk you will take. Buy the book, but get a second opinion about vaccines."
2,A bit outdated.,"I think the book was probibly great in 1984 when it was published. I was a bit disappointed about how outdated it was;it suggested giving a teaspoon of Whiskey for fever to an infant. I wish that the publication date was available to view before purchasing the book and if it was, to make it easier to find.Times sure have changed in the last 23 years. The concepts are good but I think Dr. Mendelsohn needs to update the book and re-release it."
2,"Some Good Advice But Pretty Quacky, Too","While I'm sure this doctor meant well, it's obvious he had an axe to grind with the traditional medical community, and that comes through in the book. He gives some advice that I felt was just wrong like to give babies whiskey for certain ailments! He had a few good tips in there but they have to be weighed against his obvious bias. I wouldn't recommend this book to new parents."
2,too antagonistic,"The title says it all. This book is NOT good for anyone who actually respects their doc, which is most of us. Go for something less hostile and more respectful."
1,Give your kids Brandy and Whiskey....,"YEAH, THAT sounds like GREAT ADVICE. I am so sorry I bought this book. Into the trash it goooooeeeessss."
5,Grandmother loves this book,"Three children, 4 GC later, this book is still timely. I give it for Baby gifts. Two GC reared by this book are never sick. The two reared by the pediatrian are always sick, always on some kind of medication. Unfortunately, the medical community in the USA has a whole lot to learn about keeping the body healthy."
3,"Essex part two, Beam part three","At last, I found this book! For years, I thought my collection of gay, black writing would just not be complete without this book. Because it was from an independent press, I thought the book would be small in size and older than ""Brother to Brother""; the opposite is true.Though this book focuses on the HIV pandemic, black and gay issues come up consistently. Similar to ""Brother to Brother"" where HIV matters come up, though it's not an HIV-focused book. In short, if you read one, you read the other. Still, in no way am I saying don't collect both. I didn't care for this way this book began with stream-of-consciousness letters. The letters in ""Brother"" were more precise and appeared in the middle of the text.I don't regret finding or owning this. Still, it is similar to much of what was produced by gay, black authors in the 1990s."
5,Excellent! Featuring a Female Trumpet Player/Vocalist,"This album is a wonderful collection of original smooth jazz compositions. It is unusual and original to see a woman play the trumpet as well as sing. Her style is smooth, and her trumpet playing is like ""silk"" and is worth listening to! My favorite tracks are #12 - Mr. Midnight (sultry ballad featuring her vocals and muted trumpet - a real ""romancer""!);#9 - Jungle Square (an upbeat percussive track with a latin feel); and #5 - Rhythmic Passion -- as the title may suggest, a nice way to set the mood for a more ""intimate rendez vous"" . . ."
5,Love it : )),"Wonderfully smooth and completely relaxing, thanks Jeannie : )I almost missed this one and will NEVER take it off the iPod, stress cannot survive your magic here : )"
5,WORLD FUSION WITH A SIDE OF CHICAGO JAZZ/BLUES,"Great metheny-esque (late 70s-80s) influenced world fusion. The Jeannie Tanner Ensemble combines world-beat jazz, fusion,blues,and newage to get it's musical message to the masses! Great trumpet work in the style of Art Farmer (before he played flugle horn). She also sings! This is a must for new music fans."
4,My 5 year old son loved it!,My five year old son loves Power Rangers and he was thrilled with this movie. I would recommend it for purchase.
2,Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts,"I was disappointed with the variety pack and should have ordered the honey roasted or dry roasted macs. The chocolate covered macs have so much chocolate that I could not taste the macs, the kona flavored ones were bitter, and the onion and garlic ones were too salty. I love the flavor of macadamia nuts and was disappointed that it was overwhelmed by low quality ingredients. Definitely not worth the price!"
3,FLASH FIRE,"YUP-this delivers. Fast and to the point. Good for a quick read before bed, or a long afternoon..."
3,Not worth the price,"Yes this dispenser works well, however sticky things will make the sliding top stick (shocker, I know), and then the thumb lever which is made of thin metal will easily bend. Overpriced for what it is, a glass jar with a metal lid, not to mention shipping. Come on, these must cost about one dollar to make in China. Concept is great, should be less expensive or better made, possibly both."
4,Excessive shipping charges,The product was sent in a timely manner. A wounderful procuct. I thought the shipping charges were a little excessive.
4,Love it,I was a little skeptical when I first bought this product but couldn't be happier with it now. It works perfectly for my honey which is why I bought it. I absolutely love it.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the silver coating on the outside started to peel off the first time I opened the dispenser. To me this is cosmetic and doesn't affect the usefullness of the product.
2,bad gasket,"The syrup container looks beautiful on the table - I love the shape. The mechanism works well but the gasket does not fit (too small), so that the honey runs around the inside lid threads and drips down the side. Since the whole point is to have a mess-free way to dispense honey, it's a fatal flaw."
3,It drips,"I like the idea of having honey inside this type of jar, but after a couple uses, it stared to drip and I have to constantly wash the jar."
3,syrup dispenser,OK but leaks - drips more than I like - about he right size - that said is probably better than most alternitives i have seen.
3,Leaks.,"I was hoping to be like the other reviewers that stated theirs did not leak. Well, I'm not. This does leak but I figured out that it leaks only when tipped up higher than half way and it only leaks in the front. So I'll have to remember that every time I pour from it. Annoying? yes. Functional? Yes. I appreciate the solid parts. With that gasket there I'm not sure why it leaks. I'm using it for maple syrup, not honey (which is thicker). If anyone ever finds a syrup dispenser that specifically doesn't leak when using pure maple syrup, let me know!"
2,Leaky!!,"I bought this with our impending move to Germany in mind. I opened it up this morning with anticipation, and filled it up with homemade syrup. I was dismayed to see that it leaks! And very badly! I cleaned it up twice, but it looks like syrup is still migrating out through the top even when sitting upright on the counter. And, yes, the lid is on very tight. I am disappointed!"
3,Depends on how you like your condiments,"After quite a long search for a syrup container of decent size and durable materials, I settled on this one.And it's great, as long as you prefer cold syrup or honey.The trouble is, my family prefers hot syrup, and we make our own. Since the metal lid has to be removed to microwave the syrup, or to pour in boiling hot fresh syrup, once that glass jar is hot, it is painful to hold while putting the lid back on.Other than that, it's fine. But, we prefer the Tupperware 16oz Cream Syrup Mini Pitcher."
2,Syrup drips,"This was our second syrup dispenser in quest for one that does not drip. On first time out, today, it leaked from all around the top and dripped from the pourer. Do not recommend for syrup."
5,MY AUNT LIKES THESE STORIES,"Most of these stories are love stories. Ohhhh, gross! But I'm visiting my aunt and forgot my books. She let me read two she says are okay for kids my age.I liked the story about the SIXTIES and the one about the gingerbread man. It was scary. I like scary stories.I like computers too.Thanks - Andrew"
3,Nice book since my Lhasa Apso got mated to a mixed breed...,"Nice book since my Lhasa Apso got mated to a mixed breed and she is about to give birth. But I think some of the info is general, like in training. Excluding the part dedicated to mixed breeds, I think the book can also be called Guide to owning a dog."
4,Both Sahg I and II - worth getting if you love early Sabbath!,"I highly recommend both Sahg I and Sahg II if you love early Sabbath. I also highly recommend Graveyard's self-titled album and all three of Witchcraft's albums. Riff-heavy music, Ozzy-sounding vocalists, but all three bands add their own unique sounds to the Sabbath sound. If you want something that rocks in a similar vein, but goes to newer territory, check out both albums by Witch (not to be confused with Witchcraft). They are both excellent albums."
2,,"Not the most original thing out there, Sahg's music consists of playing a somewhat updated version of Black Sabbath with some ferocity thrown in. But where bands like Electric Wizard have succeeded, this is where Sahg's music fails. It simply doesn't grab your attention. Sure, the standard and in-your-face nature of the compositions here might win fans of the old-school doom bands, but doom bands- being limited to the options they have-often struggle to create something that will expand an already limited sub-genre. Sahg does create at times some good moments in their music, but the rest of the music is simply stuff we've heard before. Doom fans will most likely devour this."
5,Marathon Trilogy,"Guy, Guys, Guys!These games are awesome but Bungie released the source code so you can download it1!(...)Don't waste your money on a free game!"
1,Great show over priced set,I have found similar sets for a fraction than what's being asked for here. Unfortunately I was unable to get my hands on a set before it went flying off the shelves so I came looking for it here at Amazon. Here I find the only set available is outrageously over priced so much so that when divided by three the average price for each season is well over what each season actually costs. Nice job seller!
4,Good voice. Nice music.,"I've never been a totally huge fan of Corey Harts, but all the music I've had of his in the past has been on cassette and I thought it would be nice to have my favourite songs of his on CD. On here is one of the best and most beautiful songs ever; Never Surrender. It's fantastic. There's also Sunglasses At Night (probably one of the songs he's known best for). His voice is a bit Bryan Adams-ish but he's not quite on the same par. Nevertheless, this is an excellent cd with a lot of older music that will bring back memories from the 80's."
2,Not the Best,"Road depiction is very vague. Difficult to read. Somewhat useable with AAA maps. For the best maps see the series by Benchmark Maps. I have used their maps in New Mexico, California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona. Unfortunately, they do not have many states. I use the Delorme ""Utah"" with my AAA maps."
4,Little known facts about a remarkable man,"I found this video both very entertaining and very educational, I learned bits and pieces about Paul Robeson as I was growing up, and this portrayal was both very complementary and accessable. James Earl Jones is a remarkable actor and portrays himself as a credible Paul Robeson. After seeing this video, I feel I have a better understanding of the man that he was and the barriers that he had to overcome in order to just be. He was a man of many deep principles and some of these led to his social undoing."
3,Too long with not enough to say...,"While I am certain that this book's author knows what he's talking about when it comes to African history, I still found a lot missing from this book. Every page seems to say the same basic statement (just with different words): Africa was told it had to deny its history if it wanted to be ""civilized."" I certainly agree with this statement, but I didn't have to see it written on virtually EVERY page. I think that an account of the African people and their personal struggles would have been a much better read. C+"
1,Hard to find the gold dust,I echo many of the comments in the above 3 star reviews but wish to add that this is one of the most poorly written books I have forced my way through in many years. Save your money and buy one of the many other good and well-written books on Africa.
5,What A Rich Sound!,"Pierlot is certainly recognized as master hautboist of our day. Known as one who turned French oboe playing in a new direction, he demonstrates this new French style with his clear tone and fast vibrato.This is simply great oboe concertos from top composers (Marcello, Haendel, Telemann, Albinoni and Cimarosa), some originally composed for oboe/lyre, but seems here two oboes do the task with Maurice Bourgue ably providing the second. I say seems, as the liner notes are French and thus unable to translate.This CD translates itself into absolute gorgeous with three different Chamber Orchestras providing the backup. This is a winner!"
3,Strawberry's Towel wasn't berry great,"I was suprised to see my strawberry shortcake towel wasn't even big ebough to wrap around myself. Verry cute though, better for drying hands than body. Good sized washcloth included as well."
2,Very disappointing,"I ordered these towels as Christmas gifts for my two girls; not only are the towels tiny, certainly not bath towel size or anywhere near, but the quality was very poor and within a few days they started to fray. My girls still love them because they are Strawberry Shortcake but for this price I think the standard of quality is pathetic."
1,Shrinks!,One wash and this towel shrunk so small a baby couldn't even dry off with it. Really not worth the purchase.
1,i hated it so much.,I hate this toy so much! Hurricane [stinks]. And roseys a fat loser. Everybody thinks he's cool. He 's a stinkin super hero. they should put him in a mental hospital. and rosey should go to jenny craig. In my conclussion i think he [stinks]. jake
2,Shop some more,"If you're a large man and get excited when you see ""extra large"", just settle down. XL for whom? They went back. And, as always with Amazon, we paid the return freight. But from this vendor, we also had to pay incoming freight, so two freight charges + no gloves = $14.58. FOR NOTHING!"
3,danny gatton not on a tele,About as good a recording you will get from the house board and the liner notes indicate most fans should forgive this shortfall.Gatton's playing is great though he doesn't play a telecaster on this particular night? Principatos playing is smooth but often washed in effects. (common 80's blues sound). Enjoyable as a reference for Danny's playing but won't make it into any of my playlists.
4,"Relevant, interesting and easy to follow","""The Quiet Warrior"" was loaned to me by my college room-mate who said ""I couldn't put it down"" and she was right as I couldn't either. Being the daughter of a WWII Pacific vet and living still in a world 'at war', I found the story relevant, interesting and easy to follow. For Christmas I gave a copy to both my father and my son and now they ""can't put it down"". Like many of the ""Greatest Generation"", my father didn't talk of his service or of his sacrifices or of what he saw, but this book has opened a new communication between us three, a chance to talk about the war, the military, national security, service to one's country, both then and now. I recommend it without hesitation. DG"
5,My tattoo is the Quiet Warrior: the 6 headed trident of the Navy Ship I met in Barcelona,"Interesting.. I was living in Barcelona for a few years, and a group of Navy guys came into a bar there... One of the little chumps wanted to beat me up, and he kept saying ""don't u know who I am?""I kept thinking, ""he is not too quiet"", and I told his boss, my dad retired from the Navy. Either way.. he would have lost.when they got kicked out of the place, his ""boss"" ...(who said before that he would not be able to hit me unless he allowed him too) gave us a coin..DD-963... Quiet Warrior..I figured it was Gods way of telling me to shut up, as I fought a few dozen battles with near a hundred thieves and silly people in barcelona...So, I put the tattoo... [...]of the coin, on my right hand near my thumb, and index finger, to remind me, what God was saying, ""shut up, warrior!""obviously, I am still learning..and now, i find Jewell.. (did not know she was still alive)made a song..[...]cool.."
4,"Fair biography, a bit cold","I was always interested in WWII in Pacific, and especially fascinating person for me was Admiral Raymond Spruance. He was almost a mystical figure, cold-blooded, closed genius. This book is first that gave me a bit more light to this person, and picture is a bit less fascinating.Anyway, this book leaves almost no open questions. Spruance was as he was, nothnig more, nothnig less, and Buell doesn't intend to change this."
5,Ray Spruance found to be a great human,"I am not quiet half way though the first reading of this great novel about the late great Admiral Raymond Ames Spruance. I have found myself unable to put it down in my leisure moments even to the point of missing ""must see TV."" I've found that I share a great many similarities with the Admiral. Thomas Buell does and outstanding job of bringing this larger than life man down to an understandable, intimate, personal, human level. His convictions, ambitions, fears, personal failures are all laid bare by the authors pen. Indeed I firmly believe that there is a little bit of Ray Spruance in all of us."
3,Interesting,It was not really what I was expecting. I love Desaderata but most of the work here does not carry the same impact. Still is an interesting read.
3,No News Is Good News,"This could potentially be a *5* star review but I purchased these for use by others during presentations at an annual conference. This is the kind of thing I hear about if there are any problems and I got no negative feedback, so I feel comfortable giving this 3 stars."
2,Frustrating,"For some reason, even though the unit is RC not IR, the Easy Presenter seems to have a poor response. When you're in the middle of a presentation and the slides don't advance without moving around to get into position can be frustrating. I've seen better."
3,Death and Badminton,"""The Experimental Avant Garde Series Vol 19"" series is for serious film buffs only. The DVD contains five shorts, and most of them are interesting curiosities.The short ""The Dove"" (aka, Death Plays Badminton), a spoof of Ignmar Bergman's films, is really, really funny. If you've ever earnestly watched a Bergman film and thought, ""God it was brilliant, but I am sort of glad its over,"" then check out ""The Dove."" That short alone is worth the price of the whole disc."
5,"After Por Amor, this is the absolute greatest!!!!","Nothing ever compares to the original set of anything but in my opinion, this set of Menudos was the best. Charlie Masso, Ricky Martin, Robby Rosa, Ray Acevedo and Roy Rosello were my most favorite of the Menudo quintets. When my sister bought for me the ""Ayer y Hoy"" album (Christmas 1985) I knew from the first time that I listened to it that it was the greatest of them all. How can you beat ""Viva, Bravo"", ""Acercate"", La Fiesta Va Empezar"" and ""Panuelo Blanco Americano"".....a must for any Menudo collection."
3,tip,make shure you have the thermastat knob all the way cold before you remove the radio from the dash.if yo dont youll break a cheap plastic bracket and will not be abel to reatach the linkage.
1,Purchased for my 1998 zx2,"DID NOT CONNECT TO MY ESCORT AT ALL.Looks really nice, but the connectors did not match up at all. The wires were misplaced and the connectors were incorrect to the factory harness. Pissed."
5,Holds more pads than you think...,We bought this to store shoulder pads for a youth football program. We were able to store 124 sets of pads on it ranging from youth XS to youth XXL. We will definitely be ordering another one. Seems to be very sturdy.
5,red rock country,This book gives a good over view of Sedona and some history of the area. It explains the vortexes and the chakra's of Sedona.
4,Streiker's Bride,"This is a great book. Cute love story and fun characters. It was a quick read, I read it in an afternoon. The love scenes are clean and sweet so I would rate it PG. It makes you think, at least it did me. How would I react to this situation?"
1,"Give your money for donation, don't but this product","A New Yorker, suffering from Hurricane Sandy and thereafter the gas shortage, I purchased this funnel, and to my disappointment, it does not produce a tight seal, and it will leak.I am surfing right now to look for another funnel to replace exactly this."
3,It's just a funnel,"I got this for my boyfriend, and he said it's adequate. Wish it came with radiator plug or oil cap pieces that fit it (didn't come with them at all)."
1,A little too cozy,"I would have to put this book in the ""cozy"" mystery category. It was just a little too cozy for me and way to touchy feely. It was the first Peter Bartholomew mystery I read and will most likely be the last."
4,Pretty Well Done,"If you have played Warcraft, Lords of Everquest, or War of the Ring, then this game is along the same lines. A RTS game that involves resource collection and leveling up tech trees to go out and complete differant missions connected in a pretty interesting storyline. I was actually having some problems getting by certain levels on normal difficulty. I found that there were no cheat codes to be found for this game. Luckily it does allow you to adjust the difficulty. What makes this game unique from the others I have listed is the ability to take the action underground. That in itself makes it worth buying. Otherwise, it is pretty much like the others."
3,Armies of Exigo,"Armies of Exigo is a strategy war game, very similar to Warcraft 2 & 1, if your a fan of the old school strategy games like me, you'll love this game. Your troops are abit hard to control, due to the controls, but otherwise this is a great game.""Summary"" I gave this one a 4 on the fun factor, a close 5. But a 3 on the quality, not of the game, but of the condition the box was in when I recieved it, the box was smashed & buckled inwards."
2,Who did this crummy multi-player!!!,This game is fun... But the multiplayer is terrible! It took me almost an hour to get though there crummy 'registration' thing just so I could get online and play... That is if there was anyone to play. There never seems to be anyone online... LAME!
1,Different than I expected from its demo,"I really do not like the world of warcraft spell setups in some games and as a Christian I didnt like the story in the game and dealing with demons and stuff like that. I dont think it is wise playing with stuff like that, and after reading about it and see for myself what was in the game more than the demo I tore the game up. If your a person who likes fantasy rts games stick with Lord of the rings battle for middle earth or if you just like rts games in general keep with age of empires 3, empire earth, and other games. This is a religious review of my personal ideas on playing games and I wished i had read more about the games story line and setup before just seeing the eye candy. Some games I can stand, but some just bother me in this department."
4,Thanks Jerry!,"If you are looking for brand-new material that will simply amaze you, go to the next review. (Try Brian Regan, he is incredible.)If you want a recording of wonderful comedy you've heard before, try this CD. I belong to the second group. I've heard Seinfeld's bits before. I watched his show every week. Most of this material is not new. And yet... I don't use the word ""classic"" too often, but this CD sums up Jerry's best stuff. You can tell you're in for a funny bit when the audience laughs at the setup lines (""Why is McDonald's still couting?"").Not much question here. If you like the show and the old standup, this one is worth owning. Otherwise buy Brian Regan's CD and see him live next time through for a new experience!"
3,Decent Retrospect,"Well, here is a 70+ minute rehash of the material Seinfeld had been running his career on for about ten years. None is actually new, you probably heard a lot of it from his sitcom or in his book, but he delivers it freshly enough.If you like this type of humor, you might want to check out one of the comedians that originated this stuff: George Carlin. I swear, some of Seinfeld's bits sound lifted off of 1970's/early 80's Carlin albums (when the guy was more laid back and observational). Listen to ""Class Clown"", ""On The Road"" or ""Place for my Stuff""."
4,Old jokes never die,"This is a CD that any Seinfeld fan should pay $15 dollars for. You will find yourself listening to it, putting it away, then listening to it again after a few weeks. Jerry's acting abilities are wonderful - he puts a lot of drama into his jokes. I recommend this CD to all Seinfeld die-hards."
1,"Jerry takes the title literally, there's nothing new here",This album isn't that good. Most of the jokes are exactly the same as in the introductions of the Seinfeld show episodes some are just introduced or padded out a bit more. Unlike Seinfeld episodes the stand up material isn't hilarious each time you watch it. It's worth listening to once but I wouldn't bother paying money to own your own copy.I would have liked to have heard some original stuff but was extremely disappointed.Buy the TV show episodes on DVD or something for superb Seinfeld humour but you won't find a classic comedy album here. There are much better stand up comedy albums by other artists.
1,Worth checking out,"Jerry is one of history's great stand up comedians, no doubt. That is why this is worth listening to. Be aware that yes, there is a lot of material on here that is old. Basically stuff you might have seen Jerry perform on an HBO special back in like 1982. I think since he regrettably never released a stand up record before he decided to use a lot of this to preserve it on a CD. That in conjunction with the fact that he might not have had that much new material. I wish he had vintage stuff of him recorded from small comedy clubs back in the 80s. I always prefer on a comedy record that it is performed in a small club as opposed to a huge arena or hall. You definitely lose all of the intimacy that I think makes for the best stand up comedy experience. All in all since this is Jerry's one and only comedy record it is certainly worth checking out, let's face it a mediocre Jerry output is better than a lot of comedians best stuff."
5,Hello Newman,"This is an excellent CD, all the parts are very funny, and it is a cd that you can listen to over and over and its still funny, most of the material is old, but still very funny. So , i recommend buy it,the hallowen bit is the best.......don't kill indepedent George!"
1,Old Stuff From Seinfield Loses Its Humor,This stuff on this cd is old...used to be funny but it has lost the edge because it is overplayed and over performed. Jerry had a great career but this cd is an hour of boredom.
4,A Teen's Point of View,"This is an interesting book about what the future could bring. It is also a good read. Not as good as Shearer's Bootleg, but still."
3,okay,I like Wilton products but I'm not thrilled by these cups. Some of them crinkle when I pour the batter in them & then I have a funny looking cupcake when baked. I can not sell that or present that cupcake. So I have to put the batter in another cup & throw the messed up one away. Waste of $$. Also the colors fade while baking.
1,absolute waste of money,"this DVD appears to have been made by some local(Camden area) musicians. It is punctuated by their tribute songs to Ms. Winehouse. Put simply the songs are terrible and there are only three images of Amy in the entire 45 min. video, which are constantly recycled. I learned nothing new about the artist (and I've only seen Amy Winehouse: the girl done good).please, do not waste your money or time."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,"Even the BIGGEST Amy Winehouse fan should keep their money. This dvd is terrible!! There are ONLY comments and opionions from her fans. No professional, investigative stuff. The only video of Amy on here is when she is seen getting out of a car.....same footage over and over again. Nothing new. I was disappointed, and I sure wouldn't want you to be!!"
1,NOT A DVI-I CABLE!,"If you're looking for a DVI-I cable, DO NOT buy this product! As a bonus, not only did I receive a DVI-D cable (which lacks the full set of pins, which I need), the cable and the bag it came in had ""HDMI Cable"" printed on them. Epic Fail.Seriously, don't buy this!"
2,Do not use this for PC or Mac,The web page says it is compatible with PC and Mac. Not true! I couldnt plug it to my Dell LCD monitor. Stay away from DVI-I type and do not believe what the web page says. Use DVI-D instead.
3,"Nice idea, but","This is a nice idea. But it apparently doesn't always work.For two weeks, we've been attempting to upload small music files from a desktop computer to a RazorV3 phone with this cord and software --- without luck. That's despite three calls to date to the Moto technicians.Motorola software updates didn't work. Updating software for the Microsoft Windows XP UBS drivers didn't work. Cutting the size of the Mp3 files to be transferred didn't work. An error message consistently reads, ""Cannot transfer file....""We bought this gizmo so as to avoid the expense and danger of connecting a kid's cell phone to the internet. So far, it's a disappointment--though the Moto tech people have been fast, gracious, and as helpful as they can be. Maybe they'll get it straightened out, yet."
3,Why is a mouse required?,"I am fine with the gameplay and graphics. What I find unacceptable is the fact that menus must be navigated with the mouse, and cannot be navigated with a joypad. What makes it more bewildering is that this was ported from a console game, where it is expected that the joypad is the only mode of input. Even to dismiss dialogs between quarters you must use the mouse or keyboard. I can't start a game, kick back on my beanbag and play, I need to sit at my desk so I can keep the mouse within reach. If I had known this before I bought the game, I would have bought the PS2 version."
1,This game is horrable. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!,"This game sucks. However, if you like cheating opponents it is the game for you. It is impossible to win. The shooting and passing is defective. Do yourself a favour and do not buy this game. You will most likely buy a game controller to go a long whith it and then it will be an even bigger waste of money."
4,Gain insight *before* you go!,"Culture Shock Cuba really did it for me. Any imaginable situation you get yourself in while visiting Cuba is mentioned. Coming from a Northern European culture there was just a lot for me to understand, if I didn't want to behave like a total weirdo. It is an easy and fun to read book I absolutely recommend."
1,Sad Disappointment,"I am a big Susan Mallery fan, especially her longer novels. So when I checked the page count for this one I was looking forward to it. I got the book and was sadly disappointed. This is one of Mallery's older and not so wonderful skinny Harlequin books that has been republished and then the publisher threw in a bonus book by a completely different author. This disappointment could be nullified if the book were better, but sadly it is not. The plot line is boring, the writing is not up to her normal standard and the characters lack their normal spark. Do not let the cover and description fool you. I would hate for you to be disappointed too. Looking forward to the next BRAND NEW all hers book....""Already Home"" in May."
4,"Good gritty, evocative rock n' roll","The first time I heard this album it was playing in a bar's jukebox and I spent the next few days trying to find it. They're the kinds of songs that once you hear them, they will always kind of be there on the tip of your mind. The individual songs are not as memorable as the overall feel of the album.For comparison I would suggest Grant Lee Buffalo's Mighty Joe Moon; an acoustic sound with low, dark vocals. I suggest Track 6 'Ride the Raincloud' as the best of the album. Emotionally I would describe it as cold weather music, cuts right through you."
1,ca.sa Stockholm,"The picture is nice but the quality of the dvd is really lousy.Grainy,unclear picture,faded colours and bad dubbing.Don't buy this one unless you're a very stong fan ofVittorio De Sica."
5,WE HELP MOMMY,I had these books when I was a child and bought them for my own children who are now grown. I've lost them in moving over the years and I'm buying them again for my own grandchildren to grow up with and love too.
5,Adorable book,"Both my 4 year old boy and 2 year old girl LOVE this book. It is really sad that my family has to read books from the 50s to find examples of a loving caring family working together in their God given roles. This book does not have any religious themes, but does show children being caring and respectful to their mother and father. Also it shows parents being thankful and greatful that they have such well behaved and helpful kids. All in all if we could put 21st century convenances together with this book's examples of good old common since and work ethic this world would be perfect!Chilren enjoy reading this book because of the love and thankfulness that this book pours out on the sweet respectful and helpful chilren in it's pages. It also teaches children simple ways to fulfill their role in the family. Parents get a lesson in child training and how important it is to be positive, calm, and loving in dealing with our little preschoolers."
5,Absolutely amazing!,"This mix is one of the best I have ever heard, and was such a relief from all the electro-house that has seemed to dominate many mixes recently. The second cd has hands down the most beautiful ending I have ever heard on any mix compilation. While listening to tracks 10,11,and 12 you will wish it could go on forever. Thank you Nick Warren for giving us this masterpiece."
5,kick arse,"I've been a trance addicted since the early 90's. I first heard of Nick Warren by GU 008 Brazil and loved it. When I heard GU 011 Budapest I was hooked. I followed Nick through his Renaisannence era, it was good. But still didn't have the luster of ""mara.One(hamel remix) GU011. Until now, this cd hits every note and chord that keeps your head bobbing and your body dancing over and over again. Thanks Nick for bringing some of the classics back to the main stream. For with out these classics such as hardfloors"" acperience 1"" where would we be?????"
2,A handful of good tracks with mediocre mixing.,"I don't know why this gets rave reviews - yes there are a few strong songs, but the rest are lacking and the whole mix is not very adventurous. Danny Howells' GU set is far better.The good tracks on disc 1: Don't forget me (Way Out West always rocks), Vapour Trails (Quite a good track, possibly one ofthe best in the past year). That's it! Just 2.The good tracks on disc 2: Come to Me, Synthetic Symphony, Acperience1, Maleta, Flame. Only 5 good tracks.The general problem w/this set is that it doesn't move you much aside from the above 7 tracks. And those 7 tracks, which are quite melancholy will not stay in your head long like a good set does. Indeed, almost all of the other tracks are dreary and depressing too. Not too mention that the mixing is about as exotic as the iTunes crossfade playback. Sorry I just cannot get excited over this set. Compare it to Danny Howells' first set, Miami, and you'll feel even more Shanghaied by Nick Warren."
2,If only the contents were as good as its packaging,I found this to be much more 'techy' than progressive. And that for me was very disappointing. I have given this 2 stars simply because I enjoyed about 1/3 of the tracks. It is definitely not one of the best GU's ever. I'd probably give this away if it was not for the inner sleeve.
5,Wild flowers of the worldWild flowers of the world - illustrated,"One of the best, most comprehensive book on wildflowers I've ever seen. The illustrations are overpowering. This is a terrific resource book for artists wanting a realistic portrayal. A ""must buy"" and definate plus to a resource library."
3,A great bday gift for the mechanic in your life.,"I bought this gift for my husband for his birthday and he's been totally engrossed in it. He originally saw it in Road and Track and was intrigued because he's big into formula 1 and ferraris. He hopes to work on them someday. Point is, it's a great gift if you've got a mechanic or ferrari enthusiast in your life."
2,Disappointed,"For anyone who has read the classic Pomeroy series 'Grand Prix Cars', this book will be a disappointment. Pomeroy set the standard by describing what made each particular winning car successful. Whether it be dual the overhead camshaft engine in the 1912 Peugot or the extremely light ladder frame and nitro-benzene powered engine of the 1934 Mercedes. Each of these chapters gave the reader a thorough understanding of what secret breakthrough made the car quickest.None of that is in this book. Systems described in detail are those that are the norm for F1 design. There are several areas where Wright states explicitly that he isn't allowed to describe the unique 'secret' aspects of the Ferrari that set it above its competition. Without that insight, this is nothing more than a pretty photo album."
4,A Firm Foundation,Sdorow's textbook is indeed an excellent resource for the college level student beginning studies in psychology. The chapters are well organized and structured----combining a perfect balance between the theoretical and practical. Sdorow also writes this text in such a way as to aid the novice reader in the process of choosing the particular field/school of psychology which best befits them. Definitely a firm foundation for those who have decided to learn more about psychology and perhaps pursue a career in it.
3,Same Book/ Different title,I had already read this book. It is a British retitle of the Footprints of God in America. The book was in good condition. Seller was good and speedy.
3,Not bad,"the book is a much slower start than other Isles books I've read. Nothing like most of the murder mysteries he has written, but by the time I was 1/4 of the way through I was hooked. Just about done and it's keeping me going to to end!"
2,lasted for two years before leaking at the seams,"If this was a more expensive product I'd give it 1-star. However, it did last us two years before it became un-useable. Probably used a total of 60 times during that period. If you're looking for something cheap that won't be used very much, then this might work. Otherwise don't bother."
2,"Some gems, but over-complicated by ""academic"" jargon","This book is not bad per se. It covers useful points such as knowing yourself to lead, differentiating between your natural predispositions and your projected self, DISC model to help understand your predispositions, a small smattering of useful stories to illustrate the complexities in personality and behaviour (more would've been great) etc.Unfortunately, it is shrouded in academia speak so it's almost like reading a university text book or academic journals. A simplified version of this book - while it may seem ""dumbed down"" to academics - will actually be much more practical and useful.What I ended with up after reading this book, is a lot of definitions, terms, jargon, but found very little that is practical in real life. Pity, it could've been better. I'm surprised Ken didn't make use of his writing techniques from ""Who Moved My Cheese?"", which is so much more practical."
2,Interesting but a difficult read,"I schlogged through the first 35 pages and found this book a difficult read. It is like reading a college psych book. The author throws out difficult to understand terms and concepts which he too briefly defines. I am reading further, but I cannot give this book to the person I purchased it for because he would never get past the first 20 pages."
4,Not silent as advertised...,"The whistle is advertised as silent to the human ear, but it isn't. It isn't loud or piercing, and the dogs do respond to it quickly. And that's what I bought it for. It is adjusted by twisting it, which is easy."
1,Dog whistle blows,"This whistle is not a ""silent"" whistle. You can hear the whistle, I have tried to adjust it but it still makes noise. There are few directions on how to adjust or use the whistle. I would not buy one again. I have had it for about a month and it has been laying in a drawer most of that time. The shipping was fast."
1,it ain't an ultrasonic whistle,No matter where you put the adjuster it doesn't even come close to a frequency that is inaudible to humans.I threw it in the trash.
1,whistle DID NOT WORK-waste of money,Threw it away....tried to adjust it numerous times ...never worked. I can use use my fingers and whistle louder. It was very silent.....nothing.
3,LOOK AROUND TO FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR~,"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? AND LOOKING TO ACCOMPLISH?? THAT IS THE FIRST QUESTION YOU MUST ASK YOURSELF. ARE YOU LOOKING TO REPLACE YOUR VOICE SO THAT THE DOGS CAN HEAR YOU BETTER? OR ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A SILENT WHISTLE SO YOU WONT BOTHER PUBLIC, BUT DOGS CAN STILL HEAT IT ??? MOST ""SILENT"" DOG WHISLTES ARE LOUD AND WE CAN HEAR THEM TO OUR BRAINS~!!!! HOWEVER, THIS IS ONE FOR YOU IF YOU WANT THE WHISTLE TO DO THE JOB INSTEAD OF YOUR THROAT. IF YOU WANT A QUIET WHISLE, GO LOOK SOME MORE. THERE ARE FEW THAT MAKES THEM, BUT THEY ARE OUT THERE. LOOK FOR MADE IN UK, OR GERMANY, OR JAPAN PRODUCT. THEY ARE AS INDEED THE BEST IN THE WORLD."
1,"Very bad,","I was almost going to keep for my son to play tools with. These are not any close to advanced tools. Totally opposite! The machining of the wrench heads where all in different areas, making me think that once I turned it, it would break. Wrenchs are thinner in positions were they should be thicker. You don't get what you pay for, IT IS A JOKE! Thank you, China!"
1,Awful tasting!,"Very disappointing- I usually LOVE coconut haystacks, but these were waxy cheap tasting chocolate with not enough coconut to call themselves 'haystacks'. Yuck. Save your money and just buy a Mounds bar..."
3,"Freddie Hart""C D""","Music was as I remembered as a young girl.However,CD,bought as new,music must have been ""transferred with""skip.""Should have been advertised as not perfect."
4,Overall excellent,"This product was as advertised. It arrived in a timely fashion, and in perfect condition. Instructions were easy to follow and assembly uncomplicated. It is exactly the aid to a disabled person that we had hoped for. Not as elegant compared to some others, but every bit excellent, and more, for the purpose for which it was employed. Highly satisfied with purchase."
3,Too tall for short people,"There was no description given for height regulations other than how tall the walker was. It was only after we had used it that we discovered the lowest setting was too tall. The model number is for people over 5'5"". It also would be nice to have a lock for the brakes. Other than that, it works fine."
3,Invacare Lightweight Rollator,"This model Invacare Lightweight Rollator was purchased a few years ago by myself. I recommend this product for it enables the person both a place to sit when tired anywhere and a basket for your shopping items. However, many times throughout its use, the brake system had to be adjusted frequently as it did not stop the wheels efficiently and could not be trusted. I would recommend purchasing a sturdier model with better braking ability."
5,worth 10 stars,"This is the best walker I have ever had and I have used them since 2004. I love the bigger wheels, the higher seat and handles and the light weight of the walker. It is a beautiful dark blue and the killer is that it has reflectors on the back legs. It rolls so easily and is so easy to fold up and throw into the back of my truck. I have 4 walkers that I use around my house, in the garage, back yard and front and hope to someday replace all of them with this model. AND, shipping through Amazon was super fast. I am a happy camper."
2,Broke the brace after a week,"This is supposed to be rated to 300lbs, and I'm around 250. It was great when I first got it, and very nice to have nice smooth rolling wheels, as my old one is creaky and sweaky. But the cross bar on the bottom is bolted on both ends, and I had 1 end snap off after about a week. I will be able to find something at the hardware store to fix it, but this is not as sturdy as it was advertised. If you're a heavyweight I would not purchase this one, look for a heavier duty model."
4,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new Invacare Rollator","Just received my new Invacare Rollator from Amazon after just two days. It was easy as pie to put together, and it is magnificent and very sturdy. I couldn't be more pleased 'cause it was also priced right.Many thanks!Queenie from NH"
1,Great fantasy book!,"Anyone who thinks this is a scholarly book, by any stretch of the word, is just fooling himself."
2,"Nice colors, but formula needs work","Perpetually searching for muted violet lipstick shades and lacking brand loyalty, I tried Neutrogena lipsticks and was disapointed by how smudgy the chemical formula was. Smelling and initially feeling pleasant, the lipsticks still have poor overall performance compared to non-hypoallergenic brands.While it may be hypo-allergenic, this specific option would be of little good if the product continously has to be reapplied and it readily melts in room-temperature settings where the product was reasonably expected to remain solid. Attempting to apply a perpetually half-melted lipstick wastes valuable time, and definently did not make me feel beautiful.I have the option of using other brands, but imagine this product's performance is a big disincentive for people who actually must be selective about makeup brands. Surely these same people are entitled to a product actually performing well?"
4,4.5 All Things Are Posible With God!,"Although Mase is back in the rap game...This Book was a Grreat Read I enjoyed his honesty and i truly believe he has a ""calling"" on his life! I strongly advise ALL young people and people in general to get this book u wont be dissapointed!"
5,"MASON, NICE TO HEAR FROM YOU!","I ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS REMEMBER MASON FROM WHEN WE WENT TO MANHATTAN CENTER IN NYC. HE THEN BECAME A FAMOUS GUY AND A SEX SYMBOL TO MANY GIRLS. I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO FIND OUT THAT HE MADE IT IN THE RECORD BUSINESS. FOR SOME REASON I AM REALY HAPPY THAT HE MADE IT OUT. WITH THE WAY THE RAP INDUSTRY IS GOING I DON'T THINK THE FAME AND MONEY WAS WORTH ANY OF IT..I AM GOING TO BUY THIS BOOK BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD THAT HE SPEAKS FROM THE HEART AND THAT ONE CAN REALLY RELATE TO ALOT OF THINGS THAT HE SAYS...MASON, GOD BLESS YOU AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK,"
5,Very Encouraging!!,"This book is very encouraging. It was really encouraging to me, as a young believer to be exposed to the life of a previous rapper who is now an excellent ambassador for Christ and involved with full-time ministry. Not only does he give you his testimony, but he gives it to you cut and dry and doesn't try to sugar-coat anything for you. If you're confused as to why he left rap alone or why he loves the Lord so much I would recommend this book for you to read. I guarantee that after you read this book you would no longer get the two confused, $Mase and Pastor Mason Betha. God Bless."
2,Get it at the Library...don't waste your money,"This book is definately not worth the money and I suspected that so I got it at the libary. It is only 200 pages long with large print. I finished it in a day. I'm an emcee myself so I was interested in why Mase would leave rap so suddenly to follow God. I respect him for that no doubt but he spends most of this book preaching and the rest completely trashing hip-hop as a product of the devil. He rambles on saying things like ""What if Tupac and Biggie had been pastors"" and so on. The book doesn't deserve to be called a biography/autobiography because if you take away the preaching and the anti-hiphop rants the book would be about 10 pages long. Don't waste your money...if you're like me and were just interested in why he made the move from music to the church then get it at the libary."
1,What is this Video,"There are many great BBC Videos, one is ""Of Pure Blood"" from the book of the same name but I doubt this is the video. It aired on the Discovery Channel and another same is ""Selling of Murder"" You cannot get these videos from anywhere in NTSC. They put on a show and before you can set up your VCR it is too late and even if you do it is so full of commercials it is not worth it."
5,battery,"good no complaining, fit on my GL2 and i could film tho whole party. more than i expected for this price."
1,Not good,I recently filmed a wedding and started with my new Digicom BP-945 battery fully charged. The wedding was 20 minutes long and my battery had drained to half capacity.
2,Not good,It says it's suppose to last 8.6 hours...and it did not last for more then 65 minutes. Even the first time when it was fully charged. Not happy with the product.
1,DBROTH IS NOT SELLING DIGICOM...BEWARE,"DBROTH is selling knockoff batteries but advertising them at DIGICOM. DIGICOM is a great brand and the batteries are well worth this excellent price, HOWEVER, DBROTH is doing a BAIT & SWITCH. You will receive a battery that you could have paid 1/4 the price on."
4,It's good!,"I choose this battery because have good price and accordance with my experience on this kind of battery is good.I like it because the duration time is the same like the original battery Panasonic. The only drawback I found is that the cover is very fragile, you need to be careful with the punches.I would recommend this product 100%.Regards!"
4,The Bible,This book is regarded as the bible by me and friends of mine who are studying pediatrics with me. It has a little bit of everything and loads of great pictures. I guess my only criticism is that it doesn't go into enough detail on some topics. Very worth having!
5,A Must-Have,"If you need to buy one Pediatric book for pictures, quick reference, and ease in using, it is this one. It is the first place I go when looking up specific pediatric pathology. It's application to general Pediaric is relevant to all facets of my practice."
3,Great product but over-priced on Amazon,"I purchased these at my local Michael's Crafts for $1.99. They work great, just don't buy them from Amazon."
3,Not one size fits all mini muffin pans,"I bought these to use with the Baker's Secret 24-cup mini muffin pan and... they're too big. I'm sure they work fine, but this is personally a waste of four bucks."
5,Great product,"Mini cupcakes are a great idea for a childrens party or if you are on a diet and dont want to eat a large cupcake ;)Was unable to find mini muffin cups in the store, so glad amazon had them"
3,"Exactly what I needed, at a high price.","I can buy these in my local WallyMart much cheaper than I found here, so look there or at Michael's if you can. But the product was exactly what I needed."
3,"Great book, but not for beginners!","I got this book hoping it will give me some simple, yet thorough advice or guidance to book binding, as I'm into handmade paper making and would like to create different sorts of journals, notebooks, book covers, etc.The book has amazing historical information and detailed explanation on various techniques, but my level is too low and I don't understand much of the technicalities. Also, the illustrations are scarce and that's not a good thing for a beginner.Will look for another book on the subject."
1,Book didn't come with CD!,I was expecting to receive a book and CD together! But it was so disappointing for me to see there is no CD in the package!
3,The Three-Seated Space Ship - a review,"The Three-Seated Space Ship is a science fiction book about the adventures of Eddy, a typical earth boy, Marty, an alien from the planet Martinea, and, unintentionally, Eddy's grandmother. Marty shows up while Eddy and his grandmother are in line for a plane ride to Albany. Marty invites them to look at his space ship, disguised as a little green car. But then, a security guard sees them and they have to make a quick liftoff! This results in a tour of London and a funny adventure!"
3,The Three-Seated Space Ship - a review,"What would you do if your best friend was an alien? The Three-Seated Space Ship is a science fiction book about the adventures of Eddy, a typical earth boy, Marty, an alien from the planet Martinea, and, unintentionally, Eddy's grandmother. Marty shows up while Eddy and his grandmother are in line for a plane ride to Albany. Marty invites them to look at his space ship, disguised as a little green car. But then, a security guard sees them and they have to make a quick liftoff! This results in a tour of London and a funny adventure!"
3,"stays on but turns green, dingy & dirty","This oval table cover does the job because it covers our outdoor furniture over the winter & seems to stay on.However, must be cleaned regularly since it gets green, dingy and dirty out there. Unfortunately,it is not that easy to clean; I did try; got some of it but it still looks pretty bad in some places."
3,Too slow,"I did not know they were slow balls until I received them. If you like slow balls, they are fine. I had to buy a new item."
5,One of the band's best,"This is one of El Tri's greatest albums. Recorded in 1997 and released in 1998, the title fits the concept of the tracks and its timing as the century came to its end. Songs like ""Nostalgia"", ""Todo me sale mal"", ""Quien de un peso por mis suenos"" and ""Todo se vale"" are among the best tracks. The artwork is also good. This is definitely a must have album."
3,Adolescent eco moralizing,"Grotesque eco-fable involving storms, masturbation, big tits, butt plugs and a variety of adolescent fantasies masquerading as mature science fiction. The plot is loosely connected by the Mother of Storms but the high point of too many chapters involves people playing with themselves. As porn it might make a good read."
1,Starts off exciting and slowly peters out.,"This book begins with an exciting and plausible premise of tremendous storms hurling across the world. Unfortunately, the author departs from the storms to bring in dozens of semi-relevant characters, lots of politics, ridiculous sex, and turns the book into a mess. While the storm scenes were written well, by the end of the book I didn't care who lived or died or evolved or how the crisis would be resolved. This book has a lot less to do with storms than a mishmash of the author's ideas that might be better explored separately in a number of books."
4,An entertaining SF book with some novel ideas,"A friend suggested this book to read for a bit of relaxation and I wasn't disappointed. Though it starts a bit slow in order to introduce all the myriad characters, it builds up steam and does quite well to keep the attention there. Some of the scenario is not unlike the movie ""The day after tomorrow"", as the key element is a global superstorm, which effects the whole world, sparing no place.John Barnes must have gone to a great deal of research as the scenario with massive amount of methane being released from the ocean floor is not so far fetched, as research in the last few years have shown the potentially devastating effect on the climate that this can have. I also liked his take on mass entertainment of the future, where people can plug in to a 3D type reality show, where the audience can experience all the emotions and sensations that the actors go through. Some novel ideas in there and some pretty creepy situations too."
2,Disgusting subplots drown good science fiction,"In some ways I liked this book. The stuff about the hurricane was pretty cool. But the endless, tiring subplots about VR child porn and the one orgasm-per-page average got really tiring and downright disgusting. If he had kept the book down below 350 pages and eased up on the endless sexual escapades, I might have liked this book."
3,Great book but riddled with easy to fix scanning mistakes,"I can't put this book down! I've almost missed my subway stop several times reading it. Absolutely love the view of the future, and this is more than enough to hold me over until the next book in the Daybreak series comes out.All that aside, there a number of OCR mistakes that occurred when the book was scanned into digital format, which just makes me feel like the publisher was sloppy and wanted to get the ebook out as soon as possible."
4,"Fans of David Brin's ""Earth"" take note.","In spite of the book's many flaws, fans of David Brin's ""Earth"" and Bruce Sterlings ""Heavy Weather"" should buy ""Mother of Storms."" It's definately a vacation-read, sort of a semi-cyberspace semi-disaster semi-scifi fastpaced interesting Brin-eque book. I found the characters interesting: what a previous reviewer so sarcastically and cynically dismisses as ""the redeemed porn star"" I thought was actually a compelling portrait of the struggle any actor has. If you think you're about to read something literary, check out Donaldson -- for a good sci-fi read, this is a darn fine book."
2,"Silly science, not plausible","This book starts out as a good complex science fiction thriller, set in the very near future, but as it goes along the science becomes sillier and sillier, to the point that it is no longer possible to ""suspend disbelief"" and stay interested in the science. Which forces you to fall back on the characterizations which are, as is usual for sci-fi and pop stuff, pretty flat. I tossed the book without finishing it. Two stars because the author did have some good story ideas going in, and a couple of the storm scenes were quite gripping."
1,poorly organized and written,"This book is one of the worst I have ever started to read (""started"" because I couldn't finish it). At first glance, the plot sounds interesting; but upon actually reading the text, it is lost in a miasma of cardboard characters and uninteresting subplots. The author goes on at great length about a wholly unbelievable technology (which allows one person to experience another's experiences), much to the detriment of the story. On top of this poor organization, the writing itself is amateurish -- not at all helped by being entirely in present tense, as if the author is hoping to distract the reader from the weak plot and characters. There have been very few books which I've started and been unwilling to finish, but this is one of them."
4,If you like pseudo-cyber-punk...,"A nice ride... one of the books I decided to keep in my library and re-read from time to time, it's that much fun. The science is reasonable, not over-bearing and the images painted by the text are vivid. The characters take awhile to develope, but are memorable."
3,weather and disaster go together!,"This story starts a little too slowly for me. The real action begins at about one third of the book. However, I learned a good deal on weather patterns. The most interesting event is the joining of human and computer. It is very originally presented. The technology in this world is convincing.Characters are the usual: industrialist, president and aides, astronaut; an exception here is a XV porn star.Humanity is not wiped out but is given a wakeup call. I suggest this book to everybody who likes this author and disaster novels mixed with science, in this case, meteorology. Not a ground breaking novel but very good in its genre."
5,I LOVE this computer,"Mine is actually a generation back (800MHz processor). It's more than fast enough for the things that I do (graphic design, mathematics, music recording, programming, internet browsing... can you tell I have catholic interests?) The Apple bundled apps are fantastic, and iPhoto incorporates enough of what I do to my pictures that I rarely open PhotoShop any more (not to mention the permanent retention of the original photo is always a good thing). I rarely reboot the system (it's just not necessary unless I do an OS upgrade), or close applications and all is well. It's nice to have Word, Excel, Safari, iTunes, Eudora, Illustrator and InDesign all at the ready at a moment's notice.Perhaps most exciting is the realization that with this machine I just don't need a desktop anymore. My G4 tower gets only occasional use anymore (and the PC hasn't been turned on for nearly a year). This is easily the only computer you'll ever need."
3,Not what I expected,"What I enjoyed about this book was its timeline for how prayer developed in the Western Christendom, its explanations on liturgical prayer in the devotional life of the laity, how it became displaced and its dissection of the breviary as being useful in all aspects of a persons prayer life (vocal, mental and contemplative).The quotes and stories from the Saints were the best part of the book.The author will devote quite a few words to how much he likes certain hymns, psalms or antiphons and will contrast them against devotional practices. I did not feel that his polemic against ""romantic and egotistic sentimentality"" pg 71 found in other devotions to take away from this work. It was when the book took on the tone of apologetics or it felt the need to restate the obvious that it was at its weakest.I think it is worth reading, but I don't know how soon I would read it again."
3,Bigger than expected,"My husband and I were not expecting a doll so big, but it was a pleasant surprise. Only thing is....You could tlel this box had been opened previously. No big deal, and everything was there, but it's disappointing when you plan to give it as a gift, you know?"
5,great product even in a commercial appliacation!,Have bought 6 of these over the years. They are used in our business and hold up to rugged daily use.great because you can refill it while it is hot without getting burned like all the others.
1,Better Clothes Steamer,"It produces great steam, just in big clouds that are better suited for getting wrinkles out of clothes instead of cleaning bath and kitchen. I steam scrubbed my bathtub, grout on bath floor, bath walls, kitchen sink, drip pans on the stove, and outdoor chairs. For the bath, the steam didn't do anything elbow grease couldn't do. The drip pans are better with a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. The outdoor chairs were actually pretty good with the Lysol concentrated and scrubby sponge. It did power through deep down dirt and bird poo, but evaporated so quickly, the dirty soapy foam dried in place. I had to rinse the chairs off to get them completely clean.However, my sister's linen blouse came out great after some quick blasts of steam from the naked nozzle, much better than the actual clothes steamer she purchased. Plus it came with a bottle of Lysol concentrate, so not a complete loss. But as far as actually doing what it is advertised to do, pretty useless."
1,"Unacceptable product ""performance"" and/or quality...","Recently purchased this item latter part of Dec 2007. It's going back as soon as a return authorization is obtained. This unit is big and bulky and does NOT lend itself well to being a very useful ""handheld"", everyday tool, and I found it's accessories uncomfortable to use. Also, I felt it was slow getting ""up to steam"" and it felt ""heavy"" with a full load of water. Additionally, it seemed to not want to work properly when the unit wasn't particularily level. Steam cleaning, in principle, is a great idea, but it seems this product's adaptation and implementation of the principle is not good. Save your money or look elsewhere if you must have a handheld steam cleaning unit; this unit was too expensive and did not work well in this user's opinion."
1,Very Very poor product,"Followed instruction explicitly. Very strange that a unit would be ""ready"" when the ready light goes off... After waiting more than an hour, the light finally when off but the unit produced no steam. I spent a great amount of time troubleshooting and was never able to make it work. Seems very heavy for a steamer unit that I would be holding to steam clean shower tiles, sinks, etc.Would definitely not recommend it."
1,Does Not work,"This product doesn't work. I used it on my stove. After going thru every attachment i gave up and used my Mr. Clean eraser and hot water. That worked better than the steamer. The steam was weak and it wasnt that hot even though the steamer's ""ready"" light was on."
1,Just not impressed,"It's just not worth the time or effort it takes to fill it, heat it, get the cleaner in, etc. Sure, it seemed to work ok... but not any better than a good ol' bottle of bleach spray and a paper towel. It is pretty akward to manipulate too. I tried cleaning my bathtub. I had to have one hand on the steam button and the other to hold the wand... didn't have an extra hand to balance myself when leaning over the tub. It works OKAY but not worth all it."
4,GET IF YOU ARE A FAN OF NO LIMIT RECORDS,"the song major players is very good, it is a OK CDMEAN GREEN WAS A VERY GODD PRODUCER AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE SOULJAS ON THE CD.CHECK OUT TRU - THE TRUTH IF YOU WANT A MORE RECENT NO LIMIT CD."
5,Best stuff ever.,I use this stuff all season. I put as many as I can in my dry bag for cover and then 3-4 on me when I am in the tree stand. I think it workes great as a cover and has helped on many hunts.MC
4,Need extras?,Purchased these for extras for scent control. The price was right and the need was there! Good value at a good price!
5,Best eye creme ever!,Have used dermalogica for years. Tried using other product lines but keep coming back. It's the best eye crème ever!
5,Prime rasta action!,"Having saturated Lee ""scratch"" perry's innovative and ground breaking Dub through the ARKOLOGY set, i can say that this album (REGGAE GREATS) represents the sweet cream of his crop (or maybe the sweet BUDS of his crop). It has many essentials (roast FISH.., police and thieves, party time, my personal favorite: ""WAR INA BABYLON""..and so on) along with great picks to represent his diversity like the ever mind-blowing WISDOM (w/ jah lion). Buy this if you want the best from his prime creative years, and branch out from this album if necessary. (oh, i forgot to add- this cd is best experienced through an intense haze of sweet smoke)"
3,Foaming Soap,"This is a foaming body soap. The scent is OK (I've used the jasmine & the desert) but the product doesn't last long. The wash is very liquid (not a gel or soap) and I need several pumps, several times in the shower to get enough foam to feel like I am getting enough soap to get clean. I go through one of these far too soon (about 3 weeks). I doubt that I will be buying this again."
2,Questionable content,"This is the black and white version of the book - the color version is worth spending the extra money. The discussion of topics such as confidentiality are strangely worded and may not be helpful for young children without additional explanation. However, this is probably one of the best introductions to play therapy available for younger children currently available."
5,Fantastic Book for Therapists & Parents,great book for explaining play therapy or individual child therapy to a young child. Highly recommend therapists keep it in their library to share with clients/parents!
4,Island style,"The upbeat tunes of Jimmy make you feel like you are in the islands. I lirics in many of his songs are very thought provoking, sometimes not politically correct, as in the track Vietnam. This CD has many of the same tracks as the other Jimmy greatest hits release. None the less, great listening."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD","This game is one of the worst soccer games i have ever seen. The animation is bad. The control is even worse. I just couldn't believe my eye. Eventhough FIFA 04 isn't a great game at all, it is still way better than this. Get winning 11, if you want a great soccer game. EA is making this franchise worse, and worse every single year. I still wonder how worse next years version will be. They are really killing this franchise."
2,"Let down, but not surprised, business as usual for EA","After years of some good FIFA games EA goes back to the old trick of leaving out some obvious features that should have been in the game and others that just didn't work. Then they tell you that they will be in next years game.I doubt to many people are purchasing the 2005 version but if you are please reconsider, not one of the better years for the game."
2,seems fifa is making each of its sequel worst than before,the video has minor glitches.the ball and players move slowly.its a pain to get a goal.it just wansn;t right.i didn't like anything in this game
4,A good book on the actual event,"This book, is a very good account of the FACTS. I would rate it second only, to the small ""red book"" (which is the M.V. Ingram book), although that one is rather challenging to find. For those who go to Adams, a few local buisnesses sell it. In any case this one is the more available of the two books,I consider accurate. All the rest I have seen, have sensationalized the story for movies and such. The Bell Witch, movies are filmed in other countries and have either entirely made up facts or huge distortions."
5,This is the antithesis of breezy bios,"The bizarre bohemian-preppy life of Margaret Wise Brown captured by Leonard Marcus in ""Awakened by the Moon"" is an excellent enjoyable read comparable to Andrew Wilson's ""Beautiful Shadow"" biography of Patricia Highsmith. The only flaw is Marcus did not interview Albert Clark, the chief beneficiary of Brown's will and the inheritor of the royalties of ""Goodnight Moon.""This is a highly detailed book, and so it is more ""by a writer, for writers"" than a general or curious audience."
3,"Worthy Subject, Forgettable Biography","It's no small task to create an enchanting picture of an adored figure in children's literature. Unfortunately, Leonard Marcus was not up to the challenge. The biography is too linear, too literal, and written too much like a graduate school study. Still, the segment about her studies at Bank Street College of Education (I'm a grad) was interesting, as was the description of her evolving sense of child development as it affected her story crafting."
4,very gud quality...,very nice to use..it was so big that whole table was covered..quality of material was also good and is durable to use again
4,Now on sale for even more,"At $6.45, this combination towel bar and shelf was a good buy. At the current reduced price of $4.70, it is even better. The workmanship is good, and there is a smooth finish on everything so that it is definitely going to look nicer than my plastic holder did. I purchased it for my laundry room, and it would look nice in a kitchen or be fancy in your garage. The only problem is that it fastens to the wall with two diamond shaped fasteners that will rest on nails. Because there are two fasteners, you will have to level the holder. This item was made in Thailand."
3,Does what I bought it for,"It holds the paper towels, the little shelf on top is nice. The only thing is you really have to be carefull tightening down the ""balls"" on the end when you change rolls. It is very easy to overtighten them and strip the wood out, its very soft. Other than that like the product."
4,Pineapple Jell-O,I was excited to find that I could purchase this here on Amazon. For over a year I've been looking in the grocery stores and was unable to find it. I'm every glad that I found it and the shipping was quick!!!
5,A GREAT book!,"The Redwall series are AWESOME books and so is this. The whole thing rhymes and has wonderful pictures. It is about all the animals in Redwall abbey trying to make a feast for the abbot without him knowing it! Many things happen in the process including a mole child falling in the cake, a barrel of dandelion fizz exploding, and of course making sure the abbot does not find out! Though this book is recommened for 4-8 year olds, I think many Redwall fans will enjoy it and it will also start little children into the amazing Redwall series. This is a GREAT book that I would strongly recomend you go out and buy!"
5,flawless illustrations and a loooong poem,"Fabulous illustrations occupy most of the page in this 64-page poem of 101 six-lined stanzas with an AACBBC rhyming scheme. The story incorporates many of the series' favorite characters, including Matthias and Cornflower, and depicts not only the preparations of a wonderful Redwall feast by hares and mice and otters, but includes a riddle as well.This book is really beautiful and should be read aloud."
5,An adventure satisfying to the heart and soul.,"Having read (devoured) seven books in the redwall series, I expected to be transported into the world of gentle redwallers and their friends, and to revel in their feasts and suffer their setbacks when their enemies torment them. I don't know how these books have remained ""recommended for children to the age of nine years."" Perhaps I have a young mind. I find them every bit as good as ""The Hobbit"" and the Ring trilogy."
4,Simple Program Design A Step-by-Step Approach,"While taking a required course in college, I found myself at an impasse with the school's textebook for this class. While talking with my Academic Advisor, he gave me the title of this book to try to explain what was being said in a more technical language without a breakdown. I will be recommending this textbook to my next programming Professor as a supplemental text for our class. There are people that do not have much programming background in this class and could use a clear concise text that will help them understand the basics of programming. This book breaks it down in a logical order instead of being all over the map like the required textbook.If you are looking for a good text to help you clarify information in another programming textbook then this is the book that is a must to help anyone from the beginning tech to the advanced learner. This text is a definite must even for the casual programmer."
1,Not Simple & Not for beginners,"This books is the only book required for my logic & design class. I am computer illiterate when it comes to programs and coding. In the beginning of this book, it explains the definitions of certain things and then jumps to everything technical. I feel as if I'm just reading words and not comprehending anything. This book is more for someone mid-level and above in computer programming.If you're a beginner, find something else."
2,"Worth the Price, but not recommended","This book is definitely worth the price, but having used this textbook for a class I am teaching, I would definitely not recommend this book. For the beginning student, with no programming experience, this book expects too much. The problems at the end of the chapters tend to assume prior knowledge of a topic not covered in the book. It's a nice book, but NOT for the introductory student."
3,Started out good.,"Well, I'm taking this book as a start to a computer programming course. It is written very basic. And starts the reader out on how to organize program problems to make solutions. However, by the half way point the book jumps from being the basic book it started with to almost a professional additude. And starts to make generalizations on how problems will be handled. It no longer checks the solutions or clarified why things are written the way they are. And as I'm using this as a text book the solutions to the problems in the book just about blow me away. The problems are written generally, and the solutions make assumptions that are not outlined in the problem. It sort of gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. And I said to myself, I would never have thought of all these things to add. It is hard book to learn a simple process to solving problems. it didn't have to be that complicated."
3,Programming,"Well for this one, I found it a bit confusing. I didn't read it much except for a point of reference and definitions."
3,So It's Still Around!,"Listening to a contemporary Giovanni, I looked up this old Glyndebourne/Busch recording from the 1930s. And it's still here! The price, alas, puts it out of contention in the face of so many excellent modern versions. Still, Giovanni is a conductor's opera; and it would be difficult to find better work than Busch's--so exciting. It is the first Giovanni I heard; and my old vinyl hasn't lost its magic. Despite the ancient (though nicely refurbished) sound and the uneven voices, it is still enchanting. (The rating is based on price and sound; the performance is four or five star.)"
4,Comprehensive view of California Missions,"This was very interesting to read, as well as a terrific photographic reference for the California missions. The landscape-page layout lent depth to photos of the beautiful colonnades and porches these missions are famous for. I am proud that my native state of California has done such an outstanding job of restoring these missions, and enjoyed the skill Young and Levick used in crafting this volume."
4,A really good journal!,"I really enjoy writing in journals and this Dawson's Creek Journal is great. The paper and lines are big enough so that you do not cramp your hand writing and the pictures inside are really nice. Inside the cover, it has pictures of each of the main characters and there are 2 other pictures besides the cover. (One has Dawson and Joey and the other has Jen, Pacey, Joey and Dawson.) Get it! You'll love it!"
3,"Not Bad, But Not the Best","I bought this mug and another one at the same time and I have to say this one does not measure up to the other mug. This one will leak if left laying on it's side while full of liquid. It does keep things hot for a couple of hours, but the other mug will keep stuff piping hot for 3 or 4 hours! And the other one doesn't leak. This is a good mug for work, where you aren't going to be refilling it after the first fill in the morning. I don't drink coffee after around 10 AM, and as long as the temp is still warm until then, it's OK. So I use this one at work and the other one at home. This one has to be washed by hand, while the other one can be washed in the dishwasher. Since we don't have a dishwasher at work, this one works just fine, I wash it out at the sink in the kichenette and it's ready for the next morning. It holds my entire 2 cups of coffee at once so I don't have to remix for the second cup. It's best if prewarmed with hot water before filling."
5,Mature,"I bought this for my boyfriend, since I thought this was the perfect signature scent for him.. It is, but it's hard to find larger bottles, since its been out of production since the early 90's I believe. I'd only suggest giving this a shot, if you don't mind hunting down and paying a lil more for a larger bottle. Example: I purchased 1.7 oz for $150."
4,excellent,"This book was an awesome read. Everything I read made sense! Too bad today's doctors, health care providers, or insurance company's will not back to ALCAT test! I can not afford $1200 for the test. But the Book was a great read!"
2,A Little Disappointed :(,"I just watched the video and I have to say this video is not what I expected. I guess someone who has never seen pin up anything might want to watch this but if you are familiar with basics of pin up modeling then I wouldn't bother. The majority of the video is spent on hair and makeup which you can learn on your own in books such as Vintage Hairstyling by Lauren Rennells or You Tube. I was hoping they would explain further how to get into pin up modeling and what to expect when you are on sets and such. I wish they touched on other resources and where to go if you need help getting started. I do have to agree with the other reviewer that this is very amateur and the models seemed nervous at times and there was very little editing when it was needed such as the makeup mess up. I was a little stunned at the poor application of makeup considering that Go Go Amy has done makeup. I guess for the price, I would suggest not to have any high expectations."
4,Super cute,"This is so fun and girly. The techniques are pretty basic, stuff most people have probably seen before, but they add tips on how to use modern styling tools to create vintage looks. They use foam rollers for a wet set, which is good thinking.Another reviewer mentioned the editing, and it's definitely at a slower pace than most tutorials I've seen. Each look is made up of one long shot, and that's appropriate for a vintage piece, convention-wise. I don't meant make it sound like the production value is low, because it's fine, but there are some little quirks about this video: ladies look sort of nervous on camera, the camera is handheld, and there's a lot of big band going on. I found it endearing."
3,how be pin up model-release your inner bombshell,This movie great for beginners. Or have in pin up collection. Photographs part really help you start aInnernpin up model...only part not so great you cantell they reading cue cards.but beside its good dvd...
5,fun video,"This was a really fun video to watch. I have a couple of books on the subject, but it's way more interesting and beneficial to actually watch somebody else doing it! From the makeup, hair and even the posing, it was fabulous!"
4,Great for Pin-up Girls without the Know-how,"I bought this in preparation for a photo shoot. It was helpful in how to do hair, make-up, & perfect a pose. I recommend."
4,CUTE!!!,Cool video! I got it just for wondering what was on it! They give great tips and ideas! I would say a good buy for some one trying to start into Pin Up
3,OK,Its OK but not a lot of useful information. Has some pretty girls in it but its more for the model than the photographer.
3,Delicious,"While I wouldn't go so far as to compare the writing to great Horror writers, but it was easy to read and quite fun. The main character, Charlie, really grows on you quickly. I thought the plot was very interesting. I initially thought it was just another cannibal horror story but that it was not. I really enjoyed the story here although I do have to admit I rolled my eyes a bit at the ending with a big smile."
3,How many wrong turns can one make?,"It was ok and little bit on the rush side as for as putting it together, The first two was the trend setter."
1,Not so good,"I'll keep this short. I had to turn this off about 30 minutes into the movie, and it takes a lot for me to do that. All of the other WT's have kept my interest and were entertaining. This one was a swing and a miss. Very sad, don't waste your time or money. Just my humble opinion......"
4,Different,"O my how the killers are becoming more resourceful! Three- Finger and the gang also have a new pal and he's not a deformed family member!! Not going to spoil anything by saying more. Glad i watched it. Even had to turn my head (kinda) on one scene which is unusual for me. Youll have time to think about what theyre going to do, and trust me lol it happens, and the way the cameras show it will have you cringe! In a good way! Horror fans know what Im talkin bout :)"
1,Worst make up I've ever seen,Do not do not do not do not waste your money on this awful movie. They obviously had no budget.
2,Compared to the other wrong turn movies,This was a major let down. Poor acting and story line. I know how much of a story line does a slasher movie have to have.
1,WRONG TURN WRONG CHOICE,"It's really sad that so many horror movies rely on sadism and senseless violence to lure audiences. Especially when there's nothing else to substantiate their existence. The WRONG TURN franchise is one of the worst offenders and I'm honestly ashamed of myself for viewing all five films....but I swear, no more wrong turns for me!!"
2,alright,The plots are getting to be real dumb. It really didn't make sense. But it completes my wrong turn collection.
1,Should have stopped at the first one,"I saw Wrong Turn on dvd several years ago and this latest installment proves my point that they should have stopped at the first one. Wrong Turn 5 is a complete waste of time and money and if you want a scary movie, don't watch this one.Waste of effort and time. One of the worst movies ever made.Stick with Nightmare on Elm Street, The Exorcist, Halloween and Friday the 13th.Wrong Turn 5 is a zero."
2,Wrong Turn 5,"What can I say. I was hoping that the series would get better. It was better than Wrong Turn 4, but just a pale shade of the original movie. I have noticed the make-up and sets are just not as grissly or hard core as the original movie. The story was better than Wrong Turn 4. But the make up on the hill billy trio looked terrible. The only redeeming quality was adding in their normal looking relative played by Doug Bradley ( Pinhead from the Hell Raiser series ). He was the best part of the movie."
1,24 hour rental...really???,"Saw the first two installments in the WT series and found them entertaining. Had a family issue arise right after we started watching WT5. Imagine my surprise the next night when I sat down to watch my rental and it was no longer available. Shame on me for not checking when I rented it, but I'd kind of figured a direct to video feature like Wrong Turn 5 would be available for longer than 24-hours after my $3 or $4 investment. I've rented movies from Amazon with a much higher pedigree that were available anywhere from 48-hours to 5-days after I purchased it. My bad for not waiting for this flick to find its home amongst similar offerings on Netflix. Here's to hoping Amazon extends the shelf-life of low grade ""B-Horror"" rentals to...I dunno...72-hrs. If I can't find time to consume in three days then I will gladly part with my money and consider the experience as never meant to be."
1,They should stop with this one,Ive watch all of the previous movies but they messed up on this one No concept Hope the next one they put more thought in
3,okay,"first of all, i thought this movie was going to be like the previous ones: uk where the little monsters hide and kill people which makes it kinda scarry. this movie is not scarry at all, the monsters are on the wide open torturing people. i will recommend it to people who like gory movies but not to people who wants to get scared because like i said is not scarry but it does have alot blood"
3,Great for a laugh,"Was this movie great? Absolutely not. Was it entertaining? Absolutely! I have religiously followed all the WT's, and genuinely enjoyed the first two. I even kind of liked the third; despite it's seemingly low budget and hokeyness, it was amusing in its own way. Wrong Turn 4 was admittedly decent, so I had high hopes for Wrong Turn 5 following in the same vein. Sadly, it did not, but the entertainment factor of the movie is not missed on me. WT5 has some killer one liners and at least one pair of nice boobs. The stupidity of the victims and the randomness of the hillbilly cannibals rigging up Jigsaw type traps (which makes no sense, and seriously, WHEN did they find time to make those traps anyway?!?!?) is good for a giggle. Doug Bradly is a nice treat as well, though I did keep expecting Pinhead to make an appearance every time he spoke. I recommend watching with this with friends, and probably with a few drinks to enhance the laugh factor."
3,Pinhead on Skid Row,I didnt recognize him until u hear him speak...then u know its PInhead unmasked. To bad the kills were not abundant.
2,Dumb Dumb City,"I have no idea what goes through a producer/director or the writers head when they made a good film like Part 1, than move it down to hetero slop like two, 3 4 and now five which is probably the biggest dumb ass film they created out of the series.... freaks murdering so openly never afriad of being seen or caught .... feeding one girl her own intestines as she kneels on the street dying.. is this the new HETERO THRILL??? Sick, the movie does nothing to scare you... it merely continued cheap gore effects and eating people... i thought it was mindless and rediculous... those of oyu who don't feel that way, you all probably 8 yrs old. Dumb city. The first film in the regretable series was the only good one.... the 4th had something going but by films end dropped the ball..."
1,End of the Road,"Not worthy of being associated with the original and frightening movie. The line should end here and those who wrote, produced and directed this waste of celluloid should find work commensurate with their talents...film making not among them."
1,what a waste of money,"what a movie, so confusing, and make no sense at all. I didn't understand the movie it was awful. I didn't like not all."
1,If you could only know before the movie started...,"Words alone do injustice to the abomination that this movie is, and I don't say that lightly. The gist of this movie is that kids are going to party somewhere, but end up getting arrested along with a mass-murdering hillbilly. The rest of the movie revolves around the hillbilly's family recapturing him from the town jail. As this happens, the sheriff tries to defend her jail from the freaks in the middle of a town that has no people, and very bad writing arranges to have the killers come out on top.Why do people (like myself) think the stupidity of movies like this will ever give way to a decent movie?AVOID this cinematic wonder..."
1,This even considered a movie?,"Words can not describe this movie nor can I describe what in the heck I just watched. The first four were good but I swear this movie only had a budget of 100$ if that. I mean, the cannibals look bad almost lIke Halloween mask. Very cheaply done and with everything else wrong. This movie was a ""wrong turn"" too many."
1,Awful!,"I recently decided to rent this from my local movie store and I regret it! There's no plot, too unbelievable, bad acting, gore sucked, and it literally took me 3 attempts just to get all the way thru the movie. Yes, it was that bad. Save your money."
1,WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP !!!,"The first few were good but it just went downhill from there.This one is the worst one of all ! The acting is crap , the storyline is crap.This is really a low budget movie and is just a cash out.The movie takes place in a town festival but the town is empty.Where are all the people ? Looks like a fake movie set.The hillbillies look stupid and there are no spectacular kills and effects (which is what wrong turn has always been about). Dont be fooled because Doug bradley is in this because his performance is shocking and makes you realize why he has always been dressed as a monster with limited lines,He cant act ,He went from hellraiser to this ? Even the low budget horror films of the 80's were better than this movie !!! THIS MOVIE IS TOTAL CRAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Wrong turn 5 is a wrong turn,"Wow this movie is so terrible I do not know where to begin! The hillbillys have some supernatural strength and can't be harmed, so it would seem. Even if they can be harmed the idiots in the town have no sense of self defence. After watching this I think I am going to have nightmares. Not from the movie, but knowing my money was wasted. After all these killings started why didn't they just kill the Guy they had in the cell? ? I'm going to half to give this move a negative 5 stars out of 10."
2,What a disappointment..,"I'm a huge fan of the franchise. I loved all the previous films. Even the low budget sequels. This is a big disappointment. This fails to deliver the shock and awe of the original films. There's no real shocking moments, and there's more sex scenes than death scenes. That's a big no no in the Wrong Turn series. If there is yet another Wrong Turn sequel, I hope they revive it. Because this one just killed the series....and the trailer gave us so many promises."
1,Wrong Turn 5,This movie was entertaining but not as good as the previous Wrong Turn movies. The shock value of the movie was very minimal. The plot of the movie and the actors were not good!!! I would advise anyone wanting to see this movie to wait for it to come to free TV!! Its not even worth renting.
1,Horrible,The worst of the movies - nothing good to say.Nasty little movie with nothing going for it - big failure.
1,The Worst Movie Ever.,Ugh. ...I want the time I spent watching this dreck back. It could have been entertaining but it just is absolute garbage.
3,How many wrong turns are these guys going to take?,"Let's be honest, these WRONG TURN movies are very predictable, but they are a good time (most of them). I love these movies that take us deep into the woods and showcase some forgotton world of crazies! Here's another good set of ""isolation"" horror movies that I personally loved that will never see the light of day (if you're a true horror fan, buy them.... they're worth the money):Roadside Massacre,The Abducted. WRONG TURN 5 keeps true to the genre, but is by far the weakest in the series. How long can we keep churning out this series? Quite a while I'm sure. The only long running franchise with a good part 5 was Hellraiser (inferno)."
2,Wrong Turn 5,Same writer and director as part 4 but nowhere near as good...and that's if you actually liked part 4. Nonetheless you get what you pay for. Hot babes and lots of gore. Worth one watch
4,2 albums are better than 1.,"This is basically just the ""Badmotorfinger"" and ""Superunknown"" albums packaged together. Sweet because it's argueably their 2 best albums, and quite the collectors item, and it also gives you the extra track ""She Likes Suprises"", otherwise found on the ""Songs From The Superunknown"" ep, and the ""Superunknown"" double colored vinyl release. Overall though, while owning these 2 albums is a must, owning this collection is not. Still cool though."
1,GENERIC,"The description for this item says ""various artists"", when in reality it is some lame ""generic"" band called ""The Hit Crew"" covering these classic tunes. Don't waste your money or time!I would rate this 0 stars if the system would let me."
3,Really fun but...,"I like Pokemon Trading Cards and all of that stuff but, this was like all of the others. so I enjoyed it."
5,"This DVD teaches carefully, thoroughly and efficiently.","I've watched it many times and plan to rewatch it again and again. Very knowledgable guide, very clear, well presented material."
3,a little to hard,"The game has a good car selection, fun races and all that, but I think its a little to hard sometimes. (and their is no diffuculty setting)"
1,"Was great, but EA killed it off..","This game used to be great. The graphics are a little dated now (2008) but not brutally so. The game play was fun, the customizability of the cars is so wide it's almost irritating, but well worth it.DOWN SIDE - EA dumped the on-line servers apparently, which was half the appeal of the game.BOTTOM LINE - If you've never played it before and can get it really cheap, it might be worthwhile, but don't spend serious money on it."
3,"Overpriced, more show than go....","Yet another console game crammed into a PC format. This is the only racing game that you can spend more time in the menu than actually racing. I can see spending time on a car's setup to improve it's simulated handling, but goofing around picking out roof scoops, side mirrors, spinning hubcaps, under-car neon, trunk audio etc. is just plain silly. Otherwise, it's a fun game with challenging races. If you're the chrome muffler tip, rear wing sporting, cel phone talking type then you will probably love this game. If you're a racing fanatic, you will probably be disappointed. If you're somewhere in between, wait until the price drops."
3,Better Graphics,"Than PlayStation 2, Nice price, Very customizied controller, But wait! you must have a high quality Video Card, I have MSI 9700 256 MB and no use, looks like the game graphics is bad not video card.Any way better than PlayStation 2."
1,This game suck.,"Max Payne like cutscenes + GTA style gameplay = NFS:U2 suck big time. You'll be spending a lot of time cruising the city before getting on the actual race. It's such a drag. I literally fell asleep whileplaying it. I wonder why the developers don't keep the mechanics of the game like the first one. My advice to them: If it ain't broken, don't fix it."
4,Just like I remember,"I used to play this game on the original Xbox when it first came out but now I don't have my Xbox at home anymore so I got it for PC. This version appeared to be from the UK which had at least two different cars in it that I noticed. In the U.S. version I played on Xbox there was a honda civic and acura rsx but in this version there was a peugeot 106 and vauxhall corsa. No big deal, just something I saw. I had a little trouble running it on Windows 7 64bit, every once in a while it would just stop running and the game would close. I ran it in compatibility mode and it helped decrease the frequency that it happened but it did still happen sometimes. I'm a little technologically challenged so if you are good with that type of stuff you could probably figure out a solution. Anyway, fun game, one of the best in the need for speed series."
1,"If you want online play, pass on this","The single player racing for this game is good, with decent graphics and good sound effects. However, if you want to race online, forget it. Don't waste your money. I don't know exactly what the problem is, but it is practically impossible to find an another player to race with online. Judging by the number of ""help me"" message posts on EA's website, many others have the same problem. No one seems to have any answers.I bought this game to race online, as they advertised, so it's a frustrating waste of $20.00."
2,the best game ever it is suck on uk version,i remember using my honda civic on need for speed underground 2 but unfortunately i bought the uk version and it is sucks
3,It's OK.,This is a pretty standard road-race game. The graphics are nothing special. This is not to say that I didn't enjoyed it but it didn't hold my attention too long.
5,This is the only racing game that matters.,"I have owned a minimum of 10 different copies of this game, for XBOX, PS2, PC, GC, any platform I could find of it. I always have loved this game. The only problem with mine is that the seller gave me the UK version, which exchanges the beautiful Honda Civic and Acura RSX Type-R, the two cars I love the most from the game. FAIL SAUCE. Other than that, buy this game if you are thinking about it, you won't be disappointed. This holds true even if you aren't a big racing game fan, even a few different girlfriends have gotten into it. (Protip: letting them win a few races gets you some action, and I'm not talking about behind the wheel;) WINNING)"
2,Loading Problems,"This game has several loading problems that haven't been solved no matter the operating system or the requirements of your PC, the first time I played was about 4 or 5 years ago and still having the same problems at the present day with a high range PC, too bad for it because is really entertaining."
1,Wrong Again,You sent the wrong Big Wheel. The picture is right with the white wheels and solid rubber tires.But you sent the Big Wheel with black wheels and Pneumatic tires.You need to hire some one with some Quality Control or hire a responsibility person.ThanksLarry
1,Enquiring minds should keep away!!!,"This CD is not even worth rating . it's funny how much trouble poeple go to, to produce such weak material. She needs to go back in the studio, and come again. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK."
2,Not Worth Buying,"Gangsta Boo shows on this CD how wack her lyrics are. Only tracks 3, 8, and 11 are worth a listen."
1,"Wack with a Capital ""T"".!!!","Gangsta Boo has got to be one of the most boring female emcees I have heard. As far as quality in flow, she can't be compared to Lauryn Hill, Queen latifah or even Lil kim. The CD is nothing more than another solo try to make more money. She should just stick with 6 Mafia!"
5,damn!!!!!!!,"just as i suspected, this tape isn't off the hook, it's off the hinges. three-6-mafia is my favorite group ever. i have alll three-6-mafia albums, prophet posse, the kaze, and indo g, and they are all top notch hardcore gangsta rap at its finest. this along with the albums i just mentioned stay in my cd player at all times. every time i listen to it, it gets better. the best songs are ""who we be"" and ""don't stand so close to me"". the whole prophet posse is on this cd. i dont know what else to say. the label is called hypnotize minds, & that's exactly what they do. Boo is a much better lyrisist than foxy & kim put together. if you like gangsta rap, you better get this. also look out for ""Tear da club up thugs"", the new album out feb.2"
4,Von Dutch,A very well written book by respected automotive writer Pat Ganahl. It is the life and work of the interesting and slightly crazy early auto paint striper Von Dutch. Includes some great photographs. If you are interested in old school automotive customizing I would recomend this book.
3,Why this book!?,"""WHY SPOIL A GOOD STORY WITH THE TRUTH!?"" (Dutch's favorite saying about writers.)Well...the pictures are great, but there are way too many contradictions.....the author admitedly confesses the truth being hard to come by.Well then....WHY THIS BOOK!?"
3,Short,The biggest problem I find with this DVD is that it is only 30 minutes long and just chips away at the tip of the iceberg for how to frame your arguments against conservatives. I think this movie should be re-done to offer more insight than just attacking Bush and giving some easily defeatable ideas on how to beat conservatives
1,BAD Vinyl to CD transfer,This album was NEVER released on CD. It has only been made as a Vinyl to CD Bootleg copy. Buyer Beware!
1,horrible legacy that should be extinguished from the annals of music history,"quite simply the gayest, stupidest music i've ever had the displeasure of hearing. people ought to buy copies just to destroy them so hopefully there will be no more copies of this in print. i knew of some cat that worked briefly in the medley police department who would take menudo posters for target practice with his gun-lol"
3,good quality but small,I would probably not buy them again because they are very small stickers and we expected larger. They are good quality though.
3,Economical,"I am an electronic technician, and I purchase this unit for my service van. My van has no rear view mirrow and the blind spots were driving me crazy to paranoid, so I purchase the VRBCS300W to help me with the blind spots. I checked the system on my test bench and all systems checked perfectly...good reception, different angle views, operational control of brightness and contrast. The installation into the van went smooth...good installation instructions. I really like the way the camera can mount in harmony with the tag; there is no need to do a lot of drilling to mount the camera! The performace in the van was similar to the performance on my test bench and for the price, compared to other systems, you get your money's worth. The only thing I didn't like about the VRBCS300W is the small display(2.5' LCD screen), and there is no video output for an aux. monitor (3.5 stars)"
1,Useless,"I am extremely disappointed in the reception. The screen constantly is jumping back and forth that I can't even see anything when I back up. Of course, I returned it. However, I already drilled a hole in my trunk to install the camera and now I am stuck with a hole in my car. I feel so regretful purchasing this useless unit."
3,Decent,"For the price this is decent; works; no complaint.Caveat: LOUSY customer service; any questions or issues, you're on your own."
2,Low price = Low quality,"Wireless is worthless. Plan on buying a cable and hardwiring the camera to the monitor. The monitor lasted about 6 months before failing. Moisture gets in the camera easily and distorts the picture.When it works, it works good. Just don't expect it to hold up under stress. The price is fair for what it does.Edit: I just noticed some vendors are selling this for a ridiculous price. This product is not worth more than $40."
1,Useless in high humidity environments,"It will eventually fill the camera lens with water from condensation. Looks like the camera needs to be filled with an inert gas and sealed properly to prevent this. Apparently, it isn't!"
1,Poor reception - basically useless,"I am extremely disappointed in the reception. The screen constantly is jumping back and forth that I can't even see anything when I back up. Of course, I returned it. However, I already drilled a hole in my trunk to install the camera and now I am stuck with a hole in my car. I feel so regretful purchasing this useless unit."
5,works great,Camera works great for a car that you con not see very well when backing.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HWXGOS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
2,"Good Price, Lens is Not Water Proof","I really liked this back up camera initially. It was crisp and clear and did everything it was advertised to do. However, note that the housing around the camera is not waterproof. So when it rains it will will get wet and dirty and becomes virtually impossible to clean and you are left with a fuzzy picture.I don't recommend this product. It's useful life is reduced as soon as it is exposed to heavy rain. I emailed the company several times to see if they had any info on cleaning the lens (which is impossible). They never replied. So this is a throw away product. Use and discard when done. So don't waste your money on this product."
2,Screen is too small,"Screen is too small, camera eye itself is bulky to mount and if mounted as directed would cover the word Massachsetts on the plate which is illegal. Needs to be hard wired as the wireless picture is undependable"
2,not that great,"this is a cool product, but it wasn't long before it began to malfunction.the lcd screen is 40% ""static"" and cuts in and out. I had to return the camera b/c condensation developed inside the lens and blurred the video image.if you are looking for a true safe rear camera, I do not reccommend this"
3,Great idea but the interference is significant,Over all the product was pretty impressive. Installation was easy and the field of view as well as quality of picture were good. The only issue is the amount of interference with other wireless devices. Other devices such as cell phones and blue tooth devices (which are now everywhere) can turn the image into garble. That can be very frustrating when you are trying to get into a tight spot.
1,Back Up Camera,I am very disappointed in this back up camera system. It is not easy to install. I have had 2 people try. I am now going to have to pay to have it installed. If I hadn't pasted the deadline for returning the camera I would have sent it back for a refund. I would not purchase this product.
1,Don't waste your money on this item,"I bought this camera installed it and experienced interference almost everywhere. I called the company tech support waited twice for 45 minutes and was told that interference is normal. Bluetooth, power lines, 2.4 ghz phones, cell phones, and wi/fi will cause interference. Dah? That's everywhere.I told them I wanted my money back, they refused. This is junk!! don't buy it."
1,save your money,"save your money .i am haveing problems with model VRBCS300W getting a picture on the monitor from the camera ,that is install correctly,this is week 4 trying to reach there tech support by phone .it always busy during there work hours (like it off the hook 24hrs a day},so next step emailing there CUSTOMER SERVICE ,witch i get a return email saying call support. so i wasted money on this ,dont buy this product ,think ill pay extra and buy another brand at the local auto parts supplier"
1,Dont waste your money,Did not work very well for me.I tried to use it on the back of my RV and the distance was too far plus it didnt work that well even close up.
2,Save your money,"On my 2nd unit after 2 years, the problem was that the camara is not air tight as it gets condensation making the camara picture unviewable. Also, the camara is useless at night. I'm in the process at looking at other brands to solve the issues above."
1,Fragile camera,"I live in Florida where we have high temps and humidity. A year after installing this system, the camera lens clouded up and fractured, rendering the unit useless."
2,"Just so, so...","This backup camera works but not nearly as well as others that I have used. I'm using mine with the optional direct video/power cable which gives a much better video signal than wireless but still isn't very good. The bluetooth in my vehicle causes significant interference with this unit so I have to turn off the bluetooth when using the backup camera. However, even with the bluetooth turned off I still get some interference. The backup camera in my Tundra (not the same make or model as this unit) works perfectly every time without any signal interference. I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone nor would I purchase another one. I'm stuck with it now so I'll use it until it breaks."
1,absolutely no customer service,"I bought this back up camera with the intent to use it on the back of my travel trailer, by hooking it to one of the running lights so It would be on while I am driving and act as a rear view camera. All worked well, but once the vehicle was started, it received interference from the engine, not too bad, but once we were on the road, it was impossible to see becuase of the interference. It would appear that I have an older model without an video input plug, so I have emailed the customer service dept 8 times to ask in detail if there is any possibility that the wired option would work on my unit. The wired extension is a 3.5mm which is not on my unit. I did not receive a single response from them, so I tried calling, this was even more of a nightmare, 25 minute wait times, do they only have 1 person who works there? I will be attempting to return this unit and purchasing a different model/manufacturer. I would not recommend this for anyone."
4,For My Truck Camper,"I bought this system to use with my truck camper. I've only used it twice but it works fine. It is especially helpful in low light situations. The screen is small but I was not seeking detail, just an aid in backing up without hitting something. I does what I bought it for."
4,Back up camera,"As an electronic technician i can say that many customer may believe that those devices worth nothing.Personally i instal one of those cameras in my SUV & so far it works very good.However,since i knew that the flexible antenna's position is critical for better performance i went further & purchase one of those popular fake cellular antennas at one of those auto shops for $ 9.99 (auto zone),remove the plastic coat at the bottom by filing it & weld/attached it to camera's antena transmiter,furthermore place it to the rear windshield on the inner side & it works great."
1,Stop working right from day one,"It worked for a couple of times at first, but then stopped working right on day one. Don't waste your time and money."
2,Buy At Your Own Risk,"I've seen my neighbor with The Wireless Backup Camera and allowed me to test it out. This is a good, inexpensive, and reliable after-market accessory that adds a tremendous amount of driving safety. BUT...I cannot recommend it for one simple reason - this thing can attract car theives out of the woodwork - just like the after-market GPS devices do. My neighbor's car was broken into just the other day. The thief removed the camera from the rear license plate, and ranshacked the car looking for the video monitor. My neighbor took the monitor out of the car, but nevertheless, he had to deal with the hassle of repairing the damage and seeing his auto insurance rates increase. There must be a better was of securing the operation of this device."
3,I Like It!,"I ordered this after seeing it on ""The View"". My husband and I both drive SUV's and backing up can be a problem. I always felt like I might be missing something I should be seeing. No More! I knew that we would have to have the camera installed but the cost ($50.00), added to the price of the camera, was still much less expensive than the other camerasavailable. The screen is a bit small but you can place it wherever you want. I have recommended this camera to many friends and family members, and everyone who has tried it likes it."
1,"WIRELESS???? Yeah, right","If by wireless, they mean having to drill a hole through the back of the vehicle in order to snake the camera wire through to the inside of the car, and then having to drill another hole in order to connect the camera wire to the car's back-up light wires, then yeah, it's wireless. Foolish me, I thought wireless meant no wires. For those of you who don't have degrees in electrical engineering or electrician's tools, this is a useless piece of equipment. The price is right, but the average person is then going to have to have it professionally installed to the tune of another $100-$200. Wireless my arse."
2,Not for beginners,"This book is a must read eventually because of its incredibly detailed account of glass working. However, it is a poor book for beginners. Very few and old pictures are a blaring tell tale sign, as is the fact that they seem to make stained glass a lot more complicated than it needs to be for the beginner. If you're looking for a good starter book, keep looking!"
2,good text but very poor photographs,"This book has lots of good information and fairly comprehensive text, but I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the photographs. They seem to be snapshots rather than professional photographs illustrating techniques and equipment."
2,A fairly amateur look at stained glass,"Back in the 60's and 70's when there was nothing else available, the first edition of this book was still a poor resource Manuel. This book promoted the idea that 50/50 solder should be used in lead came construction and 60/40 should be used when doing copper foil construction. This is just the opposite of what should be done since 60/40 has a lower melting temperature and so should be used with came to lessen the risk of melting the came.Now that there are many more good to great books on stained glass, give this tired tome a rest and get one of the newer, better illustrated books a try. Even a video on stained glass would be better than this poor attempt to educate.Beginning Stained Glass"
5,My baby loves these!,These are a great alternative to those pig's ears they sell at the pet food stores. I feel better giving them to my dog & he looooves them. They are his favorite snack.
3,Follow up to Night Nurse!!!,"Not as good as Night Nurse but the second track ""Private Secretary"" is really good. Worth buying, if you love the ""Cool Ruler"""
4,A good thriller,Ms Lynds writes a good thriller. In quality she can compete with the big boys. But she does have a tendency to have her characters radiate intense emotion constantly when there is no need for it.
3,Not mesmerizing,"Far too long and wordy and filled with lengthy political and philosophical discussions----the original premise is fascinating (transplanted memories from the heart donor) but I was annoyed at the insertion of a romance-novel type encounter in the middle of a desperate attempt to prevent havoc----also, how did the Feds track down all the Keepers? did I miss something in the middle of all the Capitalism v. Communism harangue? or was it just not addressed?"
1,Do you notice the cover picture?,"I won't be purchasing this book due to the photo on the cover! I'd say most yoga teachers know that you don't work tree pose by placing your foot on the knee joint (it goes below or above, but not directly on) because they don't bend in sideways directions. I don't think what I am saying is controversial. I'll pass on this one."
5,... more than 5 stars !,"Compared to the Legends book about Ruffian this earns more than 5 stars !! It is personal, touching (prepare lots of kleenex) and written nin a good style. If you love horses and are not afraid to weep like a child: buy it at once."
5,Ruffian vs. Seabiscuit,"Reading these 2 books within weeks of each other it was difficult to compare the two. Both horses were so incomparable in their time, yet both so courageous and gave so much heart to their sport. I wish I could have been there to see either of them race. I can only give my opinion after reading about them. It would have been the greatest race of all times between Ruffian and Seabiscuit - she the greatest filly, Seabiscuit the greatest colt. Different times, different courses. Who knows. Both great horses, both great books!!! Ruffian is the tear-jerker of all times!!! Get a BIG box of tissues!!!"
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK,O MY GOD I LOVE THIS BOOK. IT IS SOOO GOOD. ITS VERY DEATAILED AND TELLS YOU EVER THING ABOUT HER LIFE. I FEEL LIKE IM ACTULLY IN THE RACES AND I CAN PICTURE EVERYTHING. I DONT NO IF YOU GUYS NO THE STORY OF RUFFIAN BUT IT IS SOO SAD! I CRIED. AND NO IM NOT JOKING I WAS LITTERLY CRYING!!!! I REALLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK AND IT WAS SO GOOD I THINK IM GONAN READ IT AGAIN!
5,Ruffian,Great book from beginning to tragic end for this powerful filly. Well written and gave great insight into that world of horse racing.
4,Wonderfrul story,"After reading Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit, the writing style of this book paled in comparison, but oh what an wonderful story nonetheless. Ruffian's lightening speed frightened those closest to her; trainer, owner and jockey. For those who love a good true horse story of a thoroughbred filly who is faster than the ""jocks"" I highly recommend this book!"
3,Unobjective and Shallow,This book could have been a well researched inquiry into the death of an outstanding equine athlete. instead we are left with the author`s apparent conclusion that no earthly factor was at fault in Ruffian`s death including her trainer Frank Whitely or her owners. In particular there is incredibly no discussion at all of the incredibly reckless decision to run any racehorse in a mile and a quarter match race two weeks following a race at a mile and a half. The author makes it seem like the race campaign engineered by Ruffians connections was normal when it was anythng but. There are no answers here only questions.
5,Excellent!,This book is sooo good. I started crying at the end! Ruffian is amazing! I recommend this book to all fans of Horse Racing!
5,I read it in two days,I almost didn't read this wonderful book because I knew how it ended. But I am so glad that I devoured it this weekend because it was uplifting in its story of such a special filly. I also learned so much about every aspect of horse racing. The filly's human family was depicted as caring and smart horsemen. But the best part was getting to know Ruffian who lived to run.
1,Don't order online,"I ordered a subscription for the Electric Flight magazine online and have yet to receive an issue. I believe the magazine would be something I would enjoy reading but I wouldn't know. If I had any suggestions to offer, I would never order online again for a magazine subscription as this seems to be a waste of money, time, and effort."
2,nothing i couldn't get from his discography,"this book was a major disappointment. i picked it up hoping to learn a little about tom waits motivations and approach to music making. instead i got a very dry and shallow biography seemingly written based almost singularly on tom waits' discography. there's nothing revealing in this book, just an album by album recollection. it's a decent reference if you want to know about all of waits' works, but then again you can find a lot more of this sort of information on the web. the padding in this biography is snippets gleemed from interviews.very uninteresting read."
3,Kill Your Idols?,"I recently completed reading the Tom Waits biography by Cath Carroll and rather enjoyed it. It is a small volume and quite slim at 136 pages including both a few black & white photographs and the index. It is divided into three parts. Part one: The Story, Part Two: The Music, and Part Three: The Legacy. I believe that one reviewer stated that he could get this information from liner notes. While this is only partially true I do agree that much of the information is readily available elsewhere. There is however some writer insight. Ironically, under part Two, one thing lacking was the personnel on each album."
2,Very Specialized,"It is all about one type of monster in one game world. If you want to know everything there is to know about lichs in Ravenloft, then you have too much time and money. If you don't want to pay however much money to know about one monster, then you've got one less useless book than I have."
1,shipped wrong item,Hats were never shipped. Instead a ceramic dashhound (wiener dog) was shipped that was to be painted.Invoice and shipping notice had the hats but somehow no hats wre in the box. It was too late to reship and correct problem cause birthday party was scheduled and didn't want to take a chance on re ordering.
4,Great Series - Roasting,"Love these books beacuse you can focus on a specified aspect of cooking. As with the others in this series, I love the layout. Informaton is presented in a user friendly format and is well illustrated."
5,great roasting!,my favorite cook book. the high temperatures really shows of flavor! highly recommend it!
4,original & different light design,"delicate material but different & special design, better for interior. Execellent price-value worth."
1,It just keeps getting worst,"After five long years, Jason Sherbrooke is returning to England. Deciding to by a horse farm, Jason comes up against Hallie Carrick who would also wants the farm. Deciding to become parnters. After a while, they learn to love each other.I wanted to like ""Lyon's Gate"" by Catherine Coulter but this book was bad. I don't know what's wrong with Ms. Coulter, but the charm is gone. Her earlier books were so much better, but lately it seems that she is writing book for the money and not for the readers. So save your 9.99 or just buy a better book."
1,Simply Awful,"This was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read... I say attempted because I could not finish it. This book was simply not worth my time. Hallie was immature, self-centered, shrewish and selfish and we are supposed to believe that Jason found this attractive? I cannot believe Catherine Coulter wrote this trype. The situation of the two of them living in the same house during this time period was ridiculous. And this book was an RT award nominee !! What were those people thinking !"
1,Agony!,I generally do most of my reading when I travel. This took me several trips (and months) to complete. I have read some that just start slow but I didn't like Hallie from the first moment and was sorry that she would be the love interest. She was a total shrew and I don't understand how he was even physically attracted to her. She hated him then threw herself at him at the sight of bare chest?!I wish I had read these reviews before putting myself through this pain!!!
2,STOP TELLING ME HOW HANDSOME JASON IS!!!!,"I have been a Coulter fan for years. I love that she has created a historical soap opera with all her characters.This one I had to force myself to finish I nearly stopped 1/3 of the way through but persisted.I really became sick of hearing how handsome Jason was not once or twice about 50 times and how women are always fainting or throwing themselves at Jason and his brother.If you wish to read a good CC book, check out her older stuff they are wonderful."
1,Disappointed at best,"I really was disappointed with this book. Catherine Coulter's novels are usually very entertaining and easy to read. I have read almost every one. This one, though, was very hard to read and very easy to put down. There was too much dialogue and most of it wasn't very entertaining and scenes jumped from one to the other without thought. There wasn't any emotion involved in this book. I really wasn't happy with this one and am sorry I spent the ten dollars for it."
4,Lyon's Gate by Catherine Coulter,"I enjoyed this book, just as I have all of her books. I always pick up her books the first day of release, and I must admit that I waited about a week to purchase Lyon's Gate because both twins were covered so well in the previous book, that I thought I had already read this twin's story. I thought that the story was well developed and humorous."
3,Lyon's Gate,"Jason Sherbrooke returns home again to England after having a dream about his twin brother. Determined to start afresh, he sets out to buy a horse farm, Lyon's Gate, but has a rival for the ownership, one Hallie Carrick. Before either knows what's happening, they find themselves yoked together as partners in business, and despite the constant barbs that fly between them, it turns into a more intimate partnership before too long. However, the road to love is not without potentially dangerous pitfalls.*** As the beloved Sherbrooke clan continues to thrive and add new characters that give it dimension, Ms. Coulter's fans will be well pleased with the results. Warm hearted humor combines with passion to deliver a novel that has all the hallmarks of a classic Coulter. ***"
2,Should have sved my penny...,"I have been a Coulter fan for 20+ years and I eagerly await each new release. After reading all of the reviews I decided not to buy this book. However, I found it for a $.01 and couldn't turn down the deal. In retrospect, I should have saved my penny and thrown it into the fountain at the nearest mall. I would have made a wish that Catherine Coulter could still write books the way she used to. Don't waste your money even if it's only a penny...."
1,So disappointing!,"I was so disappointed in this book. When I met Jason in The Sherbrooke Twins book I was really looking forward to reading his story but his character and that of Hallie are unbelievable weak. From the very beginning the story is weak and not the least bit believable for that time period or this! The way that the Sherbrookes respond to Hallie is also horrible and makes me not like the Sherbrookes anymore at all, they are all very shallow and selfish. I have no desire to even read The Wizard's Daughter when it is released."
1,This Book Is A Waste Of Time!! Save Your Money!,"I have read Catherine Coulter for years and have always been a fan, but this book was TERRIBLE!!! It starts off SO slow and the hero of the book Jason Sherbrooke doesn't even show any interest in the heroine of the book until page 178 and even then it is a barely worth mentioning. Their first kiss doesn't even happen until page 283, so you can see what I mean by a slow read! Hallie Carrick is so disappointing, she has none of the great qualities I desire in my heroine. She actually borders on the obnoxious. There isn't really anything good I can say about this book, it does improve slightly in the end, but it is definately too little to late."
1,Don't buy me!,"Listen to all the other reviewers. It's THAT bad. I was at the airport facing a nice relaxing trip & saw the book & bought it despite the bad reviews on here, thinking: it can't be THAT horrible. It is. Oh, how beautiful is Jason. Oh, how beautiful is Halle. Oh, how dumb & boring could a story be? I only finished the book because of my long love of CC's books. I SHOULD HAVE FOUND OTHER THINGS TO DO."
5,Catherine Coulter books,I have read alot of her books and totally enjoy her story lines. Haven't read all of the 'bride series' yet; getting organized so that I can figure out which ones I still have to read from this series. Am just getting into series books.
3,Interesting...,"The author wrote A Golden Dream, a continuation or a beggining for H.B piper's Fuzzy Papers. Yet I didn't find this a fast paced fun filled book. Though it had it's perks. I was unable to get deeply involved with the book. The chacters are well brought up, but still they didn't have much appeal. It was also very hard to understand the story. As if deep down there was also another stroy inside this one, which I coudn't find to exsplain the first. Though I wouldn't reccommed this title to everyone it is a good book, but a wonderful Author. ~Isriah~"
1,"Outdated version, does not work","Beware - do not waste your money on this one. I would give this ZERO stars if I could. We ordered the Mac version for my son for his birthday. He was so excited about getting this ... little did we know that this software is using an operating system that has been discontinued for at least 10 years! When I tried to file a claim, seller would not honor it!"
5,Love this show,"Death really is an awesome show, I watched it when it came out on IFC and taped it. Sadly my dvr screwed up and couldn't rewatch it. The Kids play their parts well and minus the cops in town and a surprise juror, everything is fresh and new. I highly recommend watching it if you can and getting this on tv dvd is a must."
5,good stuff,"If you're a fan of the original, you'll more than likely approve of this. It's not as good as the original series, but at worst it is entertaining, and sometimes will have you laughing out loud."
3,running time listed wrong on amazon,"i purchased this based on the running time listed at 500 minutes,in fact the running time is less than 180 minutes.please change the listed running time so the product is not misrepresented to other customers."
5,Classic Kids in the Hall,"I've been a huge Kids in the Hall fan for many years and was thrilled to see them come out with a new show. In fine KITH style, their wit, timing, and outrageous humor didn't fail! Excellent, fun, irreverent show and highly recommended."
4,"Diversity, Depth, & Drama","The Fiend Folio: Tomb of creatures malevolent & benign is a great compendium of creatures with well written and drawn descriptions of who the monsters are and why they do the things they do. This is a combination of the author's creations and the cream of hundreds of player's ideas that were submitted to be in the book. I especially like the fact that many of the creatures come from the minds of the people who play this game! It creates a wide diversity of creatures that are good, evil, and just plain strange."
5,I am crazy about this CD,"I have had this CD three days. I've listened to it 100 times. Each time I liked it more than the last. It is so pleasing to listen to her sing these beautiful songs that are such familiar memories of other times.As a Country and Western star, I think she is terrific. It is a wonderful surprise, however, to hear her sing so beautifully in another genre. I loved her interpretation of ""Don't Worry Baby"" with the Beach Boys. But this stuff knocks me thouroughly away. I think I am going to buy another copy of ""Secret Love"" and give it to someone I like."
1,Secret Love,"This CD leaves alot to desire from Lori. I have most all of her other albums and I play them over and over. This one I listened to once and that was enough. This is not the Lori I love. Maybe she should have kept it a ""Secret"""
1,"The kind of performances here, are not my kind","This is the first Lorrie Morgan cd that i have ever bought. I bought it because i heard one or two tracks on our local radio station. After i bought this cd and started playing the songs, i realized that this cd was not for me. Lorrie has the country twang that is required for country music, but the twang does not work on the standards. It's a shame that Lorrie couldn't drop the twang long enough to do this recording.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
1,I really hated it!,"I usually read reviews on Amazon of CD's I'm interested in, but in this case, I just bought without doing my homework. But, since I seem to be in a minority about hating this CD, the reviews might not have done me any good. I like most of Lorrie Morgan's music, but not this. I don't think she has the right kind of voice for these tunes. My personal belief is that Carly Simon's 20 year old album ""Torch"" is the only 40's remake album that is worth having. This effort of Morgan's sound like Doris Day with a bad cigarette rasp."
3,"Good, and bad.","There's really just two things to say about this collection. First of all, despite being rather short and missing numerous great songs, what's here is still wonderful, and a good though odd mix of classic INXS songs. Secondly, and more to my point, ""Greatest Hits"" is way better than this collection, ""The Best Of"" is much better than ""Greatest Hits"", and ""Shine Like It Does: The Anthology"" blows all these out of the water. In short, this is good if it's all you can get your hands on, otherwise grab the 1 disc ""Best Of"" or the 2 disc ""Anthology""."
5,Best cart ever!!,"I have owned this cart for years and would be really surprised if there is one better. Not only is is rugged but ergonomic as well. It is perfectly balanced so that when tipped to the ground can be loaded directly from the ground with less lifting. Also, it can be pulled behind you like a horse and cart, far easier than pushing. Highly reccommended."
5,Cool watch,"I've had mine for several month and I like it very much. It looks great, no need to wind it or change batteries. Very nice product."
1,Disappointed by Hardlex crystal,"After spending 40 years with a watch on my wrist, and changing watches every couple of years without breaking a single one of them, I decided to buy a watch that I *really* liked, that I would keep for a while, and that would not have to send back to Seiko every two years for battery changes (for waterproofing). So I bought this one.I cracked the Hardlex ""crystal"" twice in 12 months. The first time I had it replaced. The second time I am calling it quits. How is it possible for this material to break so easily, when I have never previously broken a watch? I cannot be that hard on them... Hardlex (or the variety of it that comes on this watch, since Seiko uses different varieties for different watches) simply cannot be classified as good quality protection for this watch. Possibly the glass does not have enough curve and is too flat in this watch to resist impact?"
5,Its a SEIKO !,"Great watch, great design, Kinetic Mechanism means no battery needed. And its a SEIKO !"
2,Kinetic function is disappointing.,"This is a very attractive watch and seems to work well once you subject it to enough movement. Therein lies the problem -- seems that you have to wear it every day in order for the ""kinetic"" function to keep time. I bought this for my boyfriend since I love my Citizen Eco-drive and expected Seiko's kinetic system to be similar. I was wrong. I have had my Citizen for years without any problem, even if I don't wear it for a period of time. Since my boyfriend has a blue collar job, he doesn't wear this dress watch every day. When he does wear it, he has to reset it and give it enough motion to get it to work. We are quite disappointed. My intent was to give him something with less maintenance, not more. Wish I had bought a battery-operated watch instead. If you're not going to wear it every day, I'd suggest you purchase another brand or a battery model."
5,great watch,"I bought this watch as a gift for my father. He really loves this watch, he uses it on a daily basis. It has been a year now and the watch still looks great. It can be used daily and on special ocassion as well since it looks great every time. It has work perfectly all this year. Highly recommend this product."
5,Excellent watch,Keeps perfect time. Easy to read face. I little heavier than my previous watch. Very pleased with ths watch.
5,Breathtaking stories,"These stories will make you laugh and cry out loud or even whisper an astonished affirmation to yourself because the author makes you recognize people you never realized you knew. Each word of each sentence is carefully chosen to convey the precise insight. Because of that care and skill with language, every one of this author's sentences is worth a thousand more ordinary books. The stories take you out of yourself and you return to your own reality with a greater understanding of your world."
5,Best stapler imaginable,"I have bad stapler karma. In my hands a succession of staplers have jammed, become impossible to reload, fallen apart, or otherwise broken. Not so Swingline's Power-Ease. In fact there's something magical about it. Place a bunch of papers in position (I've tried up to around 15 sheets), push down on the top of the stapler lightly (as in barely), and poof -- staple success. It has never jammed. Reloading is a snap. On one bad morning I inexplicably forgot how to reload the thing (recall my bad stapler karma). I called Swingline and within seconds got to speak with a cheerful and helpful representative who reminded me how it's done (it's really VERY simple). She even managed not to snicker."
1,Do not buy this stapler!!,"Great idea, but one to three months after we purchased/exchanged, four out of the five are jamming and unusable.We are going to try them with regular staples (as per suggestion on the Staples website) Unfortunately that leaves us with boxes and boxes of the RECOMMENDED staples that do not work.BTW, do NOT try to contact Swingline for satisfaction. Their contact site does not work and I got no response to the fax that I sent."
3,Swingline Optime PowerEase - good,"I purchased this when my old stapler broke because I have something like 200 boxes of standard staples (very long story) and I wanted to use them up.It does what it says and I mostly use it while it's sitting on the desk rather than trying to pick it up because it's oddly heavy. No jamming. No real complaints.It isn't as easy to use, nor does it go thru as much paper as the Optima 70 does - which I also purchased - but the 70 takes special staples. However, I like that one enough that I may just donate this stapler and my standard staples.It works without problems. A bit heavy and awkward if you have any dexterity issues but I bet it will last for years and years."
5,Great Stapler,"This staper is great, works really good, and it is a product which i would want to buy if i ever need another stapler"
3,Mostly plastic and is noisier than other reduced effort stapler,"I was not expecting the entire stapler to be made out of metal but the actual product is almost made entirely out of plastic and rubber. The only metal parts are the carrier, anvil/crimp area and the back of the handle where it arches to the pivot point. That's about it. Everything else is either rubber or plastic. It works okay. My wife has a similar reduced effort product from Staples and it is easier to use and much quieter operating. The Swingline Optima PowerEase makes a loud crack when it staples. I don't expect it to last like other Swingline staplers which are actually made out of metal."
1,swingline,"DO NOT BUY, Purchased 5 optima Powerease, worked good when new but after 5 month of use. in the trash can"
5,Works great,"Effortless, fast stapling at a good price. Only con is that you can't swing the two parts apart from each other in order to staple things to walls."
4,It's ok.,I purchased this for continous use (I work at a retail pharmacy) but this stapler is really heavy. I prefer the Swingline Cordless Rechargeable Silver Electric Stapler (S7048201A) to this one.
5,SWINGLINE OPTIMA POWEREASE,HAD ONE FOR YEARS AND IT FINALLY BROKE. REPLACED BECAUSE IT IS GREAT FOR THICKERSTAPLING. I AM AN ACCOUNTANT AND OFTEN NEED A STRONGER STAPLER THAT IS VERYEASY TO USE. REDUCED EFFORT STAPLER IS EXACTLY THAT. I WOULD BUY AGAIN.
5,Excited by a Stapler?,"When was the last time you got excited by a stapler? I was so impressed, I actually gave these to clients as Christmas presents."
5,Best Stapler Ever!!,"I absolutely LOVE this stapler. It is so easy to use - I have weak wrists (thanks to years of office work) and this stapler is light enough to pick up to staple your paper ""in the air"". The other FANTASTIC feature is that it truly does staple 25 (or more) sheets of paper. Other staplers ""say"" they staple 25 sheets, but jam up when you try to staple 15-20 sheets. I have had a stack of 27-30 papers and it has stapled just fine (all the way through!).I first used this type of stapler at a new job a few years ago, and it was love at first staple. When I recently started with a new company I knew I had to buy one for my new desk.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
1,What a complete piece of junk,Brand new and jams with Swingline staples....I cant get it to staple one single time.....complete piece of junk.
3,Not so good,"The beginning of the game was good - no problem with screen - plenty of light to see each item by and find my way around, and ask questions.Got first assignment from owners - made sense.Got the key, letter, and asked directions - all set to go. Instructions are to go by horse.Then the game gets amnesia. Suddenly Nancy is ready to go for a pleasure ride, and gets ordered by ranch hand to go back inside and get some chores to do, like some naughty girl rather than a guest of the owners.And the ranch hand that gives the chores/orders doesn't give any instructions and warns will get really angry if she makes any mistake. (and game will send home).Nancy went from guest with errand to do for owners to the male ranch hands personal maid. NOT the game for me. (no communication skills, no assertiveness skills; doesn't even make sense)"
3,Not A Review,"I was trying to determine if I wanted to read this book and I couldn't figure out what it was about. Here's the blurb that I got from Ellora Cave's website:By all appearances, wealthy widower Gideon Renaud is an attractive, vibrant man, and an attentive father to his son, Jude, who suffers from a rare disorder that renders him fatally allergic to sunlight. But Gideon has harbored a bloodstained secret for one hundred fifty years--he's a vampire. When he finds himself falling for Kate O'Brien, his son's new home-school tutor, only Gideon knows their passion is a time bomb, one that will end in heartbreak...and possibly death for the young teacher.As Kate finds herself drawn into Gideon and Jude's sinister world, she is forced to confront their extraordinary reality, the existence of the most horrifying evil...and ultimately, the power of love to banish even the darkest shadows."
3,Eh...,"If you are looking for a cheaper version of 50 shades of grey, get this book. That is just basically what it is"
2,what an undulating book!,"I don't understand all the good reviews I read on this book on various review sites...the writing was substandard (something or someone was ""undulating"" every 15 pages) and the story just did not click for me."
1,entre tus brazos,"it's the worst cd i have heard from alejandro fernandez, i think he should go back to singing mariachi music, he is really good at that, he is the best, pop music is not his style, i would not buy it, nor do i recommended to anybody else."
2,The Worst AF cd,This cd is bad. AF vocals did not get any better. The lyrics for the songs are the most simple unimaginative ones I've read. The music of the songs are soo commercial I bet AF would be bored to sing those songs himself. there are good tracks on this cd hence 2 stars. Francisco Cespedes song was a good one as well as the bachata pop one. If you notice closely he is not being himself but rather trying to imitate Christian Castro and Luis Miguel. If you never heard of those artists that's why you will like this cd. other than that NOTHIng new here nor worth shelling out $$ for. Unless you like AF as a physical person of course.
4,Another great album,"I just bought this CD less than a week ago, and already, its one of my favorites. It made me cry, as always happens when I first hear Alejandro's music, because his voice sounds like liquid gold. While I do think that ""Me Estoy Enamorando"" is still the better of the two, mainly because you really hear the full range of his powerful voice, I think this new album has rythyms that are more original and varied. I especially love the passionate, almost tribal beat that is heard in ""Arrepentio"" and catchy tunes in ""Hablame."" I can definitely say that I yet again, I am a very satisfied Alejandro Fernandez fan!"
5,Fabulous,"He is so surprising, that with this new cd, Alejandro shows the world his talent as a brilliant vocal performance. A different style, different rithm, but the same magic touch of his deep voice. He does belong to this new generation of latin singers, but HE IS THE BEST...Luis Miguel is good, very good, but Alejandro has such an angel voice...no comparisson with Enrique Iglesias (is he a singer?)...You got to listen to this cd!....lovable."
4,"Beautiful, but not what I was looking for","While, yes, this book does present ""the multiple colors of Morrocco"", it does not include much architectural photography at all. Colorful cloths, scenic dunes, markets, individual objects, plates of food, landscapes, people in alleyways, in fact just about everything *but* architecture are shown.The photographs are vivid and striking, but given that the ""sample"" pages (Online Reader pages) viewed are almost ALL buildings and yet buildings are minimally presented in the book, I believe that Amazon has misportrayed the contents. I was disappointed."
3,Its nice but not for me,"This was not comfortable for me. It was very thick. My back ended up hurting. It was just too pillowy. Though I suppose this is a matter of personal preference and not the bed covers fault. It was well made. It was thick enough you could have had guests sleep on it on the floor. I ended but selling it on craigslist.If you have a bad mattress you should get a new mattress, I don't know how much this will help."
2,This is not a Cal King,"It turned out that the mattress cover was never a California King Size after all. It was short by atleast 5"". If you have a Cal King bed DO NOT go in for this mattress cover."
2,TOO SHORT,"This featherbed cover seems well made, but the length is about 6 inches too short!! The tag reads the correct size (Cal King), but the product is not sized right."
1,Should have read all the reviews before buying this book,"I should have listened to the 1st review of this book. Whoever transcribed this book must not have had his hearing aide on. The transcriptions are missing notes that you can clearly hear on the CD. It's like the transcriber was trying to simplify the songs rather than transcribe it ""AS RECORDED"". I was very disappointed with this book."
1,not a note for note transcription,"Dissapointing, should have paid more attention to what I was buying in the first place.If someone was transcribing it, then I am sure that they were suffering from substance abuse.Made its way to the bin very quickly."
1,Not at all happy with this.,"I am not a computer novice, and have been installing hardware on my personal computers for years. I cannot get this modem to work. I have an all-in-one printer that serves as a fax machine - but it wastes so much ink I wanted to go completely paperless. What I wanted this modem for was to capture faxes on an office computer that is left on at all times. I have a dedicated fax line - but I cannot get it to work. The directions are far from adequate, and I have not been able to get any customer help from the manufacturer. I feel I wasted not only my money - but way way too much time on this."
5,Modem Works,A modem is a modem. What's great about this one is the bundled fax software. It rivals most pay-to-play software.
2,Not right from the beginning,"This was replacing another bad modem, so when this one would not hang up properly I did not suspect the new modem. It would disconect my computer conection, but wouldn't allow andy phone calls in my home unless I disconected the phone line from the modem. By the time I had time to check everything else, including the phone lines, too much time had passed and returning it would be futile. It was very slow too. I got a US Robotics to replace it, and it is 2X as fast, and everything with the phone line hanging up properly when done works great. Lesson Learned: Don't trust cheap, discount modems."
1,Did not work,"Set up said to install driver BEFORE card installation. After inserting card , then removing card to install drivers, the card was not recognized by Window's XP. After numerous attempts to manually point to the driver.... was not able to get card going... Installing drivers first is DUMB.... don't get this card..."
3,Install problem,"Modem would not install correctly at first. Was necessary to rub the gold connector contacts with a clean pencil eraser, and re-insert into the computer. After that the modem installed, and ran correctly."
1,DOA Modem,The modem never worked but was too cheap to return. It installed okay but would never actually dial out. I found another modem in an old PC in the garage and it worked just fine.
1,Bad experience on install and with tech support,"I bought because of price and description. I am running a WIN7 64-bit system. I followed the install instructions but it would not install. I called tech support. They had me remove the modem hardware and reinstall. Now I get 9 drivers listed in the device manager. The technicain gave me a case number and said someone would call me within 24 hours. After 36 hours, I called again. I was then told they were very busy and they would return my call in 10 minutes. After 2 hours I called again. I was again told they were very busy and they would definitely return my call within 10 minutes. It is now the next day and no call. Support comes out of Southern India and is available 24/7 for the U.S. and Canada. Stay away from Trendnet - questionable product and horrific support. Documentation is marginal at best."
5,The Stars Fell On Henrietta - SoundTrack CD,I received this SoundTrack CD from the classic movie and music composed by the pianist Eric Benoit. I give this CD and Amazon.com service raving reviews (5 Stars) and I'm sure I will continue to purchase!!!
3,NOT BAD,"I thought this was krazy from no limit, but it aint. This album is pretty tight, I would recommend it for the people who like that westcoast/midwest style of rap."
5,roots raggae with a pop sensibility,"This is excellent music, the kind of music you can hear over and over without wearing it out. Beautiful singing, harmonizing, songwriting and grooves. Excellent production. You won't want to skip any tracks. This is some of the best raggae around!"
4,Serving Tray,"I ordered this product for a Christmas gift and when I received it, it was damaged. Didn't appear as though it was damaged in shipping, rather the seller sent it along anyway. I was very disappointed about that, but I think the product looked to be very good quality. Seemed very durable and well made. Too bad I couldn't get a replacement in time to give for the Christmas gift!"
2,Dark and Depressing,"I don't need to go into the plot details. Those have been covered more than sufficiently.The characters are well developed. The language is flowing and formal and authentic. The historical details enrich the story. I love books that have to do with old England, but not this one. It has nothing to do with the hardness of the times, the triumvirate's power hungry mindset or the manifestations of their determination to wipe out every last vestige of sin, no matter how small. I've read other books that deal with that theme.But somehow this one just didn't work for me. And it's not the ending becuase I've read plenty of books with depressing endings. Perhaps it had to do with the madness of Kate Shay, her determination - along with the others who were displaced - to elevate Brigge to some sort of prophet status, viewing him as St. Germanus. At any rate, it was a depressing ending to a depressing book."
2,heavy-handed,"The cover notes for this historical novel indicate that it is a sort of parable for our own time, and that is accurate. It is, however, somewhat self-consciously a parable, and therefore not a very good novel. It's a pity; the author writes well, and appears to know his history, but we get no real historical detail and precious little character development -- just a parable. Don't waste your time."
1,J,The jokers sent me the expansion pack only and told me they didn't have the actual game anymore once I sent it back. Really? aren't you supposed to check before you ship your products? Geez
4,Old School Industrial,"This is a great album for people that are looking for that early industrial sound. Much of my mispent youth was in dark clubs grinding away to bands like Front 242, Nitzer Ebb, and Ministry. This album covers all the songs I remember and more I never knew of."
3,fun toy,it works as described even goes to the bottom of the pool (5 feet).it is one of those toys which also gets taken to the pool from now on...
1,Crappy Bootleg,Amazon should really pull these. I was lucky that the dude that sold me mine took it back (I think he was afraid that I was going to rat him out). DON'T buy these... the new boxed set is much better and not much more expensive.
1,Bootleg Rip Off,This is a bootleg. The pictures are scanned and poorly reprinted. Save your dollars.
4,caught in the act....moving,Caught in the act video is a necessity to understand where the music was inspired. The video is an awesome display of music and understanding of what the band is trying to express in their lyrics. I love how their concert can grab all of the expressions of their songs.
1,SAT Parent,"I bought this solution manual based on the excellent book review hoping this book can help my kid to prepare for the NEW SAT. After I used it, I find out this manual is not good at all. Most of the math quetions, the authors just tackle the problems by guessing. Of course some of the problems you can solve by guessing, I do not have problem with that. However, majority of the math problems can be solve directly. They are ten times easier and quicker if you show students how to do it. Meanwhile students can refresh their math materials. That is all about the education!! I wish you all good luck on NEW SAT, but don't waste money and time on this totally no use manual."
1,Not too useful,"I bought this book, hoping for some definitive answers. But the math explanations were pretty bad, using a lot of text, and very few scribbly diagrams. The reading explanations weren't the best either.The College Board's explanations are terrible too (not this book), and extremely lengthy. As you well know, the College Board claims you can't study for the SAT, so if they were to give good explanations, it would be self-defeating."
3,Looks nicer than it is.,"For the price of the dresser, I should have just gone to an actual furniture store. The dresser took a few hours to put together, and then it was sort of disappointing. One of the drawers doesn't exactly fit. I am using it for a baby nursery and the color matches the crib almost perfectly."
3,Suprised,The color of the wood is outstanding adn was fairly simple to put together I was however very suprised that the entire back of the piece is MDF had I have known that prior to purchase I would not have purchases especially for the amout I spent.
4,Great deal for money,"Although you will need to spend at least 2 hours putting this together, it is a great deal for the money. Have not had any problems with durability."
1,Unless you know how to build one from scratch...,"First, StorkCraft enclosed the wrong assembly directions.After downloading the correct directions online, they BEGAN with the assumption that pieces were already assembled previous to arriving at my door.Honestly, I've been assembling the baby's furniture for the past month, but this mess of parts, screws, and poor direction takes the cake.Unless you have an engineering degree I'd absolutely stay away from this product unless it's pre-assembled."
1,AWEFUL!!!!!,"Absolutely aweful! The construction is part wood and part ""like-wood."" Because of our disappointment we conducted further research on this product and discovered that much of the construction isn't real wood. That sure explains a lot because when my husband was putting it together the ""wood"" was chipping off and literally crumbling in the areas where the screws are. I've never seem such poor quality in my life. Please save yourself the trouble and hassle and DO NOT purchase this product. I don't know how this item passed baby safety standards."
1,Bad purchase,"The side panel on the item came cracked but we didn't notice until after we put it together. Since its impossible to take apart or fit back in the original box, I asked amazon to send us a new box in order to return the defective product. They are unable to so I am stuck as a new mom with a cracked dresser with drawers that only open half way. This thing is to safe for a nursery. Do not buy."
2,Falls Apart After Use,"Initially we LOVED this chest. After about six months though, the drawers started getting stuck, coming off track, for no apparent reason. While we still use it after four years (because of the $$ we paid - can't afford to replace it), we have to repair it and fix the drawers about every 6 months or so, just to keep it usable. Otherwise they become jammed and you can't open them. Do NOT recommend."
4,Great buy,"We bought this for our nursery. I needed something that wasn't too big, but wanted a little character. This works great for what I was looking for. I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but we have had a good experience so far. It did take a little while to put it together, but it wasn't difficult at all. I would recommend this if you are looking for something cute, but don't want to spend a lot."
3,Mixed Feelings,This dresser looks nice and is pretty easy to assemble. However my husband and I felt it should have been made a little better for the price we paid.
1,Dresser,Very cheap product. It is made out of cardboard and you have to assemble it yourself. It chips very easily. And it was in terrible shape when it arrived. Very expensive for the quality. I'm afraid because it looks and feels to be very unsafe for a nursery dresser. I don't recommend it to anyone.
2,didn't meet my expectations,"This dresser is not very well made. The other day I accidentally chipped the veneer finish with my fingernail. The descriptiom claims it has sturdy cam lock construction and the cam locks fall out all the time no matter how much they are tightened down, making the drawer come apart in the corner. For almost $300 I was expecting something more solid and sturdy. This piece of furniture will most likely only make it through one child. It won't be one of the pieces that can be passed down. The stain is also not the same on all of the front of the drawer panels. Some of the drawers are darker than others. On the good side, it wasn't too complicated to put together, the drawers slide easily and it is nice looking even if it's cheap. And just a warning, even though amazon says it is eligble for free shipping it is not. They consider it an oversized item, so that adds on about another $50 to the price."
2,Pretty cheaply made,"Lots of particle board, that may not even be m.d.f. The drawer bottoms are thick cardboard. If I had seen this product in a store, I would have not purchased it. Oh well...live and learn."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!","I purchased this whole set in the cognac color. The 5-drawer chest, 3 drawer dresser combo(with the door) and the matching crib! This is an absolutely beautiful set of very good quality that I continually get compliments on.As with most things you order, it takes some work to put it together, but with a few screwdrivers, a hammer, and a power drill, it's no problem! In fact I did it all myself, and wouldn't let my husband or father help!The customer service is also great. I had one item come in damaged. They immediately sent another via fedex.I highly recommend this set. You won't regret it."
1,DO NOT order this dresser!,"We ordered this dresser to match the Storkcraft Deborah stages crib and changing table (both excellent products). However, this dresser is a piece of crap. We ordered it from Walmart.com in February. It came completely banged up, with parts missing, and other parts not even fitting together properly. We called the company three different times to get replacement parts (they sent us the wrong piece the first time around)... it is now the end of June and we are still waiting on the last piece. The dresser is made of venier, not hardwood like the website claims. It is a different color than the crib and changing table (we ordered the cognac) and doesn't match the rest of the furniture. Definitely not worth the money ..."
1,Do not buy this dresser!,"I have never written a review in my life, but I hate this dresser so much I had to warn other potential victims. FIrst of all, it comes in a million pieces that you then have to assemble. My husband is a carpenter and he was appalled at how difficult it was. As many other's have said it chips so easily. Then the more you use the dresser the more it begins to come lose at all the posts and the railings come unscrewed until the drawers are no longer functional. I emailed the part manufacturer and they advised me to tighten all the posts. After I did that it worked ok for about another week until they all started coming lose again. With a 5 month old baby I simply do not have to time to go and retighten all the posts and rails every two weeks or so, it's ridiculous. On a positive note, I also got the stork craft crib and glider which I am very happy with."
3,Pressure washer pump,I have returned the pump to the supplier for a refund. After speaking with the supplier who told me I can turn the engine around since the pump mounted backwards hoses pointed towards welded plated in the front. I attempted to turn the engine however if it would have worked I would have had to drill new mounting holes.
5,Great Review Book for the Boards.,"If u think reading psychiatry is boring, then please try this book... Awesome book. Covers all the criterias needed by DSM-IV for all the disorders. Very easy to read. I loved it. Helps clearing ur concepts. No other words to describe but fantastically written. I really loved the Psychopharmacology, legal issues section. Go buy this book now. You won't regret it."
4,Good review of key concepts,This book was good for reviewing the key concepts of psych. I think that studying this book and doing lots of practice questions will get you the grade you want on the shelf.
3,First Aid PSY,"The contents of the book is excellent, but description as condition ""very good"" does not matched, book heavenly mark and underline to a point that wasn't difficult at times to read."
3,Not enough,"I'm now an intern, and my worst shelf exam was psych. It was my first one, and I hate psych, but I had read this entire book and it is just not detailed enough to handle the shelf exam. I'd recommend case files."
4,Good Summary,"This book is very good for a review of the essentials topics in psychiatry. It is not sufficient as a stand alone resource for the clerkship, but it is nice and concise for refreshing what you've already learned in greater detail before. High yield. Worth the time and money."
3,Watch out for errors!,"As with ALL of the First Aid books, I've noticed more than an acceptable number of errors and typos. The only value of these books is that they organize facts for quick review. I would not ever rely on them for learning the information the first time around."
5,Carson Daly is soooooo hot,"Hey guys and girls, if you like Carson Daly,well, you're cool! He is soooooo hot, and there is no one like him, at MTV, or in the world! I have met him before (twice) and let me tell you, that boy knows how to dress, and he smells ohhhh so good! And, I also dig the five o'clock shadow that always manages to be on his face! Anyways, Cars rocks, and if you like him, you rock too!"
4,Rear Cover Blurb,"Jane Roberts had married Nicholas Hamilton because she loved him, yet knowing that his only reason for marrying her was that under the terms of his father's will he would be disinherited if he didn't.From such a bad beginning, and with the beautiful Carole Sheridan playing the part of 'the other woman' to the hilt, how could Jane ever hope to make her marriage succeed?"
2,Not Happy!,"After taking the time to listen to all of the CD's, I was extremely disappointed! This was billed to me as information on/or a way to use kinesthesis to know the truth about something. This was the reason that I bought this course. It turned out to be something that I had heard before from others who state that they are enlightened and actually do nothing! If enlightenment is noncaring, then what good is it? The only reason I gave any stars at all is that Nikko shares the practice of chanting the Lotus Sutra on the last CD and that is really excellent!"
1,Google This Guy Before You Buy,"I was looking for a meditation-oriented selection on spirituality, and I got David Hawkins instead. If you believe that all one needs to detrmine truth or falsehood is a tugging contest between acolytes (I'm not making this up-he's selling a sort of kinesiological lie detector) then this fellow is for you. Otherwise, research Dr. Hawkins a little before you waste money like I did. This material has about as much to do with quantum physics as Barnum & Bailey (unless, of course, you subscribe to P.T. Barnum's postulate that there is exactly one sucker born a minute)."
4,pretty good,"I am finicky as hell when it come to buying cd's. I mean that I am not necessarily some kinda rich folk. I took a chance on this particular album and am pleased confess that I STILL own it, after 5 years. Need I say more?Anybody who tells you that it's worth 5 stars must be slobbering though, not to knock their over-enthusiasm, nonetheless the album is worth mentioning."
5,And in this corner...,"The heavy weight Dub champion of the world! Even with so many incredible Dub records back in print, this still has the hardest punch. Listen for yourself and be prepared to be knocked-out.This had a sound all of it's own. This is science fiction for the ears! This was the future in 1983!"
3,average effort,"robert deveraux is my most favorite elizabethan man. i thought this book was good but, i still believe that a BETTER one could be written. i still don't have a clear idea of what made robert ""tick"" so to speak and ""why"" did he do some of the things he did? i wanted this book for my ""elizabethan book collection"" and fits in very nice with the others. i would recommend this book as a starter for someone who wanted to learn about robert deveraux. also some of it is very interesting and full of insight. my only complaint is the author has made some rather mean-spirited comments about sir robert cecil regarding cecil's slight build and hunched back. the author also is suggesting that there is something""evil"" about cecil which,i do not believe and have never heard of this."
3,Acloytes protecting A**es,"Well I write to many good reviews but this....Both guys are a little bit stranged faced, and I miss the old bradshw, not the brood but the black haired acloite. Still this toy was so fun I had to give another good (more fun the less) review to these guys, AND yes thats what APA stood for so don't blow a vien thiking about it.(note:please don't hate me for anything I said in this review)."
5,APA is back!!!!!!!!!,"The APA is the best tag team to ever dominate the WWE. They are so awesome. I was so glad they made the APA: Back in Business. Damn right they are back in business. Besides Brock Lesnar, this may be Jakks best figures ever!!!!!!!!!!"
3,an important book,"The book contains an explaination of a very important area of Jewish religious law, the laws of speech. The book does a yeoman like job in trying to cover these important laws. Unfortunately, the laws are very complex which makes the book a sometimes difficult read."
5,ESSENTIAL READING,"If you're a working Celticist or Proto-Indo-Europeanist, Prof. Barry Cunliffe's books are already on your shelf. If you're considering these fields, studying for them or just have a rooting interest, they should be. Prof. Cunliffe is the top man in the world in these areas. His material is solid and reliable, and on top of that the book makes for good recreational reading. It just doesn't get better."
4,Very readable and thorough,"I am on my second reading of this book as it contains too much info to absorb the first time around. Very good coverage of paleolithic environment and the impact on prehistoric peoples. However, there is virtually no mention of women throughout the entire book. There is almost a complete lack of description of female burials and burial objects, and lack of any attempt to document the role of women in prehistoric times."
1,Should be rated PG!!!,"Beware: In the last movie clip 'Horton hatches the Egg' a fish puts a pistol to his head and shoots himself. I could not believe my eyes! My five year old daughter was terrified and kept asking me ""Why did the fish kill himself, Mommy?' Well, what am I supposed to answer???Unacceptable violence in a little kids movie."
3,It's okay,My daughter wasn't as thrilled with this movie as I thought. There were a few lines that confused her and some that scared her. I'm not sure I would have purchased this movie had I known these two aspects beforehand.
1,Horton Hears a Who,"This was very disappointing to receive the 1960's version rather than the one that came out this year. It did bring back memories though. Of all the DVD's I have purchased from Amazon, I think this one could have been labeled with the pertinent information to avoid my disappointment.Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who (Deluxe Edition)"
1,This SUX,I screwed Up I guess but there was no note to let me know that I was not getting the MOVIE just a Old TV show.... Cant do a 0 star bummer!
5,Horton Hears An Awesome Review,"first off. i bought this dvd after going to see the GLEE live Concert movie. The one i have has the actual animated version of the special.i'd forgotten about how fun to watch Butter Battle Book and Daisy Head Maisy are.I am gladf to have this in my dvd library I intend to, at some point, buy the other two dvds off Dr Seus so i have the whole collection."
3,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who,"So nice to see the original Chuck Jones feature of Horton now available for our children to see. [I'm sure the Jim Carey movie will be fun also] However, the other 3 cartoons are a waste of your life. Horton Hatches the Egg is done by Warner Brothers and it looks like all the commercial stylized cartoons that came out with Bugs Bunny and the like with the same political and social satire thrown in. [one word: camp] Butter Battle Book and Daisy-Head Mayzie look like they were drawn with a pencil and then redrawn by the inkers, very rough and unfinished, very similar to watching an entry in the Animation Festival. Now if someone could explain to me how Horton's Who's and the Grinch's Who's are the same....or what? Does the Grinch live on the spec also?"
1,the book is great but DON'T BUT the DVD,"The cartoon Horton Hears a Who is fine, but also on the DVD is Horton Hatches an Egg. The Book of Horton Hatches an Egg is also a nice story that teaches your kids to keep their word and do what they say. But in the Carton on this DVD there is a scene that's not in the book. When Horton is on the ship, a fish comes out of the water and says ""Now I've seen everything"" then pulls out a gun and puts it to his head and fires the gun and the fish falls back in the water. I don't know about you but I couldn't believe this was in a Dr Seuss story. I went to the Walmart where I bought the DVD and told them and they pulled the DVD off the shelve right then. I will not buy anymore Dr. Seuss DVD, I will only read the books. I only gave this DVD one Star because I had too."
4,keep going,"If you have been doing 1 and 2 or just 2, keep going. This workout is more difficult still. I do prefer the 2nd dvd, but this one is a greater stretch. It is worth getting if you have been doing the series."
5,Review of,"Lionel Richie's latest CD, ""Renaissance,"" serves its title. As reviews indicate, Mr. Richie's CD is being compared to his previous albums. Yet the critics neglect the title...it is entitled ""Renaissance"" for a reason. Clearly, this latest CD is a rebirth of Lionel's style and a resurgence of the subjects of his previous songs. Mr. Richie does an excellent job in exploring a more contemporary fashion while staying true to his ""own"" style of music. In fact, this CD surpasses the skill level of many contemporary artists. This release proves that no matter what style of music Lionel Richie employs, quality melodies will be delivered."
2,He can do this in His SLeep,there was a time when Lionel Richie was as Big Time as any Other Artist&that's cool to a certain extent but Standards are a must not a Passing thing.it's been a while for me since Lionel Richie came out properly.He is a very Important Composer&Artist He was Babyface Before Babyface.but this Album does Him No Justice.if you check out His Older COmmodores Funk you will wonder what Happen?Hsi First Two ALbums are a Must as is His Hits ALbum.Louder than Words had Moments but the Last ALbum&this One are Great for Naps but not Remembering the Great COmposer that gave so much in the past.Skip this&search out His Older Stuff.
3,almost great,well all i can say is got this cd for my wife shes a big fan i listen to the disk while on the bus going somewhere its not his best work but its got three good tracks first is cinderella dont you ever go away and the funky tonight now thats a great song for him it was wrote by rodney jekins he wrote toni braxtons hit WASNT MAN ENOUGH SHOULD HAVE DONE WHOLE DISK IF you WANT BEST DISK GET CAN SLOW DOWN
1,worthless,"I ordered 2 of these, one doesn't work at all. The other one has an A button that sometimes acts a B button."
5,Awesome! Cant stop listing to it!,"This is a great CD if you have been wanting something different and fresh.This CD makes my Spirit want to dance! It is hard not to with a wonderful blend of Celtic tones mixed with a rocky worship feeling of musical freedom. Great lyrics, and the whole album just flows beautifully! I hope they put out many more CDs!"
5,Great read!!!,Shari Low has a wonderful writing style and breathes life into every character. The story was hilarious; I couldn't put the book down.
5,Speed comes at a price,"I use these with the Hybrid Slinky strings. You take the top 3 from the Extra Slinky and bottom 3 from the Hybrid Slinky and poof! Instant Yngwie. Assuming, of course, that you're playing a Fender through a dimed-out Marshall amp. Otherwise the 8 gauge strings sound quite wimpy. Plus you're wasting half of the strings. He gets a special set from Fender, the rest of us have to make our own. Having the 8 gauge really makes your fingers fly!"
1,Junk is junk,"Generally, if you see Pakistan as the origin of ANY bagpipe-related gear, best to just avoid it. I've been a piper more than 30 years and have yet to see anything from that part of the world which was not fit only for display over the fireplace -- or kindling in it. A good chanter reed these days will cost about $10 US; there's no 2 ways around it, and there are any number of reputable piping sources online, all across the US as well as Scotland and Canada. A decent set of pipes will cost in the $1000 range, so if you see a set going for 2 or 3 hundred somewhere -- don't even bother. Even a decent used set is worth in the $600 range --at least. Same with chanters alone -- a good plastic chanter will run about $150, blackwood about $100 more than that. So again, if you are seeing pipe chanters selling for $50 -- yes, it is too good to be true. You will be buying junk."
3,Relativity Described in Layman Terms,"This book contains very basic and outdated descriptions of the universe which is no longer tenable. The author expresses his doubt in the summary page (page 126) that theoretical and experimental development in cosmology may change the ideas conveyed in this book about the universe.Chapters 2-4 give a brief introduction to general relativity in layman terms, and other chapters describe black holes, galaxies, quasars, and the dynamics of the universe. The chapters on quasars and dynamics of universe are outdated in light of new discoveries in cosmology and astrophysics. In spite of these deficiencies the book is readable and relevant ideas of relativity and cosmology are well presented. I recommend reading chapters 1 to 5."

4,Good buy,"My 2-year-old daughter received this as a gift. She loves playing with her baby dolls and these pieces have been good additions. She has the Rose Petal Cottage that goes with them. Though they are made of cardboard/fiberboard they are very strong and durable. She often sits on top of the changing table herself and the items get hauled around the house. There has been no damage or problems with the durability. We've only had them for 3 months, but they've been a very good value so far."
3,baby accessories,This product is a great value. The only thing I didn't really like was the cradle was too small for the baby she had. The baby has to lay with its feet bent. It was a 16 inch baby.
3,Super Cute but Super Small,This is an ADORABLE set however the age it is marketed for is off. We bought this for our 4 yr old daughter and she looms over it. It is much smaller then expected and more suitable for a 2 yr old. Also the changing table does nothing - it should have a drawer or shelving in the bottom instead of empty space. Our daughter also likes to take the changing pad out and pretend it is a bath tub as well.
5,Sturdy and Durable.,"I am a fan of the Rose Cottage line, mainly because of the sturdy construction of their furniture. It is made of thick fiberboard, which is laminated for easy clean up. The plastic parts are thick and durable.This nursery set is adorable. I just wish there was a small set of doors at the bottom of the changing table."
4,Gets the job done,"I purchased this for my 20 month old daughter as a Christmas gift. The product, like all the other Rose Petal Cottage Accessories are durable and the perfect size for her. I love this toy line and better yet, so does she. My only complaint about the ""nursery"" is the lack of play options, I suppose you would call it. It literally is just a box for the changing table and a cradle. It is cute and does match the line but I do wish it had a drawer or shelf, etc to allow more ""play""Overall though, I love this series for the younger toddlers."
4,Good addition to the Rose Petal Cottage,"I purchased this for my niece for her 2nd Birthday. We got her the Rose Petal cottage this past Christmas. Every little play house needs a cradle and changing table. She can really ""play house"" with her dolls now."
5,FABULOUS,Great value. Love the fragrance and silkiness of product. Will definitely re-purchase and will recommend it to family and friends
1,If taste matters then skip this product,I'm an avid gum chewing person who has been trying to switch over to natural sugar free gum. Initially I purchased this product due to the price being cheaper than it's main competitor spry. What a mistake that was. Actually this product is no cheaper after you spend 4.99 on shipping and also count in the additional time you have to wait for the product (4 -5 days) to be delivered. The product tastes great initially but after about 5 minutes of chewing it tastes like crap. It leaves a very nasty after taste in your mouth. I'm forcing myself to chew it so I don't feel like I've wasted my money but it's not worth it. The Spry gum tastes soooooo much better and it lasts. Also I've tasted the variety of Spry flavors and they are all good. So my final recommendation is to save your money on this product if taste matters. If it doesn't matter and cleaning you teeth is the key issue then go right ahead and torture yourself.
2,Disappointing,"This DVD had great reviews especially for doing belly rolls so I bought it hoping to be inspired.Its the worst Bellydance DVD I have bought - Whilst Princess Farhana seems really lovely person and passionate about her dance and has a lovely manner - the quality of DVD is cheap, and the section on belly work very short and not that comprehensive at all.The rest of the DVD is also not that meaty and really a bit cheesy altogether.My preference in style for meaty learning would be Autumn Ward, Jenna, or Leila of Egypt. These are way better if you want to learn"
5,"Tracker, By Tom Brown Jr.","I started reading this story not knowing what to expect, it was not long before I was drawn into the writing with the interest of a Starved Child. The depth and method of presentation was far beyond my wildest expectations.A must read for anyone that has a sincere love of the Natural World, and respect for Mother Earth and all her creatures.Respectfully Kelly J"
3,Unbelievable,"Recollections of childhood collected. The stories contained in this work are poignant, however, I think that they are, as all memories are, tainted. Although I believe that the events are true, the stories contain the embellishments of a boy's imagination. This book reminds me of the daydreams I had as a boy, and some of the stories I could have told. So while the book is an excellent read, and contains powerful themes of friendship, respect for nature, and coming of age, I must say that I find the premise simply Unbelievable."
1,This book started a cult,As a certified wildlife tracker I can assure you that Tom Brown and his books are rubbish. This man started a cult that prays on the feeble.
5,I have given this book to people I love,"This book is full of stories you will never forget - bear smacking? - really! It will make you want to read all of Tom Brown's books and may change your life as it changed mine . . I will never look at the world in the same way and will be a lifelong student of tracking and scouting the. But even if this book does not strike a person that way, I have never found a more enjoyable collection of adventures"
5,Interesting and relevant information for all,All of Tom's books lead the reader to a greaterunderstanding of life and our connection with the creator.
2,Good book....,"This is a good book will provide more inspiration than instruction. You will have a new perspective next time you go into the woods, but you won't be a tracker. It's pretty amazing that a guy who apparently spent his life in the woods, mostly alone, can crank out a well-written book. Then again, maybe it shouldn't be too shocking. It would be pretty easy to dismiss some of the stories in this book as too extreme to be true, but just because the guy doesn't have a PhD doesn't mean he's not incredibly smart and talented.Edit: I edited this review to dock it from 4 to 2 stars and add that you may want to do your own research on the author. I'm not going to change the review above, but I now have serious doubts about the truth of any of this. Stories circulating about this fellow make him and his followers sound like a cult."
1,disappointed,"Just had to put in my 2cents as I'm surprised so many readers gave the book 5 stars.I had read the author's ""how-to"" survival guides as a kid, and enjoyed them immensely. ""The tracker"" had been on my reading list for sometime. I'd finally gotten around to the book this week, but was disappointed as my sense of disbelief grew, page by page. When viewed through the lens of an adult wiith a reasonable amount backcountry experience, I think most readers would recognize the stories as exagerated or downright unprobable. In addition, the writing style/voice is self indulgent.Will be using the book as firestarter this week. Not sure it's worth much else."
1,Monotonous & Boring,"I had to put this book down after 75 pages or so. I was intrigued by the subject matter, and very curious to read it. However, the story includes too much play-by-play accounts of events that happened, without a sense for where the story was going, and without the reflective nuggets one would expect in an autobiographical story. Maybe that comes later in the book, but I didn't have the patience to get through the monotony to get there."
5,Short but Sweet Natalie Cole collection,"I love this collection. Most of the really good stuff that everyone likes is here, such as This Will Be, Mr. Melody (love that scat singing), Our Love, etc. from her mid 70s period. There are a couple of neglected chestnuts form this period that are thankfully included, such as the sad but lovely ""Annie Mae,"" about a teenage runaway Ms. Cole once knew, and the delightfully uptempo ""Stand By Me."" This is a good ecomony-pirced way of getting to know the music of Natalie Cole."
3,"Rather dull, but easy to read","This textbook is not the most thrilling read of a lifetime, but its also not difficult. Somestimes the organization is a little odd, but it could be worse.If its not required, I wouldn't buy it."
1,Still don't have it!!!!!!!!,I ordered this book approx 5 weeks ago for graduate school and I still don't have it!! Classes started 3 weeks ago and I have had to borrow books from other people!!!! Will never order books online again!!!!
2,"Lyrics, vocals? No.","I saw these guys live on tour with Rise Against and either they have the worst sound guy ever or their lead singer cannot articulate worth a damn. I couldn't understand 90% of the the vocals because the lead singer was too throaty with his vocals to discern any words over the screaming guitars. Some of the beats to songs are nice but the lack of understandable lyrics made me dislike their effort.Note to the band, fire your sound guy and put someone in there that can put more decibels for the lead vocal mic."
2,tedious and boring,"I agree with a previous review, that it starts out promisingly enough. But soon, it becomes increasingly boring, with a long list of characters, none of whom I cared about. There is endless detail about the dullest aspects of their lives for a 40 year timespan. In the end I was just so fed up with the main character for being spineless and weak. For example, his business is ruined by an ungrateful stepson,a first wife leaves him with a newborn baby, another stepson commits date rape and he doesn't even raise his voice. I was looking for a light summer read, but just found this to be a waste of my time. Just finished "" Water for Elephants"" which I highly recommend for a very enjoyable summer read."
5,Bird's Eye View into British Aristocracy,"In my opinion, you must trade credulity for an irrestible read. It is doubtful that even a quarter of the events in this book could have happened to one man - also doubtful that such a character would gladly surround himself with children - some not even related. The ending reminded me of ""We'll rent a barn; we'll have a show!"" the answer to all problems in old Judy Garland movies. Having said this, it's still true that if you love glimpses into the lifestyles of the rich and famous, you will find this book impossible to but down. One of the key words should be ""feudal"" - surely this describes Anthony lifestyle at Winchford. All those spare homes in which to deposit friends and illegimate offspring! How delicious! - and the bits with Dita as chatelaine of a grand English county home are fascinating.Buy it and take it on vacation along with the latest ""Hello!"" - you won't be disappointed!"
5,"Not ""slapstick"" or ""satire""..","You know, I've never read anything by Coleridge before (but I do plan to read his backlist now), but I don't THINK this novel is ""slapstick"" or ""satire"" or ""rollicking funny"". I think it's a well-written, enjoyable story.I'm not sure if the editorial reviewers read the same novel that I'm reading now. Good story, though."
4,OKAY!!,I realise I am so late with the review of this book.. Sorry Aamzon.. Where as I buy 99 per cent of my books /kindle from you..Got it from a charity shop.... But all I can say is that though it is not by any stretch of the imagination the best book I have read..and for all his misdemeanors I'm going to miss Anthony tonight ....
1,Ditto,Disappointed again . I have been trying to find software for my Mac 10.7 for my students. the requirements were misleading can't upload to my computer.
4,"Wonderful eye candy, some levels much harder than others","My son loves the game. Unfortunately for some activities he needs help to figure out what to do. Some of the activities are tricky to understand the goal and no explanation is provided (the frog must jump on similar colored lily pads).The game runs fine on my old G4 700mhz - Mac, which is nice."
1,Got a PC? Forget it!!!,"I have a 2 month old high-end Dell PC with tons of memory and disk, running Windows XP Pro. This game doesn't work. Period. First of all, when I installed it, it reset my graphics options. Second, when I attempt to play a game, even at the settings that it chose, I get nothing but a white screen. After numerous tries, and killing the program with the task manager, I finally attempted the other Activities options. Clicking on them does absolutely nothing! It doesn't recognize my mouse clicks.I'm assuming that the game was written for the Apple Mac, and ported to the PC. Trust me, it doesn't work.BTW, we have tons of other kids games and have never had a problem with any of them.Now I have to figure out how to return this silly thing."
1,Tedious game-play with little emphasis on learning,"The problem with this game starts with the introductury movie... it develops slowly, goes on forever, suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play.Once game play FINALLY does start, my child found the games boring and the TRANSITIONS between the games tediously slow. Cute characters...zero edutainment. It was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day."
3,"Cute condensation, some blank spots.","This is the sort of cute little book one finds in the dollar store and picks up just for the heck of it. As a young children's book, it is an excellent condensation of the episode, containing all the pieces relevent to young life. An older reader might miss some of the more calamitous or hilarious parts of the episode that did not make it into the book, but, then, it's not intended for older readers.There are some places where the story is disjointed between pages, but young children tend to fill in these gaps with their own imaginations. Overall, this book is very suited to its purpose."
4,Great sweet breads,"I love this book and its recipe for banana bread is absolutely delicious. Also, it's the first book I've seen with a recipe for prune bread. I personally love prunes and they're so healthy and moist! It made for a yummy bread, not too sweet, dense and moist, great with coffee."
2,Lame History Channel content not worth the price,Bought this based on the stellar reviews. The 3D is lame. Most of it is scientists standing in front of a post that you can tell is behind them. The animation is weak and several of the clips are replayed repeatedly throughout the show. Good content for children maybe but for the asking price - these should be spectacular.
2,Nothing special here.,The hubble is a better 3d buy. this is just like watching the history channel. no special effects really. I was bummed. would not recommend this as a 3d purchase
5,the universe in 3D,"It was fantastic, highly recommed it. Better then I expected,,really great, every one should watch it, buy it now.now, dont wait."
1,came broken,"its a candle, nothing exciting, ours came with the legs broken off which was a bummer. Amazon did refund after I shipped it back."
1,Va Tech Hokie - Don't Buy Any Kinetic Watch,"Mens Arctura Kinetic Watch--After owning my Seiko Men's Kinetic SKH676 watch for ca. 8 - 10 years, it suddenly slowed and stopped running in just one day. Upon searching the internet, I learned that these ""kinetic watches"" don't last without an expensive replacement of the capacitor / rechargeable battery. I sent my watch to Seiko's repair center and learned that the cost to repair would be $76.97 plus $10.50 ship/deliver, an $87.47 total cost -- not including my USPS mail to cost of ca. $8.00 with insurance and delivery confirmation. In summary, operating cost is ca. $100.00 repair for a replacement rechargeable battery in ca. 8 to 10 years. Bottom line recommendation: Buy a regular, non-rechargeable battery-operated watch and spend ca. $5.00 for a new battery every one-to-two years and save money both in the initial price of the watch and subsequent battery replacements (YES, KINETIC WATCHES DO HAVE BATTERIES THAT MUST PERIODICALLY BE REPLACED.)"
3,I thought I'd give it a try.,"Personally, I wasn't knocked-off-my-feet for this one. I found the narrator's voice a little annoying, and I just don't have the time to listen to the entire CD every single day. It is uplifting, though, and I'm sure that if I gave it my all that it would help. The format, however, just wasn't condusive to my lifestyle."
2,Not my favorite Kelly Howell CD,"This is not my favorite Kelly Howell CD. There are 2 tracks -- all music. The music is by Robert Schwimmer, so I feel like it should by a CD by him, not Kelly Howell. ??? The two tracks are very different. I didn't care for the first track, the second one is good, though. The second track is good for doing Reiki sessions with clients. The first track would be okay for background music in a store or office. I can't really recommend this CD."
5,"Great, but be careful not to rip CD to MP3 for iPods","Subliminal CDs like this one are a great tool, but people need to realize they can't rip the CD to create an MP3 for an iPod. Doing so will destroy the subliminal messages because of the distortions resulting from audio compression. This reduces the effectiveness of the CD and could possibly make things worse rather than better. In the case of these Brain Sync CDs, the compression in MP3s may also mangle the subliminal brain wave signals (alpha, theta) woven into the music. I think some of the people posting negative reviews may have converted these CDs into MP3s and as a result, experienced no benefits or negative benefits.If you MUST use your CD on your computer, only use LOSS-LESS audio formats like "".wav"" for best results. Any compressed audio format will destroy some of the hidden information in the audio track."
2,Positive Thinking (Brain Sync audios),"Not what I expected. I purchased a CD of Kelly Howells from Avon a few years back - and she talks to you, helping you to stay focused and get relaxed. But this is just music and maybe some... singing? or a woman singing AAAHHHHH - pleasant, but not what I was thinking. I found my thoughts easily distracted. I prefer someone speaking to help me stay focused."
3,Bad & Good,"I was disappointed in Track 1 of this CD (as well as track 1 of Stress Free Living) where the piano music was way too somber to really relax and enjoy especially if your dealing with stress, anxiety, and depression issue. It reminded me of what I was trying to forget. If there were any subliminals here, they didn't stand a chance of getting through. On the other hand, track 2 of both CDs were beautiful and exactly the mood for which I was looking. Do the track 2s work?; I believe so but it is a long term committment which is good."
1,confused in Kansas City,"I'm confused what the others reviewers see as positive with this CD.The first part is bad piano music, and the second part has a disturbing grating noise all through it. Remember the movie, Contact?I have many of her other CDs, but this was my first purchase of one of her subliminals.I kept trying to get good results, but it was the complete opposite for me.I now won't ever consider buying any of her subliminals.SorryI have 4 of her other CDs that I use often. I had hoped this subliminal CD would be as good, and then my plan was to buy a Stop Smoking CD for a male relative in his mid twenties so he could have a chance at a reasonable life-span.But I know if it is like the positive thinking subliminal,he couldn't tolerate it. He would hate it and it would make him wary of any CDs that may be of actual use.Kelly Howell needs to listen to this product she offers for sale, and fix it or take it off the market."
1,Positive Thinking,"I got this so I could use it to help me start thinking Positive. I put the CD in and I hated the music. It sounds like only piano music. When I shut it off, my husband said THANKS, THAT WAS AWFUL!!!!!!! It was a total waste of my money."
5,Worth Sixty Times Sixpence,"I'm thinking that the reviewer who didn't care for this disc just doesn't understand the music. Fact is, it's got elements of trance (what the kids today are calling techno with few words, repeating melodies, and a constant soft beat). So if you're looking for straight-up rock 'n' roll, this isn't it. What it is is what says: meditative music (not Tibetan, but Christian). Sure, most of the songs do have lyrics, but the instrumental cuts are truly inspired. Get this disc or the mega-three set for revelatory spiritual communion--I'd sell my tickets, but I want to keep this disc. Oh yeah, ""Carry You"" is awesome, with just the right blend of vocals and instruments for such a prayerful piece. God Bless SNTR!P.S. I saw this band in ABQ, NM on 8 Sep 01--they were awesome, and the set they played from their finally (2 yrs late :-( upcoming album ""Divine Discontent"" was great!"
4,really nice music,"None of this music is going to make anyone sit up and take notice, since the big singles on it have been offered elsewhere. But I find it fun to listen to, even if I mostly just use it as background while I'm doing other things. I've always loved listening to good musicians just messing around, and that's really what this is. (Perhaps the best example of that is Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's monster hit ""Beautiful World"", which he recorded as a gift to his niece!) To me the best feature is the variety--and the best track is ""Carry You"", which sticks with me for a while after I listen to it, and builds my faith. I just listened to it while I was folding laundry, and it does grow on me."
5,Another amazing cd from HSB!!!,"Definitely bone crushing cd!! I loved their cd Antigone and just thought how heavy and amazing it was!! than they released Heaven shall burn vs Caliban...and the cd just didnt do anything for me especially compared to Antigone. Than I saw their website for the new release ""Deaf to our prayer"" As soon as I poped the cd in BAM! A really hard loud min exploding cd! Unlike Antigone wich started off with the piano playing!! This is definitely an amazing cd to add tot he collection. These guys deserve to be more well known!! One of my favorite cds by far!!"
1,xXxstraightedgexXx death metal!!!!!!,"Ahh man, Im loving the creativity and originality in this band. Who cares that they ripped off Marduks only good album, who cares that there first demo tape was coincidentially named after Bolt Throwers first album, who cares that a majority of there lyrics revolves around PETA and its PETArrism, this is great man!"
3,"Great Game, But Not a Must-Have","I love Super Mario Bros. 3, but this Gameboy Advance port isn't really a must-have. The only new thing it adds -- extra levels -- is accessible only through the e-Reader, which means anyone who uses a GBA SP can't get the extra levels.And *that* means that those of us who still have Super Mario Bros. 3 on their SNES (yes, I'm revealing my age) don't really need to shell out the money for this game.It's too bad, really ... if anything new had been added to the game, I would've bought it in a hot minute."
3,"Good, but....","Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is a pretty good game. It comes with 2 e-Reader cards, a leaf power-up and an extra level. It sucks that you cant press pause and save during the game and you can't replay levels you've beaten. I personally prefer Super Mario Advance 2 over this."
2,Not as fun as Super Mario Advance 3,"I thought this would be a continuation of the Super Mario Advance 3 GBA game. It appears, however, to preceed that game and in my opinion is a lot less fun. For one thing the characters are much harder to control in this version. The levels are much shorter and the graphics are not nearly as good. If you haven't gotten Super Mario Advance 3, I'd strongly suggest that instead of this."
4,good but hard,it starts out as a very fun and easy gamebut it gets really hard near the endi relly enjoy itthis is the only mario game i have so i can't say how it compares with ohters
3,Could it be the worst?,"Out of all the ""Super Mario Bros"" games I would have this is the worst of them all. Fighting the koopa kids sometime takes about 10-15 times and those airships are just plain dumb. The best parts about this game is the special items you can get like the froggy item. The enimies are the same but some i can't stand ""Micro Goomnbas In Box"" they're just plain stupid and ""Man Eating Cheep-Cheep"" thats just wrong. I would still recomend it but beware you will get mad!"
1,horrrible gaame!,this game is terrible did Nintendo hire George Lopez to make a flying Mario game but he was drunk do not get this extermly horrible game!
2,NOT THE SAME!,"Super Mario Advance 2 is much better! I got Super Mario World 3, thinking that it would be another good Mario game. It's not! Super Mario Advance 2 is a classical, fun, and well-made game. This almost isn't a Mario game. It doesn't have Yoshi in it. Instead of getting the ability to fly by collecting a cape feather, you collect a ""super leaf"" that makes Mario grow a raccoon tail which enables him to fly. I mean, COME ON! Also, you cannot ""spin jump."" With a spin jump, you can kill virtually any enemy in one hit. It's just not the same! Bottom line: avoid this game at all costs. Instead, get Super Mario Advance 2, (A.K.A. Super Mario World) which is worth the money."
3,Sometimes too hard for younger players.,"This game is fun, but, it is hard for some younger players (under 9). There are many different enemies and it is difficult to know when they are going to attack you. Sometimes, they are camoflauged which also makes it hard to defend yourself from them. Overall, I think this game is very hard for some younger players. You probably need to be at least 10 with some good Game Boy experience to handle this game."
5,Super Mario bro.s 3,I purchased this gaem for my 8 yr. old daughters birthday. She loves it! She and my 12 yr. old fight over whose turn it is to play the game.
5,BEST....GAME...EVER,ah. super mario bros. 3. i got this game in the super mario all-stars game. one thing to say. THIS GAME OWNS! IT WOOPS THE BUTS OF GAMES THAT ARE GOOD! LIKE BATTLEFIELD 1942!
4,uuuuuuuu,it was ok.i like war games better.but for not having war it was great!im no video game expert but i think it was perfect!having two games in one is cool!and you can use mario and luigi simultaneously!the grafics are great!i highly recomend this game.
1,Super Who?,Out of all the Mario games this is to be the worst. I mean come on you get in a suit of a frog and racoon? This would be great for little kids from 5 and under. Everyone else stay clear.
4,Excellent Game!,"My son this -""This an excellent game. I am 7 years old and have enjoyed it very much! It's easy and fun.It's one of my favorite games, (...)"
3,"As much as I loved the original,","The translation of this game didn't go over too well. I felt the GBA buttons made playing this game too difficult. I was stuck in level 5 for the longest time (NOTE I've beaten this game many a time on the old NES) and I finally gave up. I'm rating it middling, because the game and idea behind it is still excellent, just this version of it isn't so hot."
5,GORGEOUS,It is a marvelous game I have ever played. It is a first best game in the whole games.If you get it you will be like me.
5,"Super Mario3 Is Not Just Super, It Is Great!","Wowie, Wow, Wow, Wow! Super Mario3 is just great fun for the entire family!"
5,More fun than ever before,"Super Mario Bros. 3 is just as great as when I first tore open the package to the old NES game on my 8th birthday - the music is classic, the graphics are good, the new items were fun, and the difficulty and complexity of the levels are off the charts.*But* what really makes this GBA version special is the new e-Reader support. If you don't have an e-Reader and a Game Boy Player for Gamecube or a buddy with another GBA, this game definitely makes it worth your while to seek those things out. Some of the new levels are really hard and many include items, enemies, and obstacles not seen in the main game of Mario Bros. 3. Plus, you can scan in items not seen in the main game - imagine soaring through the Pipe Maze (World 7) with the cape from Super Mario World!As Nintendo keeps releasing e-Reader expansion packs, the play value you get out of this game will continue to grow! If you own a GBA, you owe it to yourself to play this classic platformer."
3,Not Special,"i played this game more than 10 years agoit was really FUN at that timemy friends and i kept playing itthe gameplay of this new one is the sameIn comparison with modern games, Super Mario Advance 4 is not that special.I recommend little kids who have never played it give it a try.In my mind, Super Mario Advance 1, 2, and 3 are much better than 4.If you like a more complicated game, this one is not for you.Each stage in Super Mario Advance 4 is short.Although there are many stages, you can beat the game in 1 or 2 days if you are good at hard games."
3,Is Nintendo going to come out with any NEW Mario Games,"I love super mario bros. 3 but it's time for Nintendo gameboy advance to release some new games instead of taking old games from NES & SNES. Just a list of some of the games which are not new and put on GBA:Super mario world from SNESSuper mario bros. 2 & Super mario bros NESSuper mario world 2, Yoshi's Island SNESDonkey Kong SNESThose are just a few!and I think it's fair to say that there hasn't been any new amazing games that haven't been already on NES or SNES. Nintendo is making the money bags just rereleasing games instead of making Super mario bros. 4 or Donkey Kong 4. Nothing new! Now it would be alright it they had some, but they really have no new games for the most part. All and all the games are great and it is a great way for the younger crowd that didn't have SNES or NES but give me a break, Nintendo needs to develop some new material."
2,To hard,I personaly was thrilled to get the game but once I started playing it it seemed really hard and it still is frustrating to me. It seems to be getting harder so just be aware that the game is hard and not as easy as you think.
2,This game is kind of hard to play,"I sort of hate this game. That is because all the worlds except Grass Land are hard to beat for me. A lot of my friends beat some of the levels that I did not win yet, and that makes me jealous. I'm supposed to be good at video games, but this one is hard to beat."
3,Ruined,"The People who made this game ruined it. First - they used the Super NES version from ""Super mario all stars"" and did even more enhancing to it (beside the graphics). They made mario talk. That is so annoying. This should have been made into a classic NES series like Super Mario bros. 1 was. The updated graphics aren't bad but it just doesn't make the game the original version"
4,The guide and game,Im getting this weird guide book smell and r u from a smoke free home? The game dose works perfectly on my DS Lite but when I try to use a diffrent save by using the GBA Backup tool it wont work I was trying to make all the E-Reader Leavels appear but instead it deleted it self please help me with the game and what should I do? :( :)
5,really challenging,this game is the most challenging game i've ever played. thats probobly why it's one of the best selling games ever. i haven't even gotten past the first world but i'm still playing it. this game is sure to keep you busy for hours which is a good thing if you don't like to be bored and absolutly love video games. the graphics are a definite ten out of ten and the music is original
5,Very Good!,"I think Super Mario 3 is a great game! It is very fun with cool levels. I think children both boys and girls would enjoy it! The game is not easy, but a little hard. After a while I could complete each level. I am still on World 3, but am happy I'm not completeing level too fast. Also no vilence involed( a good thing)I would say this is the game you should get"
4,Awesome game!,I got this game a few days ago and it is awesome!It's challenging and it's fun!I think it's a great game for all ages!
4,THE ULTIMATE MARIO GAME!!!!!,"This is the worlds greatest mario game!it presents a great deal of challenge while boasting a fun factor.The only problems were 1.the game was way to short.I mean come on only 90 levels of which half i beat the second time i played it. 2.you could only play the same information you saved once. If you saved info then went back to play it but forget to save and turn it off you dont get to go back and play on the same level you were at. the only time it permantly saved is when you beat a mini castle or boss. the best things were probably the suits especially the tanooki suit. with the tanoki suit you could fly,turn to stone or slow down my drop. overal a great game especialy since it was 2 in one!!!"
4,Good pants from rugged material.,"I like the pants, as they were exactly what I had in mind, before ordering. Good color, not faded. Barely shrunk in wash. I would buy another pair, when needed. However, slightly loose/baggy."
3,5.11 tactical pants,Good product but not as good as rival Propper. 5.11 has couple unique pockets but Propper still a better buy stain resistance coating and match belt
5,Very pleased,"I am very pleased with both the item purchased and the prompt shipment. The pants are exactly as pesented in the description and the quality is top notch. I love these cargo pants, and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for this type of pant."
5,Great,I have bought two of these pants and they are great! I will buy theses again and would tell anyone to do the same
5,"Great fit and finish, fits my female shape just fine.","I can't find regular cargo's in the store anymore, and so went elsewhere. I should have gotten these so long ago. They are thicker than I like but feel like they will last. They are true to size although hang low in the crotch. Got 32x30's and they fit true to size. They do run a bit longer than some brands like Old navy cargos. Generous pockets and seems well made. Time will tell. Would order again."
4,Great pair of pants,"Nice and rugged, very good quality. The cotton starts to fade slightly after several washings. I use them for hiking and camping, not for a night out of the town so the fading doesn't bother me in the slightest."
5,Great pants for home or abroad.,"I bought a couple pairs of these pants from the PX when I was deployed and wore them around on R&R. I liked them even more than my ACU pants and decided to buy more when I redeployed, to wear at home and on casual days at my civilian job. These are a great product, I'd recommend them to anyone who likes cargo pants, definitely more functional than jeans with room for wallet, cell phone, keys, without feeling like you're carrying a bunch of junk on your hips. And 5.11's cotton canvas pants are just as rugged as any pair of jeans - a nice heavy, but comfortable material. I prefer these to the loose-fitting Levi's that I always wore for casual situations or for any outdoor/manual work. I highly recommend them, they'll last a long time and it's hard to go back to pants without cargo pockets after you get used to carrying your stuff around in them."
2,Not what they're cracked up to be,"Many of my law enforcement friends have depts that use 5.11 but I've found they're more marketing than superior quality. You can get the same items cheaper from places like Propper or Charles River. Frankly, agencies that use 5.11 are wasting tax payer money on items they could get at much better prices."
2,Not the same as my other pair,"I have the same pair of pants that are the exact same number but are different. These pants are made of that terrible material that collects every little hair/lint/anything on to it and looks terrible. While the other pair that I had before and bought at the store and not through this seller are the exact same number and description but do not collect everything in sight on them. I of course returned them, and will just go to the store to buy the pair I want."
1,Loose fitting,Extremely loose in seat and legs. There's twice as much material as necessary making them feel heavy. The legs are so big you could get them on over ski boots.
5,First Aid for the Medicine clerkship,"The best book I have used in medical so far. Questions I was pimped on during rounds, issues relevent to patient management, weird physical exam findings, strange syndromes (Felty's anyone?)were all covered in this book. I pretty much memorized the whole book, and all my attendings and residents during my medicine clerkship commented that my fund of knowledge was excellent. Everyone gave me honors, and it was literally all because of this book. Probably not adequate enough for the NBME shelf exam however, but combine it with some old kaplan step 2 questions and honoring that should be no sweat either. GET THIS BOOK!"
1,Whats going on.,"Well, I have to say errors. I dont know who fact checked this book but I hope it wasn't a doctor. How many errors can one book have? I am only half way through and I have found at least 10. These are not small spelling or grammer errors. They are errors that could get someone killed. How about coagulation factors all being increased in DIC? or TIBC being decreased in iron def. anemia? The book should be returned to the publisher. My words of advice, read something else if you want to learn something correctly."
2,Not the best choice for medicine clerkship and for USMLE step 2 CK.,"You can read my comparative amazon review of 3 titles - 'Blueprints Medicine', 'First Aid for the Medicine Clerkship', and 'Step-Up to Medicine' - at 'Step-Up to Medicine', ISBN:0781747872"
4,Excellent resource,"This is an excellent resource for your needs in Internal Medicine rotation. It delivers pertinent and well organized information. It also provides ""pearls"" relating to each subject area that bring the information down to practical application. It should not be your only source but definitely will complement the others."
3,decent outline - many factual mistakes,"This book follows the standard first aid format, serving as a decent outline of the material you'll need to know for the medicine clerkship and shelf. It's a great review tool if you already have a grasp of the material. However, it completely skims over underlying concepts focusing on teaching buzzwords and quick associations, so not a great text to use as your primary teaching tool if you want to learn the material in any greater depth than cramming.Additionally, the second edition has a lot of errors, both typos and factual. Some winners include stating that Plasmodium ovale is the cause of Tinea Versicolor (it causes maleria), and telling you to use cefixime for Pseudomonas coverage (use ceftazidime or a 4th generation cephalosporin)"
4,Great for overview,I would recommend this book for a good review but not as the primary source of information.
2,First Aid not enough,"I thought First Aid for Medicine coverage of material was superficial. You have to use other sources to supplement. If you want to get by this book will give you the bare essentials. But to really learn medicine and get honors, I don't think it's a good buy."
3,Too thick!,"The cable works well and it is well made for the price paid but I was surprised to find out the thickness of this cable when it arrived. It's very sturdy but even though for some people this feature had been a good one, for me it was not because I was using the cable to hook up my plasma TV to the power outlet and then hide the cable inside one of those cord covers that was painted the same color of the wall. Well, I was able to barely fit the cables inside (I had 4 cables including this)but with A LOT of work, it would have been easier if the cable was thinner like others I have bought in the past."
5,Serious text for serious students,"This may be a short book but it is serious. It presents cogent arguments for serious consideration by serious students. It is a ""philosophical conversation.""""Our moral duties are determined by us, and so are our reasons. The perfect coincidence of duty and reason explains why it is always rational to do one's duty: our duties, like our reasons, are determined entirely by the ends we select for ourselves."" But ""Why from a rational point of view, am I the only one who counts?""I found it just right to be the ethics text for a course that includes an ethics portion."
1,NOT good!,"Should have read the reviews before ordering this wheelXbox Pro Mini 2 Racing Wheel! It's horrible. The regular hand controller with the toggle is way better than this wheel. It is non responsive. You have to turn the wheel all the way right or all the way left to get the car to turn. There is no feather to it at all. It's either hard right or hard left. NOT good when you're going 140 mph. All I can do is crash off one thing then another. The only good thing about it is it looks like it would be cool. Sorry....wish I could do more than trash the item. Hope I can get my money back! Plus, not the one pictured. Not that it really matters!"
1,"do not buy!! , unless you wanna sell it in a dollar store","very cheap wheel, please spend 20 bucks more and buy the logitech one, but this is going to be my dummy wheel for display purposes."
4,A Great Reference Text,This book is based on Avid Express Pro as of 2004 and will serve you well as a reference text. It is well-indexed and has useful cross-references in the text.
5,Great Pain Relief,"This book is the one to get on Avid Xpress Pro. Being a new user of Xpress, I found myself confused and lost, and often getting a head ache just trying to find a command. James Monohan's book really provides great explanations in bite-size chunks. It is the perfect pain reliever when I get frustrated from the software. Thanks James for such a complete guide!!! Best of all this book has an awesome index."
4,Good Book,"This book is very resourceful. I like the menus by age group. What I would have liked to see is whether or not certain foods/recipes could be frozen. It says on some of them but not all of them. Also, on some veggies I had to add a cup of water and these didn't say to add water. OTher than that it was very informative and Jake (my 7 mo old) loves what I've made so far. Alot cheaper than buying the jars that is for sure! Also the recipes make quite a bit which is good for freezing. I also have Super Baby Foods and I think this one is easier to follow/access."
4,4 out of 5,"I recently purchased this book for ideas for my 6 month only baby girl. It was somewhat informative, but alot of the receipes are very simple. If you are looking for very basic ideas and have no idea how to begin to prepare baby food, this book is a good idea. If you have a good concept of cooking and blending food, this is a waste of time. Good information on nutritional values."
3,Not very pleased,"I bought this book because of the many great 4 star reviews. However, I was disappointed by a few things:1. The age at which the author has babies starting certain foods in inconsistent with what most pediatricians recommend.For example, citrus fruits are considered allergenic but the author has you adding an the juice of an entire lemon to certain recipes for a 6 month old.2. I agree with another reviewer who said there is very little information on freezing and storing the food.I think the author has some great ideas for recipes for 1 year olds but I think it's a bit irresponsible to write recipes that aren't appropriate for smaller babies. This book should have been reviewed by and M.D. Thanks."
4,Looks like a pretty good book,"I haven't tried this cookbook but did read through it. The recipes look rather simple and still flavorful, but there are no pictures, nor does it tell you if each prepared meal can be frozen (like other books I have). I think it's going to be a great reference but probably won't be as popular for me to use as Annabel Karmel's ""Top 100 Baby Purees."" I look forward to giving it a try and think the recipes will probably be tasty."
4,So far so good.,"A few things need adjusting so it isn't too runny, but overall there are some great recipies and good basics. We are just beginning to make month 8 foods."
4,Pretty basic but inspiring,"Most of the recipes in this book are basic, like the Stage 1 foods you can buy in the store. The best part about this is that it gives you proportions of how much of the ingredients to use, how much water, etc. Once the baby gets older, the recipes look a bit more fun and inspiring. My son isi 7 1/2 months now and I'm sure I'll try a few recipes out, but haven't yet."
2,DANGEROUS RECIPES,"Though this book has some interesting recipes, the author clearly knows very little about infant nutrition. Many of the recipes called for citrus and honey along with a few other foods that are NOT to be given to children under the age of 1 under any circumstances. If you plan on purchasing this book make sure you know all of the rules to making homemade baby food inside and out so that you can omit the recipes that are unacceptable."
1,Not for me,"I was excited about this book after reading the reviews, but the excitement ended there. While the layout is nice and accessible and many of the recipes look quite tasty, the nutritional information is off. Many of the recipes include ingredients inappropriate for the age group listed in the book. For example, strawberries, citrus, and cow's milk products are included in recipes for babies under a year, and all of these should be avoided until a baby is older. I don't want to have to weed through and re-think every recipe in the book, especially at this price, so I returned it. I recommendNaturally Healthy First Foods for Baby: The Best Nutrition for the First Year and Beyondinstead."
5,Such a great book!,"I love this recipe book. I started cooking for my first child who is 6-months old. The recipes are simple to follow, the layout of the book is simple to navigate. So great! I would have liked a picture or two, but oh well. Someone gave me a different recipe book as a gift that had alot of pictures and the cover looks great (""The Best Homemade Baby Food on the Planet"") and I don't like it nearly half as much. For example, ""Blender Baby Food"" calls for fresh pumpkin, whereas ""Planet"" called for canned. If I wanted to use canned, I would have just bought jarred baby food!Love, love, love this book. I have already recommended it to several moms. I wish I had the 2nd edition since I'm sure it's just as good."
4,Wonderful Book,"I like this book very much. However, I'd give it 5 stars it had pictures to go with the food and also included baking/steam times instead of all meals made with a sauce pan."
2,Nothing Special,This book has instructions for how to prepare every single food. The only thing is that the instructions for boiling all the different foods are the same so why not just say boil? The combinded ingredient recipies are pretty decent but there is not a lot of them.
2,False advertising,I had been told by one of my girlfriends to get the Super Baby Foods book and thought this one might be complimentary since it was in the catergory and so similar in its advertising of the book. WRONG! This book was aweful and if I hadn't had so much on my plate I would have returned it immediately. NOT worth the $$
5,Blender Baby Food,What a great way to be sure my baby is getting the very best. The recipes are so easy to use and I haven't come across one that he hasn't just loved. The meal plans take out any guesswork.
3,"Great recipes, wish it was a little more accurate though.","A friend introduced me to this book about a month ago and I started making foods for my (at the time) 5 month old. While all the recipes are great and super easy to follow, I wish the estimated yield was a little more accurate. It seems that every single recipe in the book ""makes about 2 cups"" when in actuality not all of them do. Common sense tells me that 2 cups of blueberries boiled down and then pureed is not going to equal 2 cups of baby food. Of the 8 or so purees I've made so far I'd say about 4 of them have come out with the correct amount/consistency. Peas and green beans are either too lumpy or too runny after putting them through a sieve (I've tried different sizes) and my baby won't eat them. Making the spinach was a whole lot of prep work and after blending I only got about 1/2 cup of puree.Great idea and I'll keep using this book, but I wish the recipes were a little more accurate."
2,"Very basic, a waste of money","I never cook and I still found this way too basic and wish I hadn't paid for it. Prior to making my baby's food I had read info online and talked to my Dr so I knew what foods to introduce at specific months. Some of the foods listed in this book don't follow the guidelines that my Dr gave me (my Dr said no corn and to not introduce certain foods to broccoli too early due to gas issues plus some other things the book and my Dr didn't agree on). My major complaint though it the first 58 pages of this book are filled w/recipes that are the same thing but with different single fruits/veggies...2 steps each, boil the food, puree in blender. I already knew that! I was so disappointed to get this book. I had already started pureeing single foods so this was no help to me. Also, everything I have read says it's better to steam fruits and veggies but this book just says to boil everything. I wouldn't buy this, just look up info online!"
1,poor work,"I bought this video when it first came out for $30, and took it home with high expectations. After all, it was produced in the ""Golden Era"" of animation, and was based on the best comic strip ever done. Boy was I disappointed! The animation is flat and lifeless. The characters do nothing but pale, cliched imitations of themselves, and there is NO satire. I taped an episode of The Munsters over it. If you like Lil Abner, get one of the book collections of reprints of the strip. I still think Lil Abner would make a great animated film, if done with the savage wit and gorgeous art featured in the Al Capp original, but even a little kid would be bored by this video."
1,Caution,"My own stupidity but I read the lsiitng as a 4-1/2 pint capacity funnel and not the 4"" 1/2 pint capacity. I ordered it so I would meet my $25.00 free shipping requirement. 3.99 for a teensy funnel like this is an outrageous price. It can probably be purchased for 99 cents at any store. I would spend more than 3.99 to ship it back so I am stuck. Be careful reading the lisitng."
3,Lap Top Desk,Quality of this desk not as expected. It was kind of ticky-tacky. Arrived damaged and light attached did not work.
4,Old school,I've been waiting to listen to this album in like forever. I got the other CD's but I always been trying to find this one. Great album and a good jump off point for the group as a whole!
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM,IMPOSSIBLE TO REVIEW. MY ORDER # IS 002-8127107-0797. I PLACED IT IN FEBRUARY AND HAVE GOTTEN NOWHERE TRYING TO TRACK IT. THE CHARGE HAS BEEN LISTED ON MY DISCOVER CARD STATEMENT.
5,"One of the best X games, sadly is very underated.","Let me start this review by saying I had ABSOLUETLY no problem with the 3-D\2-D system this game had going on, personally I found it very cool. Dont let what people tell you about this game ruin your thoughts.. Like the voice acting was awful -- So what else is new? It's capcom, they suck with voices. That doesnt ruin an amazing game though, there is sub titles unless you just cant read, another thing is people say the 3-D gets really frustrating and can get you killed, theres a simple explanation, those people that complain about that just suck at the game. I found this to be the easiest game in the series, how can you possibly die on the final fight with sigma? I barely even had to move for god's sake! damn that god I dont believen for people being dense! Megaman Legends 2 is the game that had all the problems that people say this game had, there was nothing wrong with X7 at all."
1,"The game was fun, but they turned X into a whiney wimp.","I know they called the game Mega Man X, but they put too much emphasis on X. Those special weapons that you acquire get wasted quick and are not effective when they are the boss' weakness. I love the armors that X has throughout the series, but I have to say, the armor in this game looks like the one from the first one with minor changes for looks and the abilities suck. Zero and Axl can go through the levels, but going through the bosses are going to make you pull your hair out if you have any. Then the voice acting is horrible that you wish you didn't play the game. Overall, if you're a fan, it's going to make you go WTF. Capcom got lazy and didn't think about their loyal fans."
2,Made me want to cry...,"I have been playing Mega Man games since Mega Man 2, and I must say that X7 is the worst of them all. Now, I can't say that it's some kind of abomination to the series, but it's no revolution either. Sure, it's in 3D now, but it's still the same old thing. I have not seen the Mega Man games change very much over the years.Yes, there have been things added, but it really all boils down to ""figure out what weapon works best against which boss and defeat him/her/it"", and that, my friends, is not fun. And, after 15 years, you'd think Capcom would do SOMETHING DIFFERENT. But, no...I love the Blue Bomber, but he needs a new routine, or else, we might see that last of him in this game..."
1,"Why, Capcom... Why?","Never in my life have I wanted to beat an MMX game just to take it back. The control is horrendously tedious and other aspects that made the first six great translate poorly to the PS2. Surely on his 15th birthday of all times should MegaMan have to avoid such lackluster treatment. Believe me, it looks great, but once you've played it, the charm wears thin.In short, should've been great. Isn't."
1,Capcom ran out of gas,An onion being a maverick? what happened to the boss selection screens we used to see where there were bosses we were scared to face first because they looked bad? None of these bosses looked threatening and the weakest looking are actually the hardest...(the kangaroo boss.) Capcom should've kept it 2D and axel has no purpose. The ability to switch between characters takes away from the challenge and megaman sounds like doug funnie. Avoid!
5,Excellent,"I greatly appreciate how fast I received the game, the great condition of the c.d. and also how fun it is to play. Keep up the good work."
4,"Probably the worst of an excelent series, but still good.","This was an extremely fun read except in the times the story began to wander. Then it went down to just fun, but it was still good. I wouldn't suggest reading it without reading the to books that come before this: The Tomb, Conspiracies, and Legacies. Since I am trying to convince you to read others in the series I should define it for you. These are suspense, science fiction, fantasy, mystery with a very dark element to them. And a main Character: Repair Man Jack who fixes problems for people usually in an illegal manor. He has a good heart and really cares for the people he helps, but a violent streak that he is constantly trying to rein in. The books are very gripping. Try The Tomb first."
4,another almost winner,"Wilson has almost done it again..."" All the Rage"" is a very good read. The plot is somewhat determined by the upcoming book ""hosts"" so you know the ending. ( at least you could imagine it ).Other books I would recommend..""The Touch"". ""Sibs"" ""The Tomb"""
5,All the Rage is right!,"This book is appropriately named, it is simply terrific. Wilson has always been a great writer and he gave ficiton readers a blessing by creating Repairman Jack twenty years ago. He is the Harry Potter of bad-assery!"
5,Read Every Repairman Jack,"I am An avid fan of Dr. Wilson's Repairman Jack. What a series....highly readable....edge of your seat page turner. Each title seems to top the last.Try All the rage,and you'll be hooked"
4,Interesting and different!,"These are not literary giants but still fun to read. They are different with a supernatural twist that is kind of fun. I've read two "" Repairman Jack"" books and have enjoyed them both. I plan to order more."
2,2 stars! why?,"i give this game 2 stars! why? well the game has great graphics, and its really fun while bashing people(other riders. But all in all, theres no story to the game! i mean, even fighting games have storys. All you do in this game is race or battle. But theres NO STORY! Theres 7 or 8 race cources, but they are SUPER short. Plus the cotrols are really weird. I, personally would give it zero stars, but its because of the graphics, i give it 2"
4,Kirby Air Ride=&#65533;(&#65533;o&#65533;)&#65533;,"This game rocks to the power of 10!Pros:Who knows how many unlockablesKirby!Simple controlsReplay value=off the scale(or wall, whichever you like)Cons:Um....let me get back to you on that.Overall: Kirby Air Ride rocks!!!!"
1,No thanks,"Let me start off by saying I'm NOT one to completely bash a game/band/movie to death and then walk away, I do try to find at least one thing positive to point out. This game was pretty terrible though in my opinion. It managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about a week. The mini games were the only kinda fun part of this game, and the courses were pretty cool, but the game got boring after a week. There's just not much to do, but hey, that's why I hate almost all racing games."
1,Boring...Too Easy,"This game is for little kids. It is advertised as a one button game for a reason....little kids can play it with their eyes shut. No wonder this game has gotten such bad reviews.City mode okay, the rest just not worth it!"
2,Kirby's Air ride,This game was so lame! This game did not have that much action. all you do is do a few laps around the land on a huge star- thats it!!! and its very hard to get weapons and attack enemies while you're CONSTANTLY MOVING AROUND!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME- SAVE YOUR MONEY INSTEAD!!!
1,Nothing to do really....,It is a complete waste of time; you can not do anthing except for ride carts. That is it.
3,Worth the money.............but doesn't catch my eye,"Kirby air ride hmmmmm. Well The game itself is pretty hard to explain but I can manage it. First off the graphics. Kirby always has been a very colorful well... um how should I say this uh puffball. And his series has been also pretty colorful. Well Nintendo did a good job of showcasing this and the graphics are pretty smooth so I'll give this one to the game graphics- 7/10. Now the gameplay is decent depending on what you like. Air ride is for people who like regular 3-d racing, top ride is for 2-d old school gamers, and city trial is for people who like to collect items and unlockables. The only reason kirby airride lost 2 stars is because the gameplay can get boring after a while , gameplay- 7/10. But believe me I've written worse reviews."
3,Don't play it alone...,"Like another game I reviewed recently (SUPER SMASH BROS.MELEE) this is mildly entertaining on single player but is twice as much fun on multiplayer. But unlike MELEE, the graphics here are fairly bland. There are three different ''modes'' to choose from, ''City Trial'', ''Top Ride'', and ''Airide'', all of which are pretty much the same. There are ''mini games'' after you finish each of these courses, such as ''Beat King Deedde''. Like I said in my title, don't play this one alone."
2,Do NOT be fooled!,"Ok, this might be a good game for young kirby fans, but otherwise......It's basically like any other fast paced unrealistic racing games (not that they're bad, i personally like FX) but the handling of the racing isnt smother or easy, and its almost impossible to get any of the cool weapons on the track. I still haven't mastered the controls completly. But multyplayer's pretty fun, so this is actually a good buy if you dont have any other 2+ games, or for first timers with the gamecube. Especially for the younger kids, IF they have the intelligence to master the controls.Overall, it's a good game, for the younger kids (10 or under) but with anyone else older might be pushing it."
2,I don`t do tittles,"I bought this game because I`m a kirby fan,it`s nothing like the other games he`s in.It`s a bit boring because all you do is fly around on your stupid glider.I`d say you shouldn`t buy it,unless you have two people to play the game so you can race.(I`m an only child)"
4,no story mode,all kirby games have like a story mode but this one doesn't. there is a mode where you cruise around and solve really hard problems if you can. you could unlock all sorts of sweet vehicles and tracks. you could play free ride by yourself and with your friends. kirby air ride is up to 4 players. in multiplayer mode you can solve problems and stuff like in 1 player mode. kirby air ride is really fun to play and is up to 4 players.
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"This game is simple. Too simple. All you do is you steer with the control stick, and boost with the 'A'button. Clearly, it was designed with younger audiences in mind.Kirby can also suck up enemies and copy their ability. The controls for the game are bad, and sometimes unresponsive. There are 3 modes. They are air ride(normal racing),top ride(the camera is above and you are looking down with a bird's eye view),and city trial(go around for a few minutes collecting power ups. Then have a random race or battle after the timer expires). One of them, city trial, has you running around around a virtual city collecting powerups that are pointless for a few minutes. Then you have a random battle against something or dodging something, somewhat like the ones in super monkey ball.This game may satisfy hardcore kirby fans, and younger children, but everyone else, I DO NOT reccomend this game."
2,THE GAME SUCKS,"I thought this game would be cool because it had kirby in it, however this game dissappointed me in many ways. 1. way too easy controlls the whole game is based on one frikin button, you attack, suck in ppl, use brakes, use weapons get off your vehicle, and you boost. All WITH FRIKIN A BUTTON. No offence nintendo but this has got do be the biggest let down ever from you. I mean what the heck were you thinking when you made the game a one button game what the hell.your giving gamecube a bad name. dont buy this game its horrible. Rent it first and youll see. by the way.....................IM RICK JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMES FEMALE DOG!!!"
1,This game is a piece of crap!,"I am sorry but i was incredably dissapointed by this game.I'll admit i'm a kirby fan,but this game sucks!Please i beg you dontplay it,don't look at it,don't buy it,don't rent it,don't even get by it!"
1,REALY BAD GAME,kirby air ride is a pathetic atempt to earn an extra buck! the graphics are ok but the races are waaaaaaaay to easy. stay away from this game or be the victum of KIRBY AIR-IDIS!!! thats the worst ripoff disease ever to hit videogames!!! please heed my warning gamers!!!!!!
3,THE GAME IS GOOD BUT REALLY NOT THE BEST I'VE PLAYED,"I got this game thinking o ok this will be awesome because i've always liked Kirby. Well I put the game in and away I went. I played for like not even an hour and kinda got bored. I got really bored in the free run mode. My 4 year old nephew doesn't even like this game. The thing I do like is the controls are very easy all you use is your analog stick and your A button, can't get any easier than that. Also it is alot better if you have more than 1 player playing. I do like the part of the game is when Kirby sucks up enemies and can use different things so he doesn't slow down and he can defend himself. (Only in the racing mode). The thing I don't like is the tracks you race on are way to short. I like it but..... not the greatest game out there. Great for kids for ages 2 or 3 and want to learn how to play this would be a great game for them to start on.The graphics are really good though. Rent it first before buying."
4,kirby cutie,"Super quick cute race game. ONE OF THE BEST ADORABLE GAMES!Great mommy daughter fun. Buy, Buy, Buy. -these comments areintended for the air ride section."
3,You would be better to get Mario Kart Double Dash or F Zero,"The game is ok, but i would recomend Mario Kart Double Dash or F Zero GX. This game was no stroy or career mode, put neither does Mario Kart Double Dash, but you can compete for trophies in MK:DDThe graphics are decent, but nothing special. The courses are great though. This game does boast of LAN. It's more a of a multiplayer but its still not that fun. It is only for the true Kirby fans out there. I rented Mario Kart Double Dash and Kirbys Air ride for my birthday party and we barly played Kirbys air ride. you might want to give it a rental though, i wouldn't suggest anymore."
4,Buy it or else!!!!!!!!,"There are no true flaws in this game. The one button controls make it very simple to learn how to play and the great amount of unlockable stars(racing carts)make the game play more intense. The three modes, air ride,a battle mode (which I have forgotten the name of),and city trial, are all exciting. In air ride mode up to four players, or a lone racer battling the CPUs, can engage in fast and furious racing action! Players can choose from courses like Checker Knights,Celestial Valley,Lava Flows,Machine Passage and many others. In the battle mode players fight using special items that are spread across the extra small course to help them win 1st place. City Trial mode is a large town area where players can ride fast rails, high ferriswheels,and volcanoes where they fight each other or team up to find the parts of the dragoon and hydra. If you wish to get away from classic race and blow-up games, then Kirby Air Ride is your cup of tea."
2,I didn't like it...,"I rented it for about 1 hour before i took it back. I really thought it was just another boring race game. There was nothing special about it. The graphics were what i expected, not bad, but not SUPERIOR. Not a must buy."
3,taste is just OK,Using powdered sugar with butter and vanilla and milk tastes better and would be cheaper. Would not buy this again.
5,Eastern Idaho,"Love this product! Always order when I use all that I ordered last time. Great product. Use it for cupcakes, cookies and cakes."
4,Very contemporary,"There is something for all levels of knitting - from the easy ones to the difficult ones. The colors and styles are fairly contemporary. There is such a variety that you are sure to find a several that appeal to you. There is very little in the line of instruction, so you best know how to knit before purchasing."
3,Poor book binding,"I bought this book on the recomendation of a friend. I really like the patterns but the book is very poorly bound. After opening it to the pattern I used, the pages in front and behind immediately separated and were loose. My friend had the same experience with her book. Very poor binding. I must spend money to have the book rebound now. I would hesitate to buy another book by this publisher.Carolyn from WI"
1,Climbing Roses pattern has errors,"Perhaps this has been corrected in a subsequent edition. I knitted two afghans and they were great. I got to the climbing Roses on page 82 and was told to cast on 286 stitches. It took forever and the pattern was completely off. Finally after about a foot, I started to look at other patterns and realized that probably I should have cast on 100 less. I am really disappointed that the numbers were not correct and I wonder how many other errors there are in this book! (Lilacs in Bloom on 116 is fine and Royal Luxury on 62 is fine). PS, the book binding is falling apart."
5,Easy Afghans for Knitters,I did not own this one but was excited to see new projects to start on. I received great service.
5,neat,I was impressed by the condition of this book when it arrived. Better that described.The book is so neat to review. hope to do some of the afghans in the future.
2,Rather dry and dull.,"I found this book made a fascinating subject really boring. I had a tough time finnishing it.In all fairness, I learned quite a few interesting things. One of them being that the Greek civilization was not so great after all. This civilization developed great intellect, but no technological innovators. Their technology relied on harnessing the energy of their slaves period. They had no incentive to innovate, that would have caused an idle and restless underclass prone to civil unrest.I am sure there must be another much more interesting book about the same subject."
1,"Nina,oh Nina!?","As I've stated before,in another review of Nina's antics,her association with Adam&Eve,& her other DVDs are crap!They look like copies,of copies,& she only appears for a short time in the film.A real RIP OFF for most fans that know her work!I will return this one,& never purchase her new stuff AGAIN!The best thing to do,is go to DVD Universe,they have a great selection,& cheap.Again don't buy her new stuff,it is apperent she cares nothing for her fans,& just wishes to sell this rehashed crap to people.Go with older cuts of her work,& skip all the hack jobs."
2,Not that good of a DVD,"Guys, there is a point when someone should not be in porn anymore. Nina Hartley is that point, she just has to be in every aspect of this, and it is not very attractive. The video is not that great and it is just a bunch of porn stars, and none of them that good looking."
3,Fascinating topic overcomes less-than-crisp treatment,"The story of how Times Square, and, in particular, 42nd Street, was finally rescued is fascinating, but it's blurred in this treatment. Sagalyn is an academic, and unfortunately, it shows. It reads like a long series of New York Times Arts & Leisure section essays by a critic. All the info is in there, but it's somewhat exhausting to wade through. One suspects the same info could have been delivered more elegantly in half the number of words.Given the rather expensive price, wait to see whether there's a paperback version. But anyone who's interested in the history and development of NYC will find it worthwhile."
4,Healing music,"This CD is meant to be used for the regeneration of the body. Allow the vibration of the music to fill you. You may need to have a more awakened consciousness to connect with this form of music as compared to what ""main stream"" music offers."
2,Exceedingly Enjoyable _ Grimly Limited,"Nintendo's 1080 is a load of fun packed into one small package. When you consider how limited the game is ultimately, you can't help but feel disappointed after only a few days of game play. Nintendo could have really done something special with this game, and with the amount of time it took for the pioneer of video games (Nintendo) to release it, you'd think there'd be much more.The graphics of 1080 are superb, and the controls are smooth and fantastic, but the characters and levels/stages seem grimly limited. I loved playing this game. I found myself begging for more. The music element of 1080 was impressive, but that wasn't enough to make up for the lack of greatness it could have been. I'm dumbfounded by Nintendo's lack of effort towards 1080 and the overall product release. If Nintendo was frustrated with the lack of sales this game produced, they should have given this game what it really deserved. It deserved MORE."
1,Not a good follow up.,"If you really liked the original 1080 than forget it. At first it feels a little bit like what you remember, and then leaves you fealing bored in your video game soul. Go play the Amped series instead."
2,Mediocracy at its Height,"1080 for N64 was a phenomenal game with so much to offer. I purchased this game because I love snowboarding games, a love that began with the original. This game lacks the originality, seamless flow, and apparent intuition of the original. If you are looking for a solid snowboarding game with good controls and attainable objectives, stick with SSX Tricky or SSX 3 which are the best two snowboarding games I have played (the newest SSX, ""On Tour"" being a total letdown). I am glad I didn't buy this right when it came out when it cost $60; I bought it for $15 new, which was still paying too much."
4,this game is pretty cool,this game is awsome it has five hidden charactors and beats the original by far buy it.
3,Lacking...,"1080 Avalanche is definately a fun game in the sense of speed, but it comes to an overall game, such as tricks and custimization, buy SSX3!Control: 3/5Im sorry, but I have to have big air and tricks. The way I see it, if I can't pull of awesome combos, things are bad. But, the system where you can get back on balance if you mess up a jump is cool.Sound: 5/5The reason Sound gets 5? I LOVE THE SOUNDTRACK. The song ""Choke"" is amazing, and is really something that you could snowboard to. The sound of the snow under the board is crisp as well.Modes and Extras: 2/5The Match Race is pretty much the only thing worth it, and even that isn't very good. The characters are limited, the boards are limited, and there isn't really any customization or unlockables.Overall: 3/5The game is cool if you like speed, but the tricks suck and you can only hold a jump for 2 seconds. I reccomend you buy SSX3 instead of this, or you can buy this too. Whatever floats your boat!"
4,Good but not SSX3,"I rented this title but would not purchase until it is much cheaper. This is because SSX3 is likely to be a much better title for the money. The reasons in my opinion are first that the courses are far too short on 1080 as well as being too few of them. The control is not as smooth as SSX3 but really this is just a preference and gives a different feel to the game. 1080 is quite beautiful in appearance and fun to play although I can't say how long it will hold my interest simply because the courses are too short. Finally, there are some ""bugs"" in this title that I have already noticed in a single day of playing. The camera view on certain courses inexplicably changes without user intervention. At first I thought it was me but after paying close attention a few times through the same run I noticed it always happened at the same place in the run. Its possible this is by design but I doubt it as it hinders you and I always immediately reset the view to where I had it."
5,an awesome game what else can I say?,I like to play games and I play like it is my job! I enjoy this one every time. The graphic and overall quality is great. Not a waste of money. Game came faster than I expected too! Now I have to go to play it again bye.
5,sheep: small-scale sheep keeping for pleasure and profit,"I have read alot of books on sheep for years, because I own sheep and what to do my best at it. This book was probably the best book on sheep I have ever read. The information was great and easy to understand this book is right on. I have told alot of sheep people I know to get this book"
4,A lot of info in concise form!,"I bought this book in hopes of having a ""catch all"" reference for our new adventures as shepherds. The book is packed with information in an easy to read format. I will still have to supplement the book with other publications, but it does cover the basics and would serve as a beginner's manual. One thing we have begun doing recently is printing off extension publications and compiling them in a 3 ring binder, arranged by topic. This book is easy to read and would be a good reference for 4H students."
2,"Sheep, small scale sheep","This is verrrrrrry basic stuff. If you are raising sheep in New England like we have been doing for 25 years, you read everything, but everything does not apply. Seek out people in your area who have been doing it for a long time, and get a breed that you like along with something local. And if you have never had sheep before, read other books than this one, and by all means get a couple of fixed rams! This book is sort of to folksy for us, and fake down homesy. We have no pets here, just critters that share our lives! If the wethers do not work out, you can always freeze them! Do not let people tell you sheep are stupid...they are just visual thinkers!"
5,An Angelic Read,"After reading Where Angels Tread, I was very impressed with how engaging the story was. Right from the beginning I was hooked and wanted to know what was going to happen to the small church community and all of its struggles, political and personal. There were several unexpected twists and turns that left me full of emotion and I found myself unable to put the book down! The depictions of the characters and story line were very easy to visualize; I almost felt like I knew the characters. Anthony Ducklow's story really made me believe that miracles can happen, even when we are full of despair. He did a great job of depicting the Angels in the story as well. The book was such a fast, enjoyable read that I almost felt sad when I had finished it. I highly recommend it!"
5,Enlightening,"As a ""recovering catholic"" who has had my own disillusionments about the church, I found this book as a ""road back"" to what the church is really about. The fictional depiction of Jesus dying for our sins hit home as to the magnitude of what the son of God did for us.The book was easy to read, and as one reviewer already commented, hard to put down."
1,Painting not Picture Poster like other posters of Lindsay,"I would warn all potential customers of this print of beautiful and voluptuous Lindsay Lohan that what you receive is not a picture like the ""people poster"" but instead something blurry looking more like a painting. It destroys the poster and makes Lindsay look terrible. What is needed is a photo shot to expose Lindsay's beautiful and sexy body."
4,Remixes are sometimes better than the originals.....,"I love this album and have for many years. The remixed versions of ""Uhh Ahh,"" ""Hey Lover,"" and ""I'll Make Love to You"" are worth buying the whole CD for. Much better than the originals if you are a true R&B fan. It shows a much more 'adult' side of the group."
4,Perfect for Chinese learners of English,This dictionary is a great compliment in an ESL class. It's intended audience is the Chinese student of English. The variety of subjects and American life in general is good. It's a great source for vocabulary and a conversation starter.
4,Great for Teaching EFL,"I used this book extensively while teaching college level EFL in the Peoples Republic of China. It was very helpful in identifying words like ""blender""; the pictures taught a lot about how a house actually looked in the USA. Students poured over the book before and after class. Ah -- but I wish it contained the pinyin so I could have used it to learn Chinese!"
1,Consider Yourself Warned,"Remember ----- this book only has traditional characters. It doesn't use the simplified modern form of written chinese. If you are a native english speaker learning chinese as a foreign language, this book will be of little or no use to you, unless you prefer chinese in its old form.Another thing to keep in mind: the five star reviews for this book are being done largely and almost exclusively by native chinese speakers who are learning english as a foreign language, or the reviews are written by people teaching english as a foreign language.I find it hard to believe this book will be of much use to the vast, larger majority of students learning chinese."
3,"Good for ESL students, Bad for Chinese students","This is a bad thing for anyone learning Chinese because IT DOESNT HAVE PINYIN. BE WARNED.However, ESL students will love this thing because of the pictures and the English.However, IT IS WORTHLESS for AMERICANS LEARNING CHINESE."
3,"So, who's the real bad guy?","Liked the product, overall: An evil Disney world in the alternate CSA. There are two inherent problems with this. First, the park is too small, it seems like a third-rate carnival. This needed to be a box-set or a full size book, not a wimpy dime novel. Second, when the PCs defeat Dempsey Wilton, it is revealed that some other force is behind the park's evil. Hellstromme (who sold dempsey the automatons) is off in space, so which of the big villians is behind it? Devlin? Grimme? Stone? The authors should have at least hinted to the GM."
2,Clowns are so...DONE!,"Who was it that decided that clowns were scary? This is one phobia that I can honestly say that I've never possessed. I equate it with guys who wear an earring or turn their baseball caps backwards to show how cool they are. Wanna be spooky? Send in the clowns! As far as I'm concerned, once you've brought out the evil clowns, you've run out of ideas. ""Killer Clowns"" does, indeed, keep up the Deadlands tradition of gritty writing and opportunities for epic heroism because the evil one faces is EXTREMELY evil, and that's why it's getting two stars from me, but honestly, can't we come up with something besides clowns to be afraid of? You know, every once in a while, you need a NON-supernatural adventure to throw the Posse off guard, and if you've got a choice between running ""Killer Clowns"" and just having them fight a generic Mad Max type cycle gang, give me choice B every time."
2,NOT what I expected,I love pokemon and video games (even though I am a girl) and I was so happy when this came out. I begged 4 it 4 Christmas from my grandpa but when I got it I was dissapointed. See the graphics r sweet and the poke dex (or how ever you spell it) is awsome cause u can see all the pokemon you catch but the game is kinda boring. See all you do is play you get it in the whale or birds' mouth then you can catch pokemon by hitting these glob things on top. Yah it does'nt sound so fun huh? My brother and my dad end up playing it. I guess it's more of a boy game in my opian. But it is pretty cool that it's ruby and sapphire!
3,It's ok,This is a sorta ok game. But I think I was jepted. They charged me 26 dollars for this thing. C'mon I don't think it's worth that much. Overall it's ok.
4,One of the best games of the year!,"I bought this game hearing it was too easy and doesn't keep you hooked. Well, I'll just tell you that this game is definently worth it. It has 7 bonus stages which once you get the hang of them they are easy. It is very difficult to get 1,000,000,000 points(unlike the old version). The game includes the challenge of getting 200 pokemon which is difficult. In total, the game is great but to catch a pokemon you only hit the bumpers 3 times and the pokemon 3 times. The old version made it where you hit the bumpers 6 times and the pokemon 4. There some other take-aways that bother me too but... Sound is the worst but otherwise the game is great!"
1,Not fun,"This game is really boring. Whats the whole point of playing pinball with pokemon. I mean, you would just hit a ball and the pokemon getting hurt. And then you would be like, ""Why the heck did I buy this piece of junk?"" So you wasted money. Also, the first pinball was better. It came with a rumble pack and this one doesn'tKelly Park"
3,Must Like Pinball,"This game is fun for someone who likes Pokemon AND pinball.But if you are just buying it beacuse you are obbsessed with pokemon, prepare to b dissapointed. You must actully like pinball to play this game."
3,Buy it cheep or don't buy it!,This game is worth buying if you can find it under $10. This game is a very good game for pinball and pokemon fans alike. There is realy no real point in this game so even if you find all the pokemon you can still have fun playing. If you read this review and you say what the #@%! is he talking about I would never buy that I don't blame you it is NOT that great of a game. If your like me you will play it a lot for the first week and play it less and less and finaly stop playing it. If you are looking for a pokemon RPG this is not your game. I realy do not know much about pokemon (I got the game as a gift I never would have bought it) If you don't like pokemon you can still enjoy it but pinball haters (like me) wouldn't enjoy it. I gave it 3 stars because if your not a realy big pokemon fan you will not like it that much.
2,Halloween Night Haunted House,"Boring....not enough special effects like screaming, spooky voices, howls, thunder, etc.. Music is pretty cool though but it can put you to sleep. There is no other CD like ""A Night in a Graveyard/A Night in a Haunted House"" (1987) by Symphonies Dist.Once again, big disappointment and wasted money as you cannot return opened CDs!"
5,Great for the halloween home!,"I have had this cd for a few years now, and the kids love it for the haunted house we have! It has always been all of our favorite!"
5,Cultural interpretation of ancient Hebrew narratives,"Ferdinand Deist's The Material Culture Of The Bible offers a scholarly discussion and exploration of the theoretical and practical implications that language and literature have to offer a sound cultural anthropological perspective of ancient Israelite society. The reader is furnished with practical examples of cultural interpretation of ancient Hebrew narratives, as well as informative assessments of the impact ""cultural relativity"" and ""inter-cultural communications"" has upon biblical interpretation. The Material Culture Of The Bible is an academically sound, superbly presented, highly informative contribution to biblical and anthropological studies."
1,claims to be balanced but doesn't seem to be,"Hello, I am a doula preparing to support a mother who is trying for a VBAC. I picked up several VBAC books from the library. This one has made me feel very uncomfortable. It seems to be an advertisement for repeat cesarean while simultaneously claiming to be fair and balanced. The anti-VBAC tone makes me wonder whether the statistics and information presented are accurate. I wouldn't recommend this book to a mother who wants a VBAC. I understand that not all women want a VBAC, and that there are pros and cons to trying for one, especially after a traumatic first birth, but I think there are other books that address these concerns in a more balanced way without making women feel afraid of VBAC as this one does."
4,"A little dry in places, but very helpful","I found the first half of the book a bit dry and technical at times, being it is replete with a lot of medical facts. I did read the entire thing, however, and I'm so glad I did. The second half is an analysis of 50 women who tried VBACS, or had repeat cesareans and their feelings about both.This book really is helpful with giving you pointers on how to find a compatible care-giver and how to get what you really want (as well as how to figure out what that is)."
1,I'd give it zero stars if it were an option.,"A great read if you just want to be scared into a repeat c/s. This book is promoted as unbiased, but that is SO far from true!! I've also been reading the Cohen and Korte books, and Kaufmann's bias comes through loud and clear. Don't waste your time reading if you are even remotely interested in a VBAC."
1,Don't waste your money on this book.,"Kaufmann is a disgruntled author who was forced to have a VBAC by her OB. Besides the fact that her delivery is very dry, she doesn't give the fair and balanced look at c-section and VBAC that she promises. Korte and Flamm have both written wonderful books on the subject that are much more informative and contain information from studies done from the 1950'sto the present. If you're serious about VBAC--and there's no reason why you shouldn't be--please don't read this book. It will just make you doubt your body's ability to perform this beautiful, natural miracle because of the unbalanced information it contains. Good luck with your VBAC!"
5,Unbiased and RECENT facts & statistics,"This book provides the first unbiased look at VBAC that I have read. Most books are geared toward one main function....to make any woman who doesn't feel she's a candidate for VBAC feel like a failure and worthless. This book provides statistics and facts that most ""blindly supportive"" VBAC books refuse to print. The truth hurts their cause. I definitely encourage women who have any doubts to read this book. The statistics that are presented are RECENT, which most books like The Silent Knife cannot boast"
2,I am uncomfortable with this book!,I was very uncomfortable with the information presented in this book and would not recommend it to any of my VBAC couples. I believe the author's research was slanted and unsubstantiated. VBAC couples need support and the most up to date information. I would also like to recommend Natural Childbirth After Cesarean by Crawford and Walters. I love that book!!! Good practical information
1,"Should be called ""Why You Should Have Anyother C-Sec""","It doesn't really list any benefits to VBAC's, only risks. The research is outdated given it is old. It really tells you why you should have another C-section instead of VBAC. If you want to have a VBAC or is considering one, this book is not for you. If you want another C-section, it's the perfect book for you."
4,One of the better choices I've seen on the topic,"I'm considering a VBAC and I like this book--I say this after reading many books from various vantage points on the subject. This book is not alarmist, and does not smack of conspiracy theories like some of the others. It isn't a pro-VBAC polemic, but it does lay out many of the realities of birth in the modern world. The best thing it does for me is provide the beginnings of a roadmap for an informed and conscious birth within a medical setting, which is a realistic and noble goal. The tone of this book is positive, and unlike many of the books on the subject does not demean or treat paternalistically those who would choose a different path than their authors.I didn't give it five stars because the writing could have been a bit less dry and I would have liked to hear more of the birth stories of the women interviewed for the book."
1,skip this book,"This book offers none of the available solutions to the risks that are sighted.There are solutions, managments, and couses of actions to protect yourself, and this book does not do a good job in presenting them."
5,excellent transaction,"Quick shipping, solid service. I have no complaints. Product as described. Unopened as of yet, so I'm assuming all discs are in working condition."
5,boy meets world ssn 7,Awesome love this show! All seven seasons are great! Buy them all if you can! Today's tv just doesn't have good sitcoms like this.
1,Seriously?,"If someone gave me this, I would have to cut them. Who wants this? There is one good thing, the picture of them is effing funny as hell. You can tell they know it's the worst decison of their life and ruined both of their lousy careers."
2,Don't waiste your time.,I think this game is so boring. It's more like a computer game. You can't even run around to get guys. Graphics are good. That's the only good thing I can say for it. I'm 11 years old.
5,Amazingly Playable!,"I bought this game and absolutely love it! I played the original on the Amiga, and this new version is very much in keeping with it, yet has come on a long way. All of the mini-games look and feel excellent. Your first exposure to them is an archery raid, which is SO addictive! You'll end up playing it again and again until you can master it and kill all the riders before you get hit yourself.The cut-scenes are also astounding. I've never seen such attention to detail and atmosphere put into in-game movies before. And there's so many of them!Most people seem to assume this is a game about archery, swordfighting, jousting etc. But there's such a big strategy game behind it, with a map of England (and Sherwood Forest) that you attempt to take-over county by county. It's up there with the Sid Meier classics.This is a great game. I can't stop playing it. I'm off to kick the Sheriff's ass!"
1,Don't bother !,"I loved ""conversations with my agent "" but this is a tedious read that has been padded out to book length ."
1,Extreme disappointment,"I ordered this toy for my 4 year old grandson. The first one arrived and it was defective. The valve leaked and the rocket could not launch. Then I ordered a replacement and the replacement was just as defective as the first one. It looked like such a wonderful toy for an active little boy, but wound up being one big disappointment and nuisance with handling the two returns. DO NOT BUY THIS I had to rate this item and it really should be rated 0 instead of one star"
1,Bummer,"This looks so much cooler than it is.It never worked for us. The air wouldn't get to the rocket. There was clearly a piece shaking around in the base that was broken.I know it looks cool, don't waste your time and money."
1,Just looks cool,"It worked for the 1st 5 minutes, but after that it broke. You pump and pump and when you hit the button all the air fizzes out and the rocket goes nowhere! I loved it at first because my 3 year old son could operate it (with adult supervision).....the rocket flies high and you have to make sure there aren't any faces in the way. He still loved making the rocket fly with his own arms so I guess it wasn't a total waste!"
4,"Great! But, some issues...",First would pump but not fire...They sent me a new one but it wouldn't pump...Combined parts from the two sets and got it working!It really is a great toy (once you get a working one.)One thing I did figure out is that the base has to be levelfor it to fire. It seems there's a marble or something in itthat has to be in the right spot. I imagine it some kindof safety feature...
1,RIP OFF!!!!,This toy worked for under 5 minutes before it leaked air at the launch button!! Absolutely no way to fix it!! My son was devastaed!!
2,A Sordid affair,"This book makes a mockery of the issues modern day women face. It is told from the point of view of a woman character but actually written by a male so needless to say it is far from an authentic portrayal of a thirty year old woman facing the issues of career, family and marriage. It is definitely Rated R if not XXX for the sordid language and sexual content. I didn't finish the book...didn't want to warp my mind with it. I'm sure this author is better off sticking to his usual genre and best leave chick lit to being written by the female ilk."
1,Stinky and Cheapo.,The plastic used in this has a strong smell that I would not want in my car! And it just looked cheapo. Plus it had velcro on the bottom which would have scratched the leather! Don't buy this.
2,Not what I expected,"I wish this product were a little studier in the upright position part. It keeps collapsing on me. Also, when I received it from the seller it was a little dirty. I wish I had noticed that sooner, but it was on one side and I just didn't see it.If didn't collapse so easily whenever you lean something against it, then I would recommend it, but so far, no."
2,disappointed,"My 3 year old daughter loves drawing on her magna doodle, we have also had other such toys which have all worked excellently. She also enjoys Barbie and pink so I thought this would be a perfect choice. It didn't turn out so great though. Firstly it broke in about ten seconds, we eventually unscrewed the back and reattached the magnetic strip which had come unstuck. Then I realised that if your left handed the cord which attaches to the pen is too short to draw comfortably. Also the little magnets that sit along the side fall out everytime my daughter carries it by the handle. So those are already history. I would recommend you invest in the old faithful Fisher Price Magna Doodle instead."
2,Great toy ... but not durable,My daughter had lots of fun with the barbie doodle. She only played with it for only a few times until the toy broke. The sliding eraser doesn't work.
1,The Eraser keeps breaking off,"I am surprised some say the durability is excellent. We bought one and within 15 min. the eraser detatched, so I returned it and the first time we tried to use the next one,we had the same problem. I am affraid to purchase another Doodle Pro item after experiencing this one."
1,What happened???!!,"I can't believe this is Mxpx! I used to love this band when I was growing up. They were the first band that got me into punk music in general. Now they are just ""pop"" and sound like every other band on the radio. It's really emberassing to even admit that I used to like them after they became so ""unpunk"". I'll give them credit for keeping clean lyrics, but otherwise the only good cd's are anything prior to ""The Ever Passing Moment""."
2,Too bland,"This is the worst MxPx album to date. There are a few ok songs on this cd but that's not nearly enough. Ever Passing Moment showed that MxPx was headed towards a more melodic, mature sound.....well guess what, this cd is not melodic and it does not have a mature sound. The thing that I hate about this cd the most is not that it is poppy, but the fact that it's not even catchy?? I mean if you're going to write pop-punk you should at least make it catchy."
1,zero,"God i hate to say it but this is the worst mxpx album ever. I am an old school fan and ive been able to admire and appreciate the change of their sound over the years. I mean i think i'm the last of my friends to still like this band. This album is sellout garbage. Even the ever passing moment had more bite than this. Reminds me of waterdown blink 182 or good charlotte (bands i could do without.)It's just not good and im selling this back. ""Play it loud "" is ok the rest are rubbish. Is Green Day the only decent pop-punk still able to put out good music? This is the cleanest that Mxpx has ever sounded. It's just dissapointing. if your curious about mxpx but any album aside from this one."
1,what...happenend?,"i thought i would never give mxpx a bad rating, and i never thought they could ever come out with a bad cd. i gave them a one because i know they can do much better. sorry guys."
4,Good but a little poppy,"I think that this CD is pretty good. I will say it is a little more poppy than the the previous CD's (hence the 4 stars) but it is NOT G.C. or simple plan, its way better than that. It reminds me a lot of the CD before this, Ever Passing Moment, so if that was one of your favorite you will like this one."
5,A GREAT NEW SOUND,"The new cd has a whole new sound for MxPx. It still rocks but is a lot differant from ""life in general"" and ""teenage politcs"" and all their other great cd's I would definitEly recomend buying it, and it's at a new low price! MxPx is definitEly one of the best bands, and most definitely the best live band, i recomend you go see them live."
4,Another Awesome One By MxPx!,Great album. I enjoyed the new sounds mixed with the old in this one. Each track is very great and I recommend it to anyone who is into the pop-punk stuff.
4,you are all a bunch of morons.,"this cd is good. you are all a bunch whining babies who expect bands to stay the same forever. grow up. ok, so the new pop-punk genre is taking over the world...who cares? stop listening to music based on style and genre and listen to it because it's good music. every single person who has said anything bad about this cd is just pissed off because their ""favorite band"" has turned into ""good charlotte's twin brother"". you all need to open your minds and stop being so childish. I've been listening to Green Day since I was 12, and they have changed tremendously since then (I'm 18 now). does that mean they still don't write good music? no. as a musician I can personally testify (ESPECIALLY) with punk music, that you always end up stuck writing the same crap twice. artists need to evolve. stop whining and buy the cd. it's worth it."
4,A Reflection,"Those who complain this new album to good Charlotte or newfoundglory, must've not taken the review seriously.While i admit, this album is more polished, some might like that some might not. Some might want it to be more Christian or Less Christian regardless, these guys have Faith are playing their hearts, which i must applaud. Because of recent Marriage in the band, the songs reflect how they feel about the subject.Way to go guys, keep doing what you do best."
4,"some really good, some ok.","If you like previous MXPX CD's, it is safe to say that you'll like this one as well. It is a bit trendy, but there are some really good catchy songs on this CD. I have all of thier CD's and aside from ""10 years"", this is probably my favorite. If your more into hard core punk, this will CD will probably not work for you. Most of the songs work for me and that is all that really matters."
2,Im just not into this New MXPX stuff,Yep another horrible cd by mxpx thanks to A&M records! I gave 2 stars instead of one because these guys were tremendous in the past that i still have respect for these guys whether i like their new stuff or not but this is not one of those cds i tend to like
5,Kick ass!!,"This has to be one of the best cd's I own. The best songs on the cd has to be: Play it Loud, Well Ajusted, and Everything Sucks (When Your Gone). If u don't buy this cd, you can no longer call yourself a punk!"
5,Hey People of the World!!!,"Alright everybody, MXPX's new album ""Before Everything & After"" is so awesomely awesome!! It's a total new approach to music and emotions taken by the guys. If you haven't considered listening to it or buying it, you should, especially if you're a lost MXPX fan, well all I can say to those of you that are lost, it's time to be found, and with this album you can be!!! Go MXPX!!!!!"
5,This is the best cd I have bought lately,"Okay this is a great cd. I have listened to it at least 1000 times. So if you arent sure if you should buy this cd go for it, I am one of their biggest fans so go out and buy it."
4,Maybe the best MXPX yet!,"Of All the MXPX cd's i have heard, I must say this is the best. Every song is well done, like all their other songs, but what sets this one is apart is that all the songs are just better. Well Adjusted is probably the best song ever to be featured in a commercial. Everything Sucks is an excellent song, and this CD (I hope) will have more than just two singles."
1,this album blows hard!,"i got my first mxpx album when i was in sixth grade. pokinatcha made me fall in love with punk... it was frenetic, loud, and pushed a good message as well. those kids were only 16 when they made that album and man, did it rock. now, eight years later, mxpx has become a parody of themselves... most bands wait until well into their careers to get on their knees to make people like them, but the fellas from mxpx seem to have no problem sacrificing every shred of integrity they ever had with this album. i thought they were getting back on track with an ep released on fat, but i was sorely mistaken. they're still a killer live band and slowly going the way of the buffalo is among the best and most flawless pop-punk albums of all time in my book, but unless you want another pussy simple plan knock-off album with trite lyrics, save yourself fifteen bucks and alotta mental anguish. r.i.p. mxpx"
2,I don't know what to think,"I've listened to mxpx since i was in 5th grade, I bought this album thinking, ""Hey it's probably good"" And when i first listened to it, it was catchy and poppy i didn't think it was all that bad, I put it in my player with my other mxpx cds and the new one lacks everything the old ones have, The old cds aren't really ""PUNK"" But they are much much more so then this cd, It seems they are just starting to blend in with many other bands that are out there, Before they were different and now they sound like everyone eles, They lost their touch and i'm hoping they see that and come back to what made me love them so long ago. They are very very polished sounding.Overall I would say don't buy this cd if you are a new fan to them, Get slowly going the way of the buffalo or life in general, If you are an mxpx fan.. Atleast you have some respect for them already.. so if you want it buy it, i don't recommend it."
2,What Happened?,"BEFORE EVERYTHING else these guys rocked, now AFTER all these years they've gone soft. Don't get me wrong, MXPX is an awesome band, one of my favorites...but unfortunately the songs they created for this CD is NOT punk or should I say not them. YES, change is good, but not this kind of change. I got into MXPX because of the energy they use to put out into every song. Now I'll be hearing elevator versions of the songs in this CD everywhere."
5,Absolutely great,"It's amazing how different they make all of their cds sound. This cd is indeed unique, but is great in an MXPX way. The song ""Well Adjusted"" is the song from the Diet Pepsi commercial, and that's what first made me want to buy the cd. If you love MXPX, you wont be dissapointed."
4,KILLER CD!,"I have to admit that it's not my favorite MxPx album, but I still loved it. There are a few songs on there that have become so of my favorite songs, but one or two songs that I didn't really like. I'm still an MxPx fan always and forever. Overall I still thought it was a good CD, much better than other ""music"" out there."
5,Sweetest MxPx cd yet,Ok this cd rocks. There are so many good songs on it. I am hooke on BEA and i know you will be too. Go pick it up TODAY
4,New MXPX cd,"I am a huge fan of mxpx and I just got this new cd and I like it a lot. It has great, catchy songs and the music overall rules. The only bad thing about it was it isn't as punkish as their other cd's. It is more of a pop-rock type of music. Other than that i definitely give it a great rating"
2,very different direction!,"mxpx is a very upbeat punk band and has always released exelent records for fans of this type of music....BUT if u listen to all their records in order dont u see a pattern forming??each record gets a littlre slower and a little softer and a little less punk rock. well this ""before everything and after"" hammered the final nail in mxpx's punk rock coffin. this is not a punk rock record by far so do not expect it!over all this is a very mature record and shows alot of growing pains and relationship advice as usual. mxpx has always strived too be an mtv band and now they have finally achieved this goal.smell ya later ""magnefied plaid"" it was nice knowing you when u were a punk band good luck with your new fan base!Memo to mike Herrera: dude... ive always been a loyal fan too you why do u insist on dissapointing me?!stop simplifying everything and write deeper music like you used too get rid of the POP element and come back too punk, the waters warm man...best wishes ...chris"
1,WHAT?!!!!,"i have all 10 of the mxpx full legnth cds. my favorite is teenage politics.if you like loud, fast, ska punk rock then check into mxpx's older cds. but this? I don't know what to say. I didn't really like the ever passing moment but it still had a couple of catchy songs on it. the only good one is the capitol, track 11. don't get this cd! get one of their older ones. BELIEVE ME!"
1,nothing like before......,If you like Good Charlotte you will love this cd... BUT THIS IS NOT GC ITS MXPX... True mxpx fans-stick with the old stuff! This is not the MXPX that i know. Sorry to disapoint... track 14 is the only MXPX sounding song on the disc (if you count the ever passing moment as MXPX sounding.) This cd is like metalicas St. Anger ... NOT GOOD-OR TRUE TO THE OLD FANS ...
1,i cant believe this!,mxpx used to be my all time favorite band with fast PUNK songs for God. now on this new album it is so slow and does not even talk about God. im really dissapointed. if you are going to buy an album by them i suggest anyone besides this one
1,Don't Do It!,"Do not buy this horrible CD! It has such poppy vocals and to make up for it they play boring, repetitive riffs. On the inside there is a picture of the band and they all look the same and their lip is pierced in the same place. When was conforming considered punk rock? They sound like every other band who claims to be punk now adays like Good Charlotte, Simple Plan ect, and their lyrics are sappy and predictable. If you want punk rock go buy some: Operation Ivy, Minor Threat, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Ramones, The Misfits and/or The Buzzcocks. DON'T FALL IN TO THE MARKETING TRAP! Thank You!"
3,"I'm ok your ok, this cd is ok",I have been a huge Mxpx Fan for at least 8 years and this cd has changed their whole style. They turned their sound into more of a pop punk sound! The only thing that hasn't changed is Mike Herrera voice. If you want good Mxpx I recommend LIFE IN GENERAL album. Rawk on!
3,Not that great,"Okay, I love MxPx, but this album dissapointed me. The only good songs are Play It Loud, Well Adjusted, and a few others which get old really quick. I also don't see any of their amazing lyric writing on this album, and the music just sounds like Relient K. Luckily, the new MxPx album Panic has returned to the good stuff. Unless you are a die hard fan who just must own every MxPx album, go ahead and skip this. Instead buy Panic or one of the older albums."
2,Too poppy.,"This is, by far, the worst of all the MxPx albums. Get this if you like Good Charlotte. If you like good pop punk you'll like ANY of their other releases."
5,"Don't know about earlier MXPX, but this rocks!","I don't know how this compares to earlier MXPX stuff, but I love this album. A mature punk sound that rocks. Lots of songs about the ups and downs in a relationship. One of my favorite CDs."
2,mxpx and myself,"well, i'm about 19 years old, i've been listening to mxpx since i was 12, they were my first favorite band and they still are. i always admired mike for his lyrics and catchy tunes, he was my hero. whenever i had a problem, they were who i turned to. they also got me into playing guitar and i started listening to more punk. later as i got older i saw how they started to change. there is a big difference between ""slowly going the way of the buffalo"" and ""ever-passing moment"". now they don't even sound like the same band. i kinda feel bad about laying this new cd along with others. i try to get into it. i can't seem to find God in they're lyrics anymore. now they're songs are about the same as anything you'd find at a music store. i guess i just grew up. but i still listen to they're older cds and when i do, it's like listening to a story about my life. well, i don't really have much to say for this record. thanks for reading this review. i hope it helps."
4,"mxpx new cd, some what different from the LCP","the new mxpx cd ""before everything and after"" is a little bit of a difference from the bands previous work. the songs are without any question good and very catchy. but different, they would be more about happiness and wanting to be with someone and that you are in love. mxpx sound is a little different, id say a little acoustic. but none the else good and a great cd to listen to with friends,girlfriends/boyfriends, or even getting over an Ex. also mxpx has still kept to the style of the left coast punk sound as always. so go pick up the new cd today. mxpx has t"
5,WHAT AN ALBUM,"THIS HAS TO BE THIER BEST ALBUM YET. THEY REALLY OUT DID THEMSELVES WITH THIS ONE. THE MUSIC IS UPBEAT & WILL KEEP YOU MOVING & THE LYRICS ARE SOMETHING YOU CAN RELATE TO. I HELP DO SOUND IN THE AREA I LIVE IN & THE WAY THEY PUT THE MUSIC TOGETHER & MIXED IT WAS GREAT. I CAN LISTEN TO A GOOD SONG OR ALBUM FOR A LITTLE WHILE, BUT THIS ONE I CAN PICK-UP & LISTEN TO ANYTIME & IT NEVER GETS OLD. IF YOU LIKE BANDS LIKE THE ATARIS, YELLOWCARD, GOOD CHARLOTTE, OR ANY PUNK ROCK/GLAM ROCK BAND YOU SHOULD PICK THIS ALBUM UP."
2,"Ummm, Everything Sux When I Listen To This CD","Where do I start? I have been a fan since the 1st MXPX album. I have every CD the band has ever released. Most of the songs on this CD remind me of Good Charlotte (that is bad). The lyrics and music are very repetitive and not nearly as creative as the older CD's. Who knows, maybe this new poppy repetitive stuff will put them on MTV with all the other lame pop punk bands. Makes me sad to see such a cool band put out such a bad CD."
3,They can do better than this.,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good cd and probably worth a listen, but it and The Ever Passing Moment are just so disappointing after being hooked on their older albums and the awesome stuff they use to put out. They are joining the hundreds of other poppy soft punk bands and losing sound and lyrical quality that made them different. If you are into catchy shallow punk, if you can still call it punk, this would be a good cd for you. If not I'd recommend Life in General or Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo or even Pokinatcha."
3,it's not bad...just not mxpx,This cd was decent i had not to many problems with it....it just doesnt sound like mxpx its sounds more like there side band arthur which ive seen many times...if u like a more slower paced mxpx album then u will like this
1,"Should be titled ""From the Punk to the Junk""","This band used to write really solid punk tunes with a lot of original style, but this album goes far beyond generic. It sounds like they hired writers to come in and write ""radio friendly"" hits for them. Every song sounds like it was edited to perfection in Protools which just doesn't work for this band. I wasn't really happy with The Everpassing Moment, but it still has songs that I like. This album on the other hand is some of the worst music I've ever heard. My advice to MxPx is to stop trying so hard to be a huge arena rock band, get rid of there stacks of effects processors, get rid of their rows and rows of guitars and play some freaking punk music. Get a guitar and a half stack and play music. This album is perfect example of a band that is trying so hard to write music that will be popular they have gone full circle and not realized that they just finished a session of horribly stale music. Save your money and buy the next Arthur album."
