4,Lodge Logic grill,We were very happy with the grill except for the fact that they didn't sent the screws to put it together. we had to go purchase the screws on our own.
4,great little grill,"Great grill that performs very well. Especially good for steaks, chops,shrimp and grilled vegtables. Gets very hot and sears food very nice"
5,Fantastic Grill,The wife and I ordered the Lodge grill Sunday. Got it today on Thursday and grilled some dogs and kabobs.Couldnt be happier with the grill or the price.I love cast iron so the grill is a nice addition to the family
5,love cast iron,"I have not used it as of yet, but that's ok, I love the way it is built, the size is perfect for a single person or a couple."
4,Great Little Grill,"I love using the Sportman's Grill. It gets hot fast and temperature control is easy with the damper and two-position grate. I keep mine seasoned with pam and keep the water out by covering it with an old cookie sheet while it cools down.This grill is definitely for hardcore charcoal users. I can see where less experienced grillers might not be able to get good results. If you need a thermometer to cook a steak, this is not your grill. If you cam measure temperature by how long you can hold your bare hand over the coals, this grill is for you.I only gave it four stars because I don't find it very easy to clean out. All of the loose parts have to be removed (grill, charcoal grate, damper door, and the front door) to get all the ash out. Also, I find the carrying handle is nearly useless. The grill is unbalanced so that if you try to pick it up with all of the aformentioned parts attached, it tips over and all the parts end up on the ground. Be careful."
5,Best Hibachi on the market right now.,"This is a well made Hibachi type grill. It is excellent, right out of the box. Pre-seasoned, easy to put together, durable and it cooks terrific. Even heat, fair amount of grill space, and food tastes best over wood/charcoal fire. I've had a few other grills, from Weber Smokie Joe's on up. This one is my favorite. I use it more than my $900 stainless propane grill because the food tastes better. That's what it's all about, right?My only 2 wishes would be more than 2 grill heights and a cast iron cover for smoking/ heat retention on certain foods. I bought a Hibachi, so I knew going in, but these two items would be killer if Lodge is listening......."
5,Nicely Crafted - Works Great!!,"My wife bought me one of these as a Christmas gift. She knows I like to cook on all things outside and this is a real treat. I already have a Weber smoker and Weber Genesis grill, but this is something Ii can keep right outside the back door. It heats up fast and evenly and I have been using lump charcoal which is a fast and high temp fuel for it and have dome filet mignon and chicken wings so far. I am looking forward to using it often to get that charcoal flavor that gas grills just can't reproduce. Do yourself a favor and get a chimney starter for best results."
3,Sturdy grill,"I use this for Civil War reenacting, so it's useful for me so I don't have to have a campfire for small fires. On the downside, it's heavy, sooty and rusts like crazy."
1,poor radio,I currently have an old Emerson Research that does not adjust to daylight saving time since Congress changed the dates and I was looking to upgrade. I returned this item because I could not tune the radio station that I have listened to for over 25 years. I will stick with the older model that allows me to hear the radio station that I like.I would have rated the item zero stars but the web site would not allow me to do that.
3,Slow,This seems to be a good product with one exception. Its sets the time four minutes slow. You can adjust the time to the correct time so what good is the built in timer?
1,Wake up to static,"I was originally very happy with the product but after about 9 months I found myself waking up to unpleasant static in either the radio or alarm mode. I went to the manufacturer's web site for warranty information and found that they required it to be shipped in the original box, have the original copy of the warranty and a receipt. I only had the receipt, courtesy of Amazon. The web site also did not provide the address to return the product to."
4,Carlotta looks for missing women,"Carlotta Carlyle can barely makes ends meet with her two jobs as a cab driver and a private investigator in Boston. She counts herself fortunate when she gets two cases at once, but she soon regrets her decision to take them both. Her first client is a young teenage boy who hires Carlotta to track down a 14-year-old girl who is missing. The second case involves Carlotta's longtime friend and ex-boss, Lieutenant Mooney, who asks her to track down a missing witness who can testify for him in a case against a man who accuses him of assault. As these two cases unfold, Carlotta has to deal with two irresponsible plumbers who threaten to turn her bathroom into a garish horror. Author Barnes artlessly weaves the criminal cases in with Carlotta's personal life which is often hilarious and never dull. This is a worthy follow-up to Trouble of Fools, the first book of this enjoyable series."
3,The Ex,"This thriller is indeed extremely thrilling and very suspenseful. To say the least, it is very clichéd, but it does not take away from the extreme chills I got when watching this. Yancy Butler does an amazing job as the psycho Diedre, and I liked Suzy Amis in her sweet and innocent role. The scene where Diedre is lifting weights and Molly and David see her is very scary and got me very excited. The only thing I have to complain about is the fact that this film has too much sexual topic, and the lesbian doctor thing is quite annoying. Diedre seems obsessed with the idea! Overall, I'd say its worth three, maybe three and , but I wouldn't give it five. Suspense is good, Butler's performance is over-the-top and viciously excellent, but the sexual content for some reason bugs me in this movie."
3,Be careful whom you married...and divorce,"THe EX, based on a novel by John Lutz, revolves around a man played by Nick Mancuso, who is being stalked by his ex-wife, Deirdre, played by Yancy Butler. Of course, Mancuso cannot tell his current wife about his torrid past with Deirdre, but as Deirdre ingratiate herself to his wife and son, he finally put his foot down and told her to get out of his life. This made Dierdre ever the more determine to ruin him. And murder is just a mere inconvenience to her. Drowning men in bath tubs seems to be a routine activity for her.""The Ex"" is not exactly a huge budget suspense movie, but Yancy Butler is riveting in her gleefully wicked performance as Diedre. The rest of the cast is adequate, especially Nick Mancuso. Overall, this a movie you rent, not buy."
4,"Better, but still Not the Best","Like one of the reviewers who preceded me here, I think this disc is more successful than its companion that features the Concertos Nos. 1 and 2. For one, there's more enthusiasm in the No. 3 than was in evidence in the No. 2 and certainly the No. 1. For another, the cadenzas work this time around. My only quibble is that the delicate parts of the Concerto No. 4 seem not that delicate. For an original instrument integral cycle of these concertos, I still prefer Steven Lubin's team-up withe Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music. Not that these performances are bad -- I like them, truth to tell, just not as much as the Lubin/Hogwood ones."
3,Defective,"While this violin has a nice sound and the case is super nice, my violin arrived with a defect. I was told to send it back so they could replace it with a new one, but then they told me they can't do that. So I had to play with missing fine tuners until I found a store that could help me (we're U.S. military living in Japan - the language barrier made it difficult to explain my problem and how I wanted them to help). When you purchase a violin, you just expect the violin to come with all its parts. I would have had a much more positive opinion if it were the case or something else other than the actual violin that had the problem."
3,Native American Species of Prunus,"This is a reprint of an original publication from 1915. The problems I have with it are as follows: 1) the text was scanned using an editable format and has numerous misspellings that was never corrected so it is a real raw scan with horrible formatting. 2) all of the figures or photos etc. are missing. Otherwise, the text is somewhat readable and has some great information. There are 2 sections. The first section gives an Introduction, Distribution, Variation and Adaptability, Early History of American Plums, Early Botanical Descriptions, Horticultural History and Development, Systematic Botany, Key to Species, Descriptions of the Species and their Hybrids. Section 2 has figure listings for Native American Species of Prunus and then a separate listing of Hybrid Varieties. There are also some further descriptions in this section as well as the literature cited. If you're looking for drawings or photos you won't find any in this reprint!"
3,"Works, while it lasts","These bulbs do what they are supposed to. When they are on and there is adequate water flow through your UV sterilizer, you should be free from algae and bacteria which discolor your water. I use it on a 55 gallon FOWLR tank and it always does its job. The only problem is the short life span. It doesn't get nearly the 10,000 hours which it claims to. I would say I have averaged about 4-5 months per bulb over the past 4 years of using this UV sterilizer. This can start to get somewhat expensive and time consuming to always replace the bulb. Also, unless you check the bulb regularly, it may burn out and you and you won't realize it until there is a problem.Overall: works well but doesn't last long enough"
2,"Quick, but stupid shipping","When I picked my package up from the post office, I had to pay shipping, AGAIN. I had already paid shipping when I purchased the book from amazon. However, I super appreciate the cost of the book and shouldn't be complaining because I could have spent nearly one hundred dollars in the school store."
5,Great book,"I enjoyed this book. I do think this is a book for all children , it has great stiries for the whole family. I love to read this book to my daughter."
5,Just great!,Very well written and inspiring self-help book. The best in the market. I would recommend it to everyone. Shipment perfectly on time.
2,Too cerebral and passionless...,"Gollaher paints a very dull picture of Dorothea Dix. There is not one colorful insight into this fascinating, world-changing woman. If there was even a hint of love or respect, or even curiosity about his subject, the author never reaveals it. There is an inexcusable failure on the author's part to make this famous lady 'touchable'. He discredits her faith with one stroke of his pen and rambles about the more cerebral parts of her life and work. Yes, she was interested in other things besides helping people but I don't care to know about how many bugs she collected and how many famous persons she socialized with. I want to know about Dorothea Dix! This was one of the most discursive, spiritless biographies I have read in many years. Read another biographer's account of this amazing woman, perhaps one that is written by a woman."
4,Sensuously spiritual,"This follow-up to ""Vision"" (which features the same composer lineup of von Bingen and Souther) is a definite step up. The lush arrangements of Souther's synths mixed with the ethereal sequences of von Bingen combine to form a tapestry that is not only sensual but downright erotic at times. Track 2 - O ignis Spiritus Paracliti - is a prime example. Cello's dark harmonies with the slow, driving beat lay a rich throb to accompany Sister Germaine and Ms. Riain's angelic melodies. Interspersed between the lyricism is Souther's own complex, yet appealing, contrapuntal accompaniments.Fans of Deleirium's ""Karma,"" Dead Can Dance, and other beat-driven ambient works may profit greatly from listening to this recording and its prequel."
3,"stick with ""Vision""","I thought Souther's Vision was brilliant. Everybody will find the blend there of old and new very gratifying. The instrumentals here tend to be monotonous, but even the vocals lack the drama of Vision."
4,Excellent color guide of Hematology for quick review,"This is a good pocket book for quick review on many Hematological subjects. Instead of reading 'pure' text about Hematology, this pocket book presents to you many high-quality color photographs on the right of every page, while sparing the left page for a concise text. The photographs consist largely of morphological examination of blood and marrow."
1,Severe disappointment,"I had high hopes for this trimmer, especially since it claims to be manufactured by the inventor of this style. While the design works great and is very comfortable to use, the blade splinters my cat's claws, even when cutting vertically across the claw as directed. This happened starting with the first use, so the blade should have been more than sharp at that point. Now, I stick to using human nail clippers on her claws and achieve much superior results."
5,Would you get me my blue soapbox please? I would like to make a speech,"I love this recording! All of the musical numbers take place during three separate dream sequences. Parts of it are over-the-top, but it's meant to be that way. It's not meant to be naturalistic.Ris Stevens plays Liza Elliot, a fashion magazine editor, who is undergoing psychoanalysis because she has been suffering from depression. Liza presents her dreams to her analyst, and the musical numbers spring forth from these dreams.I prefer this recording to the more complete recording with Maria FriedmanLady In The Dark (1997 Original London Cast)."
2,"Small, Burnt looking Parrot","Looks more like a small burnt, motley parrot than a Phoenix. Definitely Not worth the price I paid for it. I told my 10 year old niece it was in the molting phase and needed extra care. Thank goodness I had other presents for her B-day."
4,Nicely done. This was decent quality and arrived in good time as a gift. I'd use this co. again w/out hesitation.,This was decent quality and arrived in good time as a gift. I'd use this co. again w/out hesitation and recommend them for such items.
3,Stuffed Harry Potter Fawkes,"The toys was smaller than I thought it would be for the price. It also came with a small tear in the back stitching which I fixed myself since it was a Christmas gift and there was no time to return it. She likes having it with her other Harry Potter items. But unfortunately, stuffed toys spend more time on the bed, than in play."
1,Terrible!!!,This was such a waste of money - I am so happy I only got it used! If you are looking for AUTHENTIC New Mexico foods this is NOT it!! I have lived in New Mexico all my life and this is just BS! Sorry New Mexico we are better than this!!! :(
3,So far have not found a real good recipe,"I had high hopes for this Southwestern/Meican recipe book when I bought it. What could go wrong when you get recipes of the best supposedly from all over in this case New Mexico? Lots. The book looks nice but its what's inside that counts. I have not found one that has ""wowwed"" me yet. I just made a cheese tuna mexican casserole recipe (where I added black beans). It came out hot, bubbly and bland. The recipe did not specify the type of green chiles and while I tried some Smoked Jalapeno sauce on it to make it better and it was , I was still disappointed. My wife, whom I did not think would like it all, liked it though. However a recipe that I never would make again never rates a 9/10 or higher and in this case it was 8.5/10.I might try more. Wish the authors could have broken these recipes to hot, spicy, texmex, etc."
4,"Has it all (well, most) and then some","As far as multi-layered, multi-talented Christmas collections are concerned, this is one of the best you'll ever find. I was disappointed that my favorite Christmas song ""O Holy Night"" was not included on this rather large collection. ""O Holy Night"" is one of the most perfect songs for wide-ranging voice talent such as is represented here.Perhaps it is just me, but it looks rather odd to see Michael Bolton in this picture. No doubt, his voice is much better than many of his contemporaries; but I think other talent should have been in his place instead. Still his presence here does not take away from the quality of the music. But I think more appropriate voice talent could have added a lot more.Besides the pop standards of Michael Bolton, the powerhouse of Placido Domingo, and the sweet eloquence of Ying Huang (whom I had never heard of before purchasing this), the listener is also treated to some amazing children's choir pieces and beautiful instrumentals."
4,Not Too Shabby,"The taste is pretty good but the skins are too thin and hard to work with. Still, if you haven't had this in a long time, it is a treat!"
2,Last 4 editions are identical,My only concern is that the 2004 edition is identical to the editions of the past 5 years. Nothing new except for a few more pics.
3,"Necessary, but by itself not sufficient","A must-have guide for Step 1 prep. But by itself, not sufficient to cover the nitty-gritty details found on The Test. Best used as starting point in January or February, then add BRS review series. Mix in Kaplan QBank along the way. Alternatively, instead of BRS, you may want to review your own class notes on pathophysiology (which I did, and found quite helpful, even though it's more time-consuming). And, be sure to keep up with current health events in the news (they show up on the boards)!"
2,Forget about First Aid.,"First Aid for Step 1 is like Netter's -- not very good and highly overrated. The book is a mess of random information that has no connection and no flow to it, and is therefore difficult, frustrating and low-yield. The only good part of the book are the images but these can be found online (WebPath) for free. I skimmed First Aid once, tossed it aside and spent all of my time with Step-Up which is a MUCH better book."
3,a classic,"Got this for my husband as it is a favorite family line. Product was slightly bent, despite their efforts at careful packing."
2,Grainy picture,"I love the sentiment because I'm a Monty Python fan. Unfortunately, the picture quality on the sign is disappointing."
4,"ok, but this is a personal interest story that is not really about Bombay Beach","This award-winning documentary is based around a few principal characters who live in or near Bombay Beach on the Salton Sea. It's an interesting story about these characters, but doesn't deal with the history of Bombay Beach and the Salton Sea (which is the story that most interests me), so I was disappointed. However, this is an interesting story of a few of life's underprivileged who live in BB.If you're interested in a DVD documentary on the history of BB and SS, Plagues and Pleasures of the Salton Sea by Chris Metzler is strongly recommended."
5,Best documentary of the year.,"""Bombay Beach"" is that rare film that attempts to be something truly new. And it succeeds. The documentary genre is an important one, but it tends to take itself too seriously these days. Whether it's the muckraking of Michael Moore or the We-Know-What's-Good-For-Your patronizing of Frontline, documentary films have become cliches that too often play it safe with conventional shooting, editing, and storytelling. ""Bombay Beach"" is poetic and lyrical and all the things that naysayers will condemn it for being. But, in my opinion, that's a good thing. Some of the most meaningful non-fiction stories come in the form of poems and songs and dances. This film deftly combines the best of many artistic genres into a compelling, stunning story of real people in a real town dealing with real problems."
2,Didn't hold my attention...,"There are very few dvd's I've watched that I could not finish and this was one of them. I give the film high marks for visuals and technique but I found the film surreal and contrived. I was particularly disappointed that the residents of the Salton Sea community were asked to ""perform"". It's as if they are just following a script and the result is somewhat wooden and contrived. The waltz scene made me uncomfortable. I did appreciate, however, the director's intent to make the Salton Sea community a poetic commentary but I don't think the objective was obtained."
4,Interesting,An interesting and brief history of this most violent and rapid-changing period in English history.
4,If your looking for a high end subwoofer!,"We have looked at and listened to all the high end subs. We bought this subwoofer because a 1000 watt subwoofer was way out of our price range. At first I was disappointed because I thought the sound was not crisp or clean. But we replaced some 15 year old bose speakers with some brand new klipsch and that made all the difference in the world!!!! We mostly use it for movies and it really helps give the movie theater effect we were looking for!It is a pretty big box, so you need to have a place for it in your room. It was easy to assemble and compared to the $1000 and up subwoofers with the same wattage, I think this one does quite nicely."
4,An excellent and realistic account of a Christian life.,"This autobiography of the author of such classics as ""Treasure in the Snow"" and ""Star of Light"" is itself a real treasure. Patricia St. John doesn't engage in any ""everything is happy happy happy"" account of her life. There is a realism and depth that those who take their Christian life seriously can connect and relate to. In my own opinion, the poem near the end ""The Alchemist"" is in itself worth the price of the book. If you are skeptical of the popular evangelical cliches that trivialize Christian experiance and Biblical truths about the Christian life, this book will be breath of fresh air."
4,Pretty good introduction to concepts,"This video moves though some complex concepts very quickly. While it covers most of the points well it could be confusing for someone trying to learn the information for the fist time.The video is helpful for teaching new concepts to first timers but it still needs to be paired with hands on experience and a knowledgeable teacher to have any benefits.I think it is a useful tool for houses of worship, education, and other facilities that regularly need to train new people how to operate their sound systems."
3,An interesting and funny opera,"The opera Teseo (1713) by Georg Friedrich Händel has beatiful arias, but it isn`t a proof of greatness that you would like to find in a haendelian opera. However this performance is sensual and the role of Mr. Laszczkowsky as Teseo is excellent. The overture is one of the best that I have heard. The ambiance is creative and funny sometimes. It`s an opera to relax a little, but with very good arias. I recommend it."
2,You Don't Always Get What You See,"This product was advertised as USDA Organic. The product I received wasn't organic, but ""wildcrafted."" In addition, the product was three days late."
5,"The help I needed, the book I was looking for!","This book is not just for very young children. My 11 yo daughter had so much anger wrapped around our divorce that we just couldn't even talk. This book was the break-through we needed to begin talking, crying, understanding, and moving on. She made this book her own, colored the pictures, and had us read it together multiple times, using it to begin discussions about the issues that troubled her."
5,Very Complete,"I was surprised at the depth of and introduction to some critical exercises that even the best strength training books do not even attempt to address: things like wrist strength, pronation movements, and so forth. I felt this book really rounded out my exercises and it pictured the muscles I use so that I could build a more complete routine around all of the muscle groups I wanted to target or had been neglecting. Great book, spiral with pix, easy to take to gym."
5,Total Strength Training for Women,This is first rate fitness book for women getting in shape. I have used this book daily for my work out. I was amazed on how quickly and effortlessly I could improve my own body strength with these techiques. I highly give two thumbs up!
4,Syringe holder,IT is a lot better than carrying a filled syringe in one's pocket but I use the 1/3 ML syringes and it will only use the small BD type not the larger generic syringes
3,Useful tool,"These cases are wothwhile for the diabetic who doesn't want to pack up a whole ""kit"" when going out for dinner or needs to take a couple of injections on an airplane trip. Good gadget. Have used personally and given as gift."
2,Little Disappointed,I was so excited to finally replace my cases after years and years of using my original ones which I purchased for the same price. So I was expecting the same quality product. But I was mistaken. The black one doesn't click closed. The white one is fine though. Seems they decided to skimp on the production a little bit.
5,GREAT,This is an excellent piece of equipment for those of us who need to carry loaded syringes when we are traveling or simply going out for dinner. It is a simple plastic case that can be carried unobtrusively and easily. It was delivered on time and I was entirely pleased with the process.
3,wright prefilled syringe case,Handy...shipped quickly...quite expensive...Would be nice if there was a place to put an alcohol wipe.
3,Works well but overpriced,"This product works well for its intended use, but I feel it is overpriced. The other products available that I saw were not as useful. I will continue to use this and hope it will last a long time."
4,good but needed work,"These subs looked great when they came in. But when I hooked them up there was air muffling on the edge of each sub. They sounded bad. So when I unscewed the subs I was dissipointed at what I saw. On the edges of where they cut the sub hole, it was all broken and looked like they beat it with a hammer. So I first used wood glue to gule all along the edge and clamp it and let it dry over night. Then I did the same thing with epoxy glue to both sub holes. Last I had to put some door sealant on each subs edge where it scews to the sub box so no air would come out. Finally after a week I scewed them back together and hooked them back up. They were 10 times better and vibrated my whole car. Everything else was real great! The subs sounded great and the rest of the sub box was real nice. Carpet was real flat and smooth.Also the blue LEDs make the subs glow. These subs were cheap and great but needed work."
4,"If you like Paul Sauvanet, you'll love this CD","TRACK LISTING:1. Omen (8:42)2. Initiation (9:59)3. Dunes (6:35)4. Eleusis (12:42)5. Tropic (4:09)6. Berceau De Soie (12:06)This CD from 1992/1994 is virtually impossible to find, so if you like Sauvanet's Hearts Of Space albums and you see this for sale used at a reasonable price, you should consider picking it up.This very intriquing work as Eleusis is a little more electronic/ambient/drifting in nature than his later, more consistently symphonic sounding Hearts Of Space works. But ""Initiation"" alone is worth the price as it sets the tone for the symphonic type works to come from him. The title track ""Eleusis"" is a strong, mid-tempo electronic work unlike anything I've heard on a Sauvanet CD previously. ""Tropic"" is tropically atmospheric. ""Omen,"" ""Dunes"" and ""Bercaua de Soie"" are thematic drifters in the vein of Mark Isham's VAPOR DRAWINGS or Brian Eno's THURSDAY AFTERNOON, but with Sauvanet's signature sound."
5,Para expertos y curiosos,El manual ofrece un amplio análisis de la ortografía española y su más reciente revisión (2010) por parte de la Real Academia Española tratando de normalizar el uso por todos los usuarios. Puede ser usado tanto por expertos académicos como también por estudiantes de nivel medio o manual de oficina o cabecera. No se limita a enumerar las reglas de la escritura sino que ofrece un razonamiento que explica el porqué se llega a ellas.
1,Yep - ZERO stars - expensive dowsing rod.,"If you were to make a dowsing rod by assembling a radio antenna and a bicycle grip you'd have this product. Beware the ""no batteries required"" - that's because this does not do ANYTHING. If you tie a flag on it you might be able to tell what direction the wind is blowing with it. Why does amazon stock obvious junk when quality pipe detectors with transmitters and receivers can be purchased for under $200 - run on 2 9V batteries - and actually find your pipes, cables, and other burried stuff?Perhaps this silly toy can also be used to tell you where to drill for water - by alligning itself with the ""magnetic polarization"" of the water molecule underground. For now - keep your $20 in your wallet or google pipe detector transmitter receiver and you'll have a wide choice of units that work based on sound principles hooking a low frequency transmitter to the pipe and using a real receiver that gives you direction with some models giving depth as well."
4,A great selection of Glass' Music,"As anyone who has listened to Glass before knows, his music is not the easiest to listen to, but it is also wonderful once you get used to it. This is probably the best selection that you will get from his compositions without having to buy each of the operas separately. If you enjoy Philip Glass (but don't want to spend hundreds on the full operas) or are just interested in hearing his music, this is definitely the place to start. An incredible compilation!"
4,Better than you'd expect -,"It's not as hip as Bebop, as topical as EVA, or as cool as Big O - but this in-your-face, hyperactive Sakura in her teens is refreshing, well done and different from other anime in its category.Soundtrack is light and pleasant to listen to while retaining enough substance to remain interesting. Motion studies to make a circus theme work, do; color palette varied and beautiful without being overdone.It's an odd one to recommend, but I do - and as an added bonus, it's acceptable for all ages - no worries!"
3,Parents beware! Santa Claus is discussed in Chapter 10!,"Yes, the chapter titles are listed in the Table of Contents. However, I believe there should be some reference to this chapter on the back cover to give parents a heads up!This book was one of several on my daughter's required summer reading list from her school. I read the back cover and even listened to her read the first couple chapters out loud.Maybe it's old fashioned but I looked forward to having this discussion with my daughter....never thought it would be Judy Blume...."
3,Super Fudge,"I wish I had read the alert before we checked out this book!!!When my daughter (8 yrs. old) and I came to the popular Christmas myth issue, I pretended that I was too tired to continue reading. (I hid the book the next morning and then took it back to the library without finishing it. She searched for it for a few days and then forgot.) I was also a little uncomfortable with the whole ""where babies come from"" discussion at the beginning of the book. We had read ""Tales of a Fourth-Grade Nothing,"" and thought this would be a good follow up. I think we'll keep the Judy Blume books on the shelf for a few more years."
4,"Good, could of been better.","This novelization of RE0 is, like its predecessors good at covering the story and doing what the Video game did, although this book had a few events way out of order. While it was only natural that we get a novelization of RE0, I (like others) wished the time spent writing it was used for original RE fiction. It seems only natural that we get a few originals in the future since RE4 is coming out and is set 6 years into Code Veronica's future and Umbrella doesent exist. We need some books on what happened between there and how Umbrella was taken down.At any rate.... this book is well worth the read, it's quick (took me only a few hours over a couple of days), and in my opinion it's better than the Code Veronica novelization."
1,"Bad, bad and very bad","I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil books and a SD Perry fan, however this is one of the worst books I've ever read. Really terrible and the story makes no sense. If anyone reading this hasn't read it yet - skip it!"
2,Rushed throughout the book,"I love the Resident Evil series, but the only problem I had with this book was that I felt very rushed into things. It seemed that every time a character took over the segments there was always suspense: The bat attacks. The centipede attacks. There seemed to be too much action in this book when compared to the others. The characters were always on the move and that made it boring. Sadly, I felt almost the same thing when it came to the game version (Resident Evil 0)."
5,A great read,"I've been a fan of the Resident Evil video game series since I was a preteen and I was excited to learn there was a novel series. After borrowing most of the rest from my library, I knew I needed to own them all myself, despite not reading Zero Hour before purchase.I wasn't disappointed. It was written just as well as the others and just as engaging. It made me think back to the game (0) frequently. It's not 100% canon as none of the others are, but I enjoyed the artistic liberties taken with the story to add in details or tweak some to fit a novelization more adequately. I love it."
3,Not bad,"Probably more suitable for the fans of the video game and readers of the first 3 books in this series. And I think that it could be a little bit longer. Yet, it is not bad, not bad at all."
4,Great Book!,Resident Evil: Zero Hour is a definite read for Resident Evil fans! Especially those who are wanting more of a story out of the game!
3,Don't read first!!,"And hopefully by the time you have read it, you have given enough time between reading this book and the first book in the series, that you've forgotten where the characters are.I understand this is based on the video games, and while I have not played the games (I'm a wuss when it comes to these type of games), it just seems like there is some continuity issues. Book one has Wesker running around with Alpha team. This book has him in a little room watching video monitors while Rebecca and William Coen run around a train, a training facility, and then a water reclamation facility.Good book, and I'm sure it's not Perry's fault. Even though this is a prequel book/game, it doesn't seem to mesh well with the series overall."
3,Fans of the game will enjoy it.,"If you've played the game (as I have), you'll realize that the author does a good job of keeping on track with the game; she offers detailed descriptions in some cases (I always look to detail), and while (to me) it's not really scary, it is entertaining and can be a bit disgusting in some parts. Of course, the author does offer revealing insight into Umbrella and some of it's chief characters that the game does not explain. This book is Good. I think if you're a Resident Evil fan of the games (not the movies), you will enjoy this novel."
1,"Maps, maps, and more maps needed",Maps were not included in this book and for such an excellent story to not include even one map is a terrible mistake. To read this book one has to have an Atlas in your lap at all times and even then some of the directions were impossible to follow. I can not understand why maps were not included.
3,Machosism,"I have read Endurance (about Shakelon's trip) and been to Antarctica in the last few years. The temperature, conditions, and struggle of this book didn't match what I have experienced or read by other authors. I was in Antarctica during the winter, and crossed the Antarctic Circle. The weather conditions were not anything like Mawson's description. He endured great hardships, but it was overdone. The precipitation level on Antarctica is some of the driest in the world and very similar to a desert climate with total precipitation at about 1 inch of water per year. He seemed in the story to be in constant blizzard conditions during the entire summer. Maybe it was an unusally wet year, but the others who went with him on other journeys got by much better. Not my favorite."
5,Looking for inspiration?,"Douglas Mawson is one of the great explorers of our millenium and this is probably the best survival adventure story ever told. The harshest conditions imaginable are revealed to Mawson in body, mind and spirit.Leonard Bickel attains exceptional results transcribing Mawsons field notes, creating a readable account of an enormous struggle few have heard of and one not likely to be matched. Not even Shackelton's story measures up to this one.Recommneded for those who must persevere."
4,Survival against all probability,"In a land of dreadful snow and wind conditions, Mawson set out with two companions to explore far from his coastal base. The story of his trek back after the loss of vital supplies ranks alongside Shackleton's 'Endurance' and Nansen's 'Fram' odysseys. His tale was long overshadowed by the concurrent loss of Scott's party, so a renewal in public awareness of Mawson is to be welcomed.Bickel's account is generally of high quality, and concentrates on the sledging journey. For those interested in the scientific aspects of the expedition, Mawson's own 'Home of the Blizzard' is a good read."
4,great book,"another good book on polar exploration. Hard to put down. How these men trudged on day after day, week after week is hard to understand. I guess the will to survive is hard to let go. You won't be disappointed in this book."
3,Quote......Unquote,"I listened to the unabridged Audible Audio version of this book and I honestly cannot recommend it too highly due largely to the narrator's incessant use of quote and unquote throughtout the book. The reading may have been technically correct but the effect, in my opinion, was extremely distracting. Most likely if I had read the printed copy of the book I would have rated it four stars. The tale is worth knowing. Mawson's epic of endurance stands alongside those of the better known Scott and Shackleton."
3,Mawson's Will - a second-hand account.,"The story of Sir Douglas Mawson's 1911-13 expedition to Antarctica is, without question, one of the greatest survival stories ever told, and Bickel rises to the task in Mawson's Will. Despite this, Bickel's book is no match for Sir Douglas Mawson's personal account of his adventure, as related in the landmark work, The Home of the Blizzard. Given the choice, Home of the Blizzard is the preferred account of this adventure."
3,"Good story, horrible proofreading","Perhaps there was an issue with the conversion to Kindle but this book has tons of errors in it. It is almost as if certain words and phrases got jumbled or replaced by mistake. You can always tell what is meant, so you can follow the story, but for $10 I felt ripped off for getting such a poorly edited book. I've never read anything with so many errors.Also, it mentioned photos and/or illustrations but none were in the Kindle version.Good story though if you can make it through the errors."
5,Well written and suspenseful,"Rarely have I read a more courageous account of the unconquerable human will to survive. I believe that 99% of trekkers would have given up and died in the snow. I don't know if the title is completely accurate in claiming to be the greatest polar survival story ever written, but it certainly ranks up there near the top. At no time do I recall the story dragging. In fact, I kept finding excuses to quit what I was doing and go spend another hour with my nose buried in the pages. I liked this account about as much as I liked Into Thin Air by Krakauer. A cracking good tale."
4,Hollywood ending-but real,"This story could translate well into a movie plot with little, if any, changed made. I agree with some of the random conversations between characters with no idea of how the author knows that they occured but it wasn't enough to give it 1 star. I also don't understand the giving of 1 star becase the story is great but it didn't include any maps. That's a bit harsh.I bought this book based on the reviews on here. I am not an antarctic exporation buff-actually I have no previous experience with this sort of genre-but I really enjoyed the story and would certainly do some further studying in the field of polar exploration if another book surfaced as well written as this with as compelling of a story."
5,"GUIDES US 2 THE TRUTH, DESTROYING ALL THE MISSLEADINGS","I KNOW THAT THIS A GENINUINE BOOK ABOUT GOD, THAT WILL HELP US TOUNDERSTAND HIS PURPOUSE BETTER, AND THEREFORE TO UNDERSTAND OUR OWNSELFS MUCH BETTER. CONGRATULATIONS MR WALSH !!! JC SELFS MUCH BETTER."
3,Hamlet sound track - Patrick Doyle,"I spent a lot of time trying to get hold of this CD but I must say I am mildly disappointed. I thought Patrick Doyle's music for Branagh's Henry V was brilliant and that was why I was determined to obtain this sound track as well. Henry V is not Hamlet in terms of theme and plot but I think the music here tends to be too low key and lacking in drive, unlike Henry V. It is still very good in places and clearly the work of an excellent composer, but not quite up to Doyle's previous standard."
4,An intelligent classical piece,"I have not seen the movie, but the score for this epic film is top notch composition. The two main themes are so simple there brilliant. Doyle proves, like the latest scores from John Williams, that you don't have to have loud orchestral themes to enhance a movie. Less is sometimes more."
4,WISH I WERE GOING TO PAREE ALSO,"The appeal to me was simple. The group (farmer and his animals)were in the countryside of France and they were going to Paris.Ms. Stock, as illustrator, does a fine job of giving a sense ofplace in her illustrations. I have been to Paris and I think shecaptures its essence. And like me, the animals are ""already planning their next trip.""A child of picture-book age, would have to have some pretty serious wanderlust to love this book for the same reasons that I do. But my 3 year old granddaughter loves the illustrations of the animals, particularly when they are doing very human-like things, such as visiting a museum and eating in a restaurant. ""They are so silly"" she exclaims, and then chuckles.That is a four-star recommendation in my book!"
3,Alanna The First Adventure,"This book is one that combines magic with adventure. If you like adventure or magic or both then this is a good read. The book is about Alanna and her twin brother Thom. Alanna doesn't want to learn to be a lady but to be a knight. Her brother Thom on the other hand would rather be a sorcerer then a knight. Alanna cuts her hair short so she looks like a boy and heads for the palace. When she first arrives she is bullied and pushed around by Ralon of Malven. She shows Ralon that no one messes with her. Later, she learns and becomes the best of the other pages in archery, sword fighting, fencing, horseback, and not to mention she is also a good student. She saves her friend Jonathon, whose heir to the throne, from death twice and Jonathon's evil cousin, Duke Roger. This was an action packed book and I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,Pretty Good Story of a Young Girl,"At times this book was juvenile, but when the love scene in bed between Alanna and Jonathan came on it was just too much for the range of age this book aims at.The love scene was just too trashy and dirty for the kids that are to read this book. Some do it well, some don't . In this case, it is vulgar and tiresome. The ""love"" between the two could not be felt anyways, and by the end of this sequel, it's no surprise.If you liked this book, try ""THE IMMORTALS"" or ""THE CROWN & COURT DUET"", both are fabulous reads."
5,Song of the Lioness review,"This is an awesome book that draws the reader into its story until you do not want to put it down! I have read the whole series about a billion times and still find it absolutely thrilling. Tamora Pierce is an awesome author, spinning her tale with such skill that it is a must read. It will satisfy raeders from the age of 5 up. I'm a definite admirer!"
5,THE BEST BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ I WISH THEY MADE A MOVIE OF IT THOUGH THAT WOULD BE AWESOME! I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANY BOY OR GIRL WHO WANTS A GOOD READ!!!!!!!!!!!!IT SHOWS ALANNA'START TO A SEEK OF KNIGHTHOOD
4,"Socecery, Swash-buckling, and Cross-dressing","Alanna switches places with her twin brother, disguising herself as a boy to train as a knight. Can she keep it from the others at the palace, and what happens when she doesn't always want to be a boy? Does she have what it takes to become a knight?This is my favorite of Tamora Pierce's books. As with Mercedes Lackey, her first character seems to be her most genuine, though as with Lackey, you can tell that Pierce learned much about how plot went together throughout this series.This is a great book for middle school and younger high school readers. Girls get into it easier, as the heroine is a girl, but there is enough action that boys tricked into picking it up do manage to stay interested. Warning: there is *gasp* sex in the series.As a side note, anyone having the chance to meet Tamora Pierce should do so. She's a pretty awesome woman."
5,Alanna,"Ijust totaly loved these books! This 1 is one of the best i have ever read! i have read all of tamora's books up to the 2nd protector of the small book! if u have not read this book then you have not read a thing! Tamora is the best writer and i wish i could meet her! LET ME TELL U SOMETHING,i waited so long to get these books that when i got them for cristmass i junped up and down screaming! then not using any of my other preasants i started reading them from the 1st to the last of them.(even though i had read them 5 times already) all my friends have read these books and Hopefully so will youAT LEAST GIVE THEM A TRY!ANOTHER GOOD AUTHER IS PHILIP PULLMAN"
5,Tamora Pierce has mastered the art!,"I'm a huge fan of Tamora Pierce's works. I've read almost everything she's written, and this series is by far the greatest! Alanna is a wonderful heroine and the story has a wonderful plotline. This isn't my favorite book in the series, but it still is a fabulous work. I would reccomend this to people who like adventure, magic, and mystery."
5,LOVE IT!,"A few days ago I picked up the second book first and thought it sounded interesting. Then by accident I found the first book and bought it too! I'm still halfway thru the first, but I love it! I think that if I lived in the times of knights I would be like Alanna, for I couldn't stand to be a ""proper lady"" either. It is a wonderful book and I can't wait to get the 3rd and 4th ones and read them! And I'm an 18 year old college student! :-)"
5,Can't stop reading!,"I can't believe how one person's life has affected my own. Day and night I am reading the Alanna series again and again. From her magical powers to her athletic abilities, Alanna enchants even the weak minded with her courage. One will cry out when she struggles, yet rejoice when she succeeds. All must say ""Great Merciful Mother!"" at this wondorous work of art."
5,Timeless.,"I think this book is awesome!!! I remember just passing through the library and randomly grabbing a book. It happened to be this story.... and before I knew it I was hooked. And just imagine how cool the whole setup would have been to a girl-- I mean, a female knight! The people I have run into that have read this book also have loved it. I think it's a great story to introduce to girls because the heroine's a tough young woman who they can kind of look up to."
3,Be careful o f the age of girls you're giving this book to,"After reading several reviews of this book, I picked and ordered the book for my daughter's 10 year old book club. I thought it would be an exciting change of pace for them. I didn't realize the chapter ""Womanhood"" would be in there - several girls haven't learned everything about ""growing up"" yet and I felt terrible I was starting the discussions. So although several reviews say every 10 year old should read this - I would up the age to 12!"
2,I cant say I loved it,I am sorry but this book did not take me any where. I would have gave it a 1 but it had a good plot. Tamora Pierce's books do not pull me in. They go to fast and don't have enough details. I also wish they told more about her brother. I would NOT recomend this to boys. For reasons if you read this book you will understand. I know many people like it so don't take the book the wrong way. I just didn't like it. The next series that starts with Tricksters Queen looks much better. Even the title is better!
5,One of the best!,"Do you like magic or knights? If you do,this book is for you! Alanna is a girl who wants to become a knight.One small problem. As you can guess,girls can't become knights.But that doesn't stop Alanna!She and her twin brother Thom switch places.Thom goes to the City of the Gods to become a sorceror,while Alanna goes to the capital city of Corus to become a knight.There Alanna meets up with Raoul,Gary,Alex,and Prince Jonathan.They soon become friends.She also meets Duke Roger,whom she has a bad feeling about.She meets other people,too,and gets in her share of trouble. Set in the imaginary realm of Tortall,Alanna's story will interest readers of all ages.I highly reccomend this book."
5,The Beginning...,Alanna is a great person and this series is just great. Any young woman should love her adventures and the reality based story line. Strong character and great morals behind it all.
5,Allana amazes me with fierce courage.,"Allana is an amazing girl that wants to become a knight. She runs away to a knight training school. Read her adventures, otherwise your missing out,people!"
2,choppy with lots of erros,"This book started with a great IDEA. I liked the idea of Allana becoming a knight in her brothers place. It sounds like a book that can have SO MANY possibilites. However, the auther's choppy writing and typing errors were just sad. The author moves from one scene to the next, with no flow whatsoever, and simply skims the surface of the character's identity. There is no depth, and no description. It is almost a simple statement of facts throughout the whole book. Though I really want to know what happens in the series, and HOPE very much that the auther's writing has improved, I think I'll just look at the library for the rest of the series."
3,It was okay . . .,"This book was pretty disappointing - the heroine was SO predictable with the way she acted. It's pointless! Nowadays, all the heroines are striving to be ""tough"" and falling in love with everyone in sight and still unable to decide when a proposal comes along. This explains her attitude throughout the whole quartet, but I just wanted to say that here to warn readers: don't get your hopes up too high.The book itself is good, with a well-worked plot, but the heroine is just barely tolerable! I almost didn't want to read the rest of her books! Oh, well, I'll leave you people to make your own decisions about this book. Read it! (Even if Alanna is a stuck-up, bratty player!)"
4,"A terrific,imaginative book.","Alanna,Song of the Lioness,is more than a book.It's a playground for imagination.Tamora Pierce gives the outline-you do the rest without knowing you're doing so.Once you start all your freetime is spent with Alanna,from friendship to sword fighting.A TERRIFIC BOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,the struggle to make it in a man's world,"So many reviews already, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score.I actually read this in high school and it made quite a huge impact on me since it was the first of its kind that I read. Since then, there have been many stories with similar elements. This one is still very good but I prefer the Immortals series which was somehow less gritty and depressing (to me, there is very little humor, but you follow her growth and struggle to reach her dreams in a man's world.)"
3,A okay read and little development in characters,"I read this a while ago so I'm going to keep this short, commenting on only what I find memorable.One, Alanna was a likable protagonist, full of strong spirits and spunk and good nature. However, she's the only one who seems to have any personality at all- besides some few minor character who you'd think would have LESS personality that the main characters. Besides George, many of the people are unmemorable in my mind.Two, Tamora Peirce is a great author. Her descriptions are clear, her writing smooth.Three, Again, why can't Jonathan have a little character besides being the perfect prince?Thus ends my short summary of Alanna: The First Adventure. Medeaval"
5,Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's about this girl who wants to be a knight and has to pretend to be a boy. She undergoes hardships such as a bully, a magical illness, and fighting demons. Still, she is determined to become a knight. As one of the prince's best friends, she works hard to keep her secret and earn her shield. Her friends, including nobles, the prince, and the King of Thieves, help her in achieving her goal. But someone is out to get Prince Jonathon, only heir to the throne. Can she save her best friend?"
1,Basic moral values,"Is no one bothered by the essential lack of values in this book? Getting what you want is more important than honesty or respect for others. The main character threatens others with horrible, supernatural punishment, tricks her father, lies outrightly, and that's just in the first chapter.What about integrity, justice, truth as foundations of doing right?Compare this heroine with Jonas in The Giver, Frodo in The Lord of the Rings, Andy in Wolf Rider, or Karana in The Island of the Blue Dolphins."
5,Talk about the life of knights...,"This was a perfect book for me. I don't like to see people dying, but I DO enjoy hearing about it. I enjoyed this book. I even am lending the book(s) to one of my friends they are so good. We agree- the are great!"
5,THE BOOK TO SET THE STANDARDS,"Alanna was the first science fiction/fantasy book that I ever read, and since then I've read it at least one thousand times! Before I buy a book now, I think of Alanna, and that's how I judge it. If it's not as good as Alanna, then it's not worth buying. The tale was marvelous and well told, and no one but Tamora Pierce could have pulled it off. I've read all of her books, and am eagerly awaiting the next books in the Tortall serries. If you haven't read Pierce's work, then you just haven't experienced the non-stop adventure, romance, and just plain good writing that is expected in a book."
5,If only she would write more often. :),"If you've ever indulged in fantasy works and never come across Tamora Pierce in your readings... I suggest you get your booty on down to the local bookstore (or Amazon... god bless them) and check out a copy of this book. To date she's written 10 books in the series (concerning 3 different characters), exploring the country of Tortall and it's surrounding neighbours. It's simply amazing. I'm 18 years old, and have a friend 2nd year university, and we read these books. That's how good they are! The plots can be simplistic... but they're enjoyable and engaging. Once you start one of these books, you simply cannot put it down. One reason I loved this book in particular was that you get to see Alanna as her younger, stubborn self. Please, if you have any joy in reading... go out and buy this book, you won't regret it."
5,Great Beginning of a Great Series,"Despite the fact that ""Alanna"" had such a common story line (a girl pretending to be a boy so she can be a knight), it was really very different. Parts of it were rather funny, like when Alanna goes nuts because her chest got bigger. I think girls would appreciate ""Alanna"", as it's more of a girls' book."
5,"Wonderful book,I loooooooooved it!","A wonderful book!Alanna does not want to be a sorcerer,but she is being sent to a sorcerer school... But Thom,her twin brother ,wants to got to a sorcerer school,but he's going to King Raold's court to be a knight. Alanna's the one that wants to go to the court King Roald.... So...they switch places so Thom is going to the sorcerer school, and Alanna is going to be a knight! They have a few problems like making thier servant/partners know and agree. So Alanna of Trebond is going of to be a knight and Thom be a sorcerer. But it's not that easy being the smallest person around,and there's somthing sly and evil lurking around, and it could be somone the prince loves dearly.... So let these magical wings take you higher and higher into the sky!"
5,This book is great. Tamora Pierce is great!,Alanna is a great! She stands up for herself and lets no one push her around. She makes lots of friends (and a few enimies).This book is wonderful and I think everyone should read it!
5,A heroine that fails to disappoint.,"Admittedly a huge fan of the ""women-warrior, disguised as a man"" characters, I have been disappointed time and again by peoples take on them, but not this time. The take on magic, the involvement of the gods, and the world, which holds different morals, gave to a very interesting atmosphere for the books to be set in. Alanna is a character that I couldn't help cheering for, and identifying with.Granted as others point out, this is very obviously a first novel that will kick-off a series. And while I did enjoy it, I do prefer to have series of novels have the ability to be stand-alones.A terrific kick-off, to what I hope to be a wonderful series."
5,Another Outstanding Book by Tamora Pierce,"Alanna and her brother's thoughts are gloomy, when they think of their future. Thom is to become a knight, while Alanna is to be sent to a covent to learn to be a lady. They switch their places, so that Alanna will go to the Royal Palace and learn to be a knight, and Thom to the covent to become a sorcerer.This is a wonderful book that you will find yourself reading again and again..."
5,Wonderful read!,"This book is a wonderful read and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a real adventure. It is so easy to become absorbed into the book. Alanna is a character that anyone can relate to and you feel like she is your best friend. You can find yourself daydreaming about Alanna's life and wishing you could be apart of it after reading this book. The sequels to this book, and the other books by Tamora Pierce, are also wonderful and I recommend all of her books to anyone interested in fantasy! Once you read this book, you won't be able to wait until you've read the next!"
5,if you like...,"if you like adventures, romances, and girls standing up for themselves than this book is perfect. alanna hides that she's a girl and trades place with her brother, thom. she then goes to train as a knight. here she makes friends with the crown prince, and the king of the theifs. once you've read this series i would also recogmend the immortals series, this series is about another girl, but you also get to see alanna again, this time as an adult."
5,"THE Weird Sisters say, ""The best EVER!""","Hi there! We've just discovered this great place to submit reviews, so, here we go...Honestly, Sister 1 stumbled onto this novel four years ago at the local library..and loved it immediately. Sister 2 was finally hooked [after much effort from Sister 1 since Sister 2 was very reluctant to read a book with a character named Thom (she pronounced it with the ""th"" as in them, so she thought it sounded stupid)]However, we now both love the book and its sequels (except #3)for many reasons. First, Alanna was a great character: witty, pert(that was fun...that was lots of fun^_^), and such a short fuse (shake heads). George was funny! A super element. Sister 2: I liked Jonathan :). He was a good friend. Anywayz, the basic idea behind the story was very appealing (very feminist ^_^)and we totally recommend it!"
5,Alanna,Alanna is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a book of sorcery and fighting. It is about a girl who wants to become a knight. But before she can be a knight she has to be a paige. Also she has to learn how to become a knight. But worst of all she has to depend on all the boys. Can Alanna and her friends make it to knighthood? Find out in Alanna.
4,"great, quick read","I finished this book in a day. Although it sometimes feels a bit rushed and sketchy, the pace is, for the most part, really nice. Alanna is a really interesting character, and I enjoyed finding out how she was going to manage to get through her years of training to be a knight without letting anyone find out she was really a girl. It sometimes felt that the people around Alanna weren't very well developed (I especially wanted to know more about her friends), but Alanna herself was usually enough fun to read about that that didn't really matter. I'm looking forward to reading the next book and wish I had just ordered them all and saved myself the trouble."
5,"THE ABSOLUTE BEST SERIES IN THE UNIVERSE, I LOVE IT!!!!! :)","Even if you totally despise fantasy you will adore this series, I'm POSITIVE!!! I read the book in 1 and 1/2 days. Then I was frantic to get the next 3 but of course, with my luck, they were all checked out....... :( I was thinking NO! I was so p.o.ed. Finally my mom took me to the bookstore and I practically ran to the Young Adult section and found In The Hand Of The Goddess and The Woman Who Rides Like A Man. You can't put the books down, seriously, it's like you're under a trance... I LOVE ALANNA AND HER WORLD, THEY RULE!!!!!! Anyone who thinks the same, you're awesome!!!! (I wish there were 1000000 star ratings...)"
4,A fairly basic beginning,"First of a childrens' fantasy series, this is the story of Alanna, a pre-pubescent noble girl who conspires with her twin brother Thom such that they each get sent where they want for training--she wants to be a warrior knight and he wants to be a sorcerer. Alanna changes her name to Alan and heads off to the castle for knight's training in Thom's place and he heads for the convent to begin training his magic Gift. This is made possible by a father who is a scholar with his head in his studies and somewhat indifferent and inattentive to his children.Of course trouble starts brewing the next year when ""Alan"" begins developing into a woman, but she is determined to find out what her dreams and visions of the black city mean. While this was an okay story, the writing was just a bit too simplistic and ""young"" for me. It only took a couple of hours to read, and while I think it would be a good story for children, I don't think it's a series I will pursue."
5,a great read,"This book is wonderful. It explains Alanna's life with great detail and suspense. Once you read this book, Tamora Pierce will be one of your most favorite fantasy writers. If I were you, get this book!"
4,great book,This is a very good book but I think she Tamora Pierce) made the book take place over to much time for so short of book she left out to many essencial details. It was like one day she was the worst at something and the next she was the best at everything. time just seemed to fly.
5,Read and PROSPER!,"A girl named Alanna and her twin named Thom, decide to trade places so that Alanna can become a knight, and Thom, a sorcerer. During this trade Alanna finds that she has magical powers and also meets two lovers. I thought this was a great story for those who have a romantic mind. Actually for anyone at all!"
4,I enjoyed the book Alanna the first adventure,The book of alanna is great. I really enjoyed it although it is mind boggeling from the start. you really need to read on to understand the story. Tamora Pierce must have had to think long and hard to come up with the caracters and background.It was great to read and it gave me something to do when Iwas bored. the book has lots of action and adventure but with of passion. The actually reminds me of the tail Jaon of ark . Mabye Miss Pierce was thinnking the same.by William Baird
4,Parents beware,"I thought this book was wonderful. However, it is not appropriate for children under 14. The reading level is not that difficult, but the content is for upper grades. This book inadvertently appeared on my daughter's third grade reading list. She did not understand why Alanna's sheet were ""smeared with blood"" She also had lots of questions about fertility cycles, sleeping with men and getting pregnant."
3,its ok,"i first got this book in 4th grade and i loved it and the entire series. in 5th grade i loved it, in 6th grade i loved it, in the brgining of 7th grade i loved it, but now, reading it for the 6th or 7th time, i realize how badly written it is. yeah, i know its for kids, but still...anywho, other than that, its a great book"
2,Disappointing,"Granted, Tamora is a good writer, and the action is exciting, but if you, like me, don't enjoy watching main characters move in and out of sexual relations with each other and others without long-term commitment, you will find this a disappointing read."
1,I wish I could give it negative stars.,"I agree with those people who have given this book negative reviews. I am amazed at how popular this series is. Not only is she a bland and wooden writer, Pierce is also an irresponsible one -- particularly in her depiction of the sex scenes that occur later in the series. Why were they necessary? Definitely not appropriate (not to mention, excessively dreary and boring). Please, please read some other children's fantasy, such as Garth Nix's ""Sabriel"" or Pullman's ""Golden Compass"" or Patricia C. Wrede's Enchanted Forest series. Far superior writing, plots, and character development. All these books have great female heroines who are far more three dimensional and original than Alanna."
1,BLEH,"I didn't like the book at all. I feel that she has trite storylines and unimaginative plots and characters. I feel that their are better writers of children's fantasy out there--like Diana Wynne Jones, an awesome fantasy writer who does not get enough recognition. Tamora Pierce does not have the same range of artistic creativity and imagination that Diana Wynne Jones displays in her books."
1,Heroine hops into bed with just about every male character,"Although I felt the storyline was pretty good for the four books in this series, I was very disappointed in the moral standards. As the heroine gains new skills and new experiences, becoming a superwoman, she fails to develop one of the most important qualities: self-respect. A lot of bed-hopping, little romance. A poor example for todays teens."
5,"Wow!! If you havn't read this book, you MUST!!","Wow! What can I say about such a great book?Tamora Piece did an amazing job creating the character Alana. Alana is a great book, combining adventure, trama, fun, and some affection between characters, which you could consider childish romance, that is extremely appealling and charming. Though the age says 9 - 12. I know for a fact that readers of ages from way older that that will love this book!Alana, disgused as a boy, goes to learn to become a knight. Being a girl she must be strong enough to cover up the truth. She gets picked on an older boy, who is full of himself, but she stays strong and with the assurance of her many friends is able to handle him.She makes her way through friendships and somehow learns more about the person she really is.I truly congratulate and thank Tamora Pierce for this great book she has written. If you like this book be sure to read the rest in the series and the Immortals series!"
5,REALY GOOD BOOK!!!!!!,"These books are the best I ever read and Temora is my favourite auther and i am am looking forvard to read her book ""Wild magic""."
3,Kids love it. Parents hate it,"My kids LOVE Captain Underpants, but I've found out the hard way that they don't make for very good read-aloud, bed time books. Be warned : These books are set up in comic strip form on a lot of their pages and without showing your kids EVERY page of the book while reading it, they'll be lost in the story. They're really good books, don't get me wrong, just not very good read-aloud book unless you are sitting in a circle or prepared to do the 'finger under the word as you read' type thing. My four and six year old LOVE them though."
5,Delicious fun!,"Barbara Metzger has done it again! I howled like Alex, the dog from beyond the grave, the entire way through this instant classic. The draw here is not only the charming romance between Maylene and the earl, but also a cast of characters that are sheer fun. Queen of the One-liners and Goddess of Alliteration, Metzger gives us the wittiest writing in the Regency romance genre today. Relish every word of *Ms. Metzger's Talent* in this keeper. It'll be too long until we get another."
1,Hedgehogs cannot digest corn,"From what I've been learning about hedgies, this food would be highly unsuitable for their dietary requirements, as they cannot digest corn and this food contains corn-based ingredients at and near the top of the list. A cautious hedgie owner would be advised to learn what their hedgehog's dietary needs are for fiber, protein and fat; a well-selected dry kitten food combined with occasional vitamin suppliments and fresh-food treats would be a much better choice."
1,Horrible,I wasted my money it went to the garbage because he couldn`t eat it cause it was to big and too hard for his little teeth and mouth and it stunk so bad that he shyed awat from it.. I didn`t even want to rate it at all..
3,Cardin Watch,I got the watch like a week ago. One of the stems has come out already :-( Not the quality I would expect from Pierre Cardin!
3,Doesn't shine for me anymore,"I purchased this watch for my wife as an every-day watch. It fits nice, has a good latch and works great. It's a little thick for my tastes.My only complaint is that it seemed a little more sparkly on the Amazon picture than it was in the box. The outer case is basically just textured metal.She liked it though."
4,Nice Watch..,The watch was slightly smaller than I had anticipated... None-the-less the watch is great for the price.. The dial is also really nice..
1,Not what the picture shows,Hi I just received the watch from Amazon.And i am very dissapointed with the quality. It does not look anything like what is shown in the picture.The watch is really dull and banal even for the $45 price.I would recommend not to buy it unless you can see it first hand.
3,German psalms and Missa Duplex,"Stoltzer is one of the earliest German composers to have set Psalms in his own language. You won't find here the celestial disco which is the effect of Schutz's Psalmen Davids, rather you get a sober account half way between Latin motet and Lutheran chorale (what you would expect in other words). The recording has dated a little, but the reserve is more in the pieces than the performers.13 tracks. Timing 73'25. Recorded 1974 ADD. ..."
4,bumpin Jam from Midnight Star,"back in the day Midnight Star had some cool Dance Floor Grooves&Jams that could truly rock a Dance Floor.""Freak A Zoid"" was a tight Jam for Pop lockin,Wind Mills,Moon-walking."
3,ok but nothing great,"The picture makes this shade look like it is fabric, but it is that shiny aluminum looking type material, not real cloth. Looks much cheaper when you get it. but it does the job, just looks cheap"
3,Caution,"This product does not even stay in place properly. Please look for better ones in stores where you can try, check and test out before you buy."
3,Horrible quality,I just needed it as a shoe rack so I ended up keeping these shelves but otherwise these are just horrible quality and not sturdy at all..
3,You got what you pay for~,"Well... It is not a bad product...But, when I open the box, some parts of the wood were broken...not very serious, but there are pretty obvious... you just cannot ignore themHowever, I am too tired to ship it back and wait for a new one...and I manage to hide most of them in the back side...which means I don't have to see most of them all the time... :PTherefore, I decide to accept the way it is.After all, the price is really cheap... and just as the title, you got what you pay for~To assemble this bookshelf is somehow not very easy, and plz plz plz plz don;t forget, if you buy this product...plz do make sure you put the ""narrowest piece"", which should be placed in the bottom front together with the top piece and botton piece first, before you assemble the other ""sidewall"". or you will end up with one extra piece and have to dispose all of them and reassemble the entire shelf again...:D"
1,Disappointing,Was not happy with this product at all. Poor quality make up and unsteady when put together. To top it off in order to return it the company says I must pay for return! Waste of moneyI marked 1 star only because it didn't give me the option to not mark any
1,Good for the money but poorly packaged,"Not too difficult to put together and about the quality one would expect for the price. However, poor packaging created damage to one entire corner. The outer cardboard was intact so obviously it was the poorly designed package that caused the problem. Not recommended at any price."
3,OK if you can get it in one piece.,"Ordered two of these bookcases for a vacation home. BOTH came damaged-gouges & scratches in the wood from where the boxes had been dropped and damaged. After calling I was told they did not want a return, but if I could make 1 decent bookshelf out of the 2 packages, they would send me another. I did get the 3rd (undamaged), but don't necessarily think that's a good way to do business. The bookshelves themselves are ok, look nice enough for my needs, but those paper backs they use anymore have got to go. They always warp after a while. Don't know if I would recommend these unless you're using them for your kids and don't want to worry about them being damaged."
3,Not bad,"When I first heard of this album I thought, ""Not another orchestral Queen album!"" but this was a surprise. David Palmer arranged these tracks in a fresh way. Also included are tracks never done by a full orchestra (""Innuendo"".)Setting it apart are the ""Prelude"", ""Interlude"" and ""Postlude""...looking at the track listing makes you think you are reading the night's set list from a full orchestra's performance.The album sleeve is also refreshing and artistic. At least they didn't use the ""Queen Crest""....AGAIN!Some Queen songs translate nicely like ""Love of My Life"" but rock songs such as ""Now I'm Here"" strain for credibilty.An OK album but the best of the Queen/orchestral releases."
5,"Cheap, Good and Solid","...Queen's classic. While remaining tuneful to the original, the big orchestra sound and fresh arrangements added ambience and excitement to the music. Check out the jazzy ""Death on two legs"" and the vibrations of ""Killer Queen"" (with interlude of Bohemian Rhapsody). Awesome.Its Solid coz its recorded with Sony SBM 20bit technology for audiophiles who are particular about sound quality.This is a treat for all Queen fans and anyone who wants to relax with over 50mins of great music."
1,Not so good,"I brought this and it was fun,but it does not have refills!So don't might if you want to use it lot of times."
3,"Not great,but it's just a toy",People forget that this is just a toy.It can't make lip gloss like the ones in stores!It really does not smell.Kind of smells bad.You have to shake it good.I think it should not be $22.00!Just buy it in a sale.
1,lets see how good,i think this toy is ok but refills cost more thank real makeupand it is not even shiny it is a bit messy too dont buy this prodect!!!!!!!!!!
3,OK I GUESS?,It isn't the best toy in the world you would need a poffessional lip gloss maker if you wanted real good lip gloss.
4,My 6&9 year olds LOVE this. Parent supervision needed,"My 6 & 9 years old kids LOVE this. It was a real hit. It is unfortunate that the kit only has supplies for 4 tubes. By the time they really got the hang of it, we were out of supplies. None-the-less. The kids were enthused. It could be messy if not supervised by a parent."
5,Great.NIce Idea,"It was great.IT was fun.The lip gloss cameout great.You pick the color,the flavor and addsome gitter and close it and shake it.Make sure you close the cap tight or elseit will spill.THat happened to anotherreviewer"
3,cute,I think it's cute!It's very small and not heavy!THe thingis the your lips don't look shiny.It's easy to make.Even though it can get messy.You put color glitter and flaver.It smellsgood!If you don't close the top tight before you shake it it will spill out and make a mess.It takes about five mins.Cute!
2,To have to Hold,The book arrived and when I opened the package it was tattered and torn. It was so bad it shouldn't have been resold at all.

1,Tiny sunglasses,"I love Hoven sunglasses, I've owned 8 pairs and they are my current everyday specs. The Risky glasses look like Wayfarer sized but are tiny, child sized."
5,Adorable addition to any bathroom,"I purchased this seat cover to complement my duck-themed bathroom. I've owned it for six months, and I have no complaints. The seat cover stays in place nicely, is well made, and has a nice plush head, just like a regular stuffed animal. And need I mention how adorable David Duck is?"
3,Good for Campy Horror,"The quality of the films vary, but are still watchable. The Crator Lake Monster is hillarious. An actor trying to look and sound sophisticated, fake English accent and all. Clay-mation monster, backwoods brothers...it has it all. Every film has its own reason to watch it. Oh the Horror! Very enjoyable."
5,holds well,Great product for a small price. This little device was easy to install and makes the room more livable.
4,Into the woods,"Kathrin is sent to America from Germany after the death of her mother. She eventually comes to work for a woman named Violet on Summit Avenue translating fairy tales from German. Violet has secrets, and over a space of time, she begins to tell the young woman her secrets and the two have one night of passion. The confused Kathrin flings herself into marriage with an ambitious young man who fathers her child. She eventually leaves her husband and searches for Violet. Like a modern adaption of a fairy tale, Sharratt's novel is lush and metaphoric in places, and is evocative of the early part of the 1900s, right before and during World War I. It reminded me of Emma Donoghue's ""Kissing the Witch"", which also used fairy tales in a sort of modern retelling. I was especially impressed with Sharratt's use of the maiden/mother/crone dynamic. If you enjoyed ""Tipping the Velvet"" by Sarah Waters, then you certainly love this book."
5,A Beautiful Book!,"The very title of this work, SUMMIT AVENUE, makes one think of tree shaded streets, in prim mid-western towns at the turn of the century -- American's so-called ""Golden Age"". Yet Mary Sharratt weaves a tale that is as timeless and as far reaching as any being written today. Perhaps even more.The intimate level of detail -- my favorite scene is Kathrin's first day at the mill -- belies a smoothly written storyline, a depth of character rarely found in first novels. This is the sort of book that will speak to you, no matter what your own bounderies may be. Read this book. You will not be disappointed."
4,A Well Written Novel,"I have edited my original review of this book. Because while I,personally desired a different reaction from the main character, Kathrin, I've come to realize she behaved the way most young women in the 1800's would have.Kathrin is a young woman whose inability to think ""outside the box"" of traditional ideas, leds her to make some very bad decisions. By the time she realizes this, the course has been set and circumstances are such her options have become quite limited.Kathrin causes not only herself a great deal of unnecessary anguish, but tremendous emotional pain for Violet Waverly, as well.The book ends before the two main characters meet again, butknowing the characters so well by that time, I felt happinesswas surely within reach."
1,A disappointing plot turn,"When I began this book, I greatly enjoyed the lovely language, etc. However, midway through the book one of the main characters is discovered to have seeminly ulterior motives - we had thought she was gentle, giving and unselfish and apparantly had predatory designs instead. It was a great disappointment. I have only so many hours available to read, and I'm sorry I spent some of them on this book."
3,ok but.....,"Not sure how the reviewers for this rated it 5 stars while Sphongle's ""Nothing Lasts"" received 4.5 stars, the latter supremely more musical and interesting. I have an infinite amount of respect for Amazon reviewers but this one has me scratching my head."
5,P.S. I've Taken A Lover,"Patricia Lucas White has out done herself with this book! It is a page turner, keeping you guessing what the heroine is up to next. Needless to say I truely enjoyed this one."
1,How many shills does it take to review a self-published book?,"Once again, Daniel H. Jones, bereft of talent, experience and skill, shows us that even the worst books may be published if you're willing to foot the bill. But that is as it must be; a publisher would hire an editor and an editor would render such a book readable, consistent and punctuated,any one of which traits would mean that this book was no longer the author's product.I am always amused by self-published authors who feel the need to ask their friends to write 5-star reviews or, worse, make up profiles for the sole purpose of giving their own books 5-star reviews, as though the readers and consumers of Amazon are not savvy enough to know the difference between fantasy and reality."
2,Disappointing.,"This book is a very quick read, and touches on the most general concepts of digital recording. It packs a lot of information for such a tiny volume (it's only slightly bigger than your wallet), but unfortunately this doesn't leave room for much detail. At best, this book would make a handy quick-reference to keep in your back pocket during recording sessions. But as others here have noted, this is not a book to recommend for newbies who really want to get their feet wet in the fast-moving world of digital recording."
3,Holy Bible and the family lighting the way NKJV,"I was expecting to view the Bible on line at least one chapter. So this is not a fair review because I have not seen the Bible yet. However, I do know Kincade's work and absolutely loves it and enjoy it very much. I try real hard to purchase what ever I see his handwork on. So next time allow at least one chapter to be displayed or allowed to come up for view. Thank you for allowing me to get this far."
5,Absolutely Beautifull !,"The Thomas Kinkade Bible ""Lighting The Way Home"" is very nice.The artwork is absolutely beautiful ! My husband liked mine so much that I had to order one for him!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this Bible to replace a cheap one I had bought years ago that was falling apart and now this one is also falling apart only after just having it for about 1 year. I am so disappointed because it took me so long to copy all my notes to make it easier for me to study it and now, all the pages are falling off. I bought it because it is bonded leather so I thought it would last, but it's falling apart faster than the cheap one I was replacing. The pictures are beautiful but I didn't buy it for the pictures. If you plan on using your Bible alot, don't buy this one."
5,This is a great TV for a great low price,"I bought this TV at Sears, not at Amazon, and I paid $199 for it. What a great value! Contrary to the other two reviews posted for this TV, I think this is an exceptionally high-quality television. The picture is crystal clear and the sound couldn't be better. I replaced an old 13"" CRT TV with this beautiful device and wow, what a difference. You can't really go wrong for the price...I fully recommend picking one up."
2,Sound is horrible,"Why did I not listen to the other reviewers that said the sound quality was atrocious? They were right. The sound has an irritating, tinny quality that is most annoying. I stole the external speakers of my kids' computer and now the TV sounds fine. Now my kids' complaints about me stealing thier speakers have an irritating, tinny quality that is most annoying."
2,Poor sound and picture,"I would first like to say thanks to Amazon for a quick shipping and ease of returning this product. This tv was very disappointing, the sound was awful. The tv was to be used in my wife's office, however the sound was so bad this was not possible. Also, the tv was connected to our local cable and the picture was very disappointing. I would not recommend this tv unless you are going to connect extra speakers and use the better inputs (s-video or component). Very disappointing for the money."
2,SHARP MODEL LC-15SH7U,HI I GOT THIS TV AT PC RICHARDS STORE THE AUDIO SOUND IS VERY POOR NO BASS AND THE I HAD TO TONE THE COLOR DOWN TO -12 TO MUCH COLOR FROM FACTORY NEXT TIME WHEN I GET A BIGGER SET I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER SHARP SET.
1,it doesn't work,My tv doesn't work. I don't know why but it doesn't work since the first day. I have an uncle that buyed one and works perfect. Maybe is only my TV.
3,Please clarify: Does this have ATSC??,"The NTSC warning implies it only has a NTSC (analog) tuner. The specs say it has both NTSC and ATSC (digital) tuners builtin. None of the reviews comment on how the builtin ATSC tuner performs... somebody w/one of these plz advise, thank you!"
3,Just okay,The tv is the perfect size for my need. The sound is tinny and the picture is ok - not great. It was very easy to set up and program with just a cable cord.
4,Gorgeous book on National Parks,This is a beautiful book with a lot of gorgeous pictures. Just what I was looking for. Would highly recommend it. Others seemed to have too much text and/or too many drawings and/or black and white photos. This is truly satisfying for anyone who loves nature and America's National Parks. You'll look at it again and again. Makes a fabulous gift or coffee table book.
1,DANGEROUS!!! PLEASE READ!,"My grandson received this toy this year for Christmas. The day after Christmas (today) he came downstairs crying (he's two) and saying ""Burn, Burn!"". The handle of this trouble light was so hot it could not be held even by an adult! There must have been a problem with the on/off switch or something. My son took it apart and it had gotten so hot the batteries were melting inside and needed to be pried out. Battery acid was all over it. Even the outside seam of the plastic handle was turned a little brown.We could even hear it crackling and sizzling. They will go to the store where they bought it tomorrow. But please if you have this toy be careful. Who knows if this is a fluke defect or a batch defect. My grandson's hand was burned which is bad enough but it could have been their home!"
4,GREAT FOR YOUR LITTLE MECHANIC,"MY SON HAS HAD HIS LIGHT FOR 3 YEARS WE JUST RECENTLY CHANGED THE BATTERY, HE LOVED HAVING A LIGHT LIKE HIS DAD'S TO WORK ON CARS. THE ON OFF SWITCH IS STIFF SOMETIMES IT WAS HARD FOR HIM TO PUSH THE BUTTON. HE WAS 4 YR OLD WHEN HE GOT THE LIGHT"
5,WONDERFUL book,This devotional book is PERFECT and WONDERFUL for moms. I have read it several times and gave to many as gifts.
2,Too Thin,"The collection has too much spread across too much making it very thin in poetry content. I won't name individual poems as it's all in such good spirit but lines like 'The general his voice calm, his poise almost jovial answers questions shuffling papers he rarely glances at' sum up this collection. There are too many people jumping ahead of themselves trying to find something war-like to talk write about but then forgetting that this is a poetry collection. But maybe it's not. Maybe it's just '100 Poets Against War'"
3,This one is a toss up ...,"A Lady Betrayedby: Kate SilverReviewer: Pamela Ackerson, author of Home of the Braves trilogyIt's the three musketeers, female version. Courtney Ruthgard was pampered and spoiled. Pierre Tournay is a musketeer who seduces her, betrays her by throwing her father in prison and then she joins the King's Guard and becomes a musketeer. Underneath the turmoil of rebellion against the king, he has to prove to her that he really did love her.Interesting twists, with a good revenge plot. Enjoy."
2,watch band's steel treads catch on clothes,"while it keeps time I wish I'd known how easy it is for the metal ""threads"" in the band get bent, then catch on things and there is no way to replace the band. As usual amazon's delivery service was prompt."
1,Skagen watch,"Well, I can only tell you that I recently received a Skagen watch with this kind of band in the gold tone....and while I like the looks of many of the Skagen watches, the gold toned band in particular, began to look very dull, almost had a ""dirty"" tone to it within a few weeks after wearing it......and it cost twice as much as the Cizizen's eco drive charm bracelet watch that I purchased through Amazon that never needs a battery.....I would NOT recommend any of these watches with this band....and also....my Skagen was very similar to this one and I had an extremely difficult time being able to tell just what time it was...."
2,Clasp opens,I haven't worn this watch since the first week when i got it. The clasp opens and it falls off. Not a good connection on the bracelet part. It's attractive and stainless and that is what i wanted. I also wanted a watch that wouldn't fall off. No such luck
5,Not Tumeni Notes. Just as many notes as are required!,"Absolutely rich and sweet, and played with a very humanistic quality. I especially love the K.304: Allegro and Tempo Di Minuetto,with it's dark soulfulness subtly contradicting a lighter happier side. Great dynamics and feeling. And I appreciate the sense of presence in the recording,very clear and full with a perfect level of contrast betwixt the two instruments. I have three other versions of these compositions and this one's my favorite by far! Take it from an avid classical music listener,this one is special."
1,"Review of the book, not a critique of Poe","""The Raven"" is a well crafted and important poem. Unfortunately the edition it is found in here is not a well crafted book. I would recommend that you use your money to purchase a version which has higher production values. Take a look at one of the many other books which contain Poe's poetry."
3,Other Books,"Portentous crow dudes, and others. For fans of the horror end of comics, as well as The Raven and its Crow like links, this collection of Poe poetry also includes The Conqueror Worm.Out- out are the lights- out all!And, over each quivering form,The curtain, a funeral pall,Comes down with the rush of a storm,While the angels, all pallid and wan,Uprising, unveiling, affirmThat the play is the tragedy, ""Man,""And its hero the Conqueror Worm."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this to relieve neck and shoulder tension that builds as I sit in front of my computer all day for work. As every outlet near my computer is occupied, I needed something that did not have to be plugged in. This definately gets very hot in the microwave, in only 3 minutes, and holds the heat for about 15-20min. Stays in place around the neck and I also drop it down between my back and the chair to get some heat on the back muscles. The ""cherry aroma"" advertised is really more of a sour cherry - not totally unpleasant, but certainly not going to add any aromatherapy componant to this wrap."
4,A sparkling remaster,"This disc showcases a spectrum of talent from the young Schippers before his tragic death. However, contrary to the other reviews, this is not the best version of the ""Adagio"" that I have ever heard. The other tracks on the disc are a nice complement and some are hard to find on CD. All in all, a decent buy."
2,Not impressed,"Not worth the amount of money BSN charges for this product. At 6 tablets per day, the bottle only lasts 20 days or 3 weeks. It says it takes 6 weeks for you to notice the full effects and to only take it for 12 weeks at a time. At that rate, they should be charging, at most, half the price for this product. I took the contents of a bottle over the course of 3 weeks, noticed nothing and decided not to continue use. Disappointed."
3,Good,"Good product. Just wasn't what I wanted, but thats my bag. All in all I guess its a good product"
2,May have worked,"I'm not sure if BSN was trying to get into a market that flirts with steroids, but I took this as it reads on the bottle, and didn't see any diffrence in my workouts. I'm 32, 190lbs, in the military and hit the gym at lunch or after work, I gave two stars because the seller beat all the others prices."
1,B**ch-tits Pills,"Before accepting my crappy ectomorphic genetics, I wasted 12-13 years of my life in the gym, but before giving up I tryed this hoping itd be the one product strong enough to help even me. After two months of usin this in Iraq, I felt as though my arms were at their peak in my life so far, but that was probably just a phycalogical thing. This didnt really work...all these pills did was SLIGHTLY enlarge the area around my nipsies to a barely noticable extent...but I did notice and stopped using this product. Cause why take the chances of growing some embarrasing man-cans when it doesnt help put on mass anywhere else?! Ive read that that could happen when using testosterone supplaments, and Im an example of that. Luckaly I stopped using this before much actually happened to me. No positive results in muscle mass...just tits. Maybe a woman could use this in place of fake implants but I sure dont recomend this for any man out there."
4,Fears,"Stalking Wolf ignites a fear of him in Caitlyn. However she is afraid of her own secret feelings. Then Indians killed Caitlyn's four brothers and she has a fear and hate for them. After the death of her father she has only a scolding look for Stalking Wolf. This is a very fast moving story by a new author to me. I will be looking for another book from her. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
5,"Yeah, this album rocks if you were wondering,","There is some great music coming out this year and it is not by well known bands. Electrelane has created a solid album with songs that connect and yet experiment with different styles/sounds. The lead singers voice is beautiful. Similar to Tegan and Sara as far as the tempo. Finally, the band has a distinct sound that should cause people to take notice."
5,Cheerful Haydn Miniatures,"Wonderful CD, available as an authorized CD-R reissue from ArkivMusic, with excellent sound quality and a reprint of the original liner notes.You might also enjoy an import CD with Antal Dorati, titled ""Haydn: 24 Minuets""."
5,Crowds and Kazantzakis,"As I was reading this book I could not help but notice that there are some interesting recuring motifs and themes. The theme and motif of a crowd just shouts at you in this book. You can see it in Kazantzakis' favorite symbols rain, oceans,fire etc. He also mentions his ancestors in himself and carrying on thru in progeny. If you want to get the most out of this book read it along side of Canetti's Crowds and Power."
3,Nice!,"The paper-ish cape is really cool. It even comes in cardboard so that it won't get smashed or ripped before you open the box. The lightsaber is also really cool, and the droids are great!However, I don't like that the blocks that go in the back. They are just 2 really tall block instead of separate ones, even though they are hidden by the front part. I'll be tearing this apart and using it to build other stuff (like I do with all of my Lego and MegaBlok sets) and I like to have a lot of versatility."
4,cool,"This lego piece is not very educational.I really loved it, and it was really fun. Of course, with Legos, they are always really durable"
4,Has its ups and downs...,"Heavy on the beer-ad blues side of things, with sidebars that talk about ""monster solos,"" and a CD sampler that comes for the House of Blues. You see where this is leading, right? Nonetheless, this also includes admirable entries on artists such as Sammy Price, Victoria Spivey and Buddy Johnson, who might otherwise languish outside of the canon. Appendices include listings of blues festivals, labels and artist web sites, which may be useful to the up-an-coming blues hound."
5,A Timely Book,"For an author to be in a state on non-judgement around an experience like Vietnam is at a minimum an amazing process. Mr. Sherman simply takes a healthy proactive stance in solidifying his convictions in the midst of the runaway train called war. Writing this review at the start of yet another conflict fueled by the hubris of unexplored belief systems, this book becomes even more important in the obvious conclusion that in life, for the most part, we make it all up, and war is something that has reached the end its relevance in fueling devolution. This book represents a path my life could have taken, yet I doubt I would have had the authors level of courage. Thus it was a slow, experiential read, now a part of my gratitude for having not been to hell and back. The book takes us on a journey as if we had actually been on the journey, which is part of masterful writing. Just read it......"
3,"unique, interesting perspective of vietnam",I found the book to be a pretty sharp criticism of the U.S. Army and how it treated its own soldiers. The fact that Sherman was in more danger from his fellow G.I.s than the Viet Cong is very troubling but we hear these stories all the time.
1,Make Believe,"The author knows little to almost nothing about the aircraft he describes in the book and even less about Infantry operations in the field. Any pilot in the U.S. Air Force or U.S. Army would laugh at his descriptions of the wrong model numbers and flight characteristics. Either this is due to a lack of research or a very bad editor.Written like a very bad war story told at the club after happy hour, the lead in didn't even start with ""You're Not going to Believe This But'"" or ""This ain't No S _ _ _ But""."
3,Memoir or novel?,"Reviewer Mazza (11.15.04) mentions that the book ""reads more like a novel than a memoir."" Exactly, and that's the problem---which is it? As reviewer Bunch (1.24.06) notes, there are several events that don't ring true. For example, in 1985 the author and a friend visited a deserted Wall at 10 o'clock at night. As he knelt and wept in front of the name of a soldier whose life he had been unable to save in `69, who should appear but that same man's mother and brother (to whom he apparently said nothing). There are many books written by Vietnam vets. Read this one if you aren't troubled by repeated dramatic coincidences."
5,so varied in sound,edgar meyer is unbeatable at anything he does.and his partners on this cd just gel. every time i listen i hear more.
3,musicianship extrodanair,"I originally saw this album being performed on public T.V. with the Boston Pops. The T.V. show was better. The album does not have the Boston Pops performing. The musicianship is excellent. It was somehow more exciting and up tempo on T.V.. The album is easy listening morning music for me. I am usually a rocker, but this has opened my mind to new music. Jazz fusion fans should love it."
5,Critical success,"Where did this band come from? Or, more importantly, where have I been? The album Reves seems to be the Mexican equivelant of TNT by tortoise, and the second album has a more mainstream, yet still pastoral to the point of sublime. Their mastery of melody is remarkable; it is rare that you hear a hook these days that is completely fresh. Some pastoral music takes you to a familiar place, somewhere special, maybe nostalgic: this band takes me somewhere, but to a place completely new and foreign. It is very rare of a band to have that kind of effect on myself. This quality was present in early 80's era Midnight Oil, King Crimson, early Pink Floyd, and Brian Eno. However, never in this context. It is quite obvious that these people know what they are doing, and they are quite capable of the execution of their ideas. A must for those who listen for the true cutting edge of contemorary music."

3,A minifig set.,"Final Duel I is a nice little Lego set. It comes with two awesome minifigs: Darth Vader and the Emperor himself! Vader comes with his lightsaber and the Emperor is provided with a swiveling chair and ""TIE Fighter style"" window piece as seen in Return of the Jedi. Buy this set with Final Duel II to recreate the classic battle between Vader and Luke Skywalker. Overall a cool set. Good job Lego!!!!Tom, BIG Star Wars Fan"
5,May The Force Be With You.,"Hello Star Wars Fans,You wouldn't want to miss this cool Lego Star Wars set to complete your journey towards the Dark Side of the Force. ..."
2,"nice lamp, no dimmer!",I was surprised to find that the lamp has just an On/Off switch - NO DIMMER! And you can't even use a 3-way bulb (30-60-100W) - it's just ON or OFF. Who makes such a nice torchiere lamp with such a low-end light control? The lamp looks nice but is not good in nice areas where light levels matter. The manufacturers are either stupid or cheap or both.
3,Too Old,"For me, over 50, these puzzles were harder than the daily Wed. NY Times puzzles today. I think it is because these are older puzzles and the contemporary references are from the 60's or so. It was edited by Maleska, who was the puzzles editor before the current Will Shortz. They are challenging though....good luck."
2,Easy? Not!,Speaking as one who can usually get up to Wednesdays's NY Times puzzle before feeling inept; these Monday 'easy' puzzles would be totally demoralizing to the novice puzzler.
3,Thursday Crossword Puzzles,The puzzles in this book were created by Maleska a well-known creator of puzzles who died quite a while ago. They are harder than today's Thursday puzzles. They contain more obscure words and refer to much older movies and events than today's puzzles. I relish today's puzzles on Thursday but for older puzzles Wednesday is more my speed.
2,The New York Times Daily Crossword Puzzles: MONDAY or FRIDAY,"I think these puzzles are too hard for the user interested in easier ""monday"" puzzles."
4,My man loves this book...serious brownie points for me!,"I'm not big on puzzles, but my man loves the hell out of them. Does the NYT puzzle in pen, fer chrissakes. That's why I got him this book--the NYT Saturday edition. Yeah, he's come across one or two he's already done, but for the most part he's in puzzle heaven. It's paperback size, so he's been bringing it everywhere. He's happy, and I'm the best wife ever. Hah!"
4,A well-edited and challenging crossword puzzle book,"This book of ""Wednesday"" crossword puzzles from the New York Times is significantly harder to solve than earlier books in the series. As the week goes on each day's puzzles are designed to be harder to solve but I noted a greater increase in difficulty between this book and ""Tuesday"" as opposed to the differences between the ""Monday"" and ""Tuesday"" books. All the books in the series are well-edited and I have found no errors. The book is somewhat awkward to use since paperbooks are not the easiest format for crossword puzzles unless they lay flat."
5,A Horse among Horses.,"Single G was a great pacer. My great uncles, who were twins, trained and drove him. Their names were Ed and Hamy Allen. Ed was his driver. He made his fastest time when he was 13 years old. The only horse to beat his time was Dan Patch but the reason he did was Dan Patch used a wind shield when he made faster time. He was a great horse and much admired by racing fans and all who knew him.The book is well worth the read. My family has one of the sterling silver bowls he won in a race with the inscription on it. I saw him race once when I was a little girl with my dad. The race was at the fair at Huron, South Dakota. The book has many pictures of Single G and some with Ed Allen driving.Laura RobertsonBox 146Mission, SD 57555"
3,Food fight!,"Play cards from 0 - 9 to take tricks. The cards also have from 1-4 cans, which indicate their worth after all tricks are played. Your score equals the total number of cans on all the cards you took in tricks. Additional scoring can be had via the flags. The Catsup Cannon can eliminate a card from any trick when played. At the end of the game, highest score wins!A trick-taking game from 3-5 players (with partnership rules for 4 players). It's pretty fun -- not awful, but not spectacular.Oh, and the game comes in a can, like the old band-aid cans. There are four different cans (one for each suit in the deck, with that suit prominently displayed on the can). It's the *can* that's collectible, not the card game!"
5,Basic Tent,This is a really plain tent. Not too many bells and whistles. Relatively easy to set up and seems to be durable. With just features I would have given it a four but the really cheap price was what pushed it to a 5. I would say the target buyer for this would be a camper on a budget or the once-per-year camper.
5,Enchanting!,"The warm oil felt great on my skin. It's not too hot, just warm enough to make your skin tingle with excitement. I found the candle to be really relaxing when poured on my back. The oil makes the skin very moist and slippery..."
3,Possibly a Dud?,"I'm starting to wonder if I got a dud candle or something. I could barely smell anything from this, which is not usually an issue with Yankee. I got this sort of generic sweet scent, none of the nuances of sand and water that I was expecting, and barely any scent to boot. I may have to revisit this one, because my experience was pretty out of character for Yankee- their scents (even if I don't like them) are generally strong."
2,leaks too much,I got this hose on the summer and now it is already leaking on the hose grip! not even a year
4,Warehouse Deals or Warehouse Steals?,"This hose costs almost thirty bucks locally. Thankfully, we got ours for just over ten thanks to Warehouse Deals. Sometimes people just don't like something or don't know what they're getting in the first place, so they send it back, and that's when I swoop in and get a great deal. Keep an eye out for some good deals from Amazon Warehouse Deals. We've gotten many things at a fraction of their original prices, and they're perfectly good items with nothing wrong with them. This is a real nice quality hose, doesn't kink and seems quite durable. Really happy we got it, and even happier that it was a third of the local cost. Yaaaaay!"
1,Kinks and will leak,"This hose kinks easily. More of a problem is the fact that the layers seem to be separated. Under pressure, the outer casing is swelling up like a sausage. I made the mistake of buying several lengths of this, and more than half are swelling like this. They don't leak yet, but it cannot be long."
5,Does not disappoint!,Checked out several hoses and came back to this one. Glad I did! Price was right and hose is just what I was looking for. I bought it as an extension hose so I am connecting and disconnecting item regularly. Does so easily without issue. We've had some exceptional hot weather for our area (90-100 degress) and hose remains outdoors with no ill effect. I especially like the lighter weight and rarely get any kinks. Great hose for the money! Would not hesitate to buy again.
4,THE HOSE,tHIS hOSE IS A REPLACEMENT FOR A VERY OLD ONE.. i LIKE IT VERY MUCH AS IT DOSE A GOOD JOB''
1,not durable,"Bought this because of the great review. Unfortunately, after 3 months of normal usage (use it for just watering the lawn), it started to leak and we had to go buy another hose."
2,True Garbage in Every Sense,"Titled by Glimour as ""the last hose you'll ever buy"", I like to think it will be ""the last hose you'll ever buy from Glimour"". In their ridiculous attempt to make the hose kink-free, what they have created is a hose the doesn't bend or flex. It just keeps the shape of the coil from the hose reel. Even with warm water running through it, it still does not lay flat on the ground (creating a constant trip hazard and annoyance) or stretch to its full length. It is the most stubborn and frustrating garden hose imaginable. I've bought a few things from Gilmour and none have been satisfactory but this hose is true garbage."
5,Excellent garden hose...Superb value,This is by far the best garden hose I've ever purchased at such a reasonable price. Easy to use: does not kink and is lightweight. Would highly recommend for everyday garden use.
3,Mid-class hose at best.,"I have owned nice hoses before and this is not one of them. It kinks very easily, just like cheap hoses. Its fittings are nice and it appears to be made to last, but for the money I have purchased much better hoses that do not kink.Update: I have owned this for a over a year now and have bumped it up to 3 stars from 2. Yes it does kink doing sharp turn maneuvers such as when washing a car back and forth it kinks sometimes when I am walking and turn 90 or 180 degrees and drag the hose. The reason for upping the star count is I have again experienced how bad a cheap hose kinks, and this one is not that bad. (I owned a really nice hose at my previous house that was left there, I purchased it at ACE Hardware, but can't remember the brand and haven't been back in to look for it. This hose is good enough to get the job done that I need) Given this hose is only $20, I give it 3 stars now."
1,One of the hoses already tore,"It has barely been two weeks since I bought two hoses and one is already tearing. The manufacturer claims it is the last hose you will ever buy, not true."
5,Doesn't kink!,"After returning 3 different hoses to Ace, we purchases this hose, which we had used in another city where it was readily available. What a relief to find it online."
3,Kinked on first use,"My wife has been struggling with a 5/8"" 50 foot hose for a long time. I thought I'd surprise her with a lighter weight hose for her favorite gardening activity. On first use the hose kinked. We were both so disappointed. Now she is faced with either returning to the old heavy hose or dealing with the kink problem."
2,Not for pressure use,The hose bulged in several places upon use. I leave pressure on the hose. I guess it would be ok for low pressure use.
2,Nothing special,"I purchased two of these 50"" hoses a couple weeks apart, the 1st one is stationary connecting the 2nd to our back yard, the 2nd one is bad as it bulges in many places. I exchanged it for a replacement but have the same problem with the replacement? ...I'm not impressed!"
3,"Not bad, not great","I am using this hose daily for a vegetable garden. It has no holes in it, but when I use all the slack, and pull it all the way out, it leaks! It has done this since the day I got it, (only a week ago) so it's not from misuse. It just keeps leaking out at the spot that attaches to the faucet. It wastes water and is frustrating. Other than this issue, the hose works fine so far."
3,Gilmour 10 Series 8 Ply Flexogen Hose 1/2 inch x 50 Feet #10-12050 Green,"I love this hose. We have had it just over 5 weeks and the lining inside the hose has seperated . It still works, but the actual reason I bought it was that it wouldn't kink- and would be the best hose I ever bought. I had high hopes, but it didn't work out so well. I believe this to be a manufacturer flaw- so the Gilmour company needs to check it out- they probably have more than just this hose being faulty."
3,May be more for adults than children?,"Although the illustrations are delightful and fun to explore I was disappointed with the book. I bought it to give to my 7 year old grand daughter and I have not givent it to her yet. I feel this is a book written for someone who already knows a lot about Gallileo. Those who already know a lot will enjoy the illustrations, those who need to learn will miss the message."
1,Not a kids book - not a grown up book,"A book for adults written on a second or third grade level. Nice colorful drawings but written on a 'See Spot run, run Spot run' theme. Now worth the price. Thumb through it once and you're done. Good for taking up space on a shelf."
3,Not our best book on Galileo,"Our favorite book about Galileo is Jeanne Bendick's ""Along Came Galileo,"" but the illustrations in this book make it good to keep on the shelf. Beautiful ways of SHOWING Galileo's experiments, and a simple text, means that this book is *good* for read-aloud families with a variety of age ranges, like mine.The treatment of the Church vs. Galileo situation in this book is just a retelling of the urban legend: Evil, reactionary church holds its power only through the ignorance of its followers, so it must silence the genius of Galileo."
3,Fun for a little while,"We got into playing the Neopets online game, and when these came out thought it would be fun. It's pretty simple for young kids to play, and the cards are durable. However, my son got bored pretty soon with playing it. He likes the Neopets board game much better- still playing that one years later!"
2,Not a very fun,"I read all of the reviews saying ""what a great toy!"" and stuff like that, so I decided to go out and buy a pack. I got to toys R us and found I had enough money to buy 2 packages!($20) So I went ahead and did. When I got to the front, I found out they were on sale for only a dollar each!!! So I went back and picked up 6 more packages for a total of 8 sets! And had more than 10 dollars left to spend! When I got home, I quickly opened all of the packages only to find I had the same cards in all of the packages and found that they all had the same cards, exept for the bonus packs of 8 in them. I read the directions and all of that, but I did not understand what in the world they were trying to tell me to do! So now I have 560 cards and don't understand what I am supposed to do with them besides collect them. So I had to make up my own rules to a game I could play with them. And it isn't even fun. So overall, I was pretty disapointed."
2,Way too much for way too little.,"This toy was on my grandson's wish list for Christmas. I was very disappointed with this toy. For nearly $50 I expected more than a tiny box (maybe 4 x 6 inches) with a small number of pieces. The kids love their Legos, but this set is way overpriced for what you get. I would not purchas it again."
1,This is a great set- for $10,"I have to give the overall review one star because of the outrageous price. I have this set and paid about $10 for it. I cannot believe someone would charge over $60 for this. That is outrageous- I feel bad for the grandmother above who got ripped off. Yes, this toy is no longer in production, so fine, add a few dollars, but to scalp children's toys for literally six times the original price- and this goes for all they Lego Harry Potter sets being scalped on Amazon- pretty low.PS For all you Harry Potter Lego lovers- there will be new sets coming out in Fall 2010- see Lego website..."
1,A Devilishly Cheap Costume,"This costume is as thin as a slip. It is practically see-through. There are no wings or wand and to add insult to injury, they include a ""belt"" that looks like a strip of fabric my five year old cut out with her safety scissors.The halo is made out of dollar store xmas garland taped to a clear headband. We are going to use a white dress used a year ago for a wedding and buy our own wings and halo. Don't waste your money!"
4,Mediocre quality ... but my daughter loves it!!,"Fair enough ... for $10 you're getting a costume of pretty mediocre quality. Material is a bit sheer -- fine for dress up in the house but certainly we'll want something underneath before she goes out to a Halloween party. The dress has an unfinished hem (no hem, fabric just ends) at the bottom and the sleeves. (Neckline is nicely finished as shown.)That all said, my daughter (age 4 1/2) gasped when she saw it and put it on immediately. ""I look like a real angel,"" she sighed. In fact, it trumped a beautifully-made white Disney Princess ""wedding"" dress we had already borrowed from a friend. She even loves the halo -- it fits without pinching her head nor falling forward or backward like many headbands and a few halos we've tried.Yes, the product photo is misleading as this comes without wings and wand but we splurged for nicer wings than they would probably include and we happen to have a perfect wand already. I was glad this was ""a la carte."""
1,Not an angel costume,How is it an angel costume if it does not have wings? I completely wasted good money. Just put your child in a white slip or nightgown and make wings.
2,"Ok for pictures but just ""meh"" for anything else","Bought this for holiday pics for my two daughters...the wings were way too big for them (I bought proper sizes), we had to pin them together. They were also very floppy - we were constantly trying to get them to look right.Quality was also not that great - pretty cheap, actually. The costume served its purpose though, but I would not have them wear these if in a play or for Halloween, just too chinzy."
4,decent,"For $10.99, I wasn't expecting this costume to last long. My daugther wore it about 3x (once for a Christmas play) and it was still in decent condition. As previous reviews have mentioned, it is thin and see-thru. Just wash it in gentle cycle and hang dry. Hers is still in decent shape after 3 wears. The halo was pretty much done after the Christmas play, however. It does not come with wings as the photo shows, just the halo and think dress is what was in the package. My daughter is 60lbs and the Large size was perfect."
4,Cute,Cute outfit. But note- it does not come with wings. I should have read the entire product description. Still a cute costume for a church play.
2,NO WINGS!!!!,I needed thus costume for my daughters Christmas play. The description of the costume says wings included. I missed the fine print...there are no wings!
1,Not what I thought,"The costume is not worth the money spent. Very slim, see through material, no wings and the sash is merely a piece of material. Wouldn't buy again."
1,Horrible.,"They should not put wings in the photo. The product is paper thin and cheap, and looks good only in the picture."
3,angel costume,The outfit is kind of flimsy but I knew that when I was purchasing. Held up for what i needed it for!
4,Book,"Good story, but wish it was a bigger book with hard cover or available on kindle. Didn't realize it was probably an actual old print of story."
2,The Window,"This movie would be painfully slow for most US audiences. To me, it was a minute study of the uneventful."
5,Good book - recommended,"The author illustrates how truly mundane products can generate substantial returns if they are marketed vigorously. Merrick makes a career out of the most uninteresting products: military salary slide rules, transparent calendars for wrist watches, and his big kahoona, a rolodex style business card punch. Merrick gets into the details of each invention covering every step from product conception, prototyping, protecting, packaging, and marketing. It's a good read with lots of solid invention information."
2,Unhappy,"I received the above shipment, there was no invoice, no operating manual and after charging the two phones for about 18 hours I discovered that on one phone that I could not get a dial tone. I attempted to contact Amazon but was unable to do so I wrote a letter to the supplier bo li, 2749Glenhurst PL,West Covina, Ca., 91792-0000 who would not reply to my letter. The one phone does work satisfactory. I was not happy with the outcome.Teresa Carroll"
5,Great Phone,"This is my first Uniden phone and I have to say it's great, easy setup, except for the part of language, my native language is Spanish, when you are configuring the main unit, you can listen the instruction by the machine but the last item to configure is the language, so after you configure all you can listen in another language than english. That`s important just for the non-english user.The signal is nice, i Tried like 100 mts far and still can speak fine, even when you live some floors up.The handsets look very nice, the lcd screen is clear but th ID Call show the number calling just in the first ring, after that show just ""Incoming Call"".Buy this item with confidence it pay every cent and more."
4,clear sound,"A very good product at a very good price. I have used uniden before, and when itcame time to change residences, I decided to buy new..A Good choice."
4,CD and DVD printer works great,"This is the second R320 printer I have used and for printing CDs or DVDs it works great. The feed tray can get a little touchy at times, but there are few low cost printers out there that will do the job. Software included is easy to use and makes a great looking CD or DVD."
1,Epson stuff doesn't last.,"This is the 3rd Epson printer I've owned and will be the last.All three are ok at first - with as-advertised to mediocre quality, then after a year or two, stuff starts to happen. Mostly with the paper feed system. Nothing is more fun than paper ""jams"" on every page when you're on a deadline. If you like wasting your time fixing and dealing with printers, then this is your baby. If you'd rather just get your page and get to work, well... not so much."
2,Problems with jets clogging,"If you do not plan on using this printer as your primary printer. Printing every day, do not buy it. This is the second Epson, the first being a R200 that I've had that has problems with the jets clogging with inactivity. I bought both to print CD's and when they work they look great. But far to often I have one or more jets that are clogged giving me a worthless print out. To unclog the jets you are required to run the head cleaning routine that sucks the inks from the cartridges.Epson's support is slightly better than worthless. If you do a Google search on inkjets and clogging you'll find plenty of others to atest to this problem with Epson's printers. It seems that Epson uses a different inkjet technology that uses heat to produce the droplets of ink and it is prone to clogging if you are not using it everyday.I've wasted five times the cost of the printer in wasted inks. Unfortunately Epson's the only printer manufacturer that has the built in CDr print function."
3,Love this printer but printing CD/DVD is frustrating!,"Picture quality is great. This is by far the best printer I've ever owned. Considering the price and the quality of the picture it puts out... it's a great value! However, from the very start I've always found it a little difficult to print on CDs. Now after a few years of owning it, the printer will simply not print on CDs... it'll seemply rejects the CD trays. I don't know if this is a common problem on this model!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This printer has been buggy since day one. Then it seemed the ink ran out ridiculously fast, even when printing in black. Now it will not let me print in black when any other color ink is out, even with a fresh black cartridge! And no work-arounds are possible. A waste of my money, my resources and my time.This is obviously a case of a company not giving a flip about their customers.Epson will NEVER receive another dime of my business."
1,Waste of my money,Wouldn't work on either of my computers. Fried out the USB connections on one. Wouldn't work at all on the other with recently installed Windows 8.
4,Epsom Stlylus R-340 discontinued ?,"Epson R-340 is discontinued but if you liked the ever popular glitch riddenR-220, this could offer some solace. I bought this because I could nolonger find the R-220 . It is hopped up R-220 . I bought it because thereis no learning curve for me. The unit has some of the same glitches as theR-220. I love the ease and quality of printing DVD's with this line ofprinters. Great quality and easy to find 3rd party ink cartridges !"
1,There are MUCH better choices,"This printer was a gift(and I am grateful for the thoughtfulness), but darn it, if you're looking for a great deal, this one isn't it.1. every time it prints, it cleans the printer heads, wasting ink.2. it goes through ink quickly and you can't just keep on printing if one it out. Nope, it has to be replaced.3. You can't op NOT to print in color on the printers menu.4. Replacing 6 cartridges costs more that the printer did.I wasn't very impressed with the quality of the images it produced. I still love my Deskjet, and we've been using that instead.The one thing I do like about it, is that it feeds small items better."
1,Won't print,"We've been using this printer for awhile now and I haven't had many complaints. It's loud and slow but oh well. But NOW my black and cyan cartridges were empty, but I couldn't afford two cartridges so I just bought black. However, the printer won't print - even in black - because one of the cartridges is empty. So, I don't want to print in blue, I want to print in black but since my BLUE is empty the stupid thing won't print at all. I'm using the tax return to buy a new printer and this one can go in the dump, I'm going back to HP."
1,Perfect for the trash can or dump,"Marginal color quality at best. Takes 6 cartridges which are expensive and don't last long. Limped along until shutting itself down with automated message stating ""internal parts have reached service life"" (whatever that means) rendering the printer inoperative. It is now a boat anchor. We are stuck with boxes of Epson cartridges which will be thrown out rather than replacing this piece of junk with another Epson product."
4,Overpriced at this site,I like the printer - works fine but I'm wondering who is stupid enough to pay $449.99 listed on the Toyzz site? That's a TOTAL RIPOFF.
2,Not for Mac,"I was very dissapointed to find out that I could not print Microsoft Word 98 documents or any other files in Mac's OS X classic mode. The only way to do it is to completely restart in OS 9. I was also frustrated with the lines in the pictures. I tried everything in the manual to fix this, but nothing works. I gave up and returned it."
1,prints OK - but I took it back,"I bought the EPSON R320 30 days ago for just under $200, it is now is selling for $20 less in the same store. I took it back because it is a stupid printer, the default settings baffle me, if you swap between 8x11.5 paper and 4x6 photos you never know how your printout is going look. The printer seemed to go into lala land while using it, had to shut it off and re-power on to get it going again (then I had to reset the settings for the type of print I was doing). The software supplied with the printer ""FILM FACTORY"" is worse then useless; it seems it was designed to use ink uselessly. I got better prints just using MSWORD or the Camedia program that came with my camera. The store (FRYS) took it back and I bought a bubble jet at same price, which so far is working fine."
3,Good but buggy,The quality of the photos are great. However the printer often locks up when not is use for a while. Also found that any kind of magnetic device like a desktop speaker that is positioned near the left side of the printer will cause the printer to randomly lockup even during printing. The only way to unlock the printer is to unplug it.
5,The best digital photo printer I have ever experienced.,"I just purchased this photo printer a few days ago. I am blown away by the quality, speed, and ease of use. I am a previous owner of an Epson Stylus 925 ( I do not recommend buying this one, problems with the paper feed), but decided to buy the Epson R320 photo printer when I saw the reviews from this site and other sites. This printer is so much faster than my other Epson and the quality of the images are a world of a difference. I highly recommend this printer. Don't waste your money on other printers. This printer is definitely worth every penny. The best bang for the buck. Epson does not consider this a high end printer, but I surely do. I have been into digital photography for three years and have never seen anything like what this printer can do. I have a hard time giving products five starts because I usually find something wrong, but this time is an exception. Keep up the great work Epson."
4,Printer is great - Support stinks!,"The R320 is a great printer. Vibrant color and prints on DVD media without a single problem.However a word of caution to Mac users. You can NOT print out of Classic mode. There are some crazy workarouunds mentioned on Apple's discussion boards, but a ""workaround"" is not why you buy a NEW printer.Epson refuses to support the ""Classic"" platform because it is an emulation. Ummm, tell me again why that matters!Mac refuses to support the ""Classic"" problems because they want you to upgrade. Theoretically, Tiger fixes everything.So, the printer is awesome if you only need to print in an OSx environment. If you are still using ""classic"" apps on a OSx system...keep looking. (The above apparently does not apply to older computers that can boot-up in OS9.)"
1,Colors don't match!,"This printer is nearly impossible to calibrate to get true colors. I have used a Spyder to calibrate my monitor. However, after much fussing with the print settings, I still can't get it to produce colors to come anywhere close to the screen colors. The colors tend to come out muted or with a weird tint. I am using high-quality Epson paper (5 star).I have an Epson C88+ that is not a photo printer, but it produces much more true colors than the R320. Unfortunately, it uses pigment ink, which isn't good for glossy photos. Otherwise, I'd abandon the R320 altogether.I am VERY disappointed in this printer -- especially since it's by Epson, which has always created outstanding printers and ink.Don't buy this printer -- look for something else."
5,map,I travel a lot to different areas in San Diego & Riverside This Thomas Guide helps me to find my way around.
3,Disruptive Behavior Disorders in Children and Adolescents,"Robert L. Hendren, D.O. is editor of this paperback. He is a child and adolescent psychiatrist currently at the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry, and was formerly at Albuqurque, New Mexico. The book is a compilation of professional reviews on treating externalizing behavior disorders that include oppositionality, defiance of authority, spitefulness, vengefulness, and juvenile delinquency. It is applicable to both psychiatry, law and criminal justice. While scholarly, it is also insightful. There are minimal references provided. The paperback lacks in unity and continuity in its chapters. It is so expansive in its approach that its application becomes difficult."
1,Worst Game EVER!!!!!!!!!,"I had preivously played the Playstation version of this game and it's awesome!! Having only a few games for my Gameboy, I thought I'd buy this version. It's so horrible!! You're basicly riding stick people on bycicles!! The graphics are the worst and the music isn't that great. Trust me, spend a few extra bucks and buy the PS2 version!"
5,Just as needed,"Soundly made and fit exactly what was needed. Perfect for smaller desks where space is limited. Suitable for even those without a device, as spaces are easily used for any need."
4,Compact Thinline Edition (isbn 1581345445),"Five stars for the translation, 3 for the print and binding quality. I was impressed with the diminutive size of this version. The pages are post card sized. The text is extremely small, the myopic will probably want to steer clear of the compact thinline. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a considerable amount of time reading and studying. That being said, it is very portable. The red typeface is unnecessary and difficult to read. It fits in the back pocket of my jeans, but I wouldn't want to sit on it. I wish this Crossway made this size available with a better grade of leather cover. The bonded leather seems cheap and I've had Bibles of this quality fall apart on me within a few years, but Crossway has a lifetime guarantee on the binding. I'll use it until an edition of better quality comes along."
3,"Great ESV translation, low-quality bindings","I really feel that the English Standard Version Bible is one of the best translations on the market today. It combines a literal translation with great readability. For those who read the RSV, the ESV is a more conservative alternative to the gender-inclusive NRSV. I have purchased this ""Premium Bonded Leather"" Compact Bible. The bonded leather does not seem to be of premium quality. The bible paper used is not like the quality paper found in Cambridge bibles. However, I still highly recommend you purchase this version of the Bible for everyday study. It reads well in public or private worship settings."
5,Finally a Stormtrooper,"Finally, a Stormtrooper of my very own. This set is great if you are at all interested in collecting all of your favorite Star Wars figures in LEGO form. You can do just about anything with them. Personally, I decided to create my own chess set out of them. LEGO really has sold out in a way continuing to make less of the sets that used to make them great and instead showering us with imitative corporate syndication. But hey, I love Star Wars, so I'm buying them. Anyway, if you like LEGO and love Star Wars this is definitely for you."
5,Wish I got it years ago,"This set is very small, the majority of the pieces are to the minifigures. It has great figures, my son's favorite, Luke Skywalker with a robot hand and the storm trooper is always a cool figure. It is hard to find this set now for anything less than $25 (normally with shipping). It is a great to have for a collector or a star wars fan. I can only wish that I bought this when it came out, along with about 10 other sets with the 2-3 minifigures. I could not pass this one up... Too much of a classic."
1,"A bit of honesty, please...","Sadly, both Michio Kushi's wife and one daughter have died of cancer. Being that they were Japanese, the healthiest and longest lived people in the world, this doesn't really speak well for the diet.However, it does seem that macrobiotics, when taken with common sense, have been known to help cancer patients, some say to the extent of ""curing"" them. It's easy to find examples to prove everything and the contrary (and no one mentions the ones that have died of the various deficiencies that easily befall macrobiotics followers).Follow your own instincts... and keep in touch with a trusted doctor!"
1,welcome to the club,"This diet is not scientific, not really Japanese. Michio Kushi makes you put away meat, he should do the same with cigarettes. My mom read this book, spent [money] on personal visits, applied the diet (depriving herself of vitamins, protein), waited 6 month to see effects (while not seing the doctor), talked to a ""cured"" patient from Chicago (phoned her from Boston). Where is she now? Well, heaven I hope, but surely not among the living. If you are sick, see the doctor, and if you prefer to die with all your organs, at least buy something to spend your time well, and not this useless, lying book, the proceedings of which will perhaps be used in advertising this harmful ""diet""."
4,This set is a real bargain!,"This MP3 download contains all of Schubert's String Quartets. Even though the price has gone UP from when I bought it a month or two ago, it's still a great buy. Understand that these are mono recordings from the 1950s (Sound is adequate and not too much background noise), but if you are a Schubert fan, it's hard to pass up the chance to get all of his quartets in one fell swoop. The performances are excellent, and don't forget that Vienna was Schubert's home town!"
2,Try starting somewhere else,"This compilation of Adicts songs works for the casual fan only planning to buy one Adicts release, but the studio albums are full of great inside tracks that would be missed out on. I recommend starting with Songs of Praise or Sound of Music, and to go from there. I would avoid this, even though it fares all right, buying the actual albums is a better way to start for such an essential band in which most of their material is great, and that way you're not stuck with a ""Best Of"" and you can add on to your Adicts collection without repeating it self."
5,Down to earth,"This book is fast pace and right to the point. It talks about love,passion and pain; what most of us will do to get it. It talks about confusion in the lesbian community. And the ending wasn't happily ever after, which is apart of life and that's what makes Passion and Pain so real."
3,"Well, Its Bon Jovi...","Not one of the best ""Jovi"" songs ever to grace our ears, but Its ""Jovi"" none the less. Richie's Guitar work is up to standard and so's Jon's voice to that matter but what the song really lacks is umph, its just not there. Buy it because its Bon Jovi, but dont expect to find yourself singing along."
3,the future seems promising,"I felt that this wasn't quite BON JOVI at their best, but then again within the constraints of a soundtrack format they still admirably delivered the goods. I'm sure you'll all agree though that based on this track the lads might be returning to their golden roots of slightly faster rock'n'roll after the somewhat mellow offering of These Days. I hope to see them back to their best with this forthcoming album, I'll certainly ""Keep The Faith."""
3,Informative,"This is a good book, but the symbology of it is still somewhat difficult to understand, other than that, it is an excellent read."
1,Whose getting kick backs?,Either Amazon is now in the bargain bin release business or someone's gettin' kickbacks. Why are they sending us plugs for these forgotten movies on cheap labels at way too high prices? It's too random
5,Nephew loves it!,"I purchased this tractor for my nephew who is 1 1/2 and he loves it. He loves the little animals, the animal sounds and the Old MacDonald song. We've been using it to teach him the names of animals. Also, he's pretty rough with it and it's held up great so far."
5,Fun for a Boy or Girl,"This is too cute. I bought it for a girl's second birthday. It was one of the first gifts she opened and she wouldn't put it down for the rest of the party. Her mom had to open all her other gifts. If your little one likes trains, this is the toy to get."
5,So much fun,"My son loves tractors and was so happy to receive this for his second birthday. He loves putting each animal where it goes and driving the tractor, and also enjoys combining the animals with his other farm toys as well."
1,Junk,"This toy is flimsy junk, it broke in a couple of months of normal toddler use. Nice while it lasted but not worth it."
4,The Chosen One,"After a farm and tractor-themed bday party, out two-year-old received several tractor toys. This one seems to be his favorite and he took it to his first show and tell at school. The animals are cute and he has fun repeating the sounds each one makes. Worth the purchase."
4,So cute but pieces should stay put,"My one year old loves wheeling this thing around. We read about barnyard animals so it's something he relates to. I thought the animals stayed in their ""seat"" and made sounds when pushed, which would be soooo much cooler. Already not a fan of toy pieces and when he puts the cow in the sheep's seat he baaas which isn't accurate."
4,Well made - well designed,This was a gift for a 10 month old. The animal figures are easy for him to grasp...and he enjoyed unloading the tractor and cart but doesnt quite have the coordination to put them back in and hear the moos and oinks. He was highly interested to watch me do it and then he had to unload and taste them all again! A cute sturdy toy.The tractor and wagons do not come apart...which is fine for toddlers...less pieces and no frustration with keeping everything together.
3,"Love the product, But not a good shopping experience!","I bought this on Cyber Monday as a gift for my grandson. The price was reasonable, and I was not having to drive to pick it up. I was disappointed when it did not ""qualify"" for the free shipping (I thought the shipping was very expensive $20) but loved the little tractor set so I bought it. The next day I went on Amazon to show my husband the tractor set I had found and imagine my surprise when the tractor set was ""cheaper"" and it also ""qualified"" for free shipping. Needless to say I was not happy about that! I thought Cyber Monday was supposed to be a day for good deals. I feel like I kind of got taken just because I chose to shop on Cyber Monday. I still love the tractor set because my grandson really likes it, but was very disappointed in the shopping process. Not a good way to do business!"
4,Cute,"This is a cute little tractor train. When you press the animals or the farmer they make sounds. The sounds are not very loud, though. You have to be close to hear them. It moves around easily. My grandson seems to like it."
5,birthday gift for 2 year old,My friends 2 year old son loved this gift. He wouldn't leave home without it. It is very interactive and he loved the farm noises.
3,not as great as reviews indicated,bought this for 14 month old daughter. music and animal sounds are not too loud and is the feature she likes best. She gets bored with it rather quickly unless I direct her play. It is well made and will stand up to her baby antics. The animals are a little strange looking but recognizable. Hopefully as her imagination develops she will find more to the toy.
3,Basic Knitting - Review,"This is a good basic book for a new knitter -- or for someone teaching a child or other adult to knit. Experienced knitters might find it a bit simplistic, but it might be a handy addition to a knitting library."
5,SOFT WORKS 3-PIECE PLASTIC MIXING BOWL SET,THESE ARE GREAT BOWLS! THEY STAY WHERE YOU PUT THEM AND WON'T MOVE WHILE MIXING A CAKE OR COOKIES. IT WON'T MOVE WHILE MIXING A VERY HEAVY BATTER EITHER. I HAD ANOTHER BRAND FLY OFF MY COUNTER WHILE MIXING A HEAVY BATTER. WHAT A MESS! THE BOWLS ARE GREAT IN THE MICROWAVE AND WITH THE 3 SIZES YOU CAN PROOF YOUR BREAD TO RE-HEAT LAST NIGHTS SOUP OR STEW. I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THEM A LONG TIME AGO.
2,OK but not thrilled,"These bowls scratch very easily. Once they are scratched it is harder to mix ingredients and to clean the bowls.I will go back to melamine, glass or stainless."
4,Great bowls ...but...,These are great mixing bowls. The no-slip bottom and handles really come in handy. The only problem with the bowls is that they are not dishwasher or microwave safe. I don't remember seeing that in the description or I would have reconsidered my purchase.
4,After using heavy glass for years - these are awesome!,"These are especially handy, given their ease of use, now that my 10 year old is interested in whipping up brownies and helping me cook."
4,Nice bowls - not microwave safe,"These are nice bowls - the pouring lip & non skid bottoms are a real plus. However, I wanted to use these in the microwave, and they are not microwave safe. The description does not say this & you don't find this out until after you've purchased them."
5,Cool black and white non slip bowl set,"I had a set of nested lightweight bowls, that had a bit of a pour spout..butnot enough...I was still pouring 1/2 of my product on thecounter top..decided to find another set that actually worked!These do! And they do NOT slide around on the counter/table top either.A nice set for newlyweds setting up house. Just watch that you don'tdo what I did, I thought there was another larger bowl and ordered it(well, you might actually READ...I guess I didn't!) so I ordered and nowhave another of the largest bowl in this set...but that's not all bad =)This is really a great set, another fine Amazon product."
3,Just what I wanted but.............,"The dishes were just what I wanted however, 3 saucers were broken. I have tried several times to contact Bealls only to have recording. NOT happy with the service I'm receiving. Will let you know about service if I ever get in touch with them."
1,Ripoff,"Beware do NOT purchase this version of this DVD, make sure it is from Republic Pictures and is authentic.....this version is a cheap reproduced DVD from either a VHS tape or some other format......I will never purchase anything more from this seller....Very disappointed to say the least....."
1,IT STINKS!!!,"I am a huge fan of the Marx brothers. I own all of their movies except ""Love Happy"" and ""At the Circus"". They both stink. It's not the acting, it's the writing. The story is really terrible, and the Marx brothers don't have the same energy they used to. They are in their late 50's to early 60's. It's really sad to see how MGM ruined them. I couldn't even finish Love Happy. Rent it before you buy it."
3,Bought this mainly for Vera-Ellen,"I bought this movie mainly for Vera-Ellen's dancing. Her tap routine during the opening credits is the highlight of the film, although the other numbers are good too. Marilyn Monroe makes a cameo appearance. As for the Marx Brothers, they are amusing in places, although I always liked Groucho best in YOU BET YOUR LIFE."
3,Love Happy,"This is a good collector movie as it is the last movie that the Marx Brothers made together. Secondly, it is neat to see Marilyn Monroe in a brief bit part as this was the beginning of her career. The movie has some of the Harpo, Chico, and Groucho slapstic and music. However, it doesn't appear to be written as well as some of their earlier movies."
2,Marx Brothers...the conclusion.,"This was the final act of the Marx Brothers and yes, it was their weakest film. I wouldn't even technically call this a Marx Brothers movie considering Chico & Groucho have no scenes together and Groucho & Harpo only have 1 scene together. Groucho also gets the lone scene with miss Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn Monroe appears on the screen for maybe 30 seconds and although I was never a fan of hers you could kind of sense a strong presence about her for that brief time she was in the movie. I couldn't enjoy this movie thoroughly with Groucho narrating and Harpo as the star. The plot was ok but it was an extremly bad ending and just not what you would expect from the Marx Brothers...their true last performance was in ""A Night In Casablanca"" which was actually a pretty good movie. This movie is just out of sheer curiousity for Marx Brothers and Marilyn Monroe fans."
4,MArx Brothers Romp,This film is not as well known as many others but has some of the usual antics and includes the surprise of seeing both Marilyn Monroe and Raymond Burr in early roles on screen. As usual Harpo steals the show with his antics and music.I love that little Harpo penguin!Marilyn is stunning!
4,Underated and thouroughly enjoyable,"Many people hate this movie including Groucho Marx himself. But I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's not one of the best Marx brothers movies, but it is quite good. It is often very funny. Groucho has a smaller part, but he's had the biggest role in all the other Marx brothers movies, so I Harpo and Chico deserve one movie for themselves, and they're good enough to carry this film. I don't even think this is the worst Marx Brothers. I actually think THE BIG STORE is their worst, but that one is good too. I don't think the brothers ever made a movie that wasn't good.Overall, if you want some entertainment, this is a good one to watch. And it's a good one to buy if you, like me, are a Marx brothers fan.The bottom line is, this movie is good entertainment. It's no DUCK SOUP, but how could it be?"
1,Save a fish from drowning,I didn't like this book. It was hard to read. Not interesting. Unbelieveable characters. Our book club did not enjoy it either.
1,Smells Fishy,"What a disappointment. I have seldom quit reading a book in the middle of it. It became a chore to read, so I put it down about half way through. I just did not care about any of the characters. I was embarrassed by some of their words and actions. I am so glad my recent trip to China included an intelligent, well educated, and knowledgeable group of people, so unlike the group in this book."
2,What a disapointment.,"This book doesn't not follow the pattern of other books she wrote. I've read all her other books and I love each one. I couldn't wait for her next book and sad to say, this one is a bummer. This book goes on and on about nothing. I couldn't figure out what the story line is. The characters get lost in my mind. Can't figure out who's who.I hope her next book will follow the same pattern as The Joy Luck Club, Kitchen God's Wife, The Hundred Secret Senses and The Bone setter's Daughter. These books are a must read.Saving Fish from Drowning, I advise you to skip."
2,Wannabe history lesson,"This book's aim seems to be to teach us about Burma past and present; but as a novel, the characters are not developed enough to make us care about them or Burma within the muddled and tedious story -- it felt like a mediocre TV sitcom. Tan's writing style is always engaging, however, and for that I give the book 2 stars."
2,Not great,"I did not enjoy this book in the least. plotlines were ludicrous, characters were smarmy, and some references to the native people of Myanmar were racist."
2,High Hopes...,"I generally like Amy Tan's writing style and her books. Her books are usually engrossing with many interesting details and unforgettable story lines...a rare glimpse into the Asian culture.Saving Fish From Drowning proved to deliver quite the opposite. I found it hard to keep the characters straight, the storyline uninteresting. I read it to the end hoping it would turn around or come together at some point, which it never seemed to do.While I didn't hate it, I also wouldn't recommend it."
2,Can't even finish it,"I have read all of Amy Tan's other novels and liked them and her writing so much that I have been to see her speak, taking the trouble to go two hours early to get a seat. I am about 50 pages into this book and have been wondering since page 1 if I was going to have to listen to the main character's snooty portrayals of her ""friends"" throughout the novel or if it would ever expand. In skimming later chapters for ""the voice"", it seemed like Bibi was there forever. So I decided to check the Amazon reviews to see if I should move on to another book with better writing. And, it appears that my intuition served me. I am so disappointed; I bought the book and took it to my reading nook with the relish a child has for a rare cookie. Oh well, better sweets next time, I hope."
4,A Deep Deep Amy Tan Fan!,"I love Amy Tan's books. All of them create characters and situations that are thought provoking, living in a mind set that is very different from anyone I know. Even so, at the end of one of her stories, we seem to know these characters and why they do what they do.Given all that, I think this may be her best novel yet. Full of mystical situations that seem perfectly natural, the ensemble of characters and what happens to them is exciting. The ending doesn't dissapoint. Read this book!"
4,Excellent and fun to read,"I am also glad I didn't read any negative reviews before I picked this book up. I also had difficult time getting through the first 150 or more pages, but being a fan of Amy Tan, I trusted she would make this work, and SHE DID!! Fantastic book, exceptional writing, funnier in the last 100 pages. She got me hooked. This book is not for the light hearted reader, but for the reader who likes good writing as an art and for provoking thought. Don't read the end, just read it straight through from page one to the credits."
4,She took a chance...,"I am a huge fan of Tan. Although this book was by no means her greatest, her previous work has set the bar rather high. The book is okay, it has interesting characters (perhaps too many, I found it difficult to keep track of who was who)and a unique plot. However, a word of warning, as far as I know, this book is nothing like anything else she has ever written, it is not the traditional Amy Tan novel, so if that is what you are looking for, you had better just reread the Kitchen God's wife or the Bonesetter's Daughter. I give her 4 stars for stepping out there, too many novelists stick with a basic plot and do not stray far from it, but not Amy Tan."
2,What happened to Amy Tan?,"I LOVE Amy Tan's writing, but I found this book to be really disappointing. I was so excited when I read what it was about and figured it would be one of her best. But it was hard to become acquainted with the characters and remember who was who. The title plays out in a very interesting scene early in the book, but then it didn't seem like she really connected the dots throughout. Or maybe I just missed it! I finished it simply because I felt I might as well once I'd invested so much time in it, but I can't say I'm really glad I spent my time reading this one. Don't waste your time!"
2,Saving Amy from this type of writing.,"While I learned a great deal about Burma/Myanmar and went on to educate myself about its politics, I found the book not the usually Tan work. The characters were dense when they didn't have to be, lots of tangents that didn't need to go to. The parts of the story that I enjoyed were the storytelling regarding Bibi, her mother, her step-mother, Sweet Ma and her family's history. She starts off with that somewhere in the beginning chapters and finally ends on that note.I love her past work, I've read all save her children's books. I hope she goes back to her unique storytelling, where generations of families come alive."
2,Spoiled for this reader,"Tan's earlier works have a charm and gracefulness in their story-telling, but that is lost in this novel. It is clumsy, slow-starting, and tired (this time, the storytelling feels completey contrived). Tan's characters assert themselves as being authorities in Chinese authenticity--why?--I'm left feeling like she's perpetuating negative stereotypes. This is an irritating element evident in her other writing as well--it gets in the way of the story. Perhaps Frank Chin et al have some valid points in The Big Aiieeeee! and have ruined Tan's magic for this reader."
3,Semi-Disappointing...,"I have read all of Amy Tan's novels and this one really did not exactly fit the standards that Tan usually fulfills. The book started out interesting...(I have never read a book where the novel is narrated by a ghost) much different than anything else she has written, however I felt the novel was drawn out longer than it should have been. The end of the novel did not fit the climax that the beginning of the novel brought to the table. Though I was a bit disappointed, there was still some interesting ideas brought foreward by Tan."
2,Tooooo Much,"It seems that the more popular (and lucrative) an author gets, the less editing they receive on their novels. (Are their editors cowed by their fame?) Now Amy Tan, like her good pal Stephen King, suffers greatly from a bad or absent editor as evidenced by her latest novel, ""Saving Fish From Drowning"". It's a great story and deliciously witty with scathing pokes at, among others, modern society, the rich, religion and ""reality"" TV. She is particularly astute at satirizing American tourists. But the book would have been GREAT at 150 fewer pages and half as many characters."
2,not as good as her other works,I've read all of Tan's writing's and I was dissapointed with this book.I usually cruise through a novel in less than a week and it took me three weeks to get through this one.Everyone has a bad day sometime.
3,OK....but could have been shorter,"I enjoyed the audio version of this book, but it seemed overly long. The author does a good job narrating, though she could improve her British & German accents when voicing the pertinent characters! I for one am glad that Amy Tan is branching out from her usual Chinese-American, mother-daughter thing. Though the characters in this book may not come to life as much as in her other books (with the exception of the narrator & Harry) and the end becomes a bit too forced & farcical for my taste, there are still flashes of brilliant, almost poetic writing that move you."
2,Shocked to find it Silly and Simple,"I have loved Amy Tan's previous books so much, I stuck it out to page 380 before I finally quit. Then, out of guilt, I forced myself to finish it. That was two hours ago and I already forget what the book was about. So disappointing."
1,Tedious book about tedious charaters,"I never thought I'd give up on an Amy Tan novel, but I bailed midway through this one. It's sad that a novelist of Tan's enjoyable gifts has served up this hash of pedantic travelog, heavy-handed adolescent humor, and fly-on-the-wall documentary revolving around people who are relentlessly uninteresting, self-involved, and virtually indistinguishable from each other. No wonder the narrator died rather than tour Asia with these nattering bores. On the up side, the dog lives."
3,Saving Fish From Drowning,"This book is not one of my favorites. It was my first Amy Tan read and I had to make myself finish the story. Some of the incidents were interesting, but for a group of experienced travelers I felt she didn't give the characters ingenuity to outsmart the natives. There were some life changing moments for all, which was very interesting."
3,"Disappointing, but not terrible.","If this book were written by someone other than Amy Tan, it would not have drawn so many negative reader reviews. It was an imaginative and entertaining story, but the ending was rather a disappointment. The book had so many characters and layers of complexity - all woven together rather masterfully. I was expecting a spectacular ending, but instead the story just kind of fizzled out. I've kept my other Amy Tan books, but this one I listed on paperbackswap.com Nobody wants it so far. Need I say more?"
4,"Not her best, but I still recomend it","It's been a while since I read on of Ms Tan's books and I had forgotten what an excellent word smith she is!This may not be her best, but it is still a very readable and enjoyable tale. And it helps shed some light on the oft forgotten KaRen people. Well worth reading.Danny"
1,"Ahh, Amy...","I had to finish this for my book club, but it was laborious. I kept thinking that this was Amy Tan's ""A Painted House"" (Grisham) -- the novel that wouldn't have been published by any other author.... Where were the descriptions, the people we care about, the plot? I felt as though I were trapped on that boring busride for 200 pages, and then forced to watch CNN for the next 100, and the final 100 was her summary of each character's life. What was the purpose??"
1,Muddy Waters,I just finished Saving Fish from Drowning.. it read like it was written by a ghost writer or something.. missing that storytelling prose of Tan's previous books. It was a heavy handed civics lesson with undeveloped characters and a muddy plot. This is so unlike Amy Tan's previous books that it was very hard to find any of her essence on the pages. It was quite a disappointment.
1,Don't bother,"I've read every word (and loved them all) that Amy Tan has written - up to ""Saving Fish"". I tried and tried, but just couldn't come to care about any of the myriad of characters that were introduced in just the first 2 cassettes (when I gave up). Further, the unabridged book on tape is read by the author, who should leave the task to a more talented actress.Hopefully, she will work with a different editor on her next effort. My advice is: wait."
3,Not her best,"I have enjoyed all her other books but Amy Tan is off her stride in this one. From the narration by a dead person to the ill placed and clunky humor, to the endless and boring side stories taking place, I found this book to be a real disappointment. I pushed myself to read it and wanted to like it but just couldn't no matter how hard I tried."
1,Awful,"This is my first novel by this author. It was awful. I don't like to abandon a book once I've picked it up, but I bailed on this one. The story did not engage and I could care less about the characters and their mishaps."
1,Very Dissapointing...,"After reading some Amy Tan books in the past, I assumed this would also be a good one... Wrong.She crafts beautiful imagery and sentences but for some reason, it just doesn't draw you in the way a good book needs to. So much so that I can't even finish the book, and trust me, I tried. Nothing in the story motivates you to learn more and keep reading..."
1,Save me from drowning,I tried the audio version of this book and found it awful and unable to finish it. The reader's voice sounded like she was moving away and near the microphone so much that I actually visualized her rocking in her seat as she read. I thought in the beginning the story was going to be good about a tourist group that vanishes but you have about a million pages to ramble through of a woman telling her life story that is as about as boring and stale as old bread. Forget this one. I am running with mine to the used book store to dump it.
1,Ugh!,"I really hate to say this, because Amy Tan is one of my favorite writers, but I simply cannot finish this book (and I even managed to slog all the way through the horrid PILLARS OF THE EARTH). I'm tired of reading about everyone's ""toilet difficulties,"" I don't care about ANY of the characters (except the dog, so I'm glad to hear that he lives), and I cannot imagine what editor told the author that this book was a good idea.If you want to read great novels by an exceptional writer, read ANY of Tan's other novels. I am praying that she goes back to telling her wonderful stories from her Chinese heritage in her next book."
2,What happened?,"What happened? Amy Tan's normally highly engaging and emotionally empathetic style is completely missing...much to this book's downfall. Instead, Saving Fish from Drowning is hard to read and hard to follow. I thought if I kept reading I'd eventually find the rhythm, but it just wasn't there. I tried to like it because of the equity Amy Tan has earned from her previous excellent work, but this book just doesn't measure up. Too many characters, too many rambling sidebars...try re-reading Kitchen God's Wife if you need an Amy Tan fix, because you won't get it here."
3,"Ok, but not great.n","This was my least favorite Amy Tan book. I grabbed it off the shelves at the library and couldn't wait to get home to read it. I was a bit disappointed. The characters were a bit too stereotyped and lacked the depth of most of Tan's character. I didn't love"" any character in this book, and even found it a bit depressing. It took me over two months to read it, when I usually devour her books in a matter of days."
1,Save this book from drowning!,"I have read and adored Amy Tan's previous works and was left feeling very unsatisfied by this far fetched tale. Tan attempts to lure the reader into believeimng that the book is based on factual events, but actualy I read in an interview that she fabricated the whole thing.I found the charachters and the book both lacked depth and kept waiting for something ""big"" to happen. The whole thing was very anticlimactic and a disappointment. Hopefully her next novel will be more in synch with her previous works, or Tan may just lose a fan."
4,Something different from Amy Tan....,"This is different from Amy Tan's usual tales, but just as enjoyable! It's a very good story, told from an unusual point of view...which allowed for a omniscient presence and more insight into each character. I was slightly put off by the beginning, not being one for the paranormal, but I'm glad I stuck with it because it's a great story of the ""ugly Americans"" in Burma. I looked forward to reading it each night."
3,"Not My Favorite Tan Novel, But Good","This is a good story told in an interesting and original way. Bibi Chen of San Francisco is a prosperous and well-known woman in her community. She has arranged a trip to China and Burma for eleven of her friends, but she dies before the group is to leave. Her ghost, however, lingers and follows this ill-fated group of people on their travels. Thus, the reader is privy to all the intimate details of these people's lives as they try to cope with the perils of their trip. The first half of this book was very good. Filled with nuggets of Asian wisdom and spirituality. I liked the character Bibi and her take on people and worldly issues. The second half of the book tended to drag a bit and I found that the more I knew of the travelers, the less I liked them. Still, this book is worth reading if only for the knowledge it imparts on travel in Asia and Amy Tan's gift for story telling."
3,Saving me from drowning in this book,"I only rated this book 3 stars b/c I've only read a few chapters. I was so excited and couldn't wait to buy Amy Tan's new book. However since its release, I have not been able to finish reading it or finish a chapter in one sitting. Its not as captivating as her other books. I love all her books but this one is so boring I lose interest before I can fininsh a chapter. I have to keep re-reading the previous chapters b/c I keep putting it down and forgetting about it. I even tried listening to the book on audio CD book and it's still unappealing to me. I'm still debating wheather I should continue or give up. I hate to not read one Amy's book or give it a try since she is one of my favorite author."
1,Bummer.,"I was so excited to read this book. But when I put the first CD in my car's CD player, I was sure the player was broken. Tan's voice went in and out, blew up and down in volume, and faded away entirely at the ends of her sentences. In addition, the tracks are set in intervals that aren't over a minute--a sure sign that the audio director had trouble with Tan's reading. If I were him or her, I would have scrapped the project and found someone who could do the work justice. I would love to read my own books for audio one day, but not if it is going to be as embarrassing and ineffective as this result. I'll read the book in print, but I'm returning the audio to the library tomorrow."
2,This is not the usual Amy Tan book,"I always like Amy Tan books. They are usually a good escape. Light reading, but the charactors always pull you into the book. I honestly have not finished the book. I just could not get through the last few chapters, and I almost always finish books."
2,Not as good as Amy Tan's other books,"This was a good book, but not as good as Amy Tan's other books. It took me awhile to get into it. It was kind of strange-it you weren't nice to the gnats you would get a curse. The book was all about this curse. A better choice is The Joy Luck Club, The Bonesetter's Daughter or the Kitchen God's wife."
4,Don't read this book if you think that authors are not allowed to distance themselves from their favorite and successful themes,"Don't read it either if you think that an author is supposed to follow the rules dictated by creative writing courses (Is there somewhere in the world a real writer who ever took such a class ?). And of course, don't even try to read if you can't follow a plot with more than two characters. But if you are able to think out of the box, loved Amy Tan's previous books and if you are not afraid of reading something different peppered with Tan's magics, read 'Saving fish from drowning'."
3,Mmmmhhh,"When Bibi Chen mysteriously dies it's not over for her. Her soul will accompany her friends to Burma, the journey she planned to have with them. She's the one who tells us the story. She's the witness of all her friends' adventures. What it started as a holiday turns abruptly into an unaware kidnapping by a tribe, who recognise their saviour among these funny American tourists. We will learn things about Burma and its struggle for independence as well as the daily fight of its tribes for survival in a both funny and moving way. In the end we will discover so much about humanity and friendship. Of course she'll unveil the mystery about her death too.After ""The hundred secret senses"" (I read it in Italian and I fell in love with it: [...]... another lovely book by this author."
4,Good quick read,"Great book. It is very different from her other books. I found it to be very fanciful, not sure if it is true to its setting or not, but at any rate a good, quick, engaging,read."
3,Chinese culture is fascinating,"Bibi Chen has died. What was her affect on the people around her? The culture of China is fascinating, sometimes revolting, sometimes charming.The Burmese market people said they were ""saving fish from drowning"" when they offered up their wares. What is it about them that they refuse to say they are killing the fish in order to provide food for the people?Hard to forget images: The sacrifices offered to ""ghosts"" along the way, the temples and the interesting tribe people. The concept of ""in-between"" so very important. The little baby with the cleft palate who couldn't be adopted by the single mother, or her older parents."
4,Imaginative and important,"This is a good example of fiction telling the truth more honestly and clearly than non-fiction. Living in Thailand and keeping abreast of what's happening in Burma, I know that the Karens and other tribes are under constant attack by the junta and while the tribe is desperate and wants to believe in salvation from outside, the destruction of a whole village or tribe would be all in a day's work for the soldiers of the junta. Not sure that the device of Bibi Chen speaking from the other side works, but that's not as important as the story illustrating the horrors of genocide."
3,Not Her Best,"While I admit that this book was mildly entertaining at times, it just never went anywhere worthwile. The characters were extremely stereotypical, and the book just wasn't as amusing as Amy Tan tried to make it. It seems like the book could have been more serious or it could have been comical, but it was just too stiff, unrealistic, and farcical, despite the weighty subject matter, to really grab the reader's interest in one direction or another. Also, I didn't enjoy the ending, which added to the novel's farcical qualities. For old-time fans of Amy Tan, this is not her usual fare. Try it if you like, for it makes for an alright afternoon or two when there's nothing better to do, but don't expect writing up to her usual standards."
2,A disappointment from Amy.,I bought this book because I have read and LOVED all of Amy Tans other books. This one was NOT the page turner the others were. A few parts were alright...but I couldn't wait to finish and move on.
3,IS SEEING REALLY BELIEVING???,"Twelve American tourists join an art expedition that begins in the Himalayan foothills of China and proceeds North into the jungles of Burma. After the mysterious death of their tour leader the groups plans fall apart and hostility and discord breaks out among the pleasure seekers as they slowly discover the pitfalls that plague the road to Burma.And then, on Christmas morning, the eleven remaining travelers decide to take a sunrise boat cruise across a mist covered lake......and disappear.Ms. Tans novel poses the question, ""How can we differentiate between what is genuine and what is imaginary in everything we see.....and how do we really know what to believe"""
3,WOW ... I really wanted to love this book.,"This was quite a disappointment. It's not horrible, just not what you would expect from Amy Tan. As a huge Amy Tan fan, I really wanted to love this book. In Saving a Fish from Drowning, I felt no emotional attachment to any of the characters. The storyline was not unique, unlike her other books, it had references and characters borrowed from the media, such as a rip-off of the smoking Htoo twin brothers of Burma/Myanmar and shades of the Patricia Arquette film Beyond Rangoon."
3,Hated it,"I am an Amy Tan fanatic-I have read, reread and loved all of her books except this one. The plot is contrived, strange, and hard to follow. I really wanted to like it, but couldn't wait to finish it."
3,Interesting read,"It was not my favorite Amy Tan novel, but it was interesting to learn a little about the culture and politics of Myanmar while seeing how the characters interacted within the fictional situation. Narrating from the view of a the ghost of their planned tour guide made for an interesting POV."
2,Very disappointing!,"I love Amy Tan, but this was excruciating to get through. I kept reading in hopes it would get better and it just never did. I found it boring and disjointed. I didn't care about the characters at all! It's just not worth the effort."
2,Amy Tan and Sue Monk Kidd Strike Out,"Both of these authors have written wonderful books that I have read with delight. Both of them have recently published two huge disappointments (this book and ""The Mermaid Chair""). In Tan's book, there are too many characters, none of whom are very interesting; there is too much of a discourse on how awful the Myanmar situation is; the jungle kidnapping drags on and on--the whole book is boring. I have only about 30 pages left to read, but I can't seem to want to finish the book. Where have these two wonderful authors gone? Don't go there again!"
1,SAVING A FISH,"I TYPICALLY READ 2 BOOKS PER WEEK, TOM WOLFE, ETC. I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF FINSH THIS AND IT TOOK ME A MONTH."
1,Where did Amy Tan go?,"As an AVID Amy Tan fan, I eagerly awaited this book, and was highly dissapointed. I pre-ordered Saving Fish from Drowing from amazon and read it about six months ago. I can't remember anthing about it, so what does that tell you?"
2,Spoiler.......,"Ok, this is more of a comment than a review. I wish the 11 tourists that were 'kidnapped' would have died. I think that would've made for a better read. And all the parts about Harry and his fido-files were getting annoying."
3,Great if you have insomnia...,"I have enjoyed Amy Tan's books in the past immensely. This book was a disappointment. Though some of it is amusing, I found myself scanning pages just to get to the point of what was going to happen. I've been having trouble sleeping lately and this book worked great in helping me get to sleep quick."
3,I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO IT YET!!!!!!,"It arrived in a timely manner, but as yet I haven't had time to listen to it"
1,What a Waste of Time,"I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted so much time reading it. This over-hyped, boring melodrama doesn't live up to the author's reputation or skill. It is full of over-developed characters that I never developed any empathy for and, therefore, never cared what happened to them. The writing is terribly simplistic and there is no compelling story, or even a plot, until half way through the 474 pages. In fact, the first half of the book was a death-march through a China/Burma travelog. The second half was a sad attempt to use fiction to educate but it just felt obvious and preachy. In short, this highly disappointing effort by the author requires masochistic plodding by the reader to finish."
3,If this was about redemption . . . .,". . . .it failed. I tried and struggled to get through this book. Tan is a gifted author. Clearly what she was attempting here missed the mark. The plot is kind of interesting. Most of us are in denial over some part of our character. I don't maintain eye contact . . . nonsense! I drink too much . . . . WELL I CAN HANDLE IT! And of course for the self-centered, there is the battle between denial and right. This would be especially true of Amy Tan's characters, so full of themselves. Actually, so full of themselves they're disturbing. As a kid growing up in New York, we said of those who felt they were in the entitled class, ""they think who the heck they are.""And changing those people probably could be done swifter and in a more direct fashion. I just didn't know where Ms. Tan was going and my suspician is, she never got there. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury"
3,saving fish from drowning,"Amy Tan leads the reader to believe that this story is based upon real events, when,infact, the newspaper account of the tourists was also fictional. I was diappointed in this book. As a fan of Tan's, I felt this book didn't measure up. It was an arduous read, and I do not recommend it."
3,Harmless Pageturner,"I had to read this book for my Book Club and after reading the other reviews I was dreading it. However, perhaps because my expectations were quite low, I ended up reading it very quickly and really quite enjoyed it. That's not to say that I thought it was a great book. I liked the concept of the dead friend narrator and thought that worked really well. But the characters were pretty dull and I didn't really care what happened to them. Having said that, I did find myself turning each page in dread at the thought of something horrible happening. So on the whole a harmless pageturner. Hasn't turned me into an Amy Tan Fan or Hater. I must say, it's quite comfortable sitting here on this fence."
1,One star is too high... don't waste your time,"Unless you enjoy endless toilet room descriptions of various products of intestinal problems and scenes of tortured livestock and dying puppies (I'm NOT kidding) this is NOT the book for you. This is one of two books I have thrown in the trash in my lifetime. (I'd have thrown it in the sewer, but I couldn't find one fast enough.) I kept thinking that surely the latest description of the look and smell of bathroom deposits would be the last, but every few pages there was another! The last one I read was followed by a description of a dying puppy. All this occured within the first 50 pages! What a waste of paper! I will never pick up another book by this author and I may think twice about the publisher. Whatever redeeming qualities might be here were covered up completely by the constant fixation on toilet issues."
5,Saving Fish...,Seller sent the book promptly and I would buy from them again. It was required reading for my daughter who is enjoying it. Thanks
3,The audio version,"I have never read an Amy Tan novel, so I had no idea what to expect from this one -- and I haven't finished listening to it.My first comment is that this is not a novel that benefits from being read by the author. A professional reader would have done a far better job. As it is, many words are indistinct, and the flow, the tone, is too even.Therefore, I found this very hard to get in to. The opening pages have little action -- it's all a dreamlike reverie -- not calculated to keep you alert if you are listening in the car hoping to be diverted and stay awake. I have come to rather enjoy the tale, though, and I may finish it. But by tape # 3, it is not exactly compelling. It's probably much more suited for a paper and print experience."
5,Excellent,"I have never read an Amy Tan book I didn't like, and Saving Fish from Drowning is no different. In this novel, I was hooked from the beginning by the voice of the ghost telling the story. What an innovative way to tell such a story and so convincing. It works because she manages to expertly weave Chinese spirituality with an unusual, yet engaging story. So, of course a ghost would be telling the story. Highly Recommended."
2,Bloodless rehash,"A tepid rehash of a subject that has been better covered elsewhere. I found this to to be written in such a way as to be worthy of perhaps a novella of about 125 pages. Instead it is close to five hundred pages of rather routine prose, with a dose of authorial self-satisfied cleverness, unconvincing and nearly indistinguishable characters about whom it was difficult to care. Even the ""surprise"" ending was unconvincing and abrupt. I didn't care what happened to whom. Devoid of subtlety. I suppose it has some cautionary interest for the careless traveler, but a wan 470 page novel is not the best place to learn the lesson."
4,who is valerie ryan,"i just want to ask you who is Valerie Ryan that reviewed Amy Tan's book for Amazon.com. Is she a customer? or does she work for Amazon. If she works for Amazon let me just say this to her...if you don't get it don't review it. Ms. Ryan points out in her review of ""Saving fish from drowning"" that ""the fish do not survive"" well duh!"
2,Kept hoping it get better but it did not...,"This book was not the typical Amy Tan novel I have grown to love. The characters in this book were flat and superifically developed. The plot was predictable and boring. I truly felt that the book had potential but failed in too many ways. I hope that Amy Tan's next book will return us to what she writes on the best: Chinese culture, mores, and traditions."
1,Stilted and laborious,"Oh, Ms. Tan, what happened? I'm such a fan, have read everything you've published. Usually, I'm delighted in your turn of phrase and every word you choose. This was such a disappointment. The whole book sounded so forced. I'm sure it's something you ""had to do"" for ""growth"" but it lacks the emotional depth so central to your work."
3,Magic in the everyday,"Saving Fish from Drowning was an entertaining read. Not quite as enthralling as Tan's earlier books, but in her typical style she interweaves the magical with the everyday creating an other worldly environment where the story takes place."
2,"Audiobook is poorly done, book itself needs heavy editing","First off, I am an Amy Tan fan. But Ms. Tan's gifts do not including reading her own books. Her voice drops off, trails away, so listening to this always required one finger on the volume control. Also, as a native San Franciscan, I think her variety of ""chinese accent"" voices are child-like and culturally offensive. In one section of the book she kept repeating the word ""geniTAHlia"" (sounding like a British gynecologist)and she seems very concerned with the bathroom habits of her characters. At that point I was close to quitting the endeavor of listening. But I am a Tan Fan, so I continued with patience but no pleasure and at last bought the paperback so I could read it through myself. Ouch! A good editor could have chopped out 100-150 pages for a much more readable and cogent end product. Ultimately a story of uninteresting characters plodding through a poorly chosen geographical literary location."
5,I Loved this Book,"It's funny how a lot of the reviewers on here loved Tan's other books, but not this one. It was the opposite for me. I find Tan's other books boring and bland. However, I couldn't put this book down! Definetly one of the better books I've read in the past few years."
5,Never thought I would like unlikable characters this much,"The characters were shallow and incapable of seeing the world around them. Tan uses this to show the reader exactly what they are missing. For a group of characters that were extremely unlikable, the book itself was a fun read."
3,Dissapointing,"As a long time, hard core Amy Tan fan, I was eagerly awaiting the release of her latest novel. Sad to say it was all I could do to finish it. Ms. Tan missed the boat on this one."
2,"Not her finest work, not by a long shot","I am a fan of Amy Tan's, and would really encourage readers to check out her other work. This one just didn't do it for me. It started out seeming like it would be a really fun story, and about midway through I found myself totally confused as to where she was going with this. About 100 pages from the end, I cared less to less to know, and by the last 50 pages felt like it was torture to finish. I couldn't wait for it to end, and no longer cared how what happened, as long as I got to close the book for good. (You know now that I think about it, I skimmed the last 25 pages, it was that bad) Two stars for effort & reputation, not for entertainment."
2,Finally finished!,"Based on other reviews I would not have chosen this book. But, I have enjoyed other Amy Tan books and a respected friend recommended this one. She told me up front that it's nothing like her other books but still an excellent book. So, I went into it with my eyes open, not expecting typical Amy Tan. Even with that preparation, it was still hard to finish. I enjoyed the first 50 pages or so, but really bogged down after that. I was thrilled when I finally finished it and could begin a new book. This is one book my friend and I will have to agree to disagree about."
5,Amy Tan Rules,"I haven't yet read all of Amy Tan's books (I am now going to go back and do this!) but I loved this one. I learned so much about a country (Myanmar) that before this book I couldn't have placed on a map. I am a college educated person that reads constantly but I had my atlas and dictionary out for this one. I couldn't believe how many words were used that I had to look up, and for me that is a good thing because I really feel better for having read this one!"
4,When Author's Try Something New...,"Anytime an author or moviemaker tries something new there ends up being backlash. I think that is what is happening here. I greatly enjoyed this new novel. It departs from Amy Tan's traditional style and themes but introduces us to a whole new kind of Amy Tan novel. I found it far lighter and funnier than her other novels, which I also enjoy. I found the characterizations of the ugly americans to be dead on, and the circumstance in which they find themselves only futhers Amy Tan's dark humor. Ignore the negative reviews and give it a chance."
1,Disappointed,I love Amy Tan. The Bonesetters Daughter is one of my all time favorite books. And of course the Joy Luck Club is a classic. I guess she was trying something different here but it didn't work for me as I was looking for her creative insight into relationships. Maybe it comes later in the book. But after drudging though almost 100 pages-I quit. Couldn't finish as I was still totally bored and not connecting to the characters at all.
2,this took FOREVER!!! Very disappointing.,"We read this for our book club selection. It had been recommended by someone who listened to it as a book on tape -with Amy Tan reading. That must have been it's saving grace. It literally took me 3 months to finish (I kept thinking this HAS to get better - but it never did, and everything started to look better than continuing this book). Actually most people never showed up at book club to even discuss the book - they disliked it so much. It was not the worst book I have ever read - there is evidence that she is not a bad writer per se. It's just that this book should have been half it's length. Too much detail about things that never really matter - and hard to follow when it puts you to sleep night after night. And the perspective from the spirit world did not work as I believe she intended. At times it told you too much before it unfolded, at other times I wish she would just get to the point and get on with whatever the story was supposed to be."
2,I couldn't finish this one,"Perhaps it's unfair of me to write a review since I chose not to finish the book, but the fact that I didn't finish it must say something. As many of the other reviewers, I am a big Amy Tan fan. I love her stories of intergenerational and intercultural tensions and this is what we have come to expect from this author. I have no problem with authors writing in a new genre, but this book contains wooden characters, uninteresting dialogue and a plot that plods. Read it if you must, but be forewarned that it is NOT a typical Amy Tan book."
1,Amy Tan is not a Reader,"She does write well, and I very much enjoyed previous works. [[ASIN:034546401X Saving Fish from Drowning: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)] This review pertains to the audio version of Saving Fish from Drowning. As a long-time listener to audio books, I have a lot with which to compare this performance. Seldom have I had to quit listening because of the low quality of the presentation. This is a case in which I simply could not continue because of the distracting nature of her poor diction, monotonous reading style, and inability to bring the written page alive. Writing is a different art from reading aloud. It was a serious mistake for her to attempt a task for which she is ill prepared and untrained."
4,An Unusual Tan Novel,"I was expecting the usual Amy Tan, and I LOVE all her work, but this one is different. Very different. And the story isn't the usual heart-wrenching story about a girl in China/US. This one is just plain fun. Kinda weird in spots but fun. Some death, a spirit (it's ok, no one knows she's around) love and even a puppy. I won't give anything away, but if you love Tan I suggest you try this story."
4,Glad I didn't read the negative reviews before I read the book,"I found this book highly engaging and readable, the characters clearly defined. There was a great deal of humor, much of it black, and a great deal of heart. This book was a page turner with a message. Each character is a recognizable tourist type, and most of them would be horrified if they were saddled with the ""Ugly American"" label. But then, they really aren't ""ugly"" at all, but well meaning if clueless. On the other hand, the natives are not all innocents, and there is a lot of humor in the misdirections and misunderstandings that ensue. As I say in my title, I am glad I didn't read all these negative reviews first because I probably wouldn't have picked the book up at all and would have missed a nice reading experience."
2,I miss the real Amy Tan!,"Amy Tan has always been one of my favorite authors, but I was quite disappointed in this book. She was obviously trying to branch out and try something new, and I applaud her efforts to be fresh and different, but this book just comes off as a big joke on the reader. I was intrigued by the premise, and enjoyed the fist 100 pages or so, but had to force myself to finish it out of morbid curiosity. Tan is usually witty, but this novel is sarcastic and cynical. She can usually rip your heart out with genuine tragedy, but this novel is full of 'gotcha' moments that make you think you're going to feel something you ultimately don't. Bizarrely, it reminded me of a lesser Michael Crichton novel...sort of ""Congo"" meets ""Jurassic Plants"". Add a dollop of Anthony Bourdain's ""A Cook's Tour"" (aren't natives silly, yet oh so inspiring?) you have a weird, soggy mess of a novel. Sorry, Ms Tan. Please go back to what you do best."
1,What happened to Amy Tan?,"Amy Tan one, if not, my all time favorite author dropped the ball with this novel. I love all her novels and have read each of them over and over, especially ""The Bone Setters Daughter."" In ""Saving Fish From Drowning"" I had alarm bells going off in my head at chapter 1. If that happens with any other book I will set it down, but this was Amy Tan! I was sure if I kept on it I'd love it. Well, I was sadly mistaken. I skipped ahead just to see if I could pick up her style, or ""some good parts"" but I found nothing! Too many characters, none of them developed to the point that I'd care about them. The narration from the murdered Bibi Chen, was almost to the point of cattiness. Sorry Amy but I'd tell any fan to steer clear of this one!"
2,'Lovely Bones' & 'Desperate Housewives' take a cruise?,"It's a new low when I see a writer like Amy Tan come up with this turkey of an idea! (Publishers: Try to give us a big hit?) Okay--so we had the LOVELY BONES where a ghost tracks down her killer-- as she tells her story--then we have the ever-popular DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES TV series--somehow the two must merge (?)--and Amy ( I can imagine the powers that be saying this)--""you got yourself a hit ""! But this clearly is a stretched idea and it comes off this way: strained and contrived. I am so sorry to see this very good writer (I loved JOY LUCK and I also enjoyed BONESETTER'S DAUGHTER) But this? Amy! What are you doing? Oh my...I suggest passing on this one and try: NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, EMPIRE FALLS."
5,Quality Music with Style,"This CD has some phat beats and it will get you moving. It is bass heavy (in a good way) as it has a lot of thump to it. Good listening if you have a good sound system with a powerful subwoofer. The tracks are good one after another and you can listen to this CD straight through. If you try to dance to the whole CD straight through, you might not make it though (unless you're extremely physical fit). The heavy beats motivate you to move in big and strong movements and in about 3-4 songs, I'd say you are suffienciently worked out and satisfied. Then you can just take a seat and nod your head to it. Pretty interesting."
1,Like having a conversation under water,"We returned the phone after using it for only one day, due to the atrocious voice quality. Callers on the other end of the line could only be heard properly if the volume was turned all the way up, but at full volume you hear your own voice magnified. The range of the phone was also poor, on every channel. To top it off, our answering machine message sounded like we were speaking with our hands over our mouths while we recorded it. Not recommended."
3,Good over all,I had this phone for over a month now and so far so good. Probably is not the best phone you can buy but for the price is good. The sound is acceptable.
4,Advanced 1400 - Little less exciting than I thought,"I did extensive research on treadmills including funcationality and features before deciding on this model.It was rated pretty high for a mid range (price and function).I see only 3 drawbacks so far with this model so far:1. You're plugging along at 3.5mph in manual mode and for some reason the speed slows down but the machine is still registering at 3.5 mph. I expect this while in one of the programs as the machine is designed to due but not in manual mode.2. You cannot scroll to see your progress like the models at the gym; you just wait patiently until it comes around on the display.3. You cannot get an accurate heart rate while walking/running by grabbing the hand rails. You must step on the side bars to measure accurately while wasting a minute or so of your workout.Overall it's a good machine; comfortable, just big enough, and effective, but it's hard getting used to if you've grown accustomed to the models at the gym."
5,THE BEST!!!,the best treadmill if u have a problem with impact. i gave up running due to knee and back problems. the springs on the image 1400 allow for asofter landing when running and therefore i can now resume my cardio workouts without beating my knees and back to a pulp. definitely a 10!!!.
1,blower motor,this product was not as described or pictured It was a single blower not a double as pictured. I returned
4,Mini-Mini-Figs!,"I was surprised with how many nice little things this set came with. First there's the lego redesign of the speederbiker with new more curvey front and grooved back. One of the ewoks attaches to a hanglider which was a little confusing assembling, but displays very nicely on a clear stand with pivot. There is also an ewok catapult that should have wheels but does not. The catapult is probably the most disapointing part of the set; but there is 2 new ewok mini-mini-figs (shorter legs that are not poseable) and 2 storm troopers(one biker scout, one regular)! All in all, a pretty decent lego set and worth getting to add more storm troopers and the ewoks to your collection."
5,"Ewoks Attack from the sky, the ground, and..uh..the catapult","Ewok Attack is a great set that is, a quality extremely rare with Legos, worth more than its price. An Ewok hang glider, a speeder bike, and a catapult would be, I think, worth more than [the cost], not to say I'd like them to raise the price. There are four mini figures in this set and half of them are one-of-a-kind. (Wicket and Paploo the Ewoks) The hang glider is very cool. I think it's the first and last lego set to come with fishing poles. Wicket is the pilot. The speeder bike is different and a bit more beefy, but other than that it isn't a big surprise. The catapult is cool because it has those authentic propeller things and really fires. I have nothing bad to say about this set, aside from the fact that they could have made Wicket's hood red like in the movie. The storm trooper is cool and kind of uncommon and has a cool helmet. To sum this set up I have just four words: BUY THIS SET NOW!!!"
5,Very Cool Set!,"Ewok Attack is a fantastic Star Wars Lego set. This set would be an excellent buy if you have the AT-ST and some of the other Imperial sets. Ewok Attack comes with four detailed minifigs: two Ewoks, one Stormtrooper, and one Biker Scout. One Ewok flies a hang-glider, which is terrific but not very durable. The other mans a rock-shooter, and the Biker Scout rides his speeder bike, which has perfect detail. If you want to build an army of Ewoks or Imperial troops, buy more of these sets. Well worth the dough, I would recommend this set to all Star Wars/Lego fans.Tom, BIG Star Wars Fan"
2,For the purist,"This book was by far not my favorite work on one of everyone's favorite band. It gave you some interesting points of view on the band, its members and some of the struggles they endured. But the book would probably be more appropriately titled, 2 chapters on GNR the band and the rest on why Axl Rose is a whack job. If you were ever brave or curious enough to explore the inner workings of the mind of one of rocks most notorious front man, then maybe this is for you. Too much Axl, not enough everyone else. If your more a veteran on GNR lit. go ahead. if this is your first GNR book, I would strongly suggest SLASH or Watch You Bleed, first."
2,Good thing it was cheap,"I am a huge fan of Guns n Roses and Velvet Revolver and thought this would make a great read. But right at the beginning I could tell that the author has no writing skills whatsoever. He really needed to fire his editor because there were quite a few mispellings and grammatical errors, but that wasn't the biggest flaw with the book. Most of the information is taken from magazine interviews and the rest seems to be complete hearsay. It would have been nice for the author to actually talk to the bandmembers in length before devoting a whole book to them. I feel that it was unfair, mostly to Slash, Izzy, Steve and Duff.He made Axl out to be some god, which he is far from being. It was the other guys who had the drug problem, not Axl. YEAH RIGHT!Either way, the book is poorly written so try to buy it used or borrow someone else's if you really want to read it."
2,It was midly interesting,It was okay but I definately don't reccomend anyone to buy it. Its totally inaccurate (At some parts) and it seems to want to focus on Axl a lot of the time more than the band. If you want to read about Guns I'd suggest looking elsewhere.
3,"Interesting, but it miss something!","Interesting, because I am a big GN'R fan. But it could have been a lot better. Not enough details about the tales of debauchery and the lifestyles of each original members. Where is Steven Adler? What about Izzy Stardlin? What about their idylls with porn stars, super models, and groupies? I prefers a type of book like the dirt of Motley Crue, which countains all the real stuff.But for those who don't know, the book reveals an interesting side of Axl Rose psychology. In three words: a psychotic woof.I still wait for Chinese Democracy, Axl!"
3,Okay,"This book was okay. It didn't really have much new info if you're a fan of GNR and really follow their story. It was an okay read though. The editor should be fired though; lots of mistakes and missing words, at least it seemed to me. I found myself having to re-read different sentences and paragraphs and fill in the missing word. Once I did that it was ""oh yeah. That's what he meant.""Other than needing a good proofreader, it was pretty cool. AXL is still the man!"
5,It was on a spring evening.,"In the previous spring, I went on a trip to New York with my lifelong friend. We met for the first time in 15 years. Her mother, who often made nice coffe for me, has gone to Christ these two monthes. I loved her. Her partner, a Karajan admirer in his youth, advised us to go to N.Y. for healing her sorrow and listening to the concert. We agreed. A date of the concert, after taking a walk on Central Park early in the spring, we were sleeping soundly up until evening. Oh! The darkest hour comes before the dawn. All the flower shops were closed. At the Deli, we bought red roses for the conductor, white tulips for the pianist. For white flowers,I wanted, were the only tulips. And we could give them two bouquet. She said, ""What a wonderful night it is! I shook hands with him."" After we left New York, I knew that the original meaning of tulip is turban. END"
4,Fine Recent Recording of Beethoven's 2nd/5th Piano Concerti,"Kissin gives a vibrant, youthful interpretation of Beethoven's first and last piano concerti in this excellent Sony recording. While he does not yet play with the commanding presence of Ashkenazy, Brendel, Perahia or Schiff, his technical skills on the keyboard come close. His warm performance of the 5th Piano Concerto isn't as dramatic a performance as any I have heard from Kovacevich or Perahia, but it is a credible version. Levine and the Philharmonia are sympathetic accompanists. If one is a fan of Kissin's playing then this is worth owning."
1,Do not spend your money,"Sometimes Mozart, sometimes Wagner, but never Beethoven. Levine conduct too fast. Do not spend your money, please. Celibidache, We miss You..."
5,No silicone!,"This furniture conditioner works great, without the silicone they put in most furniture polishes. Silicone will seep into wood and prevent it from taking stain and finishes. This is important if you ever decide to refinish a piece of furniture."
3,As good as any ordinary furniture polish...bad can!,"I have an older baby grand piano with the typical wood veneer of it's time period. I honestly don't see any difference using Steinway Furniture Care Cleanse and Condition and any ordinary furniture polish. Other than the brand name which I suppose makes you feel that this is the best to use for pianos, the results are the same. And for the price I paid, just under $9 plus $5 shipping, I could have bought several cans of regular furniture polish. The worst part of my purchase however was that the aerosol can leaked the product from the nozzle either while spraying or just tipping the can over. I suppose it could have just been a damaged can that may have occured during shipping which I should have returned. But either way, the product itself is not worth getting again especially at that price."
1,imitating business as usual,"It never came. I didn't get the book. It's not there. Absentio. Really Magic. Disappeared. Puppets are us. Well maybe You. This will teach you to stick me with a written review, although I didn't ask for such a privilege. Such a privilege-waiting for dial up connection, reading a book I purchased elsewhere, waiting to tell you there's no book, forgetting even that I ordered it, until I came across the invoice or packing slip,waiting for you to get firm and yet tolerant of some whiner asking for her money back when the deadline is like really past, and I'm waiting and what finally appears but this ridiculous befriending of moi asking for a written review when all I wanted was to check some boxes indicating The Magic never materialized. See ya."
5,Great pocket knife,"This is a great, small pocket knife. I usually always have the standard size folding pocket knife, about 4 inches closed. I received this knife as a gift and at first I thought I wouldn't like it because it is about half the size I'm used to. I was wrong. This knife is awesome. I keep it in my front pocket (using the clip) and it is much handier, and I feel less likely to lose it or have someone grab it. I do not miss the larger knife at all! Super sharp, excellent quality knife."
3,Slighty disappointed,"I would have given this 5 stars however the plastic ladle and plastic hooks for the cups are very cheap. Have no clue why they wouldn't use a glass ladle. Otherwise, the design is very pretty, nicer than the usual looking crystal-cut style and the cups are very sturdy."
5,This book shows that you can put the past behind and move on,"Throughout the book, the author challenges you to look at yourself for the answers to lifes battles. We all have mountains to climb. Sometimes we forget that it takes knowledge of the tools needed to make the climb to the top. This book shows you that you were born with those tools and how to recognize them and use them.Mostly, the author points out not to expect to be loved without first loving. Give, and it will be given unto you. Great ideas throughout the book. I only wish it was on audio."
4,Dr. Robert Anthony is one of the best,"I've read several of Dr. Anthony's books and this one is a bit different from the rest. He relies on the parable or story telling rather just just giving his great wisdom like many of his other books. It works but I just don't think this is one of his best works. I would recommend reading any of his other books first before you get to this one. If parables help you learn, you will love this. I simply enjoy Dr. Anthony's confidence and his candid style and you hope you enjoy these books."
1,USELESS,"With over 15 years of experience and up to date on all of the new product lines as well as the upper level machines, I must say that this book isn't worth the paper it is printed on. Most if not all of the information contained is readily available from the manufacturer of the appliance. If you have a more serious problem with your machine then you do in fact need a technician to inspect it and give you the options to repair it CORRECTLY or to purchase a new machine. Put your dollar to use and hire a real professional, with real, in the field experience."

3,Good show...bad cuts,"I recently purchased this set and found that just like the Starz / Anchor Bay release, the episodes are badly cut. I don't know what it is about production companies in the United States. It is nearly impossible to get complete and uncut episodes of any TV show. ""Columbo"" was badly cut up. I learned from Universal that they released only the syndication cuts of the show, not the ""complete & uncut"" version. ""Nero Wolfe"" episodes are missing as much as 20 minutes in some episodes and a minimum of 5 minutes. So far, out of six TV series I have purchased on DVD that were released by studios in the United States, all of them contain cut episodes and none are ""complete"". ""The Commish"" is just another example of greed in the American studios as they clutch and grab for more and more of the almighty consumer dollar."
4,wow,"Tuve que comprar este disco en España porque no era disponible en EEUU. Es musica muy buena. Este grupo tiene otro disco se llama simplemente Cafe Quijano, y es muy bueno tambien. No es para los viejos, sin embargo."
4,"It's not your Mother's Upstairs, Downstairs","Once you stop looking for Hudson and Mrs. Bridges this series has much to offer. The stories are interesting, the acting good, and the rework of the theme song enjoyable.I wish there were more episodes being made."
4,GONE TO SOON!,Despite a slow start I really enjoyed this show. It was beautiful to watch. The characters had developed and became real just as the show was ending.
2,Bought for someone else.,This snobby boring English gatbage is Definitely not my thing. Purchased it for someone else. I would NEVER watch this.
4,My required headline for this review :),"This series is not as good as the original, and I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Downton Abbey, but with the exception of one or two of the story lines I really liked it."
5,CAUTION: These reviews are for the first Upstairs Downstairs series,"This is very confusing because someone at Amazon has confused this new second season of the NEW Upstairs Downstairs series with the original five-season series from the 1970s. I did not look at all the reviews here, but the ones I read described the 1970s series. Also, note that the actors listed next to the series name (Gordon Jackson, Christopher Beeney, etc.) were actors in the 1970s series. AMAZON, PLEASE CHANGE THIS!"
5,BBC Series,A great series. A British household in early 1900's the staffing of a new household and the interaction with the aristocracy.
5,Better then the old series,This was really well done about prewar and the WW2. To the quality of Downton Abby and Foyle's War. I hope they decide to do more.
3,POOR FOLLOW UP,poor follow up of orIginal slow and tedious waste of my time all the men looked alike very hard to get into
2,Disapointed,I wish you would leave out the lesbian details. Ruined it for me. Complete nudity and kissing etc. leave no room for imagination. I'll be more careful before continuing this series. Sorry but very disappointed that you think you needed this to sell the movie.
4,Wish it had continued,"When I first heard about this show, it was in the context of comparing it to Downton Abbey, which I love. I never saw the original Upstairs Downstairs, and I didn't want to watch something that was too similar to Downton because I thought I'd be distracted comparing the two shows. That was not the case. The shows are pretty different, and I really enjoyed this one. I wish it had been continued for a third season."
5,Whats not to love?,"It's Upstairs Downstairs. It's----I hate this word----iconic!! Acting is great, costumes are amazing, sets are perfect, the whole thing is mahvelous Dahling!"
2,Not at all like the 70's seasons,"I thoroughly enjoyed the 70's seasons on my Kindle Fire HD while waiting for Downton Abbey to come back on. But these two seasons that they tried to restart in 2010 (?) are indicative of what's happened to a lot of TV. It's all about who's sleeping with who, etc., like a giant soap opera. The first set was actually about the servants downstairs and the masters upstairs. This seemed to stay pretty much upstairs and was therefore not well-rounded. It seemed apt though, as they don't really seem to like the servants having sex. LOL"
4,Loved it,Was sorry to see it ended. Great series. Almost as good as Downton Abbey. Not sure why PBS didn't continue it.
1,Bad music and an incompetent libretto.,"Give the composer credit. What better way to guarantee good reviews than to hire a music critic as a librettist. Do you think any critic will rake a colleague over the coals?Easily the worst piece of music to hit major opera stages in the past ten years. The music has no substance and substitutes complexity for profundity. The libretto is beneath contempt, absolutely incomprehensible and worthless.Be sure to mark this one down as a must no buy."
1,Um.... something's wrong here!,"Why is it, that I feel like I'm watching Cinemax within the first 2 minutes of this movie?This movie has furry characters with cleavage that puts Pamela Anderson to shame.I feel violated. I won't let my kid watch this!If you're into really naughty furry animal type videos.... this might be the one for you..... in which case, you're sick."
2,Not the video I expected...........,"Way too many interviews with the same fans over, and over, and over again. I thought there would be game highlights, revisits of past victories, key plays, etc. - Unfortunately, not the case."
5,Perfect Buy,"Smooth and seamless transaction brought me a book in truly excellent shape, for a very good price. All things in life should work so perfectly!"
4,Lobot at last!!,"It's good to see Lando's balding little friend at last immortalized as a LEGO minifig. I suppose next we need to demand Lando himself...But I digress. The set is simple but fun, which ultimately is the point, isn't it? Neat little details, and I love how the hatch opens two ways- really expands the playability. The center support wobbles a bit, but is easily reinforced with spare pieces. Also, don't let the box-front pic throw you off: the set does not contain the coveted dark red brick like the blockade runner... the bricks here are in fact brown.All in all a good buy with plenty of good pieces. Buy one, or start up a Cloud City defense squad. Altogether neato."
4,I did the cover and illustrations so I'm a little biased but...,"I'm the illustrator for the book and when they authors first approached me I though ""A whole book? Is it really that bad out there?"" The short answer is yes. The personal stories of fraud, revenge, miscommunications and outright weirdness are a good primer for education yourself about the possible pitfalls of online transactions. The book's style is tongue in cheek and it's a fun breezy read. From a purely morbid point, reading the stories is like watching a train wreck in slow motion...without the death and destruction part.I'm a huge fan of ""people history"" and ""memoir"" type books so this naturally appeals to me. If you are looking for a technical expose on online fraud from an engineering point of view, this is NOT the right book. However if you like to read what people like yourself are experiencing from a layperson's point of view, you will probably find it a worthwhile purchase."
5,Incredibly truthful book,"Ebay is a great place but it was much better in its infancy when there were less scammers. As its grown so has its problems. Scammers have infiltrated its system and are now impossible to root out mostly because Ebay denies it has a problem, Just like your common ""JUNKIE"" the more you deny the bigger the problem grows.This book is a must read because the stories are straight from the people who have been scammed. Without such a book stories like these could never be heard because the Ebay giant silences all who speak out. ...."
4,Charming Polish story,We read this book as part of our homeschooling curriculum while we were learning about Europe. Charming story about a young girl who wants to break the family tradition and buy her mother a store bought gift rather than make a homemade one. My 11 year old daughter read this aloud during our family reading time and the entire family enjoyed it.
3,Geography's Off,"I liked the story, but I was bothered by the sporadic development of the subplot--solving the mystery of Rain's presence in the desert. But what bothered me most was Joe's non-existent Navajo reservation in Nevada. The Indian reservations in that state are mostly of the Piute and Shoshone people. The Navajo reservation is 400+ miles east in Arizona, with Utah and the Grand Canyon in between. Sorry,but as a traveler of Nevada's beautiful, desolate roads,I got distracted by these geographic inaccuracies."
5,A Small Correction,"I have not read this book, though I know it belongs to a series whose productions are excellent and represent the latest scholarship. Having perused the list of scholars who are contributors, I expect the same will be true of this volume.I only wish to comment on the advertising blurb. I believe that it was Hume's aunt (or great-aunt) who is credited with this quote and what she actually said was that little Davie was ""uncommon wake-minded"" (meaning unusually bright and curious) not ""weak-minded"". It is also quite clear that she did not approve of this trait in the young Hume. Many others will no doubt agree with her about this, but certainly no one will think that he was in any way weak-minded."
5,Wonderful,"These are large earings. The shell is beautiful and the color is great. Just know that they are very large. I usually dont wear such big earings, but these would be perfect for an evening out."
1,NOT PLUM!!!!,"Not sure what happened to true Plum hair dye, but they are all red these days.If you want PLUM, do not buy this product!"
5,Exploiting 9/11,"This is an excellent collection of interviews on the subject of the neoconservative counterrevolution in Washington, and the strategies surrounding 9/11 and the war in Iraq. Behind the public statements of the administration lie the deeper motives of the operation: control of dwindling resources, intimidation with a display of military strength, and a neoconservative philosophy promoting an explicit imperialism. Exploiting the anxieties of the 9/11 catastrophe is the crux of the propaganda game. The text includes interviews with Tariq Ali, Chomsky, Benjamin Barber, Chalmers Johnson, and Shadia Drury who provides an interesting commentary on the hidden Straussianism of the neoconservative clique."
5,awesome handcream,"i have used this hand cream for years! it is just awesome and is worth every penny. it goes on silky and smooth without a greasy after-feeling..... and a little goes a long way! it keeps my fingers from cracking around the nails during cold weather, too, and i've tried many creams for that. actually, i even use it as my face cream under my make-up, because it is not greasy and it moisturizes so well! best product out there, hands down!"
5,price,WHY IS THE PRICE TO BUY THIS CD SO HIGH? I KNO ITS RARE TO FIND THIS CD BUT THE PRICE IS A LIL STEEP!
1,well ...,"OK, maybe Jesus never visited the Americas, but I'm pretty sure he visited Hawaii, astonishing the locals with his awesome surfing talent"
3,Really... Does It Matter?,"Maybe the book is of interest to some but I am tired of everyone's need to proove or disproove beliefs, espeically those who use anicdotal ""proofs"" in favor of their stand. If the religion works as a way of explaining and relating to God then who cares about the proofs... Really."
5,"A book of life, love, and the cooling autumn breeze","This book influenced my life growing up. It's about a boy who lives in the country and the adventures he has. If you enjoyed Tom Sawyer, you'll enjoy this book. There are some very sad parts, some action, but in the end everything works out for the most part. It's published by Zondervan, so it's high quality and doesn't have any bad parts. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a comfortable chair and a weekend coming up.This book belongs on every teenagers bookshelf. I loved it then and I'll read it again and again now! (I'm 27!) For the parent, this book is clean but exciting, in the best tradition of books."
2,Ain't we Hip?!!?,"This is the avant version of these songs, everything done with that Downtown fingers-across-the-blackboard screech. They even got Johanson doing it, which is no less than amazing. The sole exception is the Persuasions' ""O Heavenly Salvation"", but one song does not an album make.The mystery here is that there's a perfectly good compilation from the 80s, ""Lost in the Stars: the Music of Kurt Weill"", featuring many of the same songs--and, if I'm not mistaken some of the same performers. That's the one you want. Too bad it's OP."
3,Interesting,"This recording clearly has some historic value but I would have preferred more melodic renditions of some of the songs (September Song for example)Interesting but for me, sadly, a bit disappointing"
5,Kaplan Civil Service Exams,This is an excellent study guide. I used to for study for the 2010 Census Job. The book was very helpful in this test. Practice Test and examples were excellent and detailed.
3,Decent,"The knife design itself is excellent. However its size simply makes it impractical for EDC. I'm sure that this knife might excel in certain situations but they are few and far between. Fixed blade knives can take abuse, folders are compact and easy to carry/access, this knife is neither."
4,Companion,"This CRKT knife design is my favorite, it has a good handle and blade design. The size is big enough to use for most outdoor needs! The blade release is a little difficult to use for blade closeing, but it is good for safety! When it is open it is as safe as a fixed blade! I highly recommend this knife."
3,HUGE,"See any other review of the M21 or M16 for the pluses to this knife, I'm sure there are many... and a description of the odd safety feature. I'm only going to talk about the negatives since I had it only a few days.I returned this knife... Here is why... It was HUGE. Plus the combination of the finger guard and the flipper being directly across from each other made the knife difficult to carry and remove from the pocket, widening the knife a good bit. I did not like this, and decided I did not want a knife this big and difficult to remove from the pocket. The handle was aluminum, and scarred quickly and easily and noticeably in just a couple of days. The handle was also very slippery.I did not care for the knife. If the above issues won't bother you I'm sure it would be a great knife."
1,The Great Revolution?,"I picked up this text while researching intersex and transsexual sociology. I assumed from the title and the concept of sex, gender, social change and 'revolution' that I would find something useful regarding the varied issues surrounding gender in the 21st century. BOY, was I mistaken! Gender and sex in this text refer to male/female binary and the old discourse of patriarchy. A flippant reference to Michael Jackson's gender image alluding to ""a possible third sex"" was hilarious! Yet this was one of the only references to the concept of gender bending. I mean, really, I expected more in a discussion of sex role and social change."
5,Wow!!,"This book points to so much truth it is amazing.I think it is well written and written in a way that makes what is very philosophical easy to understand.His message is so simple yet so profound.I have read many, many books on spirituality and the teachings of the great teachers and none has hit home as much as this.I think this book could easily guide someone to a life changing way of Being. It has made me want to see the world in a whole new light. I feel enlightened just writing this!!!I highly recommend it."
1,another bad book from cisco press,"Once again, cisco press has enlisted people who should not be writing books to write books. The authors, reviewers, and the editors have no clue what they are writing. I can tell they don't even know the subject well. They copied and pasted from the cisco's website and it has typos everywhere. Shame on the authors, reviewers, and the editors. Shame! Shame! Shame!"
3,Some Kind of Mixup!!,"The CCSP SNRS Exam Certification Guide is to prepare you for the new Cisco exam 642-502, as shown in the cover illustration. However the Amazon product description on the day I write this and the earlier reviews all refer to another book which prepared an older exam, the 642-501 SECUR. Although there is alot of overlap in content, the exam objectives are not completely the same.Hopefully the book authors have done a better job updating their material than the people publishing the product descriptions.I used the older book to prepare the original 642-501 exam and my main complaint was the lack of fully working sample configs. I passed the multiple choice exam but there are still some features I haven't gotten to actually work on live routers."
1,"Exam Retired, do not buy this book","While I'd rate the book a five star if it was still useful, the exam is now retired. There should be another book coming out for the new version of the exam. Check at Cisco Press, or wait until Amazon gets the new books. Purchasing this book would be a waste of money. While most of the material is the same, there are significant new areas that are just not covered in this version that you need to know for the new test."
5,more than a regional mystery,"I loved this book. It is a good regional murder mystery, but it is more than that. It is social satire: Lexus-driving yuppie men gather in the mountains around the campfire on the weekends to beat drums and search for their inner child, all the while conspiring to enrich themselves at the expense of the townspeople. It is a couple of love stories: about the hero whose girlfriend has inexplicably disappeared, and about the irascible blind detective and his loving wife of many years who help him find her. And it is above all a very funny book that exposes the hypocrisy of politicians and the rich. While he is compared to Tony Hillerman, I think Westbrook is more like Florida's Carl Hiaasen and Randy Wayne White although not nearly as insanely inventive -- which can be a relief."
5,Great Storyteller,"Robert Westbrook shows his talent and his literary roots in his new mystery series. Also author of Intimate Lies, Westbrook knows the Southwest first-hand. He draws you into the outsider viewpoint and tells an intriguing story. The Warrior Circle mystery illuminates the dark places of men's emotions and greed that drive them to evil deeds."
5,"Standtastic 122 KSB 48"" Double-Tier Keyboard Stand with Deluxe Bag","Well made and when keyboards are set on it , it becomes very stable. Very easy set up second or third time after that set up is quick. Great purchase."
3,"O.K., but not great","This wallet is probably a good deal for the price, but it isn't a particularly great product. The wallet itself is pretty narrow, just barely wide enough to hold a credit card in the appropriate pocket. In addition, one of the seams inside the wallet had been halfway missed by the stitching, so that's an honest quality control issue. If it matters, the plastic card holder insert also falls out very easily. Like I said, O.K. for the price, but not great."
4,good game,"this game was fun and hard to play.lots of explosions ( you get C4, carpet bombs, air strikes, RPGs, anti-air, and lots of others)lots of guns ( carbines, snipers, shotguns, SMGs, assualt rifle and lots more)All though this game was fun to play it took a while to get used to and after a certain point it became more of a chore to play it.frequent deaths, mission failures, and factions hating you it kinda got me angry.this is a game you will probaly buy, play it once or twice and then let it sit on your shelf for the next couple of years"
4,Lets Blow Something Up!!!,"I rated this game a 4 overall just because of no option for 2-player mode. Other than that, this is a no holds bar explosion fest. if it exists, you can blow it up, if it has wheels or moves, you can hi-jack it. Mercenaries has an open map much like the GTA series with side mission along the way. You work several different factions, or countries, like the Russian Mafia, China, Allies, South Korea and North Korea. You work each one against the other, without getting yourself killed in the middle. in the meanwhile, you are working on a ""Deck Of 52"" cards, 52 of the most wanted dictators and drug cartel. So you will have plenty of playing time, and lots to do. this game should last you a while before completely beating it. have FUNNN with this one."
5,Awesome Fun Time,What a great game to roam around and blow stuff up. If you get bored playing this you are doing it wrong. It is expansive mayhem with a touch of chaos mixed with C4.
4,Mercenaries review,"After seeing commercials for this game that said you can highjack, blow up, destroy, and drive pretty much everything you can find i had to find out if this was true. This is a great alternative to Halo 2 with simple controls that take five minutes max to learn. The graphics are great, especially if you are blowing up a car or helicopter.Pros:1. open enviroment which allows you to make a name for yourself2. your actions have consequences.(such as if you kill a UN soldier the UN faction won't like you as much)3.solid graphics4.expansive territory5.you can drive or fire anything you find which makes the game feel more real6.deep story line7.simple controls8.a cheat weapons drop9.there are North Korean bases everywhere which are fun to destroyCons:1.after a while the game becomes monotonous2.stupid A.I.3.some missions are impossible without cheats"
4,Doesn't have everything. But still fun.,"This game is an awsome game. It has great graphics, huge playing areas, and many different weapons and vehicles to play around with. But it lacks the things that make a game GREAT. It lacks a tutorial level. They expect you to learn the game as you go. And who dares make a game today without a multiplayer mode?! The only reason why I rated this 4 stars and not 5, was because of the lack of multiplayer mode. But if I was faced with the decision to buy this game or not, I would definatly purchase this great game."
5,yes,"Mercenaries is an excellent game. Like everyone's said, it's like Grand Theft Auto. You roam around a huge map and do missions or take on challenges or try to collect things, or you can blow up monuments for rewards. Pretty much all the buildings are destructable. You get to carry two weapons, plus grenades. The controls are very good, I never have a problem with them, especially since I've played Star Wars Battlefront a lot and this is from the same people. I was disappointed in the lack of a side-roll, but I haven't actually needed it during any of the many firefights this game has.Hijack flying helicopters, run up the turret of a tank and throw grenades inside, level cities, and pretty much destroy everything you see. That's what this game is all about. If you don't need such overrated elements such as story and character development, this should be perfect for you."
3,"""Mercenaries"" delivers fun and ECON 101 lesson","Great game, easy learning curve, and rather open game play that allows you to do what you want to achieve mission success. ""Nerd-Core"" for the arm chair warriors at a good price. This is a good stocking stuffer for your teenager (naturally I had to test it to ensure quality). Bonus! Introduces fundamentals of Economics 101. Hey - mercenaries have to balance the checkbook too!"
2,"Mercenaries - eh, don't waste your time","This game was ok not good or great, but I could not distinguish what side to fight, a little confusing. There are glitches throughout the game. GTA III is better than this game."
5,Music to die for!!!,"Amazingly beautiful music!!!!A milestone, important also to introduce to all young Musicians too! Filmmusic is such an important thing, without good music there is no film!"
5,MOVIE MUSIC LOVERS...HERE IT IS!,"For anyone who ever loved the lush, instrumental, romantic score of a movie, this album gives you everything you could ever want - like a gigantic chocolate cake with rich, buttery frosting on top (if you are a chocoholic, as most romantics tend to be...) You will recall, with moist eyes, your first viewing of the classic films remembered here, from the simple, heartbreaking beauty of Cinema Paradiso to the lovely, rain-swept streets of Cherbourg, to the haunting images of Schindler's List. Every track is played with passion and gusto, and some of these classic instrumental compositions are even given a ""lift"" by Perlman's interpretations, in a way that improves upon the original. Gorgeous and unforgettable -- one to own and play play play..."
2,cinema serenate,"I received the wrong produt, but i contact the seller and he sad that will send to me the oder one, without cost."
1,not worth it,"This lamp is NOT WORTH the $$$. We bought lamps at ikea that are better than this!! The base only has metal on the top. Cheap felt-like material is exposed at the bottom of the base, instead of other lamps in which the metal extends down to the very bottom of the base. Also, it took a lot of time tucking the cord underneath to make it stable on the table. It still wobbles!!!"
1,"loudest muffler ever, terrible drone","Using the flowmaster website I picked this muffler as it was one of their lowest interior resonance and lowest external sound. I started my 2000 Tundra with the V8 with no muffler before I installed this. After I installed this muffler I could not tell a difference. It was terrible. I can not stand driving down the road at 50-70mph with this muffler. You can not hear yourself think in the cab of the truck, let alone hear a radio or carry on a conversation.Stay away from this muffler/brand/series."
1,wrong product,This is not what it is advertised to be. It arrived and it was an oil cap! Don't be fooled into buying
2,Where are the real REMIXES?!,"I love Elton just as much as the next guy, but this CD is very misleading - ELTON JOHN REMIXED?! Hardly. I respect Ashley Beedle for not messing with genius, but this ""remix"" of the lost disco classic ARE YOU READY FOR LOVE? is really just an anemic, pointless exxxxxtended version adding nothing new to the original - better to have included the real remixes of this track only found on ltd. ed. import cd, like remixes by LINUS LOVES and FREEFORM FIVE for starters, who both reinvent the track for tougher underground clubs. Also, what with all the bootlet mash-ups flooding the market over the years of remixed old classics by Elton, such as HOUSE MIXES of YOUR SONG, ROCKET MAN, and more, why not comission today's hottest remixers/producers and really do it right? Elton has a wealth of riches, none of which are exploited, or at least reimagined, here. Save your eight clams."
3,You might end up with less than you bargained for...,"Now, I am not particularly a grand toy collector. However, everyone has Disney toys here and there sometimes, and for me, I basically got this toy because I wanted to listen to The Lion King Kidclips on it. I personally think all together, this was quite an expensive toy (keep in mind that's including the toy AND the clips.) The reason I was disapointed was mainly because of the price, and it was because you are paying about four or five dollars a clip, which equals out to four or five dollars for about one minute of music...! What a rip-off! If your children dearly like the Disney music, you should consider buying the soundtracks, where you get more for your money. I don't know -- this is my humble opinion, keep in mind. but whatever I can do to help if you are curious. Thanks for reading, and I hope I was helpful."
1,Awful.,"This book is frequently inaccurate, horribly badly proofread (typos on almost every page), and full of fatuous sidebars that contribute nothing. I feel that this book might have been ok if a decent editor, copy editor, and technical reviewer had worked it over. Without that it's worthless."
4,A Path to Enlightenment,I found reading this book truly worthwhile. The book is enlightening and thought provoking by taking one's understanding of religion to a new level. Wentz deconstructs religion to its elements and examines how fanaticism and wrong doing in the name of religion have developed. The book explains how all humans are in some way religious and how people allow that religiousness to be imprisoned within walls of their own mind's making. This creates a sense of close-mindedness which ultimately leads to the violence which is all too common in the world today. Wentz draws from doctrines and diciples from around the world and throughout history which emphasize the universality of his message. Richard Wentz has imparted to the rest of the world an amazing book which gives us a map to follow on the way to becoming better persons and true diciples of the human spirit.
1,"Extremely unintuitive interface, useless documentation","I do actually own this software for my Mac, and I can confirm that it's pretty awful and can only be recommended for those willing to spend the weeks learning its embarrassingly unintuitive interface. I've had mine for several weeks now, and I still haven't figured out how to save or export my RAW files to JPEG. This apparently is accomplished by a custom-made ""process"" (in itself difficult to find and configure), but nowhere does Phase One say how to execute a ""process"". The documentation is atrocious, and the online support virtually non-existent. I'm really not sure what you're getting for $400, since I have yet to get it do carry out the simplest of tasks.I never thought I'd encounter photography software that would make Photoshop seem downright intuitive and easy to use, but here it is! The best thing I can say for this software is that Phase One does allow you to download a trial version to see for yourself how bad it is."
5,A Must-Have Gardening Book.,"This book is very informative and a pleasure to read. The author is both knowledgable and opinionated and even if one doesn't always agree with her, her humor is very funny; dry, understated, and British. Most of the plants she mentions are pictured somewhere in the book, and where the picture isn't on the same page as the description, the page number to locate the picture is in the margin right next to the written description. A great job and an excellent book!"
1,a quick death,I got this as a gift from my wife just this past Christmas. It completely died mid-song while I was walking to the supermarket. And that was only the fourth or fifth time that I used it.Caveat emptor.
3,"Really awesome player, but not that reliable","I owned a 2GB V plus a couple of years ago. It was awesome until the OLED screen died. Creative like most other MP3 producers like Apple, San Disk, etc. do not have great warranties. I would recommend purchasing Creative's extended warranty, offered through their website. It extend coverage to parts and labor to 2 full years.Besides the reliability issues, this is a really great player. The one thing that I don't like is the FM tuner. It doesn't work well, and I still don't understand how to preset stations."
1,piece of junk,"bought in jan 08, died in feb 09. had a couple of freeze-ups prior to dying this month. pc stopped recognizing it last month & now won't even turn on now. really disappointed in this creative product."
2,2nd Zen that broke down,"I have had both an 4GB and 8GB Creative Zen V Plus, and the first died in about 5 months, the second in about 10. I'm going to try a different brand and see if it lasts longer."
3,Where is the instruction book?,"I just got this 8gig mp3 player. Using the Zen V Media Explorer I was able to load songs and generate a playlist. I can play the playlist.HOWEVER, there are no instructions for anything. I cannot even get the main menu to come up (actually, I did it once and can't do it again as I don't remember the magic set of keystrokes required). Also, I understand it has an FM radio, but can't see how to turn it on. There needs to be an instruction manual. I surfed the web trying to find something like this and only ran across blogs bemoaning the same thing I am complaining about. So, if anyone knows of online instructions or tips, please let me know at bwolfe01@yahoo.com. Thanks.Having vented, I must say I really like the size and quality of the player. It seems to be really nice and, with an instruction manual, I might give it 5 stars."
5,AWESOME!!,"I really like this new zen!!its so small and it fits just nice in my hand..and the sound quality is great,apart from the joystick being too small which makes it hard to scroll to the next song..other than that its a great buy!"
3,"Tiny player that works well, is tough","This does everything it supposed to do. It sounds good. It is very tough, I have dropped it several times - if this was a hard-drive based player I am sure it would be out of commission. The software makes it easy to transfer files. The controls are easy to use. It has been problem free for 10 weeks.The negatives are:1. It charges too slow on the USB via the computer. I bought the wall charger which works fine.2. the ear foam comes off easily.3. The on/off switch must be held down for about a second to work.Update: August 8, 2010 this thing died. It wasn't the battery. I had it plugged into the Creative Labs charger, and was listening at the same time."
4,I Love It!,I liked my Zen Plus 4G so much that I decided to get my daughter the 8G for her birthday. I'm very happy with this product. I've had several mp3 players and this is the best yet.
3,not made well and different colors than shown.,"I bought this as a gift for a friend's little girl. Don't expect the doll to be the same as in the picture. The doll i received has a purple top and no ruffle around the waist. The flowers are different too.Her dress is too small. I can't even velcro the back closed. Her hair came frayed on the top and was put up poorly, leaving a gap of the back of her head the width of my pinky. I tried to fix it by tucking a bit. Her tiara is sewn on crooked.The dolls are cute, but don't expect high quality manufacturing."
2,What can I say?,The music contained in this cd was interesting for about five minutes. It was all I could do to avoid fast forwarding through the pieces (I wanted to give it a fair shake). The ensemble performers are very good. I'd be interested in other recordings they've done but the arbitrary structure of some of the compositions on this cd blew past pretentious and raced toward the proverbial train wreck. The next day after recieving this disc it found its way to a new/used entertainment outlet.
1,A tragedy Indeed,"I found this book to tell many things of the famous star but left me seeing her as a train wreck other than a movie star. I am certain her daughters did give advise on this book, and sadly enough the children were the ones that were left to feel they were her heavy baggage of her sad and lonely life. I did not get all truths or facts from this book on her life, I felt so much was left ot not to make her seem as troubled and disliked as she was. Very sad ending, yes indeed."
1,Betty Grable- The Girl With Millions of Problems!,"After I read this book, I was hurt, because I saw Betty Grable in a different light, this book really shows the bad side of Betty, I don't know if this book is true, but if it wasn't, wouldn't the family sue. Even Betty Grable's daughters supposedly was interviewed for this book, and doesn't speak well of their mother. After I read it, no one could give me a good clear answer on this book, was it true or not? But for a while I couldn't watch or listen to Betty Grable, but then I noticed we all are human beings and we all make mistakes, and we shouldn't look at movie stars like their perfect, or have the perfect life, they make mistakes too, and they pay for it, just like all of us."
2,Beautiful Singing Sabotaged by Insipid Lyrics,"Kitch!Wonderful singing, really wonderful, but 12 (of 22) of the songs are marred by the insipid lyric translations of Merl Puffer and Deena Cavalieri. Unfortunately, the singers sing so well that you hear every word with crystal clarity. Here are some lines: Darling trust in me, for I'll always be a loving subject waiting your command...for a love sincere, conquers every fear...champagne will flow, and our hearts will glow...social pressures I faithfully shun, I defy, those who pry, boredom exists everywhere, and I'll escape from it's snare...ah, you see, what love can be...I languish as I linger, from love's fragile bloom, if you'll but raise a finger, I'll clime to your room, the night is growing colder, the world is growing older, don't turn an icy shoulder. I am no expert on poetry but I think that stuff is awful. If these lyrics won't bother you, these are beautifully sung operetta/show tunes. Tucker and Della Casa are fantastic."
5,publisher & a # 1 critic,"It is REALISM. All of these stories can happen to anyone, anywhere. The main 1 which caught my eye, was ""My Angel"", but not forgetting how the story of ""Maggie Gains her Revenge"", captured a full understanding of what people in these situations deal with. I've seen many of these about wanting revenge, but not a short like this. This author must have had some true experiences in their lifetime, or just did some excellent research. I can't believe the emotion and excitement this holds, for all of us to discover. This is their 1st and I actually can't wait to read the next ... and next."
5,A real tale of reality!!!,Well written and looking forward to reading more! You will not want to put this book down.
4,"Great recipes, bad printing","Wonderful book, unfortunately the publishers did a horrible job printing the colour photographs of some beautiful flies. Too bad, otherwise a great resource for those interested in historic BC patterns."
2,Expensive and hard to find!,"My daughter (4) did like this toy although I found it to be quite a rip off. The player was reasonably priced but the ""clips"" cost as much as buying a full length disney music CD and I could have bought her a cd player with real music cds for about the same cost. The music is just that...""clips"" of real songs which are very short in playing time and not the full length song. Yes this is kid friendly but for the money it wasnt worth it and the clips are almost impossible to find!"
5,One of the best of black lace series,Better than average story for the Black Lace series. Tess has a great variety of experiences.
5,"This is so great, that I am ordering another copy","I bought this as a gift for a friend who enjoys knowing all the lyrics of songs. In this book, he discovered some intros and verses he hadn't known.He has enjoyed the book so much that I am going to buy one for myself."
5,Love this book!,"Some months ago I skimmed through this book before giving it to someone who appreciates song lyrics more than melody. I've been coveting it since, and I've decided I've gotta have one. For me lyrics were secondary to the music. Reading them in this book without any musical distraction, I recognized the impressive sophistication of thought and feeling and cleverness of wordplay displayed therein. This book generates multiple pleasures--sweet nostalgia for the poignant yearnings of youth; appreciation for the literary value (yes!) of many of these lyrics; delight in finding added enjoyment in the songs I love; and happiness over being able to sing the lyrics of more than the first two lines of my many favorites. After you look through this book, you'll surely admit they don't write lyrics like they used to."
5,Essential reference book,"I got my copy from a used supplier as a remainder at a fine price. It is an essential compilation of great lyrics. Quite simply, if you like great music and the lyricists of the last century, how can you not seek this one out before it becomes hard to find."
3,Short Stories in a Venetian Setting,"This is a collection of fictional short stories about the daily lives of current residents of, or visitors to, Venice. They provide a glimpse into the workings of the city that would be largely unavailable to the tourist. Each chapter focuses on a particular person, such as Postman, Architect, Socialite, Mason, Visitor, Gondolier and Mayor, with an interwoven narrative that connects them all. This is not a book about the history of, or sights to see in, Venice. The city serves largely as a backdrop to these stories of its inhabitants, although their stories provide new insights into the melancholy tale of the city. This is not a book to read before your first trip to Venice, but one perhaps best enjoyed after several visits there."
5,I felt like I was the proverbial fly on the wall,"Having read the whole book, I am delighted to find a potpourri of tales, something for everyone. The detail is enough for the mind's eye and ear to make it believe it is the proverbial fly on the wall. One story takes an Italian historical incident and rephrases it into a fictional story, illuminating a human frailty that most of us would secretly understand but hopefully not undertake. Others of these short stories show Freudian and Skinnerian insight into the mind and motives of mothers, rich relatives, aristocrats, and politicians; all topped with O'Henry-esque endings. Reading it was like eating and savoring spoonfuls of a sinfully delicious trifle. One knows one must stop eating, but maybe just a tidbit more, Please? Dave"
2,Not bad for a collection of short stories...,"I enjoyed almost all 12 stories in this book, and I liked how much of them interlock in some way or another. The descriptions of Venice made it come alive, and the different viewpoints encompassed a wide variety of people from a visitor to the city to the mayor. You could really tell that the author wanted you to see that the city's upper-class life was fading in most of the stories. However, I had some problems as well. About three of the stories I didn't really ""get"". They just seemed to make no sense whatsoever. I also found it odd she only wrote about four women, I had wished for more a balance there. Lastly, I often felt like the author was being condescending to the reader, which was a bit of a turnoff. Alright, but nothing great."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book prior to visiting Venice this summer in hopes that it would provide valuable insights about local culture. From that perspective it was a poor investment. The book offers minimal information about local customs, food, folklore or virtually any other aspect of Venetian life. What it did make overwhelmingly clear was that there is a well established party circuit for the rich and famous, but if you fit in those categories you probably already knew that.What sets the book apart is not so much the focus of the city, but that the writer has an old fashioned writing style that is both refreshing and frustrating at the same time.Venice is a uniquely beautifully and fascinating city. It's unfortunate that this book provides such a quirky perspective that is of little value to developing a better understanding and appreciation."
2,Did not come with insturctions,Our Rubik's did not come with instructions so once it was messed up it was impossible for my 12 year old son to fix. He would have really enjoyed this toy had it come with instructions so he could solve it.
2,Boring,I bought this for my 8 year old son who solved this in less then 5 minutes. So has our 9 year old daughter. This toy is not challanging at all. I wish I had bought the original!
1,Incoherent,"From my personal Course Evaluation - ""The chosen course text, in its entirety leaves the reader EVERYTHING to be desired. The text reads like a medical thesis. Each chapter is chock-full of redundancy. The author has painstakingly gone over each and every paragraph with a thesaurus to remove any flow of thought in order to come across as overly-educated. Not a single thought process is easily defined by the reader, nor can any information be disseminated from this text to correlate with exams or class discussion. The text is also full of spelling errors and missing pages. I completely recommend a rethinking of course material for future students."""
3,Not what we thought.,We ordered five sets of these and opened one pack but they weren't what we thought they would be. We returned the four packs.
4,The Engagement,"The movie was ok, but nothing really to get excited about. It was definitely a low budget movie."
3,Funny but hard to read,"I don't deny the author's sense of humor. In general it's a funny book. But his writing skills hardly qualify him for an editor in chief of a major publishing house. Why? Because he tends to write very long sentences, wandering off in the middle. Very often when I finish a sentence I already forget what he was talking about at the beginning of it. I suspect he is trying to show off that he is English. In fact I get a very strong impression that he is a snobbish person, not very personable or pleasant, not the type of person you will like unfortunately."
1,Awful,"I thought this book was going to be like ""A Year in Provence."" It is basically, rich snobby guy with ""former model"" wife moves to the country and continue to be rich snobby country folk. The only people who would be interested in this are other rich people who did the same thing. I was so irritated by the guy I could barely get to chapter 3. I am a working slob who will always be a working slob, so maybe I am biased--but I don't have time to waste on books like this."
1,A rich man's self-absorbing babble,"This book gives you a good picture of life in the country (country here meaning two hours away from Manhattan), if you have a British blonde model as a 2nd wife whose passion is foxhunting and horseback riding, four horses in the barn, two stable hands, a Hungarian mother and daughter team to cook your dinners for you, an interior decorator to dress your house in imported fabric from Italy, and a full-time help who mows your grass and takes care of all your country needs.In sum, the pleasure of moving to the country for Mr. Korda: looking at the forty acres and thinking: ""it's all mine."" And the tribulation: being snubbed by even richer friends because his estate is not as grand as the next person's.Do not even make the mistake of opening this book."
2,Very funny but not in the way the author intended,"If you have read A Year In Provence or any other of the many books of this genre you already know what this book is about.Instead of laughing at the locals and the countryisms I was laughing at the author's unbelievable name dropping and snobbery. His every extravagant expenditure is detailed in order for you to be sure of his status in the community. The other things he thinks will interest you are his showbiz friends, his English ancestry, his horsey activities, etc. In fact as I read the book I found myself betting when the next boastful statement would pop up. However, I would say it's a good read if only for those reasons.The author can be happy now in the knowledge that all of neighbors now what a grand person they have in their midst."
2,Spare me Mr. Korda,"I was about halfway through this work when I began to read the reviews here. I was heartened to find that I was not alone in finding Korda's tone condescending, snobbish, and in its own way, extremely provincial. He seems to value his neighbors, if at all, for one reason: their utility. That is, their usefulness to himself! He displays very little genuine interest in these hardworking people in terms of their histories, their interior lives, their unique stories. They're just there to fix stuff and do the physical labor which is apparently beneath Mr. Korda.Despite the author's long-time position as editor at Simon and Schuster, I did not find the book particularly well-written. Indeed, I found it riddled with cliches, especially ""in our neck of the woods."" Did the editor not submit his work to an editor?I almost always finish books once I start them. In this case I made an exception. Life is too short to read unfunny and basically insufferable books like this one."
3,A touch of snobbery,"Witty and hilarious anecdotes, well observed and cleverly described, make up the first part of this book. Apparently Mr. Korda ran out of material, for he has resorted to a series of faintly condescending tales of how his presence elevated the tone of the neighborhood to extend to book length what should have been an amusing article. There is a distinct sense of ""not quite our class, dear"" in his descriptions of his neighbors, his adopted countryside, the available local food, and the level of ambient taste. A bit less self-congratulation would have made this book more palatable."
1,Wrong Part Twice.....,"The part description and part number and picture was correct, but I receive aluminum shift knobs.... so called them and reordered and received the same wromg part again!!!!!!!!!"
1,Wrong Parts TWICE hold up job!,"I ordered distributor gears.........I got shifter knobs..........TWICE!!After waiting more than a week the first time, I sent back the improperly pulled parts with a note to ""Please have someone that knows what a gear is pull the parts"" I waited another week or more just to get two more shift knobs............... Very disappointing when a car is sitting in my garage waiting for the parts. More than two weeks later, I just sourced the parts from another company. I don't know which outfit had these parts, but they are either not very smart or trying to pull a fast one hoping I'd just get frustrated and keep the wrong parts. Amazon should strongly reprimand this company for making them look bad.The good news is the Amazon help desk worker was very apologetic and helpful. Great customer service on Amazon's part!! Thanks."
1,wrong item delivered twice!,I ordered this gear and received an ugly after-market 5-speed shift handle. I called customer service and they submitted another order. 3 days later I received another ugly shift handle. My next call to customer service did not solve this issue.
2,disappointing,"While this album is pleasant enough, it is more orchestra music than classical guitar. John Williams is a great classical guitarist, but the guitar part on this album could have been played by any competent guitarist. If you want nice background music, this album is ok. If you want classical guitar music, look elsewhere."
3,Good CD for Relaxing,Heard one song on this CD on the radio so bought the whole thing. As usual all the cuts are not as great as the one tune but the CD is worthwhile anyway. It is more orchestral than guitar than I expected but this is not a bad thing. Certainly worth the price and delisvered promptly in perfect condition.
1,The music is not of the standard one would expect,"Williams has embarassed himself with this half hearted effort.The music is cliched,soppy and well within the capabilities of the well-practiced primary school student.You don't play Bryan Adams on the classical guitar."
2,Take the X-tra out of Ordinary,"This book started out fine but about midway fizzled out. LuLu is pumped up to be this young girl who is smart and will save everyone and it is such a let down. Grossly, this book also gives new meaning to the monthly curse.Warning: Ending Revealer: don't read further if you don't want to knowThe ending is just so lame with no explanation as to why unlike the others, she can't talk, move or leave the glass case they milk her from."
1,Are they supposed to be Xtreme zombies? Don't get it.,"Hmm, well it started out slow and then quickly regressed into a retarded nightmare full of odd characters and weird situations. Course what could be weirder than a zombie book? A dumb one? Maybe I'm expecting too much. The zombies, oh I'm sorry Xombies turn blue and its spread by women, unless they aren't getting their monthlies. The ending was hard to understand and didn't make much since and what I mean by that is, is it was pretty disjointed and seemed as though the author wanted to think up some surprise ending that would maybe shock the reader and leave us dismayed, but it really didn't. It was more of a dispointing ending. Hard to understand, didn't enjoy, trying to be too fresh, while just ended up being a bad deal all around.I've only read one other zombie book other than this, and it wasn't any better, so maybe I'll just stick to the movies. Shaun of the Dead is good, go check that out."
2,"not really zombies, ending fizzled","These Xombies aren't really zombies. They could be said to have zombie-like qualities, as a chimp has human-like qualities, but they don't eat living humans so much as they spread their virus voraciously. The story was entertaining enough until the end when the ""mystery"" was explained, then it became ridiculous and I skimmed the last 50 pages merely to get the gist of it."
2,If you like zombies . . . read something else,"This book was millions of miles away from Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, or Lord of the Flies, or any of the other things it's been compared to. I found it very promising to begin with, with some very interesting twists on the usual ""zombie"" story. After it starts off as a somewhat original zombie story, it hops and jumps all over the place. It just got worse and worse, even crossing the line into ""silly."" The whole submarine thing got tired very quickly, and once they got to the ""base"" it got completely ridiculous. Nonsensical plot twists and ""gotcha"" non-endings were problems as well. It turned into a bad 70s sci fi feature. Two specific things that don't give away the story: a xombie-killing baboon and a Beatles tribute band made up of Pakistanis. Anyway, I don't recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of zombie books and movies. Skip this and re-read Keene's The Rising."
4,More than Xombies,When I first read this I thought of zombies front to back blood shed and cahos. The more I read it the more it went into the survival of the fitest.This is not one if you want blood and killing the whole way but it is a great book indeed. I am one to take at least 3 weeks to get through a book and I finished this in 3 days. I was drawn to the fight for survival and wanting to know what was going to happen.Yes it gives women a view as being the breeding ground and spreaders of this awful AgentX syndrom but that what was created by a man for power.
1,One of the Absolute worst books I have ever trudged thru...,"TERRIBLE, the character development was a joke.The slang used was painful to read and not at all the way a Naval Officer would speak. I wasted good money on this book and was thoroughly disapointed. Made absolutely no sense what so ever!"
3,One of the only books I stopped reading,"I had to put this book down when I was more than halfway through.It was slow, dull and predectable. I did not really enjoy the zombies that they put into this (everyons are diffrent now, but thats good).But who knows, I see alot of people like it and alot dont, so maybe you might want to play it safe and get it at a library, or at least buy it used to save a few bucks."
2,Started out good but quickly fizzled out,"Well, I gave this book the old 100 page try and gave up then. I have way too many books vying for my attention to force myself to finish a book that is boring me witless.Xombies started out well with a young girl named Lulu waking up one day to discover the world has gone mad and it seems that all women have turned into raging blue-faced Xombies due to some sort of disease. Lulu escapes this fate because she has a health condition that prevents her from maturing. After watching her mother turn blue, she escapes with an older male neighbor and they're on the run.This book started out with a lot of promise but soon became one big chase scene with lots of male posturing thrown in. I didn't care about any of these people and found the old guys accent distracting beyond all measure. I found myself skipping pages at a time and eventually gave up, read the end and passed the book along to next victim."
3,"It's like ""28 days later"", okay, but not great.","Yes, this book is good but not great. I hope the author is setting it up for a follow up becuse the ending is too depressing after everything poor Lulu has to go through and end up the way she did. In my opinon, you would be better off with ""Midnight"" by Dean Koontz or one of the Resident Evil books by S.D. Perry"
1,What were the publishers thinking!!!!,"I won't waste my time - like I did with reading Xombies - writing hundreds of words about just how terrible it was. But I will say that it is hundreds of pages of just rediculous sitiations and with equally unbelievable characters. I usually read a book in a week or two. It has taken me over a month to read the last fifty pages of Xombies. It is just aweful, even worse than Reign of the Dead. That is saying something."
2,Don't Bother... !,"GOOD IDEA: Write a book about a new kind of zombie.BAD IDEA: Let your reader KNOW, On Page -FRICKIN- TWO that your Main character doesn't live through to the end!!!REALLY BAD IDEA: Start a book with a new kind of zombie, an act that has merrit, and then populate your novel with cardboard cutouts of characters. Add to that that none of the characters are really likable or sympathetic, throw in a dose of apathy and add a subplot two thirds of the way through that makes little sense and stretches the bounds of credibility to the breaking point.Oh, and change your own rules whenever you need to in order to advance your ""plot""...I dunno, maybe the writer was sick the day he wrote this one, but my advise? STEER CLEAR!"
1,GARBAGE,"MAN, THIS MOVIE IS STRAIGHT GARBAGE. THE SCENES ARE TOO LONG, YOU GET BORED QUICK. THEYLL HAVE A SCENE OF DUDE WALKING INTO A ROOM, SITTING ON THE COUCH, THEN LAYING THERE, FALLING ASLEEP, AND IT WILL TAKE LIKE 4 LONG MINUTES OF JUST THAT. JUST SUCH A LACK OF SUSPENSE AND THE MUSIC JUST DOESNT COINCIDE WITH THE EMOTION THAT IS HAPPENING. IVE SEEN SOME BAD GHETTO MOVIES BEFORE BUT THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST. MAKES CHOICES AND CHOICES 2 LOOK LIKE MASTERPIECES. NAKED FINE HOES COULDNT HAVE SAVED THIS MOVIE AND THERE WASNT EVEN ANY OF THOSE IN IT!"
1,I AM SICK OF IT!!!!!!!!!,"I hate that song. Could they just play it maybe once a month or maybe once a year. Why did they have to play it every 5 minutes. I admit that I bought the C.D. But, I don't know or care where it is. Please everyone that plays it every minute get a life."
1,Treachliness Permeates Repellent Ballad,"By now Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" will have become one of the most-played songs ever heard. And each playing will no doubt make more people change their minds - the song has sold millions, but more and more people are beginning to see through the facade of beauty and catch on to the song's repellent treachliness.Celine Dion joins Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Madonna as a singer who cannot master any emotion other than whining. This is exactly the style she employs in this and other of her songs. Her whining, in fact, is about the only thing this song has going for it.We've been jackhammered with this and other Dion songs, and it has long since worn out its welcome."
4,Scintillating,"This release is a must have for any guitar fan or student, with pieces that display virtually every facet of guitar music. Grigoryan's technical ability and musicianship is uncanny - the playing is superb. It's the selection of tracks that bring the CD to life - and it still sounds fresh after countless listens, with this reviewer finding new layers to the music each time. Highlights are Deve Ser Amor (both versions), La Muerte del Angel, Tango En Skai and Lovelady's wistful Incantation."
1,Do not order from SportsMagick,"The company who is responsible for shipping this rug took over 2 months to ship my order. I called to cancel; the order was supposedly cancelled. Two days later, the rug appeared on my door step. It was packaged in such a way it would have cost me over $20.00 to send it back. I do not recommend ordering anything from this company!!"
5,I loved this book!,"A Whisper in the Wind is about time travel romance. The romance between the characters is a sweet, moving love story. Michael Wolf travels to the past to find the woman he has waited a life time for. That's so romantic. I love how the ending was resolved. I have read this book over and over. The story is truly touching. Baker has done it again with an outstanding Indian romance."
4,Missing Book details,"THE BLACK HILLS, 1876It was a land where a man could ride for days without seeing anything but fragrant pines, an occasional deer, or a lone eagle soaring in the limitless blue sky -- a land where the Indian still roamed wild and free -- a land that drew together two lovers to embrace a passionate destiny neither could have foreseen.THE CHEYENNEAccustomed to the ways of the white man, he returned to his tribe in search of a vision quest, to share with his people the glory and heartache of the last golden days before the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and to find the beautiful woman who haunted his dreams.ELAYNASheltered and innocent, she shared every civilized woman's fear of the Indian, until she was kidnapped by the darkly handsome Cheyenne. Slowly, her disdain changed to desire beneath his hard, bronzed body, until she would make any sacrifice to keep him by her side forever."
5,The Situation Is Hopeless But Not Serious (The Pursuit of Unhappiness) great read,"The Situation Is Hopeless But Not Serious (The Pursuit of Unhappiness) is a most useful work for studying the art of staying positive in today's world. writes for ""everyman"" and this totally enjoyable conceptually rich book is powerful and fun. Novel combination."
3,A little disappointing.,"Paul Watzlawick has written some really exceptional material, but I found this book to be less so. I did finally get a very useful insight near the end, but I felt like I was going through a lot of repetitive material. Kind of like a long run for a short slide. For a more enjoyable read by the same author, try ""Change: Principles of Problem Formation and Problem Resolution."" For me his best was ""How Real is Real? (An Anecdotal Introduction to Communication Theory)"" , now out of print and a classic."
4,Great book,Interesting book about bilingualism and research related to it. It is very useful for the class I'm taking in school
1,a waste of $1.99,this has gotta be the worst movie I have ever seen . Nothing happens till the very end and that is the best part. LOL
3,Industrial Oilfield User,"Ordered four of these units. The seals work well with varsol, and brake cleaner. The issue I have with this bottle is the tab that holds the stem on the sprayer actuator. ??. The spring seems to be too strong and so when pressing down on the thumb actuator, eventually it wears down the tab, at the contact of the plunger arm. This results in the sprayer not working because it becomes impossible to pull the plunger back. Have 2 failed in the first 2 weeks of use. the other two are backup bottles, so we will get to see if these two last the next two weeks."
2,Easy to Forget,"Jenni Alpert has a breathy voice that somewhat resembles Suzanne Vega. ""I hope that God is watching. I hope that He can see what we have done,"" she sings on the opener ""Baltimore"" that has a haunting quality. Unfortunately, as a singer, Alpert slides off and around notes rather than actually hitting them. Her band does a great job backing her. ""Fallin"" is a bluesy weeper that brings to mind Louise Taylor's excellent CDWritten in Red. However, as a vocalist, Alpert's voice wisps around her notes & does not resonate like Taylor's affecting singing. As a songwriter, Alpert's songs often create a mood as in ""Below Sea""; however, they also fail to stick in your head after you listen to them. ""Black Crow"" is a dreamy songscape with strings that only needs a more memorable melody to connect. Alpert has a great band. But the vocals and the material make this set easy to forget. Taxi!"
4,A Very Usefull Book,"This is a very usefull book, and that is why I am buying another copy. This book like a few other chess books in my collection has simply fallen apart. The pages give way and I've lost some important detail. I wish they had made this book more user friendly. I have much older and equally used books that are not like that. Other than that it's a find book, and I wish you a lot of luck with it."
5,Superb book,This is a must have book for queen pawn players. Mednis gives good understandable annotations that are very accessable to average player. If positional chess baffles you or if you believe that tempi do not matter in closed games this book will cure both conditions. I recommend this book for any and all tournament players and I hope that you will enjoy this book as I have.
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book on closed games. You'll learn much morehere than in any book on any opening. Mednis did exactly what should be done : 90% textual explanations and only 10% variations.And it's not only a book dealing with openings; there are comments throughout the game. Too bad he isn't here with us anymore. The only tiny complaint I'd have is that he should have included gamesfrom other closed openings instead of including too many games in the same opening (There are 4 Catalan games , 4 Tarrasch QGD ). But this in no way detracts from the book."
2,Bad Title. It's not a strategy book.,"This is a book about openings. It's not your typical strategy book. Since it is an openings book, the material is very outdated. If you want to learn about the ideas behind the openings then I would recommend Discovering Chess Openings by Emms. If you are want a more detailed book on all the major openings then I would get Fundamental Chess Openings. FCO is a good reference book, but for the most part, it just lists moves and doesn't try to teach you about opening theory. If you are looking for a strategy book then I suggest Modern Chess Strategy by Pachman."
4,A colorful look at the trials and tribulations of cat life!,"My infant son loves this book! It has delightful, brightly colored illustrations, a catchy rhyme, and for me, a humorous look at two cats learning to share living quarters.The underlying message of sharing and getting along seems well-suited for a preschooler as well."
4,"Clever, fun text and pictures!","I initially got this book from the library for my 2 1/2 year old. She was amused enough, but my husband and I were delighted with the illustrations and creative text layout. It's one book of our daughter's of which he and I haven't grown bored. I'm buying this as a gift for my friends' kids who are expecting the arrival of a sibling - might be some interesting similarities :^)"
1,resident and student review,"The only reason that I own this book is beause I received it for free. Information is sketchy and difficult to find in the book without an index or table of contents. (Subject matter is arranged in alphabetical order). Bottomline - even if you have unlimited money, dont squander your pocket space."
3,This stroller is too big,"The stroller is sturdy and has lots of pockets to keep things in. But it is much larger than the other double jogging strollers I have seen. Because of its size it isn't very convenient to take to the zoo, and I could never take it to the mall. If you are tall and your intent is to keep in on trails and in the neighborhood this will suite fine. You will need another double stroller - a more compact one for public places."
4,Step One: Have the stroller delivered.,"I am sure this is a good stroller (that's why I bought it!)My ""review"" is more of a word of caution: this thing takes forever to arrive. Don't be fooled: ""Usually ships within 24 hours"" really means ""May ship sometime"". As of 2/8/06, our stroller has not arrived. It was ordered January 1, 2006. It is not even slated to ship for another week (we'll see...).Meanwhile, the local store has several in stock.My advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion: go to your local store. Otherwise, be prepared to wait a very long time."
2,bummed out!!!!,"We ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly.Our children are 2.5 and 10 months. Our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support. Also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield,and peek a boo window cracking, also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric. The kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in Mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when my two kids were in it. It cloapsed because the locking system melted..... oops, I guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test!!!"
2,Tried to like it...,"But after ordering it twice from Amazon, and having both arrive either defective or damaged, I give up on this stroller. First one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky - one side longer than the other - therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly. So we returned it to Amazon and were sent a new one. It arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway...put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it. Veered to the right, and after close inspection, once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up, probably during shipping. Also my 2 1/2 year old's head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is VERY heavy and hard to turn. (yes I knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn, etc.)Too bad, I really wanted to like this stroller, but I just don't have much faith in the company anymore."
3,Too tall and the basket falls off all the time,"This mega stroller is great exept for 2 things:1. it is way too tall for maneuvering and handling it up and down sidewalks and2. the basket is cliped on (see picture) with pressure so it falls off with whatever you may place underneath.We use it for the beach a lot and have ended up putting towels and bags up on the canopy to avoid a stream of objects on the pavement along our way.There are other, more compact looking double joggers."
5,Great stroller!,"We're not really into jogging, but needed a stroller that could handle gravel or dirt paths, since most of the parks and recreational places in our area don't have paved paths. I really like the large storage area under the seats and it even has pockets behind each seat. The handle bar is comfortable to grip and the stroller rides very smoothly. The stroller also fits very nicely, once it's folded up, into the back of our Ford Escape. Also, it's very easy to fold up and easy to load. We are very happy with this stroller."
1,Extremely disappointed,"We were swayed by the positive Amazon reviews but have been extremely disappointed in this poorly made stroller. Of the many design flaws, I'll specifically name 4:(1) The sun/rain hood has nothing to keep it down, any bit of wind causes it to flap backwards on itself(2) Turning requires significant downward force on the handle bar to lift the front wheel. Unfortunately, the ""adjustable"" handle bar clicks out of position every time you push down on it to turn. Very annoying.(3) The steering was out of alignment from day 1. On inspection, it looks like the frame was constructed wrong is or misaligned.(4) The foot brake fell off after a week.Do yourself a favor-try before you buy, and look at other options. This stroller is not worth the money."
1,Poor quality,I never even got to use this stroller. The first one I receviedwas damaged and mising parts. The second one I received was also missing parts. I wasn't even able to contact X-Tech because the phone number was out of order. Not recommended.
5,Christina: Saigon's Heart,"As a Vietnam war veteran, as a writer and a school teacher, I found this book to be a spell - binding story. It was consumed by war, love, and CIA intrigue. There can be no doubt why it is classified as fiction. The CIA would punish the author for calling it truth.But it is obviously concerned with the magnetic personality the woman called Christina (Lu-Tang). She is one of the most dynamic personalities to be found in literature today. Intellectual, beautiful, and highly action oriented, she will no doubt be the heroine character of some movie in the future.I dare to believe that this author was writing of someone who actually lived. Maybe for that reason I could not put it down.Who knows?"
4,Motorola MD 491 review,"I purchased this phone system with 2 cordless extensions and the corded base unit. I really like this system. This system is easy to use. Volume controls are easily accessible. Answering machine can be fully accessed from the extensions, as well as the base unit. I highly recommend the purchase of this unit. You will not be sorry."
2,Poor sound quality,I wanted to like this phone. Very cool easy to use features.The problem? Poor sound quality. Sorry all the coolness andfeatures in the world will not make up for that. While I hadthis system I was comparing to a Panasonic KX-TG2583S. That phonehas issues but not will sound.
4,Good value,"The phone system was easy to install and setup. It also provides you with a corded phone that has a battery backup (4 AAs)in case of a power outage, which was my main objective. It also gives the flexiblility of additinal extenstions which have many features, i.e. message indicators on the extentions, so you don't have to be at the base to receive or be alerted to a new message. The orange backlighted panel is good in all lighting conditions."
2,solid base with bad handsets,"We got this phone (base with two handsets) three years ago for close to $150. The reception was good, the base is solid. We love the walkie-talkie feature. But as many reviewers said the phonebook is annoying, no search function at all. That's not the worst, both handsets lost function of quite some buttons. One is impossible to use other than taking a call. I am not sure if Motorola is bad at this or what. I own a simple Motorola cell phone, which also has two keys lost function. In addition, the handsets had very short battery life, talking maximum 20 min. The phone including the base will not ring sometimes, I am not sure it's the problem of the phone or the phone service company (Vonage). Now we are looking to just change the handsets, not sure if other brands' handsets will work with this phone base."
1,MD491 2.4 GHZ Not worth your time,"Although this phone looks very sheek and had all the features we wanted it had terrible reception. No matter how close you got to the base you could hear static and you got that feedback where you can hear yourself talking. Other than the reception the phone was perfect, but since a phone is more about how it works than what it has I have to give this one only one star. By the way we tried two of this model before we moved on to the 5.8GHZ."
3,Where's the Pepto-Bismol?,"This is a mordant, darkly comic tale of obsession spanning three generations. Captivating in its grossness, this is definitely not one for the squeamish. It's difficult to divine exactly what this movie is supposed to tell us, if it's attempting to tell us anything at all. The characters are uniformly grotesque, the plot is slight, and any possible meaning is distinctly nebulous. Palfi appeals to the viewer's voyeuristic tendencies and, it has to be said, not much else. But as a study of bodily compulsions it's interesting enough."
3,Doesn't Hold Together,"After seeing clips of Taxidermia on YouTube, I thought I had found a really powerful (if somewhat tasteless) movie. Unfortunately, it turns out that most of the best parts were those clips. The story of three generations starts out strong enough (think Wozzeck), but quickly deteriorates; the ending is a unsuccessful attempt to be shocking for the sake of being shocking. Rent, but don't buy.The soundtrack (by Amon Tobin) is another matter entirely: excellent!"
4,funny,"This show has me laughing, I think it has been cancelled which is a shame because I was really enjoying it"
2,Video does not run consecutively/continuously through each episode.....From beginning to end . I find it inconvenient to wat,I find it inconvenient and distracting to have to return back to My Video Library every 20 minutes to proceed to the next episode.....even if it could function as a disc and several episodes would play continuously would be helpful.
4,Very Funny,"My husband recommend this series and it was surprisingly good. What's weird is that I actually tried to watch this series when it was on air and didn't think it was that good. However, now that my brain is no longer consumed with images of ""Elaine from Seinfeld,"" I can actually enjoy this actress in other roles. I'm really glad I gave this a chance because I laughed and laughed and laughed. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed. Very funny!"
5,Great book!,Excellent suspense and plot development. The relationship between Caro and Conor was heartbreaking at times and heart pumping at others. This is a wonderful first book and I will definitely be looking for more from this writer!
4,Entertaining Suspense,"Laurie Breton's first work of romantic suspense successfully emphasizes the suspense of the story, providing an engaging serial killer chiller.FBI agent Carolyn Monahan heads up a task force to catch a serial killer terrorizing Boston, sometimes called Mr. X. However the lead detective on the case Lietenant Conor Rafferty shares a steamy past with Monahan. Putting their attraction aside, they work together to find and apprehend the killer.The suspense builds when the team discovers the killer is targeting Carolyn specifically. She and Rafferty's torrid relationship while trying to dodge a killer does provide some entertainment. However, the steamy scenes slow down and detract from the story as a whole.A wonderful first novel. I look forward to reading more from Ms. Breton."
4,Refreshing collection of new material from old master.,"This CD is thoroughly modern, solid electric blues guitar. Very tight rhythm section, with special emphasis in the mix on the B-3 on a couple of tunes. Good mix of different tempos, feels, sounds. All showcased around the sizzling guitar work of a contemporary master of blues. On this CD, Buddy Guy shows that he still has the killer tone and creative genius to lead the pack. Buddy Guy IS the blues."
1,NO NO NO Buddy. Do not do that to your fans!,"Buddy, everytime I listen to your CDs Slipping in and damn right I feel the blues power. I feel emotions raging in my heart. I feel as if I was saved. I had so much hope for a mature CD in this Heavy love CD, but I got a ROCK CD from a blues master! You can not do that to us Buddy."
1,This Ain't Blues,"Every time I listen to Buddy Guy's amazing recordings at Chess both as a soloist and backing player, then I listen to the garbage he is putting out these days I could just cry. Buddy Guy's blues legacy is going the way Grant Green's did in jazz --into the commercial tank. Green's 50's and early 60's material is stunning and he is just now getting the respect he deserves. There is a reason B.B. King is the ""King of the Blues"" and Buddy Guy is touring with rock n rollers. King is playing his art from the heart and Buddy Guy is playing for the money. No big deal, I understand, it's just tough to swallow. Buddy, after you make your money off the rock crowd, please, please, please, make one last real blues album for the few of us real blues lovers. We would consider it a gift. We'll wait."
4,I'm heavy in love with this one,"This cd always seems to be playing... I have owned this for a couple of years now, and it is awesome blues. The track ""Midnight Train"" featurs Jonny Lang, and they work great together. This is a must have for anyone who likes Buddy.. He kicks it in here on this one!!"
3,blues .....with reserve,"The sound is good... but is this something that buddy has gone through in his life adventure or did someone write these songs for him!!?. Also... the great guitar that only he can play, should be the number one sound...He is a all time great."
3,Has it's Moments,"Heavy Love has it's (few) moments. Understand...I am a HUGE Buddy fan, but this disc leaves a little to be desired. Treasure your copy of Stone Crazy; tell all your friends about Slippin' In; Most important--get out and SEE Buddy play live....but this disk has its place resting on a shelf, although IN your collection."
4,awesome blues recording,"As great as this album is, it is nothing in comparison with one of Buddy's live shows. Buddy is a legend, and with Jonny Lang guest starring on ""Midnight Train"" this is a must have."
2,"if you liked ""Stone Crazy"" this album isn't for you","Buddy really laid back for this album, unfortunately too far back. The groove was there, nice and swampy but buddy wasn't. It's a shame too, after ""Slippin In"" and ""Damn Right I've Got the Blues"", I expected much more. Hopefully this is just a transition album. The only saving grace on this album was ""Had a Bad Night"", and ""Midnight Train""."
2,Not from Buddy,"You could say this is a good Cd if you did not know what Buddy Guy is capable of. He is singing a bunch of soul songs and barely plays a good solo on the album. Go get 'stone crazy', 'slippin in' or 'sweet tea' and dont waste your money here."
3,"Gets the job done, npthing special","Its a great size - I wish it folded up more compactly and that it was more waterproof. We use ours as a water dish when we take the pup on hikes or to restaurant patios, but it doesn't take long for the water to saok thru"
2,"not good,","These bowls are very small, only good for food. I do not recommend them for any dog larger than a house cat. They claim that they are usable for water, they are not. Within 15 seconds water was pooling on the floor around them on first use. If you have a mini/pocket/small dog and just need somethign to carry a days worth of food for them sure they will work. If you are looking for something to use to take your dog camping or hiking find something else, this bowl is pretty much useless."
3,Decent,"The material was pretty cheap and had a weird smell to it. I just think I am going to stick with ziploc bags, which are cheaper and easier to use."
5,Love this book - and the entire Christmas Remembered series!,"The designs in this book are simply amazing. I love the way you can see a full color picture of the finished product at the beginning of the book, and the reference to the charts at the back. I would only recommend this book to an advanced stitcher because of the incredibly detailed charts. In addition, the charts are in color and don't copy over very well into a black and white working copy, so if you are used to having working copy that you can put reminder marks on, this may not be the book for you."
3,Vintage designs,Quality product but the designs are more vintage than I prefer. Wish I could have previewed the designs more before buying.
1,Don't waste your time or money.,We have this phone at my office and it's junk. Reception is awful. I think you could hear better with two Campbell's soup cans and a string. Have a nice day.
5,Williams and Bach go hand in hand,"I always loved John Williams playing Bach. This CD, together with Vol 1, contains Bachs Lute music which is magical. I never heard the very special pieces for Organ and Guitar which were transcribed by Peter Hurford and John Williams. Listen to the ""Wachet Auf"", Cantata 140. Or the Allegro from the Italian Concert. Something special.John Williams is as far as I am concerned the guitar player to get you love Bach. Technically superiour and yet with feeling as well."
1,Lies Lies Lies,Claims it can handle 4 gauge wire I could not even squeeze 9 gauge wire in there without modifying the wire.
3,Upset,Mad because this is what i ordered and didnt get i got the same brand but q-tip ones but the formula is really good and helped the piercing heal
3,Anjelah Johnson DVD,"Simply put, she is hilarious! It was only 10 minutes into the show on Comedy Central and I knew I had to have a copy so I bought two...one for me and one for a friend. My favorite comedians are George Lopez, Freddie Soto, Pablo Francisco, Brian Regan, Chris Rock, Dom Irrera and now Anjelah Johnson. She is a rising star. All of her material is original and she can take ordinary mundane life circumstances and make you fall down laughing. Everything she says is funny but true. You will enjoy this video and watch it over and over again."
3,Few Laughs From Potential Superstar,"Anjelah Johnson delivers a few good laughs in the comedy special. She still needs to work on her comedic timing as some of her bits suffer from lack of activity. But, this talented performer is an excellent mimic and has good material. I expect to see her become more popular as she's attractive and funny. If you like comedy concerts this DVD is worthy of your collection."
3,Tigers Speak with not much to talk about,"I was really upset when I unwrapped the disc and listened for the first time. Mediocre recording quality, disappointing song selections, barely more than 1/2 hour... what was to love. Now after a few listens, I realize that it is better than 80% of what else is out there. I will be very wary of what Ms. Case brings forth in the future.....I feel ripped off, and just was crazy over ""Blacklisted"", hope she puts more effort next time, or it's the heap for her in my book."
4,great live set,this is a great live concert from neko case. every song is good. the only improvement would be to make it a little longer. the sound is good.
4,Great live set!,"i start salivating every time i hear a new recording from Neko case is coming. this is a live set and it's not your typical live album. lots of covers (which is standard fare for her albums, so it seems) and even a few new originals. wow. that's weird to hear a new song on a live album for the first time. but i'm certainly not complaining. my only complaint, is that there is no inbetween song banter included on this recording. anyone who has seen Neko case in concert knows that she talks alot in her sets and her comments are always warm and witty. there is only a small snippet of her dialogue included as the last track here, but it's not enough. oh well...with songs this good, who cares?"
5,Great live album with fun covers.,"I just listened to this album for the first time. It sounds really good for a live album. This CD captures what an amazing live performer Neko Case is, and the unique covers make this release worth buying if you already have her studio albums."
4,"It's short, but she's still amazing","I would agree that this isn't her best album, and I think it's mainly because it's just not as cohesive as her studio efforts. Still, there are some lovely songs (I particularly like ""If You Knew"" and ""Hex""), and there's no getting around the fact that even Neko's lesser efforts are better than 95% of the other singers recording these days. Nonetheless, if you're looking to buy your first Neko Case album, I would actually start with Furnace Room Lullaby; and even though I think this album is a good representation of her live presence, it shouldn't be a substitute for a ticket to one of her shows. Seriously, her voice is absolutely phenomenal, and can't be done justice by something as small as a compact disc!"
5,THE GODDESS!!!,"all i can say is that neko case can do no wrong in my world! and this album showcases her uncanny ablilty to adapt to any style of music, whether it be country, rock, etc. what can i say, I JUST LOVE THIS WOMEN!!!"
4,Neko wuvs tigers - awwwwww,"There are a few songs here that absolutely make me hair stand on end, it's unbelievable. The first track is true perfection and evocative of a great, epic western soundtrack. Then there is the fantastic old time country gospel of This Little Light which is electrifying. As far as sound quality: if anything, it adds to the ""classic"" feel found in vintage live recordings of the 70's. It's good AS IS. What is it about tigers that resonates with Neko? I envision a day when she performs these songs on stage with live tigers going berzerk in cages on each side of the stage. She could walk up to one of them, and the tiger would flash his paw through the bars, angry that he/she is being subjected to the loud noise, the audience. She could even bring a stool and sit next to the caged feline and serenade it."
3,Don't really get it,"I read so many positive reviews of this CD and Neko Case in general, I said I got to check it out. She does have a good voice, but she seems to sing the same note all the time. And the songwriting doesn't inspire me that much. One last thing...If I can't understand the lyrics, what's the point. I'm sticking to Alison Krauss...not to compare or anything..."
2,800 watt inverter,"This inverter sort of meets it's specifications. However I had trouble with getting it to run inductive loads. The over current protection circuit is too sensitive and it would trip if I tried to fun my little 130 watt refrigerator or an electric drill. On non inductive loads like electronics, it worked fine, but some times it makes different buzzing sounds. For the price it is a good value as long as you are not running motorized equipment off of it."
3,good but for dummies,"This is a great book the only reason for low stars is that it didnt tell me anything that you couldnt find out easily by looking at one or maybe even two simple websites about fibro. If you know absolutely nothing then get it or get it for friends and family of someone who has it, it is very good and easy to read it is definelty for dummies on the subject."
4,Fibromyalgia for Dummies,This book is very easy to read and is very informative...it helped me a lot
3,Easy Reading,"This book really didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know....through the internet and my doctors. It was all correct reading, just never saved me from all the pain I have gone through for the past seven years! Only exercise, injections, and pain meds have saved me!"
2,fibromyalgia for dummies,well i knew the book was going to be used but i was a little disappointed because coffee had been spilled on book and it looked like no attempts were made to clean it up at all
2,Falls short of real and useful information.,"I think this book fails to supply the most important information to those with fibromyalgia. It makes the dissorder seem so mysterious, when it is not. Much is known about FM that this book skims over or doesn't mention. Sleep is the major component to FM, because of a deficiency of serotonin, preventing us from getting delta sleep, the restorative sleep that revitalizes energy, and heals/relaxes muscles. Check out ""Fibromyalgia"" by Daniel J. Wallace. That does a much better job."
5,Very Informative,"My boyfriend has Fibromyalgia. I have done alot of research online, but this book provided so much more. It had so many more possibilities that I hadn't yet thought of to look up. As I'm sure you're aware, if you can get rid of just one symptom of the disability, then maybe it can help your loved one live a bit of a more happy life. It gave us alot of information that we looked into and I feel that we have helped ease some of his pain, even just a tiny bit. Also, since most of our families don't understand fully what fibromyalgia is, it was helpful to have them read the book so that the little things that we all do out of love, but that really stress out the fibromyalgia sufferer, aren't done as often."
4,Quality Garden Torch,Very happy with these torches. Definitely a cut above those cheap tiki torches you see everywhere. Anticipate years of service from them.
1,"Cover may change, Contents still 20 years old!!","This book was a total waste of money! The only difference in the editions are the covers. Save your money, buy the oldest edition, if you want a book that has a very limited amount of cats in it. The majority of the book is taken up by stories, boring!!! If the cover implies, ""Cat Collectibles"", that's what I expect. Not so much here, the prices are out of date and listed in the back of the book. I believe the author had a family member photograph her meager collection, wrote up some information about each piece, and then cobbled together this book. Now, every few years, she redesigns a new cover and presents it as new. Save your money, nothing to see here."
5,"Highly informative, yet as readable as a good novel.","As one of Roger's hellerwork clients I must admit a certain degree of bias, and I was already convinced that he knew what he was talking about. I ordered the book as soon as it was published in the UK as I hoped it would suggest ways in which I could maintain the benefits from hellerwork. I was however very pleasantly surprised as to how readable it was - I started reading it on the train and nearly missed my stop! And my fellow passengers probably thought me very strange for smiling and chuckling over a work of non-fiction! Roger has successfully found a balance between the light hearted and the serious - the humour and the trivia keep your attention, and the information and sound advice make you think. And whats more when you do think about it, everything he says makes sense - it will make you see the way you do things in a whole new light."
5,Had no idea how much my dog would like this.,"Make sure you mix this stuff properly with other things. If you have dogs, they may take to thinking something tasty is buried there."
4,Quirky night of fun,"Hooked on the show from the first time we watched on PBS , had to get set to watch it from beginning . Love it."
5,What a Bargain,"Looking forward to viewing the series. I can't speak to the quality of the CDs, but have no reason to suspect that they won't operate as they should."
1,Doc Martin series 1-4,"Wow, what a disappointment. This item was listed as new on website but when I received order, packing slip says ""LIKE NEW"".If its not new, isn't it used. I paid full price for what I thought was new only to receive used. And to add insult to injury, now 2 DVDs in the series won't play. I DO NOT recommend this site! So now I have to try and get a refund, box up and ship back and order Doc Martin Series 1-4 from another site. BIG disappointment."
4,Doc Martin: Collection - Series 1-4,"I really enjoyed the series, but was offended by episodes that were vulgar (Aunt Joan having sex on the kitchen table, and the lady who ""infected"" the men in her life by the hormones she was taking. I got rid of those DVD's!) I probably would NOT have ordered these if I had previously seen these episodes!"
5,Gift for Mother,My mother-in-law really enjoys this quirky show. The product was in excellent condition and a great price for series 1-4 compared to purchasing individual seasons.
5,Great show!,"We love this show- very funny, very creative. We started watching on Netflix, but decided to buy the disks for ourselves. It's still in production; waiting to see the next installment."
5,Doc Martin series 1 - 4,"Both my husband and I were absolutely mesmerized and captivated with this entire series. Each evening we could hardly wait to spend our evening watching Doc Martin. We just found out that the latest series will be released in late August 2011, which we will snap up immediately!!!!!! We will surely miss some of the characters that we so enjoyed, ""Aunt Joan"", ""Mark the policeman"", and ""Pauline the receptionist"". Well done by all of the characters and cast. By the way, what ever happened to the shaggy dog? Please bring him back as well as the above named characters!!!!!! Thank you so very much for great actors, great acting, and fun - sometimes very serious stories, the writing could not be better!!!! Absolutely refreshing!!!!!! Please keep going, we are addicted!!!!!!JFS - Southern California USA"
1,"great series, didn't know we were buying rip offs though","We love the Doc Martin series and we bought what we thought were used originals. Nope! they were crappy rip off reproductions. The CDs were mislabeled so we watched the end of one of the series before the beginning. (confusing) The quality was terrible and would constantly skip chapters, we had to manually enter each chapter number when it started skipping.CAN'T STAND PIRATING THIEVES THAT RIP OFF Music, Videos, etc. Feel like we were had."
1,Disappointed ...,"I was in my local library one day checking out the DVDs. A woman, probably in her late 50's noticed I had picked up Downton Abbey, and said, ""You ought to see Doc Martin. If you like Downton Abbey, you'll love Doc Martin."" I took the recommendation and splurged on this 9-disc set. I don't care for it. I feel bad for the English if this is the kind of crap they're assaulted by on their tellys. Simply put, it's debased, and watching it is debasing."
1,BORING!! - NOT WORTH IT!,"This has got to be the most stupid and boring series i've every watched, I couldn't even make it past the first season it was so stupid. I have no idea why it's getting good ratings. I'm an avid British comedy, mystery etc. fan and this series is a pure waste of time!"
5,Doc Martin series 1-4,This is series is so funny that I laugh so hard I need a tissue. I love the characters and story lines. I want to live in the village of Portwenn. I depressed watch this to up lift your mood.
5,What's Not to Love about Doc Martin,"With anticipation I waited for the first 4 seasons of Doc Martin, having found this Gem of a Show on PBS this year. It is now a Sunday night staple in my house. This is a great series to own and share with friends. Doc Martin is a comedy drama at it's best!"
3,One series was NOT new,These were all NEw except for series 4; they had been previousl viewed or copied. I don't like being cheated.
5,Kudos to Doc Martin: Collection Series 1-4,Loved the Doc Martin: Collection Series 1-4. Amazon sold the collection at a much better price than other venues. I plan to purchase the first movie as a Christmas gift for my husband. I totally recommend this series for drama and humor. Great gift!
2,Scratched Disc,"One of the discs is badly scratched, and broken plastic that holds the disc in place is broken. Love the series however."
5,Doc Martin Series,"This English series is excellent in every way - drama,comedy, acting etc. You will spend many a happy hour enjoying this series of programs."
5,One of the great British comedy series,A great value collection of all four series of this great British show - we watch an episode each evening and thoroughly enjoy each one.
2,Half-a-loaf warning,"The first two seasons are most of what the other reviewers say they are, with a charming plot line and wonderfully quirky characters you can't help but love and care about. Four stars for the (understandable) lack of a complete narrative arc.Then the original writer (Minghella?) is replaced by a series of vastly inferior writers and the plot line is replaced with a series of decreasingly compelling and decreasingly funny cliches. The final-episode deus ex machina only makes the growing fecklessness of the last two seasons the more dispiriting.Try to watch season 3 before you buy it."
4,Doc Martin Series,"This is a four series, 8 disk, tale of a surgeon who, because of his hemophobia, moves to a small town and serves as their GP.It is set in a real village in Cornwall and the scenery is great. It makes you want to go there and see it for yourself, and since this series was produced, many people have gone there to see it in person.Doc Martin is serious, unpredictable and delightful. His whole involvement with the village folk is believeable and funny.This is just one of many great British series and I thoroughly enjoy them. Kudos to the BBC."
3,"Content 5 stars, DVD presentation 1 star","I've enjoyed the series on my local PBS station, so I bought the series. The HUGE drawback is that everytime you start to watch a DVD, it takes several minutes of mandatory watching of ads and previews before you can select a menu. That sucks."
4,"Superb TV show, minimal DVD set","""Doc Martin"" is one of the funniest, most intelligent, and most poignant shows on television.The DVD set is merely adequate. The most glaring omission is the lack of an episode guide to tell you which episodes are on which DVDs. There are also no special features, though that's more of a ""nice to have"" item than the episode guide, whose lack is a significant inconvenience. As with many DVD sets, the DVD cases are cheap and flimsy.Five stars for the show, averaged with three stars for the DVD set, gives an overall rating of four stars."
5,FABULOUS!!!!!,"One of my best purchases! Characters are so well developed and story lines are so unique and well written. Most Americans I know haven't a clue that there are so many fantastic British shows. Drama, comedy and romance in one show, Doc Martin. Just love it! Great price and quick delivery."
1,complete hack,"Thomas Joseph is the king of recycled clues and answers. If, like me, your daily paper carries his crossword puzzles, you may be familiar with the fact that you are guaranteed to see at least three recycled answers within a one week period in his crosswords. So if you're looking for an easy crossword puzzle book this is an okay choice, but if you want any challenge at all, avoid Joseph like the plague. Thomas Joseph gets absolutely no points for creativity or imagination."
5,"A must for any ""Wanna-Be"" P.I.","I read this book in one sitting and laughed most of the way. The only improvement would have been to include more stories. There are eight million stories in the naked city and these are just a few. If you want some insite on what it's like to be a cop in the ""Big Apple"" or a P.I., this is the book to read."
1,Jimmy the Wags Lives On in Amazon Review-Land Still?,"It wasn't that good a read the first time and, years later after its publication, nothing in the world really can ever keep pace-written or otherwise-with Joe Pesci's performance in Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas."" Enough said."
3,Wags is a character straight out of central casting...,"Wags is character alright and fundamentally decent, if a bit flawed, man. His story reads like a novel or comedic film. I'm not quite sure where the truth was stretched, but his honest delivery is well worth the (very fast) read. He tells some wild stories--some are hilarious--some violent--some just out there (the one handed, parrot carrying, heiress). But, the tone works and the the world of the PI is exposed as it never was on Magnum PI."
2,Watch Band Looks Great But Smells,The watchband looks great has worn well but after sweating with it on began to smell. I tried washing it with soap and drying it but the smell did not go away.
2,Went right through it,I had to change the pond water 3 times as I used up this money. It slowed the algae slightly but not good enough. I wish I had that $ back.
3,Nice for hiding,This really looks like a boulder from a distance but is actually a lot smaller than I thought measurements are correct technically but looks small for my purpose
2,Not very useful,I found the descriptions of the exercises occasionally confusing.I found many of the diagrams confusing.I found very little having to do with Tai Chi or qigong.I don't recommend this book.
5,Steve Hofstetter nailed it.,"Most college humorists crack jokes about such tired subjects as the bad cafeteria food, small living spaces, and big classes. Funny, sure, but reading it is a lot like having a stand-up comedian joke about bad airline food and how he or she can't program their VCR.In contrast, Steve Hofstetter nailed the college experience to a tee. Everything from classes and parents to hook-ups and parties are discussed in a hilarious (and slightly sarcastic) manner, with unbelievable, undeniable accuracy. Student Body Shots is a must-read for college students and anyone else who fondly remembers the experience."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"Don't waste your time or money reading this book. You know those text books you bought freshman year that you only took one important line off of for every 3 pages you read...well this book has one funny line for every 3 pages. If you truly want something that will make you bust up go get Karo's book, either of them."
1,are you serious???,"i was SHOCKED to see that not only did people read and review this book, but that they actually seemed to enjoy it. i received ""Student Body Shots"" as a graduation present...socks or any number of normally unwanted gifts would have been preferable to this piece of crap. In short, there is nothing funny about stating the blatantly obvious. Steve, tell your friends to stop writing reviews. The only reason I am giving this book one star is because there was no ""zero star"" option."
3,Vidal Sasson V5505 1875W Turbo Dryer,Okay. I have had many hair driers throughout the years. This one is just ok. It does not have enough power to quickly dry my extremely curly hair. I would have preferred one with more power.
1,Broke after 3 months,"I had one of these for a few years and loved it so when it died, I wanted to replace it with the same thing. We bought it late December and it already died. It blows air but is no longer hot. We are outside of the 30 day return window and there doesn't seem to be a product guarantee so unfortunately I think we are out of luck. Very disappointed."
2,Diffuser attachment isn't any good.,"The dryer works well, but the diffuser hardly diffuses the hair at all. The air still comes through almost directly which defeats the purpose of it. I ended up returning it."
5,Dries fast,"First hair dryer I have purchased in at least 15 years. What a difference in drying time, came with attachments and fits easily in the same storage area I had for my last hairdryer. Totally happy!"
1,Quit working within 1 month.,"I purchased this item knowing that my current hair dryer was on it's last legs. I wish I had started using it immediately. My dryer finally went out and I started using this product. It did not last but two weeks before it burned out. Of course, that was past it's return date. So now I am stuck paying for a product that did not work. Between Amazon's return policy and the poor quality of this product, I will think again before I purchase anything electrical from Amazon."
4,Wonderful! A must buy!,"Great hair dryer!! It works great on my fine, thin hair. I even bought a few extra in case one breaks! LOVE IT! Only gave 4 stars because it is a bit loud when on the high setting."
3,Normal Dryer,"This dryer is lightweight and easy to handle. It worked great for a year then stopped working. Now it will only blow cold air so it takes a LONG time to get my hair dry (and my hair is pretty thin). The attachment pops of easily if you're not careful and if you have it on the hottest setting it's too hot to put back on without hurting your hands. All in all it's a very good, normal dryer. I just wished it would've lasted longer."
2,Gone with little wind,"I purchased this dryer with the intention that it would be similar to the Vidal Sassoon dryer I had years ago. Unfortunately, like many other products today, the quality has gone down. This is cheaply made and quite puny! I returned mine after one use."
4,good dryer but,I bought this several years ago and its held up to the test of time. Works well on my daughter's thin hair (15mins tops)but I have very thick hair( I can wrap a pony tail 2 times around my hair my pony tail is prob about 2 inches thick accross) and very long hair( its down past my butt) my old dryer took a total of an hour and a half on full blast to dry my hair and didn't shut off (dog chewed through the cord in quite a few spots and had to get a replacement )this one takes me 2 and a half hours(not including the frequent breaks) to dry my hair on full blast and I have to stop every 20mins because it gets too hot and shuts off. Over all a good hair dryer but I wouldn't reccomend to someone with very thick hair.
1,worst hair dryer ever!,"worst hair dryer ever! no power. even when it's on HIGH, it's barely powerful enough to make my hair move. i might as well get someone to put there mouth close to my head and blow. wish i still had the box, i'd send it right back. what a rip off. they have the nerve to use the word ""turbo"" in the name, what a joke."
1,TERRIBLE DRYER -- ONLY BLOWS COLD AIR,"I'd like to give this blow dryer 0 stars - because it is worthless. Only blows cold air. Unfortunately, by the time I actually took it out to use it, my return window had expired so I'm stuck with it. DO NOT BUY"
3,vidal hair dryer,"I bought this product several months ago and the blow dryer quit working; It wasn't even a year old. I bought another one because I'm so use to it, but if breaks within a year, I'm sending it back to Amazon in pieces!!!Not a happy camper when I have to buy 2 in one year because they break so fast."
3,Railway Man,The first third was boring unless you really like trains. The second third was horrifying unless you like reading about people being tortured. The final third redeemed the first two thirds.
1,Not really torture,"Mr. Lomax seems to be a nice gentleman that suffered through WW2, but torture, not really. From his book, he never spent even one day working on the Burma Railroad. Every time he was moved from camp to camp, it was by truck. He was fed and had medical attention after he was beaten for having a forbidden radio and map.I really found the book not worth reading, unless you want to read about a WW2 radio operator, not a combat soldier, talk about suffering, somewhat, through the war."
4,the railway man,this book gave a heartfelt insight as to what these heros had to go through in order for people of all nations including Japan to realize that wars just dont accomplish anything but pain in so many ways .
5,Railway Man,Beautifully written and moving to the last word! It leaves you with hope. Eric Lomax passed away recently and this book was mentioned in his obituary. The words Brutality and Forgiveness in the same sentence made me curious to read it.
2,very dissapointed in the patterns,"The patternson this rolling pin were not what I expected. I guess I should have read the reviews before ordering. My kids will have fun with it, but I'll be geting a different pin next year"
3,the barrel isn't milled round,The pin tapers to one end so I don't get the full range of imprints. I used the pin twice before I realized the problem. (my first time at making springerles) I dont believe in returning items once used.
3,so-so quality,I always wanted this springerle rolling pin. I do not like the material it is made from (compared to other pins available) There is imperfections in the wood.
2,Not adequate for my expectations,You can mass produce Springerle cookies but the definition of them is not good.Dislike: Carvings are too shallow resulting in blurry cookie designs.I was used to my mom's 50 + year old Springerle roller which had much better definition. I went to flat molds.
1,Junk,Product was shoddy and substandard. Light string wire insulation cracked during off-season storage and fell off when handled this past X-mas season. This would have been only the second usage.
3,no information,"The cd in itself is ok, good performances throughout but there is not a single hint about who plays what and how long. You know from the cover that Schippers, Ormandy and other good conductors are there but this is about everything you get. Really a pity because the selection is good and interesting(not the usual ""famous"" things you heard manhandled million times) and well performed throughout.Performances 5 stars, information 1 star, averaged out at 3 then."
2,Nice but defective,"I bought this album to get the Donna Diana overture that was the theme music for Captain Yukon of the Mounties TV show long ago. The performances are fine, but two tracks on the album (Orpheus and one other) are defective with repetitive clicking noises."
5,WOW!,"I work at an elementary school and these are the vacuums we use. THEY ARE AMAZING. They suck up anything! whole crayons, pencils, paperclips, tissues, dirtclods, pennys, paper pieces, ect. The hose on the side is an awesome feature. Ours have a 3 foot solid hose extendor on them so whenever there is a piece of paper behind a desk or something, we just pull it out of the holder, suck it up, and put it right back. No assembling and then un-assembling. Another cool thing is that if you do suck up something too big and it plugs, It is super easy to take apart. It requires bags which I dont mind at all. There are no filters to plug up. And the crayons and stuff go directly into the bag. I use this vacuum around 3 hrs a night 5 nights a week. I love this vacuum and wish I had the $$$ to buy one!!!"
5,amazing,this pastry/pizze dough rolling pin is great! i got it for my mom for an early mothers day gift and she absolutly loves it!
1,"splinters, unfinished wood","The wood used for the roller is very soft, unfinished, and has splinters coming off all over it. I would never roll pastry or dough with something that would leave splinters. I am trying to sand it down but I don't think I'm going to be able to stop it happening some more. Shame, it's a stylish product and has potential to be very useful."
1,poor quality untreated wood,"I bought this so we could roll out smaller pastries and pizza dough. It did the job well enough, but after ONE wash the wood was splintering on both ends and the handle. The wood was obviously untreated in any form to make it appropriate for a rolling pin. or else it wouldn't have splintered at all. We tried to sand it back down and treat it properly but it just continued to splinter no mater what. So my wife finaly just threw it away and is now shopping for a better one."
2,"cheap metal, designed to fail","i was very happy with this roller, but it only lasted about a month. i used it for pizza and tortillas about 3 times a week. the metal does not go all the way through but is instead plugs with spades to prevent it from turning. mine actually broke off at one of the metal plugs (just like the other reviewer). i always hand washed and never soaked and probably never even got the handle wet since i would scrub off the roller. if it wouldn't have broken at the handle these plugs would have worked their way loose i'm guessing after about a year (there is already some play on the small side). if the metal was a little higher quality and went all the way through the wood this would last a lifetime, but instead lasts for about 15 uses. i'm guessing all of the other reviewers either use it very occasionally or have not owned it for long."
1,Pot metal didn't hold up... Skip this one and opt for a different brand.,"This design is great for making pizza crusts or rolling out dough for other items. I bake all of our bread products and loved using this but, it broke after not even a year of use. The metal just didn't hold up, the whole end broke off, I would have expected more from NorPro and bought the brand name thinking it would be better quality- not true.I just ordered a new one of a slightly different design, hopefully the metal will hold up on this one."
3,Okay for tight spaces but not a replacement for a real rolling pin,"I bought this to roll out doughs inside of the pan, which is required for certain applications. It works okay, but is sticky and is also difficult to clean. This item is good for tight spaces, but stick with a good old fashioned French rolling pin for real pastry work."
2,Cheap and Silly,"You get what you pay for with this item, its ok, but really not very well made or helpful with pizza making!"
5,pizza roller,this is the greatest little roller for rolling pizza dough out. Every time it rolls it even and smooth
3,Not really what I needed for Pizza making,"I got carried away buying all the stuff I thought I would need to make my first Pizzas at home. This seemed like a novel item I might use. Actually, a mediun rollikg pin was the more correct item for rolling out the Pizza dough. This might be more useful making pastries, or something smaller than a Pizza. But for Pizzas, it's rather tedious to use."
1,This is the worst book I have ever read!!!!!,"This is not one of the worst books I have ever read, it is the worst book I have ever read. I did not even finish it. It was trite and long. It was not even realistic. The dialogue was unoriginal and boring.While I was happy that Mr. Roy wrote and published a novel, I would not recommend anyone spending full price for this novel. The beginning started off promising, but fell off soon after."
4,Romantic and Hilarious!,"This novel is quite romantic and gives hope to those of us who still believe in forever. Kirby Roy uses no fancy drama, language or title to share a love story between two real people. He keeps it real and entertaining.Candace and Derrick are two simple people who meet and open their thoughts to the reader while opening their hearts and mouths to one another. It's quite funny how the author lets us know the wild and crazy thoughts that each character has, and it is creative how their words are delivered with great sensitivity. The friends are real, and their situations are real. The lovers are also real in their thoughts, feelings, and actions.This is an enjoyable and easy read... It's good to read a sweet love letter/story that has a happy ending!"
4,Big Bird's a Hit!,"My 18-month old daughter has enjoyed this book for about 6 months now. It shows Big Bird having a great time doing different activities, such as singing, rollerskating, reading, etc... with some of his friends from Sesame Street. Plus, his face is a stuffed toy on the front cover of the book! One problem that we had with this board book was that my daughter loved the face part so much that she pulled the front cover off of the book. I hope your child enjoys it just as much!"
2,"Great content, but not so sturdy","I bought this book for my two-year-old, who is obsessed with Big Bird. The first time she opened it, the spine ""cracked"" on the inside. This has never happened with any of her other board books, which she has been handling herself for well over a year. My daughter and I both love the story, but I am disappointed in how flimsy the book itself is."
5,"A thoughtful, concise, compelling read.","In reviewing this particular book, it's hard to figure where to begin, the book is so well-written and informative. If the subject interests you, this book is the one you want to read and keep on a shelf for future reference. Payne's writing style is seductive, and never bores. His insight into where societies usually go wrong is the best I have ever seen. But more importantly, this book is not just a criticism of welfare spending; it is a thoughtful, concise and compelling explanation of what needs to be done to save the system and help those who need our assistance most. I cannot recommend it enough, except to say, it's books such as this which make book buying so worthwhile. Thank you, Mr. Payne for your insight, and for taking the time to do it right."
3,A mixed bag for me,"This product looks good and fits my threaded 1"" fork just fine. It's secure and sturdy, and the quill bolt is nice and strong.However, it creaks annoyingly and loudly. If I loosen the quill bolt and tighten it back, the creaking goes away for an hour, but then it creeps back. I've tried lubricating the whole thing, but no luck. I'm shopping for another brand now."
3,will work,"It does work but the bolt is sitting down inside, not on the top with a cover plate, the tube so it looks strange. To make work you need a longer bolt and new cap (cover plate)."
1,a lie...how about a one word review,"a lie, a perversion of the truth, and propoganda by a biased person with deep misunderstanding and hate for the truth"
1,"A work of biased research, and incomplete information","If you are looking for a true understanding about women's rights in Islam, do NOT read this book. It is equitable to saying that to read a true account of Western society, read the history of the Nazi's. The experiences of one person, from one perspective, are never enough to give anyone a full understanding of what an entire system works. Islam is a complete way of life, and it's laws regarding the rights, responsibilities and relations between men and women come from a clear wisdom of dealing with real social problems. For further explanations, and a clearer understanding, I implore you to research the matter further. There are many good websites on the internet. One can be found off of the Islam homepage on Yahoo. It is called Iman Al-Muminah, and God willing, it will give you a better understanding of the real situation."
1,A biased book painting a very derogagatory picture of women,"In a patriarcjal society the Quran is interperted to be advantageous to those in power (namely the men) and that is what the author has done. Islam not granted women the status of a citizen when less enlightened parts of the world beleived that women were not 'people' but also gave them the right to ask for a divorce, own property and inherit assests. The author presents a very biased view of the role of women stemming from poor interpetation of the true meaning behind many of the practiecs of the religion. There are better books that paint a more balanced role of women in Islam, especially those written by women."
1,Totally misleading!,"This book misleads the reader from the real facts. I would assume the reader doesn't really understand the true teaching of Islam in this respect (Women'n rights). I wanted to rate the book as 0 star, but 1 is the lowest. I have to go with 1 then! I would recommend you not selling this book, as a request from a sensitive reader, and I believe there are millions more who feel the same way about this book!"
1,This book should be used as toillet paper,"That is the only use for this book, how could someone with no knowldge about a subjet then decide to write a book on it...there is no religion on earth that respect woman the same or even comes close to the law of ISLAM"
1,"Lies, Lies, Lies","This book is full of lies about Islam and prophet Muhammed (pbuh). The author has twisted the meaning of the Islam horribly in an attempt to misguide people from the truth. I would give this book 0 stars if I could. Islam demands kindness and respect for women, please read about womans rights in Islam from a reliable Muslim author/scholar."
1,This is book deserves NO stars!,"This book portrays Islam and the Prophet Mohammed (Peace be upon him) as barbaric. This could not be further than the truth.Islam is the first religion to give women the right to vote, the right to own property, the right to inheritance.Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.""Heaven lies at the feet of the mother""May Almighty Allah defeat the enemies of the Prophet Muhammed (S.A.W) and his followers"
1,o star rating: a total misconception regarding women in isla,a negative understanding of the koran and the sayings of our beloved Nabi Mohammed SAW regarding women in Islam.Lets show more respect to the truth and practices of Islam
4,Women ARE still being sexually repressed in Islam,"This book really hits the point.The point of ""women in Islam"" is not so much whether or not women are allowed to become doctors etc. However there is a big disparity in Islam as soon as human sexuality is concerned: Whereas an unmarried muslim male can have as much premarital sex as he likes, a muslim woman is strictly obliged to preserve her virginity to ""keep the honor of the family"". If she does not do so, she must expect to be killed by her own family (in order to re-install the ""honor of the family""). And those are facts proven by evidence.So as long is there is no sexual equality between the sexes, there is no equality between the sexes at all."
1,Curse from Satan - 1000 times worse than Rushdi,"An ananymous person (was he ashamed?) has given me this book. But this is an act of hate. This book is the most horrible compilation of the most awful blasphemies and lies one could ever utter against the Prophet, peace be on him, and on Allah, blessed be His name. This book is a curse of Satan to those who read it, much worse than Rusdi's book. As soon as I realized what this book is cursed (and Helmat is cursed also), I tear it apart and have burned the pieces. I need purification from this curse and the blessing of Allah. That such a book and others come from America really show that this nation is the most cursed, evil and satanic country in the world, the Big Satan, truly. If you live in this cursed place like me, pray Allah, blessed be His name, that you may not come across such cursed satanic books as this one."
1,Not accurate at all,"I am a graduate student doing research on the veil/hijab. This book is an awful treatment of Muslim traditions and is based on the authors opinions rather then on historical facts. It is scary that such a work is out there, it only perpetuates the stereotypes that need to be removed in order for Westerners to truly understand Islam. This book does not reflect Muslim beliefs at all."
1,Sterotypical,"The veil is still seen as an oppression in the west,particularlyin America.For both sexes there is modesty.What America focuseson is the lifestyle of Saudi women but not even they have allthe same experience.When I ask some friends about Islam theiranswers seem to be ""women aren't allowed to drive""This is not in the Quran.Many Americans don't even know how the countriesin the middle east vary tremedously.No country in the middle east is truly under Islamic Law.There is a need by some in thewest to use the women as a battle cry against Islam so theyperpetuate the sterotypes which get many Americans a bit angry."
5,Koran made Muslims do bad things,"This book exposes the verses from the Koran and Islamic traditions that caused muslims worldwide to do bad and inhuman things. Islam as stated in the Koran identified unbelief as the number one enemy. Therefore all non-muslims especially those from non-abrahamic faiths are enemys of Islam and Allah. The acts of terror by militant muslims worldwide today are very much done in accordance to the hadith (Islamic tradition) and the teachings in the Koran despite a few contradictions. It's sad that the secular west buys in to Islamic Apologist's bogus claim.The only flaw I see in the book is that the author neglected to compare Islam with Far-eastern religion like Zen, Tao, which makes a well balanced spiritual life meningful unlike abrahamic faiths."
3,recommend w/ reservations,"Interesting, but I question the scholarship to a degree. It is difficult to find an unbiased reflection on women,on Islam, and esp. on the Prophet and the wars of conquest. This is no exception, but I would agree that the pre-Islamic civ. appears to have had more freedoms for women- a public life, dress that expressed individuality , etc. still the man had ownership of his family and could kill unwanted children. ie, like most things- change makes some things better, some things worse. More freedoms doesn't necessarily translate into more rights.I don't doubt as victors write the history, tribal genocides were carried out but are whitewashed as in all sacred religious history (note judeo-xtn OT wars of the Israelites against those living in land 'God gave to them') Its simply difficult to find texts that can examine M. & Islam without either vilifying or treating as sacred- a believer who can call the Prophet a human who made mistakes."
1,Listen up!,"To comment on the last person's comment's, I would like to say that Muslim women are individuals of their own in Islamic Law. They have the right to an education, to own and sell property of their own, consent at marriage, right to divorce, child custody, etc. Would these rights be given to someone who can't (or considered) to not think on their own? One can see that easily in Islamic hadeeths (tradition of the prophet). Women had their own opinions and voiced them publicly. They were in the front lines of battle, they were even the teachers of men (the wives of the prophet). In fact, a huge chunk of the Islamic hadeeths were transmitted by women and none were questioned by the early Islamic scholars. I am truly disapointed that society still thinks Muslim women are considered inferior and this book is a good indicator of that."
4,Excellent book on Strategic Management,"This book is very excellent for being comprehensive and well organized. It is also written in very lucid language but professional, which made it easy for the reader to go through the book and understand the ideas of the authors. This book helps in building a visionary style of thinking for the leaders to enable them to cop with the challenges of the 21st century. It covers many aspects of strategic management like finance, marketing, purchasing, and planning organization, human resources and non-business strategic management.The authors support their ideas by case studies. In fact they incorporated 19 case studies in the text that make it very practical and unique."
4,Great introduction to web services with ASP.NET,"I recently needed to quickly get ""up to speed"" on creating and using web services with ASP.NET. Although I was already very familiar with XML, SOAP, WSDL, etc., I found the explanations of how web services work to be very useful and understandable.I also found that the sample code enabled me to easily create my own web services using ASP.NET. I appreciated that both VB and C# were included in the examples and discussions.Overall, I found this to be a very practical, as well as understandable, introduction to ASP.NET and web services."
4,Great overall picture of xml web services with .net,"Very easy to read, good all-around range of information regarding .net Web services. I am glad I picked this book up because it pertains specifically to web services in the new .NET environment."
4,"LPN LVN Pre-entrance Exam, 2nd edition","It is a helpfull book that provide all the information that a student need to remember many aspects of knowledge in a easy way, and guide the student to succeed in the entrance exams"
1,Should women be dominated by men??!!,"This book teaches women to be submissive to their husbands, and not to pursue any self-fulfillment outside of the home. If you are a woman who dares to be anything other than a fully submissive housewife, then this book is not for you. Women have every right to pursue the same goals and ambitions as men. You don't need any man (or in this case, a dominated woman) to tell you otherwise. This book is a waste of your time."
2,Not Demereye quality that I expect,"I received this today and knew within a minute of opening it that I would be returning it. The handle seems too lightweight and flimsy. The handles may be welded but they are riveted as well and you can see the rivet impressions on the inside of the pain. I hate that. In addition, there's a small crack where the handles meet the sides of the pan. Food and liquid can very easily get in to this space. For $250+ this wasn't acceptable to me at all so it's going back."
2,"Love heals all wounds, but only if applied","Mitch Sayer and Piper Wynne meet on a plane and he later finds a crumpled letter on the plane's floor which affects him to the degree that he feels he must find out who wrote it. He later discovers that he and Piper share the same city and work near each other, so this leads to a few dates for them both. Piper is running from her past and a mistake she can't forgive herself for, and Mitch's growing attraction to her causes her to feel threatened.I liked Mitch as a character, but Piper behaved, for the most part, like an idiot. There's feeling guilty for what you did, and then there's 'I don't deserve to live' level drama. Piper's behavior is grossly unrealistic and downright silly at times. There are some decent supporting characters, including a married couple who befriend Piper. However, Piper's family includes kids named ""Thai"" and ""Asia"" (really?). It's not a truly bad book, but it's a mediocre romance at best."
5,Love's healing touch,"'While hurrying to catch a plane, widowed lawyer Mitch Sayer finds a single page from a handwritten letter, a letter offering forgiveness to an unknown recipient. But thoughts of its possible owner flee his mind when he meets his attractive seatmate, Piper Wynne.Guilt has driven Piper from her family, and her new job as an insurance investigator offers the prospect of starting over. Mitch's discovery of her letter and his quest for its addressee make it difficult to continue to hide her past, especially as their new friendship deepens. Will Mitch's love for Piper truly heal her heart?'"
4,Here is a book to abash the hopeful and delight the cynical.,"Raymon F. Adams for many years has has collected books about the Wild West badmen and studied the contents of these books. ""Never would I have believed,"" he writes, ""that so much false, inaccurate, and garbled history could have found its way into print."" This book is where you should start if you wish to sort the harsh facts from titillative fancy."
4,Good But Still Lacking,"True, this collection does include many of their top hits, but it aslo leaves off some of their early hits & other great songs. If you're looking for the ultimate Paul Revere & The Raiders collection, get ""The Legend Of Paul revere & The Raiders"" dual CD set instead. This collection features their roots & early hits, ""Beatnick Sticks"" and ""Like Long Hair."" Both of these were instrumental hits, before the band decided to become a vocal band. It also contains their version of ""Louis, Louie,"" a song they recorded before The Kingsmen (which Columbia Records did not promote, thinking rock was a passing fancy), along with ""Louie-Go Home."" The dual CD set contains a whopping 55 songs, including ""SS 396"" and ""Judge GTO Breakaway,"" both comersials they recorded. If you're seeking a collection that feature a wider variety of their sound, get ""The Legend of Paul Revere & The Raiders"" instead."
3,Nice collection!,"As I mentioned in other reviews, I'm not into the greatest hits thing. I bought this cd because I love one of their songs (Cherokee People). I could not find the original album with that song anywhere else. This compilation is just OK."
5,TWO QUESTIONS,Are all the songs in stereo and do the liner notes give the recording dates of each song?Please feel free to email me at Shawboy@Webtv.net
5,Paul Revere & the Raiders - Anthology CD,Definitive collection of all the hits of Paul Revere and the Raiders.
2,disappointing,"As several other reviewers have noted, the actual information about colour is superficial. There are a variety of striking photos, although several I thought seemed familiar to me. The photos are what ""makes"" the book. Much of the text is basically like a stream of consciousness poem listing out words or phrases associated with the colour on the page. It's not intriguing, it's unhelpful. The ""colour quiz"" consists of a couple of pages of words. You are supposed to figure out the words you want to colour your room/house with, and then there's a key that tells you the colour. I didn't find that too helpful. If you already know absolutely basics, for instance that blue is meant to be soothing, red is energizing, purple is mystical or sensual, then this isn't the book for you. The information is very limited."
1,Why Did Greenberg Allow for Fake Reviewers?,"As the review Muffin has reported and has been confirmed, Lisa Goodnight and Lee Rademacher faked their affiliation and their occupation to provide a positive review of this book.I do not understand why the author, or Bert Rockman Head of Political Science at Purdue University, would have allowed this?"
5,Sarah McLachlan is a music goddess,"This c.d., as with the rest of Sarah's stuff is wonderful. Her music is beautiful and speaks to the listener in a profound way...at least that's the way I see it : )"
4,Surfacing... un album un peu trop correct....,"On dirait que les 4 années que Sarah a passée dans l'ombre ne lui a pas été trop facile. Bon, les mélodies sont hyper accrocheuses et les textes sont bons... Mais pas comme Fumbling..."
4,note book purchase,got was what was ordered before the due date and in the condition that was noted in the description when ordering.
2,Totally agree with Captain Midnight!,"While this author can tell a story (though he meanders and is inconsistant), the lack of editing, the horrible proofreading and the sloppy typeface of the printing took away from the story. Using the word ""breath"" when the author obviously meant to say ""breathe"" was annoying.I also bought the book on a recommendation from a stranger and based on the strong reviews from other readers. I guess they must all be relatives of the author!Don't waste your money."
5,A one of a kind read,"A brilliant and disturbing novel that hits hard, and will haunt and hold you spellbound until the very end. Astonishing in it's complexity....startling in it's originality....this book is a must read for those who love suspense. It gives an enlightening glimpse into the dramatic nexus of good and evil. I simply loved it!"
1,Pitty there is no 1/2 star rating,"This author should quickly realize he is no Thomas Harris and change his profession or at least his subject matter. With all the marketing behind him, I honestly doubt so much gratuitious violence will sell. Untallented, raw and humorless. Cardboard cutout good guys and senseless bad guys. I never got further than the page 90. Don't waste your money."
5,Want fast paced suspense? Buckle up!!!,"This book has more pace than an Indy race car. The Lizard and the Fly is a book you will not put down, scared as you will be to turn the pages. Once you cross the finish line, you're mind will still be racing."
3,Proof reader void,"The book had some of the historical information I was seeking, however whom ever proofed the scanning of this book obviously wasn't present. MANY of the words scanned are cryptic and gosssly out of place. The scans of maps are out of focus under any magnification. For only a couple bucks I guess I should be happy, but isn't that's whats wrong with the US today; poor quality is allowed."
2,great Fleischer Popeye - poor quality reproduction,"Usually ""digitally re-mastered"" signals some effort on the producer's part to clean up, sharpen up, brighten up, or in some way improve the image over the previously seen versions. This volume has muddy color, indistinct line, and looks like a copy of a copy of a copy of a home video shot off a motel TV. Even for a $1 at Walmart, I was disappointed. These are some of the best cartoons ever made, and deserve a top notch production. Too bad. Even for a $1."
5,cartoon craze praise,"this is a great purchase for any animation fan. Don't know how previous reviewer can complain, these cartoons are over 70 years old, how can they be remastered? its not like they can go and re-shoot the cels frame by frame. Get these while you can because in this age of 3-D animated films, these cartoons will sadly soon be forgotten. i got a bunch of these at wal- mart and i am going back to get as many more as i can. enjoy"
2,Buyer Beware,"I've bought three copies of this set,2 new and 1 VG. All three have the same defect on the B disk. It appears to be a manufacturing defect with visible damage to the metal layer rendering the disk unplayable."
3,Not for the beginner,This book talks a lot about comparative mythology. It was pretty rough going for someone who just wanted a rundown of Babylonian mythology. I also understand they've made some new discoveries since 1915.
5,Encouragement to run the race,"An amazing servant of God, taking the energy to lift up fellow believers. Following the Apostle Paul, he reaches down to us encouraging us to run the race before us, glorifying God all the way to the finish line, just as he did."
4,condition of book,"book content was very good, only disappointment was that there was highlighted portions in the book i was not aware of prior to purchase, else book was in very good condition and recommend reading by others."
5,Una de las mejores películas uruguayas,"Esta película es una verdadera joya del arte cinematográfico del Uruguay, la he visto ya tres veces y no me canso de verla.Tiene un drama muy bonito y con mucho realismo de la realidad del pueblo uruguayo.La recomiendo mucho, estoy casi seguro que les va a gusta."
3,Well written,"For an economics textbook, the author managed to keep it from being terribly dry. The end of chapter reviews are also quite useful and well done."
2,A fantastic sleep aid,This wasn't a class I looked forward to taking and this book didn't help. Material was boring and lacked depth.
5,Extremely Satisfied,I got exactly what was advertised and even better. I needed the book before schools started and got it way before. Will definitely buy more school books from this seller.
2,Agree on the Last Assessment,"The book is very hard to read because it does jump around alot, so I agree with the last review. I have to add though that in class as a professor Chris Thomas is much better, though his testing is very hard."
1,Used-Definitely Used,I received the book stating it was in good condition - this would be true if it didn't smell of smoke and have ripped pages! I had to air it out before I could use it. Not highly recommended.
2,Have to agree,"I have to agree with the other readers who gave a low rating for this book. I have read all of Elizabeth Thornton's other books and have enjoyed them immensely. This one, I just couldn't get myself into. I read half and then just skimmed to the end. I guess every author is entitled to a bomb in their career and I think this is Ms. Thornton's."
2,"Humorless, boring","I didn't realize until I was done that this was a reprint. From the beginning, I found the writing almost reporter-like, lacking empathy. The purported emotions didn't seem to ring true, although there was enough situational drama that it ought to have rung the heartstrings. Instead it was quite flat. Several times the story line went into past tense, which was less engaging, and sometimes put-offing. It almost seemed that Ms. Thornton couldn't figure out how to describe the scene real time. Adam had the kind of scarred past that I usually find appealing, and Claire was in theory a strong woman (who seemed to go to pieces rather frequently). Lots of secondary characters, many of whom didn't really add to the basic story line. I skimmed a good chuck of the book, just to see if it got more interesting. Which it didn't."
2,Dark and Uninteresting...,"I AM a fan of this author, but this book was just too brooding, not a feel good type of romance. Sure the turmoil taking place in France & America was very real, and this author didn't come close to relaying it realistically - one example: a woman frets because she thinks Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr might show up at the same party but noooo, someone says, the Hamiltons were specifically not invited because Burr was; according to history, things like that did not happen, and these two men, were in fact, cordial to one another in public, (I hate to defend Burr, but it's true). Sounds trivial, sure, but so much of this book was based on actual events, it should be accurate."
3,lots of good pictures and detail about doctors and hospitals,"The story follows two twins as they go to the doctor, visit a friend in the hospital and pretend to be doctors at home.It has very nice, friendly, comfortable, detailed drawings of all the above, but it's somewhat awkward to read. It's written in the first person, but the narrator switches from one child to another in a very confusing way. My prechooler and kindergartener love it, but I'm thoroughly sick of reading it."
5,Stunning tale of a beautiful friendship!,I love the way he is able to draw the readers into his book and how you feel as if you are right there with Nephi and Daniel throughout the story.
4,Not So Southern Rap {4 Stars},"With a sound that can best be described as ""throwback,"" MC Intellekt and DJ Dirty Digits unleash an album that sounds nothing like its contemporaries. MC Intellekt rhymes with, well, intellect and DJ Dirty Digits executes mind boggling scratches and cuts with amazing ease. Many moods and elements are tinkered with on this release without the duo abandoning their true school roots. The end result is a solid, cohesive album that should please the ears of anyone fan of hip hop music."
2,did not capture what i saw,"i wanted a cd that had steel drums on it like when i saw phil perform in the bay area. sadly i got a bunch of songs that aren't that great at all. The guy sings off key in many instances and also has a tendancy to have songs with horrible endings (songs feel incomplete). I appreciate lo-fi, off key, but not when its so overwhelmingly bad and purposeless. Don't buy this, buy the glow pt 2. at least half the songs don't suck."
4,"Great and all, but only two tracks?!?","1. Plug It In (Video version)2. Rendez-Vu (Roger Sanchez Secret Mix)I mean, they're both good, especially the Roger Sanchez mix of their old hit ""Rendez-Vu."" But only two tracks?!? Awww...I hope the US will get a maxi single for the song, I only hope so..."
3,Intriguing premise,"Wellman takes Thomas Jefferson's guess that mammoths might still roam a few parts of the American West when he told Lewis & Clark to watch for them, and says ""what if there were a few left by the time American trappers got there?"" You'll find a few Plains Indian legends that tell of killing what sounds like a mammoth, stories unlikely to be 12,000 years old when the mammoth is said to have faded away here, so it's not a goofy idea. Wellman takes an authentically crafted frontiersman of the Daniel Boone type and matches him with the sort of ""big game hunting"" surprise that makes a lively little novel. Fast read."
5,Why Isn't She Getting Airplay?,"I discovered Heather Nova's Oyster CD a couple of years ago, which was a very pleasant surprise. Siren takes it to another level. There is no excuse for her lack of exposure, and hopefully this album places her in the limelight. Excellent, passionate, and beautiful, from the ballads, through the pure rock -- and she can rock with anyone. Diverse and wonderful. Highly recommended."
4,Check out I'm the girl!,"I love this CD. Heather definately needs to get some publicity! It's a crime against humanity that such a great artist is going virtually unrecognized. My favorite song would have to be ""I'm the Gril"" Which is a fast past theroretical song, which I think may be about past lives. ""Paper Cup"" Also has great lyrics. My only complaint is that toward the end, a few tracks begin to sound alike."
4,..another great voice,"what else can be said about heather nova, she joins a class of younger female artists that keeps delivering great, inspiring music with so much heart. Listening to songs such as ""Winterblue"" and ""I'm your girl"" as well as ""London Rain"" its no wonder she touches so many emotions. Great singer!"
5,Nova is Avon backwards,"Heather is the complete artist. She has the voice, lyrical creativity, and musical style to draw you in and wrap you up. While I like Jewel, Tori, and others like them- Heather is better than all of them for a simple fact. Her diversity in both story telling and sound. It's a shame that it took her 3 albums before really getting the recognition."
3,"Pretty good, but inconsistent.","I bought the CD on the strength of ""London Rain"" and ""Heart and Shoulder"" which I really like, but the rest of the CD is kind of inconsistent, jumping from more upbeat to sad in no particular order. I have a tendency to play with the tracks as it plays to fix this. Most of the lyrics are good, though."
2,All those reviews drive me to a mistake,"When a read different gorgeous things about this album I thought: ok, let's buy it. I heard twice and now I regret about it. I mean: is not a bad album, but: c'mon, is just another one, similar to anothers records."
4,Good Recommendation...,I enjoy this c.d.. There's a couple songs I could live without but overall - a nice sound. LOVE the song PaperCup and Heart and Shoulder. For the price - the cd is FABULOUS and well worth it.
3,"Solid, but lacks originality","Although most of the songs are good, especially ""London Rain"" and ""Paper Cup,"" she has too much in common with Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan, Ani DiFranco, Paula Cole, etc. ""Paper Cup"" is almost country sounding, and the most distinctive song. It's beautiful. But generally on the album, she doesn't take advantage of her fine voice the way that Tori and Sarah do. I would definitely listen to more than the single ""London Rain"" before deciding to buy it or not."
5,Amazingly relaxing; a whirlwind of emotions,"The CD Siren, by Heather Nova is a truly amazing compilation of songs that touch the soul, and remind anyone of human feelings and ideas. Heather Nova performs songs that are full of human troubles, and pain, and they make anyone capable of relating to her, and her stories. The songs are beautiful, and they'll make anyone want to sing-a-long in front of the mirror with a hairbrush, in their underwear! The songs are truly remarkable, and anyone can listen to them any time, whether they are on a vacation in the Bahamas, or in an appartment cooped up in NYC. It is a truly amazing CD, and it shouldn't be missed!"
4,My Inspiration,"Heather's cd has really inspired me to really think i can get somewhere. coming from the same island that heather grew up on (bermuda) i really know first hand what it's like to live where the action isn't. this is truley a unique cd. she has aquired her own sound, noone else's. u rock heather nova!!"
3,Not just Tori...,"Has anyone noticed how Ms. Nova has totally lifted Patti Smith's vocal style for ""I'm The Girl""? Listen to ""Poppies"" from Radio Ethiopia or ""Gloria"" from Horses. Not the song style, just the way she sings. (Or maybe none of her fans are old enough to know these albums.) Although the Patti Smith/Tori Amos thing does bother me, I still like this album. It's pleasant enough, especially when Ms. Nova is being herself."
2,Lingers in the past,"This is possibly the most well-known CD from Heather Nova...her music has become familiar on the sountracks of many of the teen dramas that saturate the TV. That captures the essence of her music, teen angst...though better written then most. The music is beautiful, the use of cello is a bonus, but the CD is uneven and all over. Heather Nova is much better when seen live, avoid the studio produced CDs."
4,Nice Melodies!,"Heather Nova compares 2 the likes of Jewel, Tori Amos, and Sarah McLachlin. Lilith Fair quality!! London Rain and Heart & Shoulder r really great. Her songs r used on the T.V shows Dawson's Creek and Felicity so u might recognize her voice. - A music fan"
4,An up and coming artist.,"Heather has a great voice, a great band and great lyrics. She can sing rock, sentimental and just plain fun tunes. It the radio would just give her some more airtime, she'd be gold."
5,Not your typical Siren,Heather Nova's voice combined with the musical arrangements on this album are what make it so great. It's not just your typical chick rock singing angry chick songs. I had only been familiar with one song off of 'Oyster' when I bought this album but was happy to find that the songs were all slightly different and brought me through a range of emotions. Heather Nova is an excellent songwriter and singer and it is apparent with this album.
5,Heather Nova is one in a billion...,"Superb album. More controlled in comparison to previous records, yet she sings with so many different tones. The feelings conveyed are stronger and more touching. Still listen to this album..."
5,"An origional, and talented singer","It's very rare that i stumble upon an album like this one. From the moment i heared ""paper cup"" and ""Heart and Shoulder"" I knew i would like the rest of the album, and out of my large collection of CD's, i would have to say that i listen to this the most. It's good if you are tired and stressed because you can sit and listen to it and it has the effect of relaxing you. But if you are just doing everyday stuff round the house then it's good because it's a mixture of happy and mellow songs! A really good album with am equally excellant sound to it."
3,"Uneven, brilliant in spots","I continue to root for Heather Nova with no evidence to support being a fan - she has yet to make a great album, and Siren, her WB-touted ""breakthrough,"" is at least 50% filler (""What a Feeling"" is so sleepy, I'm lapsing into a coma just writing about it). I think that I remain a fan because of songs that pop out of nowhere that prove to be unique and winning - they don't happen much, but when you least expect them, they're there. I'm thinking of ""I'm Alive,"" ""Ruby Red,"" or the single ""London Rain"" that push Nova's spritely voice into something that proves passionate and exciting."
5,THE INCREDIBLE HEATHER NOVA SAGA CONTINUES,"WELL HERE IN HER 3RD STUDIO ALBUM ""2ND IN THE US"" HEATHER NOVA ONCE AGAIN SHOWS HER INCREDIABLE TALENT. THIS MUCH MORE POP ORIENTED ALBUM STILL MANAGES TO HOLD TRUE TO HER MELODY AND EMOTIONAL LYICS. WITH MORE UPBEAT TUNES LIKE ""HEART AND SHOULDER"" TO THE VERY POWERFULL EMOTION OF ""IM ALIVE"" HEATHER CONTINUES TO BRING FORTH THE GOODS! THIS IS A MUST OWN ALBUM FOR THOSE WHO LOVE THEY'RE MUSIC TO BE EMOTIONALY DRIVEN AND FULL OF MELODIES THAT WOULD PUT YOU IN A TRANCE!"
2,Didn't work for me...,Didn't work for me... I still wonder: where is the romance? The hero is a jerk...and he obviously still loves his first wife. The heroine seems like a poor replacement. The hero seems to like having her around because she cooks and takes care of his son. He gets pressured by his family and friends to act nice to her. He even calls his first wife's name while poor heroine is delivering his baby...
1,The theory of theory (verbiage),"This book raises one interesting theoretical question: does poetry have an obligation to be amusing, enjoyable, understandable, or is it OK to be boring, unintelligible, and ""theoretically"" correct? Like they say, I wanted to like this book. I really did. But, man, is it dull."
2,NOT Worth It!,"OK, I admit that I am the blame. I should have switched to different brand but I've been using Sylvania H7 SylverStar for many years on my Mercedes (x2). As other members metioned many times, light is quite bright for about 6 month. Then, brightness starts to degrade. Depending on your night driving usage, Silvania buld dies within from 6 month to a year. Belive me, this happened with every single Sylvania bulbs. This happens almost always. This is quite expensive light bulb but it dons't last long at all. It is so frustrating. Usually one light goes out then other light will go out in next couple of month.Therefore, you always have to have an extra buld handy. Don't waste your money. Buy other brand light bulb. I know I am. DON'T WATES YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,Works as advertised,"I have a 2007 Subaru Outback. These bulbs provided quality light for 1.5 years, in which time I drove about 20K miles (with daytime running headlights) which is on par with the life expectancy.In order to ensure maximum life, make sure you:1.) Do not touch to bulb with your bare hands.2.) Use a dielectric grease to coat the electrical connectors to ensure a good connection."
1,Short Life -- not worth it.,"Similar to others, I purchased these to replace the factory OEM bulbs when one burned out and they last only 9 months. One burned out and within a month the other burned out. After the 2nd one burned out, I checked the specs and was amazed that these were only rated for 125 hours. For the $40 I paid for the set, I definitely won't be purchasing these or any other SilverStar branded bulbs."
2,Don't bother.,I installed two brand new Sylvania SilverStar High Performance bulbs in my 2004 MINI Cooper in December 2008 and now have to replace them less than a year later. My previous bulbs (OEM) lasted for over 5 years. I'm going to give the GE Nighthawks a shot now.
3,"A bit better, but not great","In these days of $100 35 Watt HID kits, and that's without going to Chinese garbage, it's hard to justify stuffing a pair of these in every six months or so. With the amount of night driving I do I don't get anywhere near a year out of these. The light is slightly whiter and slightly brighter, but not enough to make any claims of HID like performance. I want all the light I can get without upsetting other drivers, so I have persisted with these, but the short life makes the payoff very questionable.I'm trying Osram Ultras next, 65 Watt but more importantly 500 hour life."
3,Just not living up to the hype,"I recently swapped these bulbs into my 2007 Volkswagen Passat and found a slightly noticeable difference from stock (Philips H7LL). The bulb produces a yellowish halo which is common at 4000K but, the brightness of the light fails to exceed the stock set. This product will certainly appeal to anyone looking to replace aging Halogen bulbs in an older car but, for someone looking to brighten up newer projector lamps, invest the $300 - $500 for a HID Conversion Kit."
2,Not Happy,"I bought this product thinking it would provide more light then my standard factory bulbs from 2008. Maybe the lights need to be re-calibrated to point higher, otherwise the distance is poor."
3,"Great Lighting, Short Life.",The head lights that came with my new car were H7s of some unknown brand. They lasted almost 3 years. I replaced them with the Sylvania SS H7s and yes the light was so much brighter and clearer but you should be prepared to replace these about every 4 months or so.
1,Buy this only if you own stock in Sylvania!,"This brand has got to be one of the worst ever. Unluckily for us, it's the only one carried by our local auto parts store. The bulbs last maybe a month then need to be replaced again, and we've used Sylvania's headlight, brake light, and taillight replacement bulbs, replacing 5 in the past 2 months alone. This is ridiculous! Have now decided to buy replacements of a different brand online to avoid wasting more money on Sylvania bulbs."
2,Not the upgrade I had hoped and they didn't last long,"Several years ago when I replaced the headlights in my 2008 Chevy Impala with these bulbs it made a 100% difference and I was impressed. When I recently replaced the factory bulbs of my 2010 Mazda CX-7 with these bulbs, the difference was only marginally noticeable. It may be that the factory bulbs of the CX-7 were better than those of my Impala or it may be that my expectations were higher this time around. Either way, the difference was not really worth the cost of upgrade and to top it off, both bulbs died w/in a week of each other only 5 months after installation. The improvement was barely noticeable and probably not worth the price of the ""upgrade"" but the fact that they only lasted 5 months makes me wish I had not made this purchase."
2,Waste of money,I purchased these as replacement headlamps for my Pacifica and they worked great until the other day one had already burned out again! They only lasted 10 months! I'm used to other brands which were also cheaper lasting 4-6 years. Very disappointed and I will buy a different brand next time.
2,These fail too soon!,"After using the H7 Silverstar in two cars over the last few years, I have given up on them. As noted in some of the other reviews, the light is pretty good, but they have a very short life. I was lucky if I got 6 months out of a lamp, and that gets very expensive quickly. If you are looking for longer life from the ""Ultra"" Silverstar bulbs, forget about it! Same problem - burn out after a few months, and you are facing the replacement expense (let alone the hassle of changing bulbs, and the increased risk of getting ticketed for headlamp out!)."
4,Sylvania H7ST 12V55W Silver Star,"Adequate as described, pleased with purchase, was looking for a more reliable set of bulbs and Sylvania should meet those needs, I will see how they hold out.Update 6/28/09:This product has delivered beyond expectations, it is definitely OEM quality and is still going strong. Simply gives you the brightness of fancy halogens with the reliability of OEM bulbs."
5,Brighter headlights,I was looking for a brighter headlight without a large expense and these fit the bill well. They fit into your existing light s and the change over took all of 5 minutes.
3,finally available on dvd!,"another in the series of 70's comedy skit movies like the groove tube, tunnelvision, kentucky fried movie, amazon women on the moon. this isn't the best of the lot, but if you like the above mentioned movies, you'll dig this too. lotsa guest appearences - bill murray, van dyke parks, buddy hackett, etc."
1,this DVD is pathetic !!!!,"Having remembered this on VHS from years ago you would have thought that this DVD would have been remastered or something of an upgrade at least from video tape. However it is NOT, it is absolute crud ! Poor video & audio quality all round not even worthy of 1 star. A very poor release don't waste your money. Francis the talking pig deserves better than this."
2,Bill Murray Lite,"This is a series of sketch comedy. Some work, some don't, but none of them are laugh out loud funny. I bought this for the Bill Murray piece. Unfortunately, I've seen better (and worse) pieces by him on Saturday Night Live. I should have bought that. The Woody Allen take off is okay. To be fair, I made the purchase fully expecting tripe. I was just hoping for a better Bill Murray character. I would have rated it one star, but there is just enough going for it, to keep me from throwing it out after I watched once. This is one you'll have to buy, if you want to see it, because I highly doubt that it's on any rental or library shelves."
3,Go buy a used VHS tape instead of this dvd version!,"I enjoyed the movie itself, I'd say it's a 3 star movie nothing great, but not bad. The dvd I received was from Miracle Pictures. It looks like it was recorded from an old vhs tape, and the sound quality is crap! It's sounds like the volume was all the way up or something, so that kind of took away from my enjoyment of the film. I would not recommend this dvd, version I would go buy a used vhs tape instead or what for a better dvd release."
4,Great reference for web designers!,"The book is a big compilation, presenting the best works in international web design. This book brings great examples from the greatest designers and web design studios as Razorfish, Entropy8, Meta Design, Carlos Segura, Frog Design, among others. Also comes with a great cd-rom, bringing interviews, samples of work, tips and a little ""hands-on-training"" workshop, explaning how a web design project would normally flow. Beautiful pages, totally illustrated and nice printing! Great to have and to inspire your future works!"
1,Artistic But Not Usable,"Like most of the websites described in the book, this book isn't very usable because it's trying so hard to be ""artistic."" The screen shots are blurry and the text and graphics are combined in such a way that it makes it difficult to read.I could forgive the author if content was good, but it's not. Most of the websites that are described aren't usable in the real world. The use of frames, Flash and poor navigation is the norm throughout. All of which should be avoided when developing a website in most cases.I bought this book for inspiration and it didn't inspire even one idea. If you're a web designer looking for inspiration, you might consider The Web Design Wow Book or The Big Book of Ideas. I use both books regularly to jump start the creative process.Best Regards, Bill"
2,New condition huh o.0,"Little difficult to swallow for an 80 year old book with creases on the paper cover, new condition would mean immaculate appearance no wrinkles hasn't seen the outside been kept in the dark this book is not new more closely to fair condition $198.99 is museum quality"
3,sylvania h13XV BP same as stock ram lights,"Great speed of delivery as always. The lights just are not equal to the write up on the product page. I can't see the 35% brighter. I don't see any difference in driving or looking into the headlights. I changed the passenger side first and drove around for a few days. Looked into the headlights at night, asked friends, wife, no difference. Can't see any difference on the road. Pulled up close to the garage door at night and I could see a slight difference in color."
4,A Good Product,Brighter than factory bulbs on my 2005 F250. I can see a lot better at night with these lights installed.
3,Not what you may be expecting,"Do not get me wrong, they work ok. However, they are not all that more intense than the regular OEM halogen bulbs. If your OEM's have gone off and want to replace them, then these are a good choice. If you just want to ""upgrade"" these will not give your a noticeable advantage, to be honest it ""almost"" feels like false advertising when you read the promos in these ones. Unfortunately for this size there are not a lot of DOT approved options in terms of higher intensity bulbs. GOOD LUCK!"
5,I like em.,We were looking for better headlight bulbs and decided on these. It seems the Silverlight bulbs appeared to be brighter but these had more usable light. Made a big difference in our night vision.
3,Nice Price ..... Short Life,These bulbs arrived quickly ....field of Vision is great.....they just don't last very long ...... about 4-6 weeks ...we drive at night alot...... if you dont drive very littleat night they might last 4-6 monthsI would give up distance for a bulb that lasts longer
2,"Not clue, not even close...",My wife loves clue...anything with the clue name on it she has to have and she plays all of the different clue games. However when we played this one with a few friends it was highly disappointing and wasn't very fun at all. I know i didn't care for it and she doesn't seem to like it much either since we haven't played it since. If you are wanting to add it to your collection great but don't look for anything that spectacular either. The next trip we go on we may take it but even then it is for 3 players like most versions of clue so it will be near worthless to us as well.
5,Sierra Club Naturalist's Guide First Rate,"Stephen Whitney has taken most of the University of California Press guides and books and done an excellent job of condensing a wide range of biotic and abiotic topics. I highly recommend this guide to anyone interested in the Sierra Nevada, whether a teacher, backpacker, student, or amateur naturalist.Rod Atchley B.A. Biological Science California State University Fresno"
1,"Poorly made, falls apart almost instantly","I just used this for the first time. Within one minute, the threads holding the adapter to the wand slipped, and I was covered in water. I redid the joint again and again with the same result. This is not well engineered or well made at all.Save your money, don't buy this garbage."
2,Awesome idea and very useful but not durable,"I bought one of these about a year ago. I love the idea because you essentially have a self rinsing brush, endless supply of clean soapy water and no bucket. I've cleaned my travel trailer with it for about a year and today I was starting to clean my house and the cheap plastic soap valve broke. I went to Advance Auto to buy a new one and the plastic soap housing was cracked (of course, after I got home and started to use it). Do yourself a favor and don't buy it. I wish someone would make this in a more durable design. It is a very practical concept."
4,Good for the price,"I haven't used one of these before, so I can't compare it to other brands, but I purchased it to wash down my siding and it did a good job. It seems pretty durable and it's easy to use. There is a trigger lock to keep the spray on without holding it down, and a quick disconnect to switch from brush to hose for rinsing."
1,No Suds No Go,"This product arrived missing parts and appeared to be a used or returned item as it was dirty and had some scratches. We returned it without additional cost and Amazon quickly refunded our account without problems or delay. Considering our first experience with the Carrand Suds N Go was so disappointing, we purchased a different product by a different maker. All was well that ended well. Thanks Amazon."
1,Susan Slept Here,I'm only responding to this review because I have received noresponse to my numerous e-mails regarding this order! I havenot received this video but yet I was billed for this item onJune 23rd. I have sent three notices!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASEsomeone respond to my inquiries. I am NOT a happy customer!!!!
5,ATTENTION ALL MUSIC LISTENERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE FINEST LIVE PERFORMANCES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I AM 48 YEARS OLD AND A HUGE FAN OF FRANK ZAPPA'S MUSIC. PLEASE ALL AGE GROUPS BUY THIS ! WATCH LISTEN AND LEARN. THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IS REALLY PRODUCING NOTHING BUT CRAP TODAY. VERY LITTLE TALENT, IT ALL SOUNDS THE SAME.FRANK ZAPPA WAS LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE. A LITTLE STRANGE ABSOLUTELY, NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. LISTEN TO THE COMPLEXITY AND BEAUTY OF THE MUSIC.A HUGE THANK YOU TO DWEEZIL ZAPPA (SEE YOU IN ALBANY N.Y.)THE ZAPPA PLAYS ZAPPA BAND AND THE ZAPPA FAMILY TRUST FOR KEEPING THIS INCREDIBLE MUSIC GOING. I HOPE YOU WONDERFUL MUSICIANS HAD AS MUCH FUN PLAYING THIS AS YOU SEEMED TO ON THE DVD.I SAT MY 11,12,AND 17 YEAR OLD SONS DOWN AND MADE THEM WATCH THIS WITH MY WIFE AND I. THEY WERE BLOWN AWAY AND TOLD ALL THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT IT.BUY THIS, BUY THIS, BUY THIS. ENJOY !!! FRANK WE MISS YOU !"
5,Zappa what can you say!,Zappa ! it takes a bunch of first class musicians just to attempt to play his stuff.Not many kids would play their fathers music and be able to due it well at that. well worth getting just to see a son honoring his father as well he did.
1,sappy ballads,"The compositions, Rhythms and singin-style of Peter Cetera sound always the same. He is a typical sappy love song - singer who prefers the love ballads and cheesy love adventures.it might have been a bit tedious and boring.The problem is everywhere: If you are a Hardrock fan like bands Uriah Heep, Stevie Ray Vaughan, AC/DC, Rory Gallagher, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, your ears can't be familar with all these silly love songs. My ears cannot work like that.there are two alternatives:- if you are a hardrock fan. You like a mythological lyrics, you won't like Peter Cetera or Chicago. Keep your fingers away from this !!!- if you are a sappy love song fan then please buy this cd !!!"
5,Another great collection,"This is a very interesting album that combines songs sung by Peter Cetera, Jason Scheff, and Bill Champlin. With 1989 song of the year ""Look Away""(according to VH1), #1 hit ""Hard to Say I'm Sorry"", ""Hard Habit to Break"", ""Along Comes A Woman"", the soft and melodious ""Will You Still Love Me?"", the hard rockin' ""Stay the Night"", and the classic ballad, ""You're the Inspiration"", you'll understand why Chicago notified as the 2nd most successful American band of all time (according to an All-Music guide)! Check out their first ""Greatest Hits"" album, too!"
3,Bought as a Gift,"I was a little disappointed with this CD, as I didn't recognize as many of the songs as I hoped. It arrived quickly and in good condition."
5,"For Chicago Fans, this is the best","This CD is absolutely a great collection. From Hard Habit to Break (my fave) to Stay the night, this CD is definately worth the buy."
4,#20 could have been better,"This album contained more radio hits than any other album except number 9 ""Greatest hits #1"". ""Hard to Say I'm Sorry"", ""You're the Inspiration"", ""Hard Habit to Break"", ""Along Comes A Woman"", and ""Stay the Night"" were all the hits with Peter Cetera as lead vocal. When Peter Cetera left, the band still remained hot with songs ""Will You Still Love Me?"", ""Look Away"", ""I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love"", and ""What Kind of Man Would I be?"" I would give this album 5 stars, but it wasn't complete because it didn't contain the top 10 hit ""You're Not Alone"". In my opinion this was the last successful album Chicago has ever did."

3,"Some Hits, Some Misses","Lots of hits, but not enough on this CD to warrant its title. Most fans of the group already own the original albums, and thus, this CD is for Chicago neophytes only."
3,"The ""Mellow"" Album","This manages to distill the hits from CHICAGO 16, 17, 18 & 19 down to one easy-listening marathon. ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"", ""Look Away"", ""Will You Still Love Me?"", ""Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""Along Comes A Woman"" are all the original album versions, not the edited or remixed single versions. With ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"" it's a bonus, as ""Get Away"" is possibly the best part. And ""Will You Still Love Me?"" DESERVES to be heard in full. But ""Along Comes A Woman"" was even MORE exciting as a single-maybe too jarring for THIS collection! Also, ""What Kind Of Man Would I Be?"" is a remix-- when it wasn't a single in the first place. Personally, I'll take the 4 full albums, where these mellow tunes fit better BETWEEN the rockers I enjoy so much."
1,Slapstick & boring,"Too slapstick, silly & boring. I couldn't suffer through the first episode of this one."
1,the most unoriginal Gonzo show yet,this show has copied off of other Gonzo shows and makes this the most unoriginal Gonzo show yet. The plotline is very similar to Hellsing and so are the characters. Rosette is like Alucard (though Alucard is 10x better) Integra=Sister Kate and Chrono=Victoria. Tise show also steals Full Metal Fumoffu?/Full Metal Panic's humor and comedy in the slapstick and [...] humor found in the show. other than the stealing from other Gonzo shows the music is horrible/ the CG [...] and the characters are unbelieveable. if you want a good show buy Hellsing or Full Metal Panic not a show that [...].
1,Sister Aimee: The Aimee Semple Mcpherson Story,Sister Aimee: The Aimee Semple Mcpherson Story is a fake and lame movie. This movie sucks!!! Do not buy it.
1,Waste of Time,"This amateur production was a waste of time and money. The dialogue, when you could hear it, was puerile. The sound editing was some of the worst that I have ever heard. The acting was B-movie grade at best. It was visually sloppy and awkward. We could not finish the film, and we have sat through some poor films. There also seemed to be a very strong Christian agenda to this production. We rented it from Blockbuster and expected a secular approach to the storytelling. Instead, it was as if we spent $5 to go to a church that we didn't want to go to. It seems as though, form other sources, this person's life story provides a compelling topic but you would never know from this film. Get the PBS documentary instead. I wish that we did."
5,"Inspiring, Lifechanging, Transforming","I have watched Sister Aimee a few weeks ago and I STILL have the images in my head!If you are looking for a million dollar Hollywood production, shot in 35mm and special effects, Sister Aimee is probably not the right movie for you.But if you are interested in a fantastic piece of storytelling told by truthful actors and directed by a man who knows how to keep you engaged, you should definitely get this movie!!!"
1,"lousy movie, great topic","If you've forgotten the importance of quality in a script, casting and execution of film, five minutes of ""Sister Aimee..."" will bring it all back to life for you. Simplistic, mundane, aesthetically unpleasant, and a waste of good film describes this movie's strengths. Too bad, too - Aimee Semple McPherson is such a compelling character of the early 20th century, and good biographies, both documentary and dramatization, are needed to tell this compelling story. This, especially because from this story come many of the principled debates of today - religion, celebrity, public scandal and political power."
5,ROCKS,"I listened to c couple of tracks in this album and i had to go buy another pair of speakers in COMPUSA because 2 of them blew up at the sametime LMAO!!!. Bone thugs just rocks the music industry... people have their eyes closed. I swear you guys gotta buy this album. I first downloaded to check it out, but ended up buying it in virgin records just like thugs revenege album lol. Very nice F*****g album."
2,"No ""Lord of the Flies""","Save your money on this one. Very poor quality: Fliming, Sound, Story and acting. Sure there are some nude boys running around, but it is a very stupid plot."
1,Not enough story,The author of this did not put enough of a story to justify the boys running around naked. A better storyline would have justified the naked boys on the beach and running around. Some will say I did not understand the dvd but I did and what he did was to toss in a lame background to justify the nakedness in the story. He should have taken the man out of it entirely and just had the boys run from home and meet on the beach. Anyway this is only my opinion and others may get more out of the movie.
4,Why Get It?,"Unfortunately I cannot even review this film. While I am curious about it, in this day and age of internet spying and government logging of everything we buy and say online, I'm now left feeling like I really shouldn't even order this movie out of curiosity because I might be put on some watch list. So as one who is curious about it, I'll probably never get to make up my own mind about it. I'm too scared to order it. I gave it four stars because since I don't like seeing the same types of movies over and over, and since I do like finding rarely-played movies on satellite, I'd probably enjoy something like this... But again... I can't even bring myself to try."
3,"Dated, but okay","I purchased this movie as a gift, but I did get a chance to view it. You need to take this movie for what it is...a Class ""B"" movie from the '60's (?). It appears to be a remake of ""The Lord of the Flies"",only in Italy. The adult roles are played by the same male actor, which demonstrates that this was a low budget film. The producers failed to digitally remaster this film for DVD, which compromises the quality of the film, but it is still passible. It would have been interesting if the producers went back to the child actors today and interviewed them about their experience making this movie and how it did, or didn't, affect their lives. That would have been an excellent extra for this DVD. Definitley worth seeing. There is nothing ""offensive"" in this movie."
5,The Genesis Children,This movie is about a number of adventures undertaken by a group of young choir boys. The adventures are interesting & this movie is well worth one's time & money.
4,.,"Very beautiful prints that will fit nicely into my husband's office. Gorgeous color & content. Our favorite is the sower, breath taking."
1,Extremely bad product,"This TV cost me $890, in two Months the screen went bad and it has low audio from day one."
3,Breeds of puppies,"I was disappointed when I realized that this DVD is about breeds/types of puppies. Our granddaughter really enjoys everything about puppies, but this was more of a documentary. Probably should have read more details before ordering."
2,The Beverly Hillbillies,"The Beverly Hillbillies t.v. show was great, this movie stunk. In the t.v. show, they were more realistic, they never would have shown granny smacking into a tree limb, thats like a National Lampoon movie, but not as funny. I think the cast was very talented, but noone used their talent well except the guy who played Jethro and Jim Varney who played Paw. It is still a fair price, but only for Paw and Jethro."
1,"Good Movie? Somebody's A-Greenin' Ya, Jethro!","You don't need no sixth-grade education to see that there is more of tragedy than of comedy about this project. As with most films based on classic sitcoms, this one falls flat. Although there are some very talented actors in the cast, they are completely wasted by being saddled with a poor script and even poorer direction. The remainder of the cast is simply inept. Director Spheeris is apparently unable to effectively stage even the simplest gag, a serious handicap when attempting to film a supposed comedy. The viewer is left with a series of unfunny, uninteresting, unconvincing, and contrived scenes, none of which is even mildly entertaining. Discerning viewers will find this to be a complete waste of time. The original series was far from highbrow, but it was downright distinguished in comparison to this mess. Stick with the reruns of the original series, and skip this little disaster. Cousin Bessie could have done better than this."
3,Director Spheeris can't stage a joke.,Sorry Penelope Spheeris but you can't. Most evident in the scene when the Clampetts give the finger to those people on th efreeway. Varney is too short to replace tall Buddy Ebsen as Jed. Film still has almost the heart of the original.
3,Ernest Goes to Beverly Hills,"I had to admit that the casting in this movie was nearly perfect. Almost perfect with one exception...Jim Varney. Not the fact he's a bad actor or too associated with Ernest, but because he was really too young. Still, he wasn't bad (you know what I mean?) and the story was funny. Not too much different from the TV show, just in color and a little more risque. Came out in a period where old sitcoms were being made into movies, and this one was better than the others."
2,Beverly Hillbillies in the 90s,"This is the familiar parody in which a 60s/70s TV show takes place in the 90s, a formula utilized two years later in THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE. Film however suffers from very few laughs since the sitcom wasn't very funny to begin with, and there isn't enough story here to carry about two hours worth of film. It tells of Jed Clampett, a primitive old hillbilly who strikes oil in his old country household and decides to ""load up the truck and move to Beverly (Hills that is...swimming pools, movie stars). You can pretty much write the film after this."
1,Must Have Not Seen the Original,"This is simply the worst form of cashing in on a franchise ever. The writers, directors and producers must have never seen the original show. This movie captures absolutely none of the charm of the original. It's a simple humor-less mockery. Spend your money on the original show, especially the first couple seasons, which were pure genius. Every actor in this debacle has great talent, they just aren't allowed to show it here, in this very stiff, very calculated, very poor copy of a great premise. It's like the fifteenth generation of a bad copy, totally distorted and unrecognizable. How Buddy Ebsen agreed to appear in this is beyond me. He must have really needed a payday. Cloris and Dabney are so far above this trash, they should have sued for defamation of career. Lily Tomlin's worst performance ever!"
2,Beverly Hillbillies Movie,"Not very well written, humor is not so humorous, but its saving grace is that it has lots of well known, very talented actors."
2,poor customer service :(,I purchased the item and found that the image in their ad did not give a clear view of what the product truly looked like. I wanted to return the item and had trouble contacting their customer service. I finally had to file a claim to expidite a refund. I would not do business with this company again.
4,tv swivel base and riser,We have this product in several colors to match furniture around the house. The finish is a bit rough on the bottom piece and the swivel will ruin good furniture. Both can be helped easily. I use a piece of felt cut to size on the swivel base and have softly sanded the interior rough spots to make it easier to dust. A bit of colored furniture polish helps restain the parts which are a bit off due to sanding. I like this stand because it comes assembled and it's sturdy. It's also nice that the tv rises a bit from the furniture. This makes it easier to see if you watch from bed.
1,Extremely disappointed,"The swivel doesn't stay in place. I turn the item so that my TV faces a certain direction, and it immediately moves to another position. Horrible product. Stay away."
3,Publishing Nepotism,"Tester was a former student of Gordon Lish, who published his first novel DARLING at Knopf, and was a flop. Amy Hempel was in class with Tester. Amy hempel was the judge who chose this book. Is this a coincidence...hardly...even if the manuscriot was blinded, Hempel would reconize her friend's writing, which has a tell-tale sign of Lish influend prose...this is proof that Saranbande's book contest is rigged. Most of them are. Publishers hold contests to drum up revenue to publish a book they already have but don't have the funds for; they just put the book out and ""say"" it won.It's not a bad book. Has a 1990s minimalist feel that is easily recognizable, some good sentences here and there, but lacking in substance elsewhere. The long time between Tester's firts novel nd this collection shows he probably had a very hard time getting published, so hempel rigged this contest for him."
2,Missed the target,"Tried one of these with a wedge style muzzle brake and ended up launching both down range. I tightened the sucker as much as I could but the friction just isn't enough to keep it from being fired off. Some scoring and welding may make for a firmer hold but product as is, won't hold on so well. If you get it, be creative to keep it on."
1,"Want to ruin your existng threads, or face?","If you want to ruin your existing threads and have your AK potentially blow up in your face... then order this adapter...if you don't like the idea of a 7.62x39 round exploding when you pull the trigger, then please, be aware..."
3,inconclusive,"I was really happy with finish of the part and delivery . I attached it the other day and went shooting yesterday, before I knew it....>poof< it was gone. I had completely forgotten that I had attached it but when I put my rifle back into the case I was like ""WTF..its gone!!"" and laughed about it. Maybe I didnt tighten it enought or perhaps the hole was slightly smaller then the barrel. I was just afraid to tighten it too much and strip the threads of the screws. I couldnt find my calipers so I was unable to measure the opening of the product compared to the barrels. I would suggest doing that for anyone that buys this just for precaution. Oh yeah, and tighten them pretty tight. Man this sucks but you live and learn. :)"
2,Not worth it,just not worth the trouble try muzzle that are not threaded. just did not fit muzzle brake and did not stay on barrel after every 3 round.
1,gouges,"yeah i got two sks thread adapters so i could put compensators on my sks's. so i put one on my chinese typ 56 and pop a couple of rounds off, then i notest that the thread adapter moved for word and gouge the front of my barrel and the screws were in nice and tight, but the gouges weren't that bad, with a little blue to cover it up its not notes."
5,Drawing & Painting Horses by Barbara Oelke,"This book is a must have for any equine artist. Not your typical step by step book, Ms Oelke covers many things that make the diffenence between a horse painting and sporting art. Beginning with a brief history of the horse in art and the impact of photography she gets down to the nitty gritty of skeletal and musculature formation, comparative measurements, views from different angles, materials and the various elements that make up a well planned piece of art. Posing, preliminary drawing, various methods, developing a horseman's eye and working as a professional artist are also covered, unlike any other how to book. All this is illustrated with exceptional work by some of the finest equine artists which each serve as a lesson in themselves and an inspiration to anyone painting the horse. The lessons learned here apply to any subject matter which place this book at the top of the list."
1,Avoid this book like the plague,"This is a terrible book and is definitely NOT worth the money being asked. The author does NOT teach you how to paint or draw horses. She does quite a bit with equine anatomy and a history of the art form and the actual supplies needed to paint or draw in various mediums.On drawing the horses she has about 4 pages of information and there is absolutely nothing on the painting. No discussions of the colors needed for chestnuts, bays, palaminos etc. No discussion of the best way to produce a dapple grey, or the colors needed for the hoof or eye.Walter Foster library has a better book on painting horses which actually contains some painting demonstrations. This book contains only ONE painting demonstration and that is a pretty poor one at that.If you want to learn to draw horses go and get used books by Walter Foster or Sam Savitt -- you will never learn to draw from this book.END"
3,Not as good as previous books,"I have many other Max Lucado children's books. You are special, You are Mine and If I only had a green nose to name a few. They are very powerful stories with wonderful symbolism. This book, I found to be lacking in symbolism and the power of the message of Christ, which is why I purchased the book for my young sons. The illustrations were also different from the other books I have and I did not like the computer graphics as well as I do the other illustrations by Sergio Martinez."
5,Beautiful,"This is the best I have run into for practicing as well as just listening, this really is the ""Soul of the Tango""! simply amazing!"
4,"Wonderful music, pity about the postal service!!","The CD is wonderful, am enjoying it greatly.However, the padded bag in which it came had been slashed - with a sharp blade - deeply, right into the casing of the disc. I was very, VERY upset, but didn't have time to mess around explaining it to Amazon, or whoever.....as was leaving on biz trip the next day.I play the disc, but am annoyed at the damage to its cover. I very much doubt that the damage happened here, in the UK.....I believe that it happened in transit from the USA - they are paranoid about stuff in the post. Or, it was some criminally minded US postal employee seeing if the disc was worth stealing - being classical, he/she didn't want it !!!I wonder if anyone from Amazon will read this?And, if they do, if they even care?Probably not.........Anyway, Yo-Yo Ma & the Tango music is excellent......"
4,Very good but not what I heard live in Cerritos,"When I first heard Yo-Yo Ma live in Cerritos several years ago, his closing piece was from the yet released Soul of the Tango.With that music, the subdued audience was enlightened. With only a Cello and a Piano, the music that was created was unbelievable. It was several months before the CD came out and I was a little disappointed that the energy that was present in the live concert did not translate to the CD. I hope that a Live recording or DVD will eventually be released which does capture the real Soul of the Tango."
1,Dont' buy this album for the cello music!,"One disclaimer first: I don't know anything about Astor Piazzolla. If you like tango music, this may be a good CD to purchase - I don't know. If you are looking for pure and beautiful cello music, this is definitely NOT the CD to buy. I originally purchased this CD because I was expecting to hear some exceptional Yo-Yo Ma. Well, let me put it this way, every instrument in this album, EXCEPT the cello, is about four to five times too loud!.... ""What a waste of a good cello peformance!"" is what I thought after hearing the CD for the first time. The 5-10 seconds you can actually hear Yo-Yo Ma play is exceptional, but that's about all you get.I don't know if this album was intended to focus on the cello, but it definitely does not....."
3,"Love Yo Yo Ma, but ..........","The songs that I wanted are wonderful and usually I love just about anything from Yo Yo, but there are several pieces that just seem to sound the same and therefore seem to drag on."
2,DIDN'T ENJOY IT,"I bought the CD for Tango Libre which didn't have the best arrangement, and the rest ofthe CD was not enjoyable. This is the second Yo-Yo-Ma CD I've purchased that I have been dissappointed in the selection. I won't buy a third."
3,Soul of the Tango,Would not consider this the best Yo Yo Ma CD. First song is good and kind of slides after that. It's ok.
4,Cute,"After reading the reviews here and at half.com I went ahead and purchased this video. I knew I wasn't getting a full ballet lesson and I knew this would not make my daughter a ballerina over night. But it did spark more interest in ballet and dance.Wishing Well Willy is a magical person who helps a little girl make her dreams of becoming a ballerina come true first by showing her three different ballet styles, Classic, Jazz and Modern. Willy adds humor, which all children video's need.The moves were very easy to do, they had basic steps and they made it fun for children to learn. My girls are 6, 4 and 3 and they absolutely enjoy this video and have watched over and over again. Worth every penny!!!!"
5,My Niece Adores This,I babysit my 3 year old niece and wanted to find something more educational for her to watch than some TV offerings. I borrowed this video from the library and since then all she wants to do is dance!! I eventually ended up buying her a tutu and slippers AND her own copy of this video. She loves watching Wishing Well Willie and the three instructors that demonstrate various styles of dance. This is a really cute video!
2,not real,this product is beautiful but it isnt real gold because my ring turned in about 2 and half weeks after.crystal
2,Same Old Formula Finally Wears Thin Here,"Those of us who saw SCB in the `70s were devoted fans and they were writing and recording some of the best pop music of the era.When their out-of-print debut came out the same time BOSTON's debut did, SCB outsold them in some stores in S. CA, SCB's base.They were THAT popular and that good.That being said, they did have a certain ""sameness"" album after album and some in-fighting took its toll toward the end--solo careers/bands were waiting so ""Perfect Timing"" was the result.Not a great record -- HEARTS and BREAKIN' THE ICE are probably their best, musically and lyrically."
4,pretty pan,"I think this is a very pretty pie pan. You can use it for pies or casseroles and looks nice on the table. It goes freezer to oven to microwave. I didn't give it a a5 because it chipped the first time one of my children washed it and bumped it on the sink. It should be a bit hardier than that. One tip, a 9"" pie saver is too small for it."
3,It might work for you.,"This is true ambient music - it does not reward close listening. It's in fact rather dull to listen to - a long session of monochrome keyboard plunkings and near-subliminal synth washes.I had this CD on my iTunes rotation for some time, and after a while decided that it did nothing for me. However, some people I've talked to just love it for their work or home ambience. Of Eno's work, I far prefer Shutov Assembly, Music for Films, Music for Airports, or On Land. If you like something more eneregetic and percussive, check out his Nerve Net."
1,Not 'Ambient'... Not Anything!,"As a lover & true fan of Eno, I can not recommend this release. Not that it's anything so important in his large canon of recordings which one must acquire. 'Neroli' is a long, barely audible piece which softly rumbles for quite a long time. Unlike another earlier long piece, 'Thursday Afternoon', which goes on slowly, twinkling & building only slightly, 'Neroli' stretches the conceptual aspects of dull & boring to the max which, for some, may be cool & akin to staring at a large minimalist solid-colored canvas for an hour!?! Two bass notes & some echo... well... sometimes this is Eno. This piece is better in theory only... Sorry Eno fans. I'm sure we all passed on this..."
1,Eno plays into his detractors' hands,"Speaking as someone who has loved almost everything Eno's done, I have to say that this CD is a dreadful waste of time. Sub sub Morton Feldman tinklings which meander on and on aimlessly for an hour or so. Also, please don't try to pull that ""you're not supposed to listen to it"" garbage, what distinguishes Eno's best work from the vast body of ""ambient"" dross out there is that you CAN listen to it. Don't listen to this."
3,a nominal release,"I have all the eno releases. this is an extended piece like Thursday Afternoon, but is darker in its modality, a modality called Dorian. It's not as uplifting or free/fresh as Thursday. As for the title, NERLOI, one can make his name out of it."
2,Eno Is Laughing Somewhere,"He is laughing very hard indeed. This album can only be a joke at the expense of those who take Ambient Music so very seriously. I'm an admirer of Eno's other ambient work, don't get me wrong, but this has all the earmarks of a rather extended in-joke."
2,Not music at all,"Apart from ""Ambient 1-Music for.."", this is another Eno album you better should stay away from. The entire piece is nearly 60 minutes long, without anything happening except a few noises and long pauses. This surrounding may be good for relaxation, but there are better and livelier ambient albums available."
1,Save Your Money,"Here's an idea. Instead of buying this album, tape record the sound your fridge makes with the door slightly open for about an hour, put the tape on, lie back and ""enjoy"""
4,Mr. Brown,"This is a very good album, I don't know why Sleepy Brown did not get higher ratings; However it's a very cool & laidback album that the older audience will love."
1,Doesn't fit the factory wiring harness if your vehicle has an amplifier,"I bought this so that I could replace the stereo in my 2005 Santa Fe. Unfortunately, there are two different Santa Fe wiring schemes in the 2005 model - one that includes a factory-installed amplifier and one that doesn't. I have the model that includes the amp, and this wiring adapter does not work with that wiring set-up. I have no idea if there is something in the owner's manual that identifies which set-up your Santa Fe might have or how you would distinguish between the wiring harness adapter for a non-amp vehicle and an amped vehicle. All I know is, that this one doesn't work with my 2005 Santa Fe."
2,a weaker schaum's outline,"Pitched to a weakish high school math background. Scant treatment of continuous random variables is one of several reasons this fails to achieve the comprehensiveness of other schaum's outlines. There may be courses where this is a good study aid (e.g. probability for poets), but it's a poor reference to basic probability for someone with a stronger math background.Like other schaum's it is riddled with typographical errors and there is no errata. Eg. Appearing twice:Correlation(X,Y) = Cov(X,Y) / E(X)E(Y).Even at their worst, I still find the schaum's guides (this one included) better than a typical textbook with the same scope. This one, however, the problem is scope."
1,"errors, errors, errors","I lost count of the number of mistakes I found in this book before I was halfway through it. There's no excuse for that kind of sloppiness in a first edition, and no reason for it in a second edition."
3,"OK, but not great","The book provides a very basic intro to Probability. OK for a first intro to probability for lower-level college courses, but too basic for upper-level undergrad and graduate-level intros to probability.I purchased as a supplement to the Ross text (7th ed.). I found the solved problems to be significantly simpler than the Ross text and therefore not significantly informative beyond understanding the basics. Like other commenter, I find that ""Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes"" is more appropriate.WARNING: there quite a few errors in the solved problems and also errors in the text (e.g. correlation on pg 130 & 131). IMHO those are inexcusable."
4,"Schaum's Outline of Probability, 2nd Edition","This is a good book to have in your self for quick reference. I have many books from Schaum's Series and always found them handy at times. I am in the filed of science for so long that I have stopped counting years. Students and teachers all should have books such as these; students can learn a lot from the examples and apply the procedures discussed therein to different problems.A note of warning -- do not expect tofind everything you are looking for in these books. However, it is safe bet that you will always find interesting problems that are solved in these books."
5,Classic Bryan,I've been listen to Bryan since I was in Jr high and am now almost 35. My husband has been listening to him since he was in Sweet Comfort Band a LONG time ago. I have very few songs of his that I've heard that I don't like. This is back when he was still screamin!! Love it!
3,"Eclectic mix, if you're into that....","I have Drew's other cd, Romantica, which is amazing. The music is hauntingly beatiful. I bought Zetaman hoping for more of the same. No such luck. Although this cd is far from bad (it has a very eclectic mix of violin pieces, and is very interesting to listen to), I was a little disappointed that there weren't any beautiful ballads like the ones on his Romantica cd. Good variety, and if you're into rock violin (which I'm not), you'd like Zetaman a lot. Otherwise, try Romantica. It's awesome."
5,You will never grow tired of this music.,This album has been a touchstone of peace and tranquility for many years. It flows from song to song seamlessly and with elegance. The music will change your thought patterns and heart pace and bring you to an inner center you didn't know about.
2,Not a dark horse,"""Always the Black Knight"" has some ideas that might have morphed into a good novel, but somehow it fails to happen. The story begins when two knights, Kyning and Deptford, arrive on the remote planet of Elva. They are part of a historical pageant, riding at each other on metal horses with plastic lances. An unfortunate accident leaves Kyning in the hospital, and stranded on Elva after the pageant heads off for the next destination.The remainder of the story follows Kyning as he adjusts to Elva, or rather as Elva adjusts to him. The society is a dystopia of sorts, with mild alcohol and subliminal messages keeping the populace dull and complacent. Kyning introduces his new roommate first to hard liquor, then to classical poetry and jousting. The changes will ripple far beyond their apartment. The story as a whole does not succeed, because the world of Elva never gets any real texture, and the plot is predictable in the extreme."
3,"Good performance, poor recording.","Good performance, poor recording. Certain sections of the orchestra are barely audible. Bad mixing or bad placement of mikes. Can't fault the perfomers, but buy a different CD."
5,Fine Bizet recording,"Not every famous conductor is good with everything. This is certainly the case with Bernstein who excelled in French music, Sibelius, Dvorak, but not really with Beethoven and Brahms. This is one of the finest recordings of the two suits by Bizet, Carmen and l'Arlesienne. There are other good recordings, but Bernstein's reading and conducting is fascinating here. The sound is very good too. You may buy this CD and compare it with other recordings. Five stars."
5,Bizet's Carmen and L'Arlesienne Suits,"I found this album to be everything that I expected it and more, thanks in part to the dynamic conducting of Bernstein. This is a classic recording. Sound quality very good."
5,"The best of Georges Bizet and Leonard Bernstein, too, at a super all time low price!","This amazing CD has both of my favorite Bizet suites, the Carmen and L'Arlesienne Suites I and II, performed by the New York Philharmonic with the great Leonard Bernstein, all for the low price of $7.98! What more could you ask for? This CD should be a part of every classical music CD collection, and would serve as a great gift to those new to classical music or Georges Bizet, as it is loved the world over. Amazon currently has some of the best classical music compilations on CD for under $10, so why not add a few to your collection and receive free shipping in the deal? I am considering buying a second one for when I've worn out my present copy, which often happens to my favorite CDs. Highly recommended for everyone!"
3,Bizet: Carmen and L'Arlesienne Suites,"Nice music, but NOT what I was expecting. I kept it anyway, but title is very misleading. did not have the music from Carmen that I recalled"
4,Easy for me to install,"I hate asking my fiancee to do ""manly things"" since I'm fiercely independent, so I was hoping to easily install these lights into my Jeep without fail, and I was able to! It's the small things. The light is crisp, bright and the installation was a snap."
2,5 Speed Mini Drill press From Northern Tools,"Received my 5 Speed mini drill press today and I am going to return it tomorrow. On both Northern Tool and Amazon's website the drill press is stated as being 1/3 horse power at 110 volts. The drill press that was sent to be was completely different than the one I ordered in many aspects. I was sent a drill press of 0.4 horse power and 120 volts. Working table size is 6.3"" x 6.3 inch. The body design of the drill press is completely different than the one pictured. I was expecting the sleek design of the rounded black head on the drill press where the belt is keept. I contacted Northern Tool, they stated the body design has changed to a square head where the belt is keept and other changes have been made to item number 155734. They are allowing me to return the item since they admitted the picture and description on their website and Amazon's is different and not up to date for 5 speed mini drill press."
4,Unexpected Gem,"I bought this, used, more or less as a joke. I am not a fan of romance novels, and this one seemed too ridiculous to pass up. I started to read it, and it all seemed very typical - but I couldn't put it down! It was just too good! Not only was it better written than most of the romantic drivel I've read, it was fun. And, the romantic scenes were great, and inspired great nights! As a skeptic, and even as a history major, I can recommend this book. A tremendous lot of fun!"
3,Look for a better way to spend your time,"TIME-SPUN TREASURE encompasses the time of the birth of our nation so I thought it would make an interesting romance. Our heroine, Meredith, never deceives our hero when they first meet; she is not who he thinks she is. On the positive side there is some well-deserved tension between the main characters and you want the best for them.Unfortunately, the ""mystery"" is hard to believe. The author has some interesting ideas but readers looking for incredible character development won't find it here. As for historical accuracy, it is of the ""wallpaper"" variety; Ms. Ring had the chance to do a better job. Before writing this review I read two more books. I had to go back to re-read parts of this story because the characters were so forgettable."
1,So much for Time Travel,"I didn't like this book, not the heroine, nor the hero. You can't tell me that a aunt could murder two women and several babies under the hero's nose and he not know it. I found the heroine a ditz and the hero to be a fool. I know that not everyone carries a high IQ, but neither are people really that stupid. I had hoped for better."
2,You know how to play solitaire ?,"You must know about Solitaire if you want to use The Oracle system based on this book. You can cut elemen and planet cards at the last section of this book. Combine with usual playing card, shuffle it with your question in your mind... then play that cards as you play solitaire. When you win, that mean you can have effort with your wish. If you get stuck, you can 'read' where is wrong ? Past or future ? Ophiel system not too much different with ""fortune telling"" with other card such as Tarot."
5,Two Great Gershwin Recordings,"I first heard the recording of ""An American in Paris"" on the radio, and I immediately concluded that this was a recording I needed to order. I ordered this CD solely for the recording of ""An American in Paris"", everything else was a bonus. ""An American in Paris"" was worth the price of the whole CD, but so is ""Rhapsody in Blue"", which I believe could easily be the definitive recording of this great work. Grofé's ""Grand Canyon Suite"" is a pleasant bonus, but not the substance of this recording. I would highly recommend this recording."
4,Rockin'!,Hail the return of Heavy Rock!! Love the riffs and the solos are classic Zakk. Production's a bit fuzzy. Nonetheless a great album to crank!
5,Guitar lovers...this album is what you need!,"Got this cd, didn't listen much at first... Then saw Zakk at the Whiskey in LA... Zakk blew everybody away! This album gets better every time you listen, especially if you love guitar! A must-get if you like Zakk's other work. Only regret is that No More Tears isn't on it live... that's what Zakk closed with live. (Better than Ozzy)!"
4,Zakk is Wylde as hell.,I bought this album a few months back when it was released and I didn't really listen to it too much. It seemed like too much of a change from his Pride&Glory days but I recently saw him perform most of the songs live and let me tell you it brought new life to this album. One of my favorites of all time. Zakk is one of the greatest guitar players ever.
3,"3,5 stars","A nice album byu Black Label. Its heavy and there is a lot bass sound (i dont like too much bass sound). There previous works was better , especially book of shadows. Here they sound like Black Sabbath but with changes in the tempo not so monotonous as Black Sabbath are. There are very good solos (as always). I hope they change their sound a little bit and continue the good work"
4,where it all began,"This album marks the beginning of my favorite band, Black label Society. I bought this album when it came out in 1999 and I still play it regularly, however each time a new Black Label album comes out I tend to play the old ones less because the new ones get better each time. This album is awesome and thoroughly demonstrates Zakk Wylde's jaw dropping soloing and skull crushing riffs from that thick sounding bulls eye les paul. The album is awesome, buy it now and then by Stronger than Death, 1919 Eternal, and The Blessed Hellride. The reason i gave it four stars is because the production is a bit of a disapointment, but the all of the songs are worthy of five stars.Bleed Black Label"
2,Dull,Derivative but inferior and muddy Zep/Sabbath stuff with too many guitar harmonics. Sluggish pace also. Very disappointed.
3,Heavy bone-crunching rock and roll,"My first experience with Zakk's playing was with Ozzy. Then on his ""Boozed, Broozed & Broken Boned"" DVD, in the interview extra he mentioned that Al DiMeola was one of his influences and this peaked my curiosity to check out his solo work. Three discs later, I can say that his output as a leader is consistent; he's a hell of a guitar player (not a great singer), and writes some heavy rock and roll songs. The only complaint I have is that this disc is LOUD, so much in fact, that distortion (not from the guitar) is audible and there is no dynamic range. Otherwise, a solid rock and roll disc."
3,Zakk Wylde - Pass the Sonic Cheese Preese,"While Zakk's soloing remains the same as it has been for the past 10 or so years, his song writing continually gets worse and worse with each album put out. In come Sonic Brew. Starting with the humdrum guitar riff of Bored to Tears (which the tune makes me) to the sloppy playing of TAZ, his poor attempt of an Eddie Van Halen ""Spanish Fly"" rip off, Sonic Brew really shows Zakk's creativity. The only thing this CD makes me brew is a big ol' turd. Drink Up Ya Rock Dinosaur."
2,Zakk's Latest Effort: All Sparks No Flame,"If you expect anything remotely similar to the acoustically written tunes of Book of Shadows, you will be greatly disappointed. In fact, it almost seems as if Zakk is deliberately trying to distance himself from his heartland roots in an effort to ""redeem"" himself as the wild powerchord crunching axeman of Ozzy Osbourne. The result is a group of over the top songs that offer little substance or melody. Unfortunately, ""Sonic Brew"" gives the impression that the melodic ""Book of Shadows"" CD was nothing more than a stretch beyond his stylistic confines. That's shame. As for ""Sonic Brew,"" it is an overly aggressive, underproduced collection of songs that offer its listeners nothing more than a reason to bang their heads. Typical from you'd expect from an 80's guitar god."
1,A major disappointment,"I bought this CD back in December when it was an import, and was eagerly awaiting its arrival, as Zakk is one of my favorite guitarists. However, this is not a good album at all, in fact, I think it's pretty close to terrible. The songwriting is horrible, and while the guitar playing is good, the guitar tone on most songs is awful. The biggest disappointment is that there are few true rock albums released anymore, and I had hoped that this would be one of the best. Oh well, if you want great rock albums, check out Mourning Widows and/or Gov't Mule. Or even Zakk's own Pride & Glory CD, which is far better than this effort."
3,"Good, but not great","There's no denying that Zakk Wylde is one hell of a guitarist, and I've loved other BLS albums, such as The Blessed Hellride and Hangover Music, Vol. VI, but this one just left me unsatisfied. The guitar is great, no doubt, but the songs just don't stick with me. The sound is not great on some tracks, and sometimes Wylde's voice is drowned out by the music. With the exception of Bored To Tears and T.A.Z., none of the songs really stick with me after I listen to the album. No doubt that it's a good album, but just not up to par for BLS."
2,Chronic Spew!,"I'm sorry to say that this album falls far short of the devilish guitar playing that Zakk Wylde fans have grown to love. The album starts off at a nice pace, but falters in the middle, and dies off slowly at the end. ""Bored To Tears"" is a great song with excellent lyrics, but this is not the case with the other songs. ""Taz"" is a great solo on the acoustic guitar, but this scarcely makes up for a weak structure throughout the rest of the album. I urge fans of metal not to buy this CD, and I strongly advise fans of his days with Ozzy not to be suckered in by this one like I was. Wylde is a great guitarist, but I feel as though he has produced a lemon with this album. Hopefully, this won't be the case when/if he decides to put out his next CD."
1,What Happened?,Zakk sould put down the brew for awhile! I think his drinking habit is starting to show in his work!What's up with people?You get the world in your hands and drink it away. Sad :(
3,An average album.,Nothing spectacular. These songs are ok at best. If it wasn't for the solos this cd would get one star.
3,Zakk Wylde - Pass the Sonic Cheese Preese,"While Zakk's soloing remains the same as it has been for the past 10 or so years, his song writing continually gets worse and worse with each album put out. In come Sonic Brew. Starting with the humdrum guitar riff of Bored to Tears (which the tune makes me) to the sloppy playing of TAZ, his poor attempt of an Eddie Van Halen ""Spanish Fly"" rip off, Sonic Brew really shows Zakk's creativity. The only thing this CD makes me brew is a big ol' shit. Drink Up Ya Rock Dinosaur."
1,Thick fuzzy sludgy muck,"I like melodic metal, heavy metal and thrash metal but this stuff from Zakk Wylde I just cannot hack. There is a review here were the guy threw the CD out of the car and I would have done the same. This CD sounds like a record being played with a dirty needle, the recording is so overdriven and fuzzy sounding it just sounds like they recorded it with the sound level full in the red. A wall of fuzz with awful whinning vocals, this guy definetly should not be singing, very similar sounding to Glenn Tipton on his solo CD, guys, stick to guitaring. The last song No More Tears sums up the CD, a great Ozzy song completely destroyed and turned into wall of thick fuzzy muck, it is not even heavy, just noise. One star for the first song which is good otherwise be warned this CD has nothing to do with the stuff Zakk recorded with Ozzy, with Ozzy his guitaring was great and his sound was great but this CD is just slow, boring, depressing noise."
2,Aging Glamour-Rock Star Hopelessly Outdated,"Should go over well with people from Baltimore and northern New Jersey. Was a one-star rating; the second-star was for his shamelessness in continuing to chessily spell his name ""Zakk Wylde"", a'la Bill & Ted."
1,Save your money! Don't buy this mediocre attempt at music,"I bought this CD at the local music store while Christmas shopping, anxiously waiting to get back in my car to jam on the way home. I snapped the CD in half before I even got home (15 mile drive). No lie...this CD sucks, period! I was expecting the awesome sounds you hear on the Ozzy CD's that Zack did...boy, was I disappointed!"
1,Terrible,"If you like Zakk Wylde's work with Ozzy, then don't spend your money on this garbage for it will forever tarnish the image of the guitarist for you. This is just ultra-sloppy, unoriginal metal. Guitar solos are pretty much absent, and most of the songs sound the same. I'm pretty sure Mr. Wylde was actually drinking black label when he wrote and recorded this. He put out *3* solid albums with Ozzy, and unfortunately, that will be the high point of his career."
2,Dated Information,"I bought the 2007 edition in 2011 thinking to save money. I found the information so dated to be useless for planning my vacation. At least 70% of the websites listed no longer exist. Current prices verified by phone are almost DOUBLE those quoted in the book.Also, instead of covering all the Bahamas islands, it lists only the half-dozen most popular locations, with the vast majority of the pages spent on New Providence (Nassau/Paradise Island) and Grand Bahama (Lucaya/Freeport). Those planning to visit Out Islands would be better served with another book."
3,Not as good as oem wires,These wires may work fine but are not of the same quality as my OEM Desnso wires I replaced. If you look at the Denso wires they have a white collar inside the boot (coil or coil pack side) that holds the wire straight so it cannot wiggle and come loose. These Autolites don't have this and fit considerably looser to the coil. Looking at them the connector end looked smaller too inside the boot. I checked it and indeed it was 10 thousandths smaller. Though not as solid as the oem wires they still did have an audible click assuring they are connected properly. I personally will be reluctant buy these again or recommend them to anyone. Get GM wires and you will never need another set.
5,Good product.,You can't beat the price and quality with a factory rebate. Easy to install on my 2003 Tahoe. Replaced plugs at the same time.
3,Shows Promise,"I agree with Laura Gee. This book began with a bang: an unapologetic yet endearing hero and the self-assured, smolderingly beautiful heroine and their electrifying first encounter. After their intitial (humorous I admit) entanglements in Kent, after the disappearance of the heroine's niece, the story fell apart, turning Charlotte(the heroine) into a sobbing mess and Stuart(the hero) into a semi-cliched and hollow character. The plot then ran amouk and the only thing that stood out amongst the confusion was the fact that Charlotte remained aggressive sexually--a rare occurance in a romance novel. But for a debut author, Linden shows promise and talent and I shall pick up her next novel."
3,A nice collector's item,"I bought this item as a display/collector's item. I took it out of the box once, just to look at it and make sure that everything is included. It makes a nice display, but I must say that's about all it is good for.I was most dissapointed to find the wands are held in the figure's hands by little twist ties. The scythe that goes to the Riddle tombstone also needs to be held in place with twist ties and the angel of death has his hands on backwards.I think that if you want to collect Harry Potter memorobilia, this item will be a great addition to the collection. However, DO NOT buy this item if you plan to play with it."
5,Nice little top,"This top really looks good on. Runs a bit small. I am a size 6 & the medium is perfect. I would not call it ribbed, but it feels good on the skin & is soft. The orange is a great color, near a poppy color. The scoop neck is low-scooped just right. The sleeves give you a little room at the end of the sleeves, so it doesn't look tight. The hem/finish all around is nice, not cheap. The length is good in these days of too short shirts. A good buy."
2,Nice fit. Nice hole in the side too,"Had to whip out the good old needle and thread and fix the massive hole in the side. I don't know about you, but I LOVE when this happens."
1,strange material on this american apparel shirt,"the fit and the style of this shirt were fine, but there was something weird about the material. it's like a super rough cotton and something about it always makes me kind of itchy. unfortunate because it looks cute enough. i wear it from time to time but can't recommend it."
5,LOVE this shirt-runs small though,"Be sure to order one size larger than normal. I got a large (am really a medium/large), and it fits like a dream if your build is on the slender side. Not really a baby rib at all, more like stiff t-shirt material, still I can't believe how good this looks on. Very curve-hugging"
2,Not Quite Worth It,"This is basically an hour long ""documentary"" about the band's first 2 years on a major label. By documentary, I mean that it's essentially an extended version of the type of on-the-road, backstage footage you would expect to be included as a Bonus DVD with an album. It's interesting enough to watch once, but really unless you're a hardcore fan this is probably just something to borrow from someone else and watch once."
2,problem child,"I purchased this amplifier and was out with it on my second gig when I heard a groveling sound coming from one of the speakers. I had blown one and was only playing at half volume. I decided to get a replacement speaker and received it and replaced the blown one with it. It blew within the next couple of gigs. To make a long story short, I have blown 3 speakers in this amp and have only owned it for 5 months. I have replaced the GK speakers with Eminence speakers and have not had any other problems."
5,Solid and Faithful Exegesis of Old Testament Prophets,"I am definitely in the biblicist fold, so I view critical writings with a view to gain what I can from them while retaining my skepticism of their general value. I need not have held such a view with this book. The scholarship is of the highest quality, thoroughly researched and well supported in the notes. Questions such as, ""Did the prophets really act in the way described in the text?"", are treated in a forthright, very objective manner. This approach is maintained throughout. In addition to being a worthy contribution in sign-acts study, Friebel's book can be used to illustrate how good exegesis can combine with reverence for the Scriptures to produce fresh insights into biblical teachings. I know it is expensive, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book and highly recommend it to serious students of the prophets."
2,Maybe For Very Small Pets.....,"I had one of these for my guinea pigs. It was fine when they were babies but when they got to adult size they could jump it. The construction is rather poor and the panels tend to bend easy, I only used it for about four months and it was in pretty bad shape by then. Maybe hamsters would be fine in it but anything larger, get a sturdier pen with higher sides."
5,Highly Recommended Feline Tribute,Lovely songs for a solemn cause. Pondering whether or not to buy this CD? Go ahead. Bast will be pleased you did so!
2,Not what I expected.,"I was looking for a book that would truly help me ""understand"" my baby, however, this wasn't the book. This book was fun in the sense that it had intersting facts and pictures, but it was much more of a coffee table book that a reference book. Choose a ""What to Expect"" book or a Dr. Sears book if you are looking for USEFUL information!!"
2,Very dissappointed,"I saw this book featured in Good Housekeeping magazine and was very excited to get it. It didn't live up to my expectations at all. For one thing, it's full of spelling and grammar errors, which makes me wonder what else they messed up. Also, the information on cloth diapers is all wrong. The table of contents is very difficult to use and there's no index at all. I was looking for something with much more in-depth information and much of it is very superficial."
1,It's horrendous!,"I'm sure the info is great, but it's like trying to read a National Enquirer! There is no rhyme or reason to following the paragraphs, it's splashy and loud and not user friendly. I appreciate all of the visuals, graphs and charts, photos, illustrations, etc. but wouldn't it have made more sense in normal paragraph form? Waste of money!--Mom of a 16 month old"
5,A good reference for a new first-time parent.,"My wife is in her first trimester, and so we've recently been busy finding pregnancy and child-care guides. I'm glad we picked up a copy of Understanding Children, as it's been quite helpful. I'm a mechanical engineer by trade, so don't know too much about pregnancy and babies, and was pleased to find a lot of easily absorbable information in this book. What to expect at our first ultrasounds, what foods I should and should not order for my wife when we're out, and even suggestions on shopping for baby clothing - it's all in there. I've found the budgetary information particularly helpful as Molly and I are just starting out in life and can't break the bank quite yet."
2,Just okay,"This book was pointless, but I've read worse which is why it got two stars. Will not be reading the next ones."
2,Disappointing,"GOSSIP GIRL just wasn't my cup of tea. It's pretty graphic with the language, sex, and drug use, but the real horror of the novel is the poor writing. The characters are largely flat and unlikable, and the story doesn't really go anywhere. There are some flashes of wit, but the novel mostly consists of cliches and situations you would find in any soap opera.If you're mature enough to handle the adult themes in this novel, why not graduate directly to novelists like Nora Roberts, Sandra Brown, or Jackie Collins? In my opinion, their books are just as sexy, but are far better written and feature much more interesting characters."
3,Gossip Girls Series,I started reading this book because my best friend had read something by the same author. She told me it was good and I decided to pick it up. When I first started reading this I thought that these girls lives were over exagerated and fake. As I read more into the book I saw that these girls lives relate well to many teenage girls lives. I would recomend this book or serious to any teenage girl that thinks her life is messed up.I enjoy reading this book because it is an easy read and I find it very interesting. If you are the type of person that mainly enjoys reading more sophisticated books then this is not the book for you. This book is fun loving and just a hard to put down good time. It is more directed at the older teenager age group and is an interesting experience for any girl to read. I would also highly recomend this book to anyone that enjoys the T.V. show Sex in the City.
3,"pretty boring, summer junk",this is definately a book you read during the summer when you're bored.it's pretty good. The other books are better than this one.
2,Totally Not Real,"It about rich kids doing whatever they want like sex and durgs. I doubt such a family would allow their kids to go around do things like that. Trust me, it's not worth it."
1,Same old,"Their just snobby, gorgeous, popular kids who enjoy sex and drugs. They get whatever they want and only care about themselves. Don't read this."
2,Talk about far-fetched.,"This book is a bomb. It's content, characters, and events are just too made-up to believe in. Sure, what happens in the world portrayed by Cecily Von Ziegesar in Gossip Girl is somewhat the same things that are going on in our corupt social environment today, but it completely leads one off the track after reading it. The character portrayals may be a little far-fetched. I think more people today are wanting to read about more down-to-earth characters. And about events and happenings that are more believeble and experienced by the readers themselves. That's all I have to say."
3,Nasty & voyeuristic look at over-the-top teens,"I was not surprised to read what I read in between the pages of this trade paperback - with a title like ""Gossip Girl"" and the cover bearing three model-like vixens, I certainly did not expect Tolstoy.This book is the equivalent of eating McDonald's - tasty but really bad for you, including the guilt of having indulged.The characters are vapid and the adults are ignorant. But the core of this story can resonate with the right person - at the center is Serena, who is being maliciously gossiped about and is a complete outsider at the prep school she has returned to after being at boarding school. Nothing is the same for her, and if anyone has ever felt left out, then Serena's plight will read sympathetic.But there's lots better teen-type reads out there, and it's not hard to find those that are better written and have a lot more to say than Gossip Girl."
1,I wish I could give a -5,"After working with teens for nearly two decades, I don't recognize the teens described in this book. Yes, it's fiction, but the characters are a combination of every stereotype of teens. It's an insult to real teens.If it were well written, I would get it, but the author transitions from one character's POV to another without thought. It is full of cliches, and detailed description of the designer clothes and purses that the characters wear. Oh, and don't forget the hair!Yes, our teens struggle. Yes, many are sexually active. Yes, many drink or smoke weed or are taking their parents' prescription drugs. But these characters (14 to 17) have sex with each other, with friends, with older men, all the while smoking, drinking, taking drugs, and shopping their way to fabulousness.Seriously. . ."
3,Fun afternoon read.,"Picked up the book solely based on the cover and blurb on the back. It is a wickedly fun look at the life of high society teens with nothing to do but backstab. They also party a lot and work hard at being rich.Blair is consumed with jealousy when her former best friend, Selena, comes back into town. Knowing that she will no longer be queen bee, she instigates vicious rumors about Selena, which take on a life of their own.The story is infused with humorous web postings from GG (Gossip Girl) dishing on everyone. The characters are ... enough but GG's take on the situation is great. I would have liked the story to end differently though."
1,HAH,"This book is a complete waste of time. If a teen wants to relate she'd be better off reading the Princess Diaries and comparing herself to the princess of genovia. This promotes the ""coolness"" of drinking, drugs, and sex all under the shallow outer appearance of being in with the gossip. Realistic? Maybe. For about .05% of the teen population. Teens are not let to drink liberally and let's face it, we have never been to a party with favors of kate spade bags. This trash may prove to be a twisted fantasy for some poor teens however it should not even be considered a guilty pleasure."
3,Addicting gossip...,"I'll admit it. This book hooked me. With its rich teenagers who seemly never have parents around and can party all the time premise, I wanted to see what would come out of it. It wasn't a terribly bad story. The book centers on a group of teens, some belonging to the ""elite"" group, some not. The biggest event is the return of one girl that was mysteriously ""kicked out"" of boarding school and the jealously, lies, and backstabbing that ensue. A couple of characters are very stereotypical, but some of the girl's behavior was not that far off from what things were like when I was in high school. I knew this book was going to need a sequel, I almost felt like the whole thing was just an introduction sometimes, letting us get to know the characters and background history. Some people found the whole gossip girl idea annoying, but I thought it was kind of cute, and I'm wondering who it is! I'll read the next one and see if that draws me in further. A light and relaxing read overall."
5,Not Disappointing!!!,"At first I wouldn't give this book a second look due to the offsetting and superficial title, but on a whim I picked it up at 11:00 at night and couldn't stop reading. You actually get to peek into the lives of rich teens in manhattan and all I can say was it wouldn't be a bad life to live. This book was funny, sad and all around a delight to read. It was not at all trashy it showed true and honest emotions and angst from the characters. I especially loved the character Serena though at first I hated her for her looks and all the things she had. But now after all the things and people that stood in her way and made her life hell in the novel all I want is the best for Serena and I certainely hope her new love interest works out. And as for her snobby ex-friends I hope they all get what is coming to them. This is a delicous and enjoyable novel."
4,"Engaging, Fun, Fluff :)","Among the teen books out there this one is really about young adults, or teens acting like adults. Enter the world of Private School New York, where kids pride themselves on drinking, drugs, disorders, and social status. This first novel in the Gossip Girl series draws you in so much so taht its possible to read it in one sitting (As I practically did). The plot seems a little contrived and loose, but is an effective portrait of what Von Ziegesar is trying to display; a bunch of spoiled rich kids.Live through the gossip supplied by a omniscent third-person narrative, and watch as friends become enemies, losers take risks in the social scene, and sex and love battle each other. A fun book to check out for a change from the usual teen fare."
5,AWESOME BOOK!!!!,"i'm not into reading or anything but i saw something about Gossip Girl in YM magazine and i read the review and i was like i have to read this book!These who live in upper east side all act [snotty] to each other and go around spreading nasty little rumors. One of the lead male characters is nate i just about fell inlove with him if only he was real! and Blair and Serena the lead female characters r incredible!Blair hating that serena came back so now she is the underdog and again, but serena doesn't have a pleasnt welcome and thats were all the gossip starts! i say a must read i couldn't put it down!"
2,It's reasonable..........,"This book is basically the 90210 of the East. The main characters are Blair and Serena along with their friends and associates katy, Isabel, Jenny, Dan, Chuck etc.. This is the first in a series of books that focus on the young and rich of the upper east side and the other teens that envy them. To me the book could have had more substance but if you are looking for a little laugh and curiosity of how the other half lives this is the book for you. Their saga follows in six other books."
5,addicting,"I started this book and finished it within two days. Though not the deepest plot, it is addictive."
1,"Shallow, shallow, shallow...","Just finished reading this book and I thought it was pathetic. Why? Because it's extremely shallow and the characters are pathetic. Like somebody else on here said, these teens are snobby stuck up rich kids who waste their lives getting stoned, drunk, and drugged. They do nothing but party, gossip, and stab each other in the back. If you like books like that, then by all means, waste your money on it.I just thought this book was over all boring and really, really stupid and beneath me. And I'm seventeen. Well guess what? We're not all this dumb and immature."
1,"Ridiculous book, and a waste of time!","This book is completely unrealistic. The teenagers live reckless, irresponsible lifestyles that are without consequence. The author is redundant and cliche. These books are often labled as ""guilty pleasure novels"", but I found no enjoyment in these bland books whatsoever. Reading it was a waste of my time. I enjoyed reading a 500some-page book on the United Nations and international politics TEN times more than this book. And I'm fourteen years old. That should tell you something."
1,Absolutely Awful!,"A friend of mine told me this book would be great so I dashed out to Borders and bought a copy. I read it in a few days and was absolutely disgusted by the end.The characters in this book are horrible role models and examples for our youth. These kids seem to believe the law is beneath them (underage drinking, sex and drug use) and their parents don't seem to mind either.This series may be a bestseller, but it has terribly graphic language that is just too inappropriate for teens. Books should encourage positives and teach morals, not shed light on the ups of being bad.The Gossip Girl books are nothing but trash; it's worthless to invest any time or money into the stupid series."
1,"Don't waste your time, read a better book","I read this book in honor of ALA Banned Book Week, and while I don't believe any book should be banned, I don't think this book should ever have been published. It was filled with typos and out-and-out grammatical errors that made me cringe every time I came across a new one.The characters were ALL flat, and while I felt a marginal amount of pity for the main character, I couldn't put myself in her shoes and feel any kind of sympathy for her. The book was just poorly written. It was like watching a bad teen movie but takes more of a time commitment.Instead, pick up a book worth your time likeThe Princess Diaries Box Set, Volumes I-III (Princess Diaries)by Meg Cabot, or if you really need to read about a poor little rich girl, you can't beatGingerbread,ShrimpandCupcakeby Rachel Cohn. I mean, evenBlue BloodsandMasqueradeby Melissa De La Cruz are better than this."
3,loved it.,"Salacious, overdramatic, juicy, scandalous, hot hot hot!It's just plain fun. And I appreciate that C von Z has brought teen lit into the 21st century."
1,Seriously...,"The worst book I have ever read. who really cares about rich brats and their ""tragic lives."" This probably only appeals to rich white kids. Which i am not."
5,one of the best books I've read in a while,"This book explored so many subjects, including love, sex, popularity,and so many more. I couln't put it down; I literally read it in 1 day. This book is so different because it's not like others I've read. It's entertaining because there are so many unanswered questions. Will S and N hook up again? Will B and N break up? Will D express his love to S? If you're looking for something to occupy a free Friday or Saturday night,Cecily von Ziegesar's Gossip Girl is a winner."
4,A story like no other,"I first bought this book because I was attracted to the cover but when I began to read it, it was so interesting and fun that I couldn't stop. The story is mainly about a group of teenagers living in New York's upper east side and dealing with problems in the midst of it all. I loved Serena because she seemed so sweet and nice and hated Blair for treating her so shabbily. Of course I think we all agree that Chuck is a loser of the highest order and that things were just starting to get interesting when it ended. But that's the beauty of this book-it gets you hooked and keeps you hanging until the last page. Naturally, we all wonder who Gossip Girl is-but maybe one day we'll find out. Buy it!"
2,Pick up something else,"I picked up this book because it looked interesting, but I was very dissapointed.The characters are not believable at all. All they care about is clothes and boys. The only long lifeterm goal was to get into Yale early- because it is good for social status. They have petty little arguments that are boring and pointless. These kids are filthy rich, and have everything going for them, and what do they do with their life? Absolutely nothing.And after every few chapters they have this gossip girl website with ""sightings"". Don't these people have lives of their own????I did like the setting, and least there were a few redeeming qualities, like trying get into a good college, but that was about it.There are great books for teen girls out there- but this isn't one of them."
2,Not as Good as it Sounds,"i just had to pick up this book after hearing so many people talk about it, it sounded interesting and fun to read, but its really not worth anyone spending ""money"" on, maybe if you wanna read it for fun just read it, but i really did not enjoy this book at all, i didn't like it =("
1,it [is bad]*,"I totally agree with la solinas and nancy cuz this book [is bad]. At first I got this book from the library cuz my friendz said it was good so I tried it and it didnt really have ne plot or watever. It mainly revolves around ppl getting drunk, partying, and [having sex with] each other. If you like these kinda books, read it and you'll probably be disappointed cuz i was."
4,The First Book,"Haven't finished reading the book yet, but I am hooked. I loved the show so I started ordering the books. This book has drawn me in. I've already ordered the next few books in the series."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"I bought this book with store credit at my favourite used bookstore. I wasn't sure what to expect, but wanted a better idea about what my students are reading/watching on TV.This book was a guilty pleasure read. I read it in one sitting and enjoyed the descriptions of the idle rich, white New Yorker teenagers. This book sheds light on the shallow lives of the main list of characters. I am not sure that I will buy or use credit for these books, but I would check them out of the library to just keep up to date. Yeah, that is the excuse I'll give.Criticisms aside, I do think that the books do give more than lip service to the cruelty of cliques and silent bullying that can take place among girls (_Odd Girl Out_).There are better books out there for the teenaged set: Francesca Lia Block books or Carolyn Mackler to name two authors."
2,"Good, but too mature for kids under 14","This book was very good, but i found it too have too much sexual content and the languge...Don't even get me started on what they say! There is alot of drug use, cigarettes,cigars,pot,and a drug called S. I strongly warn parents to not buy their children this book. Parents you can read it though;)"
3,MOVIE DEAL,I've got to say I'ma bit spit too. The book was good but the author did kind of exaturate on some of the things that happened. Incase I'm the only one on here who knows..there making a movie out of the boosk and it's going to be out next yr. Lindsay Lohan will be playing Blair...I'll probably see the movie but all around it was a ok book.
1,Don't waste your time...,"The reason why I gave this book one star was not because there was too much sex, drugs, or lack of morals; it was because it was just plain boring. It was extremely poorly written and doesn't make you care about any of the characters, even the pathetic ones who are there only for that purpose, like Danny. I checked the first three of these things out at the library and was really looking forward to reading them, thinking they'd be like The Angus Thongs books, but it turned out to be much more like a Babysitters Club book, only with richer, skankier characters.I recommend this book to: anyone who likes Dawson's Creek"
1,Wrong cover!,"I really wanted to have this book with the original first cover, because all the other books in my collection are with the original covers. And although the picture of the cover in amazon is the original one, I recieved the book with the cover with Blair and Serena on it. :(("
4,Gossip Girl is pretty cool...,"At the beginning of this novel, I was a little skeptical. The style of writing was not exactly my favorite. Once I got used to it, I started to enjoy the book. I don't usually read a lot of books, so this was a good start to the summer reading stuff I have to do. I thoroughly enjoyed the plotline and I felt that I actually knew the characters, which makes a book even more enjoyable. I also started feeling sorry for some of them, which kind of made it fun. I would definately reccommend this book to any person who would enjoy an easy, fun summer book about what seems like people who might go to your school."
5,GOSSiP GiRLS,"Gossip Girl is a book that you would read over and over instead of reading another book. Its a book that you can relate to at all times,with all the gossip going on. Its not a book that is a fantasy,its one that can happen to you. Its basically about girls and their drama about boys and a bunch of other things. These girls are rich and perfect and what everyone wants to be,so everyone just wishes they were them. This book is one you should DEFiNTiLY buy =] //SArA"
4,Somewhat Realistic... well it is compared to my school life,"ok well at my school, we aren't rich preps, but it's similar due to the sex and drugs...when i first opened this book, i was thinking ""wow this is so trashy..."" (which it is) but i started reading it again today, and i finished it in one day... it really got me hooked... now i want to go out and read the other ones... it's like a guilty pleasure... although i feel these girls are too stuck up for their own good but whatever... it got my attention and was interesting to me :)"
3,great mindless reader during APs or College Apps,"I hate admitting that I couldn't stop reading this book. It's horribly written, but it's so funny how she depicts all these upper east side kids. (and I live in new york, and I have a lot of friends who live on the upper east side).Read it for a laugh. It's a great mindless read and a guilty pleasure."
5,AN AWESOME BOOK!,"All my friends were reading Gossip Girl in school, so I decided to read it, and borrowed it from a friend. It took me only a day to read! It was very addicting.It was about a girl who had lots of rumors going on about her, none of which were true. I think anyone should read this!"
5,AWSOME!!,This book was sooooooo good! I couldn't put it down! The suspense is great! This is my favirote book of the moment you have to pick this one up. It's a little rikay at points but I guarantee you'll like it!
1,Not risque at all.,"I really didn't like this book. I thought there was no real plot whatsoever, I didn't care about the characters and gossip girl whoever she is, has no life since she spends all her time spreading stupid gossip I don't care about. It's not scandalous or mature or even risque. it's just not anything at all. It sucks. I think my brain's IQ started to drop after reading this piece of all too well marketed ""book."""
1,Ugh! It's HORRIBLE!,"How could any one write a book like this and expect it to be published? Obviously the author, the editor and the publisher were on something when they wrote or read the book. This book is just like the movie ""The In-Crowd"" minus the murder. And that movie was REALLY BAD! But for some odd reason i can't put the book down. I want to see if it gets any better but so far its not happening. If you really want to read this book, go to the libray...don't wast your money on this garbage. The characters not believeable at all! The plot, there is no plot. In other words it's 199 pages full of PURE [stuff], Cecily Von Ziegesar, do us all a favor and stop writing. I know its a little harsh but you would think the same thing too if you read her ""novel""....i hope she reads this."
1,People actually read this god awful bs,"God, why would someone write a book about how horrible high school is? It assumes that every girl cares about popularity and having the right clothes as well as going to jock filled parties. It is totally ridiculous, for people who want to feel better about themselves to write books about how mean girls are. Not every girl cares! Some of us prefer kinder books like the traveling pants series or awesome movies like ghost world and office space. Freaks and geeks is perhaps the best show ever about high school. If your into what is ""cool"" and ""hot"" and like watching god awful shows like the ""OC"" gossip girls books are the ones for you. If you care about anyone other than yourself, this is not the book for you! Writing is terrible and the characters are heartless. 1 lousy star!"
1,Gossip Girl...,"Though many people like Gossip Girl, I was not one of them. When I read the summary of the book, I thought I'd love it. Also, people seem to like the show alot, so I figured the book had to be good. I was very wrong. The storyline would actually be really good if it wasn't for the swearing every other word, flat and shallow characters, and bad writing. The only real description the book gives are about all the designer clothes the teenagers wear. All the characters are almost exactly the same. The only thing to tell them apart are the names and the fact that we are constantly reminded that Serena is beautiful. I am not a person who buys a book and then stops reading it, but this book was so awful, I just couldn't bring myself to read anymore of it."
4,Gossip Girl #1,""" If we aren't careful, S is going to win over our teachers, wear that dress we couldn't fit into, eat the last olive, spill Campari on out rugs, steal out brothers' and our boyfriends' hearts, and basically ruin out lives in a major way."" These are the words of Blair Waldorf. She tells the story of her senior year. S- Serena returns from boarding school, and all is downhill from there.Blair and her boyfriend Nate were at her mom and, and her boyfriend Cyrus Rose's party. Then Serena shows up, at the party! Blair didn't know what to do. Blair and Serena had been best friends before S left for boarding school, but they hadn't kept in touch. Now, Blair didn't know what to expect.This is a great book. It is definatly worth your time and money. I would recommend this book to people, mainly girls, who love reading of true, yet fictional stories. This is an appropriate book for girls ages 13 & up."
4,the original,"In this book, you meet all of the main characters for the series, Jenny/Jennifer, Nate, Chuck, Serena, Dan, Vanessa, Katie and Isabel, and of course, Blair. These kids provide all of the good gossip that makes up the book, and it's well worth it. This is a very good book, full of gossip so good it seems real. Their exciting relationships and ""all about me"" attitudes really spice things up, making this an excellent book."
