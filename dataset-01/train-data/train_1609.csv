3,okay but not the best,"This is weird but Brooke is one of my fave characters but this is one of my least fave books by VCA. it was not of her traditional novels. it was a bit boring, however it was great at the end!"
2,same old same old,"It was just like Butterfly, I knew what was happend next in the story. It just was not like V.C. Andrews. It was that very good not at all. It didn't have anything new in it, like Crystal did. Not her best book. She could have done better than what she did in the book. The book did not have the greatest stuff in it to really like, like Crystal did. I hope Runways is really good, better than Brooke did."
3,Same old same old,"Brooke was very simaliar to Butterfly, and the stories seem to all be the same but with differt caracters! You could almost writee the book after reading the first 2!!"
3,Same Old Story - Retold,"I admit that I could not put this book down until every last word was read, but that does not mean it is a great book. I had the feeling with this book (and the series) that I had heard the stories before. I went into my library and picked out the Heaven series. It all sounds the same, only Heaven and Dark Angel have better writing and it is just one person. I am curious about Raven and Runaways."
2,Very similar to Butterfly.... time to get the girls together,"The release of the VC Andrews orphans is getting too long and exaggerated. Obviously, all these girls will be getting together. Brooke was very disappointing in that it depicted almost an identical story line to Butterfly - instead of dancing - it was pageantry! Having read every VC Andrews book published, I am anxiously awaiting Raven and Runaways... I just think the publishing house is taking a bit too long releasing them!!"
3,I got it!,"Well, my husband bought this book for me last night and I read it in two hours. It's pretty good, I think the first two were better and I'm really confused about the next one from the exert from the back of Brooke. I wish these books were longer, just as you really get into it, it's finished. I'm also really intrigued with all the references to mental illness. That's new for the young girls to face these problems. Remember Music in the Night? Maybe the new people they have writing now know alot about those types of problems. Well, I guess now I'm back to waiting for the next one."
3,Haven't I read this before?,"I really like this series, but Brooke seems too similar to the first book (Butterfly). I've enjoyed V.C. Andrews books for years and can't wait for Raven and Runaways to be released."
1,terrible. please stop putting out these books.,"I was absolutely thrilled by the books that V.C. Andrews wrote...The Heaven Series, The Flowers In the Attic series, and My Sweet Audrina. Since she died @1990, this repetitive drivel has been published in her name. I bought the runaways series because I got a deal on buying them all together. I use them as coasters now. The books seem like they have been cut and pasted from Andrews' other novels. I will never buy another V.C. Andrews book. I'd give this series 0 stars if I could"
2,Just okay.,"This book was obviously aimed at young teens and pre-teens, which alienates all of V.C.'s older fans that she has earned over the years. Of course, I had to buy it anyway.I felt that Brooke's story would have been much more interesting had it been put in a longer book. Also, the book was a complete rehash of Butterfly. Extremely trite and predictable, yet better than Butterfly or Crystal. I wouldn't recommend this book for adults, not even die-hard fans of V.C. Save your money and buy the full-length Runaways instead."
2,Blah :-(,"I have to admit and agree with many VC Andrews fans -- these 'new' books written under her name are getting worser by the second! I'm a teenager and yet, I find these ORPHAN series to be very immature and unrealistic. It's totally unlike VC Andrew's original magnificent writing style. These books are more two-dimensional, lacks depth, and lacks mystery. Boy, it is a 1000 times more refreshing to reread the Casteel series which was originally written by VC Andrews. I really don't recommend these new books in the Orphan series unless you are under the age of 12."
1,Boring Brooke,"Brooke is yet another tiresome little book in the Awful Orphans Miniseries.Makes use of the stock characters 'Vain Trophy Wife', 'Emasculated Rich Guy', 'Bitchy-Rich-Girls who are frightened of Sport' and 'Persecuted Waif'. The Second last stock character-of well off private school girls being bad at sport (and the way All Girls Schools are portrayed in VC Andrews novels generally) is so innacurate that this reviewer assumes that Andrew Neidermann has spent his whole life in a cave. The only good thing about Brooke is that the heroine is a sporty girl rather than the usual VC Andrews 'Artist'. Aside from that sliver of originality in this otherwise stereotyped, formulaic miniseries, nothing good can be said of Brooke. I strongly recommend against buying this waste-of-paper-that-pretends-to-be-a-book, no matter how cheap it is."
4,Brooke- Bringing in the younger generation,"I have read the whole orphan series. Butterfly, Crystal, Brooke, Raven and of course Runaways. I enjoy V. C. Andrews. This is a series that will bring in a younger generation of readers. Brooke is about an orphan who finally finds adoptive parents, and learns from then that even with parents you can still be alone in this world. I recommend this whole series . I feel that teenagers would get the most out of this series. Yet I do recommend it to all readers, Especially parents of teens. Teen life has much turmoil and this series can show you the extreme that you may not have experienced."
1,REALLY BAD,"MY OPINION OF THE BOOK CANT EVEN BE SAID, I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY BAD. VC ANDREWS BOOKS ARE WONDERFUL AND FUN TO READ, THIS IS A TRAGITY."
3,"Well, not great...yet","Brooke is a completely new version of Butterfly, however there is one large difference, more of which I will come to later. Pamela Thompson wants to live through Brooke, by making her into a beauty queen, just like she was. Brooke, however, just wants to play softball for the private girl's school she attends. Peter Thompson, Pamela's husband is proud of Brooke's accomplishments on the field, but he can't help her at home, Pamela definitely runs the house. Eventually, Brooke, unlike Butterfly refuses to give in to Pamela's desire to take over her personality, has to leave the home after causing Pamela to age....or have a nervous breakdown.Better than the first two, not as good as Raven, but definitely getting there. Please editor, work harder..."
2,Lifetime warrenty,"Good morning, I bought this item years ago and it lasted for a good while until I went into the steam room. I had done this multiple times before, but I guess this was one time too many. When I called to get it fixed through the lifetime warranty, it would have ended up costing more to fix it than it would be to just buy a new one."
1,Wrong Watch,"I would love to be enjoying my light blue Timez watch, but I was sent the wrong color and had to send it back."
2,"Very loud, not very effective","This fan is very, very loud, and didn't move nearly as much air as the fan it replaced. Definatly don't buy this for a bedroom PC."
1,A note from the author,"One star? That was for my former publisher, who produced defective eBook versions without my consent. Rather than tolerate that, I terminated the relationship and the book is no longer available NEW in print.Get it for free: My own free Kindle and ePub conversions are downloadable... simply search forcharles gillen saigon station ""free download""Thanks, from Charles Gillen"
3,1001 Ways to be a bit bored,"I hate to say this since I have most of Lilly Walters' books and absolutely live by them in my consulting/speaking business, but this book held very few surprises or new ideas for me. For me, though, the best part and worth the price of the book was the Glossary of Terms. Totally invaluable."
4,Canine Epilepsy,"This is a very informative book, the only one on the subject I have been able to find. The initial section on diet seemed over long and complicated but the rest of the book I found very helpful. It is distressing to see your dog have a seizure but I found the content encouraging and felt comforted that the condition can be managed without resort to drugs. Some of the tips I have started to use."
5,Canine Epilepsy,">This book is FANTASTIC, beyond doubt the best book I have read on canine epilepsy. Caroline you have done a wonderful job. I am continually referring back to this book, and am gaining enormous amounts of information from it. It is written in a very easy to understand way.A must for anybody with an epileptic dog."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in the book as a whole. Coming from working at a vet clinic as a certified veterinary technician I was looking for a book to tell owners about who had epileptic dogs. I thought this book was not owner friendly and would only confuse pet owners. Having my own epileptic dog gives me insight to their concerns and fears. I think that overall this book will confuse owners and make them question their veterinarians, when they need to have complete faith that the vet is choosing the right combo for their pets.While the idea was good, I would not recommend this book."
3,Canine Epilepsy: An Owner's Guide With and Without Seizures,"The book has lots of useful information, epecially for someone just starting out taking care of an epileptic dog. One problem is it's several years since the book was published, therefore not up to date with regards to the latest medications and dietary information."
5,Excellent all around book on Epilepsy,"Living with a dog with Epilepsy for almost 2 years now, this is truly the best book on Canine Epilepsy that I've seen to date. You did an outstanding job of research and presentation.I have already loaned my copy of this book to a very close friend, whom I am sure when she is finished will be purchasingone and recommending to friends also.I have heard nothing but positive and absolute wonderful comments concerning this book! These comments come from people like myself, who are living and dealing with Epilepsy on a daily basis. The one comment I hear frequently, is that we all wish we had this book in the beginning; it would have saved us much time and heartache."
3,The Guineaman,"Interesting as a historical novel. It moves right along. The plot is borderline believable, and quite a bit of the prose is purple. The subject of the slave trade is the subject of a study which just came out. I recommend The Guineaman for its historical interest."
4,Good Reference,"This book succeeds in teaching the basics of Word 2000. Besides showing you the steps, it goes beyond some show-you-how books by telling how the feature or function works and tips. It does not cover some advanced features functions, such as creating or using existing objects as graphics."
1,not to standard,this is so far below the standard they have set .. it is really not worthy of the attention of anyone who loves early music. move on!
5,This is wonderful,"Truly, it is wonderful. It's all here...golf is just like life, which is why I'm usually swearing up and down the course. But here, I was really cheering for these two guys; I wanted them to have the perfect day and many more. A round of golf, or even moments like that do not come around that often...I'm very pleased I had a chance to read about it. Just one thing, after I finished: I wish I was their caddy that day."
5,Carlos Santana,"I LOVE SHOES!!!These shoes are magnificent! The glittery sparkles allow you to either dress up or dress down depending on the occasion. I highly reccomend these shoes and their twin pair (in black). Very Sexy!Carlos Santana's shoes ARE my favorite brand. They are stylish, sleek and ultra-chic. I have about 8 pr of his shoes and i'm always looking to expand my collection!!"
3,It was ok.,"When I recieved the watch, I was sad to see that the face was a lot smaller than I expected. Otherwise, the watch had a very nice leather band. Overall I was happy with the quality."
2,Faithful,"Although the Good News Vintage Negro Spirituals has some of the Legends of Gospel on it , I was disappointed. I thought it would be more down home spirituals not so much of opera sounding format."
4,Good Iron,Received product much sooner than expected; quality was great and nothing broken. Was exactly what I expected with no problems. Was a gift and arrived on time.
3,early testing,"I've only used the iron twice. It seems to do the job but trying to figure out the controls is - perhaps difficult is too strong a word - but could be explained more clearly. Especially annoying was trying to find the antiscale device. It took two of us trying to figure out the diagram and literature to finally find it.The controls also do not seem narrowly focused. Melted a spot on microfiber pants because of this. Took a lot of work to clean melted fiber from soleplate.However, lightweight, inexpensive, and once you figure it all out, acceptable."
4,Mostly Good,"Had for about 2 months. Gets rid of wrinkles well, adding water is a little cumbersome, still haven't figured out how to clean anti-scale valve."
1,Electrocution by T-fal iron!,"The iron had 1 tiny hair of copper sticking through the insulation right at the base of the iron... like where the wire comes out of the guard sleeve.My wife got electric shocks from time to time using the T-FAL iron and could not figure it out where it was comming from, until our recent discovery of the little hair of copper wire sticking through the insulation.We called T-fal and we send the item to them, they claim it is found to be not defective and won't fix it under a warranty.Spoke to supervisor Pierre Sterling at T-Fal customer service.Or... actually as in T-FAL NO SERVICE I would say!"
1,Bad Choice,"After only a few weeks of use, this iron is already leaking large spots of water all over the garmet I'm trying to iron. For as expensive as this iron was, I expected a more superior performance. My old cheaper Black & Decker iron does not leak after ten or more years of use and still works just as good as it ever did. I totally waisted my money by purchasing the T-Fal when there was nothing wrong with my old one. I will not be recommending this iron to anyone."
1,Do not waste your money,"The first iron I got leaked, then I ordered a replacement and that one didn't heat. I DO NOT recommend this iron to anyone."
1,A Very Short Life Span,"I received the iron in September. I've used it twice for a total of 4 hours. The heating element no longer works. Just like the T-Fal toaster I once owned, the appearance is far superior to the quality. This is the last T-Fal item I will ever purchase."
5,"So far, so good","I've used the T-Fal Ultraglide for a month and it seems to be an excellent iron. But honestly, my problem with irons has always been the short amount of time that they worked properly. I've had this iron before and it stopped working sooner than I would have expected. However, it was less disappointing than all the Rowentas I've been through. I've purchased almost every model of Rowenta from the cheapest to the most expensive and I had nothing but problems with them. Each and every time I felt like I had thrown my money away. I even had one repaired and a year later it had stopped working again. I expect an iron to last. My mother had them for years. In fact she rarely threw out an iron because it no longer worked. The only reason she bought a new iron was to get the latest features. So all I can say is that SO FAR this iron is good. How long it lasts remains to be seen.I do like the Easycord feature. It isn't perfect, but the cord does stay out of the way most of the time."
3,Just OK,Bought the iron because it was rated high by the experts. It leaks water just like some of the customers wrote. It gives lots of steam but I will buy something else next time. Just an ok iron would be better if it didn't leak.
3,"Nice, But!","I only give this iron 3 stars for two reasons. I think the iron is heavy and the Easycord is ""no big deal"".I have used a Rowenta for 25 years and should have gone with it again."
5,My Favorite Iron,"Functionally this is the best iron I ever owned. The extra structure around the base makes it very stable so not likely to fall over, the steam and heat output are excellent, it irons very smoothly, and the cord stays out of the way better than any other iron I have had. The controls are a little confusing at first, but fine after you figure them out, and the steam output is noisier than most, but these are minor nit-picking and well worth overlooking for its major advantages. I can't speak for its longevity since I have only had it for 4 months.--by Janet Locke"
5,Ultraglide Iron a dream,"I recently purchased this iron to replace a 20 year old relic. This one is marvelous! I love the burst of steam feature, and the weight of the iron is great for 'pressing' as opposed to ironing.I also like the many steam openings and the large water reservoir. I highly recommend this iron for daily use."
2,disappointed,"Got this today and returning today. Don't like it at all. Makes a loud noise when using the steam setting (can hear all over the house), dripped and did not get nearly hot enough. These are all the resoons I was replacing my old iron. Incredulous that it has so many good reviews....maybe I just got a lemon."
2,Impossible to iron cotton clothes,"Unfortunately, this iron never gets warm enough to iron cotton clothes. Even with steam, you would not be able to iron out the wrinkles on shirts, which will remain clearly visible. I believe a lot of people have the same problem, just check out some other reviews.On the plus side, the iron glides really smoothly, and the construction is all right. It did not leak, like other reviewers noted."
2,Leaky iron,"I had read previous reviews complaining that the iron leaked. I went ahead and purchased it anyway, and SURE ENOUGH, it leaked."
3,T-Fal FV4379 Iron,"This iron received high ratings in Consumer's Reports so I ordered it. As someone who uses an iron quite a bit, I was expecting more heat -- it says it has 1700 Watts so I would expect it to get hotter at the highest heat. It is also difficult to see the water level because the tank is dark red, however, that is not the greatest challenge. I need a hotter iron and will research that before I buy another iron. Meanwhile, this will do an adequate job -- just takes longer to get wrinkles out because of the lack of heat."
1,Buyer beware,"Consumer Reports listed this as their top iron, but I'm sending it back. It spits even on the highest setting. Not worth the price for me."
2,Good iron...when it works..awful customer service,"Iron lasted about 18 months...and for about 12 of those months, it was used maybe once every few weeks.Spent about $50 on it, and for that money (and the minimal use I put it through) I would expect it to last much longer than it did. Basically, the water pump packed up, and would not automatically dispense steam when placed on a shirt. It would only give out steam when the button was pushed.Called Joe @ their customer service...the guy had a real attitude problem and did nothing to keep me as a customer.A 1 year warranty does not cut it for this kind of product in my opinion.Will not buy a TFal iron again."
5,T-Fal Ultraglide Easycord Iron,"I really am happy with this iron.I have had several irons from $30 to $80, and so far this iron lives up to its claims.It isn't too heavy, has great steam, easly glide. All in all, it's a great iron."
5,Impressed!,"I have used the T-Fal Ultraglide for several weeks now and love it! It is light weight (much better than my previous Black & Decker)and puts out a lot of steam. I have had no problem with it ""dripping"" either.The easycord feature is a big plus since it does not get in the way while you are ironing and the extra long cord is also very nice. I have also used it vertically to steam small items, and it works well.It's not a big issue, but I wish it would have an on/off switch. Plugging it in turns it on, and it does have an automatic shut-off.Compared to other irons I have used, this one is the best!!!"
4,ILS-Texas,Very pleased with the iron - light weight - does not stick - the best. I had an older one that finally gave it up after many years of service and this one is even better and improved over the old one. For the money this is the best iron and better then ones that cost much more.
4,iron,This iron is quite large and heavy. It does a good job after figuring out the very complicated buttons and dials. Not sure that I am there yet.
5,Excellent purchase,"This was the best purchase I made. It is lightweight and works really well. So easy to iron with and quick. I was a little skeptical at first always bought Rowenta. But, have had problems and didnt last long. I love this iron!!!"
1,VERY Disappointed!!!,"I bought this last year after reading good reviews about it. It runs way too hot, scorches clothing. It also does not steam good at all; spits water on clothing!"
5,great value,"I bought this iron based on the reviews. It is a great iron, makes ironing a breeze. Mix tap water with distilled water because the poor quality of water in Florida usually ruins the irons."
3,Very nice at first,"I use my iron once per week for approx 2 hrs on a stretch. It performed well for a good while and I must say I was pleased with its performance and capacity to hold enough water without having to refill too quickly. However this iron has lasted for just over one and a half years. Just this weekend it sparked smoked and that was the end of the iron. Not sure if I should, but I expected a longer life. The iron still looks brand new."
2,ironed well but lasted only 10 months before dying. . . .,I liked the way it ironed but it should last longer than 10 months. I do alot of ironing but still feel an iron should last longer.
5,T-Fal iron,"Although I don't enjoy ironing, the T-Fal iron makes this task less daunting. I recommend this iron - it glides smoothly and removes wrinkles quickly."
2,T-Fal loses steam,I purchased the T-Fal FV4379003 Ultraglide iron in September of 2010. In In January of 2012 it stopped producing steam.
1,Horrible Iron,"Absolutely horrible iron. I bought this after reading several of the more positive reviews and it seemed a fairly good deal (paying a bit more for a quality brand name).On a less drastic note, the iron has no middle ground between being so hot as to ruin the clothes and not hot enough to actually do its job. The steam function on the iron does not work at all.WORST of all, the iron actually LEAKS BOILING WATER while you use it. I was lucky enough to be wearing shoes while I ironed my shirts or the boiling water would have done more than just ruin the leather.Do not consider this product."
1,Leaks,"We replaced an old model T-fal that took years before it started leaking yellow water. The new iron feels more flimsy, it is heavier, makes tons of gurgling noise when vertical and leaks like crazy only 2 months after purchase.I regret not using it more intensively in the first month. I could have returned it to Amazon, but now it is too late.Will try T-fal customer service and update my review, but this is a big disappointment.The only nice thing about it is the soleplate, which glides easily and seems to be of the same old good quality as our previous iron."
1,Glides like sandpaper,"The ironing surface of this iron is not stainless steel. It is a painted surface. The first time I used it, it felt like I was running sandpaper over the fabric. And it does not get better over time. The surface also has white stripes painted on it to give the user the impression it might be teflon, but it is just paint. It also has the words ""ultra glide"" painted right on the ironing surface. All just marketing, but it does not glide. Another downside of this painted surface is that it does not transfer heat very well, so I could not get the wrinkles out of cotton fabric. Eventually I bit the bullet and got me a proper Rowenta iron. A bit more expensive, but oh, it is so much better. It works like a dream. After the first use of the Rowenta, I threw away this T-Fal, after only 3 months of use."
2,Cheap Iron,"I've owned this iron for 15 months; the amount of use has been infrequent, about once a month to iron a dozen items. The iron never has produced much, if any, steam at the middle and low heat settings. Recently started to leak through the steam holes when the iron is on the low setting. I will never purchase a product from this manufacturer again. The price on Amazon was comparatively low; now I know why."
2,First one lasted just 18 months,"Well, on my second one in just 18 months. We liked the first one since it was quite powerful, meaning it gets plenty hot (vs. some others we tried). Hope this one lasts longer...2 stars for longevity/durability."
1,not worth the money,"This iron is not worth the money, the cord is a big problem. The directions are very confusing and hard to follow."
4,To Large for my Ironing Board,"I bought this itemT-Fal FV4379 Ultraglide Easycord Nonstick Iron, Redbased on the Consumer Reports rating. We have a built in (Hide A Way) ironing board. I should have checked my space, and the Irons dimensions. I could not close the door on my ironing board cabinet because of the extra large heel plate on this Iron. Maybe this will help someone not make the mistake I did. Amozon was great with the return, they refunded the Iron and the shipping, Thanks."
4,Good so far,"I've only had this iron a couple of weeks but so far I am very pleased with its performance. It is really a little early to say how it will hold up long term. I replaced an iron that was in bad shape so anything would be an improvement. However, the reviews I read helped me to decide on the T-Fal Fv4379 Ultraglide. I will let you know."
5,A Great Steam Iron by T-Fal,"I purchased this Iron because of the non-stick Ultra-Glide surface and it has lived up to its name. The surface is truly amazing! In addition, the iron has excellent steam force that applies even steam to a garment. One small caution is to adjust the heat setting a little lower than you would normally set on other irons. For instance, if you are ironing cotton, set the heat dial lower than the cotton setting.The iron also has a large reservoir for water so that you do not have to fill it often. The steam has a self cleaning device in the water inlet to prevent clogging from lime build-up.You will love this iron. For the money you cannot go wrong."
4,Great iron!,"Just got it, so far so good. This is a great iron, especially if you love an iron with some serious steam power. I would definitely recommend this iron."
2,T-Fal FV4259003 Ultraglide Easycord Iron,"We had to return the iron because it didn't get hot enough. We were disappointed. However, Amazon's return policy is great and we had no problem returning the iron."
4,T-Fal Iron,"The iron was top rated by CU Reports, and in checking in the best buys, Amazon had it. So we went with them. The iron was as expected, except the directions were in such fine print as hard to read.We are still getting use to the iron; but it operates as indicated and expected. The purchase through Amazon was, as always, without a hitch. Am satisfied in all aspects. Recommend it to others. Would have done one star higher; but, have not had the time yet to so rate it. Amazon, though, is very, very good!"
4,T-Fal Iron Review,"The iron itself is of nice quality, the easy cord system is a unique feature and does in fact work. The steam this iron produces is much stronger than our old T-Fal iron. My only complaint is that this iron is somewhat loud, other than this little inconvenience, this is a great iron for the price."
5,Great for Quilters,I love this iron. It gets hot enough to nicely handle 100% cotton fabrics for my quilting. I use a lot of starch on my pieced quilting blocks and I've never had a problem in over a year with the steam vents getting clogged up with the starch. I highly recommend this to quilters. I use it almost everyday and it's still going strong.
2,Worst iron I ever purchased.,"I did a lot of research before purchasing an iron and I still made the wrong choice. I use my iron at high temp most of the time as I iron my husband's cotton dress shirts. The darn iron keeps turning off when it reaches its own temperature limit, it gets so cool I can touch the clothes and they're just warm, then finally kicks back on to give me some heat. I am getting a lot of water on the clothes, huge wet spots that I can't get to dry with the iron. The water has to be kept almost full to get a good burst of steam. The large base prevents me from using my iron holder and the easy cord system really doesn't protect the clothes from the cord, it just rubs the clothes in a different area. I do like the non stick plate, it's nice and smooth. If I had purchased this at a brick and mortar store, I would have returned it. I'll probably just give it to one of my kids that doesn't iron much and get myself a cheap model."
1,Leaks Like a Faucet,"I purchased this iron based on the good reviews it received from Consumer Reports, Consumer Search, and others. I was actually excited about getting what I thought would be a good, new iron, after using a broken down Black & Decker for a few months. The FIRST TIME I used it - it started spewing water through the bottom plate. I tried several heat/steam combinations, along with waiting for it to heat up properly and giving it time to reheat - all to no avail. And then good luck making sense of the 'CLICK"" diagram for the cord coming out of the iron. Again - I tried pushing the cord in and pushing the button and the reverse, to try and make it work, and it didn't. The button was useless. When I called the T-Fal toll free number - they generously offered to send me a shipping label to send it to a repair facility for warranty repair. I don't feel I should have a brand new iron 'repaired', let alone be out all of the time necessary for shipping. I should receive a new one."
4,T-Fal has a terrific surface for ironing. very smooth,"T-Fal has been a great iron, but I want to wait until I see how it stands the test of time. We do miss the retractable cord of our previous iron. Like the futuristic looks of the T-Fal. At this point if I were looking to purchase an iron I would buy the T-Fal FV4379 Ultraglide. I would drop the pitch about ""Easycord"" as we find it a bit cumbersome. Still like the iron overall."
4,good value,This iron produces a good voluum of steam and is very light to handle. It glides very smoothly. The heel is very wide and prevents tipping. The cord holder with it's extension is great for keeping the cord out of my way when ironing.
4,good product for the money,"glides effortlessly. since it's not heavy it doesn't do as good as the heavier irons, but for the money, it's a great product. and does not stick like pure stainless ones!"
2,OK but not Great!,This T-fal iron is not good if you need to do a lot of ironing it is not as efficient as the Rowneta irons.
1,leaks water,"Was great at ironing cloths, but started to leak water 1 week after receiving in the mail."
2,I had to give it away!,"Be careful! If you have a built-in ironing board in a cupboard on the wall, this iron is NOT for you. That is what I have, and the base is so wide that the iron will not fit on the shelf inside the cupboard. I didn't want to store the iron somewhere else away from the ironing board, so I gave it away. (I didn't know if I could return it since there was nothing wrong with it - it just didn't work for me.) Also, be aware that the cord is NOT the kind where you press a button and it automatically rolls up inside the iron. From the description, I thought it was. I think the cord on this is actually more of a pain to use than a normal cord!"
2,"Snap, Crackle, Pop","This item heated up well so for that I give it a 2; however, it was sooo loud. I don't mind the hissing sound of steam but having to put up with an actual steam roller pulling into dock was a bit much. I had to send it back."
3,Its Ok,"Its better than the D6000, which is pure junk, but does NOT come close to my D2030, which is perhaps the best iron that I have used.This iron is OK at wrinkles, but could be a lot better. My main problem is that it spits water and leaks at the most inopportune times. I did burn my first shirt, but I'll chalk that one on me because i did not clear the jets, but now it just drips water down and that sucks.Its ok for the money when compared to junk like the D6000 but it does leave a lot to be desired."
4,great iron,"folks, i believe you will love this iron, i do so far...it nice to look at, its 1700watts and makes a nice sound when its readly, or temp-reach.the other details can be found online and at amazon site."
3,A few flaws,You can't leave water in it for ironing at some point later in time - it will all just leak out in the meantime. It looks nice and glides nicely but I don't think its works as great as the reviews suggest.
2,handle pinches,"What I like about the Tfal is its ability to get hot fast and create steam and also the ease of filling the water tank.I do NOT like its handle. Where the colored part of the handle meets the white part there is a slight gap. After a very short time it starts to wear on your hand and if you have a lot of clothes to iron it becomes really annoying. I went back to my Rowenta because the handle feels much better. Apparently the engineer(s) that design this version were paying more attention to the steam and not how it felt to actually use the instrument. Bruce Amato , Vienna, VA USA."
4,T-fal Iron,"In the short time that I have been using the T-fal iron, I have been impressed with the smoothness of the soleplate, as well as the Easycord System. If there is a problem, it is in the instruction manual, which I found somewhat confusing. Actually, the manual makes the iron seem more complicated than it is. However, the Manual should be consulted in depth prior to use of the iron, and its precautions adhered to."
4,T-Fal Steam Iron,"I am very pleased with this steam iron. It really emits lots of steam and it is so lightweight that it's hard to imagine how it can do such a good job. The controls are easy to use and it fits in my hand very well. My only complaint it that the cord doesn't click into an upright position as it is supposed to. Other than that, I can heartily recommend this iron for ease of use and quality of features."
1,not for me,"my adored b&d iron died, and they discontinued the model. I read the reviews for the t-fal and thought that it might be a good replacement. I followed the instructions to clean out the water container first, and it immediately started leaking on me. It was also very light, which told me that I should've checked the weight. I was also rather irritated with the ""levels"" of heat... I want it to say 1,2,3... not dictate what kind of fabric I should use for what level, and have me presume how much heat will come out at that level. I immediately returned it."
3,good but,"Satisfied with the iron (T-Fal FV4259003 Ultraglide Easycord Iron with Scratch Resistant Nonstick Soleplate, Blue) but.... no English-language manual accompanied the shipment and attempts to obtain via T-Fal web site have been unsuccessful."
4,Excellent iron,"This iron has only two drawbacks that I have experienced so far. The color of the iron makes it difficult to see the water line and having to fill it while is flat is somewhat of an inconvenience. Occasionally I get some ""spitting"" when I first begin to use it. Overall, I rate it very high compared to other irons I have tried and returned. Black & Decker and Rowenta. I've spent much more for Rowentas in the past and they don't last that long. It does an excellent job of steaming. I've had T-Fal irons before and been extremely happy with them."
3,Too bulky,I like the sole plate on the iron but the handle is too bulky for me to hold and not get a fatigued hand within a couple of minutes. I have large hands but I found myself getting tired quickly. I then tried pushing the iron over the fabric but I was worryied about it flying off the ironing board. I am contemplating returning it for a refund.
3,Iron,"Not exactly a top of the line iron. It works fine, but it is not ""impressive"". I would have liked more balanced weight."
2,Returned it,"Make be OK iron but due to several issues, we returned it after trying it for two days.First note that there were no instructions in English (just Spanish) - did print English instructions from the website. Second, the steam performance seemed erratic. And finally, the handle had sharp edges where the blue and white plastic meets that was uncomfortable to my wife's small hand."
4,Great iron,"Couldn't give all the ""stars"" because I hate ironing so much, but it is a good iron -- doesn't leak and provides plenty of steam."
5,Puts out a lot of steam!!,"Bought this in Nov 09 after looking at Consumer Reports reviews of steam irons. Had previously owned a Black and Decker steam iron (was at least 10 years old) that finally gave out. Was immediately impressed the first time I used it. It puts out a ton of steam--far more than my old iron ever did. Will admit the instructions seem confusing or incomplete on what type of water to use. It recommended using tap water (but NOT softened water--which we have), and it recommended not using distilled water or bottled water. I ended up using mostly distilled, with some softened tap water mixed in, and so far that seems okay."
2,Disappointed in performance,"We have owned this iron for about 6 months. This is a hot iron and when it puts out steam it put out steam! Started out well enough, but soon developed bad habits. Steaming erratically, sticking to clothing, squirting water, etc. If the steam wasn't turned up enough in would stick real quick! My wife wasn't pleased about the sticking and always being worried about ruining clothing. If the sticking issue wasn't a factor this would be a good iron. The steam is noisy and blows out with a loud popping sound."
4,T-Fal iron,This iron is very nice. My only problem is the lack of clear instructions. There are pictures which are hard to decipher and limited words. I find this a problem with many items lately. I don't think I'm getting dumber but . . . .
4,"So Far, So Good",We've had the T-Fal for about one month and we are pleased with its performance. We weren't too sure what to think based on many of the reviews we read. So at this point we would have to give it a positive rating.
5,T-Fal Ultraglide,"I had 3 Rowenta Irons prior to this, they always leaked, stuck to clothes (coating was always wearing off the bottom) and had very little steam. I'm glad I decided to try the T-Fal. It has plenty of steam (I don't have to keep pushing a button to get steam), when I pour water in the spout it doesn't gurgle out like the Rowentairons. T-Fal was a great choice and is rated no. 1 by Consumer Products."
1,Leaks water badly,Leaks water badly since I first bought it. Contacted the company and they told me to fill it with bottled spring water -- seriously? My iron is not getting better water than me!! Grr.
2,Poor performance,This product does not live up to the good name the brand carries.It is the most frustrating appliance I have ever owned to date.When ironing it takes a while to get hot and when it finally does you can count on the appliance to drip water all over the garment.Im very disappointed and dissatisfied with the item since I expected so much from the brand.
4,Better than I had,"I have had more problems with irons leaking, and this one seems to be better than the prior ones I have had, although they did not leak at first either, it was after I used them a while, anyway I have had this over a month and so far I am very satisfied with it."
3,Buyer beware,"Thought I was ordering the blue option of model FV4379 as the red was temporarily out of stock. It did come in at a few dollars less, however, it isn't the same model. The blue option is model FV4259. Not nice Amazon. I am keeping it because returns are too bothersome and I need an iron today."
2,Steam iron,"Even though Consumer's Report rated this iron highly, I do not like it.It, like most irons today, does not get hot enough for 100% cotton.No matter what I do, I can't get the wrinkles out."
2,Not Dripless,"I have had a lot of trouble finding a steam iron that I think has sufficient steam. This T-Fal iron has abundant steam, but it claims to be dripless. Not only does it steam, it dripped all over the place. I followed the instructions in the owners manual for what to do when the dripping occurred. It didn't help. I was very disappointed and returned the iron and bought a Kenmore. It doesn't steam quite so profusly, but it doesn't drip either."
5,Cuts ironing time in half.,"I have always hated ironing so I never spent more than $10 for an iron. However the older I get I'm noticing the wrinkled jean look isn't for every occasion & my low cost irons just don't cut it. This iron is great. When I iron pants the steam penetrates through the top leg all the way to the second. The steam burst is constant & never gives out. The water reservoir is huge. I have not had to stop mid ironing & re-fill it yet. Plus, the non stick plate simply glides over fabrics even on the highest heat setting. I'm very happy with this purchase. Now if I can only find an ironing board that doesn't suck.."
5,Best Iron Ever,"I had the older version of this iron years ago. My mother wanted one after using mine and I was able to find one for her. We wore them out and could not find a T-Fal anywhere. When I saw them on Amazon I clicked ""order now"" pretty fast. The iron I had still worked but I started using this one right away. I was not disappointed. It gets hot enough, has plenty of steam and it truly glideslike it is waltzing over my clothes. I want to buy another to have on hand when I wear this one out! Thanks Amazon!"
1,T-Fal Iron,"Received iron and began to use, out of the box, only to find it spits and sputters, LOUDLY and while ironing a pink, expensive golf shirt, it puked brown water stains, ALL over it. BUYER BEWARE! Returning for a refund."
4,Works for me!,"The grounding and centering information in this book makes sense on so many levels. If only more people would ground and center before they get in their vehicles, imagine how much different driving on I-5 would be!I recommend this book to everyone. Once they read it, perhaps more objective reviews can be posted.We all still have the right to choose, so exercise your right to buy this book. Or not. If you choose to buy it, you may be surprised at how little you spent to learn so much."
5,Thank You Nashville!,"As a fan of the Moody Blues since Justin Hayward's arrival in the 60ies, I could not imagine this album,though noble in its intent, actually working. Hats off to the Nashville muscians and singers who created this tribute! It is a wonderful production of an equally wonderful inspiration. It also proves truly superior lyrics and music can be performed in a style enhancing these timeless songs once again, and done so in a style complimenting the Nashville professionals responsible for this outstanding treatment of these Moody Blues classic songs. This is a must have production whether one is or is not a Moody Blues fan! Some folks in Nashville really have their heads on straight for this one!!"
2,Dull bluegrass versions of Moody Blues songs,"This bluegrass tribute to the Moody Blues is not a sacrilege and it doesn't desecrate that band's legacy, like some of the negative reviews claim.What it does show is that the Moodies songs don't translate well to the bluegrass genre. Taken as a whole, this CD is boring with no highlights or surprises to speak of."
1,Not worth the money to pay for something awful,"I would not buy this CD. In my opionion no one has ever been able to sing or play a Moody Blues song that sounded right or close to the orginal. I don't care if they put their own twist on the song. This CD is a butcher of the Moody Blues songs, that made them famous. When you have someone else doing a remake to a popular song it never sounds right. Thats why I don't like remakes to older songs."
4,Delightful renditions,"I was pleasantly surpirsed with this CD. I don't know why because it has an excellent cast of bluegrass musicians and singers. They have managed to put their own interpretations to the songs while remaining true to the Moody Blues. I especially like the ballads but the uptempo tunes work very well with the mandolins, banjos and fiddles. The vocals are strong on all the cuts. Highly recommended."
5,Can't keep the smile off my face,"If you're a Moody Blues fan, get this album. If you're a bluegrass fan, get this album. If, like me you're both...well, I think you know the answer. This is a masterpiece. You would swear these songs were written for this style of playing, so good are the arrangements and performances. Great songs can take being stretched into new incarnations, and this album proves these are great tunes. The love and care these musicians show the music and the superb playing makes this an utter joy to listen to. The only misstep for me is including Late Lament...bad poetry is bad poetry, no matter what style of music surrounds it! Other than that, this reshaping of Moody Blues music is sheer perfection."
2,bought by mistake,I actually bought this book by mistake. I thought it was the actual one written by C.S. Lewis.It has some amount of interesting information in it. But I am quite unhappy as to the title.
3,NOT the original album!,"Although they have appropriated the picture from the original Design LP (Tijuana Christmas), this MP3 download version has added in a chorus of singers that were never on the original album. This transforms the original -- and very good -- album from being reminiscent of The Tijuana Brass to being somewhat like The Ray Conniff Singers. (I'm being charitable; I don't think the singers on these MP3s are as good as the Ray Conniff Singers.)It's not necessarily a bad album; I do like Ray Conniff's Christmas album as well as the Tijuana Brass' Christmas album, so they could have done worse. But for anyone who may be looking to replace their old Tijuana Christmas LP, these MP3s are a severe disappointment, and they should not have used the same cover picture--it's very misleading.Note also that there are 4 songs here that were not on the LP, and two songs that were on the LP are not part of the MP3 album."
3,Nice but not original,"I was wanting a MP3 version of this album....I have the original Christmas album here but there are no singers on it, it is supposed to be instrumental. The singers are great singers, don't get me wrong....but if you only want original, this is not it. Would get a 5 star rating if it really was the original."
4,Quality Blowdryer,"OK my hair is like a sponge...it takes FOREVER to blowdry using my Conair 1875 watt dryer and I wanted to upgrade but couldn't afford to break the bank to do so...so for the price, I am quite happy with my Babyliss...it drys my hair in 10 minutes flat which is awesome. So although not spectacular, it is a huge improvement to what I had previously...but not sure if its the wattage increase or the blowdryer or both."
2,Not what you would expect,"The product is not designed very well with the switches on the side of the handle. It is a little heavier than expected and doesn't dry as well as some others. Although it was pretty inexpensive, it wasn't what we needed and decided to buy something else."
3,Not bad,"I enjoyed the video, however it was also the only version that I could find in Spanish. The animation was a little cheesy and the dubbing was off in places."
4,THANKS AMAZON,"Im very glad for using amazon.Books were in excelent condition,not to mention delivery was fast and easy.I recomend amazon to every one."
4,Quality,"It is a good quality to read. There are friendship, responsibility, and adventure in this book."
5,The Lord of te Rings,"The Lord of the Rings is a great Fantasy tale! No other Fantasy story can even compare to compete with J.R.R Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings. This story is about A Hobbit named Frodo, he bears a Magical ring that the Lord Sauron Desires above all mortal things. With this ""Fellowship of the Ring"" goes Aragorn, Gandalf, Merry, Pippin, Legolas, Gimli and Sam. There Journey begins in the all to familiar land of the Shire. Gandalf sets the stage for Frodo to take the ring into a Dreaded place on Middle-Earth called Mordor. This is conciderded a Trilogy by some, but others it is a Novel of Great leangth, but whatever Tolkien intened it to be it turned out a Great book! If you havent read this book it is a must read for all ages."
5,Wonderful!,"I had to read the Hobbit for a school assignment and simply hated the thought. I finished the book a week before i was supposed to and started the LOTR. I am crazy for more books. I feel a connection with the characters and am dying to see the next 2 movies. I have 3 words to say: Buy the books! I just can't blabber on and on, so I'll stop now, but buy them! they are worth it!"
5,Lord of the Rings Boxed set,"These books are AMAZING! About the time I got to The Return of the King, I could not put the book down. What an adventure!"
5,Lord of the Rings,"My grandson was thrilled to get this for Christmas. He kept taking the books out of the box and putting them back in, because he couldn't wait to start reading them. I've been a huge Tolkien fan for many years. I hope he enjoys Middle Earth as much as I have for all these years."
3,lord of the ring,"The books are in good shape, but they are very yellowed for the price. They shipped quickly. They are a great read for all ages."
5,Simply the greatest fantasy ever written.,"this series really is the greatest series ever composed. its short, sweet, and mesmorizing. tolkien was and always will be the foremost fantasy writer of all time. in just 4 books, he was able to tell a rich and compelling tale, full with action, emotion, and intrigue."
2,I pity those who have read it...,"No, really it deserves a 10 -- just wanted to get your atention. I read the trilogy 3 times now, and was disappionted my second and third time around. I found more the next time, but I did not get that ""feeling"" like the first time I read the book. I wish I did not read it, this way I could read it for the first time again. Read it and you will understand."
5,"The BEST ""book"" I've ever read.",* STARS!!! I finished the Lord of the rings a month ago and I loved it!! I have never read such great works! Tolkien is the almighty fantasy master!!! I am reading everything Tolkien now!!!!! READ THIS NOW!!!!!! IF ANYBODY SAYS THAT THERE ARE BETTER AUTHORS THEY ARE LYING!!!!
5,The Best,"I was first read The Hobbit six years ago at age 10 by my fifth grade teacher and at age 12 I had finished The Lord of the Rings and was ready to start it all over again. I have read the trilogy numerous times since then and each time is as fulfilling as the last. The story is just so that a younger reader can understand it and an older reader can dive into its intricities and uncover new meanings. Tolkien created a world almost as complex in its history and tradition as our own, complete with original languages and letters or runes. The characters' humanity is apparent despite their strange forms and ways. I have read other fantasy novels that have been compared to Tolkien, and while I enjoy the other novels, I am yet to read something that can came close to the mastery of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings."
4,"If you want a good, long read, this is one of the best.","J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the masters of Fantasy, and one of the best writers of our time. Anyone who hasn't read this books should. And for anyone has read them, but a while ago, pick them up and read them again. Like I said, they are long, and for most readers it will take two or three months but the time is well worth it. You couldn't buy a better set of books, unless you buy Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time(those that are finished) and maybe some of David Eddings works"
5,A Great Read,This book will suit either confirmed fans of The Lord of The Rings or the newcomer. A greater way to be introduced to Middle Earth. If you've got kids this would be the best introduction for them.
4,Classic but ......maybe could have been abbridged just a bit,Never read it as a teen liked it alot for a while but droned a bit in the middle. Off to see the movie soon.
5,"MAGNIFICENT , it takes your breath away!!!",I am happy to be in the group of people on this earth who have read the Lord of the Rings.
5,I didn't want it to finish,"Right from the first humble phrases to the stunning climix, this collection has everything that any reader could ever want from a written work. The wealth of characters, their vivid descriptions and incredible scenarios is just one area in which this compiliation is superior to all others. There is not a single dull moment and I was constantly pondering future events. Without a doubt, there is nothing that hails near to ""The Lord of the Rings""."
1,Avoid This Edition,"This one star rating applies only to the cheap and tawdry presentation of this edition.Tolkein's novels are obviously towering classics of modern world literature. They should be read slowly, treasured, and read over and over again.This edition is not at all suitable for such reverential handling. It would be fine for throwaway pulp fiction - but not for a great masterpiece such as LOTR.The paper is cheap, rough, and unpleasant to the touch. Typography suffers as the characters bleed into its overly absorbent surface. This makes the already small font even more difficult to read.The layout is crowded, the cover art mundane (taken from the movies), and maps of Middle Earth, which every reader will want to consult along the way, are very shabbily rendered.I was embarrassed to have inadvertently purchased something so deficient as a gift. I apologized to the recipient when I saw it, and quickly replaced it.Don't make the same mistake."
5,What Can I Say!,What can I say about Tolkien except that he either lived these stories in a previous life or is one of the most gifted and imaginatively creative authors that will ever be. I like to believe it's a little of both. All that needs to be said about these novels is that I am utterly disappointed that I will never have the joy of reading them again for the first time.
5,"Still the best after 7, no 8 readings!","I first read The Hobbit when I was 11, and I've been reading it and the other books in the set off and on ever since. It is definitely a book set I would recommend, if not for the definitive writing style of Tolkien, then for the sheer joy of reading it. I figure that if this book can get some of my friends to read who haven't picked up a book seriously without a homework assignment, then it must be an excellent story."
5,"Amazing Edition, good quality!","This edition (release september 18 2012) is great. Even though the paper is somewhat of a cheap quality, the printing quality is flawless I read the hobbit cover to cover and I have no complaints whatsoever on translations, mistakes, misspellings, etc... The quality of the cover is outstanding, it has some very special feeling when you grasp it with your fingers and it seems to have a long life. The only thing I didn't like was that at the end of the hobbit there is the first chapter of the fellowship, which is, of course, a very minor issue for me."
2,Weird,"When I read The Fellowship of the Ring , I found it boring because J R R Tolkien spent ages in the forest with Tom Bombadilo and his dodgy hat. I don't know what happens next because I stopped reading then. I am now reading the two towers and are finding it good( probably because I have seen the first film)"
1,stupid and racist,"the orcs in this book are clearly racist. They are ""swarthy"" orcs or they have ""slant eyes."" Hmmmmm...sounds like negroes and chinamen to me. Tolkien was a linguist he based the orc language on the ZULU language, that proves he was racist. Also he was a nazi during second world war.......all of the elfs are Aryan.....lord of the rings is nazi. It is a racist book."
3,Good but overrated,Tolkien created a nifty setting and an entire genre. But the novels themselves drag and read unevenly. The Peter Jackson movies were much better.
1,Don't make me march!,"If you read Tolkien and enjoy it, then you are blind to racism. I'm not going to sit back some lazy saturday morning Clark and enjoy a story I live everyday! Wake up people! Drive outside the suburbs you live in and open those eyes. Big Daddy T---See you in the hood. Clark---No justice no peace."
1,This is the real World!,"Clarke S. wake up! This is the real world. Do you really believe that it just so happens that black represents evil and white represents good and pureness? This book stinks of racism like your favorite safe haven after 10 out-of-the-closet poopers have struck. Tolkien is a christian intolerant racist. He and C.S. Lewis have devised these books to oppress us. It's easy for you to ""get lost"" in these books because you are probably a white dude, who wears glasses, has an easy office job, and drives a red sports car. For the rest of us who have to face the real world on a daily basis, it's not so easy to forget the very real evils of this world."
3,Well...,"This is a wonderfully written book but I did not find it very interesting. The story seemed to be told from an outsider's perspective. As such it was epic and universal in scale, but the characters were intricate cardboard. They moved through the book without thinking much. I prefer books with more psychological and philosophical flavor. The story in and of itself means nothing. This is a grand and great story, but nothing else. When I finnished reading the book, I thought it would make an excellant screenplay, and through Peter Jackson's interpretation it did. After all the book spends just as much time explaining the characters as it does explaing the trees, mounds, and hillocks. Perfect for a movie!"
1,Boring Boring,"People seem to like this book whether they are regular readers of fantasy or not... but I will never understand why. Maybe there is a bit of a story in it - but it is certainly not worth spending the amount of time this book takes to read on it... it is unbelievably boring and overly descriptive in the worst possible way (and I usually do like description). But this is wretched. And no I am not just lacking in good taste or ""maturity"". Perhaps there ARE things to admire about this book... but it is a very very boring read. And overrated by far."
5,Great Value,"Books are in proper condition, shipped quickly. EXCELLENT VALUE! Probably not for collectors, but can't beat the deal. Would highly recommend!"
5,perfect lord of the rings and the hobbit set,I received this box set of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit books in good time and have thoroughly enjoyed reading them. My books came in perfect condition and have brought hours of entertainment already.
4,Hobbit & LOTR Trilogy,"The books were in average condition. They had no markings, no dog-eared pages, or other defacements excepting the broken spines, which were anticipated. They were advertised as having a box for storage as well, however, the box had to be cut to lay flat for shipping, and was unable to be adequately restored. Nevertheless, even without the use of the box, the price for the set of 4 books was still outstanding! The shipping cost was reasonable and customary; the speed of shipping was average. It was not as rapid as I had hoped, taking about 12 days until receipt; however, it was within the delivery window that I had been given. Overall, my experience was the the product was average, with average shipping times and costs, but had a GREAT price, despite the box being unusable."
4,The Hobbit,I would give The Hobbit 4 stars.It is a great book by J.R.R.Tolkien.It is the prelude to the Lord of the Rings.It is about a hobbit named Bilbo that is chosen by a wizard to go on an aventure(hobbits are not very aventureous).He goes along with 13 dwarves and the wizard.The wizard is not with him and the dwarves the whole time though.I think that kids and adults would both like this book.ALso if you like aventure and magic books.
5,The best book you will ever read in your mortal life,"The lord of the rings is the best book I've ever read. It's an epic adventure; but strangely, one that isn't so fantastic that you can't believe. It's a story that, inside it's fantasy world, Is actally kinda easy to believe. The caracters are wonderful, the story, amazing, and the world in which Tolkien places this adventure, incredibly complete. I won't ever read a book as good a this in my life unless I clone Tolkien back."
5,Fantasy,"In the book ""The Lord of the Rings"" a Hobbit named Frodo sets out on a quest of extreme imprtance. He is to destroy the master ring, the ring that could give one man all the power of Middle-Earth. He leaves with his Friends (Merry,Pippin, Samwise and meets his friend Gandalf along the way) No other Writer could have put more detail into this book than J.R.R. Tolkien. He makes the Characters come alive! This book is the First book i have ever been Sad to be over. When you finish reading the Lord of the Rings you will be wishing that J.R.R. Tolkien had made another!"
4,Lord of the rings,"It's the best ring of all but, who is going to destort it? I really liked this book, it was one of my favorite books. It was about a small man and a couple of his friends that helped him on his journey to destroy the ring. There were evil demans that were trying to kill him and take the ring. If you want to know the rest read it. I would recommend this book to some one who likes fiction boks."
2,DISAPPOINTING DRAMATIZATION OF A MASTERPIECE,"IF YOU LOVE THE BOOKS, YOU WILL NOT BE PLEASED BY THE DRAMATIZATION HERE. TOLKIEN TAKES YOU INTO THE JOURNEY AND INTO THE STORY WITH HIS BOOKS. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS SET OF AUDIO BOOKS IS SOMEWHAT COMICAL. THE VOICES DO NOT MATCH THE CHARACTERS, THE SOUND EFFECTS BRING NO LIFE TO THE TALE. THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE TAKES AWAY FROM THE FANTASY, WHICH IS SO EASILY ENTERED THROUGH TOLKIEN'S BOOKS. I'M STILL SEARCHING FOR THE BEST WAY TO CLOSE MY EYES AND LIVE IN TOLKIENS AMAZING WORLD. I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN/IF I FIND IT HERE."
2,Give Me A Break!,"HAHAHA. This book is a joke. All they ever talk about is food. Man this hobbit dude ain't no hero he is like a total pig. 1 of his super hero friends fight 20 goblins and they get hurt almost to the point of death but they are healed in an instant. No death at all. J.R.R. tolkein let all of his charachters get hurt but never died. He should have done daring escapes or gorey fights but no, they get healed every second by a plant that only grows in that part and they have enough luck to find it. A group of 12 can kill everybody in their path. It was probably like 200 people they killed but none of them got killed. Classic?"
1,hated this,"I know there are a ton of people that think these books are the greatest, I don't. Some of the worst writing ever and the movies were just as bad."
3,Snore,"What's so good about these books? The Hobbit is a likeable children's fairy tale, with some good characterization and entertaining scenes. But LOTR is just completely up itself. It could have been cut down to half its length and would still be dull. The plot is okay, and there are some decent scenes (like Weathertop, and the final ring-destroying scene) but the majority is simply boring. Not much of interest ever happens, and any big battles that take place are so badly written that they are completely boring. I did finish the books eventually, but I wish I hadn't. Yawn. Don't bother.(to all those who say Tolkein is a genius - get your head checked. He's an average author, and fantasy is easy to write)"
3,I'm Glad I Finally Finished!,"I don't want to write a long review on ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (I feel like I have wasted enough time on them already).I liked ""The Hobbit"" for the most part and the first book in ""The Lord of the Rings"" was not too bad, but from there it was all downhill, in my opinion.This was just a wordy, long series of books that I never thought I would end. During the last two books of ""The Lord of the Rings"" I thought I was going to lose my sanity.This series should have been cut in half to two books, and even then it would probably be dull in parts.If you are thinking of reading these books, I would say go ahead and try it if you are known for endurance and perseverance.If you're not, go buy the Cliff Notes or just wait for the movies."
1,bad books,I just cannot understand why so many people like this set of books! I read the first two and then read the last two so I could review this book set. This is the worse fantasy set I have ever read and I'm 54!
5,a great boxed set of a classic story,"These four books are easily the best I have ever read in my so far short life (12 years). Yes, im only 12, and no, im not a straight-A's high school reading geek. my dad recomended these books to me, and Im glad he did. I recently finished the story. You really dont need to read the hobitt, although I did, it doesnt have that much to do with the actual lord of the rings story. the first book in the series explains all you need to know. as a matter of fact, in the first book you can get extremely bored during the first couple chapters. there is very little fighting in the first half of the book. In the second half, from there and on, the story just takes off with non-stopping action. The first sentence in the second book is action! BUY THIS! it is worth every single penny."
1,The quality of these books is aweful,"No, I'm not referring to Tolkien (of course!). The reading content is fantastic. However, I recommend you not buy the boxed set printed by Houghton Mifflin. I've only read my copies twice and the pages are already falling out of the spine. These are put together very badly. Pay a little more and buy the hardcover if you plan on re-reading (and you will, trust me)."
5,Lord of The Rings - The King of Fantasy,"As a child, I grew up on the cartoons of 'The Hobbit' and the 'Lord of the Rings'. In middle school, I read Tolien's 'The Hobbit', but never delved into the trilogy that followed. Now, I am student teaching, as I am soon to graduate with a degree in Middle Grades Language Arts and Social Studies - I have awoken the sleeping Tolkien. I pulled out my dusty box set with the four books and began rereading them for my adolescent literature class. Here I quickly realized how timeless these tales are. When I found out the movies were coming out for 'Lord of The Rings', I picked up 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and could not set it down. I have since finished the trilogy only to be engulfed in a new and wonderful world. The story of good, evil, and innocence in their purest forms. It is entrancing, and I highly recommend these books to any fan of fantasy."
5,exactly what i wanted but in better condition than expected,"I got the exact set that is pictured, which is what my mom read to me as a kid, and I paid less than $5! Considering it is almost as old as i am, and has very little damage (a little spine wear) i'm delighted! Maybe the other person who reviewed this had a bad seller? We recently reading this as a family. My kids (10 and 8)even love it!"
1,Disappointed,Paper is thin and cheap and the print is tiny. My head ached big time when I tried reading the first book.
4,Good deal,"Item arrived in excellent condition. Product as described. Only thing I'd say is I wish i had paid attention to the book size and realized how small the print was going to be. Other than that, it is a very economic choice for this book set."
4,loved it,bought these for my son and he read them all within 6 months. I highly recommend the series to any avid reader of fantasy fiction.
5,The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings,"These 4 marvellous books are the best fantasy, sci-fi i have ever readThe books give you a magical feeling when read them, it is like being there with Bilbo, Frodo and GrandalfThese books are very imaginative to the eyes of many people like myself. I encourage anyone who likes fantasy or has read a Tolkein book, the Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings is MUST!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I never grow tried of reading these books.,"I read these books as a teenager and enjoyed them, but it was until I sat down and read them complete that truely enjoyed them. Now I'm not a Tolkien worshipper, sometimes I find it drags in spots, but it was definetly worth a long weekend. The books have been edited for a number of years now which gives Lord of Rings unfair advantage when compared to the writers of today, but it is a great refference manually for character developement and story continuity. Frodo was definetly my favorite character, read it and enjoy one of the truely unheroric heros."
5,AWESOME! FANTASTIC!,THESE ARE THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVERREAD IN MY SHORT 10 YEARS OF LIFE. HOW TOLKIEN DECRIBES THE CHARACTERS AND THE SETTINGS IS JUST FANTASTIC!
4,"A long swim, but worth it!","I was first introduced to LotR by a friend when I was in High school. I read it twice over since the first time, and have always come away with the same impression. These booka are a heavy read ... but well worth it. I pits the most unlikely heroes against deep dark forces thatthreaten to overwhem to world.If you are a person who expects to understand everything you read, you will be sorely disappointed, because there are many references to a mythology upon which these stories are based that is never fully explained.In the end, good triumphs over evil, and the world is finally at peace, and you are left with a peaceful, satisfied feeling after reading it."
5,5 stars!!!!! Thats as high as i can go?!!,"OK. this is my second review to write on this book!! I'm sick of how many people say this book is horrible! i am 13 and have read it twice! the books are great. Tolkien created a world that one one else will ever be able to do. Just listen to this:Three rings for the elven-kings under the skyseven for the dwarf lords in there halls of stonenine for the mortal men doomed to dieone for the dark lord on his dark throneIn the land of Mordor where the shadows lieone ring to rule them all, one ring to find themone ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind themIn the land of mordor where the shodows lieIsn't that Awsome?!! these books ARE THE BEST OUT THERE!!! NOTHING EVER HAS OR MOST LIKELY NEVER WILL BE BETTER!!!you just have to get these books."
5,"Truely Magical, The father of the fantasy genre.","The Lord of the Rings is my favorite book of all time. It is a beautifully discriptive epic with so many themes which creates in the mind not just pictures but masterpieces of the world Tolkien created. On the one hand it is simply the classic tale of Good versus evil with the good triumphing against all odds. It is also about how the great and strong with all their power are helpless in the face of great danger, must rely someone apparently weak, it shows how everyone has hidden depths. It is a tale of great friendship and loyalty especially between Frodo & Sam, it shows how we all need friends. The charater of Aragorn shows how we must look beyond appearances. With Golum we can see how even those we regard as evil can still have good in them. There are darker themes too, Boromir and Saruman are examples of how temptation of power can ruin us. There are many more than this but I think I've made my point."
5,A family read,"As others have said before me, this is a truly inspired work. Rather than reiterate the 400 previous posts, I'll just say this is a book the will create a thirst for reading in a child. I would strongly suggest reading the Hobbit to your young ones, and then letting them read the rest of the series on their own. These are the only books I have read more than twice and it certainly got me away from just reading comic books. Enjoy!"
5,The best fantasy series ever!!!,"Tolkein creates a magical world where anything and everything can happen. Whenever I need a vacation, but can't leave, I just start reading these books. I would recommend them to all fantasy lovers."
1,I shouldnt have wasted my time,"I bought this in an audio CD, complete waste of money. the story doesnt flow, it was supposed to be unabriged, it was. It sounds like it was edited with a chain saw. several scenes didnt make sense causing your brain to come to a screeching halt, The tolkien version is a wonderful read, this is just a very sad imitaition"
5,"Oh, what else can one say: it's the best","If you try it that is. I know a lot of people who shudder at the tought of reading an 1000 pages long book filled with ancient genealogies, people with unpronouncable names and strange creatures. Well, they don't know what they're missing, this book is undoubtebly one of the all time greats of world literature. This is the original, without tis one no Harry Potter, no Pratchett, probably even no things as Stephen King or a whole load of other stuff. I you haven't already read him now is the time cause even if the movie is great, this is still so much better.PS: Hobbits rule supreme"
5,Best books ever written...but not for the faint of heart,Excellent books best read with tea and wintry evenings by the fire. Leads you into a world filled with all the components that every book should have including the language rich in texture and imagination. Once read you view your own world with different eyes-enjoy=:)
2,Warning! Product not as shown! (Product picture fixed),"... it is a cheesy ""movie edition"" covered in photos from the movie. Each side of the box features a large photo of a character from the movie (Frodo, Sauron?? and the Ranger). Also each book, except the Hobbit, also has movie photos on the cover, spine and back. Frodo on the first book, sauron on the second and the Ranger on the third. The Hobbit actually has a nice drawing/painting on the cover of Gandalf walking in the shire toward Bilbo's house but ont he back it reads ""THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS NOW AN EPIC MOTION PICTURE TRILOGY FROM NEW LINE CINEMA"".Some may say the content inside is all that matters, which is mostly true, but if given a choice between a movie edition and a regular edition I would easily choose the regular edition."
4,The Best of Tolkien,"Great series purchased for my son at Christmas. He loves to watch movies instead of reading, but these books have really kept his interest. Of course they can...it's Tolkien!"
4,speedy delivery,"The books were very quickly delivered and in the original packaging seal. The corner of the box was slightly damaged, but nothing major and the books were mint. The am enjoying this edition so far. The quality of the banding and pages is quite good for the price."
3,Not appealing to all.,"I wasn't impressed by the books. In fact, I couldn't get into the first one and never got deep into the set. I still have kept the collection due to the credit behind the books and the author - for if my children would fine interest in them. They were not fit for me though. I am not sure if having seen the movies first may have been a factor but I do believe it is best to first start reading part of a book before committing to buy as not all will appeal you. I would not advise this item for a collector either as it is very basic in design and would be best suited for someone just wishing to read the book (and obviously buy it)."
1,Overrated!,"This is quite simply the most boring, overrated series of books I've ever seen. Classic situations and characters, but incredibly dull writing. Oh, well, different strokes..."
3,"A story for the ages, presented much more efficiently in the film version","I found the Lord of the Rings to be a chore to read. The prose is good and of course the universe is unbelievably rich, but the structure is clumsy. There are many instances where the book bogs down with long-winded songs and lengthy descriptions of travel through fairly dull terrain--like the Barrow Downs and Frodo and Sam meandering their way into Mordor. I know those things go toward universe-creation, but they're still boring.Peter Jackson's film adaptation is the definitive pathway into Middle Earth for me. It has all of the substance and none of the fat. But that being said, if you haven't read the books or seen the movies, try to slog your way through the books before seeing the movies. You'll appreciate the movies a lot more than you would otherwise."
4,Capturing story with a lack of female,"Tolkien is before his time with this enormous fairy tale story. 'The hobbit' in itself I enjoyed as a stand alone story because it was funny and careless but thrilling and capturing at the same time. The next book is somewhat more heavy to start off with but as soon as you have passed through the introductory pages then the story takes you along even further into this world of imaginative creatures that is very much alive and sucks you in until the very last page of the last book of the series. The one thing that annoys me is the absence of women in the stories - with one or two exeptions, every character in the story is male. This is I guess what you would expect from a story this old but it is still a disappointment."
5,"unique, one-of-a-kind, my precious","These stories can't really be compared to any others. Some readers of more modern fantasy works often find them lacking and somewhat old fashioned. Personally, most fantasy novels bore me to tears. How many different variations can you come up with on Elves, Wizards, magic swords, etc.? All of them owe some debt of gratitude to Tolkiens works and, in my opinion, none come close to them in impact. They not only deserve a single reading, they inspire and demand a re-visiting every couple of years. Each time I read them I dread arriving at the last page, knowing that the experience is over again."
5,IT'S THE BEST EVER!!,"I'm only 11, but I've read lots of books and this one's the best. The details in it are awsome. J.R.R. Tolkien is the best if you like fantasys mysterys or any kind of book read these."
2,Boring...You just get stuck,"I have read the books and I found it a waste of my time. I also talked to friends about it. Of 10 people asked if they actually got throught the whole book, only 3 did! Why, because everyone else either gets bored after the council of elron, or whatever, or at the council! I myself got stuck at the damn council! It took me months to get pass it!Listen, want to know the trilogy (And I don't say this often, because I love to read) GO WATCH THE MOVIES! They are well done and pretty close to the story!Going back on the last note, the book does have some great points. One such thing is some characters that play interesting roles are not in the movie. That is the only reason I liked the books, all the missing characters!Sorry if I'm ruining your reading experience!If your a big Tolken fan, have fun! This is the book for you! Else, stay away!"
5,Detail! Detail! Detail!,"These books by Tolkien were extremely, and richly detailed. A fantasy world that captures your imagination and holds it throughout the course of the book. Very imaginative characters."
5,THIS YOU MUST READ,From these books grew all that was to become todays vast fantasy genra. They lay the foundations for nearly all of the storys that come after them. Beyond that the writing is some of the best there is and the story is simply amazing. Harken to my words and read these. You will not regret it.
2,Very poor edition,"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and The Hobbit are fantastic books that are well worth reading, but this edition is rather pathetic. First off, the type is very small and difficult to read and the books are very difficult to open. Also, these are the commercialized version where none of Tolkien's original vision is seen on the cover. I prefer the editions where the reader can see how Tolkien viewed Middle Earth as oppose to Hollywood's version. To put it simply, I didn't buy the books to see Hollywood plastered on the cover, I have the DVDs for that. This is a very poor edition, not very readable. Cheap, but not worth the money. Buy a different edition!"
4,"Good books, poor cover art","Great books. Font can be difficult to read on some pages and the cover art is garbage in my opinion. But the maps, forwards and other extra stuff at the beginning of the books add to it and I rated 4 stars just because of the small size it takes up, the way they are held together nicely in the case, and because the stories are remarkable no matter how bad the cover art is."
5,All others pale by comparison,"Lord of the Rings is the singular achievement of the century. I've read many fantasy books, and been disappointed by many of them, but I've never been disappointed by Tolkien. What else can I say that hasn't already been said. Buy it, read it, treasure it always."
3,Reader only,"This set is just the paperback books. The maps are pretty much useless. If you are only interested in reading and not referencing maps or seeing any illustrations, and want a set that is portable, then this is the set for you. We bought this as an introduction for our son, and wish we would have just gone to the bookstore to look at them first."
5,The real thing,"Forget Harry Potter; forget the cheesey alien books. Tolkien is the grandfather of all fantasy and can not be matched.Yes, these books can be a little dark and scary. But the lessons clearly taught are valuable. Each person is important and valuable. Team work gets things done. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. And even the smallest of the smallest people can make a difference in the world.For younger readers, start off with C.S. Lewis. But junior highers and older can handel this. I even reccommend it for adults. Make it your summer reading."
2,Good book but pretty racist in an ignorant way,"Okay, Okay, I read through every other review and saw maybe 10 reviews that gave this series less than 5 stars and a couple of those reviews were just attention grabbers. I give this book only two stars because it is racist. I just read the Chronicles of Narnia a similar set of allegorical fantasy books with racist undertones. Both series deal with enemies (called calormenes in the chronicles and i-can't-remember-what in the rings) that have dark skin, while the good guys have blond hair and fair skin. They are the same sort of racism found in Aladdin. If I remember there is even an incident where the enemies are called ""darkies"" in Chronicles. I recommend these books if you can get pass the ignorant racism that unfortunatly detracts from otherwise great series."
3,the return of the king,"basically, it was boring. the writing, while expressive, was lacking. there wasn't a single action scene worth reading. It was, well, dead. I read the damn thing hoping to find something exciting, but didn't find it anywhere. There's an old saying about writing ""don't tell, show"" you know what i mean? well, Tolkien tells. 'nuff said.( hey, look at Howard's Conan stories, and you'll see what i mean - he SHOWS!!!) What you need to know about Tolkien: While Tolkien started the modern genre of fantasy, he's at best only the one who introduced it."
1,Ugh!,"Ok, everyone goes on about how wonderful this series is. Perhaps I just didn't see the light. But I think I'm one out of a million people who have reviewed it, that STRONGLY disliked it. In fact, I couldn't even bring myself to finish it.I read 200 pages. I was pretty bored. I read 400 pages, I was sooo bored I coulnd't read it. I've finished every book I've started, except this one. This guy doesn't have sence for time flow. I mean, come on. One of the main characters dies and he writes ""...and so and so died. The mourned a while, and kept moving."" Goodness, it was horrible!After reading the hobbit (An alirght book I'd give two stars) I'd expected something more. Not literary garbage. The only reason I give it one star at all, is because I can't give zero.Perhaps you like boring dribble, I dunno. Their are lots of people who liked it, maybe you want to try. But believe me, nothing could have prepared me for such a disaster."
1,what's the deal,Am I the only person in the world who didn't like this book? what's the deal? i read the book and i was throughly dissapointed. i really don't see why everyone rants and raves over hobbits and dwarves and such. is the only reason because it was the first real good fantasy book? People need to get past tradition of what they grew up with and that the hobbit was there favorite book as a five year old. that's exactly the point though in my opinion- the book is childish and doesn't compare to some of the fantasy writers of our time. people need to get past there hang-ups that with this being a legend of the time and see it as it is- childish and just plain not very good.
2,"Overlong, boring and too generic after 50 years","There's nothing in this book that is new to the crowd that's been playing RPGs for the last ten years. Orcs, elves, trolls, dwarves, been there done that, from AD&D; via Warhammer to Warcraft. If you're familiar with the last three, you'll probably find LOTR to be an overlong travelogue wrapped around a WWII kind of story with orcs and trolls instead of Nazis.But you should read it, it won't leave you fascinated and amazed but it's a classic, an inspiration for about the half of RPG titles and swords & sorcery books right up to Harry Potter."
2,Dissapointed,Perhaps my fault but this wasnt the actualy book set. Seems like some type of tv/radio version of the storyline.
1,nice,"one of the first Fantasy books i eva read, got me hooks, i have read many more since thenoh btw, the 1 is to get yur attention cuz of all the 10's out there i would give it a 10 also =)"
1,These are horrible books,I have attempted to read these books but they are just so dull and boring that i havn't finished one yet. They are just overly decriptive!! Tolkein really could have summed up what his books were about in 100 pages... who needs 1000?? There is really no point in reading them and i discourage others from reading them too... If you want the story watch the movies.... Legolas is a wicked hot elf!!
1,This book is a joke,"Everybody told me JR.Tolkein's books on the Ring series is so good. I was so mislead. This book is not good, it is a neverending story to me. THe beginning was so sucky and did not make you want to read at all. I read Fellowship of the ring. I got to this council part, and i felt like I had had anough. I was like 200 pages through the book and all I had read was how the Hobbit walked through the jungle, and how good hid breakfest. JR.Tolkein told everything. He said how the Frodo gut pissed, tied his shoe, and how he talked. He spent a bout 50 pages writing a poem. I'm sorry to say this but this book %#^*@#$ sucks! Damn I got nothing that I had expected......Sorry about my bad language but I really hate this book and how it took my time."
2,"the movie was better, spare yourself....","As a dedicated reader of 20 or more years,i went back and read this after seeing the movie. honestly, skip the books,the writing is stilted, dialog poor. 20 some years ago, we all read tolkien and loved it, becuase there was not a lot else to read!. i worked my way thru this and prayed everyone would just fall into the crack of doom, and end the book. my reading friends all concurred w me,can't wait for part two of the movie."
3,I'm probably going to get hurt for this....,"I had heard about these books from most of my friends and so I decided to pick up the series myself. While the plot is very interesting, the writing style was hard for me to follow. At times I would get bored and at other times it would grab my attention for a while. It took me a year to read the ""Fellowship of the Ring."" I could never get into it. I would always get to never ending boring parts and put the book down and pick it up again a few weeks later. I had to force myself to finish the series. I had to force myself to read these books and I hate doing that, but these books rarely grabbed my attention. I'm going to try to read them again when I'm older and perhaps I'll think differently."
4,"A great adventure, but dull in places","I kind of did this backwards...I saw the movies before I read the book. I totally loved the Hobbit, maybe because I didn't see the movie (is there one?). The three Lord of the Rings books were really good, but man, they got boring sometimes. I mean, I think the movies actually improved on stuff, which is rare. In the book, Tolkien might spend 40 pages on some boring walk, including every detail of what they ate, what the trees looked like. Sure. All great stuff, in small chunks. But then he describes an epic battle scene in like 2 pages. That's supposed to be what everything else is leading up to.But that's about all I have to complain about. I mean the world in Lord of the Rings is so creative and interesting...like the Ents, as an example. They were way cool in the book. Even though it dragged sometimes, I read every word 'cause I liked it so much. A great read for anyone. Really. But definitely start with the Hobbit. That's the best of them all."
5,Great Boxed Set,Enjoy the future classics of Tolkien with this boxed set. Young and Adult Readers alike will lose themselves in the journey of the brave Hobbits and friends as they fight to save Middle Earth.
2,Movie covers get worse and worse,"I adore the books and the movies, but every time the publisher releases a new set of paperbacks with movie cover art, their choice of covers get worse and worse. The current cover art for Fellowship of the Rings is particularly bad, since it features Frodo in Shelob's lair. They should have kept the cover art from the first release, when the first movie came out."
3,Lots of Typos,"I bought the Ballantine boxed set of Lord of the Rings about Dec 1999 for an avid Tolkien fan who has unfortunately found many typos and errata in this edition of each book (roughly 6 to 12 per book). These word substitutions and omissions seriously damage the language and the meaning of the passages they occur in. This edition was in the dark blue box with red, green, blue and black book covers, but has the same ISBN number (0345340426) for the boxed set above* (and for the individual books). I hope that Ballantine has fixed all the errors in later printings of this edition. If not, I would recommend finding a copy of the older edition ca 1978 (white covers, picture of Tolkien on back of each book) which does not have the same problem."
5,Great saga - But many people don't have the patience for it anymore,"This is a great set and a masterpiece. I think, from reading most of the negative reviews is that many people no longer have the patience to obtain the level of involvment needed to follow these books. As for these being racist books - some people see racism in just about anything."
4,Great for the price.,"This is the best collection set I have found for LOTR without drying up your wallet. It doesn't cost near as much as the hard cover sets yet its quality is far better than some of the cheap paperback collections. The books are very durable and stylish (great cover art). The print is also small enough to keep the books compact yet not so tiny that you need a magnifying glass just to read. There is also a matching copy of ""The Silmarillion"". If you are looking to get a nice collection set of LOTR and The Hobbit without spending an arm and a leg, look no further."
2,lord of rings,"very very cheap but the quality of the mantainance is too low, definetly not good as it was written, long delivery time, but the price was really low so it's not a problem"
5,a wonderful series,"firstly I should say that I heartily agree with this other reviewer, although I have never read the ruins of the mist.Personally I think that this is one of the finest book series I hav read.Its my fourth time reading them and I highly reccomend them."
5,The Complete Lord of The Rings Trilogy & The Hobbit Set,"I chose this rating because, it was done in very professional manner, with excellent sound effects. I would recommend that everyone purchase this set."
5,Great set of books!,I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves all the books. She has seen all the movies and now the books.
2,Bad audio quality,"We purchased this for a long road trip in the car so we could listen to The Hobbit. The story is an amazing story and this review is NOT about Tokien's writing...it is simply about the recording/audio quality.I am a fan of the concept of AUDIBLE.COM, but I avoided one of the options here on Amazon b/c of their (in my opinion) poor audio quality. Well, this one was worse than my past audible.com experiences. The volume and the clarity was inconsistent (at best) and at times, depending on the chapter and the character, it was very hard to hear their dialogue. We constantly had to change the volume to either hear the character or to turn it down so we didn't blow our ears out. AND the voices/characters were...cheesy, to say the least. I know there are 14 main characters and then tons of ancillary voices, but some of them just sounded like they were the other characters only whining. It was quite annoying.So - buy an audio version of this book - just not THIS audio version!"
5,Terrific,Characters and places keep you immersed. The adventures of the Hobbits will place your immagination at new heights. Throughly enjoyable from the first to the fifth book.
5,A great work which created a whole new genre for itself,"I have read The Lord Of The Rings many times now and find it an enthraling and absorbing book. If you read it yourself you will understand why it has become a book of such high classic status. Many people (noticably they all seem to be Americans who cannot spell) compare the book to works such as The Sword Of Shanara and say that Tolkien copied it but if they did their research properly they would find that The Lord Of The Rings was published first. Considering this, Tolkein's work can only be described as a masterpiece."
5,The Best Books You Could Ever Read..,The Hobbit and Fellow Ship of the Rings Series is in my mind the best books that have and ever will be printed...I just love them. All the fun and magic but with the storyline made of gold to back it all up...If you buy any books from Amazon.com buy these.
2,Slow delivery,I would not order from this seller again as it took way too long to receive the order.
5,One of the best books I've ever read...,"I am a young reader but in my humble opinion, this is one of, if not the best book I've ever read. It was imaginative and sparked thoughts and emotions in me that I have never had before. I recomend this book to anyone who is looking for a port-hole into a whole new world of ecxitement, imagination, magic and learning. This book introduced me to a new line of mythological creatures and settings. I was moved by the triles and tribulations of the charicters of ""The Hobbit"". For anyone whos looking for a good recamendation, i give this set a big thumbs up!"
5,These books are excellent.,I once asked my father what his favorite book was and he said that it was not one book but a trilogy of books called the Lord of the Rings. I myself am not particularly interested in fantasy books but when I read these books I was taken to another world. I have never been so deeply involved in a books as I was with these three. If my kids ever ask me what my favorite book is I will say not one but a trilogy called The Lord Of The Rings. These books are amazing.
5,The Hobbit was awesome!,The Hobbit kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down. In a total of 3 days I experienced the most awesome book I have ever read! The best Fanasty book ever!
4,Pretty good,"This is one of the best noval in the whole world, and if you like fantasy, then I will highly recommand this book. If you like humors and twisting plotling,then I won't be recommanding this to you because there are hardly any humors.reading age: 15+"
4,One Ring For Verbosity,"I am no great fan of fantasy, but I was moved to read the Ring series out of my affection for spiritual and religious literature. This is, of course, the archetypal ""quest"" story, and in that regard succeeds. Tolkien revisits ancient hero stories and spins them all into an original odyssey -- made all the more intriguing by the fact that his heroes start off as meek and uninterested in adventure. In this respect, the books inspire readers to seek greatness within themselves.However, where one word would do, Tolkien devotes entire chapters. I have read few books as needlessly verbose and rambling, and this took away from the experience. The Hobbit and Ring books are not for those with short attention spans. Indeed, some monastic hermits might even find them hard to bear."
5,"Great Fantasy Tale, and its best Edition for Cash Value!","These Paperbacks are just that, but market size, with larger print. They are fairly durrable, and readable many times over. The Lord of the rings is simply the greatest fantasy tale ever told in my eyes. Start with the Hobbit though, so you can become familiar with the rich character background of middle earth. Lord of the Rings will leave a lasting imprestion on any Sci Fi, Fantasy reader. If you like books by CS Lewis for example, be sure to check these fabulous books out!"
5,Boredom Cure,"I bought this for my 10 year old grandson who managed to double-break his arm when he fell from a tree right at the start of summer. My hope was that this trilogy would go a long way toward relieving the hours of boredom facing this active, athletic boy. Success!!!!"
5,Complete collection received and enjoyed,"I ordered these books about 2 weeks ago and received them in less than a week. Delivery was timely and the well-packaged. The box cover was a bit worn but for the price and for a casual reader like me, all is good. This set is primarily to read and then share with others NOT to collect, its got great artwork and rather large letters but don't be annoyed if a page or two are folded or if the box show shelf-wear. Overall, I rate this buy 5 stars because it is exactly what I expected at a great price!"
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"I prefer trade paperbacks to mass markets which is why I chose these. I am also particular about the texture of the cover, which was great on this set... not too slippery and not too gritty."
5,great,My son was really happy with this box set and is reading the Hobbit now. I am happy a classic such as this can still reach the younger generations.
5,I still remember tolkien's books vividly after 25 years,It has been approximately 25 years since i read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy as a young boy. I remember each of these books vividly as if i had read them yesterday. Tolkien brings you into his world so completely that the reader loses all concept of time. I can remember reading for 8 hours straight as a kid...not wanting to put these books down and leave Tolkien's world. Tolkien had a profound impact on my enthusiasm for reading as a child. There is nothing that even compares to his works...The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy is a must for everyone. I have taken a few days off of work to reread these books...I am also giving the box set to everyone i know with young children....
5,what can i say?,"ok, if you haven't heard of these great/amazing books, let me give you a little advice.... READ THEM! Just from reading the whole series this year has had a huge impact on my life. Beyond that there aren't many other things to say! So if you're the type of person who appreciates good fantasy & all around great literature, (not to mention a little spirituality!) read LOTR, cuz you won't regret it!"
5,BBC Lord of Rings CD,"sure didn't like them. They don't follow the story, they are super abridged, they are lacking in color and vibrancy that even the weakest recording from earlier did. They would work for children too young to read the real works but too old to realize how shallow the story line is."
2,"Condition ""Good""","I just received my book today and as soon as I received the package I already noticed something wrong:*The book was just sitting in the large box, with paper balls stacked on top of it, no paper was on the underneath, which was scary, because my box was sitting in the rain when I got it.Opening the box I noticed another big flaw:*The box that holds the book had been damaged, having a huge dent on one of the corners.I was pretty sure that I had bought the book ""new"", considering the fact that I paid $35 for it.Looking at the receipt I noticed that the condition was ""Good"", not ""Perfect"" or ""New""I can't decide if the book was shipped like that, or it was the poor packaging that ruined the books.Other than the box, and some minor damages to the books everything seems in decent condition.I will keep the books and not return them, but never order from this seller again."
5,The Father of Fantasy,"J.R.R. Tolkien's novel THE LORD OF THE RINGS started the fantasy book craze. Still, it is #1 in the fantasy epics. I wouldnt recommend any other book for a person wanting to get started with fantasy novels.Hobbits, Ents, Elves and more what else could a imagintive person want.Do wizards, dragons, and knights help? All of the charachters in Tolkien's masterpiece are given a special place in our heart. Please read this set of books, thee shall not be dissapointed.HINT-If you Liked this book read, THE DEATH GATE CYCLE, series by Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman"
5,"Led Zeppelin and Tolkien, great!",Led Zeppelin 4 is such a great soundtrack for LOTR! All the other fantasy books are such rips! Espically RA Salvator. All he can do is rip Tolkien.
5,!!!THE greatest book of fantasy of all time,"Tolkien truly is a genious. In his masterpiece ""The Lord Of The Rings"", he not only writes a story, but creates an entire universe for us to explore"
5,The Absolutely best book written! My favorite by far!!!!!!!!,"The Lord Of the Rings is the absolutely best book series ever written! The characters captivated me, in such a way, that I have read the four books many, many times. J.R.R. Tolkien is my favorite writer! I love his books so much, that I can hardly put them down once I read only a little bit. The drama, action, and comedy, mixed together with the fantasy of this Middle Earth, creates a wonderful tale, so jammed pack with excitement, that its no wonder this book is the best! I simply love the main characters: Bilbo, Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf and Sam. They are the best ever! What a fantastic book!!!"
5,This book is the best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I recomend this book to anybody who has the time to read it. It has everything you could ask for;adventure,fantasy,suspense,and at the end of the book-series,you'll want to read it again and again."
5,The Greatest Books Ever Made!!!,"As you stroll through the pages of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, your mind is actually in the book. As you battle the orcs and evils of Mordor, the excitement never stops. As you travel with Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, and many other characters, you'd think as if you were with them on their journey. Page after page, chapter after chapter, and book after book . . . you will realize that J.R.R. Tolkien has written the best books . . . ever!!! Someone really should make these books into a set of modern movies, not only will it deserve an oscar, it will be astounding and extraordinary!!!"
5,was very impressed,I was very impressed with the prompt delivery and the books themself. I was also bery much surprised at the price. I will keep doin business with Amazon.
3,"Well, now..","...I'm sorry I have to give only 3 stars but the old-fashioned grammar and huge long formal challenges and puny descriptions of battles put me off. I like the Hobbit much better than the trilogy. The story had a dreamy quality to it that almost made me fall asleep as I read it. I did like the books, I really did, but you have to really sift through the words(and *%#$^ old-fashioned style!) to understand these books. Other than, that, great read. Just read it when you're at least 10. I read The Fellowship of the Ring at 9 and the Hobbit at 8 and I almost threw down the books in favor of my old Dragonlance books. And I am not kidding, my brother gave me The Hobbit to read so I would stop pestering him. I'm glad he did."
1,NOT the books,"I thought I was buying the ""books"" on CD. Wanted it for a long road trip.... This set is NOT the books - rather it's a bad re-telling of the stories. It is so poorly done, it seemed to be a joke,but the joke was on me! If you love Lord of the Rings, you will hate this CD set!"
1,Not as Advertised,"The book pictured is not what you get. I ordered this version because it is the exact one my Dad had years ago before the books got destroyed. So getting something different than pictured was a big disappointment, especially after spending 97 dollars on it."
5,Amazed!!,"I was astonished by the depth of Tolkein's work. Vivid charactors, amazing plot...this is everything a reader could hope for. The art is brilliant. I think everyone should read this book. Even when I had finished it for the second time I was left hungering for more. it is an excelent deal for its price, and if i were you i'd click on BUY NOW immiediently."
4,Hello Hobbit,"This book was a fantastic, scary and sad story all at the same time. The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien tells about a hobbit named Bilbo who goes on an adventure as a robber to take back a long lost treasure. Smaug the dragon stole the treasure from the dwarves thousands of years ago. Now Bilbo, the 13 dwarves and the mysterious wizard Gandalf must go take back the treasure. The author made this book so interesting by putting in so much detail in every little sentence. An event at the end of the book may change all your feelings about the book."
5,An awesome read,"If you like fantasy books, here are the BEST ever written. Tolkien creates a vivid world where good battles evil. If you saw the movies, (cartoon or new) READ THE BOOKS! It only gets better. A word of caution to this tale: There is a very long prologue to Fellowship of the Ring. If to start to tire of it, jump right into the book. After the book, if you're curious, go back to it."
5,Awesome book,I couldn't put the book down all of the series is awesome i strongly urge you to read the books i'd tell you more about the book but if you havn't read it i'll give away he great finle ending you'll love this book i sure did!
5,These Are Good,"If you look up the definition of good books in the dictionary, there would probably be a picture of these books. If you like fantasy, you're in for a treat. I have to say, though, that if you don't have a long attention span you really shouldn't read these books. They're not the kind of books you can listen to music and read at the same time because you really need to concentrate to understand all of it. Anyway these books are probably the best books I've ever read. When you see the movies your favorite part is always the blood and the violence, but when I read these probably the chapters that took place in the shire are probaly my favorite. Tolkien makes the shire sound so wonderful when he talks about the hobbits' lives and how they are so pleasant. I was actually really sad when they left and did the big battles and things. So overall, these books are the best books ever created whether you like it or not, so if you don't read them you're missing out."
5,Wonderful as always,"Have read this series several times, but wanted a young friend to experience it. She is absorbed in the reading. Good news!"
4,"Nice Set, But Not For Those Hard on Their Books","Okay, I really liked the size of each of these books and having the complete set in one handy box. Unfortunately, these paperbacks will not withstand the reading habits of the average 11 yo boy. For adults, this set should be perfect. For kids, maybe I should've sprung for the hardback version."
1,Not a true set,The books don't look anything like the picture. They are very old and damaged. The offer was very diceaving. I was expecting to receive a set of books and not 4 books that clearly were not sold as a set.
3,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Set Review,"I wanted to give myself a suitable and nice gift for New Year. I prefer books over all other stuff and I decided to get myself one of my favorite books.I am not satisfied entirely because I expected little more from what I got, but contents of books are award enough.Format of books is small, paper is cheap and design is poor.Compared to price it is quite OK.Overall impression is OK."
3,A few very annoying printing errors,"The tale within is obviously 5 stars. I dock this edition of that tale down to 3 stars due to some incredibly annoying printing errors. I have no clue why this is, since I thought the last time Houghton Mifflin reset the printing was over 5 years ago. But in either case, this edition has some errors that will certanily annoy you if you are looking for perfection. If this is your first time reading the trilogy then by all means get this pack, it's a great value and the artwork is solid. But if you are looking for a gift set or what have you, check out some of the nicer hardback editions, such the red leather collectors edition of Lord of the Rings, and the green one for the hobbit."
4,"Abridged, but fun for the whole family","I listened to this dramatization after I'd read The Lord of the Rings, and I enjoyed it. Though it's an abridged version, most of the important parts are included and you get a very good idea of the full scope of the story.I think the character of Sam is particularly well done. He shows that courage is when an ordinary person does something extraordinary out of necessity, not because of an ideal. I also liked the Ents--they were just how I imagined them--and Merry and Pippin's clowning was fun. Hearing Tom Bombadil speak also made some sense out of all those Ring Dong a Dillos!I would recommend this audiobook as a family activity. If you have children too young to read the book by themselves, they would certainly enjoy listening to this dramatization (though you may have to help the younger ones through a few scary parts)."
5,One of the best books ever written...,"This book will keep you up at night! Not in fear, but because you can't put it down. I have missed more hours of sleep to the Lord of the Rings than I care to remember. The Hobbit is a great book, the Lord of the Rings are better. Filled with rich descriptions and powerful messages these books should be required reading in all High Schools!"
3,Small letters,"I purchased this books for my 10 year old who wanted them for Christmas, but when I got to see them inside was very disappointed of how small and cramped together the letters are."
3,About this paperback edition...,"I am a huge LotR fan, and bought this particular edition about a year and a half ago. For the most part, I was very happy, but once I read through the books, I saw dropped words, words that had been left out and then copied in later, so the print of the one word is sideways on the page, and there are many places where the ink is horribly smudged. Also, I have noticed many typos, some which make the sentence difficult to understand. Because of the quality of the actual literature, I got my money's worth, but beware this edition. :)"
2,"Great box, too bad about the books","Fans of the Peter Jackson movies may enjoy having photos of the actors on the spines of the covers, but the books are printed on cheap paper in an eyestrain-inducing small font. The cover of one of my volumes was ripped when I took it out of the box. Treat yourself to a better edition that you can read and reread as much as these wonderful books deserve."
1,To boring to finish,"I started the triolgy in 1970. About half way through ""Fellowship of the Rings"" I was bored but I kept reading it becuse so many of my friends had recommended the books. I started ""Two Towers"" thinking 'this has to get better' but it never did. I threw out the set without ever finishing ""Two Towers"". I know I'm the minority opinion here but I have the feeling I'm part of a larger minority than these reviews would indicate."
1,Overrated!,I read through these 4 volumes 33 years ago when I came to England because many of my fellow students raved about them.The Hobbit is mildly amusing story suitable for children.The LOTR is rather dreary boring tale which requires a lot of perseverence to complete. I have not re-read it since unlike other novels that I have re-read multiple times purely because a good work of literature improves on re-reading.If you want to read a true epic with complicated human characters try reading a retelling of the Mahabharata.
4,Toughin' out Tolkien,"Yeah, I also started the Fellowship of the Ring a couple years ago. I must say Rivendell bored me to tears--so i quit reading and have only recently completed the series. It's a lot easier (since the movie came out last Dec) to penetrate his writing, because you can simply envisualize the characters and somehow struggle through the most tedious of moments.by the way, that ""inkling"" thing was corny...i think everyone knows that he was part of the Inklings, yadda, yadda... :)by the way...for anyone interested....there's alwaysRobert Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" series which I would highly recommend"
2,"Dragging, too long, boring, but has its moments","I think I will never understand why people are veneratingJRR Tolkien like the author of the century. I mean, yes hewrites beautifully and he created a world so deep and detailed.So I guess The Lord of the rings is a great book, in the sensethat it's a nicely crafted piece of word art and creativity.However, I usually like more selfcontained stories where moredepth is given to less characters. This story goes left andright into thousands of sidestories that are not all veryinteresting. The full story itself could have been containedinto one 400 pages book instead of three painful tomes. Thisoverdescriptive and dragging work, ""masterpiece"" is highlyoverrated and I only recommend it to people who have a LOT oftime to kill.On the other hand, the movie was totally awesome. It grabbedall the essential aspects of the book and bundled that intoa superb film. Leaving out all the uncessary babbling thatmake this book a painful read."
2,Paper back? Come on..,"Not going to get into the books themselves...Just the box set. Its paper back. If you are going to buy the books (and many of us already have them) why not get them as they were intended? Bound in leather with that musky smell of aged paper. When I read these books I don't want to do it over the Kindle or with a crappy paper back. I want to feel the weight of the world Tolkien created and a nice, big, coffee table size tablet is just the way to do that."
5,GREAT BOOKS - DEFINATELY A MUST READ,"I have loved these books ever since my Mom read the ""riddles"" from the Hobbit aloud to my family when I was about 6. Later at 12, she read the Hobbit to my older sister and me. Tis last Christmas my favorite present was a gift from Mom and Dad of the LOTR set. Mom is now in the proccess of reading the books to the whole family! These are great books. THere are very few books of this quality being printed today! I am continually amazed at JRR Tolkein's creativity and imagination. He not only created fictional beings, but also made up the different languages. He was a very talented man.I think my favorite character is Aragorn. Then Gandalf and Frodo. I have a warm spot for Arwen Evenstar, because my sister is named after her.I cannot believe that some people believe they are dry. BUT, everyone is entitled to their opinion. I truly believe that they are a GREAT addition to any library!"
5,TOLKIEN ROCKS THE WORLD NOT JUST MIDDLE EARTH,"Tolkien is the best, the greatest. You have to read the Books! This guy knows his work. Some of the Greatest books in the world are right here, you got to read them!You should read, All Tolkiens books, and C.S. Lewis is good two."
5,Tolkien,"How can one review a work that has been so loved by me for nearly fifty years. Have read it to multiple generations of children, and this latest purchase is for my 11 year old grandson, to whom I read The Hobbit, which he adored. He's ready for Lord of the Rings now, and I'm sure he'll love it."
5,A Great Work,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a work of pure genius. Mr. Tolkien had a wonderful imagination. He makes everything come alive, giving the feeling that this isn't fantasy but reality, which seems like it's some ancient history that has been long forgotten. This trilogy also gives readers the imagination to soar into worlds far away, dreams of heroes, conflict, beauty and grandeur."
5,One of the greatest masterpieces of all time.,"The title says it all, pretty much. It takes a long time to read unless you become obsessed and absorbed by it (which happened for me in intervals). It took me nearly four years to complete both The Hobbit and the trilogy, but it was worth every bit of effort. I can't even list it as my favorite book because all others feign in comparison to it. It is not even possible to compare. Read this book and you will never be sorry that you did. (By the way, I consider them to all be one book, as they are all part of one story.)"
1,Why buy what you can get for free...,"Go to: http://www.picasa.com/google/and you can get this for free, its now a part of google, why spend 25 bucks?"
3,Picasa is simple but doesn't do much like the new Memories,"Picasa is simple to arrange photos but there is hardly anymore ability after that. However, I think that more and more people are beginning to look for the ability to organize photos with other files like words and music. [...]I want software like Picasa to go beyond generic photo organizing capabilities. I'm looking to the new generation of software like Memories that can handle all sorts of multimedia and is very easy to use"
5,Love this product,"Got this for my wife so she doesn't have to use Photoshop. We use it to deal with our snapshots and save Photoshop for in-depth photo projects. I tried the demo of Adobe 'Album' product but it seemed slow to load and less intuitive and easy to use than Picasa.Pros: Love the interface, makes it easy to import, crop and print our digital photos.Cons: Would like to have drag and drop tagging for metadata and the ability to easily change the brightness/contrast of images. The edit 'enhance' function seems to do nothing.Overall, hats off to Lifescape, looking forward to the next release!"
2,Don't waste your time,"Here is the problem: Every year the test is different. This prep test isn't going to help you pass the exam. The exam is largely based on what you should already know. But if you must, brush up on the parts of speech, poetic devices, types of poetry, and literary genres. This exam will also test your knowledge of certain authors...there is no way for you to know which author's they're going to ask you about. Luckily these are only a few questions. In short, the few things you could possibly study up on you could find on the internet. You don't need this book."
3,"English Language Lieterature and Composition: Essays and Pedagody Study Guide (Praxis Study Guides) test codes: 0042,0043","I believe the Pedagogy (0043) was very well outlined with multiple examples for teaching literature. It also gives you a list of the books you can read to prepare you for the test and there were several sample responses. However, the were not enough sample responses for the responding to student writing."
4,It's a very nice seat!,"We've tried other seats on the market - even one you install and flip down (that one was lovely, poked you in the back if you were an adult user!). This one is very nice, easy to keep clean, looks great. I gave it 4 stars because the hole is a little wider than most kid seats, so my skinny two year old still needs to support herself somewhat. Great product overall."
4,Great seat for kids!,This seat has definitely saved us space in our tiny bathroom (used to be a closet). My only complaint-- or I should say my husbands complaint-- i that he has to hold the lid up the whole time when he goes to the bathroom. Other than that I cannot say enough great things about this seat.
2,Toilet Seat is So-So,"We got this seat about a year ago for our son. The concept is great and has worked pretty well, however, there is one major fault....my husband hates it! When you put the entire seat up for the guys to urinate, it does not stay up on it's own! He has to hold it up while he is urniating or else the seat comes crashing down. So, needless to say we will be getting rid of it soon. Also, my son often complains that it hurts his rear end when he is sitting on it longer than a few minutes. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have a man living in your house unless you want to annoy him on purpose. :)"
4,Good alternative to removable training seats,"This is a good alternative to the removable training seat. The adults in the house do not have to worry about removing the training seat but not having a good place to put it. The kids in the house feel more ""grown-up"" since they are using the same type of seat as mommy and daddy. The installation is relatively simple, and the seat blends in well without being obtrusive. There is one drawback in the design though, in that there is a small space between the child and adult seats, so ""leakage"" may occur through that space. You may have to train the kids to position themselves in a good angle to minimize the occurrences."
1,introduction to song writing,"The notion of songwriting is watered down--but for the beginner that wants to have a foundation--a decent book.However, the problem with this type of reading is that the field of songwriting is saturated--that any book might be able to provide better quality.Buy something else."
1,Save your Money and Pass on this Outdated Video,"I was really disappointed, it seemed very outdated and lacked good information. Save your money, I sure wish I had passed on this one. I went back to another video I found online and bought it, what a difference.If you really want a good guide to Pool Care do a search for ""Tips from the Pros Pool Care Video"", it is more expensive but filled with information. I believe it is at PoolCareVideo.com"
1,Complete Guide to Swimming Pool Care ~ VHS,"Good cover and title but thats about it. It seems to be alittle outdated. Not a lot of help, Save your money!"
3,Wealth of Information,"Gary P. Lantham and Kenneth N. Wexley's book is a thorough account of the history of performance appraisal and how performance appraisal has held up in the legal system. The authors advocate a reasonable plan for appraising employee performance but do not acknowledge a perfect appraisal system is beyond our reach. As long as human behavior is evaluated, subjectivity can not be removed from the process. Lantham and Wexley's plan does provide for a system that would improve appraisal documentation and application of training in many organizations. The book should be required reading by all professionals for one reason probably not intended by the authors. Improving Productivity Through Performance Appraisal explains how important goal-setting is to performance and how to apply feedback to improving personal performance."
4,Good Cheer Shoe,I really liked the shoe but was a little disappointed that it ran small and that information was not given. I ordered them a sized bigger than what my daughter wears and they were still small. I had to return them and order another size bigger than that. These shoes run about two sizes smaller than stated. So if you order them order them two sizes bigger than what is needed. The quality of the shoe is good and they are well made.
4,great batteries,I've used them heavily for over 2 years (I'm a wedding photographer) and they've worked great.
2,No shelf life -- high discharge rate,"These batteries work great if you plan on using them the day you charge them. But if you charge them and don't use them right away you'll find that you have no charge left.I would charge these and put them in my camera and after a week (of no use) they would be completely dead.Since I don't have many devices that require this sort of usage (use it all up in one day), they are pretty worthless to me."
1,Didn't hold charge,"From reading these reviews, I guess these batteries are a hit or miss. Mine did not hold their charge after completely draining them and recharging them. They could not even power my camera through the day for a trip to Disneyland. Due to the expense of sending these back to J & R, I didn't bother to return them so I don't know if I received a defective batch."
2,Beware,"I purchased the Power 2000 charger with 8 AA NiMH batteries. New out of the box only 7 of the 8 batteries would charge up. 3 of them checked on a battery tester after charging overnight showed only 80% capacity. Very disappointing. After spending $70 from a store that does not accept returns on batteries. VidPro wants $8.95 to return the defective battery. I did not purchase these on Amazon, wish I had because Jersey Camera sold me 4 for $25 and Amazon lists the same batteries 4 for $5."
5,Celtic at its best,"I bought this CD years ago and it has been one of my favorite Christmas treats ever since. As the last reviewer noted, the authentic Celtic sounds are a joy to listen to, like a medieval celebration. The contemporary CDs that wear the label ""Celtic"" are poor impostors, at best.I love the music so much that I decided to buy a CD as a Christmas gift last year. I didn't know it was out of production. I searched EVERYWHERE and found one copy...for $30. I had to pass, but this year several Amazon sellers are offering ""pre-loved"" CDs at very reasonable prices. (Thank you, sellers.) Music doesn't evaporate when the shrink wrap isn't there.Celtic at its authentic finest. It will make your ears smile."
3,not the tool for the job,"The performance of the tool is compromised by manufacturing compromises. The body of the tool is cast and painted, which is OK for the handles but the blade rests on this uneven surface which results in chattering accross the wood. The tool also clogs up immediatly. For the time I spent trying to tune it up to make it useful, I could have bought a tool with a machined bed and a high-quality blade. Google spokeshave and buy a better tool - that what I ended up doing.Also - skip the honing guide offered as a companion purchase. The blade is too short to fit in the guide, so it is useless."
4,Good for the money,"This is not one of your higher end tools, BUT it is well worth the money if you just need a small spokeshave for little jobs.As with all blades, this did need some sharpening and honing before it was usable. Fairly easy to adjust the depth, though, so it's a good tool for little $$$."
4,Nice tool.,"Nice product, sturdy.Needed a good sharpening out of the package (but I assume that is to be expected).Worked nice on some hard maple (guitar necks).I'd buy it over again."
1,Few Specifics,"On the Go with Baby contains many amusing anecdotes about Lutz's travels with her daughter. However, as someone who resides overseas, and has already traveled to Hong Kong, Bali, and back and forth across the Pacific with an eight month old I was looking for more specific information. Her book did not even contain something as simple and helpful as a travel checklist of items to bring for around town or for out of town trips--I found that on the Babies R Us website and modified it to my needs. As someone who has, an will continue to take long flights with a little one I was also looking for ingenious ways to keep the little guy entertained on long hauls--no such luck. The strategies for eating out are common sense and ones you are probably doing already. There is really nothing new or enlightening in this book."
3,Great Masterpiece-Poor sound...,"The sound mix on this is atrocious! I bought to hear any extra material I could find on this amazing Rolling Stones Christmas album (it will always be a Christmas album to me- bought {shoplifted, actually} it at 16, the Christmas it came out). It will always be the Stones album that is closest to my heart, but I'm pretty perverse....The whole feel of it evokes winter forever!"
1,Trashy defense of poor choices,Parts of this book are circulated on the internet. It reads like a miserable pron story. It is a a thinly clad attempt to discredit atheological view as evidenced by the second part of the book. File this one under F for Fiction! She now has another website espousing some radical theological points of view.
5,Cuts just as good as stainless steel blade!,"I was told by a co-worker to only buy stainless punchdown blade, specifically fluke blades. The Paladin Surepunch blade works just as well, if not better than the flukes blade. I've been using this blade with the Paladin punch down toolPaladin Tools 3591 SurePunch Pro PDT with 110/66 Combination Cut-Only Blade."
3,Aerobies Break Easy,I had an aerobie for a year and played with it a bunch and it was just fine. After a year's worth of abuse it got 2 cracks. I ordered a new one - after 20 throws it was cracked. What kinda product is that?Beware - if you can even SEE a tree the aerobie will find it too. Not for small areas.
2,Christian Tao,"This book a Christian interpretation of the Tao Te Ching, and tries to incorporate Taoist philosophies into American Protestant tradition. While it certainly is interesting, readers who want to read a version closer to the original text may have to look elsewhere. No where in the preface or in the translation do it show that the writer reads classical Chinese. My advice is give this book a flip if you are interested in the idea it is expounding; real students of a critically faithful version must search elsewhere."
5,What a series!,"Read Reese, Sullivan, and Rico. Have other three waiting for me. Wished I knew they came in two bundles before I read Reese. I hadn't read these authors before, so I only tried the first. They have to be the best series I've read and I have read many. Women always like it when men like these six run up against a brick wall--named a woman. I loved that these books have so much humor and fun extra characters in them. In Sullivan I know ""scrubbing the tub"" will become a phrase we all will want to use."
4,El-Hazard 2,"This is a continuation of the storyline of one of the El-Hazard series and it is quite good. The drunk teacher makes a run for the hills,literally,before his wedding and leaves a very cranky Water Priestess,Miez, at the alter. The gang goes after him to bring him back only to find another Infarita and another female-looking instrument of mass destruction awakened by the Bugrum. This could stand alone,somewhat,as its own short story but it puts a nice cap onto the original El-Hazard series,the version that has Aliel as a raging lesbian. Well recommended."
2,"""Current views"" in a language that is less than precise","It must be the influence of the other authors, because other books by Dr. Mihm are much more clearly written. Nevertheless this book probably has to be read as the alternative is to read journals. Mercy! Please try not to obscure the subject any further."
4,Re: Rynoshaft,"I'd just like to mention, these fans are SUPPOSED to suck air into the case. The airflow should be for cool air to get drawn in through the front, flow past the hot components (CPU, HD, etc.) then get pushed out through the back of the case through the case fans in the back (also the fans in your power supply). So this product works as expected."
3,its ok,the bulbs are 100watt not 110 watt. the purpose of purchasing these bulbs was to be able to see more at night. it does the job of lighting the way but i would have thought the bulbs would be little more yellow then it is. dont expect a HID yellow but more like a slight tint of yellow. but overall the bulb does a good job lighting the way.
3,Gracias / Thks,"Excelente servicio al cliente, no recibi el articulo que anunciaban y corrigieron rapidamente el error.Desafortunadamente vivo en Colombia y me fue imposible devolver la mercancia.Excellent customer service, not receive the paper announcing the error and corrected quickly.Unfortunately I live in Colombia and I could not return the merchandise."
2,They're great till they burn out.,First off the bulbs are 100w. They have a really unique light pattern and look great. I got 4 of these because i know that with the higher wattage they won't last as long as the stock 55w bulbs but what i did not expect was going through all 4 bulbs in less than 2 weeks. I won't be buying these again its just not worth the $16 a week price tag.
4,Omar Sharif Bridge,I bought this many years ago and have practiced hundreds and hundreds of hands on it. It is very useful to practice play of the hand. There is also an option to adjust the bidding style. There are now newer programs that I would suggest for intermediate+ players. This program is useful for beginners.
2,Buy this in stores only,"I have purchased this item in stores for a number of years and found it to be one of the best three-in-one products available. When the Stila convertible color stick arrived by mail the roll-up color was so soft that it broke repeatedly and the product itself created smudge instead of the usual fine line. The liner stick fell out after three days. There was no product in the shadow part, which left only the sponge in working order. I have always liked this Stila product, but will buy it in the stores from now on, where I can examine it to see if it is still the fine product I remember."
3,I want to love it...,"but... the rhythm section (for whatever reason) sounds shaky, and Dex a moments seems a bit lost. Some clams from Freddie too.This said, still has some golden moments, but really, only for the collector or Dexter addict.Not a must own."
3,Brilliant but No Fun,"I love everything the 'plastic have done, but usually their songs sound like the lost soundtrack to a Sid and Marty Kroft series - pop-saturated and exuberant. Perhaps because this is a memorial work, it's a little more somber and ethereal than I would like from these guys. Outside of that context it's a brilliant album, a sonic landscape of considerable sophistication.If you don't like this one, I would refer to you 7x7x7 or BANG! THE WORLD IS ROUND."
5,love to watch what people bring in,"it is interesting to see what people bring in and what the buys buy, and what price is finally settled on."
1,The best I can do is 0.50 cents,"you can see this on tv for free , not that you would ...... Not worth the money At all , font buy , you will quite literally hate your self"
4,Rick gets the date wrong..,"Always a great show, but Rick does the guy who brings in the gambling kit no favours. The hallmarks of a lion, crown and a capital U, show that the knife was hallmarked in Sheffield England in 1840, and could easily have been an original part of the gambling set.."
5,Where will I be without my pawnstars...,"After travelling recently, and not being able to receive my US TV, I have caught up on my missed pawn star episodes with thanks to Amazon. Picture quality is great, works directly with my Roku box.Very happy!"
1,Where's the meat???,"Berkowitz is about the most loquacious writer that I've ever read. Sure, annalogies are helpful learning tools but Berkowitz takes it to an extreme with every chapter starting with a pointless story and nearly every paragraph using a different ""cute"" analogy. There are so many analogies in this book that it actually makes the subject at hand harder to learn because you'll spend to much time trying to remember every analogy. Then there's the fact that he fills additional space with pictures of his analogies (do I really need to see a two pictures of the Cheyenne Mountain operations center to understand his analogy?). In fact, the book is so full of [stuff] from Berkowitz trying to be witty that I'm sure you could fit the real information into a quarter of the pages..."
3,Laugh out loud fun!,"Rinker Buck has captured all the excitement, innocence, pluck, and wide-eyed enthusiasm in ""First Job."" I can't imagine anyone coming of age in the early 1970s who couldn't relate to his story. His ability in describing the lushness of the Berkshires is on a level with James Michener. Without the self-congratulatory sexual conquests, this could have been a near-perfect read. How much sexier the story could have been with just a hint of the romantic entanglements. Seems like an awful lot of explaining to do to the women in his family! That said, I'd still recommend this as a truly fun read. Way to go, Rinky!"
5,WOW!,"Bravo TDK! This is the best cdr burner I have seen for the price. I originally bought one for my grandfather, who finds it very easy to use, then went out and bought one for my parents. This is a fantastic product and reafirms my confidence in TDK products. If you're comparing with others, buy this one! You will not be disappointed."
2,Tech support is a bust,"I bought this product last week, followed their directions, had a 600MZ drive with 128 ram which was within their requirements.When the computer did not recognize the drive, I called tech support 3 times, and all times I was run around all over the internet to download this and download that. They didn't tell me how to find the information, just find it. Ended up having to take and have the drive installed by tech. They had to re-install OS. 98SE Still am waiting for the TDK tech to call me back after he had done some research. It was suppose to be an easy install, In my case it wasn't, and tech support gave me the run around."
2,poor natural trumpet playing,"The Hungarian State Opera Orchestra's accompaniment warrants no complaint, but Inhoff's playing is very disappointing. He has trouble navigating around pitch issues and trills on the natural trumpet, and an apparent lack of flexibility makes his playing graceless, pinched, inarticulate, and, at times, rhythmically imprecise. Far superior recordings of these works on natural trumpet can be found by Niklas Eklund and Crispian Steele-Perkins."
2,GREEN,"I DONT BELIEVE I FEEL MUCH OF AN ENERGIZING BOOST, HOWEVER I LIKE THE WAY IT TASTES, AND I LIKE KNOWING IM TAKING SOMETHING WITH NUTRITIONAL INGREDIENTS."
1,Bait and Switch. Buyer beware.,"The paper that comes with the unit is actually not ordinary at all. It is a small pad (not a4 size). It is about 5 inches by 7 inches of writing space. Very hard to take notes with this. Additionally, after checking 5 stores (officemax, etc) NOBODY carries the pad size, you have to drop down to an even smaller pad which ends up sliding around.Stay away."
2,Great Concept - Poor Execution,"This is a wonderful idea, but is apparently before its time or the product designers didn't check with with the paper manufacturers. It is easy to train the system to interpret bad handwriting, but accomplishing that, it is impossible to find replacement paper pads. The only replacement pads I have been able to find are steno pads and these don't have the same page/space productivity as the original paper which comes with the AceCad. Either make replacement pads available or make the writing surface a different size to conform to writing pads that are more readily available."
4,Exactly as described,"I like this because unlike Graphic Drawing Tablets, which I have, there is more control with the pen. I tend to slip around a lot on the tablets which is something I just need to get used to. Also, the perk is you can use it without your computer and upload later. Personally, I like it for sketching but I have also used it for notes."
3,Digital pad,"The digital pad works very well. There are 2 problems: Unable to find 6"" x 9"" pads in office supply stores; no provision to use a 6"" x 9"" notebook vice a pad."
1,Not worth the effort,I bought this with great hopes.. I even threw out the box.. then the pen did not work and the system quit. Tech support via email was helpful but now I need to try and find a service place in the USA to either send it to or contact them to fix it. Not really worth my time.. and I wished I would have not bought it and applied the money to my new iPad which is fantastic! Bye-bye kindle.. hello iPad ebooks!
4,"Does a great job, with limitations","Length:: 1:34 MinsThe 692 has become one of my best friends - great for taking meeting notes and sharing them later. Also, I draw mockups for projects using a grid system, then use the digital copy in my rough project guides, converting them using OmniGraffle later. The 692 doesn't have Mac or Linux software, but my video review talks about that. Also, the 692 cannot operate as a live tablet when plugged-in."
2,Disappointed,"Got this for my grandaughter for Christmas, did not know you had to buy another program to read her writing so it is virtually useless unless I spend another 100.00 very disappointed"
1,How to make an Amish Quilt...,"I would love to make an Amish Quilt, if this book ever gets here, maybe I will....."
4,Based on true events / Beauty can be also a curse,"An intriguing story about a group of friends in a small french town. These 4 boys and one girl create relations with bonds that become very strong and destructive (as the story unfolds). It's Pierre, whose provocative and egoistic behaviour make him the centre of the story. He is obsessed with being loved, being desired by everybody, which leds him to have affairs with all members of the group (including his own sister!) and to sell his body to an old closet gay.The life is going well, until the day the young man is found dead...There is no happy-ending here. And though, some of the plots may seem disturbing, the film is really well done and well acted. I don't regret any single second I spent in front of my tv."
3,"One good, one so-so, one bad","""Run Silent, Run Deep"" is one of the best WW2 submarine pictures ever made. The action is taut, the characters work well and the story is interesting. I recommend it highly. ""Beachhead"" is so-so and very hard to get into. Not a great movie but worth watching once. ""Beach Red"" just doesn't work, the story just creeps along slowly and the actors seem to have phoned in their parts. I would recommend that, if you haven't seen these before, you rent them first, then buy this disk if you like them."
2,Only a researcher would love,I thought this would be a interesting read. It reads like a daily log of what this indian did over a long time.He was a bad shot at game.
3,it took over three weeks to receive my order,"This was a gift for my Grandson for Valentines Day. I ordered it on January 5 and it didn't arrrive until February 1. The book was in good condition, and has a lot of interesting information in it. My main objection was the time that it took to arrive. I thought it got lost in the mail. It wasn't shipped directly from Amazon's warehouse. It was a product from an approved seller."
2,Duplicate of usborne children's encyclopedia,"We purchased this for our 5-year-old who loved the space section of her Usborne Internet Linked Children's Encyclopedia. We were sorely disappointed to find that this book was merely an exact duplicate of the pages in the Space section of the Children's Encyclopedia, with a only 6-8 pages of new information added. My daughter's response said it all: ""I already have this book, Mommy.""The book itself--the presentation, illustration and information--are fantastic for kids interested in outer space and space exploration. The book presents it all in a very easy-to-read and easy-to-understand way. But if you already own the big Usborne Children's Encyclopedia, you'll find nothing new here."
2,er.... I don't think I like it,"I proudly proclaim Veruca Salt to be my favourite band of all time (with or without Nina)and have come to adore all of their music in all it's variety and uniqueness...even Nina's off-spin albums... I'm confused, then, that I don't think I like this album at all! Where are the belting hooks? Where is the clever crafted angst? Where are the lyrics that suprise and challenge you? Where is Louise's beautiful voice souring above the din? ""You've got me running but I can't see you coming, baby"" ...???? Every time I try and listen to it I can't help skipping through the songs hoping the next will be better. I do like ""So weird"". Sort of. Sorry Veruca Salt... I still love you. But I think I must be getting old."
5,I can't stop listening to it,"I've been a fan of Veruca Salt from the beginning, and right now this is my favorite of their albums. Louise Post is a total rock goddess, and her vocals are even stronger and more nuanced than before. I'm finding lately that when people are talking to me, I'm pretending to listen, but really singing Louise's lyrics (from IV) in my head."
4,The best CD since the split for anyone,"I suppose some would consider maturity and Rock music to be rather oxymoronic terms, but I think that is best way to describe the music. Louise's singing ability has improved and the music has grown, she has moved far beyond the pop punk/grunge - sound of the 90's. Combined with thoughtful lyric this is a CD that demands close listen."
3,V.Salt IV,"Veruca Salt is one of the Best Alternative Bands that i've heard.I recommend you to buy ""American Thighs"" and ""Eight Arms to Hold You"" an this too"
1,disappointed in Amazon,"While the book is great, as all Max Lucado books are, it is disappointing the Amazon charged me 4.99 for this book that has a publisher price of 2.99 and is only 55 pages. Boo Amazon."
1,give it all to him,"I thought I paid way too much for this book. I didn't realize that the book was only 53 pages and sold for 2.99 regularly. I think by the time I had purchased and had it mailed to me I spent $8.00 or $9.00. I usually feel that most book I am getting a better price than bought at the store. With this one, it has taught me to pay better attenion to the price of the book and what the shipping with cost....Michelle"
3,Honestly haven't read it yet so it could be spectacular,I haven't had a chance to get around to this one yet. I am more drawn to first hand experiences rather than this type of story frame.
5,A wonderful picture of the burden of sin and deliverance.,Lucado is a master of story pictures. I love his style and his simple explanations of scripture and the application of his stories. Good book!
5,Book by Max Lucado,Max Lucado has such a wonderful way of telling short stories about life. I turn to his books whenever I am down and need a little pick me up.
5,Powerful,This is a quick and easy read. . .a book I will go back to over and over. Powerful. . .simply powerful.
3,Gift for class,"This booklet was inexpensive enough that I was able to purchase 7 copies formy Bible Study class as a parting gift when the study came to an end.Getting rid of our ""trash"" is a good reminder for everyone: young believer andold alike."
4,Lacado,I have always enjoyed reading Max Lacado books. I have found the subject to be down to earthand very entertaining
5,Give it all to HIM by Max Lucado,"Max Lucado is an inspirational writer. His chapters are short (6-7 pages) and very uplifting. What he writes about is always Biblical based, but written in a context easily understood and very relevant to today's world. You don't have to read the whole book to get something out of the experience. Each chapter is self sustaining, whereas you could pick up the book and just read Chapter 9 and it would be enough to go away with something to think about or relate to. Max Lucado writes from the heart. I give him both thumbs up !!!!"
4,excellent,Max Lucado is an excellecent writer. He is truly a man close to God. He can take anything an explain it with Biblical text from days of yore to the present. This book is a very good read.
4,More Orson Scott Card sci fi!,"Orson Scott Card is one of my favorite authors, and in some recent Amazon-surfing, I was delighted to discover this Card novel that I'd never heard of. I got a used copy, and I really enjoyed it. The book is based on the 1989 movie ""The Abyss"" by James Cameron, who did ""Aliens,"" ""Titanic,"" and the ""Terminator"" movies. It's about a deep-sea mission, some cool aliens, and a bunch of interesting people, their relationships, and their deepest personal struggles.(A similar undersea sci fi adventure is Michael Crichton's ""Sphere,"" which I didn't like, but the average customer review is 4.5 stars, so if you're into thrillers, you might like it. And I highly recommend most anything by Orson Scott Card, especially ""Ender's Game,"" one of the best science fiction novels ever, and, if you're into religion, ""Stone Tables,"" which is a novelization of the life of Moses.)"
3,Use Me,"This book was an ok book to read. I enjoyed parts of it, but then in parts it was a little lenghtly, and a little hard to understand. I didn't quit ever figure out all the different characters in the bbok. She was always skiping around from one character to another. She had alot of different names and to make it even harder to understand stand they all had nick names too. I beleive that she could have explained things a little more and given a little better detail in some areas. Especially in the areas where her father had cancer and how it was progressing. I never quite figured out if she was the one who was preganant and had three abortions, or if that was her sister All in all it was an ok book, and I would recomend it if you are a person who can follow alot of different people and not get confused, otherwise I think you would have a hard time understanding it."
4,Very perspective!,"This book has a different point of views from other books with the same theme. It discussed tarot from mathematician perspectives. It also explained minor arcana better, although the card sequence is strange than common ones. Quite a perspective idea which will enhance your tarot reading."
2,Impossible to use,"We used to have this deck and never used it. The Major Arcana are completely confused, their order doesn't even resemble the usual numbers. The book is also terribly complicated, confusing, and includes a lot of material that is utterly inessential to reading tarot. I can handle a pretty deep, complicated and intellectual explanatory book. The Gill Tarot's book, for one. This one makes no sense. Perhaps it would work if you were already an alchemist."
1,Dated material,"Some may think this unfair, so I will be brief. I'd like to find a current edition of something like this. Certainly in the family of Hacking Exposed.... a book on the state of Java (1.2 maybe?) and J2EE (1 maybe?) this book is 8 years old. JEE r6 is out as is Java SE 6, soon to be 7. As for the state of vulnerabilities both new and defeated, that too is a completely different landscape now. It would be wonderful for a text on vulnerabilities based on JEE 6 and JSE 6 or 7."
1,Don't bother!,"I ordered these Merry Hempsters Hemp Lip Balm Spearmint SPF 18 as I am a true believer in hemp products. I am putting together party favors for a destination wedding and thought they would add a nice touch. I received ONE stick of lip balm, but I was expecting a box of 12. The ad is VERY misleading, not specifying the quantity you will receive with the order, showing the description of the item as a full box of product (showing 12 tubes of lip balm in the picture), and the product details specify the shipping weight as 2.1 oz (so it would make sense to expect more then one of the each 0.14 oz tubes of lip balm). Also, the one tube that I did receive did not have a safety seal on it which I thought was odd. I am very disappointed about this order. Also, it was pointless to contact the seller about this matter as they did absolutely nothing for me."
2,Empire Scientific CPH-488B Phone Batteries,"The Delivery Was Fast. They Packaged The (2) Rechargeable Batteries Very Well. But, As For The Batteries Themselves, They Are Not That Great. The Lose Their Charge Very Quickly After Being On The Phone For No More Than Less Than An Hour. Sometimes 30 Minutes. On A Scale From 1 to 10, I Give These Batteries A 3. Not Great Or Long Lasting Rechargeable Batteries."
1,Worked for about a Month.,"The Good: They are compatible.The Bad: They lasted about a month.The Ugly: I bought one to test it first and it worked for a week so I bought two more. Little did I know they would each just drop off within a month of purchasing them.The Summary: I bought one first, then two together and they all died pretty quickly. I wouldn't buy them again. New brand name batteries cost nearly as much as new phones so I'll probably just buy new phones. Funny how that works out isn't it?"
3,It's exactly what they say it is,"This book delivers what it promises -- real SAT IIs. It was helpful to take a real test to gauge how I would do on the real test. The questions were similar but there is so much material in each subject that some of the content was different. However on the bio, I found a few questions that were almost exactly the same.The main problem I had with this book was that it only has 1 test for each subject. Since I only took 3 tests, most of the book was wasted. This book cannot be used alone to review. Its only purpose is to give you an idea of what the test is gonna be like."

2,It's over...,"To me, who tries to stick to it, because I've already bought the last five. This is a big disappointment. A rather weak ending to cap off an great story in my opinion."
3,Sailing shennanigans!,"Few writers have the ability to coonjure the world of competitive yacht racing as well as Llewellyn does. This is not his best, but it still knocks the socks off most of what you would find in an airport bookshop. The sailing de3scriptions, and the adventure is great - the only weakness is in the stereotyping of some goodie and baddie characters. Read it for the sailing."
2,i recently read two books on promoting MP3s -- conclusion,"i recently read two books on promoting MP3s and after some consideration, I think this was the lesser of the two, mainly because of the high cost. You basically pay a lot of money for a glossy cover and some nice pictures. You get the same information, and some better examples, in BUZZ YOUR MP3, an electronic book I discovered here at Amazon. I'm not saying this is a bad book -- it is very well written and the tips are fine -- but why pay so much for this book when you can get something else that is just as good in every way for a lot, lot less? Both books are about using MP3s to further your career. Both are well written. But this one just costs too much. Sorry."
5,My Favorite,"I bought this for my 18 month old. I speak a little Spanish and I wanted her to be exposed to the sounds of languages from an early age. It's a beautiful story, beautiful illustrations, and (as far as I can tell) good translation. It's also really nice that I read it in Spanish and then can read it in English because both are there on the page. LOVE IT!"
3,Quiero a mi Mama Porque...,"Great board book about how animal and human ""mommies"" love their babies. (In Spanish only)"
5,Great book in English and Spanish!,"I bought this book for my great niece, who will be learning both English and Spanish. Thus book honors the love between a child and his/her Mommy. Her mother has enjoyed reading this book to her. I would highly recommend it."
5,perfect for bilingual families,i got this for my neice's christmas present. She comes from a home that speaks spanish and english. i love the fact that i can read it to her in english and her grandmother who speaks no english can read it to her in spanish. we hope it helps her to learn spanish a little easier.
3,"Coven,vol.3 common quality artwork...",Mediocre artwork designed to excite the 12 to 16 year old males. Much of it obviously worked from photographs and the few that weren't are amateurish at best.
5,Yuridia tienes angel,"Yuri, te queremos mucho. Nos encanta tu voz tan fresca y linda. Que sigas triunfando y que Dios te bendiga y acompane. Este CD/DVD contiene las originales reliquias de un gran talento que se inicio en Mexico. Tu musica eres tu Yuridia, cantas con el corazon, alma y con toda tu. Lo reciente del DDE sea por las right reasons. Tus fans en Orange, California"
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!! sin palabras!!!!! Que hermosa voz!!!!,"Yuridia tiene una voz de angel!!! Ella es la mejor cantante que yo e escuchado, apecesar de que solo tiene 20 anos.es fenomenal!!!! si pudiera darle mas de 5 estrallas serian muy merecidas, apecar de que apenas a comensado su carrera con este disco a obtenido mas de QUATRO DISCOS DE PLATINO!!Este dico es super bueno!!El dinero es muy bien gastado en este disco, tenemos que seguir apoyando a Yurridia por que su talento no tiene limites!! Es realmente MAGNIFICA!!!!!!!!!!! Ella tiene un talento y una voz unica!Compren sus discos! Yo estado recomendando este disco a mis amigas y familia y les encanto este disco, muchos de mis amigas americanas, brazilenas, y latinas les encanto muchisimo, y la voz de Yuri las dejo asi como a mi...sin palabras!"
2,Austrian Grenadiers & Infantry,"I was very disappointed with this particular publication, the Grenadiers have been mostly overlooked which for me was hugely disappointing. Anyone looking for information on the Austrian Elite's would be well served by looking at alternative sources of information. Nice colourful plates throughout but on actual substance I found it disappointing."
3,In search of kindred spirits,"The best thing about this book was the interest it sparked in me for adventures I had previously not considered. I'm now seriously thinking of doing two-week learning stints in interesting locations rather than the relaxing visits or typical tourist approach to seeing other cultures and countries.The worst thing about the book was never warming up to the author. I would have liked to feel her a kindred spirit as she seemed to find all over the world, but though I appreciated seeing through her eyes, I never felt an affinity for her as a person."
3,Disappointing sequel,"I agree with the reviewers who said this book is boring. I read it right after ""Without Reservations,"" which I LOVED. The first part about cooking school in Paris was great, but the book went downhill after that. I was interested in Cuba, but the writing was uneven. I love Provence and gardening, but just didn't find that section interesting. When it came to the part about training dogs in Scotland, my eyes literally glazed over and I had to skim the pages. A very disappointing ending.I was hoping to hear more about Naohiro, her romantic interest in the first book, but only got small tidbits. I guess she's saving the rest for the next book. I really hope it's better than this one. Sorry, Alice."
2,"Stick to ""Without Reservations""","I enjoyed reading Alice Steinbach's ""Without Reservations"" immensely that I looked forward to reading this book with the same intensity, but I became disappointed with it towards the middle of the book and I even skipped some of the later chapters because it was making me sleep. I am reading her first book though, ""The Miss Dennis School of Writing and Other Lessons from a Woman's Life"", which is a collection of her articles in the Baltimore Sun."
4,Educating Alice: Adventures of a Curious Woman,Her second book about travel and experiencing life in different countries and places. A great read
1,A lot of reservation.....,"Well, I think taking that writing course in Prague affected Madame Steinbach's ability to tell an engaging story! This book was SOOO boring! I cracked up laughing reading another reviewer's comment that the ""shepherding"" chapter was more boring than the garden one because I had the same impression. I didn't even finish the last chapter. Maybe I should have, it could have helped my insomnia. Frankly, the relationship with Naruhiro makes my skin crawl. The way she writes about this man is not appealing at all.And if she asked one more person in a non-Anglo-Saxon country if they were inspired by an American or English artist, writer, gardener, etc., I thought I would scream. How horribly insulting to other cultures. But that is so American - everything in the world must revolve around them these days. And I know, I am one but thankfully don't live there anymore."
2,Lost Me in the Middle,"Great writer and interesting experiences, but after 150 pages I found I just didn't care enough to continue reading. I also felt like she was taking these journeys not as someone looking to expand herself, but as someone looking for a book deal."
4,"Made with passion, fun to watch","Wages of Sin is an independantly made flick. It's got an intelligent storyline, interesting divers characters and cool martial arts. It's obvious that the film was an ambitious learning-while/by-doing-project. So there are a lot of things one could mention about the insecure novice things that are also part of the movie. But what made me happy about it, is the passion and dedication that Nathyn Masters and his microbudget cast and crew put into this film. That shows. That inspired me. And it entertained me, of course. (Four out of five stars, in its context. Expect the next one to be six out of five.)"
1,Tooo sensitive!,"Great idea but mine kept turning on all the time for no reason. Hell, I could fart around the corner of the doorway and it would turn on. It seems to sense heat to work. lol"
2,Not that good,"Idea is good, no wires, just batteries but it operates only some of the time. I have already stopped using it and plan to take it off my wall soon."
1,~ugh~,"it's an interesting concept, but the didactic overtones get tiring. coupled with its cliched descriptions, it comes across as trying a mite too hard. more a social document than entertaining reading."
5,Walking San Francisco on the Barbary Coast Trail by D. Bacon,"Exceptional book, written with the average Joe-Citizen in mind. We have lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for about 15 year, but never dared to walk San Francisco like this before. Saw this book and realized what an understated gem it was. Maps and Illustrations are fun and helpful, too. Many interesting anecdotes about the city's history and interesting spots. Walk took 6 hours, was invigorating, and amazed after it was over how much we had seen up close and with more knowledge about the sites than ever. Took friends from Australia with us, and they commented that they thoroughly enjoyed the walk, too. Recommend it without reservation. By the way, a few of the other ratings are somehow at ""0"". This throws off the book's ratings from the two (so far) who have rated it at ""5""."
2,"Good ideas, bad fiction","I enjoyed this book overall; I'd happily read nonfiction from this author, and I'd love to see the roleplaying campaign this story is obviously adapted from. (Which puts it above Ed Greenwood's books...not that this is strong praise).That said, the ending is one of the most poorly-designed and anticlimactic set pieces in the history of fiction. Allies and villains pop up and fall down like rodents in a whack-a-mole game, and display about as much depth and character development. Many parts of the plot read like the author came up with them by rolling percentile dice and checking some sort of random adventure table.This is a book I could happily quote from, but not one I could recommend."
3,Ok for the money,"I bought this product so I could reverse mount a 50mm lens to one of my macro lenses. It does the job so I gave it 3 stars. As you would expect for the money it is a cheaply made product from India. The problem I have experienced is that is holds too tightly to the ""receiving"" lens and sometimes requires effort to get it off. That speaks to the below average quality and/or quality control issues somewhere along the line. Yeah you can buy one and be satisfied with it, but it might be hit and miss."
1,Plastic Ends Come Off While Trying To Use This! This Is Way China Shouldn't Make Tools,"Wow, This product is ""Really"" Made In China. I planned to change the spark plugs in my truck this weekend and needed some of these for the type of plugs and such. You should always use these pliers. Well I was not able to find any in my tool box, so I took a chance on these. Not only do the plastic ends come off, the pliers bend while you tug the boots off. Funny, you can bend them right back with your hand, lol. I ended up doing one of the eight plugs; will be waiting til my new USA Made plug boot pliers come in the mail.Buyers have been warned...."
5,Shall We Shop?!,"Crave Seattle provides a neighborhood shopping and playing guide for every cool-girl. Glossy pages filled with yummy pictures of the best, friendliest and sometimes most hard-to-find gems in various neighborhoods in Seattle. You'll find listings of top picks by catagory (spa, worth the drive, etc), along with photos, interviews with the entreprenuers/owners, maps, descriptions and more. I keep one in my glovebox in case I happen upon a neighborhood mentioned and give this book FREQUENTLY to friends both new and familiar with the area. It's the book for anyone who loves shopping as an experience - not just an errand."
1,Not what I expected,"The product listed is not what was shipped to me. Instead I recieved a generic ""no name"" version of a LOLO Ball. I wouldn't recomend ANYONE ordering this product."
2,It stopped already!,"This watch, a Timex Men's Fashion Easy Reader, Two, model number T23811, part number: T238119J was purchased in December as a Christmas gift. The watch stopped working last week.I purchased it from the Amazon .com website and it was sent by Famous Brand Watches. Not what I expected and very disappointed."
3,"Yawn: Unlike the other books, once was enough","This Amelia journal, for the faithful follower, feels hacked out. It doesn't have the same verve or interesting characters that usually bounce off the pages. These books are so great to look at but the theme this time is how our usually strong Amelia tries to change her look to be popular, risking friends in the process. The book lacked its usual spunk. Hopefully Amelia will bounce back and launch into adolescence a little more like her old self."
5,Apparitions of the Virgin Mary,Amazing book concerning the Marian apparitions of the 19th and 20th centuries concerning the messages delivered by Mary to chosen souls about possible punishments from God to men for their sins. I've read most books covering the appearances of Our Lady but this one has to be the best on the subject. The author gives some early history of the sufferings of the Roman Catholic Church from the Islam invasion to the Protestant Reformation and how the Catholic Church dealt with all these turmoils. Prophecies are explained as to not BS you about how God is offended by our sinfulness. Great reading and every appearance from Guadelupe to Medjugorje are all covered as well. Highly recommended and one book you'll not soon put down once you start reading it.
4,Old/New information on a very delicate subject,"While the author is a bit excentric, that needs to be overlooked to really understand the valuable information in this book. It's time that the Swastika be given back the respect it deserves and earned in the 10,000 plus years that it has existed. Adolph Hitler was only a blip in the history of this symbol of good luck, success and wisdom. I became interested in the history of the Swastika while studying Buddhism and Native American symbology. It was the first Christian cross, it was Hebrew and the American Indians used it for hundreds of years until Hitler cast a shadow over it. It's time to remove the stigma from an innocent symbol and realize that Hitler adopted it for the same reasons. Success, power and protection."
4,American Eyes,"I just saw American Eyes this past weekend at the Taste of Chaos Tour in Camden, NJ. I really thought they put on a good show so I bought their CD after they played and the band was nice enough to sign it. The songs are good - real upbeat. My only complaint about the CD is that is only has 6 songs! I'll definately be looking for this band in the future to see what they come out with next."
1,Worst CD and Band,"I saw this band with Go Betty Go and Bronson and Rock Kills Kid at the Troubadour in LA I bought Go Betty Go, Bronson's and Rock Kills kid's CD that night because they rocked but I was out of money and I couldn't buy American eyes's CD that night but I bought it here on amazon but I got to say that I wish I hadn't. It really sucks. It sounds like they are trying too hard and fall short. Maybe the next album will be better but for now stay away from it because it will be a waste of money."
2,I'm Just Doing This To Be The First One... Don't Like Em Much,"I listened to three of their songs on myspace. Before I listened to their music, I went to cdnow.com and went to see who they sounded like... and one of them was alkaline trio... one of my favorite bands. I then quickly played one of them and the guitars were really cool, but then the voice came in; the voice of the new punk scene. The band can be good, but the singer has that voice which this new punk scene uses... a sound I can't stand... soo... I am giving it two stars (...)"
4,Perfect for Hip Replacement - Watch toilet lip size,"Did a lot of looking for a raised seat before hip replacement. Glad I got this one.Pros: Handles are a must have. Give stability up and down.Can handle my 270 pound frame size with arms in out-most position.No-slip pads on back anchor well.High enough lift to be comfortable with hip and not over-flex.Does not require removing existing seat (although it is not functional).Inside walls are deep enough to keep splashes and plops inside toilet.Cons: MEASURE YOUR TOILET LIP. MINE WAS OVER 1 3/4"", AND SEAT DID NOTFIT. WAS ABLE TO REVERSE FRONT CLAMP AND GIVE ENOUGH STABILITY TOUSE SAFELY. IF YOU HAVE A THICK TOILET LIP, YOU WILL HAVE FIT ISSUES.Other than fit (toilet is round, but with thick lip), this is a perfect seatfor hip patents."
2,Doesn't work on elongated toilet,"I bought this to use after having hip replacement surgery. The description said that it would fit an elongated toilet seat but it did not fit mine securely at all. I attempted to return it because it wasn't cheap but the seller wanted to charge me 2 way shipping which would have cost me almost as much as the item did in the first place, so I just donated the seat to an assisted care facility near me."
3,toilet seat,Had knee replacement & needed something like this product. From the picture it looked comfortable. Forget it. I think the raised seat is too small. Had to rtn.
3,OK from a distance,The doe decoy would be OK to give deer a comfort feeling from a distance. Deer actually spooked when they saw it from 30 to 40 yards.
2,you get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for . I bought this last year , i cant believe i paid 35 for a piece of lexon .Sometimes we do strange things in desperation .Deer didnt even look at it let alone come closer to me . I may use it for a target"
4,compact deer decoy,This decoy looks real from a distance. Folds flat for easy transport. Time will tell how well it holds up in field use in harsh windy/wet conditions. The price is the best I've found. So far I am pleased with this product.
4,Helpful,"I found this book essential for the IPOD novice that I was when I bought both my IPOD and this book. Apple doesn't supply (yes I was quite shocked over that, especially since I had there top of the line IPOD)a manual with the IPOD I purchased. So I felt lost in terms of information and purchased this book. I found it to be very helpful and thus far has addressed and/or guided me through any problem or need for information that I have come across. A must for anyone with an IPOD put out by Apple."
3,Pretty comprehensive!,"I enjoyed it, but then of course I don't own an iPod and don't download music, I was simply curious what all the excitement is about. Clearly the product(s) evolve very rapidly, and so MAYBE this book is already out of date, but honestly I don't know."
3,don't really know what to say,"Woman of integrity is the story of tantra, just tryin to make it through every day life. Tantra is faced with saddness when she loses her mother. Tantra's father that she never knew comes into her life only to disappoint her. An overall good read, but i felt it could have been a little more drama."
4,Good for the price,System works well with my Sony cam recorder and my old Venturer karaoke system. Was surprised at the range (30 meters) and clarity of sound. A good easy to use system for the cost conscious buyer.
2,Headset wireless microphone,I ordered this product in keeping with the brand namewe are using. When installing it we picked up thelocal radio station and could not filter it out.Also too much noise in the unit.Charles Anderson
2,Pretty noisy,too noisy to use in any kind of recording or live sound situation. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,These are not stereo,After purchasing and using these they only record on one channel in Mono. The fact the description mentions stereo many times and they are not is very disapointing.
1,cord,"I bought the cord because it was a recomended purchase........I could not find any information as to how to use it, so have returned the cord......."
5,Memorable,"I bought this cd a number of years ago and loved the music so much I felt I had to get the complete quartets, eventually finding the Fitzwilliam Quartet's complete edition on Decca. Though good, that edition made me realise the beauty of the Moyzes Quartet's account. The selection too of the 2nd and 4th is an excellent one, these being two of the most beautiful penned by Shostakovich. Though Lydian is a bargain label, this is a fine disc with intimate, heart-wrenching playing and for me is the one I go back to again and again. And of course that music!"
1,This book is awful,"I bought this book based on all the positive reviews I read here. I've never been so misled by reviews on Amazon.com before. My 13-month-old daughter will typically sit on my lap for 20-30 minutes at a time while we read board book after board book. She has zero interest in this book. In fact, it was on the coffee table the other day and she passed it over to sit and look at the pictures in National Geographic. The rhythm is not interesting, the hand gestures are boring and difficult to demonstrate while reading and looking at the pictures -- and speaking of pictures, the illustrations are horrible. My daughter is usually delighted with any book having to do with babies. Well, the babies illustrated in this book are obese (not cutely plump, but acutally lumpy), with huge heads and freakishly small hands and feet. There are so many great board books out there (Dr. Seauss's Foot Book was a hit with both my kids); don't waste your money on this one."
4,A very short book,"Due to the shortness of this book, my daughter prevailed upon me to read it more often. It's very cute though."
3,Sweet and wishing for more with this type of book.,Nice rhyme and wonderful pictures for babies to see. Wish it had more substance to it.
2,couold be better,"This is a finger play for babies and toddlers. I bought it to have at home for when my granddaughters visit. The book is cute enough, but there is just not ""enough"" meat to this book to justify a whole book for one finger play. I do like that the musical notes are provided, so that I can play the song on the piano. Just wish there were a couple other songs/finger plays."
5,Great book!,"I bought this book for my 8 month old and she loves to pat the pages as I read. It's easy for moms to memorize, too, but not so monotonous that you'd get sick of it the 10th time!"
5,Very cute book!,This is a very cute book! I'm 8 months pregnant and my husband has been reading this book to my belly for the past few months. The baby already loves it but i'm sure she'll love it even more when she can hold daddy's hands with her own 10 little fingers!
4,My son loves this book and mimics the pictures,"My son was about 12 months old when we bought this book and he loved it. The pages are big and thick with nice colors. Reading it out a loud and acting out the story was thoroughly enjoyable. The only complaint I would have is that it's a really short story, so we tend to re-read it several times before moving on to the next book."
3,Very simple,"These books are nice, but super super simple. I got them for my 2 year old, and it's more appropriate for a younger child. It is just the song written out of a few pages. Not worth the price, I would check the series out from the library instead."
2,Not interesting,"The fingers didn't ""do"" much even for a baby. Would have liked if they were counting something or doing more with other parts of the body."
5,Ten Little Fingers (Board Books for Babies),First baby book and my girl has liked it since she was two months old!
2,ten little fingers,"This is ok, but if you are looking for great board books, try the touchy feely books like That's Not My Puppy, That's Not My Teddy. They excite a baby much more."
3,Ten Little Fingers,The shipping fee is about same as the book price itself. That will end up about double price of a children book.
4,applique made easy,This is a great 'idea' book. The how-to section is quite helpful for beginners and a nice refresher for the more advanced.
5,Great Book for Hikes,"I liked this book so much I bought it again when my cat peed on the first copy. I appreciate the time the authors took to write down the history, really makes the trail even more interesting.Sometimes it's hard to figure out where the turn off is but that is more likely due to the trail maintenance than the book itself (or user error).All in all, a great guide for walking Rochester trails."
4,Good hiking book,"The book is a has many trails I never hear of. It rates them and gives a little history about the trail. I wished I bought it earlier. I bought it used and was a very good value, the only damage was the corners of the cover, the rest was in new condition."
2,A Forgettable Novel,"I read this book last week and I've already forgotten everything. Pretty interesting at times, but otherwise belongs to the long line of mundane Star Trek novels"
4,Best Star Trek novel that Carmen Carter has written so far.,"This Star Trek novel is one of those that were published initially as a hard cover. Thus, it appears that more research, re-writing and flair were included compared to Carmen's earlier works.An original storyline brings out the true essance of Picard. Thus we are given a novel that entertains us as a novel, not just another Star Trek novelization.Put this one towards the top of your Star Trek ""list to read""."
4,2 Hearts Collide,Captain Picard's artificial heart and a legendary heart of awesome power collide. Is there an attraction. The best defenses and wit of the Enterprise are called upon to safe the Alpha Quadrant from the mystical effects of this Devil's Heart
4,It grows on you,"I used to not really like this album, but the more I listen to it, the more I do. It has that effect. Nearly every song on here is worth listening to multiple times, and while it's not a masterpiece by any stretch, the overall product is very good.Micky has, in my opinion, the best cuts on here, with ""Heart And Soul,"" ""I'd Go The Whole Wide World,"" ""Don't Bring Me Down,"" and ""Secret Heart"" being particularly good.Davy's highlight is ""The Long Way Home,"" but there isn't any objectionable cut that he sings.Peter has two songs on here--""Gettin' In"" and ""Since You Went Away,"" which is quite humorous, to tell the truth.Overall, the album is quite representative of late 80's pop and it's done well by three guys who were very good at singing it in the 60's. If you're expecting the same sounds as 1967, you'll be disappointed, but you'll probably end up liking ""Pool It!"" anyway. Regardless of what I've said about it before."
3,GROOVY,"I loved this album! My favorite song is, "" Midnight. "" Micky sings this one well. I also loved, "" Counting On You. "" That song is the best."
3,Don't expect good video quality on the DVD,I already had the original release Rhino CD of this title and replaced it only for the DVD in this set. Did Rhino hide the video master? It looks like it was mastered from an old videocassette! My old LaserDisc had a better picture. What a disappointment.
1,This is without a doubt the WORST Monkees album ever!,"ANY of the Monkees' 60's albums are better than this synthesized garbage. As with most albums, there are a couple of highlights (Heart & Soul, Every Step of the Way & Gettin' In). But even those song aren't good enough to merit buying this album. The songs lack any heart, and is mixed in such a way that any melody the songs may have had are overtaken by overpowering, 80's style synthetic sounding drums. What suprises me about Rhino's reissue is that they didn't include their other songs of the era as bonus tracks(That Was Then, This Is Now; Anytime, Anyplace or Anywhere & Kicks)--ALL of which are better than any songs found on this album. If you MUST have a reunion album, stick with Justus(which features Mike), but I STRONGLY prefer Pleasant Valley Sunday any day."
5,pool it,"this cd is just great, loved it from the start, its catchy and its the Monkees as we love them, thoughwithout Mike. and as a bonus there is also the dvd."
4,Redpepper1952,"Pool It! Don't Drown it!I find that the songs are all catchy and great sounding tunes ie. She's moving in with Rico, Heart and soul, Long way home,(I'll) love you forever, Gettin In and Since you went away...Peter's two contributions.The music is fresh and is of a excellent timbre to say the least.As far as anyone doing any reviews on any Monkees works, do us all a favour and please be at least 45 years old. Otherwise, chances are that you are incapable of grasping and understanding their music. I am mid 50's and have NEVER heard a badly sung or done Monkees song. I honestly do not believe they are capable of that,they are above that and would never settle for anything less.Maybe it is regrettable that Mike Nesmith is not featured as such, but most of us know and understand his reasons why."
2,It's Amazing!,"Amazing that anyone would consider this a worthy Monkees album. There are two, maybe three tracks that are decent enough to have been album cuts in their heyday. The rest are bad, generic pap, most done in that 80s style that hasn't held up well at all, has it? This is nothing but a quickie made to cash in on their popular reunion tour."
3,Silly,"I bought this cd when it first came out and I was a Monkees fanatic. At the time(I was 15), I thought this cd was great and couldn't get enough of it. Years later, in giving it another listen, I have changed my opinion. These songs aren't horrible, but just silly."
1,80'S HORROR,"Quite possibly the worst album ever made. Prepare to hear a group you love (?) tarnish their canon and their flaky reputation almost beyond repair. They tried to be contemporary ... and sadly succeeded. The trouble being that this was 1986 - a year when the majority of pop music, film, fashion and virtually every mainstream cultural arena was devoid of any talent or taste. How on earth did The Monkees fit in so perfectly? 'Pool it' languishes in a digital MOR hell, that from the makers of 'Pisces...' and 'Headquarters' is still nothing less than shocking."
3,Cheap copy of some great material,"When I saw that Heart and Soul was included on this ""Deluxe Edition"" I was excited to replace my VHS copy and have a second Pool It! CD. I was hugely disappointed when it came. The cover is a grainy copy of the original. One photo from the extensive original liner notes was included. The discs are generic. Worst of all, Heart and Soul seems to be just a straight copy of the VHS. I could have done that myself! The menu is basic and it's not divided into chapters. You'd think that with the Monkees' material being in high demand again that Rhino could have put a little effort into it. I could have done this whole project at home on my computer.That being said, I'm sorry to give it only three stars because Pool It! is really a great album and Heart and Soul is a fun video. I only wish this reissue had been done right."
3,Love is a puzzle you need a solution to play.,"This is the Monkees comeback album from 1987. Micky, Peter and Davy participated in it, but Mike did not. It's not a great album, but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be. Certainly, ""Heart and Soul"" is a great song that should have been a hit. I am also quite fond of both of Peter's songs, ""Gettin' In"" and ""Since You Went Away"". And there are some other good songs, like ""Whole Wide World"" and ""Every Step of the Way"". But then, Davy has to throw in a couple of unbearably drippy ballads (""Love You Forever"" and ""Counting on You""). And Micky's song ""Midnight"" is pretty bad, too. Other than that, it's a pretty good album, although it leans a bit too heavily on keyboards in an attempt to make it sound ""modern"", which 20 years later just makes it sound more dated."
4,jazz classic,Simply one of the great records of the time; therefore important music from leaders in that era.
1,Incompatibility issue....,"I have no doubts that this is a great product, if you're running a Windows system or Mac OS 9. But, I found out the hard way that it is (currently) NOT compatible with Mac OSX (I'm running 10.2.3) -- it caused a serious kernal panic forcing me to reboot.Incidentally, when I booted my system into OS9.2, the card adapter worked beautifully -- I was able to read and write to my compactflash cards very quickly, without a hitch.I just wanted to alert any OSX users about the incompatibility since sytem requirements are not listed for this item."
3,Works sort of ...,"Fast shipping! This product sort of works. I'd been having ants in my kitchen and I didn't want to use anything around food that would be toxic so I order this product. I sprayed it on the ants and it did kill them but it took a little longer than traditional bug spray. The ants would still be alive for a few minutes after spraying them with this so the ants would crawl around and keeping coming until the product kicked in. The smell is pleasant and it doesn't leave a greasy sticky mess. I haven't tried it on any other insects, but black ants and I haven't tried it outdoors, just indoors. It's not a permanent solution to bug control. Eventually the ants kept coming into my kitchen and I had to call an exterminator. I'd recommend this product if you have just a couple of little bugs you want to get rid of and you don't want any toxic sprays around food, children or pets. Otherwise, for a large infestation or reoccurring infestation, this product doesn't really help with that."
5,TBM is finally here.,"After independantly releasing two albums, TBM has finally found home with Metropolis in North America. This new mix will be sure you blow your mind. TBM's music contains a mix of style anywhere from metal, to pop. If you like bands like Kill Hannah, Vanity Beach, and Deadsy, TBM is right down your alley.Go buy it....NOW! =]"
5,A Passage Way,"Violet is an inspired crafting of all that can make our ears a special portal to the mind. Carrying both the darkness and hope that life must share, their soundscapes seductively brush those hidden corners of latent emotions and shadowed images. Indulge with measured doses and you will be permitted to restart the journey at will.Paul M - Michigan"
5,The Birthday Massacre !!!,"I love this band... My Wife and I saw them live at the Culture Room in Ft.Lauderdale Florida and they Rock! Violet is a great album especialy for anyone who likes Industrial Rock, Trance, or Dance Music...TRACK LIST1. Prologue2. Lovers End3. Happy Birthday4. Horror Show5. Violet6. Red7. Play Dead8. Blue9. Video Kid10. The Dream11. Black12. Holiday13. Nevermind"
5,For anyone who is unsure of their place or purpose in life.,"This book was just excellent. My family laughed at the title. They thought it was just another ""get rich"" book. It is much more than that. It is too soon to tell, I just finished reading it, but this book may change my life. Not many books can do that."
2,Not very detailed information.,Not as much information for each state as I was hoping for. There are better sources available that are currently on the market.
1,Sent an Outdated Edition,"I have the 2 prior editions of this book and ordered the newest edition as gun laws are in a constant state of change.They sent me a 2007 edition in 2012.Useless, as I already owned a 2009 edition."
1,"Waste of trees, time, toil.","Beat poetry was the low point of American literature. Don West failed at even being a mediocre beat poet, his work survives only to feed the egos of his heirs. Better work is produced every day with the Magnetic Poetry tiles at your local Starbucks.One star is two too many, but that's as low as Amazon allows."
4,My Review,"I thought it was wonderful to teach younger, and in some cases irresponsible, children. It helps you keep up to date on all things needed to keep your pup healthy, safe, and happy. I, as a child who borrowed it from a friend, loved the reminder I was and still am responsible with my dog(s)."
4,Kid review,"I don't have one yet,but it sounds great.I have two dogs and am a big animal lover, so I'm going to get it."
2,This is an Extremely Peculiar and Odd Thing,i did not buy this yet but upon further consideration i believe that it is weird and strange and i am not going to buy it unless someone gives it to me for free in which case i will throw it in the garbage or possibly bury it in a hole in my back yard.
3,Good for the money,"This holds my 42 inch reflector perfectly, but it's very confusing with little directions on how you need to attach it to a light stand or tripod. This piece is just the bracket that holds the reflector, it does need to be attached to something. It doesn't really fit my light stand very good, so it's pretty wobbly."
2,Preferred the Manfrotto reflector holder,"Does the job. Seems to work just fine except a little cheap. The whole thing was squeaky when adjusting and did not feel very solid. I was afraid it might break at some point with too much tightening and had ordered the Manfrotto reflector at the same time. I tried both out and was so much more pleased with the Man, that I decided to keep that one instead. Unfortunately for me, the restocking fee on the Adorama reflector (since I had it for too long) was about half the price of the thing so I'm currently stock with both."
4,Nice and it works,"The item was very interesting. Didn't get any sort of instructions but I guess it didn't require being a genius either. The only challenge I had was in attaching it to a stand, the holes were a little bigger than the stand's diameter. Otherwise, it held the reflector strongly."
2,different from picture,"the bracket mailes to me was different from picture, seems like it was assembled from spare parts, the arm holder doesn't connect with gear, it uses friction instead with a rubber pad. apart from this issues it can hold my reflector in portrait or landscape form."
3,"50% worked, 50% broke on first use","The reflector clamps and extension tube all work as desired. However, the adjustable clamp for attaching the extension tube to a light stand (or similar rod) broke upon first use. It is a double clamp for tightening onto two poles, (bracket and stand). Now only one side tightens and I have to use tape to position and secure the other side."
3,Awkward mounting to stand,"It works, but getting the mount to attach properly to a light stand (or other mount) is VERY awkward."
4,A book fit for a King?,"The Presley Arrangement by Monte Wayne Nicholson is an interesting tale of fictional characters who discover the faked death of Elvis Presley. The book is well written and fairly ""Believable?"" Any Elvis Fan would enjoy reading this book of fantisy about Elvis being alive. The cover and overall production is poor. The cover looks like it was made on a home computer and the book is bound by a plastic binder again something someone could make at home. Although it is not much to look at, the story is interesting and intriguing. Long live the ""KING"" T.C.B."
3,"Adequate, But Very Light Gauge","The aluminum is very light gauge, and will probably not distribute the heat uniformly. It is quite flimsy. I have an older Mirro pan of the same size. It is much heavier, and distributes the heat very uniformly.As another comparison, I looked at the Coleman version in a retail store. It is slightly larger diameter, and just as thin and flimsy. I'll stick with my old Mirro pan."
1,Buyer Beware of Dimensions,"We own 8 mid-century modern dinning room chairs that needed new black leg tips. We measured the outside dimension of the leg and they equaled 5/8"". We went to our local hardware retailer and all they had was 5/8"" tips in white. We purchased them, tried them, they fit perfectly, but white looked horrible. So we went to Amazon found these at a great price, ordered them, and they arrived two days later; Perfect. The only problem is that when we tried to put them on, they were two big and fell off. Upon measuring their inside diameter of these tips, they are 3/4"" despite the package stating 5/8"" of an inch. So we returned them.Please beware"
3,Management of Knowledge in Project Environments,"This book has lots of useful information on KM and PM, however it is rather too academic. If you are looking for something that is more of an easier read, this isn't it. Its many chapters are more a collection of academic research papers filled with references to other works."
4,Quite good,"This is much less painful and stinging than the original formula. It is a bit more sticky and has a strange odor when you first put it on. Haven't seen any difference in effect than the original. But, again, it is MUCH less painful."
1,Dull,"What can I say? LIAR is repetitive, unimaginative and, in short dull. Hardly worth the time it takes to read."
3,"Amusing little book...some clever, some silly though.","Fun little book...I obtained a copy for $1, so I did get my money's worth"
4,A very interesting book,"Well written and ilustrated, with very good insight on the development of the V2. A must have for everyone who wants to know something about one of Hitlers ""revenge"" weapons or for the kit modeller."
1,memoirs of madness is horrid,I found thatt the author was more intent on making himself sound like a literary genious than with telling a story that others could find meaning in. He was overly verbose to the point of making one nauseaous! His constant use of french had no point but to point out his own puffed up sense of himself. the book had very little good content on depression or any description of what other than a hospital stay helped to pull him out of his madness. As a person who suffers with depression i found the book had no merit
1,Darkness Denied,The book is indeed a whimpered bit of cognitive self-consciousness and its pages are mine stripped of every emotion save self-pity which sours the narrative and it becomes infamously redundant after page ten.Chris Roberts
2,Blah Blah Blah,"I really did not enjoy this book. I had heard such great things about it, and how moving it was suppose to be, and how it's suppose to really captivate what it's like inside the depressed persons mind, but I just felt bored throughout the entire short book. I was required to read it for my course on Suicide, but, I felt like the author could have done a much better job considering their obvious ability to write. I was very bored and felt myself spacing out through most of it and having to go back and reread what I had already read. That's the worst!"
1,A disappointing glimpse into depression,"While Styron is a wonderful and insightful writer, this account of his depression stays on the surface of his problem, and he never really allows readers into his troubled world. His detached analysis of his journey seems somewhat clinical and not very personal at all. For a very personal glimpse into depression, I would suggest reading AN UNQUIET MIND instead."
4,Deep Understanding,"This book gives a deep insight into Depression. Knowing that someone can be that ""far gone"" and come back is so inspiring. A knowledgeable read!"
3,Fell short of expectations,"William Styron is a fine writer, but this book is flawed as a memoir of his depression. While he is capable of poetically articulating the experience of someone in the throes of this illness (perhaps for some, this is reason enough to read Darkness Visible), he seems more concerned with placing himself in the exclusive company of literary giants who have ultimately commited suicide. Details of his recovery are scrappy and presented cursorily and efforts to ridicule practitioners of certain forms of therapy are a diversion and diminish the work as a whole."
5,Moving description of depression relating true understanding,This moving description helps even non-sufferers of the disease to better understand the feelings of those who struggle with depression. It offers some hope for the future and a reason to hang in there and support loved ones who have given up on themselves
4,Required reading,This book should be required reading for everyone who is close to someone suffering from depression. Mr. Styron's description of his illness sheds light on what depression is really like in a way that most depressed people can't articulate. Read it during the depression so you can better understand what your loved one is feeling.
2,Disappointing,"It would be lovely to believe that depression can be cured as it was for him. That all it takes is hanging in there long enough, and eventually it will go away. I can appreciate that this author feels that having gone thru what he did, that he knows what he is talking about, but sadly he doesn't. I don't know if his depression was a result of alcoholism. The way he writes, I don't think so, I think that the alcoholism was a result of the depression. I also don't think you are ever ""cured"" from depression -- it will always linger in the back of your mind, waiting....."
3,"It's true, but it certainly doesn't make darkness visible.","I speak from experience when I say that what the author has written is true. But, if the author hoped to convey to a reader a sense of the experience of depression, then the author has failed--for the book has no life. There is a strange loop here in that this flat, lifeless quality IS profoundly a quality of depression. But this is not a desirable quality in writing, for it conveys none of the horror of being someone in the midst of depression."
4,Valuable but a trifle irritating,"Darkness Visible is a useful book (a long magazine article really) for those who want an overview of the terrible illness depression. In describing his own bout with depression, the great novelist William Styron discusses the rhythm of this illness, its treatment, its effects, and pervasiveness, all useful to the lay person who wants to learn something fast about depression. For this service and its powerful prose, I heartily recommend this book. At the same time, I did find Styron a trifle smug, since he presents himself as superior to his doctors and their treatment and seems to know only famous people (beside himself) who suffer from this disease. I was happy for Styron's recovery but found the man's pomposity annoying."
3,Depressing,"There is redemption in this tale, but be warned that this is an incredibly depressing work. It is amazing that Styron could capture his story so well and in such a moving way. I struggled to work through this because of how hard it is to read about his experiences. (Also, I acknowledge other readers that, at times, Styron can be pretentious. However, I feel that he remains true to himself while describing his life)."
5,a way with words,"Styron has an in depth knowledge of what it is like to live with a demon known as depression. He adequately shares what the demon does and how it makes life sometimes impossible to get through each day and ultimately, if treated improperly or not at all, the ultimate down side to it is the loss of life."
5,If you're reading this now it's a good idea to buy this book,"If you've tracked down this book, you are probablywondering if you or someone you know is battlingdepression. If this is the case, you will not find amore thoughtful, more profound, or more lucid anintroduction to the subject of the ravages ofdepression than this. It offers the solace ofshared experience and the quiet strength of asurvivor. It is a book to be re-read over and overagain and cherished for the hard truths it shows"
4,Short and honestly descriptive account,"Since I have suffered from depression, I can relate to this book in many ways. For me, it is uplifting in ways to hear an accout of another who has suffered in similar ways and to ultimately hear of his triumph over the disease. He describes the disease well, emphasing how difficult it is to exaplain to others the terrible disabilitating effects of the disease.It is good that this book is a short, easy reader that does not waste time. The personal accounts are great. Lets others know they are not alone."
2,Not Impressed,"As a fan of Wlliam Styron's fiction and a fellow depressive, I began reading this book with high hopes. It is a quick read, an essay really, that chlonicles Styron's struggle with depression at age 60.When I finished the book, I was beyond disappointed. In the book he does nothing to describe how his actual "" recovery"" came to be.. He talks of his hospitalization... but he says group therapy didn't help... he made somewhat sacastic remarks about art therapy..and he doesn't really express too much regarding medication that worked for him...So... I believe I expected something different. I expected a book that would fill me, as a depressive, with hope and fellowship... My expectation was WAY too high.I would not recommend this book. I would especially not recommend this book to someone who is suffering from depression."
5,Very nice.,I thought I would'nt get anything out of this book because he's so much older than me but I really enjoyed it a lot. I got a different perspective on depression from someone older.
1,Narcissism to the tenth power.,"It's been said already in other reviews, but Styron clearly romanticizes his depression and applies a kind of artistic elitism to depression that exlcudes those who don't live a so-called ""creative"" life. (Styron regularly appears on television with other ""artists"" and Mike Wallace, the journalist, a kind of unspoken code: this is about ""creative types."") This is a very small book with very little to offer. He talks a lot about his alcoholism but fails to connect his many years of drinking with his depression. Of course, it is known that alcohol is a depressant and, like other drugs, kills brain cells and diminishes the brain, in general. There's a part of Styron at work that embraces his depression. He identifies with it and, I believe, his writing this slight essay was his way of keeping it. I found the book redundant, slow, at times unclear, and offering, quite frankly, nothing of value."
3,More about the recovery,"I would liked to have read more about Styron' s recovery. As a deeply depressed person, I have found all methods of medication treatment useless. The notes on older drugs are helpful. I wonder what it was about the hospital that turned him around."
2,Critique of Darkness visible,"The author did not offer any insights, such as specific symptoms or specific approaches to improvements. It essentially tells the reader that depression got worse after sobriety, but then got better. No insights for reader to take away."
4,A Help in times of shadows....,"For a man, especially an author out of the Southern Tradition, to come clean about his personal conflicts, his struggles to purge the daemonic elements within his psyche, and to create a viable work of semi-autobiography I find this book to be honest, straightforward, and full of exemplum for all who have faced the dark realms of despression."
5,Thanks is not enough,"I can't thank William Styron enough for this book. Suffering from depression myself, I had days in which I was counting breaths just to make it through the day. This book got me through another day in the darkest of places."
4,Interesting First-Hand Account of Severe Depression,"This autobiography of William Styron dives into his own experience with severe depression. Although he was winning critical acclaim as an author, he went further and further into depression to the point of hopelessness and suicide. The book gives a great account of his personal experience and how he was able to recover and find happiness in his life again. Very interesting to hear about a much overlooked disease from the viewpoint of someone who has been there."
5,Gripping first-hand account of dealing with depression...,"For someone who has had and lost a loved one to depression, this is a very compelling read. I have re-read it a number of times...and continue to go through the ""what-ifs"" of my son's depression."
4,Into the dark,"In this slim volume, William Styron documents his descent into near-suicidal depression and his eventual recovery to something near normalcy. He eloquently describes his condition, and discusses some things about depression and how it's sometimes different for each individual. By telling of his journey, he offers a sense of hope through the depths of depression. I do wish this book were longer, if only to hear more about his battle and to see more clearly the path he walked."
4,"stark, pragmatic, informed, feeling, hopeful","""Darkness Visible"" is an 85 page essay about Mr. Styron's experience with depression, a condition that nearly killed him, as it has so many writers and artists and others. His little book is stark and pragmatic, deeply informed and feeling, without a hint of self pity, and indeed, with no small measure of hope. As someone who's felt this particular woe, I found the topic resonant and grievous, and a call to arms, to recognise depression as serious a disease as any other, one that we cannot always explain or treat, and most of all, to stop treating suicide as shameful blameful acts."
4,"Taut, honest, illuminating","Personal-account articles and books on this topic abound, but Styris' succinct account of his own descent into, and eventual rise from, the living hell of clinical depression is better written and more effective than most. Jargon-free, honest and eminently readable. Suspect the title for this understated gem may have been his publisher's idea!"
4,Am I losing my mind?,The book describes the symptoms of depression from the viewpoint of one who has experienced it. It does not attempt to explain the 'why' but rather gives the 'what'. If you want to know what someone suffering from depression feels and thinks then this is the book for you.
5,depression is madness not sadness,"When I read Darkness Visible, I was in a 14-16 day black hole of madness and depression. Styron's memoir moved me to begin exploring more deeply and honestly the degree of loss I have experienced in my life and how it has affected me mentally. The book helped lift me out of the my dark bout. Later it helped me be more open and knowledgeable with both a colleague and a student suffering from depression. I gave Styron's book to both of them. They were both very grateful and both passed the book on to others. I was especially happy that my student enjoyed the book -- from the point when she read it until the end of the quarter she seemed liberated, more confident, and certainly more open. I think Styron opened her eyes to possibilities for herself as a sufferer of depression that she hadn't seen before."
4,Excellent and informative,"My husband suffers from depression and this book helped me to understand how he might be feeling. At only 80 pages, it is written in a clear, concise manner that offers hope to everyone who reads it. Excellent!"
4,Understanding the darkness!,"Styron describes depression through his eyes and we walk into the visible darkness. Depression is very difficult to describe in words, but he certainly did a good job in doing so;...that it even reminded me of my own experiences. Is that good or bad? Well, it's terrible to be reminded of your own experiences, but I chose to read the book to understand more Depression and other points of views of solving the problem. This book doesn't go into depth about solving depression, but it does give good insight on the symptoms (although each person may experience it differently, but there are similarities)."
3,From a depressive's perspective: Superficial,"OK, Styron covered the important themes of depression: confusion, insomnia, desperation... but he didn't really let out much of his own torture of dealing with this disease. This book was highly touted to me, and perhaps that was why it was a disappointment. I preferred _Undercurrents_ as a testimony to being in the throes of depression."
1,A Mercutio Madness,"I suffer from depression, and I certainly don't mean to belittle Mr. Styron's painful experience with the illness. But I read his portrayal of that experience with the same kind of horror that one might feel when a family member gets drunk and ruins a party. ""Say, isn't that your brother over there?"" ""Who him? No!"" I felt Styron was pompous in the rendering of his suffering, eager to use his illness to prove his depth, his brilliance, and his place with great writers. A Mercutio madness, to be sure, and, finally, an empty memoir."
3,Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness by William Styron,"Well written and researched. However, only 90 pages no where near enough to explain the true depth of depression. I would, however, recommend this to people who need to get an idea of what depression is and what some misconceptions are."
3,"I wrote a 5-Star review of this book a couple of years ago,","and since then, I've re-read it and learned a bit more about its author. As you can see, my present opinion of the book is that it rates 3-Stars.What have I learned about William Styron since I wrote my first review? Mainly, that he was a rather typical southern alcoholic-writer whose real claim to fame is his big historical-fiction book about Nat Turner's confessions. And Darkness Visible (itself?) was a too-hasty compilation of Styron's own confessions - and of course, us depressives take comfort wherever we get it and are incredibly appreciative of any Great Writer being able to get anything down in writing.So be it. EVERYONE who has never been clinically depressed should read this book. But a great book about depression awaits its author."
3,It's about archives!,"None of the other reviewers has mentioned that the main plot (or one of them) is about the fight between scholars who seek knowledge by looking in archives and measuring orbits and so on, and those who read the authorities and don't trust anyone who goes beyond them; there's also politics, and sex, and The King Must Die stuff, and magic, and nobles and scholars and revolutionaries and lecture-halls and ballrooms and sacred groves and more sex. When Basil St. Cloud, Doctor of History, asks his students to go into the University Archives to look for original sources, one student reacts: ""This was scholarship with a vengeance, scholarship with teeth. This was the most important thing that had ever happened to him."""
3,Not the best read...,"I read this book before I read Swordpoint so I had nothing to compare it to when I read it. This book starts off promisingly. We are introduced to potentially interesting characters and an interesting premise. However, about half way thru the story, all the promise unravels. The potentially interesting charas are either dropped or become extremely 2D. Basil and Thereon,, the two main charas in the story trully become flat and uninteresting. By the time this story ends you are like, what? 400 + pages for this? Anyway, I went back and read Swordpoint and that book was much better...much better."
4,All about me!,I loved this book - and yet I hated the ending - but I'd still recommend it. Weird huh...I think I hated it because for nearly the whole book I get to be inside Theron and Basil's heads - but then - nothing. The major climactic moment and I don't get them from the inside - and almost even cursorily from the outside.I hated that.Yet I still love this book.
3,"Better than Swordspoint, but..","The reviews for Swordspoint and The Fall of the Kings glow, but give the wrong idea. This is a very rich world, with a good plot and lots of tantalisingly familiar legends, academic argument, sensuality and magic, but the authors mentioned in the reviews: Georgette Heyer, Oscar Wilde, Jane Austen, Dickens.. probably wouldn't have come close to this. They would have set their work in a similar society; but that would have been all, and anyone hoping to see echoes of their work would have come away disappointed.The academic arguments were a bit too erudite for me, and I'd've enjoyed the story more if there had been less of that and more about Basil and his students, or the Tremontaines, or even about Arlen and Galing. My favourite character was Jessica, and she turned up only towards the end of the book. Hopefully she gets her own story later."
5,"intriguing, complicated and engrossing","What a lovely book, rich and layered, set in an alternate universe witout the usual cliches, it feels familiar and strange at the same time. I loved Swordspoint and Thomas the Rhymer, and this is a great successor. The people, heroes and anti-heroes alike, are treated sympathetically through the course of the book, and even the minor characters are intriguing and surprising. I'm not usually a fan of atmospheric novels, but this one worked beautifully. It also has enough plot and witty dialog and character development to keep me reading until *way* past my bedtime."
1,Bad Sequel to Swordspoint,"I bought this book because it is a sequel to Swordspoint, which I enjoyed very much. I got to about the third chapter of this book and because it seemed to me to be a very slow read I turned to the last part of the book to see if it gets any better. I read the ending and decided that reading the rest of the book would be a complete waste of my time. When I got the book I was really looking forward to reading it as I had such a good time reading Swordspoint. The characters all seemed to come alive for me in Swordspoint. In FotK the characters seemed very flat and not very interesting. I won't recommend this book to anyone."
1,What a huge disappointment!,"I've been waiting *years* for this? ""Swordspoint"" was stunning, beautiful, with characters who remain forever in the reader's imagination. I enjoy intrigue, drama and wonderfully written universe *but* if there aren't characters I can empathize with in the novel then it's a myopic read.There wasn't one, not *one* character with any redeaming qualities. In fact, the whole crew annoyed the hell out of me and I found myself speed reading in the hopes for a quick end. Every character was totally self-absorbed, apathetic, annoying, uninteresting.. what a disappointment. And that ending ... blech! Honestly, I tossed this dreadful novel in my library donation box. I'm sure there must be some people out there who will enjoy these types of non-characters. I didn't give a damn about them. Who would?"
3,"Holdstock, light.","Kushner & Sherman really do try very hard to achieve the mythopoetic feel that imbues the work of authors like Holdstock or McKillip. Unfortunately, they don't quite succeed. Their novel ends up being a less than seamless amalgamation of homoerotic 'victorianesque' romance and raw myth."
4,"good pack, but some parts missing","I was told the pack would have all the parts and they would all be in working order. That was not the case. My pack came with no shoulder straps and some of the snaps were broken. Its still a great pack and i plan on keeping it, but the issue with the parts kept it from getting that 5 star rating."
5,Great little throwback pack,"Great little pack for dirty work on the trails or to store emergency equipment. I can't review the quality of the pack you get, since that depends on the seller, but if you get a good quality one from a quality seller, it will go a long way."
1,IGNORE THE OTHER REVEIW !!!!!!! THIS IS COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC!!!,"This is not ""TINSTAR"" the industrial techno rock group! This is ""TIN STAR"" the country western band! I purchased this cd based on the other reveiw only to find out this guy has no ideal what he's talking about! He's obviously never actually heard this album! Hopfully he'll see this and remove his reveiw so others don't get suckered like me. You shouldn't rate material you haven't actually heard!!!!! If you like country western then buy this cd. BUT!!! If you like ""TINSTAR"" the EXCELLENT industial techno rock group, then look elsewhere!!!"
3,"Close, but no cigar","When it arrived in rather dubious packaging, I hoped it would live up to the expectations I had set, and ""Who is Bozo Texino"" does deliver in many satisfying ways. Sadly, however, it left me wanting so much more. The visceral images make promises that the narrative (for some mysterious reason) does not keep, but the film itself does leave an imporession. A ramshackle ""Style Wars"" set in a more primitive time. I had hoped to see a little more of the Hobo lifestyle that accompanies these lucid markings, and with Richard Linklater's help (or at least enough support to warrant a special thanks credit), I don't see why the film had to be cut so short. Please Mr. Daniel, give us more."
5,Ectoplasm over Illinois,"I like Cecy. I really do. She is young and beautiful and can turn amazing tricks. Like entering through the ear of any living being and looking out through its eyes. And all that without leaving her sandbox in the attic of the house. But Uncle Einar is quite something, too. With his gigantic wings he can fly around. But at times he gets hung up in a tree. For the Homecoming on Halloween, the whole Elliot tribe gathers. They come through squeaky doors, fly in through the windows, howl down the chimneys and even travel long distance on the Orient Express.Mr. Bradbury has written a ghost story of very special dimensions. Exquisite language with stunning imagination make for a book that will haunt you for some time to come."
3,Musings of a magical mind,"Ray Bradbury writes books that haunt you. It isn't just that they might (or might not) be ghost stories. They encourage you to see meaning in a drift of leaves, hear voices on the wind, imagine a life less prosaic. From the Dust Returned is all these things and more. If you're looking for a structured horror story, this is not the book for you. If you fancy a book you can dip into for days, evocative and amusing, that reminds you of the Addams Family on its better days, get this one."
2,Ouch,"I loveThe Homecoming (Wonderfully Illustrated Short Pieces), and when I stumbled upon From the Dust Returned at the library, I was delighted to take home a novel-length version of one of my favorite short stories to savor. Alas... Although the cover says ""A Novel,"" the pages say ""A cobbled-together collection of short stories that loosely go together... but not always.""There are noticeably distinct changes in writing style throughout the ""novel,"" and only couple of the stories share the dark, atmospheric writing that makes The Homecoming so incredible. This was a real disappointment. Also, while many novels of yesteryear were published as serials, they didn't take 50 years to come together. Age withered rather than mellowed this work.I don't think I would have had the same reaction if the cover had said ""An Anthology"" or ""A Collection"" rather than ""A Novel""... Maybe I would have, but it feels like bait & switch all the same."
3,The Master's Powers Waned,"I hate writing this. Ray Bradbury introduced me to magic, wonder, and sadness. I have read his brilliant works over and over throughout my life. I consider him one of the best American writers ever. This book, however, shows he was a little past his prime. He still had the chops, the vocabulary, the rhythms down, but the magic was only there in spots. I believe that he was reaching, overdoing the language just a little, knowing this would probably be his last book. Most other writers only pray to write this well, but for Bradbury it just wasn't the same as the early stories. October Country, The Small Assassin, The Foghorn, A Sound of Thunder, and on and on. I will continue going back into his work for the power and magic he channelled. I don't think I'll read this one again. Ray would understand why I'm so sad."
5,Twilight in the October country.,"Logic demanding reader beware! From the Dust Returned is a work by Bradbury the poet, NOT the short story writer. One of the greatest voices in 20th century writing as returned to, perhaps for the final time (though I sincerely hope not), that October Country filled to bursting with Dark Carnivals, Magic, and Wonder. Again and again his words carry us around the world, singing a bittersweet song that is part Dirge and part Ode to Joy for all things shadowy and creepy, sweet and spooky along the way. As the twilight fades to dawn, all things nightly battle to survive a world that believes it no longer needs them. But without shadow how can we truly love the light, and vice versa? Again and again Bradbury shows a unique mastery of the tone poem in this gathering of tales that only he could write. So gather around the jack o' lantern this Halloween and listen to one of America's literary greats whisper of delightfully spooky things. Listen."
3,More Poetry than Plot,"Bradbury's ""From the Dust Returned"" is a linguistic achievement. Line after line, his prose flows smoothly and seamlessly. He creates an eerie and exciting atmosphere which is itself almost a substitute for a general lack of plot. It is through innocent and adverturous characters and a strong use of language that Bradbury provides the reader with more of a masterful literary experience than entertainment.Despite Bradbury's charming, innocent characters and poetic prose, there is little at stake here and the novel is at times a connection of sketches and short stories. Although meaningful, the novel's ending is not very dramatic and ends suddenly."
3,I Wanted to Love it but I only Liked it,"I've been an admirer of Ray Bradbury since my grade six teacher read stories from the Illustrated Man to us back in the 1970's. I've read SOmething Wicked This Way Comes and Dandelion Wine a half dozen times each and I delve into his short stories all the time. When I discovered this book, a new Bradbury book about the Family, I had expectations so huge they could never be matched. Somehow the book never took hold. Maybe I'm too old, maybe his writing style has changed. To be sure the book has it's moments but as a whole it let me down. I wanted to love it so much I read it twice, but again that spark just wasn't there. It's still a good read just not the unforgettable master-piece I really wanted it to be. You just can't fake love no matter how much you wish it were different."
4,"Excellent Book, but disturbing end.",The book had a great storyline. Bradbury draws you into the characters. Bradbury takes you on a series of events that the family goes through. The only flaw in the book was the ending. Other than that the book was great.
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this set of short stories by Ray Bradbury. It was basically a re-write of the October Tree with two or three newer tales to tie up ""loose ends"" about this family. I was very disappointed by this book, especially after reading his newest - ""One for the Road""."
1,I Mourne The Trees That Died To Create This Book,"After reading a book I was so looking forward to, I feel violated as if Mr. Bradbury himself wanted to rip out my fondest memories of his brilliant tales and replace them with raw sewage. (See, I can write arty farty rubbish just like Ray did with this book!!) My sole comfort is that I purchased it on the secondary market so Mr. Bradbury procured no money from it. Shame on you, Ray!! What a waste of a Charles Addams art work!!"
1,[Return to Dust!],"Please don't waste your time with this nonense! It took me two months to finish a book that should hae taken about two hours. Very uninteresting, and the languge is hard to understand.Don't get me wrong Bradbury is a genius, and this his probable final work should be returned to the dust!!!"
4,Of Lauren's two albums this is my preference,"Bought this album before Lauren's ""Push the River"". ""Feels Like Family"" is still my choice. Really like her guitar work, her husky voice and the laid back feel of the album. Quite a few of my friends who are into blues also like the album, including a youngster who doesn't normally listen to blues. A pity some of the reviewers didn't stick to reviewing the music rather than how it is formatted etc. Worth a listen. Would like to see Lauren cut another album."
2,disappointed,The samples sounded promising but the full songs were pedestrian blues with no guts. 2 songs were worth saving.
4,Good book,I got this book for a class I am taking. It is a very easy to understand book. Would recommend it to anyone who is trying to make sense of the Nicene Creed.
2,Not great.,"Hanson has some wacked out ideas and presents most of the book from his perspective. Don't use this as a textbook. It is layout poorly and he presents a very biased view on theology. Instead, read ""Theology Brewed in an African Pot"" for a clearer (and culturally-interesting) dive into what theology really is."
5,Not your old boring children's songs,"I got this CD for my daughter's 1st birthday. It is great !!!she dances to it, I dance to it, and the songs stay in my head all day. Very good music. I will buy it for my pregnant sister."
5,A surprisingly great children's CD that adults will love too,"I can't stop singing these songs! This was a gift from a friend, and the music is terrific, not to mention I love the artist themes woven into good music. ""Stay Three"" is poignant for any parent, yearning for their child to remain as adorable as they are at this moment. I am off to buy some more Jessica Harper!"
4,One Nice Algebra Textbook,"The UCSMP Advanced Algebra, which I used during my 3-week preparation for the challenge test, is one nice algebra textbook. This is the same text that we use for Algebra II/Course III in our school, and although many people say that it's mostly a review of Algebra I (including my friend Lynn Zhang), I think this book still gives enough new ideas to anyone who has some good algebra skills but is not yet ready for the rigor of precalculus mathematics. This textbook helped me restore my lost confidence and interest in mathematics, and therefore I rate this book with 4 stars."
4,Easy to Read and Informative,"Though this book skips some traditional cuisines and does not delve into nutritional information on foods, it is a good read nevertheless. Admittedly, Ms. Tannahill is taking on a HUGE job so I'll forgive her for her shortcomings and praise her for what she does include.I'd supplement this book with Oxford's Companion to Food and/or Cambridge World History of Food for a more thorough historical approach to food. See Nourishing Traditions for info on traditional food preparation techniques."
4,the connection between society and food through the ages,The book shows how man has learned to use food to his advantage. It gives menues from roman times as well as how man hunted and gathered . It also goes into every aspect of cooking and food storage during the middle ages and later. I would rrecoment this book for any person interested in food.
3,"How we got from killing with our bare hands, to using a fork and knife","Ever wonder how someone thought of cooking food, rather than communally ripping it apart? The book describes the evolution of food prepartation and eating; noting some of the typical diets throughout the ages; the Romans, the middle ages, and up to the present time."
2,Put me to sleep,"This book had me bored from the first sentence. I guess it just wasn't what I was looking for in a book about food..I wanted something a bit more exciting, because frankly food gets me excited! I think I will stick to Anthony Bourdain's books from now on."
4,eye opener,"well,i believe that the author has done good research and has given a breath of life to a subject that most wouldn't even stop to give a second thought about.. especially the origins of the food that we now consume... the author garnishes the book with enlightening scientific, cutural and religious points of view on the various aspects and perception towards certain types of food or meals...."
2,Fair,Not my best book choice. I read the book and it was ok. I did not even look at other books by this author.
2,"Great Collector's Piece, but...","It is not much help in teaching your kids grammar -- not even with the answer keys. I love old grammar books, but this one was meant for teachers who had other supplemental material to go with it. There is not any review at all. Great for nostalgia, near-worthless for teaching."
5,Don't buy this expecting 5 star matches,Like the title says don't buy this expecting none stop 5 star matches. But if you enjoy a good fun night of wrestling buy this DVD.
1,The item dimensions were not correct,"We wanted to install the curtain in front of the blind and we needed a tall bracket, that's why I bought this item. but when I received it, I was shocked. It was much smaller than the dimensions mentioned in the ""Product Detail"".We sent it back 3 weeks ago, and waiting for the refund!"
3,Good if your in range of the transmitter,"I have had these head phones for probably 3 years and have used them quite often, primarily for listening to TV.The head phone sound great and are easy to operate, the range I think is quite reasonable.I don't understand why anyone would design a head phone that has such an incredibly obnoxious horrible beeping noise if you lose the signal to the head phones. Isn't losing the sound a good enough indication that you lost the signal? I think this is a huge down side of these head phones.I use them often when I am outside working and love to listen (that is if there is a good signal all the time), although they are heavy and they are HOT. I can't wear them for very long otherwise they are just too hot to wear. Even sitting in front of the TV for any length of time doing nothing they get hot.They do block out a good part of back ground noise, but the down side is they are hot"
4,Sorry to see it go.,"I was looking for just the headset, HDR140, but apparently this unit has been discontinued, so I took what I could find. I have a hearing problem, so the Dynamic Compression is a real benefit. It helps with picking dialogue out of the background noise. This model seems to be the only one that has that feature, and now it's gone."
4,Sennheiser RS 140 headphones,Refurbished item as good as new. Very fast shipping. Very pleased with this vendor and the purchase.
5,Sennheiser RS 140 Wireless Headphones,"Easy installation. Excellent sound quality. Performs as advertised. Needed to contact Sennheiser, customer service with a technical question. Did not have a long waiting period before being connected to an adviser. The adviser was friendly and my question was answered immediatly. Should be noted that I had no problem understanding what the adviser was saying. The customer service facility is here in the USA."
4,"Pretty good, though range leaves something to be desired","When the headphones are in range of the base without obstruction, they sound great with just a little tweaking of my sound system. However, maybe it's just my apartment, but after leaving the room where the base is, the sound can start going in and out while less than 20 feet away. It is an old place and there is probably lots of interference, but I expected a little more range. For what I use it for most, though, which is watching movies and playing games LOUD, the sound is phenomenal."
5,Best for TV,"I've worn out one IR headset and three RF headsets since 1988 and these are the best by far for watching television. I can't address the issue of hiss mentioned by some reviewers because my high-frequency hearing is impaired, and I don't listen to very much music, but for hearing dialogue on television dramas, the RS 140 can't be beat. The headset is comfortable, the cups cancel most external noise, and the controls are easy to use. I had given up watching most tv dramas because I could not understand the dialogue over the soundtrack. No more! I now understand every word! My wife, whose acute hearing tests way above average, even asked me to translate some dialogue from CSI Miami! I gave her my headset and had to plead to get it back! Now I'm trying to find an extra headset. I had no difficulty setting up the transmitter and I found the controls easy to understand and use. The only negative comment I can offer is that the Engish translation of the German manual could be better."
2,"Decent, but RS 120's are better for the price. Background low frequencies more pronounced.",I have the RS 120 set for home and wanted to get something for work that would isolate more noise. I couldn't find a good set of wireless noise canceling headphones so I decided to try these. They were able to remove the high frequency noises but the low frequencies (people's voices) were more pronounced than without the headphones. It was very annoying so I sent them back and have been using my RS 120 set at work instead. The RS 120's don't drown out the background noise as much but it is much more tolerable than having random low frequency noises.I didn't notice a difference in performance between the two so for the price the RS 120 set is a better buy and I actually prefer them as well.
2,Hiss and pop,"These wireless headphones are easy to set up and fit comfortably. Thats the good news.The bad news is you get to enjoy the ever present company of hiss and pop. Whether you are right in front of the device or ten feet away. I think the only way you could get these to work without the hiss sounds would be returning them and getting normal headphones with longer wires.If wireless is the most important function in your opinion, then your sound quality will suffer, they just dont make good enough technology yet.I will be returning mine."
5,Senn-sational,"Excellent sound quality, and very little distortion. It's well worth the money... Comfy fit, and has an extremely large wireless range. GREAT PRODUCT!!!"
3,Not great but not bad,"I bought these for home and since I've got way too many cords already, I thought it would be good to go wireless but I didn't have my hopes up considering audiophile buddies have told me that wireless tech just isn't there yet. I wasn't expecting them to perform as well as my Audio Technica ATH-Pro 700s (slightly cheaper and wired closed cup DJ headphones that I use at work) but I had my hopes up and sadly these don't even come close. The sound is flat and lifeless compared to what I'm used to, even compared to the rather cheap CX-300s that I use with my iPod. Add to that a slight hiss and the placement of the balance button - every time I've taken them off I invariably jerk it to one ear - and you have a 3. Not bad since the convenience of wireless is okay but don't buy these if you want them for bringing out the best in your music - they are wireless and that's what you are paying for. I'm keeping them since they are just for gaming without annoying the GF."
1,Flawed!,This is my second pair that only emit sound from one headphone. The instruction book only has a couple of pages listed in English and NO customer service number.
1,Sennheiser RS 140,"Great idea,but they would not work on any of our TV's. I sent them back and am still waiting for my refund."
3,Sound not as good as wired HD 280,"It may not be fair for me to say, but I was filled with angst that my Sennheiser HD 280s sounded better than my $5,000 Dali Speakers but had no such feelings about the RS 140s which sounded good, almost equal, to my speakers but not in the same league by my ears as the wired HD 280s. Maybe it is an unwired thing or maybe the HD 280s were amped up a bit more in the midrange which I like. For what they are, maybe a 4 star overall for the RS 140s, but for the sound quality I wanted, only a 3 star. Also, the leadset for the RS 140 seemed slightly loose to me. Those that complained about the sealed HD 280 being too tight were exagerating in my opinion. However, what was to keep then from storing the headset on something slightly larger than their head for a night or two to make them more comfortable? On a side note, the open HD 555 is supposed to have slightly better sound than the HD 280 (hard to imagine) but I haven't heard them yet."
3,Sennheiser RS140 review,"I am pleased with these wireless headsets although I am still tring to get completely comfortable with them. I have had terrible experiences with Amazon and would be reluctant to use them again. Somehow I got in the middle of a dispute between one of their vendors and Amazon. The vendor refused to ship the item because of a alleged pricing error and Amazon refuses to give a prompt credit. Purchase was more that $1,500 so beware of dealing with Amazon. Anyone who wants the details should contact me."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I have used Sennheiser headphones for years. I read a review on these RS140 that suggested that for folks with hearing imbalance these were really good because they have a balance control. So that is the primary reason I bought this model. The first problem I had was that if you do not place the headphones exactly right on the stand, they do not charge. It always takes several attempts to get it right, and I often have to place another object up against the phones to hold them in just the right place. At first I had terrible distortion, and was about to give up on them, when I accidentally discovered that if I lowered the volume of the receiver they were connected to, that I could get decent sound. This did not occur to me sooner, because the volume had been set at the same levels for my previous set of Sennheiser phones. It took a lot of fiddling to get these to work the way something this expensive should, but once I have all the quirks figured out, I'm pleased with them."
4,Very good headphones,"I recently bought the Sennheiser RS 140 Wireless headphones, and the sound is excellent, the only small problem is when I walk around the house, I will hear faint static, or sometimes, the sound drops out for a second. I am glad it has volume and balance on the headphones. I am still quite happy with my purchase"
2,OK for TV but NOT for live music,"If you are a live music fan you do not want these. While these were OK for TV (only gave them a breif trail on TV) They were not very good for listening to live music. There is a constant hiss/hum which becomes glaringly obvious between songs and can be heard during softer parts of the music. I use this at my desk so the headphones and base station are less than 4 feet from each other. I tried all three channels and tuning settings multiple times and I could not find one acceptable for me. Additionally, even on the best 2 channels I found I would occasionally hear lound distortions in the sound when I turned my head or chair; and these becoame painfully more frequent if I moved as far as 10-12 feet from the base station. Maybe my expectations where too high."
1,HORRIBLE,"Shame on you, Sennheiser!!! If I wanted to listen to hiss/static, I would have paid $20 at Walmart. These headphones are unusable for podcasts, digital piano, lectures, and almost anything other than loud music. In addition to the baseline static, the reception on these headphones is poor. If you want to use these things for anything other than a paperweight, be prepared to assume a catatonic posture. Don't even hope to hear anything other than in and out static while exercising. I read many reviews of this product before purchasing. What a disappointment! I also love the NO RETURNS policy for headphones. It makes me wonder if the people writing these reviews are field representatives for Sennheiser (or on drugs). I have other Sennheiser products (corded headphones and noise-cancelling microphones) which are pricey, but excellent quality. Caveat emptor!!!"
5,Great for the hearing impaired,"I purchased these headphones for my father, and he loves them. He has impaired hearing in one ear and the balance control allows him to adjust the levels accordingly. His old headphones did not have this feature, and I was concerned about possible hearing damage to his good ear. Now we can all watch television together with the volume at a level that is comfortable for everyone. However, do keep in mind that these headphones are very effective at blocking out external noises, and it may take a bit of effort to gain the user's attention."
3,NO distance on pickup. Good for inside house.,"Use my headphones for outside in the yard. Mostly XM radio, some CD's and even records. Not good outside next to the house, sixty feet from receiver it goes into beeping mode and blips in and out. VERY disappointed. I am using them now inside house, XM radio, sound good no complaints inside house. IF you are looking for distance in yard, think again."
5,Wireless freedom and great sound!,I bought these for my wife because of the neighbor's dog's barking. We were surprised how easy these head phones were to set up and how clear the tv and music sounded everywhere in the house and outside.
4,sennheiser wireless headphones,"I have owned these for about a month or so. My wife is thrilled that I watch sports while she has relative peace and quiet...despite the sport editorials I emit. I really like these headphones. I am impressed with the quality of sound, the finger controls on the headset, the long charge held by the headphones, and overall ease of use. The only reservation is the buzz I hear in certain positions despite being at 10 feet distance, mostly between audio feeds...but also sometimes during the feed. So I have moved the base around, since I have electronics nearby...I am still doing the trial and error. Overall, very happy with this device."
4,Recommend Sennheiser RS140 Wireless Headphones for TV Viewing,"The RS140 headphones are top of the line phones. They are well constructed and provide good sound. But they are wireless, so expect some background hiss occassionally. They are easy to setup and use, and the recharging arrangement is very convenient. Although somewhat pricey, these are nice phones for TV viewing."
3,mixed results,"Fidelity is reasonably good, but I get an occasional chirping sound if I move around the room or lean my head against certain objects. The headphones are comfortable and minimize sound leakage for others in the room."
4,Nice sound,The headphones are as good as my Bose for sound and work great. I would have given them a 5 except for the weight of the head set. Eazy to set up and great quality so far.
5,Sennheiser RS 140 Wireless Balanced Headphones,Great product! I bought these for my wife to replace an older pair. These are clear and she can walk from one room in the house with out losing reception.
4,Excellent Product But,"Product has so far performed as expected except that with my head against a pillow, the controls can be moved unintentionally."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,"I've been using mine almost daily from a laptop for 2 years, they work great. I'm still using the original batteries and they hold a charge just fine. There is occasional static if I walk around the house, but I have tons of electronics and I'm sure it's other interference that probably any wireless headset would suffer from. I have found that some music does not sound so great with Windows Media Player (this is a software problem, not the headphones), I have had superb results with Winamp because the equalizer is so adjustable/tunable. So, these headphones combined with Winamp sound GREAT! I was reserved about getting these because of the price....but you know, music is such a big part of life, enjoy it to the MAX!"
2,Not what I expected,"There is simply too much background noise when there isn't any music playing, and even when there is music on, I could still hear the buzzing noise. If this is true of all wireless models, then I would rather stick to wired headphones."
4,Pretty darn good.,They work as they are supposed to. There is a little FM style hiss but they are perfect for doing household chores and shoveling snow.
4,Just died in the third year but was great while it lasted,"I don't know what went wrong - they were working fine this morning and tonight the volume simply wouldn't rise about the lowest setting. I've played with everything I could, but they seem dead. Just plunked down a big chunk of change for the latest and greatest version which I really couldn't afford right now, but I can't live without the headphones! That's how good they are. I bought these to replace a Panasonic set from a few years back, and have mostly been happy with them. The range could be better, and the signal strength fades in and out upstairs, but it hasn't been a huge problem. I use them to listen to satellite radio as I wander around the house doing chores or when I'm lying in bed. Sometimes out on the patio when I'm working the grill or reading a book. They were great for this purpose, and while not noise cancelling, still acceptable.Wish they were still under warranty."
2,Radio is pretty lame,"There's not much point in having really nice headphones if the wireless is second rate. These headphones have three channels to choose from, but -- at least in my neighborhood -- all of them have the kind of noise that reminds me of a radio set that looks like furniture. Wood. Knobs. The family hunched around the speaker to try to discern the signal from the noise.The signal breaks up, noise fades in and out. Reading other reviews I anticipated a less-than-audiophile experience, but in retrospect I think I'd rather have shelled out 30 bucks for a low end headphone because that's all I got anyway. In fact, any $5 headphone on a wire would be better than these.I give it two stars instead of one because they look cool, are easy to set up, and in the rare moments of strong signal, they sound just fine. I wonder what radio frequencies they are on and what they're competing with around here."
5,Old codger likes these phones,"I Have a hearing problem - one ear worse. Have, over the years, had several wireless headphones. These are THE BEST!!. The volume can be adjusted from a whisper to loud; each side is adjustable for volume; the frequency can be changed with no effort, AND THE RANGE IS AWESOME!!! Best of all, tech support is excellent.Dave"
2,Snap Crackle Pop - Rice Crispies!,"I was so excited about these headphones, especially after I read the reviews posted here. Unfortunately, these babies pop and hiss non-stop, completely ruining my audio experience. I'll admit that I am using them in an office setting, so perhaps there is a lot of interference from wireless mice and PDAs and such. But don't we live in a digital world by now? My cell phone doesn't hiss like this, and it's talking to a tower a mile away, not to a receiver on my desk.Not all bad:1. The charging stand is well designed, and the battery life is long.2. They feel really comfortable, never touching my ears.3. The on/off switch and volume on the headphones come in handyOne more bad thing:If the headphones don't receive any audio signal for a minute, they power down. Sounds good, but you are alerted to this fact by a series of grating loud beeps. At least the hissing goes away too."
2,Great when they worked,They caome with a two year warranty. I purchased mine in Jan 2010 they quit working in May of 2012. and sennheiser does not make out of warranty repairs. so why the h... should i buy them again
3,Easy to use but unacceptable interference levels for the price,"I received the Sennheiser RS 140 headphones yesterday, and am sending them back tomorrow. My intended use was for watching movies and TV, especially late at night. Set up was cake, the product is well built, and the cradle and charging system works well.However, these phones fall over where it counts, the sound quality. There is simply way too much interference for a product at this price level, and it is extremely distracting during dialog in movies or TV shows. May be fine if you just want to use it for music, as the sound quality itself is fairly good, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Sennheiser RS 140 Wireless Headphone,Great product! My husband can now enjoy watching TV. He always had the volume turned up and it was to much for other people to enjoy. Now we can have it at the volume we enjoy and he can hear it just great thru the headphones. Would highly recommend this product.
4,Great for listening to the TV AND Stereo,"I bought these at the same time I bought ""TV Ears"" because I'm hard of hearing and my wife complains about the TV being too loud when I watch it.The TV ears are okay for listening with my wife in the room; however, when the dog sits between me and the TV or I raise my knees I get static.This problem doesn't exist with the Sennheiser RS 140 Wireless Balanced Headphones because they use radio waves to transmit the sound.The added benefit is that I can actually listen to the stereo from the living room while I'm in my office with perfect sound.The clarity and quality of sound is outstanding.The only disadvantage (if you want to call it that) is that it's harder to hear someone talking to you while you're wearing them because the cups fit snuggly around your ears."
4,"Good range, but some static","I've been using these headphones for about a month. The controls on the ear cups are convenient, but my ears tend to sweat after about 40 minutes. Sound quality is really good, except for some static noise when the headset is at certain angles to the transmitter. It works through walls/around corners, and has a decent range (at least 20 feet)."
4,Solid,"I bought these because we just had a baby and I wanted to watch tv without disturbing him. It sounds pretty good, but as I only listen to tv on it, I can't comment on music. I have noticed a bit of distortion with voices - not all the time, but it's definitely not crystal clear. There is also a decent amount of hiss and pop if you walk around the house as the RF tries to get a clean signal (I'm assuming.)In response to the audio controls being on the back of the headphones - they don't really bother me at all and I sit on the couch on a pillow most of the time. The reason is, the switches all have a default position that you have to push a bit to get off, so it's not like a slight press will move them.They are a bit large for my tiny head, but they still work fine (i just look like an air traffic controller.) Overall I'm satisfied. I was hoping for maybe a bit more pristine sound since they cost so much, but they've worked out fine."
5,Great headphones,"The quality of construction and sound is great! Very easy to get set up and easy to use. Many automated settings features which work quite well. These block out room sounds quite well and provide very good quality sound for music or voices on TV. I have them hooked to my MythTV (DVR) which handles my TV, movie, and music collection making it easy for me or my wife to watch TV or listen to music without disturbing the other but still getting full enjoyment from entertainment system. My wife likes being able to do house work, wandering all over the house, and listen to programs. You just set the headphones on the base and they are recharging through the contacts on the headband. Want a good wireless headset? This is it."
4,They work great!,There are certain DVD's I watch via computer. This allows me to watch and not hear my husband talking on the phone. Wonderful!
4,Great product.,"These headphones are exactly what I needed. They exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort and quality. The only problem is that if you are in a warm room, the headphones will start to get hot on you after a while and your ears will start to sweat. This is the only problem. Can't really comment on the quality of the transmitting range, as in I use the headphones in a tiny apartment. I use these headphones mainly for internet broadcasts and internet radio. They come in handy in avoiding disturbing my neighbors at odd hours. Also, I use them for multitasking. Used to have to mute my equipment before going in to brush my teeth. Ever the busy one; now I can continue to listen while doing such things around my apartment. These wireless headphones are a good buy."
1,Nice idea but more or less DOA,"Easy to set up. Despite charging for over a day upon arrival, the batteries would not work for more than 5 minutes at a time. Tuning sucks, constant interference if you move around at all. The fit is not good, too tight, hard to wear without cranial pain. Would expect a lot more from Sennheiser at this price range. Better fit, easy to replace rechargeable AA batteries, etc. Don't waste your money!"
2,Not worth the money,"Way to expensive to have the sound quality of a dollar store headphone. Worthwhile to use while watching TV, but there are less expensive headphones on the market for that. Returned mine."
2,The Jag X of the high end audio world,"Sennheiser has been the gold standard, but now it seems that they are no more then a name for a secondary OEM. Like Ford/Jag; the jag is no better then most cars that are 10-15K less yet their name keeps them going. Same for these headphones. Such a shame!"
2,good but.,These are good headphones when I can hear through them. I bought them to connect to my television so I could watch at night without disturbing my wife while she sleeps. Surprize...these things get no signal coming through them if the volume on the tv set is turned way down or muted. What is the purpose of head phones if they are dependant on having the volume turned up at the source?
1,"over rated, over priced","I've owned 4 sets of these Sennheiser wireless phones. Not only over priced, they are not compatible with most audio equipment in the sense that they have their own volume control which only works when the input volume is cranked to a disturbing level. These are represented as personal listening devices but when everyone within a 900 foot radius of the input device must tolerate the sound, I'd call these a complete FLOP. IF you seek wireless personal listening device, please locate a seller of TV Ears. They cost less and work flawlessly. Some ENT physicians actually sell them."
4,Quality Headphones...,"I bought these for my mom in law, who has difficulty hearing. She now enjoys watching the TV without disturbing by having the volume too high..It's great quality and sound is very good too. Sometimes there may be small interferences but these go away as soon as they appear.Will highly recommend for folks who need to listen to TV or music without troubling others."
2,Durable and good sound with one significant flaw,"I've been using a set of HDR140s for nearly three years, mostly during workouts and gaming. Great sound. Durable headset if you treat it well. The problem is with the placement of the volume wheel on the back of the right earpiece. If you want to lean back on a couch or pillow and have the volume stay where it is--forget it. It will either turn down, or it will try to blow your eardrums out. This is a major design flaw, so I cannot recommend this headset for anything but upright activities where you are not leaning your head back against anything."
2,Cuts out; poor transmission over distance,"Well that was disappointing. We got an earlier Sennheiser headset that worked very well and could be used quite a distance from the house. This model cuts out, even inside the house, and doesn't cover near the distance the older one does. We plugged it directly into the satellite sending unit, and the signal still isn't strong enough to deliver consistent sound. It also interferes a lot more with the cordless phone. I'm going to buy a separate headset for the old system (didn't know you could do that before) for use outdoors.The pros are that the headset is very comfortable, the sound excellent, and the buttons very usable."
3,"Great sound, when it doesn't drop out","The RS 140 phones are well made and the sound quality is excellent (really a surprise for a wireless set). The closed design keeps out ambient sound so effeciently that I am often unaware of things that I shouldn't be unaware of. But the big disappointment is reception. I live in a small apartment in a large building and use the phones with a high quality TV. It doesn't take much moving around to have the sound dropping out. I've experimented with channel settings and moving the transmitter, but nothing makes any difference. I am torn between keeping the phones for their fine sound and resistance to ambient noise, and returning them because I can't walk 15 feet into the kitchen without lots of dropouts. I used Sony wireless phones before these: they had far superior reception and much inferior sound."
2,Not Sennheiser quality,"Pros: Well built, easy to use, simple. The sound, if it comes through, is well balanced and gives a nice, roomy reproduction, detailed trebles, punchy or warm bass as needed.Cons: Surprisingly high level of noise, uniform regardless of distance (i.e., within the room or next room). Base station changes volume when spectrum widens/contracts (e.g., bass heavy to wide) have to adjust on headset manually. Reception sometimes unreliable even a few feet away at various angles.Overall: Could be nice headphones, but I expect no such cons from Sennheiser.I would not buy it again."
1,Really bad reception,"I was really disappointed by the performance of these headphones. The amount of static it transmits is unbelievable. Even when I'm just two feet away from the transmitter, I can hear noise and it doesn't even stay constant, it fluctuates which makes it impossible for you to mentally ""tune out"" the noise.Perhaps it's because of all the electronic noise and appliances in my area, but that's no excuse for bad reception at a distance of 2 feet. I wasn't expecting audiophile quality sound, but for $150 I definitely at least expect clear transmission within a six feet radius!Also, whoever thought of putting the controls on the rear was obviously no genius. It's impossible to lie down while wearing these headphones without messing up the volume and balance.Bottomline - Not worth the money - good features, bad implementation. Horrible reception unless you live in an extremely uncongested area!"
3,Not as good as advertised,"I have tried 5 different brands of wireless headphones. Primarily I use them when outside doing yard work and need a range of 150 feet or more. Although the range on these headphones was slightly better than some other brands, they still did not provide a clear signal up to 150 feet. The clarity was not any better than other brands costing half as much. The headphones are well constructed, probably better than they need to be. Overall this is a quality product, but certainly not worth the cost. Much less expensive wireless expensive headphones manufactured by Sony and RCA provide just as good of performance."
4,FINALLY FOUND THE ANSWER,"In November I purchased a Set of Wireless Sennheiser RS140 Headphones.I have severe hearing loss, and even with hearing aids I still could never make out the dialogue on any TV show or movie. I had an earlier set but, of course. they were cheaper and not even near the quality of these earphones. When I turn them on I can almost hear a whisper, and my wife is very happy about this because I was driving her crazy. The only problem I've had with them is that the earphones never want to seat properly on the cradle for charging. I have to keep adjusting them to finally get the charge light on. Otherwise, well worth the money."
3,Short Range,"The headphones work fine except the range is quite low. They work poorly at 50 feet versus the 330 feet stated on the box, though in my use there are a few plaster walls in between."
1,Very disappointing,"Most reviews of wireless headphones I've read say that a little ""fuzz"" is in every brand. This set seemed the most promising, but it was extremely disappointing. The main reason for purchasing this set was to be able to work in my kitchen and office, each one room away from the source. I had to turn my head and/or switch channels constantly in an attempt to get good reception. When I got a clear signal, the sound was good, but even then it wasn't $130+ worth of good."
3,not 150 meters range,"I got my headphones 10 days ago, but they didn't pass the test, specifically going outdoors and working in the yard while listening to the ballgame.I had line of sight between the transmitter and the headphones, but I couldn't do more than 60 ft before the signal got choppy, and if I put my head under the car hood, or went around a house corner, I had more blank time than ballgame time.The vendor says I have to pay $18 shipping and $27 restocking fee. I'm protesting!!!!!!!!!Dennis, in Marysville WA"
4,Sennheiser RS 140 Wireless Balanced Headphones,Solid piece of equipment. Supplied with several plug connectors giving excellent compatibility with wide variety of outputs.
2,Over priced and not much better,"Sad to say these aren't much better than a $40 set.I bought this for my dad because the $39 set he had for 7 years was falling apart so I bought this more expensive set and was really very disappointed the original $39 set from 7 years ago sounded better when they were first bought than this set.Do your selves a favor and save a lot of money, buy a cheaper set."
1,My earphone review,The Sennheiser Earphones were well packed but that was all. The instructions were meager and non-helpful. The item when assembled did not show any sign of charging and operating. I was patient and checked everything many times as I really needed this equipment to amplify my hearing. I tried to reach the Sennheiser Company on the web but was unable. I finally gave up and returned the headphones to Amazon. Joseph Tibbets
1,More Noise Than Music,"I bought these wireless headphones because they had a five star rating at the time of my purchase. Little did I know that there were only three reviews that took up the whole first page.These headphones do not work. I can stand right next to the base which transmits signal, and it will alternate between pure static and noisy music. Even when you get signal, it's like bad radio reception.Readers please note that there are many different ""reconditioned"" models from the same manufacturer for sale on Amazon, and they are all likely returns for the very same reason I detailed here.Beware!"
3,Hmmmm,"Raven has a different feel than the first three since she still has her mom, even though she doesn't know who her dad is. Her mom lands in jail so it's off to live with Uncle. Since this is a mini-story, lots of details that could have been explored - the implication that Uncle had dome something maybe naughty with Mom - were briefly mentioned and then never explored. This series had the potential to have a full and more fleshed out story for each girl, it's too bad that Neiderman decided to cut short and make a mini-series instead of another superb series like the Cutler series."
3,MUCH better,"This book was much, much, MUCH better than the first three in the series! Sadly, that's not saying much. Raven's story is different from the other girls', however, and not quite as predictable. I really liked Raven's character. She is bold, smart, and not afraid to speak her mind!I would have loved to see this book made into a full-length novel, without the ugly cover! I am tired of these teenybopper ""mini-books"" V.C. keeps writing, but if you have to read one, pick this one."
4,Raven,"What would your life be like if your mother was a drug addict? Raven and her mother lived in a run-down apartment until she got into more trouble then she could handle. Raven had no stable family life however she managed to be a great person who was strong willed and able to stand up for herself. She had good morals, and wonderful values despite what her mother may have done. Raven was put in her uncle Reuben's custody but before too long she was taken away. Read the book to find out why.VC Andrews wrote many books, and many series. One series that she wrote was about orphans. This series had many other books such as Butterfly, Crystal, Brooke, and Raven the book I read. I have never read any of the other books but it they're as good as this book I will. The way VC Andrews used figurative language was terrific. If you ever get a chance to read any of these books, do because they're written wonderfully."
1,"A little darker, but still immature","Okay, this one was a little bit darker, but still I felt like I was being talked down to. If I were a teenager I would feel offended that the author feels they need to alter their writing style to make me interested in reading. Ick."
1,Totally and utterly disappointing,"This book left me wondering what the point of the collective 4 books was.I found this character to be weak.Her pathetic attempts to defend herself against her uncle goes against every bit of character that the author obviously spent so much time trying to build. These 4 books total lack of direction have left me with no desire to read Runaways when it comes out. I wouldn't waste my money or time!! As a personal note to the ghost writer for Miss Andrews, IT IS TIME TO PUT YOUR PEN DOWN!!! YOU STINK! You have gotten SO far away from Miss Andrews original style and imagination, that you may as well write the books under your own name and get the lousy reviews yourself, instead of staining the memory of a very good author."
2,Public officials will take comfort,This is a book for your local government official and your state school teacher to take comfort from.Its reasonably well put together but fails to really tackle the principals of government - which is basically to make you do things you dont want to by force (otherwise it would have no reason to exist) and to do so in the name of 'public good' which usually only means the good of some politically favored people at the expense of others.Usually to the benefit of the governers themselves.Suffice to say I wasn't converted into the state's obedient lap-dog.
3,A Necessary Evil,"The best aspect of this book is the reason it had to be written - mainly, to counteract the insistent rhetoric of the Far Right and the tacit approval of those in this country who label themselves as Conservative. The notion that our government is an evil entity out to restrict our rights and freedoms is, of course, nothing more than legendary bunk, yet it's amazing how many people mouth such beliefs without any real substantiation. Wills basically addresses this issue by providing a bookful of facts and history about all aspects of our nations growth and development. It will never convince die-hard militia members, but reasonable and patriotic people will find this 'truth' to be a breath of fresh air."
2,pro new world/anti american experience,"its clear wills is using current political correctness and his own acadamic-elitist beliefs to rewrite our history. by starting off with a total trashing of the second and attempting to prove that because guns were not in wills shows a total lack of unbias belief. (just what were people using to shoot dinner with then?) his assertation that the 2nd is unfounded because it allows uprising against the govt also is untrue. he quickly and easily will exchange the word government for constitution, completely ignoring the fact that the bill of rights is not about protecting a govt, but an ideal. he also never fully explains that the bill of rights was written and ratified in 1791...long after we had established ourselves as a country. a neccesary evil? maybe. a neccesary run-amok one? hardly."
1,This book is booring and poorly written,"This book is badly done propaganda, an obvious attempt to cash in on the antigun hyteria so common in media today. It is a tedious waste of time no matter what your opinion on the subject."
1,"Read between the lines, just another pawn of the socialists.","This book is just another attempt by the socialist left to break the American spirit of individualism. THAT is what made this country great. This author is just following an agenda of their own for a socialist, totalitarian America. The more people who are dependent on government, the more power they have, the less TRUE freedom we all have. The ultimate goal: socialism. I personally DO NOT want to have to beg the government to give me my money back that they ""appropriated"" through taxes. Don't be fooled; ultimate power ultimately corrupts. Distrust of the government is good. Contrary to what ""revisionist historians"" like Mr. Wills may say. God Bless a Free America."
2,A muddled book on an important topic,"The book has some decent historical merit, but by coming down far on the pro-government side he ignores and misreads several key issues and people. Not helping his case against the militia/pro-gun argument is his citing of the discredited Michael Bellesilles, once thought of as the savior of the left and now accused of fabricating evidence. Additionally, the chapter 'A Necessary Good' is disastrous. The man conflates the existence of a division of labor (economic, not political) and of social norms and restrictions(social, not political) with the *necessity* and benficience of the state! By not proving that these can and would exist without a powerful state, he traps himself into a terribly fallacious argument. It reveals so much of the intellectual poverty of those who seek to glorify an organization whose roots and claims to legitimacy stem solely from force."
3,Wills comsistently ignores or disregards the radical Left's,"Author Wills uses only 'rightwinger' attitudes and fails to equally enumerate and illustrate the radical Left's anti-government, anti-America philosophies, statements and programs. His sins-of-omission are curious to this reader and probably illuminary to rightwingers about Wills' own sentiments and orientations."
2,Too Absolute,"Though I believe the author offers points in which to ponder about soul progression and the afterlife, I hardly believe that she's entirely got the plan figured out. When one trudges through the chapters, it's as if she's actually interviewed God - too absolute in thinking. It would have been more enlightening if she would have presented her experiences and views as a perspective, not the law. Additionally, I believe she threw in too many client experiences that had no merit, except to show how helpful she's been to others. Mediocre read...buy it only if you find it at a garage sale."
5,A Must Read,"To really believe that ""everything happens for a reason"" even though we may not understand what the reasons are at this moment, tomorrow, or even at a later time is a concept to me that is truly mind-boggling. Knowing that everything has a purpose can make you stop and reflect on why situations happen, become aware of unresolved issues, and look at life differently. If you are searching for an understanding of why life on earth is often painful and unfair, or just a reason of what our purpose is in life----this book is a must read."
5,"Excellent, down-to-earth, description of mediumship","This book is sensitively written and presents a clear description of mediumship. I recommend it for those who are interested in the psychic realm and wish to learn more about how spirit actually communicates with the living. I also recommend it for those who are grieving the loss of a loved one, and are seeking comfort. In a down-to-earth, sensitive style, Suzane Northrop offers a view of the spirit world, and describes spirit communication from the medium's point of view. Through personal accounts of her many clients' experiences, the reader gains hope and comfort. Through reading this book, the reader will understand that everything DOES happen for a reason, and there is more to life than meets the eye. A definite must-read for anyone seriously pondering the supernatural."
2,"Should be titled ""Another book on The Other Side""","The title of this book was very catchy and something I thought would be comforting in a time when things went horrible for me. I'd say about 70-80% of this book is about seances and ""DP"" (Dead People). I do admit I like 20% of the book only b/c that's what the book should've focused on...the fact that things do happen for a reason, only I wished the author emphasized on that more than she did. Sometimes Northrop kinda makes it seem like life is a destiny and at other times, life is but a free will. It's confusing. But overall, what she probably meant to say was our free will was how we determine our fate/destiny."
3,"Music fine, interviews....bleh","The music is well done, his voice better than I expected for this kind of music. The thing that I didn't like was the way each musician was paraded in front of the camera to say how wonderful Paul is...... felt a bit too much....."
1,Very disappointing,"I love Paul McCarney's work and I particularly love Diana Krall's work, but this is a recording that never should have been made."
1,Don't Even Bother,I don't know how the reader Mikey from Canada can write a review to a book he admits in the last line he has NEVER even read and has the nerve to give it a 5 Star rating! His statement about the book being light reading is just stupid. The book reads like a scientific research journal. It is anything but light. It was obviously written for the psychiatric community and not the general public but having been written almost 50 years ago it is also incredibly outdated. There is nothing of interest to the AB community. The word diapers appears in the book only 3 times. I bought the book. I agree with Jamie. The books a total waste. Reading the dictionary would be more interesting.
4,Enterprise NetWork Security,"Hi Folks, this books is excelent, has many suggestions and explanations about security and hackers attacks, buy this books and enjoy your future"
1,Says Not for resale in many languages,"it should have said that the item is a tester. i combined the purchase with another 3.4 Ounces of Noah EDT for my wife as a gift.unfortunately, i had to get rid of the box because it was saying that it a tester and not intended for resale."
1,"Not the same product, doesn't smell like the original.","Not the same product, doesn't smell like the original.Probably old product.too expensive for the size.I don't recommend this product."
4,Work Well,"These work very well with connecting my Sony DVD player to Panasonic Plasma. Picture quality is good, as expected. Amazon had a good price and delivered them free of charge in a reasonable amount of time. My only concern is that the plastic covering/shielding on the ends of the cables is a little thick, and because my DVD player's outputs are very close to each other, the cables barely fit."
2,Did not see any difference,I did not see any picture quality improvement using this high priced Monster cable. I get the same quality pictures from my $ 8.00 cable bought from biglots. So purchased a HDMI cable. But believe me. The picture quality from my cheap component cable is still good( eventhough HDMI pictures are little better) when I compared with the pictures from HDMI cable.
3,Much shorter than the specs say,"We have our dvd player on a shelf directly above our television. If the cables were really 4 ft long, they would be perfect. But the cables are shorter than advertised and they fall out easily when the DVD player is moved. We had to push the DVD player toward the back of the shelf to lessen the tug on the cables. I dinged them 2 stars because I think it is unforgiveable to say something is 4 ft long when it is really much closer to 3 ft."
1,Oy vey!,"My old Celica was nearing 250,000 on the odometer when the rear shocks died. Decided to replace all four with Monroe's sensatracs. The 2 up front, these ones here, lasted less than 5,000 miles before going bad.Sigh."
5,mirror to the world,"I left out of my previous review that the author flawlessly used the art of language to bring the reader into the story. Though this Author is unknown, his use of the language reminds me of John Steinbeck. The hammer and nails that he uses to build his stories are world class. These are horror stories, feeling comfortable and warm inside is not horror and is not what the Author intended.He intends to educate us to the horror that is part of our everyday world. This is the source of discomfort that you feel while reading, it is the horror."
1,Don't Buy,"I ask that you read Mr. Smithson's review. As soon as it was entered, it appeared that two individuals sent in raves about Mr. Lances book, almost to the day. Prior to this, Lance's book remained largely unreviewed. I agree with Smithson. This book is terrible and beyond vulgar. Do not keep this volume close to where children have any chance of getting to it. I would not doubt if Lance himself wrote the raving reviews. If indeed he did write his own raving reviews than he is a bigger loser than he was when he paid somebody to publish his work. If you buy this book, you will probably find yourself offering it back used."
1,Poor Attempt,"Once again, this author actually paid to have this book published. This volume is a poor attempt at reviewing a very interesting subject. The editing is almost as bad as the writing content and grammar. This author needs to ""get a life"" and stop paying people to write his books."
1,Wierd,This book needs serious help. I agree with the previous critique; do not let this book near any children. This is beyond vulgar.
4,Say cheese.,"I've been expecting a Primus collection for years, and now that it's out I see it's rather good. It's a decent 16 tracks, and all the obvious choices are here. Three tracks each from the first four albums is pretty sweet also. Truth be known there's not much to complain about. The selections from ""Sailing The Seas Of Cheese"" and ""Pork Soda"" are chosen well. The only songs I would swap are ""To Defy The Laws Of Tradition"" and ""Southbound Pachyderm"", but they're both still good tracks. Adding ""Making Plans For Nigel"" or ""Mrs Blaileen"" would be sweet, but no biggie. Overall it's a great collection, and I'd say most of them are zingers. Clever artwork too."
2,Primus were always just a bit too out there,"With the exception of ""Wynona's Big Brown Beaver"" and ""My Name is Mud, it's true; they can't all be zingers (or in this case-good). Primus were always just a bit too out there. Their long and intricate bass solos, spoken word vocals, and hap-hazard lyrics come from a place and time in music history that I wouldn't mind forgetting. I have always respected Claypool as a bass player, but he's a lot more creative and tolerable with his solo work."
3,There are about 4 good songs and the rest.....,"Like most artists, you have more bad than good songs on a CD. Les is a bass genius but he only has a few good songs."
2,"220,000 words?","The advertized 220,000 words impressed me to buy but every word I don't know, this dictionary doesn't know. The last two words that come to mind are; eponymous and recrudescense. If I had thought to make a list, it would probably recognize one out of five entries. Someone should create a dictionary that eliminates simple words in order to make room for words that someone fluent in English would normally have to look up. For example, this would eliminate words like, chair, house, etc. to make room for a more effective list."
4,Can't Speak and Say?,"If you are like me with a thick southern accent that you just can't help. Well this little handy-dandy gadget works like a charm!! Just type in the word you aren't sure how to pronounce and press ""say"" and it speaks!!! Now since it is also a dictionary you don't have to worry if you can't spell the word. Just start typing away and Bam it finds your word! Bam just like that.I got this little device to help me in school. I am an older adult(30)ha!) going to college for my first time. The Seiko Talking Dictionary & Thesaurus has more then once been a life and a grade saver!! I would be so lost without mine!"
2,This thing is not worth the pay!!,This dictionary is not worth the pay. I bought this at $[amount] and it broke 1 week later. Don't think about calling Seiko because they just say that they can fix the screen (If it breaks) for $[larger amount]! Buy something that is a little more worth it !And this saying botton on the dictionary is Very stupid! You can Hardly hear the word because the person saying the stuff says it WAY TOO FAST. Dont buy this!
3,painfully slow,"I have been using it for just one day, and found several problems:1. The dictionary is painfully slow. It takes about 10 seconds to find a word, and, if you spell the word wrong and choose to do the spell check, it takes about at least 40 seconds.2. It seems that you cannot find some some obvious words, such as Chicago, omnidirectional, cutesy.3. Sometimes the voice does not match the pronunciation marked in phonetic symbols. For example, for the word traverse, the voice put the intonation on the first syllable while the phonetic symbols put it on the second."
1,I'm going to return it,"I have an American Heritage Talking Dictionary(AHTD) on CD-rom, 3rd edition, based on 92 ed dictionary. I bought it in 1995. It's very good. I can find most of medical terms, except those very specific ones. As a result, I didn't hesitate to buy this electonic dictionary. However, I am disappointed.I can't find most of medical terms in this products, like ramus, psoas, leukocytosis, adduction etc. All those words I can find in the AHTD CD-rom. I wondered how come the new dictioinary had less words than the old one. Then I checked the information on the back of the dictionary, it said it's based on the CONCISE AHD, 1982 edition. No wonder. Before I bought this electronic dictionary, I couldn't find such information on the web, only saw that dictionary has 220,000 words."
4,"Very cute option of ""jack in the box""","Very cute, but I was hoping for something my 1 year old could operate by himself. The turning handle is very hard to turn, as the handle you hold is flexible so it's hard to get a good grip. But the toy is very cute, and my son does enjoy playing with it while it remains open, or if someone plays with him with it."
1,It's not what it seems,"Doesn't last, the flower keeps up, impossible to close back, is heavy. There is no way a child can make it work, it requieres adults helps... wich has no sense for this kind of toy."
2,Overpriced at any price,"I purchased last Christmas for $3 and it wasn't worth that. The quality was substandard, it wouldn't wind properly and was tinny sounding."

3,Kinda sucks,"I tried twice according to the directions and it looked terrible both times. I agree with the other two reviews, the pink is way too opaque and light and on top of that ends up looking streaky. The third time I tried it I was almost out of guides so I just used the bottom coat then painted two coats of the pink on the tips and ended with the top coat. Best looking frenchie so far. Had I known I would have just chosen my own colors."
2,not good,This kit was a huge waste of money. The base coat peeled off when I removed the guide strips. The white polish is ok but the pink is horrible. It is not a flattering tone and it is too opaque and dries very streaky. would not purchase again.
3,not fully satisfied,This was just perfect except for the color you put on your nails. It was almost as white as the tips and not pretty at all.
3,Mans book,One Incredible Journey is a story of two men seeking to cross Canada by river and portage. The revised and updated edition also describes a man in the midst of a change and effectively rededicating himself to the challenge of the wilderness.
1,Poor video quality,I was surprised with how poorly this product performed in terms of the video component. Perhaps the audio cables caused increased interference with the video cable. The cheaper cables I was previously using are noticeably superior to these monster cables. Do not purchase.
5,"Great quality, not mislabeled.","These were exactly what I was looking for. I have a Laserdisc player and & modest collection to go with it. I needed some new cables and I wanted some that would give me good quality without any interference. I was originaly going to buy a pair of Bluejeans brand cables when I found this pack from Monster. I would never have expected this price for Monster cables.The length is great, the cables have nice connectors with good shielding. So I no longer have to wonder if it's the cables or the disc when I see artifacts during playback.Some people said these were mislabeled, they most certainly are not. The packages much like amazon says they were Composite cables.If I need to hook my old VCR up more than once or twice a year I'll buy another set of these."
5,Ant Killer,I wouldn't use anything else but this for those tiny sugar ants. We were infested last year and I used the outdoor shaker as well as the individual inside ant baits. Haven't seen one since.
5,It works!,"I had a bad fire ant problem in and around my screened in room. Spread this stuff around the house and they are completely gone. Wow...impressed with how effective this was. Tried other things to get rid of the ants, but it was this stuff that worked."
5,Excellent.,"There are a lot of lies about Pauls view of women. This book is good at telling what Paul really was saying about women, which always was said with love. It is clear that men and women are equal before God."
5,Bristow offers Fascinating insight Into Paul,"Inadequate understanding of languages coupled with cultural influences created an understanding of Paul that has led to Paul's being considered a male chauvenist. He wasn't.Bristow explains, simply, that Paul has been misquoted and misunderstood. This book provides a simple explanation of Paul that can be understood by most people in the pews. A wonderful insight into the real Paul."
4,Great book,"Informative, new idea on a subject that most people don't think about, I've always thought that Paul didn't care much about women."
1,"If there were zero stars, I'd award this book a zero","So...feminism is strictly un-Biblical. This book promotes women as being equal to men, but in reality man is designed to be head of the house and head of the woman. It's stupid to say that Paul allowed females to be equal to men, the scripture just isn't there."
5,Life changing!,"This book presents a researched view of certain biblical passages that are used to support the opinion that women are made to submit to men. Although Bristow presents the evidence along with his opinion and personal stories, he does not go so far as to proclaim that his book offers the only possible answer. Since this book discusses theology, which is opinion of the bible, that is to his credit. The case he builds is a strong one. This book is NOT revising scripture any more than a more traditional view did before it became popular enough to be considered truth.Although I enjoyed reading this book and agree with the basic ideas, I think it is important to read this book along with other books. It is after all best to develop informed opinions instead of assuming you are right:)"
1,"OhmeGod, what a joking movie!!","Totally ridiculous, wasted a lot of money on the meaningless dynamite, gasolin and the explosions are absolutely unnecessary. The movie script is done by a 5th grader I think, so funny, shallow and so clueless, wasted Walken. The problem of this actor is that since he won the best supporting actor in the Deer Hunter, all the movies he decided to play a role... big time, no matter it's a mob story or anything else, except one movie that was seriously enough to be treated as a not bad movie, The Dog(s) of War."
4,One Of The Best ( Crusade In The Pacific ),"A truly outstanding, detailed account of WW2s Pacific Campaign. Rich in info and great footage, this is easily one the THE BEST WW2 documentaries ever produced, they don't make shows like this anymore. Far superior to most WW2 documentaries that have been made in the last 30 years, this is a must have for anyone interested in WW2 and highly educational in demonstrating why we must fight."
4,"Beautiful book, but definitely not complete","This is a beautiful book on stenciling and many stencils are provided. But don't be misled by the title: it is not complete. Just about all the stencils in this book are of flowers and leaves (ok, an olive, one chicken and one duck stencils are also included). If you are looking for fun things to decorate a kid's room (other than flowers and leaves), this is not the book for you.Also, if you are like me and want to see the effect of a particular stencil on a room or looking for inspirations to use the stencils creatively, there are very few pictures of a finished room in this book. You may see a section of a doorway, or a table top, but that's about it."
1,"Non-existent Customer Service, flimsy product",Product did not arrive with the drawer dividers as stated in the description. Storage cabinet is rather flimsy too. Emailed Aut0Barn twice and no response. Called them (during their stated business hours) and I got got their voicemail. The voicemail allowed about 5 seconds of recording time. Do not order from this vendor!!
1,Flimsy,"i guess you get what you pay for...this cabinet has no back to it, so everything is still exposed to dust and hair...the drawers don't stay in very well, and they are cheaply made...if it wouldn't cost almost as much to send it back, I would return!"
3,Size,"Object says ""large drawers"" but drawers are awfully tiny. There is another one listed without dimensions, but are the same one. I would recomende this if using it for small things like jewelery, nails, screws, and makeup. But if for anything larger i would not recomend."
2,Tutorial for his own library,"I used this book in an intermediate level Java course taught by the author. It covers a great deal of territory, and it does so without the mind-numbing detail of, for example, Deitel's Java: How To Program. That said, it depends very heavily on its author's open source DocJava API. As other reviewers have said here, that library is not without its bugs, which are reproduced in the text. And the proofreading is less than perfect. I would not use this as a primary text for learning Java, but as an example of one way to build a library in Java. Another edition, with the code more thoroughly tested and the library code more carefully separated from the Sun library code, would improve the text greatly.That said, I learned a lot from the author, and from his frequent co-author, Maynard Marquis, who teaches at the same University."
5,Great Product,"Discovered it while shopping in Tokyo of all places. Product works to tame my unruly coarse, curly and frizzy hair."
1,Crunchy!,"I cannot explain how much I dislike this product. I have this and the Direct Leave Ink, I hate them both. They both left my hair extremely crunchy. I have 100% natural, 4b, highly textured hair and it just did not work at all. Period. I will never purchase either product ever again!"
3,This was okay for me!,"I have 4b hair and heard a lot of good things about this product. Therefore, I purchased it and could not wait for my wash day. This product was okay, I did not think it detangled my hair that well or gave it that much moisture as promised. I will continue to use it and hopefully my opinion will change. But for now, I don't think I will buy it again."
5,Lush and Smooth,"I am so overjoyed with this product! It is very moisturizing. I use it in lieu of shampoo, and my hair responds very well. I wet my hair completely, apply this product, detangle, let it sit while I am distracted, and then rinse. My hair is very soft and has better curl definition. It is also more moisturized. I'm now sold on this product (and the Triple Threat conditioner for deep cleansing), and I will be chucking my chemical-ladden products that were professing to be deeply moisturizing but instead ripping off my pockets and making my hair look and feel like a brilo pad. This conditioner is made in the USA, has natural ingredients, is animal cruelty free, inexpensive, and actually does what it says on it's labeling. Yea! Btw I buy it in bulk (pkg of 3)."
3,I am allergic,"Everytime I put this conditioner on my hair it makes my scalp burn. Letting my daughter use it, she does not have the same results. So the search continues."
4,Love this conditioner,"This conditioner is wonderful. Very satisfied, and definitely agree with the title ""smooth as silk"", my hair feels wonderful and the conditioner has a wonderful scent. Only gave it 4 stars because I wish the cost were a little lower."
2,not all bad,"The first item covered is ""be aware of your surroundings"" that alone can make all the difference.In the begining of the video, he teaches a very good move that can enable you to get away if you are being held from behind, like a bear hug. This move alone is a good reason to buy the video, however, most of the rest teaches moves that would help you if your drunk friend or family member wants a fight. He doesn't focus as much on wounding your opponet, mostly just stopping them or creating distance, that's why I only gave it 3 stars."
1,Very Disappointing,"This book is so poorly written (and so obviously not edited) that it is difficult to deal with more than a page at a time. It's too bad because there is an urgent need for a good treatment of this topic; while I tried to read it on a recent train trip, two different people noticed the title and asked me where to find it."
1,Hard to get anything out of,"As a current practicing software development project manager, I was hoping for strategies of engagement, tips and tricks on how to work best with stakeholders, and common best and worst practices. Unfortunately, this book reads like a glommed-together survey of current research and techniques. Tips like ""have a defined methodology for your project"" aren't helpful to me. I really wasn't able to get anything useful to my day-to-day life out of this.On the other hand, if I was looking to write a paper on the field of stakeholder management, this seemed to provide a pretty wide introduction and set of pointers into the literature and current research."
2,Worse Than It Looks,"Christy's book was obviously written for someone doing a Kerouac paper in their high school English class. This is the type of biography you wish had never been published. The fact that it is in print seems to validate what Christy has written. There is so little presentation of known fact--more hearsay and legend than anything else. For instance, Christy claims Kerouac's last words were, ""It must have been the tuna fish."" I'm shocked neither Charters nor Nicosia were able to dig up this information--but Christy was? Who will be the next self-proclaimed ""Beat Researcher"" to cash in on the Kerouac revival? This book is on par with ""The Kerouac We Knew."" Yet another shoddy attempt at exploiting Kerouac's celebrity."
4,Lighten Up!,"If you like your pet tales told with a little bite you'll love ""What the Dog Did"". There are plenty of stories here that are for the warm and fuzzy folks but also plenty of stories told with a wry wit that characterizes all of Yoffe's work. There may be something about her style that needles some folks (judging from some enraged reviews!!!!) but most folks looking for a sharp, truthful telling of the ups and downs of pet ownership will really enjoy this book. I know I did."
3,Mostly Amusing,"WHAT THE DOG DID is a light self-deprecating look at author Emily Yoffe's slow initiation into dog ownership and even slower grasp of how to manage dogs. Note: She in no way suggests anyone should ""try these things at home."" What comes through loud and clear is her love for dogs and her determination to help as many as she can."
5,What the Dog Did: Tales of a Formerly Reluctant Dog Owner,"This is the FUNNIEST book in the WORLD! If you are a dog owner, you with joy! If you are not a dog owner, you will jump with joy! I read this book in one day! I couldn't take my eyes off it! Buy it today!"
1,Not funny,"I was eager to purchase this book based on the enthusiastic reviews both on Amazon and in print. Imagine my disappointment when I found that I could hardly finish the book! A dedicated owner of four intelligent, well-socialized, handsome and friendly Boston Terriers I was for one thing insulted by the malicious humor used by the author to discuss her encounters with Boston Terriers. Although she claims she always wanted one, she certainly did a job of demeaning their intelligence, socialization, looks (her daughter was afraid their eyes would fall out), etc. In fact, her comments about just about every other breed were malicious and I didn't enjoy the ""killer dog"" stories at all. If I had a relative with dogs like that I would never tell anyone. It was a struggle to keep reading and I never did find much I felt I could ""laugh out loud"" about. In fact, I found myself wondering if the author really liked dogs at all. Very, very disappointing."
1,"Bad writing, bad person","The author just wrote an article bragging about how she murdered her cat. Yeah, sure, buy her book about pets - that is, if you'd like a purile, poorly written, monotonous pile of drivel, and enjoy wishing you had your money back."
5,Dog Gone Good,I am a big fan of the author's articles in Slate and looked forward to reading this book. It was flat out hilarious and I burst out laughing many times while on the subway. I've recommended this to many friends and family members and all have had the same reaction.
5,Fantastic movie,"This is a story that I can only hope and pray can be replicated in classrooms in America. When a new teacher stumbles into an impossible situation, she transforms the pedagogy she learned in college into making a difference in the lives of a group of teenagers. Amazing plot, fantastic acting (for the most part) and a story that resonates with my 16-year-old."
4,"Not the best film ever, but hey, it's not trying to be!","I wanted to give this film only three stars, but oh what the hell. All the kids did a pretty nice job acting and Swank does solid work, as usual. I found it to be much better than I thought it'd be. I was thoroughly entertained and though there are a few cliche moments, it's worth seeing in my opinion. It's a slightly fresher version of the classic teacher-rouses-students-into-learning formula.Plus I've read the book and this did a nice job of portraying the kids' original diary entries. There is a lot of truth here. We had to watch it once in my writing class senior year and the whole class loved it. I highly recommend you watch it if you're a teacher; it gives you perspectives from all around, the students, the faculty, everybody."
5,GREAT PRICE FOR A HARD TO FIND MOVIE,We had been to just about every store that sold videos before I found this on Amazon. EXCELLENT price and it was in stock and only took a couple of days to receive!!
4,Best January Release in Years,"Hilary Swank gives another bravura performance as a teacher trying toreach ghetto teens who would rather fight than learn. The formula hasbeen done many times, but this one really was powerful, and by the endit came across as a very good film. It really offered some new ideasfor reaching hard to help students, both socially and academically. Ifyou stayed away from this film because it came out in January, rent itor buy it and see why I think it was among that years better pictures."
4,Inspiring!,"Life may not be perfect but what an amazing way to cross the barriers of poverty,race,sex,and bias within a school system..This movie has inspired me to touch others and teach them in less formal ways yet reach them at the core of their soul."
5,educational standpoint,"As a high-school teacher for English foundations, I use this movie as a great motivational tool to get help my students become more at ease in their writing for standardized testing. I strongly recommend using this dvd to support your curriculum to teach on all levels of student learning (auditory, kinesthetic, visual)."
4,swank's credible performance is heart of this feel-good flick,"yes, the saintly teacher/coach in a down and out school has been done many times before. and yes,this based-on-real-life story has a predictably happy ending.and yet...I wholeheartedly recommend this as a genuine feel-good movie largely due to swank's believable performance as a preppy rookie teacher who goes to the projects to make a difference. swank creates a convincing mix of naievete, determination, passion and, yeah, sex appeal to the movie. the actors who play her students are uniformly good and the teacher's connection between the kids' experience and anne frank is particularly compelling."
4,Good Movie,My daughter told me about this movie. Gave us a chance to spend time together. The kids in the movie were inspiring.
3,Good subject matter plus Arena Football 1 in the film!,"Hilary Swank is pretty good anyway, butwith an Arena Football 1 connection inhere, I had to give it @ least threestars. Any mention of the sport in thepopular culture is worth picking up on.Signed, An Arena Football Original,Rich Salzer, Chicago and Miami"
1,streamline,"was bad, we must to wait many stops, waiting for download movie, we saw this movie in more than two hours."
2,Freedom Writers,"Do not buy from this seller. It took FOREVER for the dvd to be mailed to me. I was very disappointed when I received the dvd as the case was not in good shape at all. However, the dvd has only minor scratches. The description was inaccurate, saying it was in excellent shape. It's not in excellent shape."
1,awful...,"the movie is a total bomb in every way, starring high school dropout hilary swank as a teacher trying to convince kids not to...drop out. the real story is a rehash of stand by me, the substitute, etc. i'm sure you could find 2 dozen previous examples of 'teacher who believes in at-risk youths' or 'teacher who cares when no one else did'. and they'd all be better than this nonsense. in addition, the kids (from all backgrounds) are all so cliched it's ridiculous. pass on this."
3,Hmm,"I prefer classic flicks like Dangerous Minds and Lean On Me over Freedom Writer. Still, this film is still somewhat inspiring."
3,Freedom Writers DVD,"Purchased for a class paper. Interesting story, probably a fictionalized account based on true events. Well done, plotline does make you feel for the characters. Good acting as well."
3,Makes You Think,"This movie will strike you immediately about the impact education has on our young and the difficulties they face every day. The story is pretty serious and based on true events; I was disappointed in the ""state of family values"" that is accurately portrayed in the movie, but this is the reality of our day. This isn't a ""family movie"", but it is a movie worth taking a look at for teachers and people who are trying to think about how to tackle the problems we face in our society."
4,An Unsung Feel Good Movie,"Without trying to sound like Roger Ebert, I am going to keep this review simple. The story is very predictable but who cares, Hillary Swank is on top of her game as a young naive teacher in an inner-city school in LA. She has the forgotten children, warehouse them and hope they drop out before senior year. She bucks the system and realizes that failure is not an option.She reaches out to the children by having the read ""The Diary Of Anne Frank"" which shows her kids that they are not alone on feeling like they are victims in an unforgiving world.You will need a box of kleenex to get through this movie and even though his role is very small, Scott Glenn shines through as Hilary's father who stands behind his daughter and realizes that he too has much to learn from her students.This movie will make a great stocking stuffer."
4,Very inspirational,"As it has been mentioned, we've seen similar plots and storylines before. And sure, it has the MTV, mass-consumer audience, in mind.So what? This movie delivers successfully exactly what I had hoped it would. It shows me how strong Erin Gruella's passion for teaching was, and how it affected these students. Countless other films have shown this already: Lean on Me, Stand and Deliver, and Gruella again in Dangerous Minds, to name a few.. but so what?Perhaps it is because I am a sucker for inspirational films that give me hope in light of our human condition, but this film is an obvious winner to me. I don't always need fresh, innovative ideas to be interested. Just enough conviction to feel convinced. And this film gives me that.I highly recommend it to anyone needing to reconsider what this great big whirligig of a ride is all about...."
4,Excellent,"I loved this movie, it's got a great cast-chemistry, decent writing, though it's a cliched premise, it's still got heart.And, it was based off of a true story.I'd say, read the book after watching the movie. AFTER being the keyword."
4,inspiring!,"I thought this movie was really excellent. Yes, it may seem similar to movies such as dangerous minds. But the way the story used the holocaust to teach I thought was very different and such an interesting way to relate to the teenagers in the film. Knowing this was based on a true story made it very inspiring! Makes you think maybe teachers can still really TEACH and encourage their students to do something outside of the box. I think Mrs. G was a very noble character and Hilary Swank played her with a lot of heart and emotion. The only real problem I had with the movie was that Patrick Dempsey's character is not very well rounded. His character could have been expanded to make him more multi-faceted."
4,Teachers with Passions,"The setting is 1992 in Calif. Where one teacher bound with determination gave of herself. In a multi-cultural society where children do not know where to turn. Where their gang affilation is their authority. The best part in the picture for myself was the center line, to show the children how very much alike they truly are. With no racial discrimination what a world it would be."
2,dissapointing,"i recently received the movie ""freedom writers"", only to discover it was the canadian version! it is in french and english all over the case and in the movie itself."
1,"It's a Movie about Writing, Badly Written","Leaving no cliche unturned, Freedom Writers is another in a long line of ""uplifting"" movies about inner city school kids moved to greatness by a struggling, selfless rookie teacher. I'm sure the true story upon which this disaster was based was indeed inspiring, but this movie was realized in such a leaden, ham-fisted and amateurish fashion, it took all of the self-discipline I could muster to keep watching through to the end. Barely literate high-school students, suddenly handed empty journal books, magically transform into brilliant writers. Character development, especially that of the school's faculty and administrators is limited to minimal cardboard stereotypes. Baffling subplots serve to make the film seem even more intolerably lengthy. Hillary Swank looks great, though.If you want to see a story about inner city education brilliantly and honestly portrayed, check out season 4 of HBO's ""The Wire""."
1,Drama + Biography does not = Documentary,"Why does amazon list movies that are ""based on a true story"" as documentaries? Hey Amazon, Hilary Swank is not a teacher. Perhaps you should use that free dictionary that comes loaded onto your Kindle and learn the definintions of ""biography"" and ""documentary"". They're actually different words, with different meanings. Stop miscatagorizing things. It makes trying to use your video service a HUGE waste of time."
5,Just Gorgeous!,"**Please see review from Walls of the Wild Dolphin 2**Just gorgeous! I purchased this wall decal for our daughter's bedroom....wow!About 3 weeks prior, I painted her walls in eggshell finish. I wasn't totally sure if it would stick securely, so I purchased Super 77, just in case, but no need for it."
4,Red Whitney And Blue,"I'm not enamored of absolutely everything Whitney Houston ever recorded. As a friend once said, ""Pick a NOTE and stick with it."" That always gave me a chuckle: all that gospelly glissando COULD get on my nerves. But at her peak (and when she was on her game), Whitney really could be spectacular.She was here."
5,Wonderful!!!!,"This woman sings this song so well I love to hear her sing this version of the Star Spangled Banner the words are so clear and voice so nicely high pitched and strong so anyone who likes the Star Spangled Banner purchase this single becasue Whitney really uses her vocal cords on this track this is a wonderful version of the ""STAR SPANGLED BANNER"" RAY CHARLES- SINGS THE BEST VERSION OF ""AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL "" IN MY EYES!!!!"
2,Over rated.,"I listened to all the hoopla, and so bought the cd expecting something really outstanding. But instead what I heard was a poorly produced song. The singing was good but not that great either. It would have sounded better if they had went in a studio and recorded the song. I could hear wind, and her voice was fading in and out. Terrible. I suggest God Bless America for a better treat. I think people forget this was recorded 10 years ago, and it doesn't compare to the sounds and singers we have thse days. Sorry whitney. The drums sounded good though."
2,Pop stars doing pop versions...,"They've never really listened to the words. Listen to Sandi Patty's version and...just listen.... to the words about our country, not about pop stars getting tv time."
3,Star Spangled Banner,Whitney Houstons version of the Star Spangled Banner is one of the best I've ever heard and her version of America The Beautiful is good to.I love the cd single but I think the studio could have done a better job on the audio level on the Star Spangled Banner.It's not as loud and clear as America the Beautiful and sounds like theirs a flutter in the track.Also I think the packaging could have been better since it's easyto scratch the cd or put finger prints on it when you take it out.
5,WOW!,"I was compeltely blown away, hearing this for the first time. Nobody can sing better than Whitney, and nobody will ever. This is a great rendition. 10/10"
5,The best version ever!!!!!,"The VOICE has made a nice gesture, she's donating all the profits from this cd to aid those poor people.And the song gives me goosebumps!"
4,Stars & Stripes Eternity,"Out of all the people who've capatalized on recording The Star Spangled Banner, nobody has done it better than Whitney Houston. When she recorded it in 1991, it captivated a whole nation and beyond. The song was reisssued as a single in 2001, to reflect upon after 9/11. Although her version is magnificent from the 1991 Super Bowl, it just seems to be overdone. The song was issued previously for her 2000 Greatest Hits record, which still remains present. If you have her Greatest Hits record, this single isn't really worth buying. Still, Whitney Houston's voice is still a one of a kind melody, this song could always be bought as a backup for the free and the home of the brave."
1,screw up,can't really review this product since I haven't received it yet. What's going on? This is the 2nd time that apparently you people gave out the wrong address
1,BUYER BEWARE !!,THIS DVD IS LISTED AS NTSC -- BUT IT IS NOT -- IT IS IN PAL FORMATTHAT'S WHY THE ONE STAR REVIEW !
2,Not very well made,"I looked far and wide to find an eco-friendly stuffed animal for my son. I was happy to find this little cute monkey. But, after only a few months, the threading that links the head to the neck is showing A LOT. Frankly, I don't know how long it is going to stay connected. It wouldn't be a big deal if this toy was played with a lot or my son had had it for a long time but that is not the case. It's rather disappointing."
4,"Ok, overall","I really like this toy, but my son is rarely interested in playing with it. I was hoping he'd teeth on it since it's washable and made of organic cotton. Unfortunately, my kid is more interested on chewing on my phone and whatever else he's not supposed to be teething on!"
5,A Great handguide for Christian unity in the Church,"This book lays a good foundation for the Christian reader - in the three areas of Generality, Speciality and Practicality of Christian unity. In Generality we learn the five basic points of the Christian faith. In Speciality we learn how to contend for the Christian faith in a proper way according to the Scriptures against heresy and degradation in the Church universal, and lastly in Practicality a way for practical church living is presented. This book is a must for Christians who want to find the keys to Christian unity. The truths presented are simple yet profound."
1,Useless - Can't believe Amazon is selling this Junk,I just purchased this item and looking at the cover thought it would be useful. I have called Amazon and asked for refund because the item is only 6 pages long is nothing better than a WhitePaper you can find on any website for free and is completely useless to anyone.I am amazed that Amazon allows trash materials (not a book) such as this to be posted and sold on their website. I sure hope Amazon understands that customers do hold them somewhat responsible that if they say something is an EBook that implies at least a basic level of publishing and content quality.
4,Great Pirate Boots!,"I bought these boots to wear on Halloween with my sexy pirate costume. They were perfect! Great quality for the price and the heel height is comfortable for walking or standing for long periods. The boots arrived well before the expected ship date giving me plenty of time to ""tweak"" my costume (I changed out the black laces at the back of the boots for red satin ones to add a bit of flair). I would definitely recommend these boots and this company."
1,runs very small,"I wear a size 11B. Some boots I have found I can surprisingly wear a 10 or at least try it on for general look and feel then order an 11B. This boot fit like a 9.5. It is comprised of very thin material, obviously not real for the price, but very cute. They can be folded down for the knee height look. I would say it runs 1.5 sizes small, and would work for a costume if you could get a size big enough (1.5 sizes larger than your normal size), but I can't see it standing up to regular wear. I also bought a pair of Chinese Laundry thigh highs for about the same price. Those 11's fit great. They are comfortable and sexy. I could even wear thin-average thickness socks with the Chinese Laundry thigh high boots, and they feel more comfortable to stand in. I will get a lot of wear out of the CL's."
3,Why No Ankle Zipper?,"These are okay. I have other boots from this company that I prefer simply because they have an ankle zipper. These are real hard to put on and get off without the cardboard base in the heel bending. An ankle zipper would have made sense. Otherwise, they are comfortable and decent quality."
1,Unbelieveable,"I saw this movie on Netflix and I thought it was going to be very educational. I am a Presidential expert and I enjoy increasing my knowledge by these type of films. However, this film had my dropping my jaw because of the inaccuracies. They had the numbering of the Presidents completely off, the years they were in office, COMPLETELY off, even some of the facts were not true. I thought it was a joke at first and then I realized, IT WASN'T. Never in my life have i seen a historical film with such inaccurate information. I suggest NEVER buying this product because it will lead you astray!"
3,Image is everything,"Skip this book if you're looking for details into the reigns of these monarchs or specific instances of foreign policy, etc. This book mostly discusses the image of the kings, as the title suggests. There is little mention of Charles I's attempt to rule without his Parliment, but instead concentrates on his exquisit art collections, his vanity and his self-image. There is more written about Charles II and how his exile shaped his personality and made him so markedly different from his father. The book itself is small and is a fast read. It is a great character sketch on these two Kings."
5,THE BEST!,"I READ ALL THE REVIEWS AVAILABLE AT THIS SITE FOR THIS PRODUCT PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE. THERE WERE ACTUALLY A FEW NEGATIVE REVIEWS!I KNEW TWO FELLOW WORKERS WHO OWNED THE EARLIER MODELS, AND THEY NEVER COMPLAINED AND WERE NOTED FOR BUYING TECH EQUIPMENT WHICH IS THE BEST OF THE BEST.\THEY WERE RIGHT! THE 3835 IS A MARVEL AND EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THE SOFTWARE IS UNBELIEVABLE. I WISH MY DESKTOP COULD PERFORM LIKE THIS AND I HAVE A DELL DIMENSION 8100 WITH THE M/E SOFTWARE."
5,Great PDA,"This is an excellent, reliable PDA, with lots of features for use at home and at work. The more you use it the more new features you find. It is a good idea, however, to get a battery pack as the built-in battery runs down pretty quickly if you go on a trip and do not have a power cord. ..."
2,IPaq 3835 - Pin Problems,"I owned the IPAQ 3835 for about 4 months. One day when I put it in the cradle, it just totally stopped performing, black screen, couldn't access anything. I sent it back and am told that the pins are bent...The unit does not get hard use, I am the only user. I don't jam it into the cradle. These things have to be sturdy enough to go in and out of a cradle constantly. If the pins bend that easily, what's the point of paying to get it fixed? Got a total run around at HP/Compaq. Not a known problem etc. I have also had problems with the back light as has been mentioned by many others. This is not a prime time product. I feel as though I wasted hundreds of dollars. Think hard before buying this item."
2,Great device could be better.,Pros: multiple uses beyond what I expected in a handheld. Very clear and bright screen.cons: major problem with the backlight going out. This required 3-5 soft resets per event and about 3 events per day. This problem is discussed and really not adequately addressed by Compaq. This is annoying in a product costing over 600 US dollars after expansion etc.
1,ERASED ALL MY MICROSOFT OUTLOOK CONTACTS,"The Compaq Ipaq comes with a CD that contains Outlook 2002 and Active Sync 3.5. When I tried to upgrade the program on my desktop,it erased all my contacts and said it couldn't find the .dll file. So now I'm stuck with an IPAQ with not contacts to store in it - - what's the point of that? Compaq tech support directed me to Microsoft; Microsoft directed me to Compaq."
1,unreliable,"you know what, ive used pocket pc when it first came out, i thought there was absolutely nothing wrong with it, but over the time the memory expanded and it became so slow and sluggish. i was wrong to think that microsoft os and compaq had actually sone something decent in the field of computers and electronics. i just hace to say that i was very dissappointed with the new pocket pc and am returning mine, i have had much better luck with sony and its HARDWARE. it is slow and becuase it is so slow you cant even tell the difference between crashing and processinge, im through with them. sorry, but i dont want it."
2,Not a Palm Pilot killer yet...,"I purchased the Ipaq 3835 December of 2001, and i had owned a Palm Vx already... I fully expected a large number of differences between the two, so far i've been disappointed. There are a few advantages to the Ipaq and to Windows CE over Palm; seamless syncing with Outlook, a portable internet explorer that beats Palm's, the fact that with a portable version of Microsoft Money, i can keep my checkbook on my Ipaq; but with those exceptions, i'm doing the same things i was doing on the Palm. The ipaq does have some limitations too, the battery goes fairly fast, especially with the 16 bit color display. Windows CE, like all it's relative OS's, is a memory hog and i find i have to reset my unit more than i ever had to with my Palm. And at the price, it's difficult to rationalize the Ipaq over the Palm. I've spent the last few months thinking about it, if my Ipaq ever died, i'd more than likely get a replacement Palm."
4,"Great Product, but wish it had CF slot.","After seriously considering the Toshiba e740, I decided on the iPAQ 3835 because of the iPAQS proven track record and for a larger choice of 3rd party add-ons. I have had it for a month and so far no problems!I wish it had built-in 802.11b and CF slot, but I decided I would rather have a robust Pocket PC (as opposed to what I have seen in some of the e740 reviews).I also recently purchased the Pocket CoPilot 3.0 Jacket Edition and am shocked at the abundance of functionality and preciseness of this technology. Incidentally, here is no Jacket Edition available for the Toshiba!"
5,Absolute Best PDA On The Market!,"Where to begin......This PDA has more options than a swiss army knife. I particularly enjoy the close operating system with windows, which are both very alike. You can easily place applications right into folders, just like windows!The only bad comments that I can think of are, I can't find a place to download Pocket Access, all the software costs about [$$$] ( even for games like monopoly ), and it often locks up on me, probably my fault anyway.Overall if you are looking for a pda and are having difficultly choosing and don't want to end up making a bad mistake, then quickly order the Compaq iPaq 3835, which by the way has a much better name than: Palm, Toshiba, or ViewSonic. Plus the unpararlled color display, wide screen, almost infinte program list, mp3 enabled, and ability to do whatever you want makes me rate this product a 5 ***** 5 star program!!!"
3,Love/Hate relationship,"I think a lot of the good press this device has gotten is based on comparison with Palm devices. The iPaq does have a superior display and a much wider, more useful selection of software to choose from. However, the unit that I have locks up often and requires me to do a soft reset. What a pain. I've also had a lot of trouble with programs not working when the memory card is inserted. Don't get me wrong, I would not trade my iPaq for a Palm, but I wish my pocket PC wasn't as fussy as my desktop PC. I'll give it 5 stars when it works right, every time I turn it on."
4,A great tool,"I received this PDA as a graduation present. It hasn't failed to amuse or organize my life. The only real complaint that I have is that sometimes things are slow when running multiple apps. Also, the sync feature isn't exactly flawless. These problems are inherent with anything this compact and powerful. All in all though, buy it, it won't disappoint. I carry my resume, emails, excel files, pictures, mp3's, etc and it works great once you learn to optimize certain programs for speed. The dashboard program is way too slow to be functional for my purposes. People can't hardly believe the capabilites of this little thing. It's faster than about 50% of the computers here at work."
4,2nd compaq handheld,"Owned an Aero 1550, upgraded, Great little machine, wished it had built-in flash card slot. I highly recommend it. It does all I expected and more. The price was great also..."
1,Faulty product,"I bought the product, exchanged it a couple times, and finally returned it. This model has a problem with the sound card or something (The alarm ends with a breaking noise)Since I love the IPAQ, I think I will wait for the 3870."
3,Typical Microsoft Operating System,"I went from a Palm PDA (Palm OS) to a Compaq IPAQ 3835 because I think the color and features are superior than Palm, and they are in the 3835. HOWEVER, I really miss the Palm OS, it is the best around. Microsoft cannot get it right even in a Pocket PC. The first day I had the 3835 it locked up on me and I had to do a soft reset. Never happened with a Palm. Several soft resets later... Today I loaded Dashboard software from the disc that Compaq sends with the 3835 and everything went haywire. It was so locked up I had to do my first (and I am sure not last) HARD reset! I wish the US Government people would do away with Microsoft and Bill Gates. He belongs sweeping floors somewhere! Why doesn't Palm come out with an OS for computers?"
4,A delightful comeback to the celtic-inspired Moonshaes!,"More Moonshaes, more Earthmother, more Mayhem! The Prophet of Moonshae follows up on a tradition of good storyline, narrative and mystery. I hooked up for a whole day to read it head to toes, as well as the others. Moonshae has a different flavor from the Realms that is both refreshing and delighting especially for fans of druidic fantasy."
2,More of the same,"If you already read the first trilogy set in Moonshae, there is little need to bother with the second one. More of the same - great menaces threaten the island peoples' existance and only the work of our heroes saves them. How many times does a small nation face the brink of destruction before it becomes totally unrealistic?"
4,Overall Awesome,This is great for the price. Sounds awesome way better than I thought it would. So far no major cracks and I play pretty hard.
1,Poor Value,"The eight-discs means eight movies and six of those can be found in the 50 Movie Sci Fi Classics collection. I had a feeling that this might be the case, but couldn't tell from the Amazon product description. I'm returning the item, so no harm-no foul, but I thought I should let everyone know. It's a poor value."
3,Too much for these flicks.,"The movies an this DVD set are# The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues (1956)# The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1959)# Teenagers from Outer Space (1959)# First Spaceship on Venus (1959)# The Last Woman on Earth (1960)# The Phantom Planet (1961)# The Atomic Brain (1964)# They Came from Beyond Space (1967)While all are classic Sci-Fi B-Movies, most are available in other cheaper collections. I recomend the 50 movie packs if your looking for bargain B-Movies."
3,the transfers look clean and for the price not bad,nice looking transfers and some fun movies(i did have some of them in other collections). the price is right and you may like this little set.
5,Stunning,"The most important issue to consider while watching this documentary is how unbiased and simply done it is. Ms. Pelosi took a video camera to various John McCain rallies around the country during the 2008 presidential campaign and asked various people attending how they would feel if Barack Obama won, both as a Democrat but primarily as the first African American president. The answers she received were straight forward... there didn't appear to be any manipulative editing going on -- just people's honest opinions. This documentary is important. While prejudice exists everywhere, the die hard base of the Republican Party seem to own the ""rights"" to ugliness in such a mainstream way. It's unfortunate that this documentary shows the party in such a horrible light... but if the shoe fits..."
5,A Companion for the Summa Theologica,"Fr McCormick, SJ, writes a clear exposition of Scholastic Metaphysics. Only problem: the topic is weighty and the text is rather spare for a subject of such scope. He writes like Tacitus. This book is best suited for use in a class where the professor's explanation helps to elucidate the text.As a matter of fact, this book serves as a companion to the Summa Theoloogica! but, still, within a classroom environment. He quotes extensively from the Summa.Each chapter ends with a list of propositions to be proved, and he leaves it up to the students to do the proofs. ---not so handy for an old guy like me.NOVAYankee@AOL.com"
3,"Beautiful Book, too many typos","This is a excellent book and I highly recommend it. It has an abundance of wonderful stories, gorgeous photography, and unfortunately, a huge number of glaring typographic errors. I have rarely seen a book so thoughtfully designed contain so many mistakes! I hope they get it right in the next printing."
5,"To the Summit: Fifty Mountains that Lure, Inspire and Challenge","This book will make you want to strap on your backpack, grab your hiking poles and get out there! Gorgeous and challenging mountains and gorgeous book."
2,Pity from the shelf space ...,"I don't like this book at all. It has been hastily put together. The quality of the pictures is often mediocre. And the words accompanying the picture are a mere rehash of well-known facts. Other reviewers have already commented on typographic errors. Despite its size, this is not an inspiring book."
1,Faulty design is unusable without modification,"What other reviewers have said about damage to your equipment is correct.As these cables come new, the RCA male connectors require far too much pressure to successfully connect with a standard RCA female jack. With that much pressure, you risk unseating the female RCA jack on your equipment, or damaging the jack beyond repair. This is without question a design flaw, not a ""feature"".To safely use these cables with your equipment, you must first modify them by widening the diameter of the outer conductor (ring) of RCA male connectors with a tool. That is unacceptable.I would return the cables, but I have already damaged my equipment, and risked damaging the cables trying to modify them.Thankfully, I can repair the equipment myself."
3,Monster's deserved rep,"Monster has been pushing out incredibly overprices cables for years. Most people have gotten hip to the fact that for the 80 or 90 bucks Monster charges seriously good cables can be had. The end result is that stuff like this is now out there for 14 bucks. At 15 bucks these cables are serviceible and a fair deal.Odd thing is I have never seen plugs, especially RCA plugs made to fit so tightly! It is close to ridiculous. I guess Monster figured that audiophiles would appreciates trying to put a size 9 foot into a size 5 shoe. There's are tight and a pain to change. But they work and are a decent cable for 14 bucks and very stupid for more than that."
3,Must be factory 2nds,The cables I received are tight enough to cause damage when removing. I suspect Monster knows they have a bad batch and are blowing them out on Amazon. Sound quality is nearly equal to the free pair that came with my Pro-Ject 1.3 turntable with the Monsters being just slightly less transparent.
1,THIS CABLES SUCK!,i bought a pair of this cables last week when i plugged them into my receiver they broke .. monster says they are made of gold but there is nothing but plastic colored gold...i have bought many monster cables and i can say that some of their products are a good quality but super expensive..i regret buying this cables
4,"a very nice set of horror movies,a little pricey but worth a look","while i found the price a little high,the transfers were nice and the movies were very good.bewere though some of the movies maybe on other sets."
3,Decent,This is a book from the eyes of a hitch-hiker. It gives you a different view of that person standing by the road.
5,If you like guitar virtusos how did you miss this one....,"Picked this one up after hearing his Purple Rain track on my last.fm Mahogany Rush channel. Wanted the Purple Rain track only but took a chance on this album which is a compilation of alot of his other stuff. BOY was I rewarded. Hard to compare him to others or pidgeon hole his genre. Not blues, not heavy metal, more like fusion. My tastes usually run Eric Clapton, SRV, Jimi Hendrix, Joe Bonamassa, Jeff Beck, Albert Cummings, Kenny Wayne Shepard, Led Zeppelin (Jimmy Page). If you like any of these I do not believe you will be disappointed with this a great bargain at $8.99. You just need to be someone who LOVES electric guitar. Do yourself a favor and also download one of his tunes from a different album ""Rhapsody in Z"", for 99 cents it is the PERFECT one song sampler of his particular style."
1,"It sure is ""easy open""","If you're looking for an aluminium case for your 8125, stay away from this one. Very nice looking and it would make a good case. Except for one minor problem. The phone sits right into the case with no problem. Just don't try to cose it. While the length and width are perfect, the depth of the case is off (maybe due to the neoprene glued into it). It will close, but immediately pops open. No way, shape or form to get this case to stay closed and secure properly. Find another model. Afraid it's junk."
4,Protocol,"Goldie Hawn portrays the delightful Sunny Davis in this quirky movie. Sunny is a cocktail waitress that always seems to be on intimate terms with Murphy. Anything that can usually does go wrong for her. When she sees a man with a gun, and thwarts his plans, it is revealed later that an assassination was going to take place. Sunny has saved the Emir, and in the process takes a bullet in the tush. She is turned into a media darling overnight. A grateful government gives her a job in the protocol office, but that is only what appears to be on the surface. The Emir has decided that he wants Sunny for his next wife, and thus a deal is struck. When Sunny discovers what her government has done on her behalf, Washington will never be the same. I enjoyed Goldie and Chris Sarandon. They have chemistry, and great comedic timing."
3,GOLDIE BEING GOLDIE...,"This is an offbeat little film that showcases the ever adorable Goldie Hawn, who plays a cocktail waitress thrust into the spotlight when she singlehandedly thwarts an assassination attempt on a visiting Emir from a strategically placed, Middle Eastern country. Having taken a bullet in the butt during her heroic fight with the gunman, she becomes a media darling overnight, as she is a breath of fresh air. The media and the public gobble her up, while the White House staff, aware of her effect on the public, hire her to work in the protocul office. Unbeknownst to her, she is being used politically, and has been underestimated by the staff with whom she works. When she becomes aware of what is going on, she turns Washington on its head, and, in the process, completely changes her life. Good things do happen to good people. A cute movie, with a good cast, though not that many laughs."
3,Private Benjamin and Protocol were both GREAT movies,"Initially, (for those of us who grew up watching ""Laugh-In"")we never thought of Goldie Hawn as an ""actress."" However, she's demonstrated excellent acting talent in several of her movies, since ""Laugh-In."" ""Private Benjamin"" and ""Protocol"" do not disappoint in that area. Goldie's performances are top-notch in both. Both of these movies were well written [although ""Private Benjamin"" DID end abruptly with a few major issues NOT completely resolved].My biggest disappointment is that both movies come only in ""Full Screen."" I cannot understand why Warner Brothers has not yet released Wide Screen versions, by now. One would think that both would sell really well in Wide Screen."
1,"Great movies, but not closed captioned OR subtiled","These are great movies, just wish I could ""hear"" it with closed captioning or subtitles. In this day and age, I just can't comprehend why ANY movie is released without subtitles or CC."
4,With a little luck and the right attitude you can go far,"Cocktail waitress Sunny Davis (Goldie Hawn) gets shot in the posterior while impulsively saving a politician. Her heroism and notoriety eventually opens up an opportunity to wok in the U.S. foreign relations department as a hostess.She is tagged (unknown to her) to be come a member of a Middle Eastern household. By the time she finds out that she was really an exchange for oil rights, it is too late.Luck is with her and she learns something in the end. So do we."
3,Goldie in the Government.,"Goldie Hawn is highly likeable as a dim DC waitress who comes to the aid of a visiting royal and get's caught up in gonvernment plans for a strategic military base.The first third whereby Sunny Davis becomes an American hero and media darling is fantastic. One liners abound and a good time is had by all. The parade in Sunny's hometown, brought to you by Schmitter's Hardware, is so dead on. The film looses a bit of steam in it's mid-section (See the Safari Party) and get's a bit preachy and All-American in the end but the set-up and Hawn are terrific. Buck Henry's script is funny.Certainly no masterpiece but sometimes cute is just enough."
1,Needs a widescrren release,WB needs to rerelease this in widescreen. It ain't right to release widescreen filmed movies on dvd in Full screen only
5,Fun Movies/Should Have Better Special Features,"I like Private Benjiman, it's a cute movie, mainly because of Goldie Hawn. I absolutely adore Protocol, though, It's one of my all-time favorite movies. It's just too cute. My only complaint is that there aren't any subtitles. I have hearing damage and it would just be the icing on the cake if I could understand every single word."
4,Private Benjamin,Classic Goldie Hawn - I think this was her first dramatic role. Still ditzy but playing a strong woman.
3,ordinary America meets international relations,"When a D.C. cocktail waitress gets shot wrestling guy trying to shot a dictator,her life is turned upside down,and eventually the state department sells her toan Arab prince for an air base in his country.A silly comedy that makes the point thatthe American empire seems to have gone from bad to worsein dealing with other countries.I liked the movie."
4,NICE!!!,Im here to back these guys up -- this is good stuff!! Prog fans- come up with some more money!!
2,Save your money,"I spent at least 5 hours trying to get this thing to work, and once I got it working, I was extremely disappointed. I probably will go back to using the software that came with my DVD drive and may try to sell this thing. It only plays in fullscreen on a VGA monitor, so if you want to watch a commercial or preview you downloaded, it's gonna look awful. And if you want surround sound, you're gonna need a tuner. There are barely any adjustments for picture size, letterbox and widescreen look exactly same: distorted. So you're gonna need a tv, too. The only thing missing is a seperate DVD player, and I suggest you save your money and buy that instead of this monstrosity."
2,Not much of a biography,"Baxter's book is readable, but inadequately researched. Baxter is innocent of Spanish, and this means that many of the documents related to Bunuel are...well, Spanish, to him. It also leads to a number of egregious errors and, in general, to suspect judgements and thin interpretations. A number of questions need to be addressed in a biography of Bunuel, but Baxter either treats them superficially or ignores them. A definitive--or even semi-definitive, if such a thing exists-- biography of Bunuel is yet to come."
3,A pretentious point of view clouds this biography.,"I love reading about Luis Bunuel. ""Bunuel"" has a lot of great information, much of it I didn't know before. The, however, book loses it's wheels at some point. I believe this occurs when Baxter goes too far to define Surrealism. I found myself yearning for more details of Bunuel's life, but I kept reading about other surrealists and the mood of that era. He seems to speak down to the reader. The tone is very pretentious. I can't imagine Bunuel would have even like Mr. Baxter. As beautiful and twisted as Bunuel's life was, and as enjoyable as it was to read these things, Baxter's coldness found a way to shine through. Read it for the richness of Bunuel's life. The subject definitely saves this book."
4,monster cable,"Hard to find in stores. A rare commodity it seems today. Went to three different electronic stores and none had the exact product. So, I thought maybe I should try the internet and lo and behold,Amazon had it costing less than the original asking price. Placed the order and in two days it came in and fit right in. Good stuff!"
2,Monster no longer industry standard,"Monster products tend to be 5-25x (yes, times) more expensive than competing products with no noticeable quality difference. In this case it is no different. If you have an HDMI capable device I would recommend one of the $3-$ HDMI cables from Amazon or if S-video is your only option a less costly alternative."
5,Where did these reviewers come from?,"The album really deserves better reviews than its getting on Amazon. I'm kinda offended by the pointless remarks, for why it's a bad album. I'm sorry if the music is a little too layered and the lyrics take some thought to understand. I thought that was a good thing. I really enjoy this album. I feel every album they have made was another step forward. Demure was an amazing album, full of great vocals and guitar riffs. If I could describe the new album as a whole, Id say it's melodic masterpiece. Engine Down's vocals are very refreshing and original. The album builds until the breathtaking climax of the last song. The album for me is already aging well sounding better with every listen. Even with all the band has been through since the release (the loss of most of their equipment and merchandise in Texas) they still believe in the album. They had to borrow instruments just to finish their tour. It's one of the most rewarding albums I've come across. Listen to it."
2,Auto-drive,"Tepid emo-core is relatively competent but comparatively dull, this will primarily appeal to budding heartfelt punk aficionados hopefully working their way past it."
2,Very disappointing...,"I am not going to trash these guys, I still think they are talented musicians... but this album really cannot offer what the previous ones can. I am totally against all the labelling of bands, and dissing bands because they want to be heard. Good music should be put out there. But, in my opinion, this album just is not that good. I listened to it about 7 or 8 times the whole way through, and not one track really grabbed my attention... I understand that bands cannot, and should not, create the same thing every time around, but Engine Down, the guys who made a few of my favorite songs EVER, could have done more than this."
5,Good gift for a kid,"My daughter loves this book. She giggles at the descriptions and spends lots of time staring at the illustrations. Her favorite is a goblin named Follimal, the Grim Crimper, who ""[p]rides herself in the ability to make any mortal's hair look absolutely ridiculous by morning."" My daughter likes sharing books with friends, hoping that they will laugh at all the places she does, and Goblins is the perfect book for her - plenty to share and plenty to laugh at, whether you are 10 or 45. I like to give books as birthday gifts and this one is going to the top of my list for nieces, nephews, and the children of all of my friends. This book is funny and friendly (with just a dash of mischief and a fart joke or two), and I recommend it highly."
4,kind of funny,"The art in this book is truly great - true froud goodnes. The comic turn the bok tries to take is amusing, but bungling through some truly annoying long drawn out stories makes them far too dry and english for my tastes."
3,Satisfied,"It was ok. The acting, story and special were all decent. I reccomend it. The value was good too. I have bo complaints."
1,What a downer,"... I took a few test shots at high resolution, installed the software and hooked it up to a Win XP Home edition machine. Nice clear shots without fiddling with any of the options. How can you beat such high resolution, a flash and upgradeable memory for so little money?Edited: All subsequent shots were lousy. I don't know what happened but luckily I was able to return the critter."
1,A Big Disappointment,"O.K. So I did not want to spend a lot of money on a digital camera since I love my traditional film cameras, but I thought having a digital camera would be good for a marketing project I was doing for school. WRONG! This camera took the shoddiest picture I have ever seen. I saw better pictures years ago when the technology was just beginning to be offered to the general public. The camera never returned the actual frame area that I thought I had taken, I'm in the poor house due to the number of batteries I had to use just to finish my project (which only has about 15 pictures in it), and not having a preview screen is a bit of a hinderance. I will be returning this camera and investing a little bit more money and research the next time I buy a digital camera."
1,Whatever you do DONT BUY IT!!!!!,"Oh my, all i can say is I am returning it tommorow.Grainy pictures,cam is way worse,eats batteries every 10 pictures,how can concord put out a camera like this!"
1,Digital camera,It has been 6 weeks and I have still not received the camera they sent a smart media card instead. I have tried several times to have it picked up.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!,"I received this camera as a birthday gift. I have yet to get it to work on my computer. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the driver several times and I still cannot view the pictures on my PC. The tech support website is no help at solving the problem except to tell you what you already know. The editing software is great, but unfortunately I have not been able to use it. The other drawbacks to this camera are that it drains batteries like crazy and you cannot see the pictures until you load them into your computer. The flash takes so long to load that by the time it finally comes on, the picture-taking opportunity has passed. If I could actually get this camera to upload pictures to my computer, I might consider upgrading my rating to two stars."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE W/ WINDOWS XP,"I bought this camera cause it APPEARED to be a good deal for my first digital camera. I researched cameras & features, so I felt confident on comparing the deals & features. Couldn't find any reviews on Ritzcamera.com's site or anywhere else. I spoke w/ a rep at the company, they highly recommended the camera. The camera gets here, I find out it doesn't have a monitor so I can view my pics as I take them. I start downloading the enclosed software to find that the camera is not compatible w/ Windows XP. So, I can't offer any help w/ the type of pics it takes because I didn't get that far. :("
1,Not Impressed!,"The camera was purchased at a great deal. Features seemed desirable, however, the images were awful! Images were too grainy. Webcam images were even worse! Software was easy to upload and camera's upload feature was good."
3,"A little frustrating, but good pictures","Installing this camera onto Windows XP has been somewhat of a nightmare, I was never able to use the ""driver"" from the Concord website so I installed it with the original driver and for some reason now it works. My computer doesn't recognize the camera so I can't upload the pictures into any of my programs, I have to copy them and paste them into ""My Pictures"". But the minute I plug the camera into the computer, the pictures are instantly there. The picture quality is great, and the batteries are still fine (after 1 day.) However, I ran out of memory after 6 pictures. I guess I'll have to buy a CompactFlash card now."
1,concord eye Q 1300,"I am new to digital cameras, but I shouldn't be having this much trouble. I haven't been able to check it out very good because the batteries are dead before I can figure out what I'm doing. The icons are so small on the camera that I have a hard time to figure out what they are. So I'm very disappointed in the fact that it eats batteries so quickly. And they seem to die when I've got the cable hooked up to the computer. I shut the camera off and on again, playing with the mode button and the select button, and somewhere along in there, the batteries are dead. Am I doing something wrong? ..."
2,What did I know it was my first,"I bought this camera cause it was the best price I had seen. However, the shot is off from what you see in the view. There is no LCD screen so unless you have the picture offness in your head you have no idea if it is a good shot... which is the secondary reason I wanted a digital camera."
4,recon2756,"a great watch, i purchased the watch as achristmas present for my wife and she loves it, comfortable to wear, great l.e.d. read out, of course timex reliability. would purchase it again."
1,Its OK to be a jerk if you're good-looking apparently,"Augustus T. Riley is a celebrated true crime writer. He's come to little-town America to expose a serial murderer...Charlie Larkin. Every man she's been in contact with has befallen some disaster, even death. He falls for her, she falls for him. They catch the bad guy. The End. Except he's an idiot. He goes into his ""investigation"" _knowing_ all the answers, giving ammunition to her enemies and she falls into his arms when he suddenly grabs her and kisses her (after being really mean to her for a couple of days)."
1,From Back Cover,"Charlotte 'Charlie' Larkin believed she'd been cursed when it came to matters of the heart, especially since every man she'd ever been involved with has met with an untimely end. To add insult to injury, to-die-for true-crime write Gus Riley had come to the remote Montana town to research her for his next book!Following an attempt on Charlie's life, Gus insisted the two join forces to pursue the investigation. Charlie was unwittingly drawn to her sexy protector, but she knew she should keep her distance. Except when Gus insisted they pretend to be involved to draw out the killer, her defenses crumbled at his all-to-real advances. And being in close proximity to Gus made Charlie forget that the arrangement was supposed to be temporary - which was dangerous while the real killer lurked."
3,not too impressed,"As I reach the last third of this product in the bottle I have noticed the odor is quite unpleasant and am very hesitant to use it at all. I was not that impressed with this product, anyway. It's strange because I had a sample which I loved but the product I ordered seemed quite different from the sample. I did not feel that hydrated or as smooth as other products. I have started using argan oil instead and find that I much prefer it to this product."
5,"For my dry, dry, dry skin it is fantastic!","I've been using a product by Kiehl's that seems to be just a whole lotta oil for years now. Not that it didn't do a decent job, but to pay $60 for a bottle the same size as this one by Aubrey Organics is out of my reach these days. Besides, the cap on the bottle always, always leaked in my luggage and yes, I know I should have just put it elsewhere, but much of two bottles was lost.At any rate, this Rosa Mosqueta all natural cleanser is not at all oily feeling, but my face feels clean and soft when I'm done which is new. When I paired it with the moisturizing cream it's a system to die for. I love that the ingredients are natural, the scent is very light and not at all medicinal. Oh, and when paired with the moisturizer my face looks definitely younger than it has been. I don't suppose that the system erases lines, but maybe the healthy glow of my skin makes a difference."
3,mixed results,"first time i loved it, second time i ordered it it had some kind of sand or grit in it and it was a bother to use it, so i just stopped. will probably not buy again. trying to go without moisturizer and so far its ok. i try not to wash my face with soap. we'll see what happens in the winter."
3,Not for acne prone skin,"I liked it at first. But, after using it for a couple days, it causes me to breakout. I suspect it's the coconut cream base that's clogging my pores."
1,Allergic Reaction,"I used the product for several months with no problem. Then out of the blue I developed a severe allergy to it. My face becomes swollen red, and itchy! Just beware...."
5,a little light for my taste,"I have very sensitive skin, but it's also very dry, even in the middle of summer. This moisturizer is a little too light for my taste, but I still gave it 5 stars because you can put on many layers--and it felt wonderful. Not a trace of red on my face--I think it actually soothed and improved my skin. I still have to add a little oil on my most problematic areas (so that I don't feel dry), and it is summer. I think that this will be too light for me in the winter."
3,Alcohol Content,"12/1/2012 Update:I've been using this for a few weeks now. After I wrote the first review, I started to notice that the cleansing cream smelled like alcohol, and that my skin was more dry than usual. I understand that alcohol is useful to use as a preservative, but it's so drying. I love Aubrey Organics as a company, but I really wish they would use less alcohol in their products, or stop using it altogether.-------------------------I've never had an acne problem, but I occasionally get a few blemishes when I'm stressed out. Recently, that has been ALL THE TIME. I've also been out of my usual beauty/skincare regimen, and my skin has been suffering for it. I bought this cleanser (being a huge fan of Aubrey Organic's shampoos!), and after using it once, my skin looked visibly better. It was less dry, and this cleanser seems to have put an end to my stress breakouts. Thank you Aubrey Organics!!!"
5,Silky smooth and great for dry skin,I use this after I shower- especially if I was out at the beach soaking in the sun!This is soothing and feels great.Some folks may say it is a bit oily (only if you already have oilt skin)If youe skin is dry then it will not make your skin oily.
3,Illuminating experience!,"I have tried a number of eye cremes/lotions/potions and this is one of the only organic ones available that has been worth trying. I do think that it is moisturizing, but have not seen any change in the texture of my skin.I have light undereye wrinkling that it did not alter, though the area was soft and never irritated. It has a fairly thin consistency and you have to be sure to shake well before using to avoid a watery mess.I used approximately half the bottle before giving up on it. That did last quite some time (about 2 months),so it is long-lasting. It just did not do anything other than soften and hydrate.If you are looking for a great, organic moisturizer you will probably love it, but if you are expecting ""rejuvination"" in the appearance of wrinkles or undereye darkness, keep looking and best of luck!"
3,Very moisturizing & lasts a long time,"Even though this is a very small bottle, it does last for a long time (at least several months--you could probably buy just 2 per year). It is very moisturizing and feels nice on your skin. As far as I could tell, it did seem to make my skin feel smoother--at least while it was on. I'm not sure how well it worked on any wrinkles, but then again, I don't really have many yet. I liked it enough to buy another bottle if I get a good deal on it, but I'm not planning on buying another otherwise. I gave it 3 stars because about all it did for me was moisturizing, but I'm not a very good candidate for it's efficacy on wrinkles since I don't really have more than very fine lines. I've read other reviews on it where people were amazed how well it worked. I think if you have really dry skin it'd be quite helpful (again, I also don't have very dry skin, so it's not as helpful to me). I have tried many other Aubrey Organics products, and so far they've all been fabulous."
3,Aubrey Organics Seaware cleanser,Great product. Received all items in perfect condition and wrapped well.Received shipment late due to backorder but was given a creditbecause of this. Would order again.
4,great moisturizer,"I really enjoy this moisturizer. My skin remains moisturized and soft throughout the day. I feel good putting this on my skin since it has organic ingredients and collagen. While collagen is not the primary ingredient (that is why I gave it 4 stars) I will continue to use this product. There is not any chemicals, parabans, but simply five ingredients!"
3,It's ok,"It's an OK product, but I was not impressed with it at all. Yes, it does moisturize but that's about it. Nothing else. In fact I think it made my eyes look even worse in terms of dark circles and puffiness and fine lines. So I took the product back today. Not recommended if you are truly looking for the product that performs and not just plainly moisturizes."
4,"Okay, but coconut oil is better","I have stupidly sensitive skin. Because of this, I've found that the more ingredients a product has, the more wary I am about it, simply because I know that SOMETHING is going to bother my skin. Overall, I really like this moisturizer, but it is just a little too busy for my skin. I really recommend trying coconut oil, though. That actually works better than just about anything else I've tried. If you decide to go there, look for unrefined extra virgin coconut oil. I like Dr. bronner's."
1,Strong unpleasant odor that lasts,This product has a strong smell that is very unpleasant. The odor lingers. Maybe the one shipped to me had already gone rancid. I returned it.
4,"Great ""MOISTURIZER""","This is a great moisturizer at an affordable price. Its feels light on the face but does feel a little oily at the end of the day, not much. This is usually my back-up when I am out of NeoStrata PHA 10 face cream."
3,"Just ok, no, not a 'wonder' cream","I'm reviewing this because I've recently tried out a bunch of new moisturizers to improve my skin, and am sick of tons of reviews that tricked me by saying the cream made their skin amazing. I actually want improvement for my leftover red marks, redness, blotchiness, etc. This didn't improve anything, it just made it so my skin wasn't super dry or peeling. My most helpful thing lately has been bentonite clay masks (volcanic ash yay!) FYI."
1,"If you are guilty, you will love this","Every other sentence in this book is about race,awful white behavior, and Black suffering . If that is your idea of American history - or if you feel sufficiently guilty - you will love this book. If on the other hand you are looking for an honest travel book, you will hate this book. You need only look at the number of used books being offered (40+ right now) to see how many people have mistakenly bought this book and are anxious to dump it."
1,Don't waste your money,"First of all, the video quality on this disc is so awful, it's hard to appreciate any of the clips. Furthermore, there is very little clever or funny about these clips. A succession of unrelated clips which all end in ""God d*** it"" or ""Son of a b****"" - wow - what genius.....Sometimes blooper reels can be more entertaining than the released version. This is not one of those times. Do yourself a favor and pick something else."
1,They're actually selling this?,"I saw this on Netflix Instant Watch today. It's not even worth the airtime on your computer, much less going out of your way to spend money on a physical DVD. I don't know about the DVD version, but the streaming version had no narration, no explanation, and no credits even. It was like someone cobbled together a bunch of old bloopers and threw them onto DVD format. I've seen better blooper collections on Youtube.The bloopers themselves weren't bad, but I wouldn't pay for them."
1,You need the DVD,"This guide is pretty much useless without buying the DVD. I guess I bought the book and didn't realize you needed the DVD to use the guide. However, we are studying the book in a men's group at my church and it is EXCELLENT. gives you a whole new perspective on a parable we all grew up with and thought we knew. We didn't."
5,Very good lessons... However I will not use the seller again!,Worth your time... Highly recommend the DVD.... Just don't use the seller that I did... two weeks for me to receive it!
2,Failed after 2 months of limited use,The charging connector broke off the circuit board making it unusable after two months of limited use. I will request a refund.
2,"2-minute ""sessions""","The publisher advertises this DVD as follows:""In this six-session DVD, pastor and bestselling author Timothy Keller helps churches and small groups plumb the powerful depths of Jesus' best-known parable to explore the story's characters--the younger son, the elder son, and the Father whose lavish love exceeds what either son ever expected.""I think it would have been nice of them to be up front about the fact that only one of the six ""sessions"" is over 2 minutes long!!! I ordered this hoping it would provide adequate material for a six weeks study in our Sunday School class. The DVD will not be nearly as helpful as the advertising suggests. Be aware of this before you spend the money. Book + DVD + study guide came to around $50. In my view the $18 I paid for the DVD was not worth it."
5,Nathan,This is a life changing video. I recommend this to be seen by everyone!!! I have watched this over and over again and I am moved by it each time.
3,Never compelling,"This major studio sci-fi horror film has the feel of an indie, and it starts as a routine mystery story before morphing into a much darker tale about a blindness epidemic. The makers try to make a metaphor out of it for how and why blindness changes things in big and little ways and how humans are all one etc etc. I was never very involved in the tale, though, and actually paused it repeatedly over two days before I could get through it. Not a good sign. Photography tricks throughout to make the viewer feel blind get annoying quickly."
1,Robbed Blind By This Awful Movie!,"Apparently the actors in this movie were hard up for a paycheck and had no concern over the quality of the script. This is one of the DUMBEST movies I have ever seen. What a waste of time, talent, and money (mine). The movie is filmed in a dark grayish cast, which is annoying. The editing is horrible.I want a refund from my $1.49 rental fee. What a joke!!!!!!!!!"
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever Made,This is one of the worst movies ever made. It starts off good and then it quickly falls apart and turns into a horrible movie that you wished you never saw. I thought that I would give this movie a chance and now I truly regret it. I threw away almost $20 on this trash.
4,Realistic...,"Society could break down in any number of ways, not all of which have yet found their way into the movies. The zombie, the alien, and the world war scenerios are but a few. Blindness offers a remarkably fresh perspective from which to view the extreme frailty and ruthlessness of the human animal.Let it simply be said that this film is very good. Blindness is an intelligent and frightening tale, most effective because of the restraint and realism employed. Far more than entertainment, this is a statement on the very fabric of our species and how little it takes to tear it apart.All involved do well to elevate Blindness to stunning success, high above the thousands of films that focus only on the mundane. Each of the principle actors play especially unique roles, and the overall direction feels distinct and powerful. Best of all, this movie makes the audience experience the situation, not merely view it."
4,Brutal but Fascinating,"If you are looking for a sci-fi or horror type film, some escapist fun, then this is not the movie for you. If you are looking for a well directed, well acted, stylish film that examines the foibles of the human condition, you will love this. The starkness of the cinematography, the multi-cultural cast, and an excellent screenplay make this an excellent character study and observation on what man can do to man when put in extreme circumstances. It is sometimes brutal to watch, but I guarantee you'll come out of it thinking long and hard about what you just witnessed."
1,This movie was nonsense,"The action was good. The slightly off humor, and rapid changes between action and speech were also good. So what went wrong?As soon as the movie got out of the hospital environment they were in, everything goes quickly down hill. I can't even remember the number of ways me and my friends heckled the film. This movie goes wack faster than Tom Cruise when given an opportunity to hop on Ophrah's couch. I wish I could remember the innumerable things specifically that brought this movie down. I wanted to watch it, I wanted to like it, and by the end I wanted to die."
1,Worst Movie Ever Bar None,"This was easily the worst movie I have ever seen. The story and acting is laugh out loud ridiculous. The plot is a joke. I am not going to type in a long winded review of the plot. I am just warning you, this is two hours of your life you will never get back, disregard this warning at your own peril."
2,Anarchy of the Blind,"Typical and predictable behavior of the oppressor and oppressed. No really, you could see what was coming in a not so original premise for a lousy movie. As the conditions degraded and the paranoia got worse, the story became laborious. The usual scumbag ""king of the hill"" surfaces its ugly head to turn the little community into an anarchy unto itself.A cross between ""Animal Farm"" and ""Lord Of The Flies?"""
3,A bit disappointed,"Let me preface this by saying that I have not read the book.I was fascinated at the premise of people suddenly going blind although it did bother me that instead of stopping to help, drivers yelled at the poor guy. And why the heck would these people be shuffled off to an old prison intead of hospital? I have a lot more why's but most have already been covered by other reviewers. What annoyed me the most was we never knew why people were going blind, and why Juliane Moore's character did NOT go blind. It was like...HUH?One would think that the screen writer and whomever else involved, would take into consideration that most people will not have read the book (I didn't even know there was a book) and create a film that made more sense to us.That said, now that I know there is a book, I'll be picking it up so get a better understanding of the story."
2,Did not like it.,"I thought the movie was depressing and violent. There were too many details left out. The ending was unclear, as well."
1,Waste of Potential,"Once upon a time, there was a book and later a movie called ""Day of the Triffids"". In the book (and I assume the movie), people go blind while watching comets at night. Those that didn't see the comets, kept their sight. As a result, the whole world is thrown into chaos. ""Blindness"" is similar to ""Day of the Triffids"" except there are no triffids and the blindness is more gradual. The world has time to attempt a cure. Most of the movie deals with a group of people thrown into a quarantine (one of which still had their eyesight) and the resulting deteriorating conditions. None of the characters had any appeal. The plot was exceedingly slow at times and unnecessarily brutal at other times (as alluded to in other reviews). Overall, I had high hopes for the movie and it failed across the board. I cannot recommend the movie to anyone."
1,Blindness --- what a waste of time !!!,"I knew before watching it that it was an odd type of movie, but still I wanted to see it. All I have to say is OH MY GOD, what a waste of time. There's no plot besides the fact that the whole town goes blind, that's it !!! no one is trying to find a solution... there's no story to it. Of course, to make it ""look"" like a movie, they had to throw in things like the crazy behaviour one would expect under these circumstances, but it's pathetic! I couldn't wait for it to be over, my husband and I kept looking at each other and laughing... I don't understand why actors such as Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Gael García Bernal and Danny Glover would want to make a film like this. Unbelievable, not worth even a rental!"
2,Terrible,"This movie is awful. The plot is paper thin. Characters do not react to situations the way any normal person would. Tons of graphic images and situations are added just for shock value. Several things happen in the movie that mean to be serious but are so far from normal that you will laugh. One scene shows the main character catching her husband with another woman. Instead of confronting them she just tells the woman that she can still see. The fact that her husband was unfaithful is never mentioned again. Plus, the ending totally nullifies the entire premise of the movie.Do not expect a gripping sci-fi/drama in the vein of 28 Days Later. This movie seems more like a film school students concept. Bright light blume effects make up most of the camera work.Do not expect a major plot twist or some gripping prologue to why everyone in the world is going blind. They just are.Do not buy, Do not rent. Stay away."
2,Flails; goes nowhere; good actors wasted,"I gave this a couple of stars just for Ruffalo and Moore, and maybe McKellar. Otherwise, the movie itself flails and stumbles around much like a person who has just lost his or her sight, goes nowhere, never reveals what caused the infection or where the research is going, does not have a satisfying ending, and wastes the talented Sandra Oh by giving her less than a minute of screen time. Also, the fancy camera work detracts from the story rather than adds to it.I have a strong feeling that the book is much better."
5,THESE GIRL'S CAN ROCK,"WHEN I 1ST HEARD OF KITTIE I HEARD THAT SONG ""BRACKISH"" OFF THEIR 1ST ALBUM, SO I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT THE ALBUM ""SPIT"" AND I LOVE IT, THEN WHEN THIS ALBUM CAME OUT I WENT AND GOT IT AND I LOVE IT ALSO THESE GIRLS CAN ROCK WITH THE BEST OF EM"
1,Spit Low Down Album Piece Of ....,"Oracle was weak compared to Spit. Morgan's change in her scream really ruined the CD, as the hissing got repetative. Her singing, however, is the only reason i considered listening it the whole way through. The hissing is extremly annoying, and she uses it in all of the wrong spots. Not only is oracle weaker, but it is slower than spit to. Intense songs like ""spit"" ""brackish"" or ""raven"" blew away supposivly intense songs like ""mouthful of poison"" and ""no name"" however, i must say the What Ive Always Wanted and Mouthful Of Poison were the only decent songs. If u liked spit, ull hate this, hate spit, ull like this. This CD was poorly written, and i do NOT reccomend it"
1,Pretty big shame...,It's too bad that angry teenage girls that want to vent out their anger have such few all female bands to turn to as their ambassadors. I would love for the record industry to sign some all female bands with ACTUAL TALENT. Instead of Babes in Toyland we have bands like Kittie and The Donnas putting out lame records with little or no thought or talent put into them. Any talented all female bands out there looking to get their big break should take note from bands like Kittie. The standard has been lowered once again...Make your move.
1,dissapointed...,"ok, i bought this cd thinking it would be better than the last one, i hadnt heard any of it, but i thought ""its kittie, it HAS to be good."" when i started listening to it i wanted to return it. ""spit"" was one of the best cd's ever, and this was very different from spit. the lyrics didnt make much sense, and even if they did you wouldnt be able to understand them anyway, it just sounds like screaming with stuff smashing in the background. i started to wonder why it was so bad. i think Fallon must have contributed to the group a lot, and now that they dont have her they lost some of their group. and what really makes me angry, is they had a GUY fill in for fallon. they dont really mention him, but still, the whole thing about kittie was that they were an ALL girl group. i was very disapointed, and wish it was better. i think i'll just stick to spit. but hey, maybe youll like it."
1,These Women Are Sooooooooooo Hardcore.,"Oh my God,this is the most hardcore CD I have ever heard.It just rawks man.I mean,this CD is so heavy,it is impossible to pick it up.So,if you are into true hardcore music such as Spice Girls,Britney Spears,and Dream,You will just die for Kittie.Kittie really are not as heavy as Spice Girls,Britney,and Dream,but man they come awfully close.Okay,peace I'm out."
5,ORACLE BY KITTIE,"When I first heard of Kittie, and listened to the first track 'Spit' on their Spit album, I was kind of scared of thembecause they were so dark....How dumb was I! I bought their second album, Oracle, around xmasand it was the first CD I listened to on Christmas day.It's a great CD. Favorite songs:OracleMouthful Of PoisionIn WinterRun Like HellPainWolvesWhat I Always WantedSafePink LemonadeThe songs ""Severed"" and ""No Name"" are good, but not as good as the others."
4,A little beyond expectation,"This is my first Kittie album I bought (thought it would be Spit...). The songs I liked was ""What I've Always Wanted"", ""Wolves"", and ""Safe"". All of the tracks sound so distorted and rough, but that's what gives Kittie the 'energy'. What I really liked about this album was the variety of speed. Songs like ""What I've Always Wanted"" is a medium-paced song with slow vocal (both roaring and whining), and ""Pink Lemonade"" is a song with slow everything. I mean it's THAT slow. A song that can take only 2 minutes to sing takes 10 minutes instead. It also has a cover of the song ""Run Like Hell"" by Pink Floyd (which sounds ok).What I didn't like about this album is that it doesn't have any fast songs. And the riffs sound pretty much the same. They sould've used a variety of effects to create some different sounding songs (like LB). Also, Morgan is over-using her ability to 'roar'. She should 'whine' some more. And not all songs are good...A 4/5..."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"I have had this CD for a grand total of two hours and I gotta admit, it's really good. I didn't think that it could be good, but then again, I loved the first album. I really can't say that I have a fave one right now...oh wait. Yes I can. Run Like Hell is my fave track on there. I'll let you know more when I have it for longer."
1,Bad Kittie!,"I got it. You can growl. Yes, I can hear it. That doesn't mean you have to make an entire album out of it. The rest of Kittie's albums are much more coherent than this one. I would classify this as death metal, and when it comes to death metal...chicks and guys sound the same :("
4,A step up for Kittie,"""Oracle"" is a great album. It shows how the band has become more mature and is more than just a band blending in with whatever fad is popular in music. A step up from ""Spit"" in many ways, Morgan's hardcore vocals are more controlled than on ""spit"", there is more of a variety of different sound than Kittie's previous release, and the departure of Fallon Bowman only helped more because this album didn't contain her poor vocals which was a large flaw on ""Spit"". Songs like Oracle give the hardcore sound that made Kittie famous while tracks like ""Safe"",""What I always Wanted"", and the cover to Pink Floyd's ""Run Like Hell"" show that the band is truly talented and more versatile than most metal bands. I think Kittie have definently made a name for themselves."
3,Kittie,"Alright this cd is good, i like it WAY better than spit, spit was just to slow for me i love how her voice is a lot better in this, but i only give it 3 stars becuz there alright"
4,Not Bad,"I hate the death metal stuffo n here, it's not even real death metal, it's just gutteral moosh and noise! They do a few good songs on here, Run LIke Hell is an okay cover, but come on! It's very hard to cover a Floyd song! What I Always Wanted and In Winter are the best only because she doesn't sound like she wants to kick my ass but instead annoys me. For chick rock and beautiful vocals (guy or girl) it doesn't matter, Morgan can sing! She really needs to stick to it, i hope she does. I recommend Jack Off Jill instead, i only bought Kittie cause our crappy record stores never have anything. Jessika in jack Off Jill is more beautiful in terms of vocal talent, but this is an okay album, buy it if you like beautiful possibly poetic nu metal, and no, nu metal is not a bad thing, i like it."
3,"Good,but...","I am a big fan of Kittie, i love them. They are a great band with talent. This is definitley not their best piece of work, but i still enjoy this CD. It has some fabulous songs like ""Mouthful of Poison"" and ""In Winter"" (my 2 favorites). And this CD has some other very good songs like ""Run like Hell, ""What i always wanted"", ""Safe"" and ""Pink Lemonade"". The rest of the songs are okay, which brought this CD down. The other songs kind of sound the same and it gets boring. ""Spit"" and ""Until the End"" are the best albums they've made. ""Paperdoll EP"" is a very good CD as well. I don't think this is a bad CD, it just could have been a lot better"
4,Heavy,"From the first track to the last, all this band exemplifies is heavy, heart-grinding metal. Morgan Landers' voice is unreal and so so powerful, she definitely has the power (in her voice) to knock the socks off any would-be hater.In Winter is probably my favorite song on the album, the endin will grab you by the *ahem* throat ;)"
2,masochisitic,"It's heavy music, but not the good kind.This is the kind where they scream like they were being murdered for 45 minutes, with uninspired simplistic chord accompaniment.They even manage to butcher a song by Pink Floyd, which is unforgivable.To be honest, i enjoyed this a lot back in the days when i used to cut myself with a blade for fun. Three weeks later i grew out of that habit, and i also grew out of this album. Interesting.All in all, these girls prove that women belong in the kitchen. ;-)(just kidding about that last comment)"
5,oh yes!!!!!! baby!!!,"this is the only good piece of work released by kittie. meyowwwwwif i would of known sooner that they did, run like hell, and all i ever wanted i would of jerked off to them sooner. and for the most part the albums kicks, though they try to overdo it at times, they rock baby oh yeah sugar!!!!. so um, put out some new stuff. and good stuff. you light my balls a blazing fire. oh yeah. just kidding. but come on huckle yucks. or i'll cry and then kill myself."
2,Slipknot with girls?,"That's basically what they sound like. Which is a pity because when the lead singer actually sings properly - instead of screaming as though she's having a particularly painful orgasm - she's actually got a pretty good voice. Sorry but this is certainly not goth, it's death metal. For goth, check out:H.I.MJack of JillMarilyn Manson*Black Sabbath(*For those who say Manson isn't goth, have a listen to the Holy Wood album)"
2,"great vocals, weak songs","I just recieved and listened to this album, and I'm pretty disappointed in it. It's a shame because both the singing and screaming vocals are great, but the music itself is just plain boring. This is all just mid-tempo sludge, heaviness for the sake of being heavy, (...). Nothing even remotely interesting or memorable.The Kittie Songs you hear on the radio are there for a reason.....That's the BEST they have to offer. It's a shame. I hope the next time out they'll learn how to write better ""songs""."
3,Is Kittie's Purrrrr Too Loud?,"Recently i got this album and i have mixed feelings. It has good songs but it's too much screaming! I wish they did some more songs like Charolette. On the + side though it is really creepy, which i like! all in all I give cd a ""C"" but i gave their 1st album a ""B+"""
2,Pretty Dodgy,"After their debut album Spit I eagerly anticipated their second effort ""Oracle"" however after listening to it I must say it was a disappointment. The songs all sound the same, with similar guitar work and screaming lyrics that all sound the same. This album is a definite down turn from an originally great band. Hopefully they can remedy the faults in their next attempt and bring them back to the brillance of their first album. Don't bother with this album unless you are a fanatic, and even then you will probably still be disappointed"
4,KiTTiE..the best band ever,"This is a great CD. Not as good as ""Spit"", but still good. My favorite's are probaly ""mouthful of poison"" and ""in winter"". ""in winter"", ""safe"",and ""pink lemonade"" Morgan shows her beautiful singing. The rest of the tracks, Morgan shows us her harcore screaming. Talena is a great bass player. And Mercedes plays those head-bainging drums, which is amazing. This is a great CD, get it"
4,"Good, but Spit was better.","I'm really glad that Kittie produced another album, but I think that Spit had much better songs. There was too much screaming I thought. I think the best songs that Kittie writes includes faster paced music, Morgan singing in her pretty voice and then the chorus is hard as hell, like ""Charlotte"", ""Brackish"", ""Suck"". ""In Winter"" seemed to be the only like that on this CD."
2,Avoid this one....,"Well, after much anticipation for the new release from KITTIE, all I can say is ""What the hell happened?"". I've been reading endless reviews saying how this was MILES ahead of their debut, how they've evolved as a band, etc., but this is just a big disappointment. First up, lets discuss the vocals. They are 90% Death Metal. If this is your thing, you may be able to look past this. (I hate Death Metal Vocals) Every once in a while the lead singer breaks the monotony, with clear vocals, but its not enough. Second: the songwriting is simply NOT VERY GOOD. Slow, sludgy, downtuned riffs, with no groove, imagination or power. BORING! There are about 3 MARGINALLY good songs here. Third: The production is weak. The drums are almost INVISIBLE, and the guitars sound like MUD! I had hopes for these gals, but it looks like they are trying too hard to prove how ""heavy"" they are. This one is getting sold back to the record shop. Better luck next time, KITTIES."
1,More of the same,"Kittie recently came back on the radar with another release, and i was talking to someone about them, and he said he had all of their cd's, so he let me listen to them while i was in the lab working. apparently, two of the members left, and all that's left is the two sisters, and i don't know what happened in the four years since i bought their debut album, Spit. Spit was repetitive, but at least they sang, instead of trying to scream like some cheap death-metal knockoff. the drumlines which i enjoyed in Spit have been dumbed down as well, and are pretty much percussive mirrors of the music itself, rather than the counterlines that they had earlier. perhaps other people will like them, but after four years, i find Kittie to be a major disappointment."
4,From one friend to another,"I'm not a metal fan, not at all. I can't say I have an extensive knowledge of the bands that make up the genre, so maybe I am just ignorant. But anyway, I saw one of Kittie's videos on mtv2, and I just thought, wow that was excellent. The lead singers vocals are beautiful, and the combination of that and so-called ""death metal"" is very cool. Their instrumentation is quite excellent, especially the drums, which really pump me up for some reason. I bought this release on a whim, because I couldn't get the video out of my head, I needed more. The album is definitely worth buying, it's hard, very hard, but (I should know their names but I don't) the lead singer puts some purely angelic passages throughout, it's different from all of the music I usually listen to and I recommend it wholeheartedly."
2,Not Really As good as Spit,"I got both of Kittie's Cds for Christmas and after lisening to both virtually all the way through I fell in love with Spit (they're debut album) and only really liked two songs I really liked off the album where Run Like Hell and What I Always Wanted otherwise, it's just a bunch a screaming girls. They really needed Fallon Bowman or another bassist otherwise this isn't worth getting. Morgan or Talena's voice (I don't know which one screams)gives me a headache. The last song on the album is extremaly annoying to sit through because it's about 10 minutes last words: Buy Spit instead unless you want a headache."
1,Great To Gag,"Kittie's debut CD, 'Spit', got me hooked, so of course, when I saw their new CD, I was thrilled. Until I listened to it. Much in contrast to 'Spit', the CD is very unoriginal and contains just a lot of strange heavy metal screams. I only enjoyed one song on this album. Save your money, maybe their junior CD will be better."
1,"MISLABELED, image incorrect/product description WRONG","I needed Pimpinella anisum, which is what the picture shows, and which is what is included in the description as the botanical name---HOWEVER, the product received says Illicum Verum, which is STAR ANISE and something different. I see now there is another place in the ""description"" that lists illicum verum, so the descriptions are incorrect. I sent feedback to the seller and they have refunded me the entire price including shipppng and sent an apology, have indicated they are investigating what went wrong. I appreciate that."
4,The Evolution of Spanish,"This book is useful to anyone wishing to understand better the process by which Latin became Spanish. Even if it's a technical subject, the style is informal and acessible. This is an introduction, and a pretty good one."
1,Terrible,"If you are thinking of buying this DVD, don't. The audio is terrible. Sometimes the background music (Jewel) is the same volume as the person speaking. Then, the volume of the person speaking will fade nearly all the way. The DVD doesn't cover anything new in the Tattoo world and seems to be a badly produced DVD about a whole lot of nothing really. The interviews are pointless and poorly conducted."
4,John W,Not sure how much better it is sound wise than other monster cables but definitely more secure and feels much sturdier.
5,A father overcame his own fear with this book,"My wife is shortly planning to give birth naturally, and believes strongly in mind-body connection. It seems the ""only"" father books out there are the humorous kind that ridicule the process. I have been full of anxiety about the birth, but this book helped me see that it is a natural process, and has relieved my own fears. I also believe the less anxious I am, the less stressed my wife will be. I am an amateur actor, and know a bit about relaxation techniques, so I recognize the approach and know how good it can be for one's body. This book also gives the father/partner good ideas for mental imagery techniques to use both before and during the birth."
5,An essential part of natural childbirth preparation,"As a mother who has given birth naturally three times, I couldn't have done it without preparing myself mentally. Mind over labor will guide you to your inner strength that is so powerful and empowering that it will not only soothe you better than any drug, but will untap the powers available to you that you can use during other physical and mental times of stress. As a certified nurse midwife, I always recommend this book to anyone who is expecting whether they plan on using drugs or not. Easy to read, and can be used as a guide by rereading certain chapters and phrases while in labor."
3,Good relaxation tips but narrow-minded,"I found this book to be helpful in some ways, but the obvious bias against hospitals/doctors was a little annoying. I would say if you're looking for some relaxation techniques, you'll probably enjoy this book, but my advice would be to look for something with a little more open-mindedness."
3,Disappointing,"While the subject matter and point of Jones' book are both excellent, the writing is more like an academic dissertation riddled with quotes from ""experts"". I felt as if he was unsure of his beliefs, and needed to back them up with other people's endorsements.I do like some of the exercises of mental visualization; but I would highly recommend ""Birthing From Within"" as a more practical guide (clear, concise exercises to practice) & more accessible read."
1,Pass on this one,"I did not find this book at all helpful for preparing for natural childbirth. I read it before the birth of my first child. The only thing that had any application for me during actual labor was the information on how fear can slow and even stop labor. The imagery ideas and ""labor can be enjoyable and even orgasmic"" philosophy were impractical. The author implies that labor can and should be perfectly enjoyable for every woman. The La Maze class I took before the birth of my second child was much more helpful."
1,What a horrible book!,"I was completely comfortable with all aspects of my labor UNTIL I read this book! It purposely tries to make you fearful and then tells you not to be afraid. The author completely destroys your comfortable state of mind by making up a bunch of terrible things that can happen or awful ways you could feel in order to "" make you feel better"" so that you appreciate the book. Its sick! If you feel comfortable at all about what you might go through in labor DONT read this book. By the way I had my son naturally, at home, in a tub of water, with a midwife and no pain killers, It was wonderful and I used NOTHING from this book, which our labor teacher had us read. You don't need this book. You need to trust your body."
4,"Publishers Weekly - Reed Business Info,, Inc Get ReaL !!","Publishers Weekly - Reed Business Information, Inc (see their review above) provides us with a classic example of how smoothly MISinformation can float out as authoritarian knowledge.Whoever wrote the Publishers Weekly review failed to do the homework necessary to displace from their brain a very commonly-held belief: that childbirth out-of-hospital is not as safe as childbirth in-hospital. Now, that review is dated...but there was ample evidence then...and even more now. Overwhelming evidence. So there is no excuse !Go do the homework and discover the truth !"
5,by far my favorite childbirth book-- pre delivery,"I love this book. It totally reminded me how to clam and relax myself, and not be a freaked out anxiety ball. I will let you know if it's still my favorite after the baby is born! :)"
1,Money back for Kindle edtition,Good book. The tables and check lists are very useful - at least I think so. Unfortunately they are unreadable in the Kindle edition. In addition the Index does not work! --> I want my money back.
4,PROCESS SELLING,Excellent book to give you a method to map your progress in the selling experience. Anyone who seems lost this is a great tool to get back on track.
4,Moving from Selling Products to Satisfying Customers,"I have used this book and its tools in 2 companies I have worked with and I think the techniques and practices that it describes are very useful as part of an overall sales transformation.It is well-written, concise and to the point. The language used will (I believe) appeal to sales people who are struggling to get a very deep connection with their customer issues. Whilst many senior, experienced sales people may already use and recognise some of the techniques used the fact that this book gives tools and techniques that can be used organisation-wide is a great help.Now its over to you to use it ..."
5,Great first chapter book!,"I purchased both Book 1 & Book 2 for my almost 5 year old who loves space. He loves them! We read 1 chapter each night at bed time, and then the next night we talk about what happened in the previous chapter before we go one - he always surprises me whith how much he remembers. I think the series is great - book 2 ends with ""the voyage continues..."" - I can't wait for the next one to come out!"
3,Interesting work....,"Started being really pessimistic. First two-three episodes made an impression of a weak, crime and some time wrong values -promoting series. Continued with the series to see what's going to happen. Well, it is an easy watch. Dialogs are not bad, can't say good cos pretty often they ""overslang"". Seemed like characters were stuck in their teens. Though it did improve towards the end. Acting is good. Some characters are way better that professional actors. Cinematography is quite original but there are some annoying overuse of closeup shots and shots ""upwards"" - it is ok couple of times, but not all the time. Scenery footage is good though. Plot is average. As mentioned before, values are brought in with close tie to crime, several places promote lying and disrespect. 3 out of 5."
5,Christmas present,"My girlfriend has always asked for a tri-color gold bracelet which has proven incredibly difficult to find in retail stores. This bracelet is more delicate than the picture may suggest, but it definitely made her eyes light up."
4,"not bad, needed a bit of modification","I thought it was a torch, but it's only a heat gun, so I removed the little tin shroud and then it blew a nice controlled flame. Comes with a refillable, also takes those cheap lighters if you rip out the wheel and flint. But as with all of them, it quits sparking in a few months."
4,This is a one of a kind book with rooms for improvement.,"This is probably the first book dedicated to this subject. For this reason it deserves a four star rating. It is written in a way that is very appropriate for development managers and users of Web GIS systems. It does not require a lot of technological know-how. It also has a lot of web links that serve the purpose of intruducing people to the idea of GIS online.However, this book is not very suitable for the technicians who actually make the web GIS. It does not have enough discussion on the related programming issues, namely, Java and Markup Languages. Its discussion on over-all system planning is also quite superficial from a programmer's point of view. Issues like how to make web GIS co-exists with other database systems (accounting, inventory control, etc.) are not discussed."
5,Definately a band to watch!,"First time I saw Matt Mays and El Torpedo was over a year ago at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto. They're not really my style of music, but when they played a show recently with songs from this album, I was hooked. They've gotten so much attention and rave reviews recently and they totally deserve every bit of it! From start to finish this is one of the best CD's I've ever heard, definitely my favourite Canadian band right now. If you can, try and see these guys live. And they are also really nice in person.First single Cocaine Cowgirl is amazing, and other great tracks are St. George's Lane, What Are We Gonna Do Come the Month of September, and On The Hood.Highly recommend this CD!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Cool New Sound,"Wow, a band with such an original sound doesn't come by often enough. The first song that I heard from Matt Mays & El Torpedo was ""City of Lakes"". I liked it, but I didn't know the name of the band who sang it. A few months later, I heard ""Cocaine Cowgirl"" and loved it. I later found out that both songs were from the same artist."
2,Thank g0d for Cancon regulations...,"Matt Mayes and El Torpedo is probably the most overrated band on the Canadian music scene right now. I know so many people who are such huge fans of this band, and I can't figure out why anybody would want to listen to these guys because their music is so dull. Matt Mayes and El Torpedo is a band that you can just take their record and throw it in the garbage.There is only one reason why this band is popular and that's because of the Canadian content regulations the government imposed on the Canadian media back in the '70s. Matt Mays is one of those artists who gets played to death on Canadian radio, not for his talent, but to help the radio station meet its ""35% Canadian content"" requirements. Matt, all I can say to you is be thankful you come from a country where local music is mandatory, otherwise your career in music would have gone nowhere."
5,beautiful,"This item is a thing of beauty, made to enhance the wine drinking experience to the fullest."
2,Dainty,When I recived this I was disappointed to see that it is quite small. I guess I should have known that from the fact it is 1-liter but it appears much smaller than most decanters I have used. Also there was a bubble in the glass. I sent it back so I don't know how it actually works.
5,perfect,Holds printed directions as well as a folded map. Kept paper dry in a light rain & magnets hung tight at highway speeds. Highly recommend.
3,Not sure...,I bought this for my very dry course hair. I tried adding it at the end of my hair regime but it makes the hair courser and frizzier.
5,I Confirm It!,"This product certainly makes my curls soft and more pronounced. I'm ordering more today! For me, it's a 5 star product."
2,B'Leave In Review,"I have always purchased my deva curl products at the salon. I have used B'leave in for years and it has been terrific. When I purchased it online, it isn't at all the same as the same product in the salon. It is watery and does not condition as well as the salon bought product. This is very disappointing."
1,Ick!,"I love every Deva product that I have tried... except for this! I don't know if it was my particular B'Leave in bottle or if it's all of them, but mine was clumpy, as if it was rancid or cheaply made! In addition it didn't do any favors for my hair. I still use No-Poo, one condition, An-Gel, and set it free daily, but I threw out my B'Leave in and will not buy it again. It is possible that my hair is too thin to need this product. But what about the clumps?"
1,Disappointed,"This line of product came highly recommended from a friend, and I have to say, I'm very disappointed. Maybe I'm just used to using natural hair products, but they all smell and feel too 'chemically' to me. I thought the product line was supposed to provide extra moisture for your curls. My hair has never been so dry. Now I need to go get all my freshly-split ends cut off, and I'm trying to grow out my hair! I'm going back to my old products and giving these to my friend. Money wasted."
2,I want to like Deva but they just don't work for me,I love the ethos of this company. I love how Curl Power they and I wanted to transition into a completely natural product line. I gave the whole line the old college try and it just wasn't for me. I am a solid 3B and i found that this made my hair really greasy looking even though it didn't feel greasy to the touch. In fact the ends felt dry. I tried every possible combination or product and amount and it just wasn't working. for the people I have seen this product work really well on is girls with wavy hair that want to work it into curl. then it is great but if you already have big curls it is just too heavy and pulls it down.
4,Love it!,"I used to straighten out my fine curly hair every day - never able to make peace with my curls because they were dry and unruly. I've been using DevaCurl products for about 6 months, and B'Leave-In is a key part of the process that works for me. I use it on WET hair straight out of the shower, before using Arc-Angell. I did have to play with the line a little before my hair figured out how to respond to it, but now I can say I've never loved my curls this much in my life. If your hair is dry, B'Leave-In will make the difference without weighing down. But I think you really have to use it with the rest of the line, or it won't make much sense..."
4,The plot thickens,"The series appears to reach a climax here. Sadly, although I have read it twice, it has been a couple of years and I don't remember what my first impression was."
1,Who Reads This Crap?,"O.K. Obviously I read half of this book, and then I threw it back to the library...but really who reads this crap. Some semi-illiterate gospel-spouting escapist rednecks...I mean, all copies of this pseudo-biblical garbage should be flushed or trashed. If anything the authors of this book are going to hell,capitalizing off the Old and New Testament, and patting it off too sound like trite, repulsive crap!...BLASPHEMY!"
3,Babylon Rising:The Europa Conspiracy,"My brother let me borrow his copy of this book. He has really enjoyed the series. I will go back and read 1 & 2. However, I have to agree with a review from February that I was confused about the fate of one of the characters. During one scene Bingham had survived an earthquake, but Murphy was later lamenting his death. I actually went back and read a couple of times to see if I had missed something. I hadn't. This must have been some type of editing error. I enjoyed reading this tale anyway. It is a Christian novel, so I expect the message of salvation to be included. I hope that the type of error I found in this book won't be in the others."
2,You might want to skip this one...,"Europa Conspiracy is, first and foremost, nowhere near as fast-paced as Babylon Rising or even The Secret on Ararat. I was terminally disappointed with this installment from beginning to end. Even as a Christian woman, I found it too preachy, and I felt as if Tim LaHaye ""dumbed down"" a lot of the Biblical and historical references/explanations in hopes of attracting a more diverse age group. It also seemed as if he was including very adolescent-sounding dialogue and these bad explanations as fillers to make the book longer, while leaving out the action that caught my attention in the first two books of the series. At this point, the only reason I will continue reading this series is because of the cliffhanger at the end of the novel."
1,"So, So","Having read the first two in the series, I had hoped the author would learn how to write an ending. Each of the books had about the same type of ending. Good build-up until the end. It seems like he was trying to finish the book so he could start writing the next book. The book was on a rise to the climax and then just died out at the end. I am really not inclined to purchase nor read the next one due to the standards of the books so far."
3,So-so and WHAT?,"This was a blatant commercial product gimmick with such an inconclusive ending. Yes, y'all, it really was preachy -- maybe because things were repeated. What action it had was fun, though. That's the say something nice and I will have to keep reading.What happened at the almost-end? They wouldn't have the camera if it had not been retrieved, right? The poor man's wife and kids really needed him home, right? So why were they mourning him at the end?There were other little inconsistencies, but they probably weren't noticed by people who do speed reading: Drinking Turkish coffee out of a glass (it's a custom, isn't it?) and then carefully setting the cup down in the saucer. Suddenly standing up before the professor had cleared off a chair as a place for Murphy to sit."
2,Disapointing,"I read all of the Left behind series including the two prequels, and decided to read this series while waiting on the final prequel. I liked the first two books, and even this one until there is the problem with Bingman, or is it Bingham, who survived, and then was said to have died. Tim you said you were more excited about this series than any other, well it dosen't show in this sloppy edition. Somebody please read the next book before it goes to the printer, and I will read it also. Thanks"
2,A decent read,I am not a huge Christian fiction fan but this is a decent read. Kind of a lighter more enjoyable time.
3,Let Down,I was disapointed by this book. It contains too much religion and not enough detailed action and suspense. It didn't measure up to the first two books.
5,Good LISTENING!,I've read a few reviews on a few sites...hey the ONLY thing I found bad about this book was one scene. Since when does a Professor...'forget' papers or his own brief case? That scene threw me for a loop. Outside of that...this is going along pretty good...just want to know WHEN IS THE NEXT BOOK COMING OUT??Ending on a cliff-hanger?? No info on the next book to be found??ARRRRRRRRRRgh...but seriously...really well written.
2,What a disappointment,"I have been a fan of Tim LaHaye's for a long time now, and eagerly started reading this new Babylon Rising series. I loved the first book, the second was not nearly as meaty, and this one is even less so. It seemed it was quickly written, and very much on a surface level. And the worst part was when they did not even catch a huge error in the storyline...there was a character that almost died. They were all so happy he did not die, then all of a sudden, Micheal was talking about what a shame his death was...what is up with that?? For the price I paid, that was just unacceptable, and totally sloppy. I do not like to think money is behind the quick writing, but...hmmm... The only good parts were the stories from the Bible itself...those were great!"
1,A Disappointment!,"Like many others, I am very disappointed in this book. The storyline seems rushed, and the dialogue is ponderous. I found myself skipping pages of text obviously fabricated to inform the reader of some interesting facts presented in very boring ways. The conversations between Murphy and Bingham are the worst; suddenly Bingham seems unclear about his profession and his own faith. I missed the usual depth of biblical prophecy and scholarship that I enjoy the most in LaHaye's work. The best parts of the book are the Daniel flashbacks, but even they seem to be jumbled at times. And it seemed pretty clear to me that Isis became a Christian in the last book, but in this one she's still undecided. The last straw for me was the sketchy fate of Bingham--did he miraculously survive with the evidence of their find (for the first time in the series) and fly home to his family, or was he killed? What's going on here, Tim?"
2,Kind of a let down,"This book was kind of a let down for me. To me, Tim came off VERY preachy in this book. When you mix that together with the typos and screw ups (one chapter his associate escapes death, the next he is talking about his associates death being hard to get over), it just kind of makes me wish I didn't waste the time reading it. I was kind of surprised because the other two books were so good....oh well, guess I'll read the DaVinci code....."
4,"A very informative, practical guide for writers.",I was very impressed with the way it used real-life experiences to teach its lessons. It gives you the feeling that it is very possible to get an article written and published. The information I absorbed from it was extremely helpful in starting me on to future success. It is a must for any writer (especially the beginner).
2,Don't be fooled by the subtitle!,".When I saw this book and read the dustjacket notes I assumed it would be what the title suggested: a ""narrative"" history of the Great Depression, told primarily through the experiences of persons who lived through it.I was sorely disappointed.Make no mistake -- the book contains a wealth of well-researched data quite valuable to the study of the depression, but written like a college text, with appropriate footnotes, instead of as a literary exercise such as David McCullough's TRUMAN.Nothing wrong with that, but the book should be marketed and reviewed as an academic effort rather than as a ""narrative history."""
2,"Superficial, Intellectually Lightweight Depression Review","One will not learn the cause of the Great Depression from Watkin's book (for that read ""Creature from Jekyll Island"" by G. Edward Griffin) or learn of the Wall Street greed factor (for that read Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear"") that contributed so much to the Depression's birth. This IS a rather interesting collection of anecdotes/stories that vividly paint how the Depression was, just don't pay full price or you'll regret it.Unfortunately, we are headed for another Depression this decade as the crushing amounts of personal/corporate/government debtruin the employment and investment scenes."
4,A FAMILY CLASSIC!!!!!!!,I saw this movie on tv years ago and fell in love with it. This movie introduce me to Carl Malden. It is a comedy and very much for the family. I waited for this movie to be released on dvd and bought my copy immediately. Roddy Mcdowall was superb as the butler!!!!!!!!
4,Show Dog is a fun read!,"Ed is the kind of dog that only his family can understand and appreciate. They are so amazed by his wonderful talents that they enter him in the county fair dog show. Surely Ed will win. Why not? By being himself, he certainly will win the hearts of all who see him...especially a fluffy female pedigree.The bright and fun illustrations and fun humor are entertaining for both children and their reading mentors."
5,Great Handheld,"I purchased the iPAQ 3765 2 1/2 months ago and have been very satisfied with it. I sync with my desktop everyday without any problems, the screen quality is great and the color is vibrant. The contact, appointment, task features are cool too. If you like to stay organized for a decent price then this is PPC is for you!"
5,Awsome!,"Before I lost it... it kept on surprising me with all the new features I would discover... handwriting recognition, word completion etc. What an awsome tool! Totally functional, way better than any palm wished it could be. It makes use of the whole screen instead of keeping a third cut off to write on.. what if your not writing? It has the best color screen in different lighting of all the handhelds (I checked them all) and the processor speed (compared to the hp) is way faster. Audio sound is excellent through headphones, but don't expect it to replace your car stereo without them. I'm getting another as soon as possible."
3,Poor battery life. Large size. No integrated media slot.,The battery life is pretty bad. Battery looses it's charge after a few days even if you don't use it. Had to buy an extra charger for the office. Device is never ready when I need it.Device is large and troublesome to carry around. Grip is a little slippery. Newer models have integrated CF or SM slots. Wish I had spent the extra money for that.Otherwise it's nice. Bright display.
2,I'm Not Surprized...It's a Compaq Right!,"I like the features of the unit. The PC compatibility, the ease of the async software and the display. However, like many many others, I am very disappointed with the longevity of the battery life. To put it bluntly, It SUCKS! Maybe 4-6 hours in the standby mode while not in use and at best 1-2 hours when on. It must stay in the charger to be any good at all. Also, with no backup battery to hold data, a long day or trip is out of the question unless you can charge in route. My advise...look at another option to purchase if you need to use this other then on your desk and in the charger cradle."
5,Big Smile,Couldn't be happier with this unit. The vendor even contacted me the same week to make sure I got it and it was working fine. I thought that kind of service was a lost art. I'm very happy and have already recommended this vendor to others at work and at home.
5,Has more to offer than expected!,Not only is it windows compatible but you can hook up a wireless air card to do all sorts of things ranging from receiving and sending email to using a digital camera to upload pictures. Customized forms can be added for business uses. Lots and lots of fun!
1,Bad customer service,"I got the iPAQ 3765 around Christmas 2000 and immediately preferred it over my old Palm. Easy to use and very fast. I do wish that you didn't need the additional sleeve for the expansion memory and the battery loses power rather fast.The biggest con of having an iPAQ? The customer service. They apparently lost my rebate information and refuse to discuss the matter. This isn't first time that I've heard of thtis happening. Based on my recent experience I would suggest looking elsewhere considering the cost of this PDA.What a headache this has been. Yes, bad enough to warrant one star for this review."
1,Read the fine print!,"If you want to use this Pocket PC at work, don't count on it! Unless you want to send an extra $25.00 to Compaq so that you can sync it with your NT desktop. My old HP Jornada didn't have any problem with NT. I wonder why Compaq doesn't support business software?"
4,Great unit compared to the competition,"I was a little peeved to find out that while I paid 500 bucks for the 32/16 (Ram/Rom) ipaq with PocketPC 3.0, this new one has 2002 and is 64/32 for same price. (A bargain to you a pain to me) but anyway its amazing. Only reason I gave it a four as opposed to a 5 is i recommend spending a little more for the futuristic iPaq not yet out but it will have 16Bit display ( a must for videos )"
2,faulty batteries not charging at all.,"It is the right equipment but, the batteries are not charging at all. I have left it on charge for more than 10 hours and as soon as we get it off the main it goes off. It is only working when connected to the power outlet. Hence any data saved and the settings are deleted once the power is disconnected. It therefore cannot serve the purpose for which we were bought for.I need urgent advise on what to do with it. Return it to the supplier?"
2,Would be great it if worked,"I've had intermittent problems with the touch screen. No matter how many times I align, after a while it gets messed up. I think it might be nice little machine, but in it's current state is unusable. And having ordered it from Amazon means that it's not easy exchanging it for one that works."
5,iPAQ stomps the competition,"Christmas 2001 turned out to be the defining moment for pocket electronics in our household. 3 family members each received a different brand and so far the iPAQ has come out ahead for ease of use, speed, and the popular ""cool factor"". Pitted against the Casio color BE-300 and the Handspring Visor (and the now retired Palms), the iPAQ has been the ""lemme play with it"" gift of the season. Great graphics, clear sound, easy interface,and it's speed have made it a winner. Downloads for games and utilities are abundant on the internet and simple to load into the iPAQ.Don't miss the opportunity to own this gem of electronic genius."
2,I thought it was a good deal....but,"I purchased the iPAQ 3765 to replace a Casio E-115.On the plus side:- The screen is more visible in daylight.- It is slimmer & weighs less- Comes with updatable ROMThe minuses:- It locks up all the time, even when just sitting in the cradle.- To use any expansion items, including a memory card, need to buy an adapter which makes it bulkier & weigh more than the Casio ever did.- Adapter for cards uses more power, so need to ensure keep recharged more often.- No backup battery. This is really a stupid design flaw.- Problems with trying to synchronize with multiple computers using different types of cradles (USB vs. serial). When going from one to the other, more often than not doesn't recognize the device. Which means I have to do a soft reset to get it to work.- Trying to get Compaq to respond is like pulling teeth, painful and leaves you with a loss.Overall, if I had to do it over again, I'd buy the new Casio which is what I plan on doing in a few months anyway."
4,I should have said this as the best but... for one reason...,"When I decided to buy compaq iPaq 3765, I based all my judgements on the customer and editorial reviews on this site and it proved to be correct and worthy suggestions.Its really the best I could efford for the money by features by value ratio. Nothing gainst it. Its all fun for kids and perfect assitant and reference for busy professionals.I should have said that the Pocket PC is the best, but, just for one reason, There is no real protective cover comming with the device for such neat best visible screen. Compaq should have considered putting one hard slide cover.But still I suggest you purchase this PPC. iPaq 3835 does not seem to have given more options to invest more. So, you get the point..."
5,"Good quality, delivered on time","Good quality, delivered on time. I would buy this brand (Monster) from this supplier again."
4,Monster Cables,"As always, Monster Cable is a quality product. I don't mind paying the price for a quality item. Monster comes through every time, and Amazon comes through with a great price on a quality item. You can't find these anywhere for a price like this."
4,Mayonnaise - Mayonnaise,"The trio of Mayonnaise features Howie B.'s trademark abstract downtempo, with Crispin Hunt and Will O'Donovan on vocal duties. The results come off quite well -- going from O'Donovan's emo vocals on the ""Death Defying"" to Hunt's more aggressive stylings on ""To My Head."" Howie B's musical eclecticism is on full display as well: from the swinging growl of ""Because of the Weather"" to the melodic glitches of ""Let's Get Out"" or the delicate romanticism of ""Wild-Eyed Soul"" or ""Sky Came Down."" Instead of your normal emo, here's electronic emo! Guess which one is better?"
1,Classic Comedy 8 Disc Set,"Abbott and Costello are my personal favorite comedy ever. I would give this a 0 star rating for the simple fact nothing is mentioned as to what is on these disc's. Is it their tv shows, movies, interviews, trailers or what?"
4,Get This Gem While You Can,"As fragmented as this set is, it contains portions of what is considered one of the two ""Holy Grail"" concerts: full, uninterrupted versions of Thick as a Brick, Aqualung, and Songs From the Wood ( MSG, 1978 ). A different, full version of Aqualung is available on the 25th Anniversary DVD ( from the other landmark show, BBC Sight & Sound 1977 ). Since these vintage shows apparently won't be released anytime within the foreseeable future ( ditto this video being released on DVD ), this is as close as we're going to get to pristine footage of what I call the Mark II lineup of Jethro Tull. I don't know if it's ""legalize"", bad blood between former members of JT and Ian Anderson, or simply that IA wants only footage of the current lineup of JT released. But, for now, this is apparently as good as it gets for the Tull fan."
3,Jethro Tull - First 20 Years,"I expected a comprehensive history of the band. There is some good live footage from 1978, and decent interviews with Anderson and Tull Fans. But a great amount of the songs are the cheezy videos of the 80's and the like. I never knew Tull fell into that crappy promo stuff, but I guess they played those music videos in Britain more than the US. Some reminded me os ZZ top , less the furry guitars !! More live footage, and more historical stuff would be welcomed. It's OK , but not a great overview of Jethro Tull !!"
3,Good reference but needs more examples,"The Whole Life Adoption Book was required reading by our adoption agency. It contains a lot of good information on adoption for all different types including: domestic, international, foster-care, birth, older child, etc.While we will keep the book because of some good sections we can use for reference, I felt that the majority of the stories and examples came from the same families or always related to adopting a child at birth. Some other items are never addressed in the book such as: Cost, CPS' role, process of adoption (international, private, or foster-care), etc.I know the author wanted to keep the book to a manageable length and the items that are missing can vary in each state, country, and situation, but more information could definitely be given."
4,"Great book, great price!","We have been thinking about adoption, so when I saw this book for a good price on my Kindle, I snatched it up quickly!Bottom line: This book is very good. It gives an overview of adoption, lots of comments from adoptive parents and adoptees, and a special emphasis on attachment problems that can occur with adoptive children.If you are thinking about adopting, have adopted, and/or are concerned about attachment disorders in children, I recommend this book."
1,Wished I had known it is published by a group w a religious agenda,I think I will still read this but I was VERY disappointed to see it was published by a group with a religious agenda...I wish amazon had a way of indicating this.
1,"Mis-labeled - orignal, not updated version","When I ordered this book I expected to receive what was advertised on Amazon, however when I received the book it was slightly dirty and is the original edition from 1993, not the updated 2008 version, please be aware."
5,Impressed with the quality,"Bought this for my 18 year old grandson for Christmas and the quality is great. Priced them at a local discount store and although they didn't have this particular one, all the men's Timex watches anything like this one was much more expensive. My grandson had no trouble setting the time and date without having to read the directions."
3,Looks good --- loses time,"The watch has a good classic appearance and feels good on the arm, but after wearing it for several days I found that it would lose about 10 minutes a day. This is not good for a new watch so I returned the watch without any problems."
1,NEVER WORKED,"The watch was sent to me keeping time poorly. I took it to my jeweler to replace the battery and he said the battery was fine, but they dont work on timex watches, bacauce they are so cheap. The watch was taken apart and I had links taken out, and I could not return, due to notice given. (no returns given if the watch is altered) So, I am out of $40 bucks"
3,Great Size for a Little One BUT Doesn't Stay Inflated.,"This beach ball doesn't remain inflated and has been that way since we took it out of the box. Maybe there is a pinhole somewhere we can't see, despite pouring over it to discern where the leak is. We don't see any tears at all, but this ball will not remain inflated for more than half an hour. During that half an hour, though, my toddler LOVES this child-sized beach ball. We just have to keep re-inflating it."
3,Quick shipping,"I just started using it. the shipping was fast, no clue if the product is working, the shampoo and conditioner are nice, but the ""extract"" you use after just smells like rubbing alcohal and the spout to pour the few drops out of pulls out like a water bottle making it difficult to not put too much on, but we will see if it works."
3,side cover goes way,"the sides protectors just too easy to brake appart, the sound is ok for regular street users low rms speakers not much, does not blow womem dress way."
5,Larger Size,I wish it came in a larger size but the product itself is great. I use it on my stretch marks
4,Good oil for scars,This is my second surgery and it is a good oil combined with vitamin E and other scar healing products.
5,Your Face Will Thank You,"I have found this cleansing lotion to be of the finest quality available. It is worth every penny.You don't have to use much, a little goes a long way.I found out a long time ago that using plain facial soap is harmful to my skin. I tried so many varieties, with little success, until I found this product. As a result, I've been using this exact product for four decades. Having been told repeatedly that I look much much younger than I actually am, I credit this product, and a good vegetarian diet, for my glowing complexion. I am grateful that Aubrey continues to manufacture this product year after year.There is not praise enough regarding this magnificent lotion."
5,The best of its kind.,"This is the only cleansing lotion I have ever found that I can actually use. It is very gentle on my face. It gets all the makeup off, and it doesn't dry out my skin. In fact, it does the opposite, it makes my skin look younger. The entire Aubrey line is excellent, but I have to say, this is their crowning jewel."
1,dont see any diferent,"I put in my son hair that is haf and haf, and i dont see any result, is the same..."
1,too big,This shoe was way too big. I missed the deadline for returns so I'm stuck with it. Anyone want it?
1,"Used, Don't Bother!","At a glance product looks identical to new version, but there are some differences. Professor would not except. I contacted seller & they were very nice, but with return shipping & restocking fee not worth the effort to return! Stick with Used books from your college bookstore!"
4,from the BestWeddingSites.com editor,"Michelle Kozin guides you through a wealth of information we should all be more concerned about. Ideas and real eco-minded weddings are described. Brides and Grooms-to-be could use this soft-cover book as an easy take-a-long planning source. Professionals answer how-to questions. Earth friendly advice that's within our reach in this all to easy to throw-away culture. From ink use and its alternatives, to ideas for great food to enjoy, all keeping in mind the term, ""it's better for us and our environment."""
4,Good details,It's awesome when you want to look up some detail in physiology. Goes into details and help you understand the whole picture. I use it as a dictionary to look up different parts of the big picture.
5,EXCELLENT Physiology BOOK,"this book is the best medical physiology available.. its well explained, covers every aspect of the human physiology es the best book to survive medical school"
3,Great book.....but,"I think Guyton's a good book, but the content is recitative. Its great for med students who do not plan to go into Internal medicine.A little superficial on neurology and Neurophysiology as well as Respiratory physiology.I loved it till I found Ganong's!"
2,Title should be: Concepts Made Complicated,"Ok everyone raves about this book. It is true that this book covers everything you need to know. However, the trick is not to get lost in their ridiculously long explanations that are repeated over and over and over each chapter. Seriously, this book could be condensed to half the size. Further, they mention a couple sentences about a concept and then quit and say ""more on this to come later"". They probably do that about a thousand times. Truthfully, i just got annoyed by reading the book. It is obnoxious and everything, from their graphs to their flow charts, is made to sound more complicated that it has to be and is encoded in erroneous/needless fluff. Medical students do not have much time, THAT IS TO SAY time is valuable, WHICH MEANS there is not much of it, SO YOU COULD CONCLUDE you should use time efficiently AND THIS MEANS... - if you found the previous sentence pointless and annoying, go with something else, perhaps BRS!"
5,"""Guyton"" is synonymous with ""Physiology""","Dr. Guyton is a giant in the world of medicine and science. He left a legacy of teaching generations of physicians. In addition, he raised 10 children, all of them are medical doctors in different specialties.This book is the most renowned book in physiology, and the most respected among physiology professors.His style is simple yet unattainable.The book remained a single-author textbook for decades, except for the latest edition. This gives the book a universal balance in content and style.I never stopped reading this book over long years of my medical career.This book for me is science, art, fun, and nostalgia!"
2,Not a good book to study for the boards.,"Reading Guyton in medical school is extremely difficult. The book is extremely dilute and very comprehensive. It is so comprehensive, in fact, that it doesn't teach you what you need to know for the boards. If you want to learn all the important points and skip the garbage that isn't important at all, like how pH monitors work, then buy the pocket version of this book. It can be read much faster and it has plenty of detail to it. I highly recommend doing this if your med school class is using Guyton. I also found it helpful to supplement the pocket book with a review book that has questions."
2,"Repetition, lengthy discussions, and omission of important facts","Let me start by saying that there is diversity in learning styles and it varies by your background, intellects, IQ, etc. A book that I may find tedious and too detailed may be a great source for another student.For me, this book was too repetitive, lengthy, and time consuming. My peers, most of whom had high school education and little or no college background, were appreciative of Guyton because it repeats over and over to embed a concept. If you are a student that needs to see a fact several times to ""get it"", then this may be it. But at the same time, younger students had difficulty extracting important content from dense chapters.The advanced learners and those with higher education may find this textbook dull and repetitive. In addition, when compared to Ganong and other physiology texts, Guyton lacks important facts needed for school and board exams."
2,Bad bad bad,"I ordered a book that said it was in good condition and i paid for two day shipping. The book did not come due to shipping issues through the post office for a month but I never saw the extra money that I paid for two day shipping. Also, it was rated in good condition but when it came, the spine was literally falling off. ALtogether, a more than disappointing experience."
2,failed refund,"i attempted to contact the seller via email to return the book because although i was told i needed it the book for class i actually did not. The seller has yet to respond. so i have a book i cannot use and paid $70+ for it. The condition of the book was good, i have no complaints about that."
3,Not what i expected,"I am a single older woman who is planning to travel alone. I expected, by the title, to find anecdotes and tips for women traveling alone but found very few of them. I did find reference to 3 books written by a 'loner' that i will probably buy sometime in the future. The book WAS well written, just did not fit my needs"
3,Not Quite What I Was Looking For...,"This book was good. But, based on the information in the description I was a little disappointed.I was looking for a book written by single women RVing alone. There are a couple of stories in the book written by a widowed woman, but the rest of the writers are traveling with their husbands/families.As just an ""RV Life"" book I'd give it a 4."
2,Not a book for the solo traveler,"Going your own way: Some women travel alone by choice. In other cases, circumstances--a divorce or death of a spouse--may leave a woman without her travel partner. These women share stories of what it is like being a solo traveler.This quote is from the Amazon review and what I thought I was buying. I am well over half way through and have yet to find an essay written by a woman traveling alone. These women are passengers on the journey, not pilots and their essays reflect this. While some of the essays are well written, overall the book was a disappointment."
3,"Women's tales on the road, just not single women....","As a single woman about to leap into, or at least sidling towards, a solo life on the road....I had hoped that that was what I was reading my way into. As it turned out, RV Traveling Tales is a grouping of women's insites, through short stories from their life on the road. They are not single ladies facing the road alone from that unique perspective, except for one. This is a sweet little book on the personal sides of their lives. Enjoyable, but not terribly informative.I did enjoy the stories, but I guess I was thinking and hoping for more of the 'teachable moments' from the perspective of the lone women road warriors facing their inner selves as they work through their life on the road. That's a whole different kind of critter."
3,Peaceful & Calming,"I enjoyed this CD very much, I found it calming, especially during the early morning hours during the Christmas season."
3,Soothing Calming elevator type music,"This would be good to play at work or at a party or just to calm all those Christmas stress nerves. Nothing stands out as being great, just good background music."
1,Hopelessly inaccurate,"Craig Cheetham needs a fact checker. He frequently writes opinion as fact which is contrary to actual sales figures, track times, factory specs. Sloppy journalism."
5,excellent help,"This book was fun and easy to read. The examples given were easy to relate to. I read it cover-to-cover in just a few days, and read about half aloud to my husband while doing it. I found immediate help in these pages. While there's been no change in my ""step-wife's"" behavior, there has been a real change in my attitude and my behavior and in how I deal with her. I actually bought a copy and gave it to her, though I've never heard a word from her about the gift. It has helped me understand my husband's position, as well. Whether my step-wife reads it or not, I've gotten priceless peace from this book. The kids, the real point of the book, will be the ones to benefit the most."
4,Great for some peace,This makes you take a look into that other woman's life. It forces you to possibly gain a little knowlegde about the ex. It was great to finally feel a little of much DESERVED peace in my life.
1,NOT Epson brand ink!,"I bought this ink -- which is clearly labeled on this page ""Epson S020189 and S020191 Ink Cartridge Twin Pack"" and the photo shows that it's Epson ink. What I actually got was no-name ""Epson compatible"" ink. Make sure you check to make sure you're actually getting what you're buying!"
4,"Generally solid, and a terrific price","This Beethoven set probably won't win any awards, but considering the price, it's surprisingly good. Richard Edlinger's conducting is straightforward and no-nonsense, and the Zagreb Philharmonic produces a solid, dark Beethoven sound. Unfortunately, two of the symphonies (3 and 6) are performed by the CSR Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Halasz, and are noticeably weaker. Halasz's conducting is perfunctory and the CSR, whoever they are, has a thinner-sounding string section. The recording quality is excellent, however, and the price is unbeatable. If you're a cheapskate Beethoven fan, grab it.One minor point ... Amazon describes this as a ""box set."" It isn't; it's in a foldout cardboard container (which is slightly too large to fit into a conventional CD storage rack)."
3,Not entirely successful,"The performances on this set range from D- to B-. The best are the 5,7, and 8 and the worst the 3 and 6. It seems clear that Edlinger is an able Beethoven conductor and his orchestra is basically fine. His interpretations are also really good on the 7 and 8 though the 5 is a little fast and lightweight for my taste. The other conductor is just well..unlistenable. Maybe a set that is good across the board is not to be expected at this price. My recommendation would be to save for the Karl Bohm cycle on DG, which is available on three doubles(and includes overtures), and supplement that with Giulini's wonderful no.5 with the LA phil."
2,Incredibly huge!,"The fabric of this shirt seemed nice enough, but the shirt is incredibly HUGE! I bought the XLT, same size as I order in other brands, and this one fit me like a dress. I'm 6'4"" and about 245, wear at 48L jacket. This shirt went down to my mid-thighs, and the shoulder seams were a good 4"" down from my shoulder. Since it's a shirt meant for working out, I just don't think it needs to be this huge. I don't have the physique for wearing tight fitting stuff, but normal t-shirts just need a couple extra inches on the length and an inch or so on the sleeve. I was very hopeful when I ordered this t-shirt but wound up pretty disappointed."
1,No indication they were Russell,"The shirts had no labels, and no Russell logo on the sleeve. Amazon customer service first said the ad photo didn't show a logo (they are on the sleeve and wouldn't show), but then accepted my point that without a label and logo there was no evidence they were Russell (like a Nike shoe without the swoosh) and re-ordered the shirts, while emailing me a paid return label. The service was excellent. I suggest buyers check for label and logo on these shirts (which are good.)"
2,bad size,"the size is really bad, i ordered 4XL but it came bigger than what i imagined and it's very tall too!The fabric looks good... but didn't actually tried it since it's too big for me..."
1,Hole in pocket,"Hole in pocket, not completly sewn.Charcol heather shrank 2 sizes.Blue shirt pocket was placed almost under the sleeve."
1,boring and seemingly endless,"This book was recommed to me in an online discussion group for classics, so I ordered it and looked forward to reading it. However, I never really got into it, I tried very hard several times, there are hardly any books I have not finished but with this one I just couldn't make myself read on. There are endless descriptions of what various members of the Fairchild family think and do during a long hot week. The style varies, depending on which persons thoughts we are following, but the thoughts are so boring and the writing doesn't help either. After about 100 pages I gave up and I couldn't even think of someone who I could give this book to."
1,Pure drudgery,"I must admit I have not yet finished Delta Wedding. If I do, it will be by sheer force of will. It is a laborious read. Nothing has drawn me into this book and the authors run-on style is tiresome and confusing. I often have to re-read a long convoluted sentence and then ask myself, ""Just what is she trying to say?""I realize I am in the minority, but this book is not the least bit enjoyable to read."
3,"Recommended by a friend, but...","Thought I would LOVE this story, but...I did enjoy the idea of the story. But there was just something about the characters that I couldn't like. Maybe that was her point. But I'm a Jane Austen/Charlotte Bronte/Dickens kinda reader & I like my characters clear-cut & my story to resolve well. I wasn't sure when this story was over, that it was really over. Sorry, friend who recommended it, but I guess I'm not a Eudora Welty fan."
2,Much ado about nothing!,"Although the book is beautifully writen, the plot is pointless and the much expected revelation about a family secret or some terrible sin never arrives. A bit dissapointing . . ."
1,Disappointment,"This is the first I've ever read of Eudora Welty, and I found the book to meander aimlessly and end inconclusively. I'm still not sure what the plot was or who the central character was. Also, I found the Fairchild family very self-absorbed and uninteresting. But, I got the sense I was supposed to be awed by them. The only interesting character was Laura, but she remain undeveloped throughout the novel. Granted, Welty offers some beautiful descriptions of the South and various characters, but they don't make up for an overall poor read."
2,John Gray coddles men in his books,"The first time I read this book (YEARS AGO) I thought it's tips and suggestions might be helpful. I applied many of the tips in my communicating with men I worked with and the man I was involved with. I found myself coddling these men. I found that I was walking on pins and needles around these men, because I was trying to be empathetic towards their needs and less about mine. I then read many of Patricia Evans' books (e.g. The Verbally Abusive Relationship, etc.) and found out that I worked for and was involved with verbally abusive men. John Gray's tips and suggestions just made the verbal abuser's behavior towards me even worse. I picked up the audio book at the library just recently and listened to it. It made me cringe listening to it. I had flashbacks to the abusers I was involved with at the time I first read this book. I would not suggest this book to anyone, especially someone who is involved with verbally abusive men/women."
1,Not worth a rating,This was supposed to be a new book and a gift at that. It was signed by the previous owners parents. How do I give it as a gift to my co-worker now? I gave it one star cause I had to in order to complete the review.
2,"Mars Are From Venus, Or Vice-a Vers-a!","Okay, this book is pretty dumb and very general in its take on men and women, and yet there are moments of insight on the opposing sexes dynamics. Overall though, there is nothing here that none of us don't already know, and there's plenty here that seems more inclined to draw lines in the sand between us sexes rather than showing us how much alike we are."
3,Was Benjamin Franklin a double spy during the Amer Rev.?,"The story deals with an interesting idea, as posed above. For the most part, it's on the predictable side but, the author, being a lover of History, puts painstaking details into the times. He even has footnotes at the bottom to explain various points.That said, this book is more of a two star quality if you aren't a History enthusiast of the American Revolution. If you are, then this is about a three star book b/c of all the wonderful details. Story telling quality is below average."
5,THE BEST remedy for upper respiratory ailments,"It certainly doesn't taste good but the effect is well worth the taste! It loosens up any tightness & wheezing & clears out bronchial infections promptly. Most people aren't aware that Osha root is an herb that has strong antibacterial/antiviral properties for the lungs. I've been able to avoid the use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis with this formula on several occasions, of course it's always best to see your doctor/naturopath if you feel infection may be present. I always keep a bottle of this handy during the cold & flu season to offset our family's (including our 6 year old) upper respiratory ailments. An excellent product!"
2,Too Lightweight and Wobbly,"I have gotten other value stands but this is the thinnest and most wobbly stand ever. Its good for say a splash, it sways all over the place with a 16 inch crash. Even with the base spread out as much as possible."
4,pacific drums stand,it is what it is a low budget stand you must know going in. if you want a great stand to beat to death spend more$$$!
4,Good Stands for the Money,"I needed a couple of extra boom stands instead of a regular stand for a couple of my cymbalsand set these up and I am pretty happy with them.. They could have been a litte taller, howeverthere pretty good duty and do a good job for the money. You could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra. I would buy more if I needed them."
5,A Surprisingly Imaginative Story,"All too often in fiction and science fiction, the aliens just look like people with an odd skin color or forehead ridges, or are very obviously based on animals that come from Earth. It is incredibly rare for someone to attempt to make aliens that are both alien and plausible. While a couple of things in this book struck me as unlikely, or required a more in-depth description to justify, overall the author made a great attempt to justify aliens that are very different from us while being believably alien.My only real complaint is that the description of the species and the ecosystem seemed to be a bit lacking, and could have used greater descriptive detail. But to see a high caliber work like this is so rare that it isn't as noticeable as it could have been."
3,"Great, but not super-great","The fictional planet of Darwin IV is a beautiful and interesting place for any wildlife artist (sauch as Mr. Barlowe). His artwork is fabulous and the individual animals are interesting and workable. However, although the animals are inteesting in and of themsleves, besides certain universal features (like the absence of eyes and jaws), they seem to have nothing in comman. While all Earlthly land vertibrates have or had four limbs (hece the name terapods). Barlowe's creations all seem to have different numbers of limbs and no explanation is given as to why. There is also none of the intricate ecosystems that grace Earth. It seems that Mr. Barlowe has created many different biotas and crammed them together on one planet. I suggest this book for fun and for its great artwork, but not for it's scientific value."
3,A interesting but short book,"This book was interesting with various different stories about different women in the ultra-Othordox faith. However, many of the stories were too short for my liking, and often, they were not that interesting. It's a shame since it was a good idea just not written out that well. It's still a good read, and good for those who enjoy short stories and prefer short books."
1,Disappointing Luvavitch PR,"I had hoped for an unbiased and dispassionate look at the lives of observant Chasidic women, but found this book to be little more than a rah-rah shout out for the Lubavictch way of life."
1,very disappointing,"I really don't like books in which the author ""writes down to"" the readers as if they were children or just simple. This was my feeling throughout the book. The characters were likable and their stories were interesting but the dialog was rubbish. Real people (even very religious ones) do not talk like this. I forced myself to finish the book but I really feel that Sarah was not only a plaster saint but just ""too good to be true.""Summary: Inspiring tales - horrible writing."
2,"Interesting, but...","This book is written on around a 4th grade reading level, so if you are a person who is irritated by this type of writing (and you know who you are!) you might not want to waste your money on this book. I did not think the book was an especially enjoyable read, or containing anything that other Jewish women's books, many of which are much more interesting, do not already have."
2,What a disappointment,"Most activities in this book are only appropriate for very young children. I am a fan of Barbara Sher's other books so I bought this without browsing it first. Many of the '300' activities are chants with various words. For example: ""we've all got a name, first and last, tell us your name and we will laugh"". Another activity is to let the child smell food flavorings. Fun stuff if you're 3 but there isn't much for an 8 year old."
4,A Must for Those with Kidney Disease,"This book is the best out there on Kidney Disease and how to manage it. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think there is room for improvement with regards to diet and menus. For those seeking information on Kidney Disease and how to best deal with it, the biggest frustration is the lack of good information available. The author explains why not much has been done about educating the public with kidney disease. A lot of good information."
2,Low protein?? Not!!,"I haven't read the book. But based on reviews which discuss the ""low protein"" diet, I'd like to comment that most nephrologists have not used that in years for the simple reasons that it debilitates the patients without helping the progression of kidney failure. I am the wife and mother of kidney patients. Presently I am looking for a few books to help my daughter-in-law and son with their diet planning. (A weird Christmas present.) Again, based on the low protein diet, I won't be buying this book. Our family disease is polycystic renal disease"
4,THIS BOOK COULD POSSIBLY SAVE YOUR LIFE!,"Although you probably won't be able to find a doctor to help you, this book was based on 35 years that Dr. Walser worked with kidney disease patients -- trying to save them from dialysis and eventual death. It seems the answer is to become a total vegetarian and limit your daily protein intake. Some doctors will advise you about the low protein diet, but none mention the very low protein diet, which is evidently necessary. I would highly recommend this book, and keep doing your research."
3,Too complicated,"I bought this for my brother in law who was told he is going into kidney failure and may need dialysis if things do not improve. I was hoping this would be a good book for him, but it is way over his head. One of his main problems is hyperkalemia and the book only mentions it briefly. Maybe it is a good book for people who are smarter than he is but he needs something much simpler."
3,Good book Bad diet,The book has a lot of good information but I could not give it a better score because I just hated the diet plan so much. The book was worth the price for the information I got out of it but even my doctor did not like the diet. So see your doctor before going on this diet but read the book.
3,Just did not meet my needs,Just didn't meet my needs. (purchased for my almost 90 year old father) Not to say it wouldn't work for others.
1,97th Birthday,Item came and had a leak in it. We were able to patch and use formy father-in-law's 97th birthday. I don't believe it will las throughanother celebration.
4,all out,This inflatable is really awesome and made of thivk materils. My only complaintiis that they could've made a deflate chamber.. It takes a long time to deflate out a small hole...
4,Loved the book,I had read this book before but had not had it in my collection. It is an excellent portion of the Falkenberg's Legion series.
5,Get the series,"The Falkenberg legion is a great series of books and this one is no different. It helps if you do them in order, but you do not have to. Military Sci-fi without all the darkness in Warhammer 40K series"
